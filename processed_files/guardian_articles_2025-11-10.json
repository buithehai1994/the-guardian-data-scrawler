In his sixth book, Hungarian-British writer David Szalay takes a classic story arc – one man’s journey through life, from childhood to old age – and presents it in a radically new and challenging way, scooping out the interiority that usually powers the novel form.We meet his protagonist, István, as a bored 15-year-old in a Hungarian backwater. He is seduced by a middle-aged neighbour into a relationship suffused with shame and disgust; a confused act of violence knocks his life off course; he joins the military and is stationed in Kuwait; he moves to London and works as a bouncer before the rising tides of global capital carry him, for a while, into the monied elite. And all the while, we are cut off from his thoughts, emotions and motivations: we see only how others react to him, desire him, fear him. The most we tend to hear from István himself is a bland, noncommittal “OK”.It’s a risky strategy, but this narrative flatness hugely pays off: it entices the reader into the yawning gaps in the text as we work to solve the puzzle of István, and it turns a story about one man’s vulnerability in the face of the buffeting winds of fate, and of meaningless, out-of-the-blue tragedy, into a propulsive page-turner. Its starkness blows the biggest metaphysical questions about identity, free will and the purpose of life wide open.From his 2008 debut London and the South-East, set in the world of telesales, to his 2016 Booker-shortlisted novel-in-storiesAll That Man Is, a kaleidoscopic portrait of men at different stages of life, Szalay has followed his own path. He’s fascinated by masculinity, repression, status and sex, as well as migration and the rootless nowhere-places of contemporary Europe. Often he focuses on the kind of working-class male characters who, as Doyle said, don’t usually get “much of a look-in” in literary fiction. The understatedness of the dialogue in Flesh is the endpoint of a bold quest for realism – “the way”, as Szalay has pointed out in an interview, “that people actually speak”.His use of white space in Flesh – the gaps between chapters, in which critical events happen offstage, mirroring the gaps between characters – is also familiar from previous work. The stories in All That Man Is directed a laser-like focus on brief moments in various lives, which together added up to so much more than the sum of their parts. Flesh could also be seen as a novel in short stories, the unwritten and unspoken sections carrying their own power and mystery. Szalay has always been interested in how much the writer can leave out: his 2018 story collection,Turbulence, structured as a series of plane journeys, crisscrossed the globe in fewer than 150 pages. The prose was simple and declarative, but untold depths of emotion brimmed in the spaces between sentences.The question of where our emotions originate, in mind or body, and the interplay between the two is an endlessly fertile one;Szalay has described Fleshas stemming from “the feeling I had that our existence is a physical experience before it is anything else”. The primacy the novel gives to the demands and impulses of the body is another thing that marks it out, especially at a time when so much of life is lived online. This may be a bleak book, but it offers the pleasures of a surprising and difficult thing done very well (though the focus does wobble a little towards the end, when the narrative attention follows characters other than István). Its originality makes it a novel you will think about as well as feel, like a gut punch, in your body.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The BBC’s enemies have taken two scalps and inflicted maximum damage. The shock resignation of the director general, Tim Davie, and the head of news, Deborah Turness, make it look as if the BBC accepts that it does indeed suffer from“serious and systemic” biasin its coverage of issues including Donald Trump, Gaza and trans rights. But in this political coup, only the BBC’s sworn ideological foes think a cherrypicked sample of journalistic errors amounts to “systemic” bias.It was indeed a bad mistake to splice together two bits of Trump’s speech; but it needed a quick apology, not a decapitation. The BBC’s chair,Samir Shah, I’m told, tried to persuade Davieto stay to avoid this apparent capitulation to critics: Davie should indeed have stood his ground, not weakened the BBC by walking away.How right Nick Robinson was on Saturday’s Today programme: “There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organisation that you are currently listening to,” backed up by the veteran broadcaster John Simpson, who said Robinson was “exactly right”. Many more need to speak up everywhere. Boris Johnson said he’d stop paying the licence fee until the BBC grovelled. Bravo again for Robinson’sretaliatory tweet: “Hands up all those who think Boris Johnson is well placed to lecture anyone else on upholding standards & admitting mistakes.” (Attackers calling the BBC a bunch of lefties should remember Robinson is a former chair of the Young Conservatives.)The plotters are in a strong position to wreck from within. Robbie Gibb, a self-described “proper Thatcherite Conservative”, was appointed to the BBC board by Johnson’s government in 2021 and, according to evenBBC News, is seen as a driving critical force within the institution. As for impartiality, as Alan Rusbridgerwrites in Prospect, Gibb “led the mystery consortium to buy the Jewish Chronicle on behalf of a secret backer whose identity has never been revealed. His stewardship of that paper saw it mired in a number of its own ethical and editorial failings”. He was Theresa May’s director of communications and helped bring in as BBC standards adviser Michael Prescott (the two are reportedly friends), who authored the dossier behind the current scandal. Astonishingly, Gibb is also one of those who set up GB News, the platform that wasfined £100,000last year for breaking due impartiality rules.BBC chair apologises for Trump speech edit but defends corporation against bias claimsRead moreThe truth is no one agonises and self-examines like the BBC. Itseditorial guidelines, all 436 pages of them, are the nearest journalism has to a holy bible on impartiality and good judgment. The BBC, abiding as best it can by that text, amounts to our national arbiter of news. Its specialist analysts offer the most expert judgments most people will ever access, such as Jeremy Bowen’s dispatches on the Middle East or Sarah Smith from Washington DC.It bears a near-impossible burden. The BBC will fail frequently in its thousands of hours of output across the world. Large numbers of people (myself included) will often shout at their television sets, gnashing teeth at choices made by the BBC newsroom. Those journalists are fallible, subjected to a cat’s cradle of conflicting pressures to “inform, educate and entertain” while subjected to political, social and religious lobbying. Yet the BBC remains by miles the most watched, listened to and read of all platforms in the UK.It is the most trusted, at 60%, with the FT at 57%, ITV and Channel 4 at 56%, followed by the Guardian at 51% – according to the Reuters Institute. (Telegraph trust stands at 42%, the Mail at 24%.) Having spent seven years in a BBC newsroom, I saw how the attempt to walk the line of balance consumes everyone there.As the Telegraph gloats at bringing the BBC low – the BBC plunged into existential crisis,“The future of the BBC is now in doubt”– consider its own contribution to rational political debate. The Sunday Telegraph editor,Allister Heath, regularly pens columns that inhabit a zone planets away from what was once reasonable conservative discourse. Some recent headlines of his: “The awful truth about the BBC is now too monstrous to hide”; “Starmer’s monstrous tax lies will trigger a revolt of Middle England”; “Starmer has declared war on Western values”. We also shouldn’t forget the commercial incentives behind BBC attacks; profit-seeking news organisations, from Lord Rothermere’s group to Rupert Murdoch’s, have plenty of reasons to relentlessly savage the BBC and its market share.The next person brave or foolhardy enough to take on the mantle ofBBCdirector general will face yet fiercer warfare. Tasting blood, the right will redouble its efforts to destroy the organisation for good. Nigel Farage (38 BBC Question Time appearances and counting) is committed to abolishing the licence fee and now speaks of it being “slimmed down”. The Tories compete, with Kemi Badenoch pleased her “heads should roll” line has been delivered. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, often well ahead of Labour, denounces a “strategy by the hard right to replace the truth with propaganda”.The BBC shouldn’t need defending when 12 million people watched the Celebrity Traitors final live, when Strictly, Blue Lights and a host of other triumphs defy better funded streamers, whenmore than 90% of peopleuse a BBC service every month, 74% every week. No other broadcaster would puthalf its jobs and producersoutside London. Though suffering30% cuts in the Tory years, the BBC has been ingenious. But this is no time for cutting the World Service that carries the UK’s voice, values and influence to 453 million people weekly worldwide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The right has a long agenda of national treasures that it wants to trash (it even tried tocrush the National Trust). Its patriotism is highly selective and phenomenally perverse, its targets often running against the grain of public opinion. But here’s a warning: leaving the European Union in the early Ukip days was also a minority obsession.The BBC is always in the right’s firing line, with the unpopular licence fee a useful weapon. That makes it crucial for the forthcoming review of its charter to find fairer alternatives to this poll tax. It should be adapted to people’s means but not left unprotected to general taxation, where the BBC would sink under other budget priorities. Its enemies hate the BBC with the same venom they detest the NHS, as publicly owned and popular social endeavours. Can the institution survive? Words often attributed to Nye Bevan about the NHS apply equally to the BBC: it “will last as long as there’s folk with faith left to fight for it”.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBBCOpinionTelevision industryTim DavieSamir ShahNick RobinsoncommentShareReuse this content"

We asked medical professionalsMadeleine AggelerMon 10 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 13.26 ESTShareTrying to grow your hair? If so, here’s what social media suggests: shampoo daily; don’t shampoo daily; avoid sulfates; embrace sulfates; use protein treatments; absolutely don’t use protein treatments; trim your hair regularly, but not too regularly.Is that helpful?The wealth of hair care advice available online is often meted out by telegenic influencers – not medical professionals. Such tips promise you the thick, glossy mane of a thoroughbred, but are based more on vibes than actual science.In particular, it’s easy to turn new ingredients or formulas into buzzwords. But many products that promise hair growth have not undergone proper research and testing, so it’s unclear whether they can actually do what they promise, says Dr Luis Garza, professor of dermatology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.So how does one actually grow longer, healthier hair? We asked experts.What is the process of hair growth?Hair grows in three phases, explains Dr Sindhuja Sominidi Damodaran, a dermatologist in the hair loss specialty group at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.First, the anagen phase is the active growth phase of the hair cycle, Damodaran explains. The length of this phase depends on where the hair is: two to six years for hair on the scalp, for example, or just a few months for eyebrows and eyelashes. “The longer the hair is in the anagen phase, the lengthier it gets,” Damodaran says.The catagen phase is a transition phase. It marks the end of active growth, and lasts two to three weeks. The telogen phase is a resting phase; follicles are dormant and no new growth occurs. This usually lasts about three months.These three growth phases are followed by the exogen, or shedding phase. Old hairs fall out, and in their place, new shafts of hair begin their anagen phase, restarting the cycle.Hair grows asynchronously, so different strands can be in different growth phases. According to board-certified dermatologist Dr Elyse Love, at any given time, approximately 85% to 90% of hairs are in the anagen phase, 10% to 15% are in the telogen phase, and 1% are in the catagen phase. As for the exogen phase, humans generally shed 50 to 100 hairs per day, Damodaran says.What determines hair length?The two main factors that determine hair length are the duration of the anagen phase, and hair breakage.“Those with longer anagen phases naturally have longer hair,” explains Love.The length of one’s anagen phase is largely determined by genetics, but can also be affected by hormones, nutrition and environmental factors, says Damodaran.However, it is hard to calculate the length of your anagen phase, says Damodaran, because there are no commercially available tests.Even with a generous growth phase, hair needs to stay intact and undamaged in order to grow to its full potential length. Unfortunately, popular styling methods and treatments can often do more harm than good to our tresses, experts say.“The most common cause of hair damage is probably hair treatments that are excessively drying,” says Garza. When hair getstoo dry, it doesn’t have enough moisture and oil to maintain its natural texture and structure, and is therefore more susceptible to breakage.Such treatments include those that apply excess heat to strands, like blow drying, curling or straightening; and those that apply harsh chemicals, like bleach or chemical relaxers.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Regularly wearing tight buns or braids can also lead to a hair loss condition called traction alopecia, says Love. These styles pull at the hair, and over time, this leads to hair loss. “This most commonly affects the frontal hairline, but can potentially affect any area of the scalp,” Love says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHair type is another variable to consider. Damodaran explains that straight hair tends to be mechanically stronger and harder to break than curly or coily hair. Therefore, people with coily hair should use protective styles, and avoid aggressive brushing and combing. “Curly hair benefits from deep conditioning and moisture retaining products,” while straight hair “does well with lighter products to prevent greasiness”, she says.What are effective hair growth techniques?There are many types and textures of hair, but “hair growth strategies are the same” for all, says Love.Maintain a healthy scalpBesides avoiding harsh, drying treatments, one of the keys to achieving healthy hair is to start at the root. “A healthy scalp is essential,” says Love.Researchhas shown that a healthy scalp plays a vital role in the production of healthy hair.Garza recommends washing the hair “with a regularity that prevents dandruff” and to prevent it from getting dry by using conditioners and scalp oils.Different hair and scalp types will require different shampoo frequencies. “Those with straight, thin hair will likely wash multiple times a week, while those with coils may wash once a week,” says Love.Use products that are proven to workFor those people struggling with hair loss or thinning, experts recommendminoxidil(US brand name: Rogaine; UK brand name: Regaine), a medicine that can stimulate hair growth in adults. It can be used as a topical foam applied directly to the scalp and is available over the counter. Dermatologists can also prescribe oral minoxidil, in pill form.Love says that other effective prescription options include spironolactone for female pattern hair loss, and finasteride for male pattern hair loss. It is best to consult with a dermatologist before using any of these options.Stay calm and eat a balanced dietFinally, tending to one’s hair often requires tending to one’s overall health. Damodaran recommends keeping stress levels under control – activities like yoga and meditation can help – and maintaining a balanced diet. Iron, zinc and vitamin D are especially important for hair growth, she says.Be careful of loading up your shopping cart with hair growth supplements, Damodaran warns. “If you have a balanced diet and no deficiencies, there is no need for supplementation,” she says. “Excessive supplementation can lead to other problems, including hair loss.”Are there treatments for severe hair loss?If you continue to experience hair loss, it’s important to properly identify the underlying cause, because that will determine the best treatment. Some autoimmune conditions, like alopecia areata, respond best to corticosteroid injections, while female pattern hair loss may be treated through hormone regulation, says Love.Damodaran also points to conditions like telogen effluvium, or hair loss that occurs as the result of physical or emotional stress like surgery, hospitalization, exams or other major life events. Fortunately, she says, the condition “tends to improve on its own in four to six months once the triggering factor is resolved”.If you can’t figure out the cause of your hair damage or loss, seek professional help. “It’s helpful to see a board-certified dermatologist for a treatment plan, even if you ultimately prefer non-prescription options,” says Love.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyWomen's hairHair lossfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s for an excitable four-year-old or a beer-loving adult, there’s an Advent calendar for pretty much everyone.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But how do you know what’s worth splashing out on, and what’s not worth the money? We’ve tested, tasted and played with 26 Advent calendars to rate them for you. Whether it’s whisky or Squishmallows, here are our verdicts.The best UK Advent calendars for 2025FoodView image in fullscreenTracklements£25.25 at TracklementsThis 12-door calendar is designed for the, you’ve guessed it, 12 days of Christmas. Tracklements makes excellent versions of everyday condiments such as wholegrainmustard,mayonnaiseand ketchup. And while opening those doors may not feel especially festive, having a variety of sauces to pep up your Christmas leftovers will be incredibly welcome.There are a few more special sauces, such as sweet mustard ketchup and apricot and ginger chutney, and everything comes in adorable teeny tiny glass jars. Tracklements is a certified B Corp, too. Plus, the calendar itself is made from FSC-certified cardboard, making all the packaging fully recyclable.Monica HorridgeView image in fullscreenWalkers shortbread£24.99 at Selfridges£20 at AmazonThe shortbread in this Walkers calendar is undeniably tasty – buttery, with a nice crunch – and comes in various shapes and finishes, from chocolate-chip rounds and salted-caramel squares to plain shortbreads. The calendar is festive, with playful line illustrations of bakers in Christmas hats and lots of red tartan.Each biscuit is individually wrapped in plastic, which is recyclable at supermarkets, and you can recycle the cardboard sleeve and plastic inner at home. If you love shortbread, or have a sweet tooth, this calendar is a delicious daily treat, but at £20, it’s not quite special enough to justify the cost.Hannah BoothView image in fullscreenCandy Kittens£12 at Candy Kittens£12 at OxfamBeautifully packaged in striking neon colours, the Candy Kittens calendar provides two to four sweets behind each door. You’ll also find a cute message suggesting a different act of kindness, such as “donate a warm coat or blanket” and the perhaps more cloying, “tell a retail worker they’re sleighing it”. There’s a mix of fizzy and foam gummy sweets in many flavours, from Eton mess to sour apple – watermelon was my favourite.It’s a shame that the sweets are packaged in fairly cheap-looking plastic wrappers, but these can be recycled with other soft plastics at specialist recycling points. Overall, it’s a delightfully sweet (and vegan) alternative to classic chocolate calendars that I could see being a big hit with teens.Lily SmithView image in fullscreenIdahoan instant mash£30 at TikTok shopThis 12-day mash calendar (yes, you heard me correctly) contains packets and “on the go” pots of instant mash in seven flavours that just need boiling water added. I tried bubble and squeak first and, though my expectations weren’t high, I was disappointed – a few flecks of chewy carrot added some flavour, but it was artificially sweet. But I was pleasantly surprised by the butter and herb, which had a more tangy taste from herbs – the flavours were still quite subtle, but not bad for instant mash. My favourite was the bacon cheese; it had a good cheesy taste that wasn’t overpowering, and the bacon bits, though a little hard, added some salty umami.One thing to note is that it is absolutely massive, so not ideal for small spaces. Overall, a good variety of flavours that aren’t bad for packet mash, and you can’t knock them for originality.LSHot drinksView image in fullscreenPukkatea£10.36 Abel & Cole£11.20 AmazonIf, like me, you start to wilt under the sheer excess of Christmas – a chocolate a day, mince pies on repeat, drinks every other night – Pukka’s herbal tea Advent calendar is the perfect, low-key antidote. From Supreme Matcha Green to Vanilla Chai, there’s an organic blend for every mood, and the calendar is a great way to sample new flavours without splurging on full boxes.My favourite teas were the soothing Night Time (chamomile and lavender) and the refreshing After Dinner (cardamom and fennel). The recyclable packaging is disappointingly unfestive, but it hangs neatly on a kitchen wall – ideal if your counters are already buried under Christmas clutter.Ella JinaduView image in fullscreenRisecoffee£40 at Rise£44 at John LewisI included Rise in my list of thebest coffee subscriptionsearlier this year, so I was excited to get into the brand’s Advent calendar. Featuring 24 17g sachets of single-origin coffee – and a mystery gift on Christmas Day – this globetrotting selection takes you to Mexico, Uganda, Peru, India, Vietnam and beyond for the cost of £1.67 per daily cup of delicious, aromatic coffee. As you’re opening a new mini bag each day, the coffee is outrageously fresh, and you needn’t feel bad about it – the pouches are recyclable (not always a given with coffee packaging).The whole box is also recyclable, as you’d expect from a B Corp. I loved discovering the different coffees and found a few new favourites (hello smoky, buttery Cuba), plus the topline tasting notes behind each door are fun. A QR code gives you more information on notes, meeting the farmers and more, should you wish. A great Advent calendar for the coffee curious, and sustainable too.Joanne GouldView image in fullscreenBird & Blend matcha£55 at Bird & Blend (in-store only)If the festive season can sometimes get the better of you, then this matcha calendar might help. Famed for its slow-release caffeine, matcha is high in antioxidants, making it the perfect substitute for coffee. This calendar has 24 pots with 48 cups worth of matcha, and flavours spanning the slightly weird and wonderful. From mince pie to lemon, each is naturally flavoured and vegan.The calendar itself is 100% plastic free, completely recyclable and comes with a step-by-step guide if you’re new to matcha. The only downside is that you need the correct tools, such as a bamboo matcha whisk, to enjoy the matcha properly, and these aren’t included.Charlotte GornallAlcoholView image in fullscreenThe Perfect Measure 25 Whiskies of the World£110 at the Whisky ExchangeI’ve been lucky enough to enjoy a whisky Advent calendar for a few Christmases, and this year’s version is as exciting and festive cheer-inducing as ever. Housed in sturdy cardboard (easily recyclable, bonus), you’re treated to a round-the-world exploration of 25 blended, single malt, bourbon and rye whiskies. Adventure through Scottish, Japanese, Irish, Danish, Australian and American drams, plus a few surprises, with familiar favourites and whiskies that were completely new to me. I really enjoyed a 15-year-old single malt scotch and a couple of experimental liquids from big-name distilleries that aren’t easily available.There’s good value for money here too; some samples retail at about £70-80 for full-size bottles, so it’s a fun way to try before a potential buy. Great for fully signed-up devotees or anyone dipping a toe into the world of whisky to help work out what kind of styles you might like to invest in. Treat yourself.JGView image in fullscreenMoth cocktails£79 at MothFrom a spicy margarita to a piña colada, the Moth calendar contains 24 cans of nine different cocktails. The monochrome abstract snowy scene that adorns it doesn’t scream “Christmas”, but I guess it is festive in a more grownup way. I found the espresso martini had a nice balance of sweet and bitter, and the negroni (which are notoriously tricky to get right, because they can be disgusting if any measurements are off) was beautifully balanced between gin, vermouth and amaro. Moth’s cocktails really do feel bar-quality.Each flap displayed either a quippy message such as “take this and wait under the mistletoe”, suggestions of garnish, a QR code to a recipe pairing or, on the 24th, a Spotify playlist – you can tell a lot of thought has gone into this. My only quibble is that the calendar works out at £3.29 per can, which is more expensive than buying a24-can variety pack.LSView image in fullscreenDrinks by the Dramspiced rum£74.95 at Master of Malt£74.95 at AmazonAll the Drinks by the Dram spirit Advent calendars are brilliant. A smart box of 25 miniatures is an excellent way to get into the festive spirit, and spiced rum lovers can look forward to discovering new varieties without having to commit to a full-size bottle. The vast majority of the samples in this collection are not available as a miniature, so you’re also getting good value for money and an element of exclusivity with this.Filipino, Mauritian, Cuban, South African and Scottish rums pop up alongside the more famous rum-producing countries, and the flavours span anything from pineapple and pink grapefruit to Jaffa Cake and a yum black cherry concoction that peps up a Diet Coke no end. The calendar box is made from sturdy cardboard, and the bottles are glass, so all recyclable too.JGLifestyleView image in fullscreenPapier£140 at Papier£140 at SelfridgesI’ve been obsessed with stationery since I was a child, so this calendar is the ultimate fix. The beautiful cardboard chest it comes in could be reused, and the treats are packed in gorgeous cardboard boxes – a joy to open. The gifts inside range from notebooks to pens, bookmarks, sticky notes, washi tape and a gorgeous mini stamp kit.The downside is the guilt over so much packaging going to waste. Also, do I really need this many notebooks and gold paperclips in my life (although you could definitely pop a few bits in the kids’ stockings)? The cost is a lot for what you actually get, but stationary fans will love it.Suzanne LemonView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ruth Lewy/The GuardianMakeBox & Coembroidery£28 at John LewisI’m an embroidery novice but enjoyed using this charming kit. There’s one Christmassy motif for each day of Advent, and the idea is that it takes just 15 minutes to complete each one (mine took considerably longer!).View image in fullscreenIt includes everything you need, as well as two how-to pamphlets; I was a little intimidated, but the instructions worked well. The packaging is sustainable and low-key, and I found it very calming to stitch in front of the TV each evening. My only complaint is that the finished product is a bit chintzy for my taste.Ruth LewyView image in fullscreenSt Eval tealights£50 at St Eval£50 at AmazonA quietly lovely concept: 24 tealights inspired by winter on the north Cornish coast, with fragrances spanning hedgerow berries and herbs, sea salt and woodsmoke, figgy pudding and festive spice. It comes with a solid clay-pink holder (described as “gold-dusted” but far more understated than that implies), and each window includes a note on its scent. At £50 it’s not cheap, but lighting a new candle each night felt like a small, indulgent ritual. Some scents promised more than they gave off once burning, yet most filled the room with a natural, grownup fragrance – no cloying gingerbread or eggnog here.One word of warning: I found each tealight lasted about two evenings, so either start the calendar early or be disciplined about putting half-burned ones back behind their doors, or you’ll end up with a jumble of unlabelled candles cluttering your side tables.Kate LloydView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emily Goddard/The GuardianYankee Candle£42.49 at Temptation Gifts£49.99 at Yankee CandleTwenty-four days of candles – 12 of which are tealights, 12 mini votives. There’s also a cute glass tealight holder in day one for use throughout Advent and beyond. Scents are, as you’d expect, festive, ranging from the sweet cinnamon stick to the fresh white spruce and grapefruit.Impressively little plastic, with the calendar itself made from responsibly sourced cardboard. But each of the 12 tealights is housed in a plastic cup, which seems unnecessary. I liked how the calendar opened looked like a book, and the vintage-style snow-scene illustrations.Emily GoddardView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lisa Foreman/The GuardianYorkshire Soap Co£35 at the Yorkshire Soap CoA charming illustration adorns the front of this soap calendar, while the inside is more simply decorated. Each of the 12 doors hides a different full-size soap with scents such as Yorkshire Rose and Poppyseed, Honey and Bran, and my favourite, Lemongrass, Grapefruit, Rosemary and Calendula. They all smell lovely and lather well, but unless you’re a true soap enthusiast, there’s limited excitement in unveiling another fragrance each day.Each soap can be either used or given as a gift, so nothing goes to waste. The packaging combines cardboard with a plastic tray, and one drawback is that the doors don’t open very cleanly, which affects its visual appeal when displaying it as part of your Christmas decor.Lisa ForemanView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Ruth Lewy/The GuardianCrochet society£84.99 at the Crochet SocietyThis calendar would make a rather sumptuous present for a budding crocheter. Untying the large box’s ribbon-sealed doors reveals 25 beautiful drawers, decorated in ombre colours with subtle celestial designs. Each box has a ball of yarn and a goodie, including hooks, stitch markers and other genuinely useful accessories. The accompanying booklet contains several patterns; the main “festive blanket”, which you construct by following the day-by-day instructions, and other smaller options (including a scarf, stockings and a hat) if you’d rather go at your own pace. All of them are kitschy, bright and fun.The clear instructions are beginner friendly, with access to video tutorials if you get stuck. I really enjoyed having some regular craft time each evening with short and manageable daily goals (typically two or three rows). The packaging is top quality, and after Christmas, you can turn each drawer around to make an appealing and useful storage box for crochet bits and bobs – of which, as every crafting hobbyist will know, there are plenty!RLView image in fullscreenSockShop£59.99 at SockShopNo one needs 25 pairs of Christmas socks, but this would make a fun family Advent calendar if the flurry of interest it created in the Guardian office is anything to go by. As soon as we opened the handsomely presented Advent box, people were diving in, lucky-dip style, to choose a pair, then immediately began swapping them with colleagues.The socks range from full-on Christmassy (snowflakes, snowmen and Santas) to tastefully festive (deep red) and even plain old dark brown, and are made from bamboo, so nice and soft, but also toasty. They work out at £2.40 a pair, which isn’t bad value, but they are on the thin side, so not destined to become a wardrobe staple. More one for the back of the sock drawer, to be worn again next Christmas.Gavin McOwanToysView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hannah Booth/The GuardianSquishmallowsMicromallows£64.99 at John Lewis£64.99 at AmazonHow many Micromallows – for the uninitiated, soft, palm-sized Squishmallows creatures – does a person need? Arguably, 24 is too many. This calendar features two dozen of them in pleasingly festive guises: baubles, Christmas trees, Christmas puddings, snowmen, reindeer, even dressed in Nordic knits. For a Squishmallows superfan, it’s heaven. For others, like my 11-year-old daughter – a lukewarm fan at best – it felt repetitive, with diminishing returns.View image in fullscreenThe calendar itself is boxy, bulky (though the cardboard box and plastic inner are recyclable) and uninspiring: the numbers run consecutively in a grid format, so there’s no joy in trying to find that day’s door; and even the pictures repeat. My daughter has given half a dozen to friends, but we still have nearly 20 gathering dust at home.HBView image in fullscreenLego Harry Potter£24 at Argos£29.99 at LegoBehind the doors is a varied mix of Lego figures and small builds that you put together to reveal wizarding objects or magical creatures. The builds themselves took about five minutes each, which is probably appropriate for a daily calendar – a little dose of fun without being too time consuming. Even though I’m a big Harry Potter fan, I only found Harry, Draco Malfoy and Luna Lovegood instantly recognisable out of the eight figures.I looked up the rest and they are based on more sideline characters: it feels a bit criminal that you get Hannah Abbott and Angelina Johnson over Ron, Hermione and other more central characters. But it’s still an entertaining calendar that Lego and Harry Potter fans will enjoy. Plus, for £29.99, it’s definitely at the cheaper end of toy calendars.LSView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emily Goddard/The GuardianPokémon TCG£60 at MenKind£52.99 at AmazonThis delighted the Pokémon fans in my family. Nicely presented, but disappointing that it came wrapped in film and has a plastic inner. This is a full 25-day Advent calendar that includes eight festive foil cards, six booster packs, seven fun packs, stickers and coins. By day two, we’d already found a holographic Greninja Ex hyper rare, which I’m told is a really good card.EGPetsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Monica Horridge/The GuardianScrumblescat treats£7.16 at Animed£8.98 at AmazonI wasn’t expecting much from this. Would a cat really appreciate an Advent calendar when they don’t even understand the concept of Christmas? But my cat Bobi became obsessed from the very first door, trying to stick his face inside and pulling the calendar around the floor. The doors aren’t particularly exciting for humans – no festive pictures, and you can’t tell what the different flavours are – and there’s a little too much plastic for my liking. But it’s an undeniably cute way to involve your felines in the festivities.MHView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Emily Goddard/The GuardianPooch & Mutt dog Advent calendar£9.99 at Pooch & Mutt£9.99 at AmazonBehind each of the 24 doors were two “pigs in blankets” treats. I was expecting them to look like pigs in blankets since the box is illustrated with them, but they were clover-shaped instead. The dogs loved them, but there’s little they won’t eat. Why it had to come wrapped in plastic cellophane and with more plastic inside, I will never know, but the outside shell was recyclable cardboard.EGFill yourselfView image in fullscreenFill your own LED Christmas tree£45 at Lisa AngelThis wooden tree calendar has 24 empty drawers for you to fill with treats of your choice. It’s beautifully decorated and has built-in LED lights – making it as much a Christmas decoration as it is a calendar. I particularly love the cute little colourful pompoms and wooden baubles scattered all over it. The drawers are a good size for individually wrapped sweets or other small treats. It’s robust enough to be saved and reused each year, making it wonderfully sustainable.LSPictureView image in fullscreenNational Portrait Gallery£16 at National Portrait Gallery ShopThis joyful, Christmassy calendar by Yorkshire-born illustrator Emily Sutton will charm your socks off every day of December. Behind each window are (mini spoiler alert) well-known faces from the gallery’s collection, and half the fun is identifying who’s who. It turned into an educational exercise with my daughter over breakfast. It folds out, 3D freestanding-style, and the scene is gloriously festive. It’s exceptionally thick and well-made: I bought a previous calendar bySutton– a toy shop – and loved it so much I couldn’t bear to throw it in the recycling bin, so it’s been going for three years and counting now.HBView image in fullscreenAngela Harding bringing home the tree£11.95 at ToastThis beautifully illustrated fold-out calendar from much-loved artist Angela Harding (check out her recentDesert Island Discson BBC iPlayer) displays a classic Christmas scene with a shadowy figure lugging a tree towards a cosy-looking cottage enveloped in snow. Each door reveals a different illustration that is cleverly placed to work within the snowy scene itself, meaning each day adds a new element to the story depicted. Despite the inescapable simplicity of picture calendars, this offering feels special – a truly wholesome way to count down to the big day.LSView image in fullscreenOxfam£4 at OxfamThis woodland creatures picture calendar will delight anyone under the age of six, and probably many of us older than that. A festive illustration hides behind every door, scattered across the domestic scene, and the cardboard is thick and good quality (there’s no plastic). It’s responsibly made, Oxfam says, at a worker-owned site in China with a progressive business model, and sales support Oxfam, so you’ll hopefully feel good about buying it, too. A nostalgic, simple, cheerful calendar that you’d be hard pushed to dislike.HBFor more Christmas inspiration from the Filter, read15 sustainable gifts for young childrenandthe best home giftsExplore more on these topicsChristmasThe FilterAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Amid all the talk aroundLiverpooland their disappointing form at the start of this season, that is perhaps the hardest question of all to answer. What were they trying to do? If it had worked, how would this team have played?The champions spent £424m (about $550m) on new signings in the summer, but if all had gone well, they would have spent an additional £40m ($53m) to land the Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guéhi. The England international would, at the very least, have given an extra option at the back (the injury to Giovanni Leoni has diminished their defensive options further), allowing Arne Slot to rest Ibrahima Konaté, whose poor form continued in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester Cityon Sunday. An early City penalty was a direct result of Konaté getting in Conor Bradley’s way as Jérémy Doku cut in from the left.But Konaté’s partnership with Virgil van Dijk is proven. In past seasons, it has been far better than this. While neither central defender is playing well, Liverpool’s baffling openness this season has been less about individual form than structure – and that’s despite, in recent weeks, returning to last season’s midfield.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead moreAgainst Aston Villa last weekend, Slot selected an XI consisting of 10 players who were at the club last season, plus Hugo Ekitike. On Tuesday, against Real Madrid, there was one further change, with Florian Wirtz replacing Cody Gakpo. Liverpool won both of those games, but neither Villa nor Madrid tested their obvious vulnerability to direct balls played behind the full-backs. Going back to basics, trying to make the transition to something new and more incremental, may not quite have been an admission of hundreds of millions wasted in the summer, but it probably was an acknowledgment that there had been an attempt to change too much too quickly.Soccer teams are delicate organisms. Even on a purely tactical level, without considering the infinite complexities of psychology, changing one element of a lineup has an impact not merely on the other 10 elements, but on the coalitions between them. Take out Trent Alexander-Arnold, for instance, and Liverpool no longer have a player at right-back who naturally inverts to become an auxiliary holding midfielder alongside Ryan Gravenberch, shielding the centre of defense while liberating central midfielders Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai, while also being capable both of sweeping long passes to switch play and accurate quick balls forward to release Mohamed Salah.Slot had become convinced by the end of last season that opponents had worked Liverpool out, to an extent a consequence of the club’s limited transfer activity last summer. There was, anyway, always going to be a moment when this became discernibly his side rather than Jürgen Klopp’s. To that extent, significant change was inevitable and necessary. But what was the intention? If all had gone well, how should this side have looked?Liverpool signed two centre-forwards for a combined fee of £210m ($276m). Perhaps the plan was always to play only one of Alexander Isak and Ekitike, to keep them fresh, to have one always ready to come off the bench, much as West Brom once did with Romelu Lukaku and Shane Long. But given their cost, that’s an extraordinarily privileged position to be in, even if either could theoretically operate wide in extremis and so provide additional squad depth.Quick GuideNagelsmann blames Wirtz's slow start on Liverpool's formShowJulian Nagelsmann, the Germany head coach, has defended Florian Wirtz after criticism of his slow start to life at Liverpool, pinning some of the blame on the team's poor form and finishing.Wirtz, a £100m summer signing from Bayer Leverkusen, is yet to register a goal or assist in the Premier League – though he has created 16 chances – while Arne Slot's side have struggled to sustain their title defence. The attacking midfielder started as Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, a result which left them eighth in the table.Nagelsmann has called for patience with the Germany international, however. \"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo,\" he said. \"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\"If you look at the game against City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes. So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal. You see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"\"We all know what he's capable of and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form,\" Nagelsmann added. \"We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\"\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates. That would be one idea, because ... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"Wirtz is part of Nagelsmann's squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia. Victories in both matches will secure Germany's place at the 2026 World Cup finals.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But where was Wirtz, who cost £100m ($131m) plus add-ons, supposed to fit? He was seemingly promised he would play centrally, which helped persuade him to move from Bayer Leverkusen to Anfield rather than to Bayern. At the start of the season, Slot’s preference appeared to be for Wirtz as a central creator in a 4-2-3-1. But that, it turned out, left Liverpool hopelessly open at the back – something apparent even as they won their first five games of the season.Wirtz may adapt but, for now, he is struggling with the physicality of thePremier League. It’s very hard to see how he and Salah, for whose lack of natural defensive capacity Liverpool have always had to compensate, can play in the same side without risking the midfield being overwhelmed – at least not in the Premier League; Madrid simply did not provide the same physical challenge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if the summer were part of the transition to a post-Salah future, it’s very hard to understand what the plan was, unless Liverpool always had in mind some sort of 4-3-1-2, with Wirtz to play behind Alexander Isak and Ekitike, with width provided from full-back, which would at least help to explain why they signed Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong. In a world of direct play and long throws, perhaps a front two is the next part of English soccer’s 1980s revival.But for now, Liverpool stand as a cautionary tale of how you can take a very good team, throw money at it, and make everything much worse.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

We were in Oregon wine country, in a rustic-chic barn that reeked of stealth wealth, for a friend’s rehearsal dinner. “This venue is perfect,” I told the groom-to-be. He leaned in as if to tell me a secret: “I found it onChatGPT.”I smiled tightly as this man described using generative AI for the initial stages of planning the wedding. (They also hired a human wedding planner.) I responded politely. Inside, however, I resolved: if my future spouse came to me with wedding input courtesy of ChatGPT, there would be no wedding.Some people have the typical relationship non-negotiables. Doesn’t smoke, is a cat person, wants kids. Over the past few months, as warnings of an impending AI-induced doomsday have dominated my news feed and party conversations, I’ve come up with a new one. I will not date someone who uses ChatGPT. (Or any generative AI program really, but with700 million weekly users, ChatGPT is by far the most popular and thus the object of my scorn.)I’ve heard all the “what ifs”.What if I use it for my job, but I hate it otherwise? What if I use it to help people? What if I only use it as a proofreading tool – I’d never use it to “write” anything.To all that I say: there are people out there for you. But I am not one of them.Golden retriever boyfriends and ick lists: gen Z’s dating rules are making them ‘constantly disappointed’Read more“Getting the ick”is what we sometimes call being turned off. Part of having an ick is not really understandingwhyyou found someone’s behavior so unseemly. For instance, I once got the ick watching a man drink a smoothie from a straw. At first, my ChatGPT aversion felt like a mere ick, a kneejerk feeling of disgust that lacked any solid reasoning.But here we are, in fall 2025, and using the program even for benign tasks such as figuring out a fitness routine or deciding what to wear feels an increasingly political choice. We know that the energy-intensive techdrains our water supplyandhikes electricity bills. It is sold as a placebo forhuman connection; lonely, disconnected people finding companionship or evenfalling in lovewith code is not as much a sci-fi plot point as it is just the way things go now. The megarich tech bros in charge of all this think in terms of profit first and people second.OK, so ChatGPT helps you write your grocery list. Does your individual convenience outweigh the societal harm it can cause?As if it hadn’t done enough already, ChatGPT has somehow made dating even worse. A good friend recently told me that she spent a night with a man, and in the morning suggested they get breakfast together. He took out his phone, opened ChatGPT, and asked for restaurant suggestions. Why get close to someone who outsources decisions, including the fun ones like picking where to eat? If someone is so lazy they’ll hit up ChatGPT to plan a first date, imagine how little effort they’ll spend six months in.I just cannot imagine forming a deep, lasting connection with someone who regularly interacts with a technology that’s kneecapping our collective attention spans and perhaps heralding total apocalypse. Intellectual curiosity, creativity, originality – I probably won’t find what I value in someone who thinks “productivity” means asking an app to summarize a movie plot so they don’t have to waste their time, you know, watching it.Ask yourself if your [dating] preference is truly serving your long-term goalsAli JacksonAli Jackson, a dating and relationship coach based in New York, uses ChatGPT for some tasks – but she is not an evangelist. In the past six months or so, she says “every one” of her clients has come to her complaining about “chatfishing” or people who use AI to generate everything on their dating apps – all the way down to the DMs they send. I asked Jackson if my strike against ChatGPT chumps was too harsh. She said no, go forth and judge, though it might limit my dating pool –about 10% of the adult population nowusesthe tech.“Ask yourself if your preference is truly serving your long-term goals,” Jackson said. “In your case, I would assume that’s one of your values, and it’s important to find someone whose values are aligned with yours.”Other people get the AI ick, and not just when it comes to dating. Ana Pereira, 26, lives in Brooklyn and does sound for various live music venues across the city. She fantasizes about going into her phone settings and deactivating AI features on all her apps, though tech platforms from Google to Spotify make it nearly impossible to opt out. Pereira thinks that using ChatGPT “shows such a laziness”.“It’s like you can’t think for yourself, and you have to rely on an app for that,” she said.Two of Pereira’s friends recently had a messy breakup. She sided with one of them after learning the other went to ChatGPT, a notoriously awful therapyalternative, not their partner, when they wanted to talk about their feelings. “It’s like they didn’t want to sit through any uncomfortable human feelings,” she said. “They just wanted to process something and move on, which is not how things work.”Suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work]Luciano NoijeenRichard Barnes, who is 31 and works as a marine biologist and restaurant server in Hawaii, is similarly weary. “I don’t know if I would think differently about someone who uses ChatGPT, but I would be like, ‘come on,’” he said. “You don’t need to rely on it to make a grocery list. Your life is probably not that hard. We can make the list together.”When director Guillermo del Toro said he would “rather die” than use generative AI, it made headlines. Ditto for SZA’s Instagram storiestiradeagainst the tech warning about “environmental racism” and expressing fear over users who are “codependent on a machine”. Ditto still for whenSimu Liu,Alison Roman,Céline Dion,Emily Blunt, and others make statements that are critical of AI in their various industries. I think these quotes go viral for a reason: people agree with them.Even, to an extent, the people who power the tech industry. Last month, Pinterest added a filter that lets usersturn offAI content. Meta lets users mute, but not entirely deactivate, similar slop on Instagram. The Informationreportedthat “cursor resistance” is on the rise, as some Silicon Valley techies won’t use AI to write their code.The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’Read moreLuciano Noijeen, a lead software engineer based in Greece and the Netherlands, told me that he enthusiastically used AI in the past to write or punch up his coding. Over time, he found he could not code on his own. “I’d done it on autopilot in the past,” said Noijeen, who is 27. “Then suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work].”Noijeen stopped using AI to code, and uses it very sparingly in his personal life. He will make fun of friends who use it too much. He recently met up with an old friend who lives a three-hour train ride away. They decided to meet in the middle. The friend said he would use ChatGPT to find the right spot, but Noijeen just looked at a map. “There’s a city exactly between us,” he said. “Why do you need to ask ChatGPT for that?”It’s not that I want to date a machine-smashing luddite (though I wouldn’t beopposed). Naive as it may sound, I want to live a life free of ChatGPT’s chokehold. I recently put this stance on a dating app profile, answering Hinge’s “You should *not* go out with me if” prompt with: “you use ChatGPT for literally anything.” It helps get the point across.Explore more on these topicsDatingRelationshipsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He left that role in the summer.After a week in which the BBC’s leadership had been criticised by its own staff for failing to respond to Prescott’s claims, the corporation’s chair,Samir Shah, on Monday apologised for the Trump edit.Shah said there was an “error of judgment” over the way in which the programmespliced together two parts of a speechby Trump made before the attack on the US Capitol in January 2021.However, in his letter to the Commons culture, media and sport committee, Shah claimed Prescott’s memo was a “partial” and “personal” account of BBC discussions and did not reflect a full picture of the internal discussions and decisions taken.“It is not true to say that concerns have been ignored or action not taken,” the letter added.In a sign of BBC journalists’ view of their board’s management of the crisis, Turness received a round of applause from staff at an editorial meeting.While BBC insiders accept the Prescott letter contains some failings, there is also concern that it has formed part of a political attack on the corporation from within.Concerns centre on the relationship between Prescott and Gibb. Sources said Gibb, who haspreviously been accused of interfering in editorial matters, had “led the charge” at two BBC board meetings that discussed Prescott’s memo. The most recent was last Thursday.View image in fullscreenRobbie Gibb, Theresa May’s former communications chief, was appointed to the BBC’s board during Boris Johnson’s administration.Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty ImagesGibb is one of 13 board members. However, sources raised concerns about the editorial experience of many of the other members. Some newer board members were said to have agreed with Gibb, who has held the post for four years.It is understood that one board member who was supportive of the BBC’s editorial efforts was away for last week’s meeting, in which more pressure was placed on Turness over Prescott’s memo.Insiders said the board’s lack of editorial expertise meant Gibb had “a lot of oxygen in the room”.Suggestions of a political effort to pressure the BBC from the right have been denied. Johnson has rejected any such suggestion as “complete and utter bollocks”. The BBC has said Gibb was only one of a four-person panel that appointed Prescott and only one of 13 board members. In his letter, Prescott said his criticisms “do not come with any political agenda”.Asked to comment on behalf of Gibb, the BBC said it did not comment on individual board meetings and that the minutes would be published in the normal way.In his article for the Guardian, Davey called for Gibb’s immediate removal.“Not only was Gibb the director of communications for Conservative prime minister Theresa May, and editorial adviser at GB News before being appointed by Johnson,” he wrote. “He has also repeatedly been accused of interfering with editorial decisions in a way that is totally unacceptable for a member of the board – especially such a party political appointment.“To ensure the BBC’s independence, impartiality and trust, Gibb should have no role in appointing the new director general. The government should remove him from the board immediately – and end the practice of political appointments, which so badly undermines the BBC, altogether.”The government does not have the formal power to remove a member of the BBC’s board. Gibb’s tenure is due to run until 2028.“That’s for the board to grip,” a government source said. “Our hands are tied.” They added that “we hope all of this can ultimately be a catalyst for change and for the BBC to put itself in a stronger position”.In his response to Prescott’s memo, Shah pushed back against the broader allegations of bias. He said Prescott “does not present a full picture of the discussions, decisions and actions that were taken”. He also said that some of the problems raised by Prescott were not new or had been previously examined by the BBC.“Some of the coverage of Mr Prescott’s memo has implied that he has ‘uncovered’ a list of stories and issues that the BBC have sought to ‘bury’. That interpretation is simply not true,” said Shah. “There is another view that has gained currency in the coverage that the BBC has done nothing to tackle these problems. That is also simply not true.“During the three years Mr Prescott was an adviser to the committee, the BBC produced thousands of hours of outstanding journalism: on television, radio, online, nationally, regionally and internationally. This does not diminish the importance the BBC board places on addressing the issues that Mr Prescott has raised. But it is also important that a sense of perspective is maintained.”The BBC is deciding how to respond to a legal letter to the BBC from Trump’s counsel Alejandro Brito. It gives the corporation until Friday to respond to its demands.It warns that should the deadline be missed, Trump will be “left with no alternative but to enforce his legal and equitable rights, all of which are expressly reserved and are not waived, including by filing legal action for no less than 1,000,000,000 dollars in damages”.Explore more on these topicsBBCEd DaveyConservativesDonald TrumpSamir ShahnewsShareReuse this content"

Other accusations were made over its reporting on Gaza and trans rights.However, the criticisms were all made from the same political perspective: that the BBC’s reporting on such issues was too liberal and that it had ignored such concerns. Sources said that at the meeting, Turness was “on the rack” for more than an hour as Prescott’s criticisms were laid out.“Make no mistake, this was a coup,” said a BBC source.GraphicThe Guardian has been told the board member that “led the charge” over the letter’s claims was Robbie Gibb, Theresa May’s former communications chief who also helped to found the rightwing news channel GB News.Sources said Gibb, who has been accused of interfering in stories where he perceives the editorial line to be left-leaning or “woke”, was “pointed” in his criticisms.Last Thursday, after the Telegraph published its story, more pressure was applied on Turness over Prescott’s allegations, at a second board meeting as members attempted to thrash out exactly what to say in response to the letter.While Gibb was not the only voice pressing the board’s concerns over Prescott’s claims at the meetings, insiders said the board’s lack of editorial expertise meant he had “a lot of oxygen in the room”.Some newer members agreed with Gibb, who had held the post for four years. To compound things, a board member who was supportive of the BBC’s editorial efforts was away. Others felt they were not qualified to intervene. “Robbie and his acolytes are organised and the other side is not,” one source said.It was after that meeting that BBC insiders believe Turness concluded support for her was ebbing away. She decided to quit.The BBC said it did not comment on individual board meetings and that the minutes would be published in the normal way.As BBC staff react with differing degrees of shock, anger and sadness at the whirlwind set of events that led to the weekend’s resignation of Turness and Davie, some are pointing to those meetings as a culmination of a much wider, political story.View image in fullscreenBroadcasting House, the BBC headquarters in central London.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock“Anyone who thinks this is about a 12-second clip on a Panorama more than a year ago that not a single viewer complained about is not reading the proper story,” said one. “What’s going on here is much more about macro politics.”There are differing opinions about the severity of the BBC errors referred to in Prescott’s letter.Many agree there were errors, not least with the editing of the Trump speech – a mistake that Trump has now responded to with thethreat of a $1bn lawsuit.But many say the events of the past week also have to be seen in the context of a wider political effort to shift the BBC’s reporting to the right on key issues.It is a campaign that insiders believe should be exposed. “It was obvious to [Turness] that her job had become impossible,” said one.Those with concerns over the political background to this crisis say it has its roots in Boris Johnson’s time in government and an effort to shift the stance of institutions such as the BBC, seen as too liberal and left wing.And they see a clear line from that decision to the events of the last week. Gibb was placed on the BBC’s board when Johnson was prime minister. The Guardian has been told that Gibb, in turn, was a driving force behind handing Prescott his advisory role on the EGSC – on which Gibb also sits.As a member of the EGSC, which is a small but crucial committee in overseeing the BBC’s editorial output, Gibb also had a say on the issues investigated and the reports commissioned.Gibb has been a hugely controversial figure among BBC staff for some time. He and Prescott have previously been reported to be friends – something they have not denied.All of that contributes to a sense among critics that instead of Gibb reaching a dispassionate view of Prescott’s report, the two men are instead allies in the same cause.Suggestions of a political operation to muzzle the BBC are denied by the alleged key actors.Johnson has rejected any such suggestion as “complete and utter bollocks”. The BBC said Gibb was only one of a four-person panel that appointed Prescott and only one of 13 board members. In his letter, Prescott said his criticisms “do not come with any political agenda”.Many BBC insiders disagree. Some who accept serious mistakes were made in relation to the editing of the Trump speech nonetheless see the Prescott report, and Gibb’s influence in pushing both its author and its findings, as part of a partisan attempt to pressure the BBC from within.“[Gibb] is absolutely central to it,” said a BBC source, adding that the BBC’s editorial leaders had been outplayed. Another said the resignations were a “victory for Robbie Gibb”.There is another ingredient to the crisis that still baffles the BBC newsroom. With the Telegraph rolling out its coverage of Prescott’s letter since Tuesday, why had the corporation remained silent for so long, standing by a strange position not to “comment on leaks”?The BBC’s editing of Trump’s January 6 speech caused controversy – but what did he really say?Read moreInsiders say the truth is damning. They say figures within BBC News, including Turness, wanted to be far more proactive in responding. As early as Tuesday, there was talk of apologising over the Trump edit in order to clear the way for a robust defence against Prescott’s broader allegations of institutional bias.Several sources said Shah blocked this, opting to wait until the board could come to a collective view in its response to parliament’s culture, media and sport committee, whose Conservative chair, Caroline Dinenage, had been expressing criticism over the alleged failings included in Prescott’s letter.A lot of BBC figures are now questioning the role of Shah, who is meant to lead the board and guide discussion. They blame him for allowing a vacuum that was ruthlessly exploited by the BBC’s opponents. Some describe him as weak and “not in charge of his board”.“There was a deafening silence and it got worse as the week went on,” said one figure. Another said Turness was blocked from commenting “by the chair”. A third said: “The Trump escalation could have been avoided if the board had listened and got ahead of it.”By all accounts, there was genuine shock, even among the BBC board, over Davie’s decision to quit. They had seemingly not realised the cumulative effect of the rows that had engulfed Davie’s leadership over the previous year, from Gaza coverage to Gary Lineker’s social media activity.BBC staff also see an irony in the departure of Turness, who will go on gardening leave imminently. Several said she had been one of those trying to broaden out coverage and appeal to Reform voters, including by championing some key Farage coverage during the election campaign. “She was keen to make sure coverage was as accessible as it could be,” one source said. “She was the one arguing [for it].”The departures of Davie and Turness leave the BBC exposed and rudderless as it enters crucial talks over its future and the licence fee.After the resignations on Sunday night, senior BBC editors met to discuss the fallout. “Shock and real sadness” were the overriding emotions. The episode has also left everyone wondering whether running the BBC is even possible in a politically hostile environment.Yet even now, there are obvious questions remaining. Nick Robinson, one of the BBC’s most senior presenters, who has taken up the task of piecing together the events of the last week, observed one of the most glaring.“Neither [Turness] nor the outgoing director general Tim Davie explained what they thought had gone wrong,” he said."

and Sophie Turner Laing, the former senior Sky executive and former boss of the production group behind shows including Broadchurch and Black Mirror.However, Turner Laing, who now chairs the National Film & Television School’s board of governors, has not held a senior executive position at a big media company for five years.The “maverick option” on the shortlist in 2020 was Will Lewis, the former chief executive of the Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones and current boss of the Washington Post.However, allegations aboutLewis’s role in the phone-hacking scandalduring his time at News UK, which he strongly denies, make him too high-risk an appointment at the corporation if he were to show any interest.The fourth candidate to make the shortlist was Doug Gurr, the New Zealand-born former head of Amazon’s UK and Ireland operation.

But the chancellor is also hoping removing the cap, which is popular with voters but deeply unpopular among Labour MPs, will placate many in her party who are concerned about the political consequences ofa possible rise in income tax.The chancellor told BBC Radio 5 Live on Monday: “I don’t think we can lose sight of the costs to our economy in allowing child poverty to go unchecked. In the end, a child should not be penalised because their parents don’t have very much money.”She added: “In many cases you might have a mum and dad who were both in work, but perhaps one of them has developed a chronic illness or one of them has passed away.“There are plenty of reasons why people make decisions to have three, four children, but then find themselves in difficult times. But also you have things like adoption, or foster caring – lots and lots of different reasons why families change shape and size over time.“I don’t think that it’s right that a child is penalised because they are in a bigger family, through no fault of their own.”Allies of the chancellor said her words should be taken as a signal of intent that she wanted to remove the cap in full rather than only in part.Reeves’s comments show how far she has come since the last election, when she and Starmer decided not to include a promise to remove the cap in the party’s manifesto, arguing they could not afford “unfunded promises”. The Resolution Foundationhas estimatedthat removing the cap in full would cost about £3.5bn by 2029-30.Starmer continued to defend that position after entering government, evensuspending seven MPslast year for voting for a Scottish National party motion calling for an end to the cap.In the wake of that rebellion, Starmer commissioned the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, to lead a taskforce to make recommendations on how to reduce child poverty.Phillipson is due to publish her findings around the time of the budget, and is understoodto have concludedthat fully abolishing the cap is the best way to remove the maximum number of children from poverty.Allies of the prime minister insist he has always wanted to remove the cap in full as soon as possible. One said: “Keir has always said he wants to drive down child poverty in government. It would mortify him if it went up on his watch.“He’s adamant that it will dwarf what Blair did to reduce child poverty in government. It really matters to him; it’s something he’s talked about for years. He wants to be able to go into the next election saying that if you vote forLabouryou’ll take more children out of poverty.”Alison Garnham, the chief executive of the ChildPovertyAction Group, said: “The two-child limit is the biggest driver of rising child poverty in the UK and scrapping it in full is the right thing to do. All children are equally deserving of a good childhood and abolishing this cruel policy would give millions more kids a better start in life.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And as a result, we’ve never managed to get our productivity back to where it was before the financial crisis.”Reeves has been considering a plan to raise income tax rates by 2p and cut national insurance by 2p – a move that would raise £6bn and protect most workers while hitting pensioners and landlords.Reports suggest, however, she is thinking of limiting the national insurance cuts to those earning about £50,000 and less, which would mean a significant tax rise for the top 25% of earners.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Child benefitsWelfareLabourRachel ReevesChildrenBenefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

The tussle for power is likely to come to a head in the new year when the party holds a formal leadership contest.Zarah Sultana sets sights on replacing Labour and gaining powerRead moreThe latest rowcentres onhundreds of thousands of pounds’ worth of donations and fees received by MOU Operations Ltd, a company set up earlier this year while the details of Your Party were being thrashed out.Your Party officials have been seeking a sum of about £800,000 from MOU Operations, eventhreatening to take legal actionagainst the company over it.Sultana however has recently taken sole control of MOU Operations and on Monday offered to return £600,000, arguing the rest should be retained in case of future legal or administrative expenses. That offer however was promptly rejected by Your Party officials.A spokesperson for Sultana said: “Zarah is working to transfer all funds and data held by MOU Operations Ltd to Your Party. As sole director, she is legally responsible for ensuring the company’s costs, liabilities and expenses are settled, and this process may take some time.”They added: “The first £200,000 is scheduled to be sent on 12 November. All remaining funds will be transferred once the company’s costs, expenses and liabilities are settled in full.”Your Party declined to comment, but officials are understood to be in the process of rejecting Sultana’s offer. A spokesperson for Corbyn also declined to comment.The party officials argue that Sultana should repay the full £850,000, which they say was collected by MOU Operations in the early weeks of the party’s formation. But they do not want the party to take over a separate pot of money – believed to be about £500,000 – that was collected after Sultanalaunched an unauthorised membership portalon 18 September.Some close to Corbyn believe Sultana is trying to keep money to help fight a leadership contest over the next few months. Sultana’s allies however say some money needs to be held back in case those who donated in the movement’s early days demand refunds.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her TikTok following, for example, is now nearly 490,000, in comparison with Corbyn’s 280,000.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsJeremy CorbynZarah SultananewsShareReuse this content"

The meeting is part of a remarkable turnaround in US-Syrian relations after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, who had prosecuted a deadly civil war in the country from 2011 until his forces collapsed in December 2024.Sharaa, a former al-Qaida-aligned rebel fighter who had previously had a $10m bounty on his head, arrived at the White House on Monday in a dark suit and red tie as he sought to lobby Trump for sanction relief for the former pariah state. Video showed him greeting a crowd of supporters outside in a rare public appearance.“He’s a very strong leader,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “He comes from a very tough place. Tough guy. I like him. I get along with the president, the new president in Syria, and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful, because that’s part of the Middle East.”After the meeting, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced a 180-day suspension of some sanctions under the Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019, commonly called the Caesar Act, which targets Syria’s energy industry and deterred foreign investors from signing contracts relating to the country’s postwar reconstruction.The exemptions excluded “certain transactions involving the governments of Russia and Iran, or the transfer of provisions of Russian-origin or Iranian-origin goods, technology, software, funds, financing or services”.Announcing the sanctions and export control reliefs, the US government said in a press release: “President Trump is delivering on his commitment to give Syria ‘a chance at greatness’ and to let them rebuild and thrive by lifting US sanctions and ensuring accountability for harmful actors.”Sharaa is a former rebel and leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was affiliated with al-Qaida and had been designated as a terrorist organisation by the US. But after his forces toppled Assad, HTS was removed from the list of foreign terrorist organisations, and the bounty on Sharaa was rescinded.The US had said it wanted Syria tojoin a US-led coalition against Islamic State, while Syria had said that it planned to reopen its embassy in Washington after it was closed more than a decade ago under Assad.That announcement was not made on Monday, although Sharaa said the sides had come to a “political” agreement.Asked whether further announcements about Syria’s joining the coalition against Islamic State or on a security pact with Israel, Trump said: “Yes, you can expect an announcement on Syria. We want to see Syria become a country that’s very successful.”Syria’s foreign ministry said it had agreed with the US to integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces into the Syrian army.Explore more on these topicsSyriaDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The former England forward is alleging she was defamed in two social media posts made by the former Manchester City and England midfield player and that dozens of other posts by Barton amounted to harassment.Joey Barton found guilty of sending offensive posts on social mediaRead moreAfter a preliminary hearing at the high court, Justice Lavender ruled in April that two messages posted by Barton about Aluko on X in January 2024 were defamatory, in one case because of its innuendo meaning. The most contentious elements of Barton’s posts were his claims that Aluko played the “victim card” and “race card”.Barton was found guilty last week in relation to posts directed at Aluko, her fellow football broadcaster Lucy Ward and the broadcaster Jeremy Vine. He denied harassment and seeking to cause distress or anxiety.Barton lost a defamation case last year brought by Vine, which has cost the former footballer more than £500,000, according to Vine. Although Barton was cleared last week of a further six counts of sending offensive messages, he may seek to settle with Aluko rather than risk another large payout determined in court.Aluko’s harassment claim relates to messages sent by Barton when he waged a lengthy online campaign against female commentators and pundits last year.Aluko declined to comment when contacted. In a statement released after last week’s verdict she said Barton’s messages had caused her distress and damaged her media career. “Social media is a cesspit where too many people feel they can say things to others they wouldn’t dream of saying in real life under the guise of freedom of speech,” she said. “This is a reminder that actions online do not come without consequences.“The messages directed at me, Lucy Ward and Jeremy Vine byJoey Bartonwere deeply distressing and had a real damaging impact on my life and career. I am glad that justice has been served.”Barton is due to be sentenced on 8 December, with his bail conditions prohibiting him from mentioning the three victims before then. His legal representatives declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsJoey BartonnewsShareReuse this content"

The judges “had never read anything quite like it”, said panel chair Roddy Doyle, who won the prize in 1993. “It is, in many ways, a dark book, but it is a joy to read.”Flesh opens with a shocking incident that unfolds while teenage István is living in an apartment complex with his mother in Hungary. Szalay then follows the protagonist as he spends time in the military before moving to London, where he begins working for the uber-rich. Written in spare prose, the novel explores masculinity, class, migration, trauma, sex and power.Flesh by David Szalay review – brilliantly spare portrait of a manRead moreSzalay was announced as the winner of the £50,000 award at a ceremony held in Old Billingsgate in London on Monday evening. He was previously shortlisted for the prize in 2016, for his novel All That Man Is.The decision to hand Szalay the award was “unanimous”, said Doyle. Joining him on this year’s panel was the actor Sarah Jessica Parker, along with the writers Chris Power, Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ and Kiley Reid.The book “homes in on a working-class man, which ordinarily doesn’t get much of a look in”, said Doyle. “It presents us with a certain type of man” and “invites us to look behind the face.”“Without anybody being consciously aware of it, I was reared, for example, never to cry,” Doyle said. “I became aware of that and decided it was nonsense,” but István is “that type of man”.“Szalay has written a novel about the Big Question: about the numbing strangeness of being alive,” wrote Keiran Goddard in aGuardian reviewof the novel. “Stylistically, Flesh is all bone. Szalay has always been a master of the flinty, spare sentence but in this novel he has pared things back even more brutally.”Szalay’s novel topped a strong shortlist which includedbookies’ favouriteAndrew Miller, with The Land in Winter, and Kiran Desai, nominated for The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, her first novel since winning the Booker with The Inheritance of Loss in 2006. The other novels shortlisted this year were Susan Choi’s Flashlight, Katie Kitamura’s Audition, and Ben Markovits’s The Rest of Our Lives.Asked whether any of the other novels had got close to challenging Szalay’s win, Doyle said “the answer is ‘kinda yes’,” but refused to name specific titles, saying it would be “unfair, a bit cruel”.Born in Montreal to a Hungarian father and Canadian mother, Szalay grew up in London. He has lived in Lebanon and the UK, and now lives in Vienna. After graduating from Oxford, he worked as a financial advertising sales executive, which became the inspiration for his debut novel,London and the South-East. He is also the author of the novels Spring and The Innocent, as well as the short story collection Turbulence.Writer David Szalay: ‘We live in an era of short attention spans – we have to work with it the best we can’Read moreWritingin the Guardianover the weekend on his inspiration for Flesh, Szalay said that the novel was “conceived in the shadow of failure” – in autumn 2020 he abandoned a novel he had been working on for nearly four years that he felt wasn’t working. He wanted Flesh to “somehow express the feeling I had that our existence is a physical experience before it is anything else, that all of its other aspects proceed from that physicality”.His win marks the 10th for publisher Jonathan Cape, an imprint of Penguin, which has the most wins in the history of the prize.Last year’s winning title, Orbital by Samantha Harvey, was also published by Cape.Other recent winners include Prophet Song by Paul Lynch, The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka and The Promise by Damon Galgut.Flesh by David Szalay (Vintage Publishing, £18.99).

Holding the meeting in Budapest would also have offered a significant symbolic win for Putin, underscoring his ability to travel freely on the continent despite the EU’s efforts to isolate him.After the cancellation, Trump has somewhat hardened his tone towards Moscow and introduced sanctionsagainst two of Russia’s biggest oil producers.The key question remains whether Lavrov blundered diplomatically, or whether Washington was always unlikely to agree to a new summit as long as Putin showed no willingness to compromise.Boris Bondarev, a former senior diplomat who resigned publicly after Russia’s full-scale invasion, said it would be highly uncharacteristic for Lavrov to step outside his role as a mere conveyor of Putin’s views.“Putin has been very comfortable working with Lavrov all these years because Sergei Viktorovich is a seasoned bureaucrat,” Bondarev said. “He knows perfectly well that you should never say anything that does not coincide 100% with the president’s position.”“If there is even the slightest chance Putin might not like it, he simply won’t say it. So the idea that Lavrov showed any unwillingness to negotiate, and that this somehow derailed the meeting, is improbable. There is no separate Lavrov line; only Putin’s,” Bondarev added.Still, Bondarev noted it was possible that Putin was now looking to pin the cancellation on Lavrov.“In Russia’s system, the boss can never be in the wrong,” Bondarev said.Lavrov gave an interview to state media over the weekend in what observers said was an attempt to counter speculation that he had been pushed aside. Speaking to the state-controlled RIA Novosti agency, Lavrov said “certain difficulties have arisen” in the peace talks with Washington.Even before the latest commotion about Lavrov’s standing, insiders say his actual influence over foreign policy has dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. He was not part of the tight-knit circle of Putin advisers who planned the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the decision caught him completely by surprise, two sources said.Lavrov’s position was further challenged after Donald Trump’s re-election in 2024, when Kirill Dmitriev – the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund and a close friend of Putin’s daughter – began holding direct talks with members of Trump’s inner circle, encroaching on what had long been Lavrov’s domain.The souring relationship between the two men has become an open secret in Moscow and has at times spilt into the open.Lavrov and Dmitriev clashed last February during peace talks in Riyadh with the US, when the foreign minister tried to exclude Dmitriev by removing the chair set out for him, according to two people who separately described the episode.Dmitriev ended up joining the meeting after an intervention from Putin.“The two absolutely cannot stand each other,” said the former high-ranking official.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You couldn’t help but be inspired’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 10 Nov 2025 09.57 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 17.30 ESTShareRoland Gift, singer, songwriterI was in a band in Hull called Akrylykz. Whenthe Beatcame to play at the Welly club we gave them a demo tape. Then they invited us to tour with them. Later, after they split up, Andy Cox and David Steele were looking for a singer for a new band and they remembered me. Fine Young Cannibals felt right straight away. After The Tube filmed us doing Johnny Come Home, we just took off. Then somebody must have noticed me on telly because suddenly I was getting film offers, and I appeared inSammy and Rosie Get Laidand Scandal.But in my heart I didn’t really want to pursue acting. It felt like being a session musician – you do your bit, then you’re not really involved. So after the band did the soundtrack for the film Tin Men, we regrouped to do a second album. All sorts of names were mentioned as producers including, I think, Phil Collins. Instead, we ended up doing The Raw and the Cooked in a way people say you should never do an album: in lots of different studios with different producers.We did She Drives Me Crazy with David Z in Prince’s studio in Paisley Park, at which point we changed the title from She’s My Baby. I’d never sung falsetto before, but we were labelmates with Jimmy Somerville so he might have been an influence on the way I sing it. The way I elongate some of the words – “I can’t help mysel-el-elf” and so on – isn’t proper language but rules are there to be broken.She Drives Me Crazy went Top 5 in the UK and was the first of our two US No 1s, but it was bittersweet for me. When it was a hit I was reading Money by Martin Amis and my girlfriend chucked me, just like in the book. On the other hand, we’d always talked about wanting to make music that people would listen to many years later – which is exactly what happened.David Steele, bass, keyboards, drum machine, songwriterWe were playing about in the studio when we came up with what became the riff and beat to She Drives Me Crazy, although it was rockier at that point. None of us really liked it and it went into the box of unfinished songs. Good Thing was set to be our “big single” but then London Records wanted us to work with other producers on other tracks. We told them we wouldn’t work with anyone else unless it was Prince. They said “We can’t get Prince!” but did suggest his engineer, David Z, and said we could do it in Prince’s studio, Paisley Park. When we sent David some songs including the beginnings of She Drives Me Crazy, he went: “This is the song! Come over.”David let us use Prince’s room and all his equipment. The Purple Rain guitar was in the corner, his lava lamps were everywhere and the mixing desk had been used by Sly and the Family Stone. You can’t help but feel inspired in that situation, so we tried things such as putting the keyboards through Prince’s wah-wah pedals. Andy played the riff on Prince’s Rickenbacker guitar. David tells a very complicated story of how he got the snare sound by gating it and all sorts, but most of it was just the conga preset on Prince’s drum machine.When Roland came over later from London to do the vocals he didn’t have enough words. I thought of asking Prince to write some for us but that would have turned it into a Prince song. Instead, She Drives Me Crazy was in a notebook I had of song titles. Roland and I finished the lyrics like William Burroughs cut-ups – pillaging a line from another song of ours and such. Roland laid down the falsetto and a normal vocal running parallel, a trick Prince had used on If I Was Your Girlfriend.Prince was around but we were shy and didn’t want to bug him. After She Drives Me Crazy became the first No 1 single recorded at Paisley Park he played it in some of his post-gig jams and we were supposed to meet him properly. We never did, but sometimes it’s good to keep some mystery.Fine Young Cannibals’ career-spanning hits, rarities and remixes collection FYC40 is released on 5 December.

Julian Gerson explains how the two collaborated on the ‘love letter to New York’Andrew LawrenceMon 10 Nov 2025 13.06 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 16.52 ESTShareIn his victory speech after winning the New York mayoral election last week,Zohran Mamdanicame out swinging.The speechincluded,among other dramatic flourishes, a reference to the socialist titan Eugene Debs, shoutouts to the city’s “Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses”, tributes to Jawaharlal Nehru and Fiorello La Guardia, sprinkles of Arabic – and it was all delivered with the cadence and command of a hip-hop emcee. Many who were listening could not help but wonder: how the hell did he pull that off?A healthy portion of the credit should go to Julian Gerson, the speechwriter on the Mamdani campaign who typifies the young, leftwing lieutenants powering this insurgent operation – a 29-year-old outer-borough dweller (in his case, Brooklyn) with unerring message discipline. He is especially unabashed when it comes to the words he puts in his boss’s mouth that draw inspiration from socialist greats and the multicultural city that the Mamdani campaign holds dear.The full transcript of Zohran Mamdani’s victory speech after being elected NYC mayorRead more“When this campaign has sung the most is when it feels like a love letter toNew York,” Gerson told the Guardian.To write the victory speech, Gerson began working a week in advance, collaborating with Mamdani and his campaign consultant Morris Katz on overarching themes, before locking himself in his apartment until he had a draft ready for Mamdani to review on the Saturday before the election. (Mandani never saw a draft of the concession speech, which Gerson said was “not fun to write”.) “Push yourself to think of speechwriting as more than just the written word,” he said Mamdani told him – which is to say the 34-year-old Muslim and Indian Ugandan state assemblyman was already thinking about the space his victory would occupy in the annals of history. Gerson threw out a couple names he hoped to quote in the speech – and recalls Mamdani responding: “‘OK, but can you make sure to quote Eugene Debs?’ And I was like, ‘Actually, he’s already on the list.’”Gerson, the son of a Texas-born mediator with strong ties to the local Democratic scene and a Belgian NYU professor, did most of his growing up in the West Village and attended the prestigious Dalton school in Manhattan. One early exposure to professional writing came when his father, Stéphane, published a book about his younger brother Owen dying in a rafting accident at age eight. “It was a very formative, very hard part of my childhood that taught me how to express myself through the written word,” said Gerson, who gave notes on early drafts.View image in fullscreenJulian Gerson speaks with Zohran Mamdani.Photograph: Kara McCurdy PhotographyGerson got his start in politics as a high school summer intern in Mike Bloomberg’s New York mayoral administration. For university, he went to Middlebury College in Vermont, where he served as the communications director for the Middlebury College Democrats. After graduation, he worked for Manhattan congressman Jerry Nadler – whom he commends for his bravery leading the first impeachment of Donald Trump and for voting against the Iraq war – and did a two-year stint ghostwriting for New York governor Kathy Hochul.Gerson joined the Mamdani campaign in March as political director, soliciting endorsements from elected officials across the state while working with Mamdani to deepen his relationship with a panoply of constituents across the city. “A lot of that was figuring out, how do we get him into parts of Black New York? How do you have him speaking with gay and trans New Yorkers?” Those ground-level experiences wound up supplying Gerson with steady fodder for speeches that would pull straight from the communities Mamdani was courting.For the victory speech, Gerson found the opening Debs quote – “I can see the dawn of a better day for humanity,” alsocribbedby Martin Luther King – inside William Safire’s speech compendium titled Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History. The quote comes from a speech made when the labor organizer and perennial Socialist party candidate was sentenced to prison in 1918 for denouncing the US’s involvement in the first world war. “That’s it!” Gerson recalls saying when he came upon it.Fortunately, we live in New York, inspiration is everywhere, and people are loud and eager to share itJulian GersonIt was in many ways inevitable that the speech would draw comparisons to Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential victory address in Chicago’s Grant park, widely regarded as one of the greatest orations in modern American history. He called it “a formative memory of what a speech can mean and how it can speak to people”, he said. “It was the only speech I really read in depth before I started writing.”Like Obama’s speechwriters, some of whom Gerson said he spoke to for advice, Gerson enjoys the benefit of writing for a deft multimedia performer. In the days leading up to election night, Gerson subbed in for Mamdani to give his voice a break. “At a certain point I would get into it and try to give a performance, and it’s crazy how different and how much better the speech is when you have somebody who just has this innate talent for knowing when to pause, knowing which syllables to emphasize. The most successful speechwriter-principal relationships are those where it’s close to a partnership, where they engage with the material really intensively and make it theirs.”Obama’s many rhetorical imitators in the Democratic party – US senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro – latch on to his pentecostal intonations in their public speaking. But Mamdani, who once pursued a rap career under the name Mr Cardamom and who still psyches himself up for work by playingMany Menby 50 Cent (a vocal critic of Mamdani’s plan totax the rich), embraces the language and swagger of hip-hop. The kiss-off he delivered to rival Andrew Cuomo in his victory speech – wishing him “only the best inprivatelife” while quoting his father, Mario, the former New York governor, without attribution (“A great New Yorker once said that while you campaign in poetry, you govern in prose”) – was a mic-drop moment straight out of a New York rap cypher.“We all know Mr Cardamom exists in the world,” Gerson said. “But when you’re in the midst of a campaign, you have to shave off parts of your life. First goes exercise, then reading, then grocery shopping – until you’re hoping you just make it to election day with laundry. Cultural consumption shrinks too, but music can still fill the liminal space.”View image in fullscreenGerson, then a House judiciary committee staff member, hands out copies of an amendment during a committee markup hearing on the articles of impeachment against Donald Trump on Capitol Hill on 12 December 2019.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesGerson works in his own musical tastes, too. For a May rally, he drew inspiration from a song by the Chilean American electronic musician Nicolas Jaar’s bandDarkside, using a Spanish lyric:si no funciona, no me digas quefunciona(translation: “if it doesn’t work, don’t tell me it does”) – to set the tone for the rally speech Mamdani gavelast monthassailing Trump’s agenda. The campaign’s impulse to tie its populist ideas to musical references is a throwback to the community building and social activism that gave rise to hip-hop’s birth in the Bronx.Mamdani’s victory speech was not a universal hit, of course. CNN pundit Van Jones was among the critics who took issue with a speech he described as “sharp” and combative. “I think he missed a chance tonight to open up and bring more people into the tent,” Jones said.Gerson makes no apologies. “In response to Van Jones: this campaign and this mayoralty will absolutely be inclusive to every single New Yorker. Zohran had that final line in his long list of thank yous where he said: ‘Many of you voted for me, others of you did not and many didn’t vote at all – and I want to be the mayor for each of you.’ To New Yorkers, there’s a genuine eagerness to serve and prove that we’re going to follow through and that this is going to be a great four years.’”Lend me your ears! The art of political speechwritingRead moreMamdani and Gerson wanted New Yorkers to come away from the victory speech feeling as if they would also have an important part to play in the new administration, and that no suggestion was too small. That includes an Arabic line that made it into Gerson’s final draft –ana minkum wa ilaykum, which can translate to “I am of you and for you.” ” One of the “uncles” in Mamdani’s Astoria neighborhood pitched it to Mamdani while he was there shooting a campaign video in Arabic.“When you’re looking for inspiration, you have to look everywhere,” Gerson said. “Fortunately, we live in New York, inspiration is everywhere, and people are loud and eager to share it.”This article was amended on 10 November 2025 to clarify that the Arabic line in Gerson’s final draft was pitched to Mamdani by an “uncle” in Astoria while he was shooting an Arabic-language campaign video. It was also amended to remove an incorrect reference to Gerson soliciting Hochul’s endorsement.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniNew YorkUS politicsSocialismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she has delivered a knockout performance as boxer Christy Martin. Sweeney talks about taking punches in the ring – and in the mediaMon 10 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareThere was much blood and sweat – but few tears – involved in Sydney Sweeney’s transformation into Christy Martin. David Michôd’s biopic of the trailblazing fighter, who hauled women’s boxing into the US mainstream in the mid-1990s, spends much of its runtime recreating Martin’s real-life fights. And she doesn’t always win. I left the screening wondering if I had genuinely just seen Sweeney – whose acclaimed acting career, canny commercial ventures and unwitting contributions to the online outrage cycle have combined to make her one of the world’s most famous women – being mercilessly and repeatedly punched in the head. Turns out I had.“Oh yeah, they were all real. Every fight that you see, we’re hitting each other,” says the 28-year-old cheerily. “I had concussions, there were some bloody noses.” Were the concussions frightening? “Nah, I loved it! The lady who played Laila Ali” – Muhammad Ali’s daughter, who defeated Martin by knockout in 2003 – “is an actual professional boxer. She’s in the air force and fights for Team USA – she hit hard and it was very, very real. She’s how I got my concussion.” Sweeney felt she truly “became a fighter. It was such an exhilarating feeling. In between takes, I’d be like: ‘I think I won that round!’”View image in fullscreen‘I became a fighter’ … in Christy.Photograph: Black BearIn the ring, Sweeney was essentially cut loose from the rest of the production (Michôd says the fighting was “a thing that I had very little to do with; it became a negotiation between Sydney and the stunt performers”). But when it came to bulking up – she gained two-and-a-half stone to match Martin’s fighting weight of “135 to 137lbs” – she had a buddy. On set, Sweeney kindly shared her calorific snack of choice, Uncrustables (this quintessentially American product, which Sweeney ate “endlessly”, is essentially a small frozen jam sandwich with the crusts cut off), with her co-starBen Foster. He also consumed “a lot of burritos” in order better to resemble Martin’s boxing promoter husband Jim. It worked. “I think it was the second week when Syd came up and just started touching my double chin,” recalls Foster. “She was like: ‘That prosthetic looks really good.’ And I said: ‘That’s not a prosthetic.’ I was like: ‘Yes!’” Foster mimes triumph as Sweeney chuckles at the memory.I’m always just me – and what other people put on me is uncontrollableFoster and Sweeney are sitting side by side in a hotel room overlooking the Thames; they are in town for Christy’s UK premiere at the London film festival (Sweeney has no problem watching herself on screen, Foster finds it rather painful: “Sometimes it cuts a little too deep – I love Syd’s approach”). Down the corridor are two thoughtful, softly spoken Australians: Michôd – best known for dystopian thriller The Rover and Brad Pitt Afghanistan drama War Machine – and his co-writer (and partner of 20 years) Mirrah Foulkes.Sweeney’s physical transformation and sporting prowess might be the most headline-grabbing element of Christy, but at its heart the film is a subtle and serious document of an abusive relationship: Jim is a master manipulator who takes full advantage of his position as his wife’s manager. For Michôd, the biggest draw was “the opportunity the movie presented to explore how these coercive control relationships function. I was that kind of run-of-the-mill numpty who couldn’t understand why she didn’t leave him.”The seeds of the film were sown by Michôd’s business partner, who informed him one day that Martin’s life rights were available. His first question was: “Who’s Christy Martin?” Once the director had familiarised himself with her shocking story – largely via Laura Brownson’s haunting Netflix documentary Untold: Deal With the Devil – he met Martin and realised what a compelling, complex character she was. “How this pugnacious, brawling, trash-talking, supreme athlete was actually incredibly gentle and vulnerable and wears her emotional scars so openly.”The real Martin – who now goes by her maiden name Salters – ended up being closely involved with the film, but she was initially unconvinced. Having experienced “a world of gangsters and rip-off artists [in boxing], I think she had the same suspicions of Hollywood,” says Michôd. Gradually, he and Foulkes won her trust. Then they set about looking for a star.Options were limited. “Obviously there are the commercial realities of needing someone of serious social stature,” says Michôd (Sweeney has 25m Instagram followers and is a tabloid fixture). “Needing someone of the right age, a particular physicality, and a hunger for it.” How did he know Sweeney had the right mindset? “You can just tell. I was on a Zoom with her and I could tell that she wanted this really, really bad. You can just feel that energy in a person.” He had the same hunch when casting Timothée Chalamet in his2019 historical epic The King.View image in fullscreenChristy Martin and Sydney Sweeney.Photograph: Joe Scarnici/MLB Photos/Getty ImagesWhen Sweeney first received the script, she didn’t know who Christy was either (“I was actually kind of disappointed in myself. She’s one of the most inspiring and remarkable women I’ve ever met”). Yet she soon realised that “on a lot of different levels I understood and could relate to Christy. She has her fight inside the ring and outside the ring and I fight within my own ring and outside my ring. Misunderstood. Complicated relationships. Growing up as a woman. Carving out our own paths and figuring out who we are.”To play Christy, Sweeney succeeds in pulling off a very delicate balancing act. Initially, this small-town girl from West Virginia is tough but entirely sympathetic: a mullet-sporting basketball enthusiast who refuses to be shamed for being gay. In the years that follow, she discovers a talent for boxing, meets and marries Jim – despite clearly finding him unappealing – and slogs her way to the top of her game. Finally, she’s signed to big-name promoter Don King and becomes a bona fide celebrity, working the chatshow circuit, appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated (headline: The Lady Is a Champ) and almost single-handedly introducing female boxing to the masses. We never stop rooting for her – yet her public persona is a strange, unpleasant beast. Now back in the closet, she makes jibes about other boxers being “dykes” and mocks them as they stagger round the ring in defeat. Meanwhile, she appears on TV claiming to be a traditional homemaker who staunchly refuses to give any support to other women in the sport.Sweeney has had her fair share of negative press, particularly therecent furore about her American Eagle jeans advert, whose tagline was interpreted by some as a nod to white supremacy. In 2022, she faced similar outrage when pictures emerged of guests sporting Maga-style caps at her mother’s 60th birthday party. How does she feel about that? “I think what’s interesting is I’m always myself. I’m always just me. But it’s what other people put on me that’s uncontrollable. Like you’re going to write this article … Then people will read it and have their own perception. So I try and be as much of me as possible, but it’s always through other people’s lenses.”Christy, however, is not being herself. Foulkes puts her aggressively regressive persona down to “this combination of very bad influences [in the boxing world] and also a great degree of self-loathing combined to create someone that was really kind of cruel”. Sweeney sees Martin’s apparent rejection of feminism and embrace of traditional values slightly differently. “I don’t think that she’s anti-feminist, she just wasn’t there to be a puppet for a movement. She was there to go after something that she loved. And what she becomes for other people – the role model she becomes – that’s not her end goal.” As for her isolationist approach, “in boxing, it’s a singular sport, it’s not a team sport. So it’s not like a big community of fighters fight together,” she says, with the absolute decisiveness that accompanies the entirety of her conversation.View image in fullscreenFurore … the divisive American Eagle jeans advert.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesSweeney hasn’t boxed since she finished work on Christy. Seven weeks after wrap, she began filming her next project – the long-awaited third season of HBO’s Euphoria, in which she plays Cassie (one of two Emmy-nominated watercooler TV turns that springboarded her to household name status; the second was privileged student Olivia in the inaugural season of The White Lotus) – “so I had to stop everything and drop all the weight”. As Christy, Sweeney felt “the strongest, full-of-life version of myself”. Was it hard to get back into her previous shape? “It was definitely a mental challenge and almost a physical withdrawal from being able to work out so much, which was kind of like a weird serotonin drop.”As a film, Christy is also an exercise in strange mood swings, lurching from a misty-eyed, feelgood sports biopic to something closer to a horror movie, as Jim’s mistreatment of Christy escalates into almost unbelievable depravity. How did Foster – who is spectacularly chilling in the role – manage to connect with Jim, a man with few redeeming qualities?Christy review – Sydney Sweeney fights a losing battle in cliched boxing biopicRead moreJim’s obsession with controlling Christy “is on paper a difficult thing to find a lot of compassion for,” says the actor. “So I guess in trying to find a brief way to say this: there are a lot of bullies in the world right now. And the way that they control one person or a society – or attempt to – [proves] they’re very fragile, and they’re very insecure.” Jim’s “increasing acts of control,” thinks Foster, were a way to “protect himself”. For Michôd, the key to Jim was identifying “this deeply embedded trauma in so many of these men”. Foulkes found it “important to find some way to humanise Jim without justifying horrific actions and that’s why I think Ben’s performance is very beautifully nuanced because he does manage some moments of humanity for Jim and charm even and brokenness”.At the end of a day on set, Foster found it extremely difficult to psychologically shake off Jim’s abuse. The material didn’t weigh so heavily on Sweeney. “I am capable of turning it on and off very easily,” she says of her ability not to dwell on the disturbing subject matter once the cameras stop rolling. Which isn’t to say she didn’t have an emotional connection to the material. When I mention the Oscar buzz generated by the festival circuit, she immediately deflects. “I mean, I’m incredibly honoured that people are talking that way. But I’ve always said that I did this for Christy. For me, all that mattered was that she was happy with the film and that people get to see her story.”Christy is released in UK and Irish cinemas on 28 November.

This is muck‑and-nettles stuff, yet the sticky November turf is being graced by players who have tasted the very top.Unsurprisingly, Wythenshawe came into the game in glittering form – and showed no mercy in continuing it. They had already picked up some comfortable victories, winning 6-2, 10-1, 7-1 and 5-2 in the league. Cissé, the former Newcastle striker, scored all six against the Merseyside team Collegiate Old Boys last month, a game that nearly 200 people turned up to watch. There are almost five times that in attendance for their latest match, marvelling as the Ammies’ veterans rack up a 13-0 scoreline. Cissé scored eight goals – all in the second half, after he missed a first-half penalty, with Boyd and Ireland scoring two apiece. The names of the stars are on every fan’s lips.View image in fullscreenPapiss Cissé is all smiles as he exits the pitch at after scoring eight goals against South Liverpool.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianIt all started with the former Manchester City man Ireland, who is close friends with the Wythenshawe player Blake Norton and was eager for a Sunday afternoon kickabout after playing a “low-key” seven-a-side with some fellow former pros on Tuesday nights. Ireland, who exhibited some fine touches in the game and started the scoring with an inventive volley before providing several assists for Cissé, enlisted some high-calibre ringers.“I came down in pre-season just because I love playing football,” Ireland says. “I love the fitness side of things. I invited some of the others and slowly but surely everyone wants to play.“It’s competitive and it’s going from strength to strength. I didn’t want it to be something where 15 of us ex-pros came in and took over, I want a good mix with the old vets lads. It’s a nice humbling experience to interact with fans as well. It’s great to give back and the club have been so nice to me. We’re all local as well.”The club has been blown away by the growth of the story on social media and the response of the community. The chair, Carl Barratt, says: “Positive press is always good but we’ve not had anything like this before. I’ve even had one of my family members in Australia send me a message – that’s how far we’ve reached.”Barratt is eager to indicate Wythenshawe’s vets were a force to be reckoned with even before the influx of Premier League talent. Last season they won 30 of 32 games under their manager, Kieran Megran, the only defeats coming in two County Cup finals. It was Megran’s drive, and the involvement of Ireland, that really took things to the next level.View image in fullscreenKieran Megran, pictured before his side’s 9-1 win over St John’s in October, won 30 of 32 games last season.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian“It literally started from a conversation about how we can win these County Cups and suddenly we’ve got all these star players,” Barratt says.“We love it, honestly,” Ireland says. “It’s meant to be fun and casual, but even now my phone is lighting up with ex-players saying: ‘How do I sign up?’ And the turnout today was amazing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You do a token 10-minute warm-up, you’re having a laugh and you have a pint afterwards – it’s as good as it’s going to get. The values are obviously different in professional football, but you can enjoy it just as much. It’s like estate football, which is what you enjoyed as a kid. There’s loads of banter. I was chuckling away on the pitch today.”For Barratt, it has gone beyond just winning matches and that elusive search for cup glory. He has been connected to Wythenshawe for 24 years and oversees their 80 teams across all age levels – involving nearly 1,000 children. He was Cole Palmer’s first coach when the current Chelsea forward was a youngster at the club. Barratt and many others have put countless hours into the club, so to see hundreds gather on a Sunday morning for a veterans game is special.“Ultimately, we’re a community‑owned club and this is highlighting what we do in the area. For what Stevie Ireland has done, because he’s been the catalyst to get people involved along with Kieran, it’s been superb.View image in fullscreenStephen Ireland was the ‘catalyst’ to getting other former professional players involved.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian“Wythenshawe is not the most affluent area but hopefully this can contribute to us getting more players, generating more money and the feelgood factor around the place … you can just sense it.“The other week I was with our president, John Walker, who’s done a lot for the club, and I’m looking across seeing Emile Heskey wearing a Wythenshawe FC striped shirt, standing under the John Walker Stand. So that’s one of the best memories I’m going to have at the club. It’s a funny old game when you see things like that.”Explore more on these topicsFootballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her work has now inspired a Netflix drama,Death By Lightning, starring Michael Shannon as the president and Matthew Macfadyen as the drifter who gunned him down.Death by Lightning review – absolutely nobody plays losers like Matthew MacfadyenRead moreThe series promises toshine a light on Garfield, who rose from poverty to the presidency in the Gilded Age only to fall victim to its toxic political divisions. His tenure was cut short after only 200 days not only by the assassin’s bullet but by medical malpractice – an event now forgotten as surely as the killings of Abraham Lincoln and John F Kennedy continue to fascinate.That tragedy set the table for one of US history’s great “what ifs” with Garfield’s lost potential felt most acutely in the area of civil rights, where his commitment to equality for African Americans might have altered the nation’s post-Reconstruction trajectory.James Garfield III, 58, an athletic trainer and professor from Cleveland, Ohio, adds: “You can’t help but be proud of what he did. He was like a multi-threat: he was a lawyer, he was a preacher, he was a farmer. He was all of these things which also shaped who he was and how he was and everything that we know about him the family carries down with us.”Garfield was the last presidentborn in a log cabin, in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, in 1831. His father died when he was 18 months old, leaving his mother, Eliza, to raise five children in difficult circumstances. An insatiable reader, Garfield worked on canal boats to earn money for an education.He studied law, was ordained as minister, became president of Hiram College in Ohio and was a state senator. In 1858 he married a former classmate,Lucretia Rudolph, with whom he would have seven children. An ardent Unionist, Garfield viewed the civil war as a holy crusade against slavery and advanced to the rank of major general.Speaking via Zoom, Millard says: “When I started researching him, I couldn’t believe it. He was absolutely brilliant. He was incredibly brave. He was very progressive for the time. He was kind. He was a decent human being and would have been one of our great presidents had he lived.”Garfield was persuaded by Lincoln to resign his military commission when he was elected to the House of Representatives, where he would serve as a Republican for 17 years. He was strong supporter of black suffrage, viewing it as a matter of justice and the fulfillment of a wartime covenant.Millard continues: “The speech he gave on the floor of Congress will tear your heart out. He was an incredibly powerful orator and this issue was very important to him.“He wrote an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem while he was in Congress. He was this incredible classicist; he spoke Latin and Greek and knew huge lengths of the Aeneid by heart in Latin. He was an extraordinary mind.”At the1880 Republican national conventionin Chicago the party was deeply divided between the “Stalwarts”, led by Senator Roscoe Conkling, who supported a third term for Ulysses S Grant, and the “Half-Breeds”, who supported James G Blaine. Garfield attended as a supporter of his friend and fellow Ohioan John Sherman.When the 15,000-person convention was deadlocked between Grant and Blaine, delegates began looking for a compromise. Garfield’s impassioned speech nominating Sherman impressed them. During the speech, he reportedly shouted, “And now, gentlemen of the convention, what do we want?” to which a voice from the crowd unexpectedly replied: “We want Garfield!”On the 36th ballot, a stampede of delegates made Garfield the surprise nominee. To placate the Stalwart faction,Chester Arthur, a Conkling loyalist from New York, was chosen as his running mate. In the general election Garfield defeated the Democratic nominee to become the only sitting member of the House ever to be elected president.Millard says:“What would have made Garfield great and what is extremely rare and maybe unique to the American presidency is he didn’t want the job. It’s not that he had never thought about it but he was thrust into it.“He used to call it presidential fever because he would watch people he admired change drastically because they wanted the office so much that they were willing to give up their own values, set aside their own morals in order to get this position, and he was never willing to do that.”She adds: “When he found himself president, he was in this uniquely powerful position because he didn’t owe anyone anything, which never happens. To degrees people lose a little bit of themselves along the way and he didn’t because he wasn’t hungering for it. He was like, well, there’s some good I want to do and here I am so I can do it. Then unfortunately he didn’t have the chance to.”View image in fullscreenJames A Garfield.Photograph: GL Archive/AlamyThe defining conflict of Garfield’s short presidency was his confrontation with Conkling over the “spoils system”. Conkling demanded control over federal patronage in New York, particularly the powerful and lucrative post ofcollector of the Port of New York. Garfield refused, stating the issue was “whether the president is registering clerk of the Senate or the executive of the United States”. He nominated a political foe of Conkling to the post.The confrontation escalated into a public battle but Garfield outmaneuvered Conkling in the Senate. Facing a humiliating public defeat, Conkling and his junior senator resigned their seats in protest. The next day, Garfield’s nominee was confirmed. It was a landmark victory for the power of the presidency over the party machine and for the cause of reform over “boss rule”.But even as Garfield battled the titans of his party, he was being stalked by a disturbed and delusional man who embodied the dark side of the patronage system. Charles Guiteau was a drifter with a history of professional failures, mental instability and physical and psychological abuse in his childhood. He had failed as a lawyer, bill collector, preacher and member of theOneida free-love commune.Millard explains: “He was mentally ill and his particular brand of madness was delusion. He always believed that God had chosen him for greatness. He actually had financially a better start than Garfield but where Garfield achieved and rose, Guiteau failed at everything.“He tried to be a lawyer and failed; he tried to be a journalist and failed; he tried a free love commune and they nicknamed him ‘Charles Get Out’. He was the only one not able to partake in what they had to offer at the free love commune, partly because he refused to do any manual labor. He thought it was beneath him.”But Guiteau believed he had finally found a pathway to success: politics. Swept up in the drama of the 1880 election, he wrote and delivered an insignificant speech, “Garfield against Hancock”, and became convinced in his own mind that he was single-handedly responsible for Garfield’s victory.Under this logic, Guiteau reckoned he had earned a high-level government job. He travelled to Washington and relentlessly pestered Garfield, Blaine and other officials, demanding to be made the US consul in Paris — a post for which he had zero qualifications. He became such a nuisance that he was eventually banned from the White House.As he followed the dramatic Garfield-Conkling feud in the newspapers, Guiteau’s rejection curdled into a fanatical delusion. As he later described it, he woke one night with an “epiphany” he believed was a message from God: if Garfield were removed, the party’s internal conflict would be solved and he would be hailed as a hero.On 2 July 1881, just four months into his presidency, Garfield was leaving Washington for his college reunion. As he walked through the Baltimore & Potomac Railroad station, Guiteau stepped from the shadows, pulled an ivory-handled British Bull Dog revolver from his coat pocket andshot the president twice in the back.View image in fullscreenMatthew Macfadyen in Death By Lightning.Photograph: Larry Horricks/NetflixGarfield cried out: “My God, what is this?” and collapsed on the station floor. When a police officer seized Guiteau, he declared: “I did it and I will go to jail for it. I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be president.”One bullet had grazed Garfield’s arm; the other lodged behind his pancreas. Modern medical historians agree that the wound was not mortal. Had Garfield been left alone, he probably would have survived, as many civil war soldiers did with similar injuries. However, what followed was a catastrophic case of medical malpractice.Millard laments: “Can you imagine a more germ-infested environment than the floor of a train station? That’s where he fell and was immediately examined. People were coming off the streets where there was horse manure everywhere, inserting their fingers in his back, putting him in this horse hair and hay mattress.“At that time, the hospitals were so bad, you only went there to die so they took him to the White House, but the White House itself was falling apart at that point. It was rat-infested.”A doctor with a controversial past namedDr Doctor Willard Bliss(confusingly, his first name was Doctor) took charge of Garfield’s care. He repeatedly probed Garfield’s wound with unsterilised fingers and instruments, introducing massive infection. He invited Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, to find the bullet with his self-designed metal detector but without success.Millard says: “Bliss saw in this national and personal tragedy an opportunity for personal fame and achievement. He was very worried about taking what he thought were risks with the the newfangled medicine, including sterilising and cleaning antiseptic.For 79 days Garfield suffered immensely as the infection spread, developing sepsis and blood poisoning. He lost nearly a hundred pounds, becoming a skeletal figure. One of the last things he wrote was “strangulatus pro republica”,or “tortured for the republic”.Despite the president’s obvious decline, Bliss issued rosy reports to the press, driven by what historians describe as immense hubris. On 19 SeptemberGarfield finally succumbedto the infection his doctors had caused.Millard adds: “It was the most horrific death you can imagine. He was riddled with infection and, when they did the autopsy, there were huge gouges. The fingers had created these burrowing holes through him and they were filled with pus and infection. He lost so much weight and was horribly dehydrated. He almost certainly would have survived had it not been for his doctors.”As for Guiteau, he pronounced himself the happiest he had ever been because he was now a celebrity. Millard says: “He’s doing every interview he can. He’s having his portrait taken. He’s polishing off his memoirs that he had written before.“He writes a letter for theNew York Heraldto publish offering himself to any young woman who would like to marry him but she has to be younger than 30 and wealthy. He thinks he’s quite a catch now and he’s waiting for Arthur, whom he assumes is very grateful to him, to free him and then he expects to run for president himself.”Guiteau’s trial was a spectacle. His defence lawyers argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity and, more pointedly, that the president’s doctors, not Guiteau, were responsible for Garfield’s death. Both defences failed. Guiteau was convicted and hanged, his brain and enlarged spleenpreserved by a museum.View image in fullscreenA still of Death By Lightning.Photograph: Larry Horricks/NetflixThe nation feared that Arthur, the ultimate machine politician, would entrench the spoils system. Instead, rising to the gravity of the office, he became an unexpected champion of reform. In 1883 he signed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which established a merit-based system for federal employment andstands as Garfield’s most direct legacy.Garfield was the second of four US presidents who have been assassinated. The shootings of Lincoln and Kennedy have spawned countless books and conspiracy theories; those of Garfield and, in 1901, William McKinley are little remembered. It was not until 2018 thata marker was erectedon the National Mall close to the spot where Garfield was shot.Millard hopes that Death By Lightning will inspire fresh curiosity or renewed interest, especially among young people, and impress on viewers what America lost. She visited the set in Budapest, Hungary, during filming and is thrilled by the finished product. She creditsMike Makowsky, its creator, writer and executive producer, for doing his own research and offering a faithful portrayal of Garfield.“When we were talking early on six years ago, I told him I understand you’re going to take some creative licence and that’s fine. The one thing I really care about is Garfield’s character. It needs to stay intact because not only do people not know much about him; think there’s nothing interesting to know. You can’t understand the weight of this tragedy unless you understand who he was. Mike succeeded spectacularly with that. You understand who Garfield was.”Speaking via Zoom from Los Angeles, Makowsky says: “Garfield was truly a Renaissance man. He was fiercely intelligent and empathetic and was so ahead of his time on the prevailing questions around civil rights and reforms within his own government.“He believed in universal education at a time where that was not at all a popular notion. He exhibited genuine leadership and I hope that the show is able to successfully make the case for Garfield as one of the great tragic what-could-have-beens in our history. I can only speculate the positive effects that a full Garfield presidency would have had on our country.”Death By Lightning is now available on NetflixExplore more on these topicsUS televisionNetflixDramaTelevisionMichael ShannonUS politicsMatthew MacfadyenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The cheek of it.Donald Trumpdescribing the BBC as “corrupt” while threatening to take legal action. Karoline Leavitt, The Donald’s White House mouthpiece, calling the BBC “100% fake news”. The man has never been known for his self-awareness so it’s safe to say the irony has almost certainly passed him by. If you’re being charitable, let’s just say that maybe it takes fake news to spot fake news.The US president is a master of the lie. Makes Boris Johnson look something of an amateur. Boris always followed a lie with a giveaway smirk. He couldn’t help himself. It was an integral part of his self-destruction. As if, buried deep down in his subconscious, there was a part of him that wanted to be found out.But The Donald does it with a straight face. Knowing that no one dare call him out. During his recent state visit to the UK, Trump told a press conference he had ended a war between Albania and Azerbaijan. A war no one – not least the Albanians and the Azerbaijanis – knew was taking place. Keir Starmer just nodded and said nothing. No point in creating a diplomatic incident. Whatever it takes to stay on the right side of Trump.Maybe theBBCcould learn a thing or two from The Donald. Or even from Boris. Because when push came to shove, its Panorama team didn’t make a very good job of its untruth. Possibly because it hasn’t had as much practice. For the most part, the Beeb aspires to the highest standards of impartiality in its news journalism. Often to the point where it goes out of its way to find a climate change denier to balance its stories on global warming.Yet in the Panorama programme on the Capitol riots, the BBC messed up big time. Splicing together two separate clips 50 minutes apart from the same speech to make it sound as if Trump had been inciting violence.What’s more it was all so unnecessary. Everyone already knew that Trump didn’t accept the result of a democratically held election. There was no need to lay it on any thicker. People understood exactly what The Donald thought. He had been hiding in plain sight. Yet Panorama tampered with the footage and inevitably got caught out. As was bound to happen. After all, it wasn’t even that subtle.Why the BBC is apologising over a Trump documentary – and what happens nextRead moreAnd now it’s open warfare on the Beeb. Apologies and theresignation of Tim Davie, the director general, and Deborah Turness, the head of news, are merely the start of the pile-on. Everyone with a grievance and an agenda are now queueing up to put the boot in. Some within the organisation itself. There’s something uniquely British about that. Anyone not on message in Fox News gets turfed out. In the Beeb, the harshest critics often get promoted to positions of authority. We call it accountability and self-reflection.Bashing the BBC is something of a national pastime. Though it’s hard to find another news broadcaster that is quite as trusted anywhere in the world – not to mention its entertainment, education and sport channels – we Brits like nothing more than to give it a kicking. Some on the right reckon it’s a hotbed of well-off Islington socialists; some on the left think it has long been held hostage by the Conservative party. So you might think it was probably getting things just about right. Up until times such as now when it gets it wrong.First out of the blocks wasNigel Farage. Of course it was. Nige the presenter on GB News, a channel that makes no pretence to impartiality. Nige, the man who makes Panorama look like amateurs in the way he self-edits his own life. As the Reform UK leader tries to position himself as a mainstream politician, his past is increasingly erased.Nige was using the parliamentary recess to hold his customary Monday morning press conference in central London. This time the presser was meant to be about small businesses – his main thrust seemed to be that Brexit had been a disaster; Nige is now almost Trumpian in his reinvention – but most of the questions were predictably about the Beeb.“The BBC is institutionally biased,” he declared. “Just look at the way it covers net zero and climate change.” Nige seemed to think that reporting the science that is accepted by more than 95% of the world’s scientists was a major dereliction of duty. There wasn’t nearly enough coverage for the average climate denier. In the same way there wasn’t enough broadcast journalism for those who believe the world is flat. They also pay their licence fee. Do they not count?Balance was everything. Rather than just showing a programme on the 6 January riots, surely the BBC should have devoted as much air time to how Kamala Harris had been inciting people to march on the Capitol. The fact that she hadn’t done anything like this was not a problem. The Beeb had a duty to make something up. You can’t just have Trump undermining democracy. Because that would be undemocratic. To redress its lies, the BBC should also just broadcast its entire coverage of the riots unedited. Or perhaps not.Nige had been on the phone to Trump on Friday, he said. And The Donald had not been happy. Was this the way to treat an ally, he had complained. The riots would have been sanctified by the founding fathers. A thing of wonder. So Nige was pretty much done with the Beeb. Apart from the BBC World Service. But everything else could go. The days of the licence fee were numbered. He would be talking to Nadine Dorries. Good luck with that. Mad Nad has made a habit of being wrong about almost anything.Other politicians kept a lower profile. Kemi Badenoch put out a statement saying the BBC was institutionally biased. She too reckons everyone who works for them are secret commies. Labour didn’t quite know what to do – on the one hand this, on the other hand that – and only Ed Davey mustered any real support. Yes, it had fucked up but it was still a globally respected broadcaster that deserved our support.It just so happened that as Samir Shah, the BBC chair, delivered his own apologia, the Beeb also chose to announce a second series of The Celebrity Traitors. There’s also the possibility of a further spinoff of The Political Traitors. The only difference being that there’s only one faithful.Explore more on these topicsBBCThe politics sketchDonald TrumpNigel FarageTim DavieTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

Give me gen X messiness any dayMon 10 Nov 2025 11.27 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 12.49 ESTShareIt’s well known that dating apps are a nightmare, that hell is empty and all the demons are on Hinge, to the extent people aren’t really allowed to complain about it any more. It would sound like whining about getting run over after you couldn’t be bothered to use an underpass, so you just ran across a motorway and hoped for the best.And yet, as it was my great privilege listening to some millennials to discover, young people are still going on dates, and a lot still goes wrong, without the involvement of any tech whatsoever. It’s all in that bit of the Venn diagram where “I couldn’t work out what he/she was thinking” meets “I didn’t know whether I was that into it”, which is to say, the grey lacuna marked “nothing happened”. It could be a super-efficient, young-professional walk-through-a-park date, and then nothing happened, or a five-hour pub crawl, and then nothing happened. One young friend went to Spainto see a guy, and still nothing happened. One new acquaintance was on a date with a woman who passed him her knickers under the table halfway through dinner – and yet nothing happened.Yes, of course, we all had follow-up questions, and the answers were: no, she was not the first person ever to have done this, it’s not an outlier date manoeuvre, it’s happened to him multiple times. Though he did concede, usually something happens.I’ve since polled all the other men I know, to see if the underwear thing had ever happened to them. Unfortunately, they’re all gen X and they can’t even understand the question – 15 minutes in, they’re scratching their heads, going: “Run this by me one more time, do I have to go to the loo and take my own underpants off? Wouldn’t it be more polite to keep a spare, clean pair in my pocket and just give her those? If my pants are larger than the actual tablecloth, what then?”The curse of nothing-happening is more than just the waste of an hour or five, worse than a ding to your self-esteem. It makes you feel very alone in the universe, cursed to misunderstand and be misunderstood. Consequently, every effort must be taken before the meeting to signal intention and enthusiasm. But this is much harder than it sounds. There’s almost nothing that can’t be read either way – flirtation, or merely lively chat? – except things that are so explicit that one or other of you will definitely get cold feet before the IRL encounter.Want to go to a UK university? Don’t ask me to help you write your personal statement  | Zoe WilliamsRead moreInstead, there’s a series of graded escalations: text to voice note; voice note to photographs (not nudes! Still lifes). Again, I took these dispatches back to gen X. We’re still, all of us, mystified by the voice note. Why would anyone want to hear me say “ummm” for a number of seconds, then do a little monologue in which I would definitely forget my point halfway through, then an awkward “OK, I’ve taken up enough of your time, if indeed you’re still listening, ha ha! Cheerio!” How on earth would that indicate any kind of gear change?The still lifes, meanwhile: it doesn’t matter what the picture is of, unless it’s of yourself, and that is either trashy or you’re gen Z, and they have their own rules. It shouldn’t be mundane, but it should be an everyday thing – a cheese sandwich, say. The point is (apparently), the recipient knows what a cheese sandwich looks like, so what you’re really communicating is that you want to bring them into your moment. The problem is, once somebody’s said, “It could be a cheese sandwich,” all you can think of is a cheese sandwich. Have I ever eaten anything other than a cheese sandwich? Have I ever had a moment that does not involve cheese? “Could it be a random dog?”, one gen X asked, and I took that back to the younger focus group, and they said no. A dog lands you squarely back at ambiguity. Are you bringing them into your moment? Do you just really like dogs? Or do you want to immediately get married and buy a dog?Long story short, the gen X way is still the best: go to a bar; stare at someone for slightly too long; whatever happens, it won’t be “nothing”.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

So large is the vacuum on the left of politics that his victory will occupy an outsized space for progressives beyond New York City. And so, before I lay too much on his head myself, some caveats. New York is a specific place. It has a specific demographic and economic profile. And Mamdani is a man of a specific background, racial, political and religious. But with that out of the way, I think the successful practice of “identity politics” during his campaign offers some universal lessons.I put identity politics in quote marks because the term now means little that is universally agreed upon. Broadly, it has come to mean something derogatory, kind of in the same way that “wokeness” has. It increasingly has negative connotations: a political appeal to race or other markers of identity that is shallow, rooted in perpetual victimhood, focused only on representation and disconnected from material reality. Seen this way, identity politics is not about universal goals, such as lifting people out of poverty and so mobilising broad coalitions of voters, but simply about visibility.But identity politics as an organising political force has its origins in precisely the opposite idea. Coined by the Black feminist socialist organisation theCombahee River Collectivein 1977, identity politics was defined as a path to a liberation that could only come about through the understanding that systems oppress many different people along the lines of their identity, and so could only be dismantled if all groups worked together. “We believe,” the collective declared, “that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity”, but that “we also often find it difficult to separate race from class from sex oppression because in our lives they are most often experienced simultaneously.”That “simultaneous experience” is what I am talking about here. Mamdani tapped into that. He rooted his campaign solidly in the experience of being a New Yorker, and how the city needed to be made more affordable, then expanded that to include all the ways in which different groups live that experience. He released campaigning videos in Urdu, Hindi, Spanish and Arabic, and consistently made all of them about a retail economic message: rent freezes, free buses, universal childcare, makingNew Yorka place to raise your children and build small businesses. Then he threw in a bespoke little twist. In his Arabic message he quipped that something more controversial than his political message is his belief that the knafeh, an Arab dessert, is better on Steinway Street in Queens than it is in New Jersey. Talk about hitting a sweet spot.Including the languages of underrepresented identities is an exercise in enfranchisement. He quoted the Arabic phraseanaminkum wa alaikum– “I am of you and for you” – in hisvictory speech, and named those “forgotten by the politics of our city”, the “Yemeni bodega owners and Mexican abuelas. Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses. Trinidadian line cooks and Ethiopian aunties”.He combined that with being in the places that working-class people, many of whom are people of colour, occupy. Visiting those on thetaxi ranksand working the late-night shifts, he forged a powerful metaphor of a city that is kept going by those who labour in the dark. And he drew that all together by bringing his own identity, as he himself put it, “into the light”. A Muslim who grew up in the shadows of Islamophobia, he suffered an outrageously racist campaign against him, but resisted the pressure to play down his identity in order to fit in, to succeed. “No longer will I live in the shadows,”he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The coalition that Mamdani built, across all ethnicities, became about closing the yawning gap between people and power. In a revealing contrast to establishment Democrat politicians, when Mamdani was heckled last week over his position on Gaza, he did not say, as Kamala Harris did when she was heckled, “I’m speaking”. Mamdanismiled and said: “I want you to be able to afford this city too, my brother.”But there is something else about Mamdani’s approach that reveals how identity done right is generative. His is a politics that is forged and defined by being on the margins, but not as a single individual who wants to escape alone. Those who see their identity as a way to become part of an establishment that can then hold them up as exemplars of inclusive politics will always have limited appeal, and therefore limited success as changemakers. To see those margins, racial, economic and political, as spaces in which a majority can be mobilised, as spaces where people don’t want to hear about victimhood but justice, is to create coalitions and escape together. It is to reveal to the voting public that the problem is not particular racisms or prejudices, but an entire system that excludes all those who don’t have capital in all its forms.That message resonates with the college-educated white parents who are struggling with childcare costs, as well as the immigrant taxi driver struggling to pay rent. But above all, ironically, Mamdani exemplified the virtues of the American “melting pot”, a nation of immigrants at the sharp end of capitalism who together increasingly recognise all the ways in which the country is failing to live up to its ideals. All the ways in which Mamdani has been fought, not only by the right but by his own party, prove that American liberal politics has long lost its way in its service to capital and its preening approach to identity. What works in New York doesn’t necessarily map perfectly on to the rest of the US and beyond, but Mamdani’s win is a reminder that the people, whatever their identities, all want one thing – leaders who are of them, and for them.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionUS politicsDemocratsNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

The government must defend it from its enemies, within and withoutMon 10 Nov 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 12.36 ESTShareThe BBC is under attack as never before.Donald Trumpand his cronies have it squarely in their sights – and there are no prizes for guessing why. The BBC is the world’s number one source of trusted news, so of course snake-oil salesmen such as Trump see it as their enemy. If your power is built on conspiracy theories and distortions of the truth, the last thing you want is respected, independent journalists exposing that and holding you to account.That’s why rightwing populists have been attacking the BBC for years. Dominic Cummings (remember him?) once oversaw a report that called it the “mortal enemy” of the Conservative party and set out a plan to undermine it with a new “Fox News equivalent”. In 2019, Nigel Farage called the BBC “the enemy”. In 2021, Boris Johnson appointed two Conservative cronies – Richard Sharp and Robbie Gibb – to the BBC board, as chair and non-executive director respectively.And now the president of the United States is getting in on the act. Attacking its journalists as “corrupt”. Rejoicing at the resignation of the BBC’s director general and its CEO of News.Threatening legal action.His White House press secretary even tweetedthat “Everyone should watch GB News!”, as if the US government has a role in telling British people where to get their news.This disturbing escalation in the assault on theBBCshould be incredibly alarming to anyone who cares about truth, accountability and democracy. Trump and his mates are trying to destroy one of our most precious British institutions, and we must act fast to stop them.Of course, the BBC is not perfect. How could it be? I’ve had my share of disagreements and frustrations with it in recent years – not least when it comes to the amount of airtime it gives Farage, without properly scrutinising his record on immigration, the economy or the rest of the damage he’s done to our country. And the Panorama documentary at the centre of the latest controversy clearly got it wrong. As the BBC has now admitted, the way Trump’s speech was edited was an error of judgment and it’s right the BBC has apologised.But come on. Trump complaining about words being taken out of context? Worried that people might be misled? Give me a break. Trump has crippled America’s public broadcasters with funding cuts, banned journalists from the Pentagon, andbrought a $10bn lawsuitagainst the Wall Street Journal. Let’s be clear – Trump and his friends are not brave crusaders fighting for journalistic integrity and factual reporting. They are seizing on a single mistake by one BBC programme as an excuse to undermine the whole organisation. We simply cannot let that happen.The BBC is a little like a wayward family member. I don’t always like what it does, but I will always love it. And I will always treasure it. To save the BBC, we have to make sure it remains focused on its original mission: to inform, educate and entertain. It must not be coerced into doing Trump’s bidding, or bullied into giving undue prominence to the loudest, most divisive voices. The BBC’s strength lies in its independence and impartiality. That has been eroded, not least by Conservative politicians when they were in government. It is critical that we now repair it, to ensure it is properly independent and strong enough to stand up to political pressure, whether foreign or domestic.Fortunately, Johnson’s pick for BBC chair, Sharp, is already gone –he resignedtwo years ago over his links to a secret loan of up to£800,000 to … guess who? Boris Johnson. But Gibb is still there, as a member of the board that will choose the next director general of the BBC – a hugely important decision at this critical moment.Not only was Gibb the director of communications for Conservative prime minister Theresa May, and editorial adviser at GB News before being appointed by Johnson. He has alsobeen accusedofinterfering with editorial decisionsin a way that is totally unacceptable for a member of the board.To ensure the BBC’s independence, impartiality and trust, Gibb should have no role in appointing the new director general. The government should remove him from the board immediately – and end the practice of political appointments, which so badly undermines the BBC, altogether.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For my Unrwa colleagues on the ground in Gaza, the constant fear of being killed by bombs and guns may have abated, but there is still much to worry about – access to shelter, food and clean water remains challenging, and winter is approaching fast.There is no time to lose in tackling widespreadhungeranddisease. The scale ofphysicalandpsychological traumais immense, and expectations about access to healthcare and education are growing. The next weeks and months will determine whether this watershed moment will lead to a new dawn or be a prelude to greater despair.The UN, including Unrwa, has the expertise and the resources to address critical humanitarian needs effectively and at scale. But we must be allowed to work freely and independently, without arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on the entry and movement of supplies and personnel.The path to recovery in Gaza will not be straightforward. The ceasefire is tenuous, withalmost daily breachestesting the resolve of its guarantors. A ceasefire that merely prolongs the absence of war without charting a viable path to peace would only repeat the disastrous mistakes of the past. A truly peaceful future requires a genuine investment in a definitive political solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.Basic security is needed for recovery to take a firm hold. The ceasefire must be buttressed by an international stabilisation force mandated to maintain calm, protect critical infrastructure and guarantee humanitarian access. Such a force would create the necessary space for Palestinian institutions to be rebuilt.Gaza’s children needed a ceasefire – now they desperately need the aid that will keep them alive | Alison GriffinRead moreThe success of a stabilisation force, and the transition from emergency to stability, will also depend on providing Palestinians inGazawith reliable public services and a credible pathway to peace and respect for human rights. This can only be accomplished through a capable civil service that has the trust of the community.We have previously seen the consequences of underestimating the need to provide stable and effective public services – most strikingly in Iraq, when dismantling the civilian administration in 2003 created a governance vacuum that unleashed years of instability. Gaza’s professionals, administrators and community leaders must be part of the solution, not casualties of political resets.Unrwa, with its thousands of Palestinian personnel, has the capacity, expertise and community trust required to provide healthcare, education and other public services to a devastated population. For decades, the agency’s teachers, doctors and engineers have formed a vital part of a functioning system of public services for millions of Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the region.Inits advisory opinion last month, the international court of justice reaffirmed the professionalism of Unrwa’s staff, underlined the agency’s indispensable humanitarian role and concluded that Unrwa remains an impartial and neutral actor.Unrwa’s education services, including a well-regarded human rights programme, will be key to preventing the emergence of radicalism nurtured by the brutal siege on Gaza and the atrocities inflicted during the past two years. Nearly 700,000 children of school age are now living in the rubble, dispossessed not only of homes and loved ones, but also of education. Getting those children back into schools will be key to securing peace and stability for Gaza and the broader region.Beyond humanitarian relief efforts and the resumption of public services, businesses and donors must be able to trust that peace will last, and that reconstruction efforts are not in vain.The people of Gaza need the promise of a normal life, with permanent housing and functioning hospitals and schools. Rebuilding Gaza means restoring governance, justice and the broadly held conviction that peace is still possible within the parameters of a two-state solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today, Israelis and Palestinians are neighbours who no longer know each other, divided by war, growing isolation and mistrust. It is both tragic and ironic, because they share a long and profound history of oppression, grief and loss that most of us could not begin to imagine or understand.Reconnecting Palestinians and Israelis requires deconstructing the systematic dehumanisation that has enabled unconscionable atrocities. It requires acknowledging the decades-long oppression of Palestinians and the deep collective trauma triggered by the attacks of 7 October 2023 within Israel.To achieve a lasting peace, justice needs to be delivered, and healing seriously addressed by both Palestinian and Israeli societies.Philippe Lazzarini is commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (Unrwa)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But when it centres on personal insults, not policies, something else is going onZack Polanski is the leader of the Green partyMon 10 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 08.58 ESTShareSince winning the Green party leadership – and as our party hasrisen in the polls, with ourmembership surging– I’ve been listening closely to what people say when they stop me in the street. The vast majority have been supportive, while those who haven’t agreed with my politics have still been broadly respectful.While I was filming in Clacton, for instance, more than one of Nigel Farage’s constituentsstarted off disagreeing with me, but were open to changing their minds after talking through their concerns, and hearing more about the reality of Farage’s policies.That reception in the street differs dramatically from how my leadership has been met by parts of the media. In a democracy, I should expect a challenge. Indeed, I’m not one to shy away from debate. But the reaction has gone far beyond good-faith questioning of my policy positions, or analysis of what my party is offering.Instead, I’ve been the target of relentless nastiness – ranging from crass insults about my appearance in mainstream news outlets to the attempted ridicule of my politics by influential commentators. Of course, in being hounded by the media I am by no means unique. These attacks are often made on people with less power and privilege than me. How must it feel for members of the public who find themselves in the public eye and targeted by the tabloid media?The bombardment takes different forms – but in my case, it can be distilled into three categories: the legitimate examination of my past, the ludicrous attacks on my personal attributes, and the absurd kneejerk reaction toGreen partypolicies.What’s now clear to me, both from the sheer number of attacks and their increasingly wild nature, is that they are a product of a political and media establishment rattled by a party that’s growing fast and willing to say the unsayable: that our country has been hijacked by those interested only in serving the super-wealthy.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daily MailSo let’s start with my past, which has come under intense scrutiny. First, there’s the Sun article about breast hypnosis. I knew when I stood for leader of the party that thiswould come up, and I understand why people would want an explanation.Long before being involved with the Green party, I agreed to do a piece on hypnosis and body image. The journalist asked for it to be a piece about breast enlargement. I asked for it to be clear that it was their suggestion, not mine, but I should have said no. I went out to clarify that on the radio the very next day. It’s embarrassing, but the desperation with which opponents are clinging to it has been pretty disproportionate. I don’t think there are many TV shows now where I haven’t explained that I was misrepresented in the article.The other thing that gets a lot of mentions is my previous membership of the Liberal Democrats. Again, this is fair to bring up – it’s about my political journey – and I am more than happy to explain that my politics have changed, and that the Green party became my political home because my strengthening belief in social and environmental justice led me to the only party that truly represents those values.But then, there are the personal insults. From Harriet Harmanweirdly calling me“macho” to Jeremy Clarkson’s rant in the Sunday Timesabout my teeth, and the Daily Mail’s Quentin Lettssuggesting that my looksmean I have “shades of Hannibal Lecter”, the attacks have been fairly consistent, and multiplied by a small army of very loud, very online trolls. Those same trolls are also obsessed with the fact that Ichanged my namewhen I was 18 – reclaiming my Jewish ancestry in the processMost striking, though, have been the wild and increasingly absurd misrepresentations of my politics. Just recently the Tory peer and radio host Daniel FinkelsteinclaimedI was “against wealth and growth” when I simply said to him that GDP is a terrible way to measure health and wellbeing. Then there was a Times leader saying that Green policies “hold grave dangers”, Piers Morgan’s franklyweird obsessionwith genitalia and commentator Carole Malone telling the Daily Express that I was a “dangerous man” because I want a public health-based approach to drugs. That doesn’t mean making all drugs freely available over the counter. It means taking out organised crime and the gangs, tightly regulating the market and supporting people who become dependent on drugs with medical interventions, not jail.It’s obvious to me why these attacks have become so ferocious: it’s because more and more people are backing a party with policies that will dismantle the economic consensus and focus relentlessly on the cost of living. Three-quarters of peoplesupport a wealth tax– yet none of the establishment parties will touch it. So parts of the media close ranks when the vast wealth of their owners and the policies of their friends in Westminster come under threat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn the past weeks, I’ve had many interactions with journalists that have been positive, but it’s striking how often commonsense policies are treated as if they’re extreme. From our plans to bring water into public ownership, to supporting rent controls and an end to the “war on drugs” – I follow the evidence from the UK’s failures, and examples from across the world of how to do things better. All too often, such plans aren’t met with fair scrutiny, which I would welcome, but with a sense that I’m presenting ideas from the radical fringes, and that they therefore don’t merit proper discussion.Nowhere is this more apparent than inmy viewson the genocide in Gaza and the actions of Israel. There is an utter disconnect between a journalistic class that nodded along to a boycott of Russian sport after the appalling invasion of Ukraine, while mounting franklyoutrageous attackson those of us who said that Israeli teams should be given the same treatment. This is evidence of a class of people who value independent thought far less than contacts in government. For me, as a Jewish man, to be repeatedly accused of being part of some sort of antisemitic movement is the most galling attack of all. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that across the Atlantic there’s another politician who has faced a whirlwind of abuse and attempted distraction but has maintained his relentless focus on raising people’s living standards.Zohran Mamdani’s victoryhas demonstrated the potential for a city – it’s time for us to do it for our entire country.When I was elected, I said I wanted the Green party to replace Labour as the progressive choice for people. I mean it. One poll in late Octoberput the us ahead of Labourfor the first time and suggested the Greenscould take the seatof Holborn and St Pancras from Keir Starmer. That’s what smashing the stale, old two-party politics and replacing Labour looks like.The bad news for those who attack me is that we simply won’t back down. They can sound off about my teeth all they want. But the more I see them panic about the replacement of the politics of hate with a politics of hope, the more we know our movement is on the right track.Zack Polanski is the leader of the Green partyExplore more on these topicsZack PolanskiOpinionGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

The impression was of anorganisation under siegerather than one confidently self-correcting. Mr Shah will be busy. He must find a new director general afterTim Davieresigned. Gone too is the CEO of news, Deborah Turness. Both resigned after an exhausting rightwingcampaignwhich cried bias at every turn and was energised by an absurd transatlantic attempt to paint the BBC as part of a global liberal conspiracy.A giant like the BBC will make mistakes. The failure is not owning them fast enough and moving on. The corporation remains one of Britain’s few genuinely national institutions – and ministers say it is a “light on the hill” for people here and abroad. The BBC is themost trustedsource of news in the UK, and among the top five worldwide. Yet awareness of that value has faded as the broadcaster struggled to articulate a clear civic mission. This is a strategic blunder in the face of competition from US big tech, which wants to monetise outrage rather than the truth. Viewed from that perspective the current row over the editing ofDonald Trump’s speechfor Panorama is a sideshow. The real fight is over what impartiality means – and who gets to decide.For traditional journalists, it means a balance of verifiable fact and sourced evidence. For the populist right, it meansFox News-style“both-sidesism”. They sneer that the BBC is biased, bureaucratic and past its prime. Yet its critics offer only a marketplace of billionaires’ agendas and algorithmic indignation. In that framing, the BBC’s safe and steady approach looks less like complacency than necessity.The BBC’sincomehas been cut by more than 30% in a decade. Despite this, it provides unrivalled value for money – notably breaking viewing records with its successful showThe Celebrity Traitors. Yet there is still no clear government commitment to maintaining the licence fee. There should be – and it is a pledge that ministers ought to be making soon. Labour’srefusalto confirm that the licence fee is secure after 2027 only invites commercial lobbying from the BBC’s rivals to push for a “mixed” funding model. Once the licence fee is gone, Auntie stops being a public good and becomes a market player. It would be the end of the BBC as we know it.Mr Trump’sthreatenedbillion-dollar lawsuit thus lands at the worst possible moment: the BBC is leaderless, its board inexperienced in crisis management and its rightwing opponents cock-a-hoop at the scalps they have taken. The BBC board knows little ofmodern journalism, yet entrusts editorial oversight toTory Sir Robbie Gibb– hardly neutral on UK politics or Israel. With legal threats, Mr Trump exports his “fake news” crusade, aiming to cow the globally respected BBC as he has America’s press.Rather than remaining silent to avoid offending the White House,Sir Keir Starmershould stand up for the BBC’s editorial freedom. He ought to recognise media independence and sovereignty over the infosphere as a national security issue. Doing nothing will only encourage Mr Trump and his UK allies to do their worst. The Panorama edit may be a mistake. The campaign around it is not. It is an assault on democratic infrastructure. The question is whether Britain will defend its power to tell the truth.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This was the calculation behind the government’s decision to put off until next year its plans for reform in a vitally important and sensitive area. Some council leaders were disappointed by the delay, such is their desperation about overspends. But ministers hope thatfurther consultationwill enable them to gather support for proposals that they insist are aimed at improving the system by making mainstream schools more inclusive – and not, as many families fear, reducing entitlements and saving money.The postponement was probably prudent. But as details oflast week’s Francis reviewon the curriculum sink in, it is clear that the government has work to do in maintaining a sense of momentum around its plans for education. The changes to GCSE content and exams set out in the report, which were mostly accepted by Bridget Phillipson, will take effect from 2029, which is after the next general election. Pupils who are currently in their last year of primary school (aged 10 and 11) will be the first to take the refreshed courses. Changes to the national curriculum will take effect a year earlier.Surely some of the proposed changes could be introduced sooner.Curriculumscannot be rewritten overnight, and should not be rushed. After detailed work in individual subject areas, a separate task involves joining them up to give teachers a clearer view of the whole. The review panel was rightly mindful of issues around teacher morale and workload. This was part of the reasoning behind its gradualist approach as well as its timeline.But might exam boards be able totrim exam timingsbefore qualifications are relaunched? Could agreater focus on oracy(or speaking skills), alongside reading and listening, be tried out in some classrooms straight away? This could be a way of increasing teachers’ professional autonomy, as the review also recommends, and thus giving a boost to recruitment and retention.Ministers should encourage schools that are keen to try new things. While a stronger focus on media literacy in the curriculum is welcome, there is no reason why teachers should wait three years. The pace of technological change and the blizzard of online material to which children are now exposed makes finding ways to address this in classrooms a pressing issue.Inside government, one priority must be the new, modular qualifications in maths and English. New “V-levels” also need fleshing out. Withalmost 1 million peopleaged 16-24 outside education, employment or training, the obstacles to participation for this group require urgent attention.There are some important issues that the review did not touch. Some experts believeA-levels are too narrow; others want to reduce primary schools’ reliance on phonics to teach reading. But taking a step back, the bigger question is why Labour did not develop more ambitious plans for schools during 14 years in opposition. Ms Phillipson is an able education secretary and policies including breakfast clubs, and the expansion of early years education, are among this government’s most significant achievements. But more of the groundwork for the kind of changes that the government is now trying to make ought to have been done before last year’s election.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromBrian Keegan,Fawzi IbrahimandNick FloyerMon 10 Nov 2025 13.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 13.07 ESTShareMartin Kettle highlights the political importance of the upcoming budget and the difficulties facing Rachel Reeves as the Labour government considers the prospect of having to increase income tax (Rachel Reeves is damned if she raises income tax in the budget – and damned if she doesn’t, 6 November).If Labour gets punished at the next election, it may not be because of a single broken electoral promise; it will more likely be because the electorate does not trust that there is a coherent, effective plan for governing.I’m not convinced that in the UK we have any greater tendency to “possessive individualism” today, despite Thatcher’s declaration in 1987 that “there is no such thing as society”. That said, I’m sure many would accept the need to contribute more to the collective good if the government was clearer about its plans, demonstrated a willingness to stick to the task in hand, and adopted a more considered approach to the allocation of public money.In terms of mitigating the fallout from tax rises, it’s possible that the government might receive a better response if it were to focus more on clarity of purpose and the collective benefits of well-funded public services, rather than relying on divisivecatchphrasessuch as, “those with the broadest shoulders should pay their fair share”.Prof Stephen CaddickWorthing, West SussexMartin Kettle fails to mention two other long-lasting impacts of Thatcherism. During my time as deputy leader of the Labour group at Cambridgeshire county council, from 1985 to 1989, we faced an attack on local government, a punitive approach to local decision-making and, in the end, the removal of autonomy over setting the business rate. For every extra £1 we wished to spend, we were “fined” £3 in lost grant, so had to raise the rates by £4 to spend an extra £1.Second, the privatisation of directly provided services, which moved a whole generation of public servants committed to serving the common good into the private sector to be “wealth creating” entrepreneurs.I was fortunate to work alongside a development corporation committed to serving the common good, which, between 1970 and 1988, built 26,306 houses, of which 15,312 (58%), were social housing.Brian KeeganPeterboroughThe media obsession with Labour preparing to “break manifesto promises” is infantile (Rachel Reeves refuses to rule out tax rises as autumn budget looms, 4 November). It is contemptuous of the voting public, much like a five-year-old who screams “but you promised” when their mum, having promised to take the child to the park, decided not to because it started to rain. The government should be commended for being flexible enough to change course, if only to mitigate the upheavals brought about by the current US administration.Fawzi IbrahimLondonIf the chancellor wants to reduce household energy bills for the less well off (Reeves considers cut to green levies in effort to reduce cost of energy bills, 4 November), there is a simple way to do it. Abolish daily standing charges and bundle infrastructure costs into the usage charges. Then those who economise by using little or no energy will pay less, average users will pay much the same, and lavish users will pay just a small percentage more.Nick FloyerChiswick, LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The area has a large proportion of working‑class communities that value technical education, but the national curriculum makes little provision for this. Investment in technical education from an early age would equip these young people with the skills that would attract employers to the area.Kartar UppalSutton Coldfield, West MidlandsIn response to Bill Onwusah’s winter fuel payment query (Letters, 6 November), the Department for Work and Pensions calculates it based on your circumstances in the “qualifying week”, principally your age in September this year and if you were living in England or Wales, whereas your actual entitlement to the payment depends on your income in the 2025-26 tax year, which HMRC won’t know until April next year at the earliest.Godfrey KellerDepartment of economics,University of OxfordRegarding the issue of changing the name of Epstein Road in Thamesmead (Letters, 7 November), this could be solved by adding “Jacob” to the beginning.

It was the first, terrible days following Augusto Pinochet’s coup in Chile in 1973. All over Santiago, desperate fugitives were scaling foreign embassy walls to find sanctuary from the death squads. But the British embassy, almost alone,refused to take them in. The ambassador was thrilled with the putsch. He told assembled British journalists: “Our business chaps here have been having a really difficult time, you know.”Nevertheless, they had managed to sell British fighter jets to Pinochet’s forces that led the attack on President Salvador Allende’s offices. The ambassador’s wife added brightly: “It was so marvellous to see our Hawker Hunters circling up there.”The rest of us sat there in stunned silence. But then Richard stood up. The walls seemed to bulge as his rage, shame and accusation blasted out, at the ambassador personally and at what appeared to be British policy. It lasted a long time. When Richard finished, His Excellency was very pale and the faces of his staff were rigid with hatred. Outside, the slaughter went on. But Richard had at least indelibly marked one of the lowest points to which British postwar diplomacy ever sank.Neal AschersonLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

As an employer, I regularly find comprehension of how PAYE, national insurance, tax codes and student loans are calculated is minimal. An understanding of what P6, P9, P60, P45 and P85 forms are for would help students transition into the world of employment.William AlexanderSevenoaks, KentUnlike Liz Thompson(Letters, 6 November), I went to a girls’ secondary modern school. We had a domestic science teacher, but not a science teacher. We were told: “You will end up sticking eyes in bendy toys.” I trained as a shorthand typist, studied for A-levels and a diploma in evening classes, and graduated from university aged 31. I didn’t get a “rich husband”, but did achieve a PGCE. Teaching would have been a “good job” if it hadn’t been for Margaret Thatcher’s school budgets policy, which resulted in privatisation of supply work and lower pay. I can still cook though.Janette WardTarrington, HerefordshireAt my secondary modern school in the 1950s, girls and boys shared most curriculum subjects, albeit with some noticeable exceptions: the girls did home economics and French, whereas the boys did technical drawing and algebra. It was explained to us that we boys needed algebra because we would be engineers and it would help us in the construction of bridges.Phil RhodenLow Habberley,WorcestershireI entered a grammar school in 1959.

The decision is massively subjective, in my opinion, but not a clear and obvious error.Starting from the top: the ball is in the back of the netafter Virgil van Dijk’s header from a corner, and the assistant referee, Stuart Burt, flags for offside. The offside player isAndy Robertson, who is in the goal area. When the ball is headed by Van Dijk, Robertson is standing almost in front of the goalkeeper. He then shifts to his left, shifts forward and, with the ball about to strike him, he ducks out of the way and the ball ends up in the net.After hundreds of millions spent on players, what was Liverpool’s plan?Read moreThe goal is disallowed on field, because the flag went up, but as we know when goals are scored they are automatically checked by VAR.To be in an offside position is not an offence in itself; it only matters when you become involved in active play. Robertson was penalised because he was deemed to have made an obvious action that impacted the ability of an opponent, in this case Gianluigi Donnarumma, to play the ball. You can’t say for sure whether Donnarumma would have got the ball and for the video assistant referee, Michael Oliver, to overturn the on-field call he has to have clear evidence that Donnaruma wasnotimpacted. For a VAR intervention you need clear evidence to overturn a decision and there wasn’t any.It would work the other way round, too. If we had seen an on‑field decision of a goal, had we not had an offside offence indicated, then VAR would also not have intervened. It would have been check complete and the goal would have stood. On balance, I would have preferred a goal, but it was not a clear and obvious error to deny one.After the match Arne Slot expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, which he is entitled to do. He mentioned that it had taken 13 seconds for the assistant to raise his flag and said that must have shown there was communication with the referee, perhaps highlighting that this was not a clear decision. The referee and their assistants are in communication with each other constantly. Quite clearly the assistant has a side‑on view, he identifies the offside position, and the referee has a front-on view where he can see if the player in question is committing an offence by impacting an opponent. They are in communication and sometimes decisions take a little bit longer, but there’s nothing untoward about that.View image in fullscreenAndy Robertson (left) remonstrates with the referee, Chris Kavanagh.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe VAR protocol is very straightforward: the on-field officials have to make a decision. You have to referee incidents and what VAR is not looking to do is to re-referee them, to break them down into their component parts, because there’s so much going on there. This is a decision that doesn’t warrant unpicking. It’s one that you just leave on the field.It’s clear the incident has frustrated some people and there have been comparisons to previous events. Last season, for example,Manchester Citywere awarded a goal against Wolves, despite Bernardo Silva being in an offside position, because he was adjudged not to be impacting other players. But no two incidents are the same and in the Silva situation there is a significant difference, namely he is clearly to the side of the goalkeeper, several metres from the flight of the ball and doesn’t duck under the ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The attacking midfielder started as Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, a result which left them eighth in the table.Nagelsmann has called for patience with the Germany international, however. \"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo,\" he said. \"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\"If you look at the game against City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes. So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal. You see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"\"We all know what he's capable of and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form,\" Nagelsmann added. \"We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\"\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates. That would be one idea, because ... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"Wirtz is part of Nagelsmann's squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia. Victories in both matches will secure Germany's place at the 2026 World Cup finals.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best course of action as we move through the season is to continue to educate as many people as we can in relation to the VAR protocol, in particular with relation to offside. Everybody’s got an opinion on the game; I’ve been to the supermarket and people have stopped me to ask whether I think situations are clear and obvious errors. But when I do speak to fans about how the protocol works, the stock answer I get is: “I didn’t know that.”The protocol is there for all to read and I think sometimes the more education we can get out there, the better it will be. It can help not just pundits but fans so that everyone’s got a better idea. As always, communication is key.Chris Foy is a former Premier League referee.Explore more on these topicsRefereesLiverpoolManchester CityLaws of footballcommentShareReuse this content"

He was replaced after 70 minutes ofthe 38-18 win against Fiji on ­Saturdayand in the likely event he is ruled out Maro Itoje’s expected second‑row partner would be Alex Coles.It would be dereliction of Borthwick’s duty not to harness Arundell’s raw talent | Gerard MeagherRead moreFreeman was also replaced in the later stages of the victory and it is understood he is nursing a hamstring injury. The 24-year-old has become an integral part of England’s back-line, starting at outside-centreagainst Australiabefore moving back to the right wing against Fiji.He has started all ­England matches he has been available for since the start of 2024 and his absence would be a considerable blow.Elliot Daly has returned to full training, but has not played sincehe fractured an armwhen with the Lions in June and it would be a huge call to throw him straight back into action against New Zealand. ­Freddie ­Steward (hand) and Tom Roebuck (ankle) missed out against Fiji, but have returned to training. If they are not available, England would be ­facing a back-three crisis.Steward started against Australia and would appear to be in ­competition with Daly for the No 15 jersey if Steve Borthwick does not keep Marcus Smith at full-back. If Roebuck is fit he would be the expected ­replacement for Freeman.Borthwick did reveal that Freeman was back under consideration to start in the No 13 jersey against New ­Zealand, but Ollie Lawrence would ­probably remain at outside­-centre if the ­Northampton Saint is unavailable.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman flies down the wing against Fiji.

He missed all of the autumn ­campaign last year after a knee injury at ­England’s preparation camp in Girona and nearly missed out on the 2023 World Cup because of an ankle injury in the Six Nations that year.Borthwick is not blessed with a wealth of second-row options and if Itoje and Coles are named to start on Saturday ­Chandler ­Cunningham-South would be pressed into providing cover. He started at No 8 against Fiji, but ­Borthwick is expected to reshuffle his back row  with Sam Underhill coming back in the fold.The 29-year-old destructive tackler sat out the victory against Fiji but has started 13 of England’s matches since the 2023 World Cup and is rarely omitted if fit.

But football’s governing body, Fifa, does allow athletes with a DSD to compete in the women’s game.However, the majority of insiders expect that Coventry’s campaign pledge will mean any athlete who has gone through male puberty will be banned from the female category.Speculation that the IOC would introduce a new policy as soon as January intensified on Monday after it was reported that its director of health, medicine and science, Dr Jane Thornton, had given a science-based review of the evidence to its members last week, showing there were permanent physical advantages to being born male.Thornton, a former Canadian rower, also explained how some sports bodies, such as World Athletics, were now using the SRY cheek-swab gene test to determine the biological sex of athletes in what was said by one source to be “a factual and dispassionate presentation”.The IOC, however, quickly denied any decision had been made. It is also understood that its working group on the issue is still continuing its deliberations, and the summer of 2026 is a more realistic timeframe for the new policy.Yet while the IOC is set on bringing in a new policy, much remains unclear. Will it follow the lead of World Athletics, with its cheek‑swab test? And can it ensure that any new policy does not face a legal challenge?A statement from the IOC read: “An update was given by the IOC’s director of health, medicine and science to the IOC members last week during the IOC commission meetings. The working group is continuing its discussions on this topic and no decisions have been taken yet. Further information will be provided in due course.”Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesWorld AthleticsTransgenderSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The flip between the dream of driving for this amazing team and then the nightmare of the results that we’ve had.”Elkann, who was instrumental in persuading Hamilton to join Ferrari and with whom the British driver is friends, gave an equally forthright response, speaking in Milan. “They should focus on driving and talk less,” he said of his two drivers. “We still have a few races left, and it’s not impossible to finish second.” Hamilton is sixth in the drivers’ championship, 66 points behind his teammateCharles Leclercand still without a podium finish. Leclerc was also knocked out of the race at Interlagos through no fault of his own when Kimi Antonelli crashed into him, dropping the Scuderia from second to fourth in the constructors’ championship.Hamilton had to retire after he took floor damage in a misjudged attempt to pass the Alpine of Franco Colapinto, for which he was later given a five-second penalty. Elkann intimated he expected better.“InFormula One, on the one hand, we have the mechanics who did their job, including poles and pit stops,” he said. “The engineers did the same, with the car clearly improving. The rest wasn’t up to par.”Hamilton and the team are already looking towards 2026, when new regulations offer a chance for a reset and he will have had a full season of acclimatisation. He has been active in pursuing change within Ferrari. It is believed he was somewhat taken aback at the team’s organisation and methodologies when he began working with them and that he felt the decision-making process was ungainly.In Belgium this year he revealed he had held a series of meetings with the key players at Ferrari including Elkann and the chief executive, Benedetto Vigna, and gone as far as compiling two documents detailing suggestions for the progress he believes is needed to turn around their fortunes.Meanwhile,Lando Norris, who won in Brazil, has pointedly played down expectations he is poised to secure his first F1 world championship after taking a commanding lead in the title race, warning he had a long way to go.View image in fullscreenLando Norris enjoys the taste of victory after winning in São Paulo.Photograph: DiaEsportivo/Action Plus/ShutterstockNorris won with a commanding drive from pole at Interlagos while his title rival andMcLarenteammate Oscar Piastri could manage only fifth. Max Verstappen delivered a magnificent performance to come back from 19th to third but his heroics only limited the damage to his title hopes as Norris opened a clear gap on his two competitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He could afford to finish second to Piastri in all three races and the sprint in Qatar and still seal the title. But he maintained he did not believe the last two races had been a turning point in the championship.“No, it just feels like another weekend where I came here to try and win, to get the most points I could and did that,” he said. “I also did that last weekend. Neither are turning points, they’re just strong results, which is exactly what I need, exactly what I’m fighting for every single weekend.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025FerrariLewis HamiltonCharles LeclercLando NorrisMcLarenFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

Beyond that, the Swan River flowed. Galahs, chests as pink as those any number of Englishmen will be sporting in a couple of weeks’ time, snuffled on the grass. Other birds flitted around the park, even those with less eye‑catching plumage sporting eye‑catching names: black-faced cuckooshrikes; willie wagtails. Um, ducks.Given that they visited Wellington’s Basin Reserve, Christchurch’s Hagley Oval andthe Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui at various stages during their white-ball tour of New Zealand, it is tempting to conclude that England have arranged their various stopping points of the winter on aesthetic rather than sporting grounds. Even in this company, though, Lilac Hill stands tall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You could say it looks good enough to eat, which is what the sprawling city of Perth appears to be doing to it.The first members of England’s Test squad arrived in Western Australia more than a week ago but it was not until Sunday evening that the last of them turned up. Multi-format players had been given a week off between tours, which many of them spent on a golfing tour of New Zealand, starting near the bottom of the South Island and working their way gradually north before finally ending up at Auckland airport. Monday, then, was the first opportunity for all 16 England players to train together, the morning when the Ashes starting pistol truly fired. On your marks, get set, go … somewhere else.Only five players turned up, heavily outnumbered by coaches and support staff. It was, to be fair, an optional session. Jofra Archer bowled off a full run-up, his first appearance at the ground even though he was one of the first players to arrive in the city and training sessions have been running all week. Joe Root, one of the late arrivals from New Zealand, and Jamie Smith, who also landed on Sunday after a family holiday in Dubai, did an extended session in the nets, facing mainly spin bowling. Shoaib Bashir provided some of it, along with a few local players (at the end of the session one of them said he had been underwhelmed by the experience, observing that “they’re not even that good”).View image in fullscreenThe West Australian newspaper’s front page on Monday took aim at Joe Root’s record in Australia as the world’s top-ranked Test batter  arrived in Perth.Photograph: The West AustralianThey were watched by occasional passing dog-walkers and a scant handful of vaguely interested locals. One of them, Jack Binn, sat under a tree, drinking a can of Coke, after pausing his bike ride at the sight of some unusual action. “I wouldn’t have thought England would be in a place like this,” he said. “I wouldn’t have a clue who’s in their team, I don’t even follow cricket. It’s just a good ride, coming out this way. I’m all about football, me. Never played the game, either. I actually think it’s a boring sport, to be honest with you.”For all his lack of expertise, Binn seemed encouraged by what he saw. “I can’t stand the stuck-up Aussie bastards,” he said. “I can’t stand their captain either. I hate people who are full of themselves. And they’re old – these guys look young and vibrant.”A couple of others stood a few yards away. One of them, Paul Gallizzi, is at least a cricket fan, and will be working one of the bars at the Optus Stadium during the first Test, but he came to get Ben Stokes’s autograph and left when informed his target had stayed away. The other, Lachlan Croot, had not known the team was here and was innocently driving past when he spied them and stopped. “I thought I’m probably not going to get another chance to do this,” he said. “I’ve seen all the Ashes talk. It’ll be interesting to see who walks the walk.”There is little excuse for anyone in the area not knowing that England are in town. After all, having last week described Stokes as “England’s cocky captain complainer”, on Monday the West Australian again devoted the majority ofits front pageto a picture of an English cricketer wheeling his luggage through Perth airport.Over an image of Root pushing some garishly floral bags through the arrivals hall its headline reimagined the world’s top-ranked Test batter as “average Joe”. “Dud Root down under: hero in the homeland, pretender in Australia,” it wrote, encouraging readers to turn to page nine for “the stats that haunt England’s greatest batter”. In the pre-series phoney war much is being made of Root’s disappointing record in Australia, but as a scant assortment of onlookers and dog-walkers can now attest, he seems to be working hard to improve it.Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketEngland cricket teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tygart said that Wada’s intervention was a “desperate attempt to divert attention” from its role in theChinese swimming scandal of 2021.Enhanced Games are dangerous and must be stopped, says Wada headRead more“For an organisation reportedly part of a criminal investigation by US law enforcement, the continued and blatantly false attacks from Wada president [Witold] Banka are a telling smokescreen,” Tygart said. “His attempts to smear America and our US Olympic and professional athletes is a desperate attempt to divert attention away from his failure in allowing China to sweep 23 positive tests under the carpet. Those who value clean and fair sport should stand up and demand that Wada be fixed.”Tygart said a failure to stop the Chinese swimmers who failed drug tests from competing in the Tokyo Games, had allowed “certain athletes to … have their own Enhanced Games”.Wada and Usada havebeen at odds over the Chinese swimming scandalsince details were revealed by reporting last year. An independent review into the affair later criticised Wada’s “disorganisation” but cleared it of bias. In January, however, it emerged that the US government had defaulted on $3.6m of funding for the global body, with Tygart commenting at the time that “Usada fully supports this decision by the United States [government] as the only right choice to protect athletes’ rights and fair competition”.Tygart said the Enhanced Games had “nothing” to do with US enforcement. “We are working closely with our partners Fifa and the ITA to ensure this summer’s World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games are the cleanest on record, and not a repeat of the 2021 and 2024 Games where certain athletes with positive tests were allowed to compete, win, and in a way have their own Enhanced Games,” he said. “The Enhanced Games have nothing to do with our athletes, the World Cup, or the Olympics, and President Banka knows this.”A Wada spokesperson said the staging of the Enhanced Games on US soil was “an embarrassment” for Tygart, adding: “It should surprise no one that Wada – with the support of clean athletes all over the world – has taken a strong and vocal position against the Enhanced Games. It seems incongruous, therefore, that Usada refuses to work with the global anti‑doping community to unite against it.”Explore more on these topicsWadaUsada (United States Anti-Doping Agency)Drugs in sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It remains to be seen whether the Canadian, whose place in Turin was only confirmed on Sunday, will be fit to play his remaining two group games.“It was very tough until 6-5 and then he had a physical issue,” said Sinner, who won the title here last year without dropping a set. “It’s a special tournament and place for me,” he added as fans chanted his name during the post-match interview.On his opponent’s injury, Sinner said: “I hope it’s not too serious and wish him a speedy recovery and he gets back to 100% physically.

This time next week, with the showpiece event still four months away, five will be in the form book. It is, on the face of it, rather a waste of a magnificent racecourse (or two racecourses, since the New course takes over from the Old after the final afternoon of the November meeting on Sunday).But the paucity of racing at the home of jumping is, to some extent, the point. Cheltenham racing is National Hunt’s most precious resource and an increase in the supply would debase the currency. It would also diminish the anticipation for the three-day meeting that has attracted nearly 400 entries.Newmarket horse owner receives notice of complaint over ‘constant neighing’Read moreThis meeting is in rude health on both sides of the running rail. Theabrupt decline in attendanceat the festival has been well-documented, but Cheltenham’s second-best meeting has reversed the trend since a one-off post-Covid boom in the 2021-22 season. Like the festival attendance, the total crowd for the November meeting dropped the following season. Unlike the festival, however, where the decline has continued, the November crowd has edged back up in the past two years.It can only be a positive sign for the track’s management team as they set out to address their festival problem. Cheltenham in general retains its appeal to the fans, even if some of them have – hopefully temporarily – fallen out of love with the festival-going experience. If the festival-specific issues can be identified and addressed the track’s showpiece event should regain its appeal.For owners and trainers, the pre-festival meetings are an invaluable chance to give their best prospects vital experience on the uniquely demanding track where 28 horses will become festival winners next spring.Three of last season’s festival winners – Wodhooh, Jagwar and Stumptown – were last-time-out winners at Cheltenham. Five more ran on the penultimate start before the festival, including Haiti Couleurs and Jango Baie, both of whom won at the December meeting. There could be a festival winner lurking in the field for any of the 19 races.View image in fullscreenThe popular Jonbon will race on the opening day of Cheltenham’s November meeting.Photograph: Steven Cargill/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockWhile there are no Grade One events at this – or any other – pre-festival meeting, there will be past, and probably future, Grade One winners in action, starting withthe ever-popular Jonbonin Friday’s Shloer Chase.James Owen, whose growing strength on the flat and over jumps is one of the stories of 2025, has won the opening juvenile hurdle on Saturday’s card the past two seasons. It will be fascinating to see which of his three entries gets the nod to attempt to follow Burdett Road – last year’s Champion Hurdle runner-up – and East India Dock, who went on to be beaten less than a length in the Triumph Hurdle having set off as the 5-4 favourite.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has been staged under many banners since Mackeson – an alcohol brand so ancient it was once marketed as a drink that could be good for your health – dropped its sponsorship after 35 years in 1995.Its status as the first big handicap chase of the winter campaign has never been in doubt, however, and this year’s running of the Paddy Power Gold Cup will be the only race on many minds on Saturday morning. The memory of many winners tends to fade with time, but most punters of a certain age, I suspect, would be able to glance down the list of this race’s winners and recall which ones they were on.In theory, the 2025-26 jumps season started in early May, For practical and, perhaps more importantly, spiritual purposes, it will begin when the field sets off for the conditional jockeys’ handicap hurdle at 1.10pm on Friday. Every rare afternoon of action below Cleeve Hill will be one to anticipate and cherish.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesHorse racing tipsCheltenhamCheltenham festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both Renée Slegers and Sonia Bompastor said afterwards that they think theintroduction of video assistant refereeswould be a positive step in helping eliminate the most obvious of errors, such as Blackstenius’s goal being ruled out for a nonexistent handball, and in assisting with the more marginal calls: whether Alessia Russo was offside for her goal or Frida Maanum was offside when her effort was ruled out.The reality is that while there has been a big push to improve the standard of officiating in the Women’s Super League – there is investment in coaching and support around officials and steps are being taken to ensure as many as possible can operate as full-time professionals – refereeing is still playing catchup. VAR brings problems of its own but if technology can lift the pressure on referees in the WSL and help ensure they get the majority of big decisions right then it feels like a no-brainer. It’s a potentially costly endeavour, but if the WSL wants the focus to be on the football in a fixture that, as Bompastor put it, “is one of the most beautiful in the world”, then they need to ensure the controversies are at a minimum, for the sake of the game and the referees.Suzanne Wrack‘We need justice’: Slegers calls for VAR after officials deny ArsenalRusso earns draw with Chelsea but Arsenal rue decisionsShaw shows class in sending City topBy Bunny Shaw’s extremely high standards, it has felt like a slow start to the season for last year’s WSL Golden Boot winner. However, with her goal against Everton on Sunday – a trademark bullet header to make the score 2-1 – she proved once again just how important she is to Manchester City. It should not come as a surprise when you dig into the data. Shaw has the highest expected goals in the league by some margin (5.8), has produced the greatest number of shots (33) and won the most aerial duels (also 33). City could have easily slipped up against the indefatigable Toffees but Andrée Jeglertz has added a new resilience since his arrival. Shaw put this down to “a mentality shift” within the group, one that now has them top for the first time this season.Sophie DowneyWSL roundup: City go top, Liverpool and West Ham stay winlessLionesses produce statement winTwo former Arsenal stars sunk Tottenham asLondon City Lionessesearned their first statement WSL victory. The top-flight debutants have enjoyed a steady start to the season, but Sunday marked their biggest win at this level. The former Arsenal academy graduate Freya Godfrey, who joined in the summer for an undisclosed fee, was player of the match, netting twice and providing an assist. Former Gunner Nikita Parris also got on the scoresheet – and looked thrilled about it as she passionately punched the air in celebration. It would be fair to say the red side of north London was particularly happy with the outcome – especially as it meant Spurs dropped below Arsenal in the table. “It was tough, it was a fight,” Godfrey said. “I think it was more of a fighting game than a tactical game. Sometimes you have those games in football and we had to be ready to adapt to it.”Emillia HawkinsLiverpool let points slip yet againLiverpool have a first point on the board after their 1-1 draw with Brighton but their failure to hold on to a lead continues to be a major concern amid a grim start to the season. Gareth Taylor’s side have now dropped 11 points from games in which they have scored first in their seven WSL fixtures this season. Against Brighton there were real signs of progress. Liverpool looked the slickest they have this term and Beata Olsson turned the ball in at the near post, her second goal in two games, to open the scoring. Fuka Nagano’s effort then forced the Brighton goalkeeper, Chiamaka Nnadozie, to push the ball on to the crossbar and Sam Kerr also hit the woodwork. They created chances, and every manager will point out that you can’t score if you aren’t creating chances, but Liverpool’s conversion rate has to improve to alleviate the pressure a one-goal margin ensures. The concession of the equaliser in the 93rd minute was a cruel blow, but it was one of their own making, again.SWskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

West Ham were on course for their first win of the season only for Leicester’s Shannon O’Brien to equalise in the 97th minute. “Everyone’s trying really hard to get the result,” the West Ham manager said. “The determination, desire and work-rate in training has been phenomenal … That’s a massive credit to the desire and intent of the side.” There are certainly positives she can take. Her team controlled proceedings for the most part. Once again, however, they were made to pay for their wastefulness in front of goal and had only one shot on target. That lack of quality in end product is the most worrying trend and poses the ultimate question about the mentality of players who get themselves in good positions but are unable to find the back of the net. It is a conundrum that needs to be solved.SDArroyo looks up, not down, for VillaNatalia Arroyo is hopeful that Aston Villa’s win over Manchester United will spur the team on for the rest of the season. Before Saturday’s match she said Villa wanted to “be a problem for the bigger teams” in the league. They certainly achieved that against in-form United away from home. The visitors were clinical when they needed to be while remaining defensively robust to keep a clean sheet and win 1-0. In fact, they could have easily scored a few more in the second half. “We know that for these types of games probably no one expects us to win,” Arroyo said afterwards. “So if we can take something, the point at the Emirates and these three here at United, that allows us to believe and dream bigger.”EHPosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women811212Chelsea Women811203Man Utd Women813174Arsenal Women810155Tottenham Hotspur Women8-1156London City Lionesses8-7127Aston Villa Women71108Brighton & Hove Albion Women8089Leicester Women8-8610Everton Women8-5511Liverpool FC Women7-9112West Ham Women8-161Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballArsenal WomenChelsea WomenManchester City WomenManchester United WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Azerbaijan, once mooted as a contributor, did not attend a planning meeting in Turkey last week and said it would not contribute unless a full ceasefire was in place.The UAE’s decision, announced by the senior envoy Dr Anwar Gargash at a conference in Abu Dhabi, reflects Arab doubts about the terms of a US-drafted resolution already distributed to diplomats at the UN in New York. The draft places an onus on a US-directed stabilisation force to be the principal means of imposing security inGazaafter Israel has left the territory.Unrwa has the capacity and expertise to support a postwar Gaza. We want to help make this peace work | Philippe LazzariniRead moreGargash said: “The UAE does not yet see a clear framework for the stability force and under such circumstances will not participate, but will support all political efforts towards peace – and remain at the forefront of humanitarian aid.”The Arab states would like greater responsibilities to be given to a separate Palestinian civilian police force. International law would also forbid foreign troops from entering occupiedPalestineunless there was explicit Palestinian consent, otherwise the force would be seen as coercive under UN law, and arguably stabilising an unlawful Israeli occupation.Jamal Nusseibeh, a Palestinian American co-author of the Palestinian armistice plan, said: “It is critical that the force be deployed not to stabilise the unlawful Israeli occupation, but to enforce international law and end it. The force will work as long as it enters the entire occupied territory, including theWest Bank, at the request of Palestine, and has a clear objective to end the occupation within the context of a sovereign Palestinian state.”There is no reference to the West Bank in the US draft resolution, or to a Palestinian state, or a two-state solution, a prospect Israel opposes.Detailed negotiations on the stabilisation force mandate, including its command and control, started formally on Thursday in New York, and look likely to be protracted – risking the development of a vacuum in Gaza that may strengthen Hamas.The US is proposing that it lead the force although it will not have many troops involved on the ground. It has already in effect taken control of the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza from a new civil military coordination centre based in Israel.The draft US resolution defines the purpose of a stabilisation force as “along with the newly trained and vetted police force to help secure border areas, stabilise the security environment in Gaza by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding the military terror and offensive infrastructure as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”.The force, answerable to a “board of peace” chaired by Donald Trump, and not to the UN, would be required to use “all necessary measures” to achieve its objectives.Arab states including Qatar are also concerned that this mandate is too expansive, and if Hamas is to disarm that the group will only do so to fellow Palestinians, probably in the civilian police force, at a moment that, from the Hamas perspective, marks the end of occupation.They also fear the draft mandate spills into giving the stabilisation force a governance role in Gaza, a task that was to be set aside for a Palestinian technocratic committee working in conjunction with a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA).This “transitional governance administration” in Gaza would remain until “the Palestinian Authority has satisfactorily completed its reform programme, the satisfaction of which shall be acceptable to the BoP [board of peace]”, the draft says. It also “underscores the importance” of full humanitarian aid in Gaza, including through the UN, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Red Crescent.However, it opens the door to the exclusion of “any organisation found to have misused such aid”. The phrase leaves open the board of peace excluding Unrwa, the body that the international court of justice has said is the lawful distributor of aid.France andSaudi Arabiaare already pressing for a reference to a Palestinian state to be included in the resolution. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is due in the White House on 18 November, and Manal Radwan, from Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry, has said a reference to a Palestinian state is a prerequisite.The PA chair, Mahmoud Abbas, met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on Monday to discuss the PA role.Neither the UN nor the 15-strong security council are given a supervisory role over the stabilisation force, overseeing the implementation of the resolution, a point largely overlooked by the draft text. Nothing is specified about the funding of this stabilisation mission, which, according to the Americans, should be largely borne by Gulf states, with Saudi Arabia taking the lead.Israel is seeking written guarantees from the US that it will be allowed to follow the pattern of Lebanon and reserve the right to re-enter Gaza if it believes disarmament is not taking place at the scale or pace it requires.The Israeli proposal was put to Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff. Kushner was in Jerusalem on Monday to discuss progress on the ceasefire and Witkoff was due to arrive later the same day.The bodies of four of the original 251 Israeli hostages remain unreturned.Separately, Israel has been proposing that Gaza could yet be split in two, with reconstruction work starting in the Israel-occupied parts of the strip. Western diplomats insist this is not part of the Trump plan.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestineUnited Arab EmiratesSaudi ArabiaIsraelUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Mordaunt said: “The situation took its toll on me. You’re constantly having to think about whether he was going to be in your workplace or on your street.”Robert Bryan, prosecuting, said Brandt faced an allegation of stalking involving severe harm or distress. Brandt denies the charge.Bryan said: “His victim is Penny Mordaunt, who was until 2024 the member of parliament for Portsmouth North and the leader of the House of Commons. He was a resident on the Isle of Wight and so was not a constituent of Penny Mordaunt.“Even though she is an MP, she is entitled to exactly the same legal protection as anyone else. MPs are vulnerable. Just look at Jo Cox or David Amess. Their baseline level of fear is higher than ordinary members of the public.”The prosecutor said that in the autumn of 2023 Brandt called and emailed Mordaunt’s office, asking her for a cup of tea and inquiring about her security arrangements. Bryan alleged Brandt emailed Mordaunt several times over the coming months asking to meet up.In November 2023 he also sent her a message relating to the Olympic diver Tom Daley, with whom Mordaunt had appeared on the television show Splash! in 2014.Bryan said in December 2023 Brandt tried to leap the barriers at her constituency office, which triggered the alarms. “Security rushed after him and asked him questions about what he was doing,” said Bryan. “This marked an escalation. She [Mordaunt] was in her office and was escorted back to her car.”Police were called and Brandt allegedly said he “just wanted to shake her hand”.He was told he should not contact her and said he understood, the court heard, but he emailed her again in March 2024 to wish her a happy birthday – apologising for being a day late and saying her rejections had “stiffened his resolve”.Bryan said that in May 2024 Brandt messaged again, saying: “I am just going to keep knocking on your door until you open it and let me shake your hand.”Giving evidence, Mordaunt said: “He made me feel very vulnerable and I had concerns for my own safety.“I was very disappointed that he hadn’t listened to the police warning. I thought his behaviour was inappropriate and it was very disappointing that it was continuing. I think he wanted a personal relationship with me.“It was becoming clear that all normal, reasonable requests that were being made were being ignored. I had had assessments with the police and the parliament security team.“We had to change the security in the constituency office and we had to change some of my normal routine, which was quite predictable, and I was told not to use public transport.“I had to change security in the office, hide signage to the office and change the locks so we had personal fobs to get in. I also had CCTV installed outside the office and me and my staff had personal alarms which we had not had before.”“References to my personal appearance just increased my view that he wanted a personal relationship with me.”The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

And though Schumer does not publicly support the compromise, lawmakers and Democrat-affiliated groups have turned on him, criticizing his leadership and calling for his ouster.“Last night, eight ‘moderate’ Democrats got played. Conned. Rooked. Pantsed. Pumped and dumped. Rode hard and put away wet,” Rick Wilson, the ex-Republican strategist and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, wrote in a piece titled “Schumer and the Hateful Eight Betray America”.“It was a colossal leadership failure, and Chuck Schumer should resign as minority leader immediately if he had a shred of honor or shame.”The sentiment is rife in progressive groups such as Our Revolution, whose executive director Joseph Geevarghese said: “Chuck Schumer should step down as Senate minority leader immediately. If he secretly backed this surrender and voted no to save face, he’s a liar. If he couldn’t keep his caucus in line, he’s inept. Either way, he’s proven incapable of leading the fight to prevent healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for millions of Americans.”In the House, three Democrats have so far called on Schumer to step aside, among them Mike Levin, who represents a swingy district on the southern California coast. “Chuck Schumer has not met this moment and Senate Democrats would be wise to move on from his leadership,” he wrote on X Monday.Fellow Californian Ro Khanna said, “Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” while Michigan representative andSquadmember Rashida Tlaib said the minority leader “has failed to meet this moment and is out of touch with the American people. The Democratic party needs leaders who fight and deliver for working people. Schumer should step down.”But none of the voices calling for a change in leadership belong to the Democratic senators who could force the issue. Nor did Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the party in the House of Representatives, join in. “Yes and yes,” he said at a Monday press conference, when a reporter asked if he believed Schumer was effective, and whether he should keep the leadership post he has held for eight years.A spokesman for Schumer did not respond to a request for comment.The squabble is in many ways a rehash of one that took place earlier this year, when the 74-year-old briefly found himself manning the barricades in a funding battle the ended up turning into a Democratic rout.The moment came three months into Donald Trump’s presidency and days before government funding was set to expire. House Republicans had sent the Senate a short-term funding measure that almost all Democrats in the lower chamber opposed.Faced with the prospect of swallowing the bill as is, or demanding changes and likely causing a shutdown, Schumerinitially went with the latter, beforechanging his mindand voting for the measure along with his caucus’s centrists. The decision broughta backlashfrom the party’s base, with liberal groups such as Indivisible and MoveOn calling for new leadership.Schumer survived, and when the latest funding battle began 41 days ago, his office collaborated with those same groups on their shutdown strategy. The Democrats held firm for weeks, even as an increasingly frustrated John Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, held 14 fruitless votes on GOP-authored legislation to reopen the government, without addressing the ACA subsidies.Over in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson put representatives on a lengthy recess to make clear to Senate Democrats that his party was not interested in negotiating over their demands.At the press conferences he convened regularly after funding lapsed, Johnson repeatedly alleged that the “Schumer shutdown” was driven by the minority leader’s desire not to face a primary challenge in 2028 from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York congresswoman who Republicans allege is shaping the party’s agenda.“He thinks AOC is going to challenge him or some other Marxist,” Johnson said in early October.The compromise to reopen the government authorizes funding through January, and promises Democrats a vote on extending the ACA tax credits, though there is no guarantee their bill would pass the Senate, or, if it does, come up for a vote in the House. Schumer’s fingerprints are not publicly on the deal, which was worked out by a group of moderate senators who have either recently won re-election or are in their final terms in office.“This healthcare crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [resolution] that fails to address the healthcare crisis,” he said after the deal was announced. He did not vote to advance the bill when it cleared an important procedural vote on Sunday night.By Monday afternoon, signs emerged that some Democrats did not like the tone of the debate over the bill. “As a reminder, the DCCC is currently targeting dozens of Republican-held districts across the country,” Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, wrote in a memo to House lawmakers.“We would like to encourage all of you to hold vulnerable Republicans in your state, region, and media market accountable when you’re doing earned and social media this week.” Translation: lay off Schumer.Whether the party’s base listens is another question.“Despite his no vote, the entire political world knows this is a direct result of Chuck Schumer’s leadership,”wroteIndivisible, as it encouraged the progressive group’s supporters to call Democratic senators and tell them to find a new leader.“He either blessed this surrender, or was incapable of leading his caucus to hold the line.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Chuck SchumerDemocratsTrump administrationUS SenateUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their financials, their physical scale, and the amount of information contained within are so massive that the idea of stopping their construction can seem like opposing an avalanche in progress.Despite the scale and momentum of the explosion of data centers, resistance is mountingin the United States,in the United Kingdom, and in Latin America, where data centers have been built in some of the world’s driest areas. Local opposition in all three regions has often focused on the environmental impacts and resource consumption of the gargantuan structures.Paz Peña is a researcher and fellow with the Mozilla Foundation who studies the social and environmental impact of technology, particularly data centers and particularly in Latin America. She spoke to the Guardian at the Mozilla festival in Barcelona about how communities in Latin America are going to court to pry information away from governments and corporations that would much rather keep it secret.The Guardian: Could you describe your research?Paz Peña: Basically, my research is about the positions of governments on data centers and what the promises are behind them. What are the relationships that governments today in Latin America have with big tech? There’s a lot of lobbying activities around infrastructure and data centers from big tech to governments in Latin America.Chile and Brazil are the two top countries working on data centers today in Latin America, and Chile is one of the countries in Latin America that has a lot of resistance against data centers.What the governments are doing – I’m talking about leftwing governments … what they are looking for is foreign investment for data centers in their countries. The amounts are great. It’s a public policy to attract [data centers] with what they call national investment plans. They’re doing tax exemptions, for example, in Brazil, which is a huge controversy back there.In the case of Chile, what they’re doing is actually trying to deregulate the environmental assessments that data centers are going through.Carving out an exception for them?Peña: Exactly. There’s no specific category of environmental impact assessment for data centers in Latin America. In the case of Chile right now, they are assessed on the diesel that they use, because they use diesel generators for energy. It’s huge amounts of diesel.The government actually made an administrative change in the environmental system evaluation, where the threshold that data centers need to achieve on diesel to pass an environmental assessment changed. Magically, that means that data centers are not going through environmental impact assessments in Chile any more, which was the reason why communities understood what were the impacts of data centers. They don’t have that information right now.What we’re seeing is that governments are creating opportunities for investments but not creating rules and regulations for the environmental impacts of data centers, rules about diesel use, energy, and water.Without that information on data centers, do you see that the opposition to them is confused orhobbled because they don’t know what it is they’re opposing? Or does it incite more opposition because of the feeling of not being told what’s really going on?In the case of Chile, I would say that the local activism is quite angry with the leftwing government. The promises of this government was to be an environmental, sustainable exercise of power, right? President [Gabriel] Boric actually said this, that he would form anecological government. Nobody really believes that. But they put that in the discourse. So you have to pay your words, right?People are really mad. I would say for two reasons. One is that they don’t have the transparency to understand what is going on in their neighborhoods. The second thing is they are super mad about it because the national data center plan, which is, again, a foreign investment plan, is presented for companies – but not necessarily for communities. When they actually publicly presented this plan, which was about two months ago, all the industry was present, but super few people from communities. Communities felt like they were being left out of the conversation.If there’s a data center planned for my neighborhood and I oppose it, what should I do?In a community, you will find people that understand what a data center is and some people will not have an idea of what it is. So when they have heard, they probably heard by two sources: a government’s evaluation system or the media. So once they have heard about this, the main problem they have is, again, transparency. Because corporate secrecy is still super present around the resources that these data centers need – energy, water, et cetera.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When a community asks for more information, the government is saying: it’s corporate secrecy. We cannot give you that information. So in general, what we are seeing is that communities are considering going to court to actually ask for that information. Because in Latin America, there is an inter-American agreement called the Escazu agreement, which is an environmental agreement about transparency, saying that a government cannot hide this incredibly important information for people.In the case of Uruguay, they went to court, because there was a Google data center being built in Uruguay in Montevideo, the capital. A couple of years ago, they’re going through an incredible drought where the people in Montevideo had to shower with buckets of water.Meanwhile, the government announced that this Google data center, where the amounts of water needed would be immense. So people were asking if this water, this very scarce resource, should be going to Google or to people. This is a fair question.They didn’t know exactly how much water Google would need. So they asked the government. The government said no. The environmental minister said: no, you cannot have that information because it’s corporate secrecy by Google. So they went to court, and they won, actually. The court quoted the Eskasu agreement.When a community takes a public stance saying we want more information about this and that, and social and environmental impacts, the impression is that they are opposing progress, technological progress, economic progress. Corporations, and I will say, sadly, governments – they see communities as a kind of roadblock.The first thing people need is information, and the first hurdle that they confront is the lack of information. So I would say that the first step they need to take is to find any source of information, and sometimes go to court. The majority of these actions are not successful, but they are sometimes the only way that corporations but also, sadly, governments give the information to the people.If you lose the fight, what should you do then if you’re a member of this community?For some communities in Chile that I interviewed, big tech companies weren’t actually the enemy, which is very interesting. Data center plans were seen as sort of an opportunity to raise the bar of environmental measures, because the people in those communities are surrounded by so many bad corporate actors who pollute a lot and don’t even care. It’s not necessarily a movement against big tech. Not yet, I would say. Maybe later.For now, these communities see a tech company planning a data center as not as a bad actor, actually as a strategic opportunity to raise the bar of environmental care and measures in their own neighborhoods. Big tech companies have this necessity of being the good player in the world, or at least being seen that way, so there is an opportunity for people to say, ‘Big tech has raised the bar of environmental care. So let’s try to put some sort of pressure to the other bad actors.’The enormous amounts of money and the physical scale of these things are so huge. They seem to operate on this inhumanly large level. How do people believe in their own opposition to these projects? They’re so massive that it kind of seems like you’re just saying no to an earthquake.In general, people who are working against data centers are people who have a background working on environmental issues. It’s people really used to the big fight. It’s people that really understand how difficult it is to deal with corporations and with governments.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingSilicon ValleynewsShareReuse this content"

At first, the tigers snatched guard dogs on the edge of villages in Russia’s far east, emerging from the forest at night to prey. Others went for livestock, going after horses and cattle.Then the attacks on people began. In January, an ice fisher was mauled at night and dragged away by a big cat, just weeks after a forester had been killed. In March, another man was attacked and partlyeaten by a tiger. It was the deadliest winter for tiger attacks in Siberia for decades.For years, the Amur tiger, also known as the Siberian tiger, was so rarely seen in Russia’s far east that it was considered a ghost of the forest. The world’s largest big cat, celebrated for its power and resilience, is also one of the most endangered. A few hundred cling on in a remote fragment of the Siberian taiga and a sliver of the Russian-Chinese border, remnants of a historic territory that once spanned the Korean peninsula and north-east China.View image in fullscreenA screenshot from a video taken at the scene of the tiger attack in March, when a man was partly eaten.Photograph: TelegramSince 2020, however, Amur tigers have left the forest in unprecedented numbers – sparking fear among the communities that live alongside them.African swine fever, a disease that is almost always fatal to most pig species, has swept through the region. The disease has been described by scientists as anecological disaster, driving a number ofwild pig species toward extinction, with enormousknock-on effects for ecosystemsand other species. It has killedvast numbers of wild boar, a main food source for the tigers and particularly popular with females with cubs.Ancient elephant migration routes are being blocked off – can anything stop the rising death toll?Read moreThe virus probably came over the border from China, where millions of pigs died after an outbreak that began in 2018. Unrestricted poaching of deer and increased logging in the tigers’ ranges have contributed to a perfect storm to push the predators out of their forests in search of food. Some regions have seen a 1,000%increase in human tiger-conflict incidentsas African swine fever has spread.In a typical year, a handful of tiger deaths and captures take place. Yet, between October 2024 and September this year, at least 17 Amur tigers have been killed and 27 captured, of which three later died, according to analysis seen by the Guardian. Of the captured cats, many were found emaciated and dehydrated, or suffering from the effects of gunshot wounds or trauma injuries from a vehicle collision.“The tigers are hungry. That is why we are seeing these incidents,” says an Amur tiger expert, whom the Guardian has not named to protect their identify. As tiger conservation has become increasingly politicised in Russia, some experts fear speaking publicly on the issue. “People want to highlight this to the government but they do not want to listen,” they say.View image in fullscreenThe Amur tiger is the world’s largest big cat, and one of the most endangered.Photograph: CTK/AlamyThere are no figures on the number of wild boar that have died fromAfrican swine feverin eastern Russia, although there are frequent reports from people who come across carcasses in the forest during mushroom and nut gathering trips. Dr Matthias Markolf, a researcher at Cologne zoo, is part of a group of international experts working to better understand the global impact of the virus on wild species.“Pigs die in 90-100% of circumstances. It’s really fatal. In Asia, there are lots of pig species restricted to small islands, so it’s having catastrophic consequences. We have already come across examples in Sumatra and Malaysia where they are having more tiger conflicts,” he says.View image in fullscreenAfrican swine fever is deadly and kills 90-100% of pigs it infects.Photograph: Sebastian Willnow/dpa/AFP/Getty ImagesSpeaking out about the recent human-tiger conflicts in the Russian far east can be dangerous; in 2008, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, threw his weight behind Amur tiger conservation efforts, pledging to increase numbers of the big cat. Officially, authorities say there are now about 750 in the wild, a significant increase from the 1940s, when numbers were as low as 40. While few trust the accuracy of official numbers, many expertssay the push from the Russian leader has helped. But many conservationists also suspect the big cats are in far more trouble than authorities recognise.View image in fullscreenA Russian sign reads: ‘Caution! Tigers nearby!’Photograph: Heather Paul/Getty ImagesThe Amur tiger centre, the main body responsible for their conservation, was established by Putin. The board for their conservation is overseen by justice minister Konstantin Chuychenko, who has been sanctioned by western countries over his role in the invasion of Ukraine. Karin Kneissl, former foreign minister for Austria anda close ally of Putin, is an international ambassador on tiger protection. Few independent researchers and conservation groups are allowed to work on the Amur tiger’s protection, experts say.At a recent event, Sergey Aramilev, the director general of the Amur tiger centre, played down concerns about issues with Amur tigers.“Human deaths in Amur tiger attacks are extremely rare. From 2010 to 2024, 20 attacks on humans were recorded, resulting in 13 injuries and seven deaths. Of these 20, 18 were provoked by humans,”he said. “Two recent cases in 2025 were consistent with the overall statistics; both tigers had multiple gunshot wounds. Therefore, the claim of unprovoked aggression by a tiger toward a human is far-fetched and exists only in unreliable online publications.”The Amur tiger centre did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.But some have chosen to raise the issue online, regardless of the risk. In January,residents in one villageused social media to complain about the impact of a tigress hunting dogs in their town. Othershave pledgedto boycott local elections until they get more protection from tigers.Experts working on the project say more must be done to protect the forests that are home to the tigers, including reducing the impact of logging and mining.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin (left), who established the Amur tiger centre, helps fix a satellite transmitter to a tiger in Ussurisky forest reserve on 31 August 2008.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images“If we keep the ecosystem, we keep the tigers.

The Brazilian hosts have a packed agenda, with 145 separate items on it, and decided to begin early, with a preliminary event called the Belém Climate Summit. World leaders were invited to this two-day event, held on Thursday 6 and Friday 7 November in Belém, to try to encourage their negotiating teams to shed entrenched positions and take bold actions at Cop itself.Q: What are NDC pledges and why have countries missed their deadlines?A: This year’s Cop comes at a key point in the cycle of the2015 Paris agreement, which fleshes out the “how” of the UNFCCC by requiring every country to come up with a national plan on greenhouse gas emissions. Called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), these plans must be revised every five years.Two cycles of NDCs – the first at Paris, the secondcompiled in 2021 at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow(which was delayed from 2020 by the Covid pandemic) – have now passed. In the first, nations put forward targets, mostly pegged to 2025, which would have allowed temperatures torise by more than 3C above preindustrial levels, far beyond the 1.5C that was the more stringent of the two targets in the Paris treaty.By Cop26, countries were doing slightly better – theirNDCs would have caused temperature rises of roughly 2.8C. Using the “ratchet” mechanism in the Paris agreement, which allows for the tightening of NDCs, countries were encouraged to come back to future Cops with more stringent plans. However, only a handful have ever done so outside the five-year cycle.This year’s crop of NDCs were supposed to be the ones to align with 1.5C, because scientists have warned repeatedly that emissions need to drop rapidly in the 2020s to stay within the crucial limit.The deadline for NDCs, according to the Paris provisions,should have been February. But few countries made it, and the UN made it known that the organisers would be happy if the plans were delivered before Cop30 instead.By the start of Cop30, most of the major countries had submitted their NDCs. But the picture was still grim. According to the UN, the assessed plans wouldcut greenhouse gas emissions by about 10% by 2035– nowhere near the 60% cuts needed by that date, to have a reasonable chance of staying within 1.5C. These NDCs would result in temperature rises of about 2.5C, if all the targets within them are fulfilled, or 2.8C if only those targets that have clear policy measures attached to them are counted.The task for Brazil, as Cop president, is to map out a clear pathway from Cop30 to the emissions cuts needed for a 1.5C world, showing how these inadequate NDCs can bebolstered by real-world actionsthat will substitute clean energy for fossil fuels.Q: Can the world stay within 1.5C?A: The Paris agreement signed 10 years ago bound countries to the goal of aiming to “limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above preindustrial levels”. This now seemsincreasingly unlikely, as global average temperatures for two consecutive years have risen above that level. That does not negate the Paris target, because it will be measured across a much longer period, but it does send aconcerning signal.Scientists fear further heating couldtrigger a series of tipping pointsthat could reinforce the heating trend and give it potentially unstoppable momentum.It may be possible toovershoot the 1.5C target and then lower temperatures, but this will be difficult and could require the use of unproven carbon capture and storage and removal techniques that draw carbon from the atmosphere. The best way of achieving it will be to minimise the temperature rise, and make the overshoot as brief as possible. That means cutting carbon as fast as possible now.Q: Will rich countries stump up climate finance for vulnerable ones?A: Last year’sCop29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, was the finance Cop where, for the first time, countries debated how much assistance should be provided from the rich world to the poor. The previous target of $100bn each year from 2020 was not subject to debate, but was adopted at Cop15 in Copenhagen in 2009.After two weeks of bitterness and hostility, Cop29 arrived at the same conclusion that had been predicted long before its start: an overarching goal of $1.3tn a year was to flow to the developing world by 2035, drawn from a wide variety of public and private sources and, within that, a pledge by developed countries to supply $300bn directly.View image in fullscreenDiscussions at Cop29 – the ‘finance Cop’ – take place behind Mukhtar Babayev, its president, in Baku.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APThedivisions, fights and unseemly wrangling of Cop29left a bitter taste for many, which Brazil has tried to heal and dispel. Part of that effort has been the preparation of aBaku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T, a joint report by the Cop29 and Cop30 presidencies published a few days before the start of Cop30.It contains more than 50 recommendations, none of which are binding on Cop30, but which will form the basis for discussions. They include raising money from oil and gas producers and other high-carbon activities, such aslevies on frequent flyersand transport.QL Will countries agree to mve away from fossil fuels?A: At Cop28 in Dubai in 2023, countries agreed for the first timeto “transition away from fossil fuels (Taff)”. No date was set for the phaseout, and no further details were given, but the resolution marked the first time the central cause of the climate crisis had been addressed in a Cop outcome.No sooner had the gavel descended than petrostate opponents of the deal were trying to unpick it. They suggested it was not a binding resolution but simply one of a menu of options, and that it did not necessarily apply to all fossil fuels.Last year, proponents of the “transition away” tried to strengthen it with a further resolution at Cop29, but they failed, in part because of the handling of the issue by theAzerbaijan Cop presidency.This year, they want to bring it back again, but the Brazilian presidency is wary. Scores of countries have raised objections in some forums, and the issue is a hot potato. Some developing countries with oil and gas deposits fear they will be prevented from exploiting them and want to ditch the issue; others in favour of the resolution are cautious, arguing that it was settled at Cop28 and it would be dangerous to reopen it. But many proponents fear that if it is not progressed in some form that gives a plan as to how it can be achieved, the “transition away from fossil fuels” will remain just a vague promise with little value.Brazil will have to find some way of navigating these shoals. One solution may be to set up a forum where countries can express their concerns freely, and without pressure, and that will take several years under successive Cop presidents to come up with a plan for the transition away from fossil fuels, rather than struggling to find an answer within two weeks.Q: Can Brazil create a forest-saving fund?A: The Amazon rainforest is everywhere in evidence in Belém, not least in the weather of this rainy city. Brazil brought world leaders here for a reason: President Lula’s leading project for Cop30 is theTropical Forests Forever Facility, a fund that will use initial cash injections from developed country governments to raise money from the private sector and financial markets, to spend on projects that help governments and local communities preserve their existing forests, rather than exploit them for short-term gain.Lula hopes to raise $25bn of initial funding, which will be used to create a $125bn fund. But the project has run into problems. Germany is likely to provide €1bn, and Norway is backing the fund to a similar amount. But the US will not contribute now under Donald Trump, and the UK disappointed the hostsby refusing to stump up cashat this stage, despite having been one of the key players in the early stages of the design of the fund.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer at Cop30’s Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) meeting. The UK has already disappointed its hosts by not yet committing money to the fund.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APPaying countries and communities with tropical forests to keep them standing is probably the best way yet found to preserve forests. The idea of doing so was endorsed two decades ago in the Stern review, and has a long pedigree. Alternatives, such as awarding forested countries carbon credits to besold on the carbon markets, have proved problematic.Without such payments, the need to raise cash for subsistence from exploiting the forest, through logging, ranching or conversion to soy or palm oil plantations, can be too strong. Nations also need money to combat illegal forces bent on forest destruction. Lula has succeeded in reining in the rampant deforestation that marred the tenure of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. But without international support in his efforts, Lula may face increasing difficulty at home.Q: Will Indigenous voices finally be listened to?A: Lula pledged that holding Cop in the Amazon would be an opportunity for Indigenous peoples to take the global stage, bringing their voices to the fore and their concerns, as well as celebrating their achievements.All Cops have a small number of Indigenous people attending, often standing out from the crowd in colourful traditional dress. But few achieve much of substance for them, beyond warm words.The difference at Cop30 is a new initiative from Brazil, called the global ethical stocktake. This takes inspiration from theglobal stocktake under the Paris agreement, which is a regular assessment of the progress made towards the 1.5C goal, by evaluating countries’ NDCs and the policies they are implementing to reach them.The global ethical stocktake will focus on the“moral, ethical and cultural” aspects of the climate crisis,including the ways in which it has an outsized impact on poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged people, on women, on children and on Indigenous people.It is not clear yet what influence the global ethical stocktake will have, but Brazil’s highly regarded environment minister, Marina Silva, will be in charge of ensuring it delivers for the people who need it most.View image in fullscreenMarina Silva, Brazil’s environment minister, will be enacting the new global ethical stocktake, surveying the moral aspects of the climate crisis.Photograph: Adriano Machado/ReutersQ: Can a quick win on methane be agreed?A: Cutting carbon is hard, but cutting the powerful greenhouse gasmethane gives more bang for the buck. About a third of the global heating of recent years may be down to rising methane levels, and each molecule has about 80 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. That meanscutting methane could be the “emergency brake”on temperatures that the planet desperately needs.There are relatively easy ways to achieve this – for instance, by stopping the venting or flaring of methane from oil and gas production facilities, staunching leaks from oil and gas wells and coalmines, andcapturing and using the methane from landfill rubbish dumps.But few countries enforce such rules, so the opportunity is lost. Brazil has shown little enthusiasm for methane action – the country has a huge agriculture sector, and cattle are another major contributor to global methane emissions – but addressing the issue would be a big help at this crucial juncture in the climate crisis.Brazil does have enthusiasm for biofuels – fuels from non-fossil sources – and this is controversial. Brazilian biofuels – much in evidence around Cop – are often efficiently produced, but around the world this is not always the case, and biofuels can displace nature,compete with food production for land, require the use of vast quantities of chemical fertiliser and water, and, in many cases, do not actually represent a substantial saving of carbon dioxide compared with fossil fuels. Many campaigners fear that thehost country’s plans for a quadrupling of “sustainable” fuels(mostly biofuels, but with some other synthetic fuels and hydrogen included) could have unintended poor consequences.Q: Will Trump scupper the talks in absentia?A: The US president, Donald Trump, will not attend Cop30, but he will overshadow it. The US, the world’s second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide after China, saw a boom in renewable energy under Joe Biden (though also an increase in fossil fuel exports) and further declines in its greenhouse gas output.Trump hasscrapped incentives for renewable energy,halted major projects, opened up new lands for oil and gas drilling and boosted the coal industry.The US NDC was submitted under Biden, but it was largely a symbolic gesture – Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, for the second time.While the world can carry on without the US, and while many states, cities and businesses within the US have also pledged to continue with their own climate plans, the actions of the president of the world’s biggest economy inevitably have far-reaching impacts. Trump has signalled in many forums that he rejects the international consensus on “multilateralism” – the idea that global problems should be solved by nations coming together in a spirit of cooperation, respect for each another and the rule of law.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump’s absence at Cop will not prevent him from overshadowing it – he has stated he will again withdraw the US from the Paris agreement.Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/APPartly for this reason, the Brazilian hosts have repeatedly said that one of the main tasks of the Cop will be to “send a signal that multilateralism works” – essentially, that means to get to the end of Cop without a major disruption or disaster, and have some kind of semblance of unity to leave Belém with.That will be hard enough in itself, given the fierce geopolitical headwinds this Cop faces. And if that is all that Cop achieves, it will be judged a failure.Q: Who will host Cop31 next year?A: Brazil got its bid in to host Cop30 early on, and was swiftly confirmed, so had two years to prepare for Belém. But the question of who will host Cop31 has still not been settled, despiteAustralia having announced its offer several years ago.Turkey is vying with Australia for the right to host next yearand, despite enjoying little support among the countries that will have a vote on the issue, shows no sign of giving up its bid.If nocompromisecan be found, or if one or other does not pull out of the contest, then the hosting of Cop31 will revert to the UNFCCC headquarters in Bonn, a prospect neither the German government nor the UN is likely to relish. But the bigger problem will be that whoever hosts now only has one year to prepare, which is a daunting task given thesize and complexity of modern Cops, compared with the smaller and simpler affairs of most Cops more than 10 years ago.Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilClimate crisisUnited NationsParis climate agreementClimate financeDeforestationexplainersShareReuse this content"

At the time, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said his detention appeared to be in retaliation for the Muslim political commentator’s criticism of Israel while touring the US, calling it a “blatant affront to free speech”, and called for his release.Later on 26 October, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin,saidthat Hamdi’s visa had been revoked and that he was in “ICE custody pending removal”.“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin said.In a separate statement that same day, the state departmentsaidthat the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity”.The Guardian reported last month that the US officials appeared to be referencing remarks Hamdi made following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, as on 27 October, the DHSshared a video clipby the pro-Israel group Memri, in which Hamdi was recorded saying that Palestinians should “celebrate their victory” and asked if they had felt “euphoria” over what had taken place.Hamdilater soughtto clarify his remarks. In anotherspeaking engagementseveral days after the Hamas attacks he said: “We don’t celebrate blood lust, we don’t celebrate death and we don’t celebrate war” adding that “what Muslims are celebrating is not war, they’re celebrating the revival of a cause – a just cause – that everybody thought was dead, this is an important distinction … I don’t celebrate war, I don’t celebrate death.”In aninterview with the Guardianin late October, Hamdi’s wife called the allegations against her husband “outrageous” and said the videos were “edited in a way to frame Sami in a horrible light and produced by an organization that is very well known to be anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, Islamophobic and out there to target people who are speaking up against the genocide against Palestinians”.On Monday, the California chapter of Cair, whose legal team has been representing Hamdi in court along with attorneys from the Muslim Legal Fund of America and The HMA Law Firm,confirmed in a statementthat Hamdi had accepted an offer to leave the US voluntarily.They added that the immigration charging document filed “in his case alleged only a visa overstay – after the government revoked his visa without cause and without prior notice – and never identified any criminal conduct or security grounds”.“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” Cair said.However, McLaughlin of DHS said in a statement: “Sami Hamdi, an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer who cheered on Hamas following its October 7 terrorist attack, requested voluntary departure and ICE is happily arranging his removal from this country.“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The Chinese government rejects accusations of forced labour, claiming Uyghur work programmes are for poverty alleviation.In October, Sheffield Hallam lifted the ban, and apologised to Murphy. But the case has caused widespread alarm about the influence of the Chinese government on UK universities, both in the form of specific threats and fears of losing access to the lucrative market of Chinese international students.Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said: “From what we have heard so far, Chinese government interference in our universities is a threat. We need to examine the extent of it and universities should have a co-ordinated response to it”.Last week, the Sheffield Hallam branch of the University and College Union (UCU) and the national executive committee of the UCU passed motions calling for a “full public inquiry” into the events at Sheffield Hallam. The motions also called for a government-led review into the ways in which commercial considerations are eroding academic free speech.Similar motions are expected to be tabled at regional UCU branches in the coming weeks.Bob Jeffrey, a branch officer for the Sheffield Hallam UCU, said: “Laura’s case really resonates with UCU members”. Academics in the UK havespoken outabout “extremely heaving” pressure from Beijing in the wake of the revelations about Sheffield Hallam.Internal emails from Sheffield Hallam revealed that Murphy’s work and the university’s business interests in China were considered to be “untenable bedfellows”. The university said the emails did not represent university policy and that the decision to block Murphy’s research was not based on commercial interests.Separately, Sheffield Hallam has beenreferred to counter-terrorism policeover concerns that it assisted a foreign intelligence service, in this case China, when it blocked Murphy’s research.Staff at Sheffield Hallam are going on strike on Tuesday amid concerns about job cuts and the university’s handling of Murphy’s case.Jo Grady, the general secretary of the UCU, said: “It is incredibly worrying that Sheffield Hallam appears to have attempted to silence its own professor on behalf of a foreign government”.There has been growing concern for years that the higher education sector’s dependence on international student fees from China is a vulnerability for universities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They pay billions in tuition fees, which many universities see as an economic lifeline.Collaboration with Chinese students is also seen as beneficial to the UK’s own research output, particularly in science and technology fields, although some have warned of the security risks of certain types of joint research projects.In 2023, parliament’s intelligence and security committeewarnedthat China could gain political influence and economic advantages in the UK by “controlling the narrative of debate about China within UK universities” by exerting influence on academics and Chinese students.The UK ranks at thetop of a listof countries affected by Chinese government influence in academia on the China Index, a project by Doublethink Lab that monitors Chinese overseas influence.Beijing has reacted strongly to the reports about Sheffield Hallam, with one article in the state-run Global Times stating: “Western scholars essentially only have the freedom to express anti-China sentiments, not the right to conduct free research”.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said: “China firmly opposes activities by any institution or individual to slander and smear China by fabricating falsehoods and spreading lies.“The individual concerned has herself admitted to the media that she received funding and support from US government agencies and other sources to conduct this so-called ‘research’, which specifically aims at attacking China’s Xinjiang policies. It is evident that what she is doing is part of the disgraceful political campaign of defaming China under the disguise of ‘academic freedom’ or ‘freedom of speech’.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHouse of CommonsUniversitiesHigher educationChinaEmily ThornberryAsia PacificSheffield Hallam UniversitynewsShareReuse this content"

The style is named after Fair Isle, the southernmost of the Shetland Islands. Itcomprises a distinct set of motifs with two colours in every row and was popularised by Edward VIII.Shetland’s Organisation for Knitters (SOK), founded earlier this year to “preserve and protect our knitting heritage”, pointed out some of the most egregious errors in a social media post. It cited the use of chunky yarn and 10mm needles instead of the traditional 2.5 or 3mm width; referring to smaller designs as “peerie patterns”, a term not used by Shetlanders; as well as the “just unrealistic” challenge to knit a Fair Isle tank top in 12 hours.Shetland knitters were especially perplexed at Daley’s horror when a contestant, Gordon Cree, was the first to leave the programme after failing to beat the deadline.View image in fullscreenFair Isle knitwear. The style was popularised by Edward VIII in the 1920s.Photograph: Elizabeth JohnstonElizabeth Johnston, a trustee of SOK who began her Fair Isle apprenticeship before she started school, said the anger should be understood as a response to what for many is the final straw – or perhaps pin – after decades of fudging of terms and techniques.“The problem is that a lot of businesses, designers, pattern publishers use the term Fair Isle and its techniques incorrectly,” she added. “The term is used for any kind of stranded knitted of which there are many, but Fair Isle is a distinct set of patterns and unique knitting skills that have been passed down through generations.“Everyone did it back in time, both to wear themselves and to sell, but the culture has changed and we need to educate the generations below us to keep the knowledge going. We want to educate the rest of the world from Shetland.”View image in fullscreenHelen Barwick said the Fair Isle technique was rooted in the people and textiles of Shetland.Photograph: Helen BarwickHelen Barwick, who runs Shetland Stitch Club, a mobile sewing school, said knitting was a feminist issue: “You have to remember that this is a huge industry up here, and traditionally a way for Shetland women to earn a decent income, that has been killed off by fast fashion which labels designs as Fair Isle when they don’t stick to the tradition of even using Shetland wool.”In an open letter to Channel 4, she said the Fair Isle tradition was rooted in the people and the textiles of the islands.“It is done with Shetland wool, from native Shetland sheep – a fibre so brilliant that it gave rise to this long tradition. The natural variation in colour of the fleece lends itself brilliantly to colour work, and its natural crimp means the fibres cling and felt together, creating a patterned fabric every bit as dense and strong and something made in one yarn.”Barwick, who moved to Shetland last year after falling for the Fair Isle technique at a class in London, is keen to emphasise that the furore should not be misconstrued as knitters being precious about their craft.“It’s such a welcoming community and Shetland wool week is a joyful sharing of skills and knowledge,” she said. “But it makes me sad that it’s so difficult to make a living out of knitting nowadays. The reasons that Fair Isle is still thriving is through the unpaid labour of these passionate practitioners.”Channel 4 has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsScotlandKnittingTom DaleyChannel 4CraftTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The registered owner of the car has reportedly been detained for questioning.The fire service said the blast injured 19 people, who were being treated at a government hospital. Large train stations across India, the financial capital Mumbai, and the state of Uttar Pradesh, which borders Delhi, were all put on high alert, authorities said.Police said a slow-moving car had stopped at a red light just outside the Red Fort metro station before the blast. “An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to the explosion, nearby vehicles were also damaged,” said the Delhi police commissioner, Satish Golcha.Dozens of fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene after the blast. Footage on Indian TV news channels showed the chaos of the aftermath, including a car with its doors blasted off, mangled bodies and people screaming in panic. More than a dozen other cars, rickshaws and motorcycles were blackened and burned in the fire caused by the explosion.Om Prakash Gupta, a witness who lives close to the scene, said he was at home when he heard a loud explosion. “I rushed out with my children and saw several vehicles on fire, body parts all over,” he told The Associated Press. He said he saw one body on the windscreen of a car.A cab driver, who gave his name as just Shahrukh, said he heard a loud explosion. “I came out of the car and started running along with others on the road,” he said.Another witness told NDTV the force of the blast had sent shock waves through nearby buildings. “One person’s body was torn into pieces. I saw a hand on the road,” he said. “It was a very strong explosion.”Golcha confirmed at least eight people had been killed and 20 injured. “The situation is being monitored. We are investigating the incident and will update you shortly,” he added.India’s home affairs minister, Amit Shah, said it was “difficult to say what caused the incident until the samples recovered from the blast site are analysed”.As he travelled to the explosion site, Shah added: “We do not consider any angle closed. We will investigate all angles with determination.”In a post on X, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he was reviewing the situation with Shah. “Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi earlier this evening. May the injured recover at the earliest. Those affected are being assisted by authorities,” he said.The Red Fort, known as Lal Qila, is located in the heavily congested Old Delhi area of India’s capital which is usually heaving with people, food stalls and vehicles and is a popular tourist destination.A vast 17th-century Mughal palace, the fort is one of India’s most significant monuments. The prime minister makes an annual address on the fort’s ramparts on Independence Day and it features on the country’s banknotes.Delhi was the target of blasts during the 1980s and 1990s, with public places such as bus stations and crowded market areas hit in attacks blamed on Islamist militants or on separatists from the northern Sikh state of Punjab.About a dozen people were killed in a briefcase explosion outside the Delhi high court in 2011 – the last such major incident in the city.Security in the national capital is the responsibility of the federal home ministry. Delhi police report directly to it, though the capital territory also has its own local government.Explore more on these topicsIndiaDelhiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It also depicts her coach-turned-husband’s physical abuse, culminating in an attempt on her life. The film received mixed reviews, with some critics praising Sweeney’s performance, in which she plays Martin over 20 years, as worthy of award consideration.In hisreviewfor the Guardian, critic Benjamin Lee said the film “just isn’t nearly good enough, a by-the-numbers slog that fails to prove Sweeney’s status as a one to watch”.As she has in promotion for the film, Sweeney highlighted its handling of domestic violence in her Instagram post. “This film stands for survival, courage, and hope,” she wrote. “Through our campaigns, we’ve helped raise awareness for so many affected by domestic violence. We all signed on to this film with the belief that Christy’s story could save lives.“Thank you to everyone who saw, felt, and believed and will believe in this story for years to come,” she added. “If Christy gave even one woman the courage to take her first step toward safety, then we will have succeeded.”‘I can’t control how others perceive me’: Sydney Sweeney on boxing, weight gain and her flair for controversyRead moreChristy was the first theatrical release from Black Bear, an indie company which also produced the film for $15m and sold its international distribution rights. It’s the latest in a tough year at the box office for Sweeney, abreakout starfrom the HBO dramas Euphoria and The White Lotus. BothEden, a survival thriller in which Sweeney co-starred with Ana de Armas and Vanessa Kirby, andAmericana, a drama co-starring Paul Walter Hauser, fizzled at the box office this summer.It’s also the latest example of adult-oriented dramas struggling to connect with theatrical audiences. Like Christy, the psychodramaDie, My Love, starring Robert Pattinson and Jennifer Lawrence, as well as the Bruce Springsteen biopicDeliver Me From Nowhereand another boxing drama, The Rock’sThe Smashing Machine, all garnered praise along the festival circuit but disappointed at the box office.Sweeney, who led romantic comedy Anyone But You to a $220m worldwide gross, will next appear on screen alongside Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar in The Housemaid, directed by Paul Feig. The psychological thriller, based on the 2022 novel by Freida McFadden, will premiere in the US on 19 December.Explore more on these topicsSydney SweeneyShareReuse this content"

They also said Maxwell had been receiving special treatment at federal prison camp Bryan in Texas – the minimum-security facility she wastransferredto earlier this year.Congressman Jamie Raskin, the ranking member and top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, stated in a news release that the prison’s warden was also “helping” Maxwell “copy, print, and send documents” to support her bid for clemency.The exact content of this “commutation application” was unclear, Raskin added.Raskin states that according to the whistleblower, Maxwell has been receiving “customized” meals that are “personally delivered” to her cell, and that the warden has “personally arranged” private meetings for Maxwell and her visitors. The visits allegedly include providing a “special cordoned-off area” for visitors to arrive, as well as “an assortment of snacks and refreshments for her guests”.Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly ‘much happier’ after prison transfer by Trump officialsRead moreMaxwell’s visitors were also reportedly permitted to bring computers, which, Raskin described in the news release as an “unprecedented action by the Warden given the security risk and potential for Ms Maxwell to use a computer to conduct unmonitored communications with the outside world”.In one alleged instance, the whistleblower said that when phone lines went down for other inmates, Maxwell was given specific instructions about who she should tell her contacts to call and how those personnel would then connect to relay the call to Maxwell.The whistleblower further reportedly told the HouseDemocratsthat when Maxwell wanted to review and edit documents “quickly”, she “essentially used” the warden as her “personal secretary and administrative assistant”. The news release states that Maxwell’s correspondents would email documents directly to the warden, who would provide them to Maxwell, “who would review and edit them and provide them back to the Warden to scan and provide to the original sender”.Other privileges allegedly granted to Maxwell also include time to “play with” a service dog – a perk that the news release states is not “ordinarily allowed” –   as well as private after-hours access to the prison exercise area.Maxwell’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian regarding the whistleblower’s claims.In a statement to the Guardian, Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said that “the White House does not comment on potential clemency requests”.“As President Trump has stated, pardoningGhislaine Maxwellis not something he has thought about,” Jackson added.Over the weekend,reports surfacedthat Maxwell told friends and family in emails from prison that she was “much happier” at the Texas facility than her previous prison.In August, Maxwell wasmovedfrom a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to the minimum-security camp in Texas, where most of the inmates are serving time fornon-violent offenses and white-collar crimes. The transfer, which experts described as “unprecedented”, occurred just days after she wasinterviewedabout the Epstein case by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche – who also previously served asDonald Trump’s personal lawyer.That interview came as the Trump administration was facing mounting pressure to release more documents related to the Epstein investigation and amid intense speculation around the president’sown personal tiesto the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender, who was founddead in a New York jailin 2019 while awaiting prosecution on sex-trafficking charges.In the news release on Monday, Raskin also announced that he had sent aletterto Trump demanding answers about the whistleblower’s allegations, and also called on the president to reject Maxwell’s commutation request.“You should not grant any form of clemency to this convicted and unrepentant sex offender,” Raskin wrote in theletter. “Your Administration should not be providing her with room service, with puppies to play with, with federal law enforcement officials waiting on her every need, or with any special treatment or institutional privilege at all.”Raskin requested that Blanche appear for a public congressional hearing to discuss the revelations and also posed three questions to Trump.Raskin asked whether Trump had discussed a potential commutation, or any form of presidential clemency, for Maxwell with Blanche or others; whether he had directed Blanche or anyone else in the administration to provide Maxwell with the transfer to the prison camp, or to give her favorable and preferential treatment in prison; and lastly whether Maxwell, her attorneys, family or representatives have made any promises to Trump or his attorneys.House Democrat accuses Trump’s DoJ of ‘gigantic cover-up’ over shut Epstein inquiryRead moreRaskin has asked for a response to the questions by 24 November.In another statement on Monday, Democratic representative Robert Garcia, the ranking member of the committee on oversight and government reform, called on Republican House speaker Mike Johnson and Republican representative James Comer, who chairs the oversight committee, to “publicly oppose a commutation or pardon by President Trump.“Ghislaine Maxwell is a convicted sex offender who helpedJeffrey Epsteincommit atrocities and rape against women and girls for decades,” Garcia said. “For months, we have been warning the American people that Trump’s Department of Justice is providing her with unprecedented benefits as a prisoner, including moving her to a less restrictive facility.“Thanks to brave whistleblowers and our partners on the judiciary committee, we have more evidence that Maxwell is seeking a pardon or commutation,” he added.In October, the US supreme courtdeclined to hearan appeal from Maxwell on her sex-trafficking conviction.Explore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellHouse of RepresentativesJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsDonald TrumpDemocratsUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The letter was first reported by the Associated Press.The deal fits the administration’s contentious third-country deportation push, which has alarmed human rights monitors. UN expertswarned in Julythe policy could see people removed to foreign countries within a single day, without adequate legal safeguards or chance to raise torture or persecution concerns.Washington has approachedat least 58 governmentsabout accepting deportees, often securing agreements through cash payments or diplomatic pressure including travel ban threats. Nearly all the countries involved – including Eswatini, South Sudan and El Salvador – feature in state department reports for serious human rights abuses.“Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” said a state department spokesperson in response to an inquiry from the Guardian. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.“We have no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments,” the response added.Christopher Landau, the US deputy secretary of state, met in September with Obiang, the vice-president, who was convicted by a Parisian court in 2017 of embezzling tens of millions of euros and laundering the proceeds in France. The US Department of Justice in 2012 determined he had spent $315m around the world on properties, supercars and other luxury goods. The US ultimately seized more than $27m from the official, including properties, luxury cars and a white jewel-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson during his Bad tour.During the meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Landau and Obiang “reaffirmed joint commitments to deepen commercial and economic ties, combat illegal immigration, and advance security cooperation”, the state department said. Obiang in late October confirmed he would cooperate with the Trump administration on the “orderly reception of undocumented immigrants, under strict joint protocols designed to guarantee a safe and coordinated process”.Observers noted that the deal was conducted in relative secrecy for an administration that has been proud of its efforts to hammer out agreements for the deportation of third-country nationals (TCNs) who could not be sent back to their home countries.“Knowing that this was a direct transfer of money to a government that is highly corrupt ... was a red flag,” said a congressional aide, who called the deal a “notable, egregious agreement”.Funds for Migration and Refugee Assistance are traditionally used for “responding to refugee and humanitarian crises overseas”, said the aide, such as those in Gaza or Sudan, rather than the removal of non-citizens from the US.There are “plenty of places where these funds should be used to support refugees overseas in the midst of conflict or humanitarian crises. There’s certainly need. So again, why are we sending this to Equatorial Guinea?”Another congressional Democratic aide said it’s possible the state department only shared the agreement with Republican lawmakers, who have been “grossly partisan recently – even more than usual”.The office of James Risch, a Republican senator, who chairs the foreign relations committee, did not immediately return a request for comment on how long the agreement has been on the table.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationEquatorial GuineaUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

How can a loss-making startup such asOpenAIafford such a staggering spending commitment?Answer that positively and it will go a long way to easing investor concerns over bubble warnings in the artificial intelligence boom, from lofty tech company valuations to a mooted$3tn global spend on datacentres.The company behind ChatGPT needs a vast amount of computing power – or compute, in tech jargon – to train its models, produce their responses and build even more powerful systems in the future. The cost of its compute commitment – the AI infrastructure such as chips and servers that power its world famous chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure that dwarfs its $13bn in annual revenues.Boom or bubble? Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spreeRead moreOver the past week this gap has appeared chasm-like, becoming a backdrop tomarket nerves over AI spendingand statements by OpenAI executives that did little to answer concerns.Sam Altman, the OpenAI chief executive, first attempted to deal with it in an awkward exchange with a leading investor in the company, Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital, that ended with Altman ordering: “enough”.Speaking on his podcastwith Altman last month, Gerstner described the company’s ability to pay for more than $1tn in compute costs, while revenue is running at $13bn a year, as a question “hanging over the market”.Altman responded: “First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough.”Then last week the OpenAI chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, suggested that the US government could underwrite some of the chip spending.“This is where we’re looking for an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental, the ways governments can come to bear,” she told the Wall Street Journal, adding that such a guarantee “can really drop the cost of financing”.Was OpenAI, which recently announced it is becoming a fully fledgedfor-profit companyworth $500bn, really saying that AI companies should be treated like banks in the late 2000s? This triggered immediate attempts at clarification from Friar, who took to LinkedIn to deny that OpenAI was seeking a federal backstop, while Altman sought to set the record straight on X.In a long post, Altman wrote “we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters”, adding that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make “bad business decisions”. Instead, perhaps, the government should build its own AI infrastructure and give loan guarantees to support chip manufacturing in the US.Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, says OpenAI is trying to match the other big AI players such as Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Google and Microsoft – itself a leading backer of OpenAI – which are supported by their already hugely profitable business models.“OpenAI wants to match or exceed the infrastructure – the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of compute – of the big platform companies. But those companies have cashflows from their existing businesses to pay for this and OpenAI does not, so it’s trying to bootstrap its way into the club,” he says.View image in fullscreenAltman believes that $1.4tn can be paid off by future demand for OpenAI products and by ever-improving models.Photograph: Stephen Brashear/APThere are also questions over the circular nature of some of OpenAI’s compute deals. For instance, Oracle will spend $300bn building new datacentres for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin – and OpenAI will then pay back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres.Under the terms of a transaction with Nvidia, the leading maker of the chips that AI companies use, OpenAI will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.Altman also addressed the revenue issue, writing that OpenAI expects to end the year above $20bn in annualised revenue and then grow to “hundreds of billion[s]” by 2030.He added: “Based on the trends we are seeing of how people are using AI and how much of it they would like to use, we believe the risk of OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It makes its revenues from ChatGPT subscriptions for consumers –which account for 75% of its income– and offering businesses its corporate versions of ChatGPT, while also allowing companies and start ups to build their own products with its AI models.One Silicon Valley investor, who does not have a financial interest in OpenAI, says OpenAI can build on its popularity but its success is contingent on factors such as the models improving, the cost of operating them getting cheaper and the chips used to power them becoming less costly.“The belief is that OpenAI can leverage its strong brand and ChatGPT’s position as a popular choice among consumers and businesses to build a suite of high value and high margin products. The question is at what scale can they build out these products and revenue models and how good can these models get,” says the investor.But it is loss-making. OpenAI says reporting of its losses, including reports that it lost $8bn in the first half of the year and about $12bn in the third quarter, are inaccurate, although it does not deny it loses money or provide alternative figures.Altman believes the revenue will come from a number of sources. For instance: growing demand for paid-for versions of ChatGPT; other companies using its datacentres; people buying thehardware devices it is buildingwith iPhone designer Sir Jony Ive; and that “huge value” will be created by AI’s achievements in scientific research.So that is the bet: OpenAI needs $1.4tn worth of compute, a number dwarfing its current revenues, because it believes demand and ever better iterations of its products will pay it off.Carl Benedikt Frey, author of How Progress Ends and the associate professor of AI and work at Oxford University, is sceptical about OpenAI’s hopes and points to recentevidence of a slowdownin AI adoption in the world’s largest economy. The US Census Bureau, for instance,reportedthat AI adoption has been declining in recent months among companies with more than 250 employees.“On various measures AI adoption has been falling in the US since the summer. We do not know exactly why, but it does suggest that we are at a stage where some users and businesses feel they are not quite getting what they hoped for from AI so far,” says Frey, adding that without “new breakthroughs” at the company he does not see it reaching $100bn in revenue by 2027 – a figure Altman hashinted at.OpenAI says it is seeing accelerating business adoption, with the corporate version of ChatGPT growing nine times year over year as it gains customers from an array of sectors including banking, life sciences and manufacturing.Altman acknowledged on X, nonetheless, that the bet might not pay off.“But of course we could be wrong, and the market – not the government – will deal with it if we are.”Explore more on these topicsOpenAITechnology sectorSam AltmanArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Potential strategic bazookas included an £8bnsale of the Guinness brandor Diageo’s 34% stake in the champagne and cognac business Moët Hennessy.Diageo insiders are understood to have admired Crew’s grasp on what needed fixing but felt she lacked the bold strategic vision to steer the company out of the doldrums, let alone the ability to convince the City that she could.Underlying the strategic concerns were long-term trends, such as declining drinking rates, particularly among younger people.Diageo share price chartLast August, Fundsmith, the investment management company run by the City veteran Terry Smith, sold its holding in Diageo, a stake it had held since 2010.Smith highlighted the rise of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy. These, he said, had shown signs of effectiveness in helping people cut down on their drinking,threatening global booze salesin perpetuity.Drastic times called for “Drastic Dave”.Lewis earned that moniker during nearly three decades at the consumer juggernaut Unilever and cemented it at Tesco.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chris Beckett, a consumer staples analyst at Quilter Cheviot, thinks Lewis would have licence to rip off the plaster, incurring more short-term pain for the share price, for long-term gain.Beckett pointed out that curbing the shareholder payout was one of Lewis’s first acts when he took over at Tesco in 2014, “whether you call it ‘kitchen sinking’ or simply accepting the reality of an overleveraged balance sheet”.But macroeconomic challenges will remain.Consumer confidence remains brittle worldwide, while Donald Trump’s tariffs continue to cast a pall over consumer goods. Over the longer term, questions remain over whether theimpact of weight-loss drugs– and the sobriety of generation Z – are cyclical trends or the new normal.Some things even Drastic Dave cannot fix.Explore more on these topicsDiageoFood & drink industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

Competition between Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX has been intensifying in recent months.To relieve airspace congestion during the US federal government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration is limiting commercial rocket liftoffs starting Monday. But after scrubbing the launch Blue Origin said late Sunday that, in coordination with the FAA, it was aiming for another attempt as soon as Wednesday within the window of 2.50pm to 4.17pm Eastern Standard time.When it eventually launches, the 322f (98-meter) New Glenn rocket has the task of sending US space agency Nasa’s Escapade twin spacecraft to Mars, in an effort to study the Red Planet’s climate history with the eventual hope of human exploration.Blue Origin’s launch is to also serve as a key test of whether it can achieve booster recovery, which would prove a technical breakthrough for the company if successful.New Glenn’s inaugural flight in January was marked as a success, as its payload achieved orbit and successfully performed tests. But its first-stage booster, which was meant to be reusable, did not stick its landing on a platform in the Atlantic, and instead was lost during descent.In its second effort Blue Origin will try once more to recover the booster stage. Thus far, only Musk’s company SpaceX has managed that feat.The competing companies of billionaires Musk and Bezos are locked in a commercial space race that recently escalated, as Nasa opened up bids for its planned moon mission, complaining that SpaceX was lagging behind.Donald Trump’s second term in the White House has seen the administration pile pressure on Nasa to accelerate its progress to send a crewed mission to the Moon amid a race with China.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He revived Britain’s biggest supermarket chain after revealing an accounting scandal, which threatened the future of the business.His appointment marks a significant coup for the drinks maker, which owns more than 200 brands including Johnnie Walker whisky, Smirnoff vodka, Baileys Irish Cream and Don Julio tequila. He replaces Debra Crew, a former captain in US military intelligence who stepped down as the Diageo chief in July after a rocky two-year tenure, with investors unhappy about the company’slacklustre performance.Nik Jhangiani, the former chief financial officer who had been tipped as a frontrunner for the permanent job, will continue to lead the business on an interim basis until the end of the year, and then return to his CFO role..Ashock profits warning in 2023followed a post-Covid rebound in alcohol consumption. Since then, Diageo has struggled as consumers have reined in spending and many younger people drink less than older generations. In February, it dropped its long-term sales target.The company has struggled with supply chain issues, misjudging waning demand in Latin America and leaving that market overstocked whileUK pubs had to ration Guinnessin the run-up to last Christmas, just as festive demand increased.Diageo has also beenhit by Donald Trump’s US trade tariffsand last week issued a profit warning, saying it expected 2026 sales to be flat or slightly lower, which sent its shares to 10-year lows. Sales were flat in the three months to 30 September this year, with growth in Europe, Latin America and Africa offset by weak sales of Chinese white spirits and weaker-than-expected US consumer spending.Lewis has chaired Haleon since the consumer health business was spun off by GSK in 2022, and will step down from this role on 31 December. He will also give up his role as an operating adviser at Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, a US private equity firm that acquired Morrisons in 2021 in a £7bn deal.It is understood that Lewis will continue to chair the renewable energy company Xlinks, whichhad hoped to build the world’s longest subsea power cablefrom Morocco to Britain butfailed to gain government support for the project.Diageo shares were the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, up 7%, while Haleon shares fell as much as 1.4% before recovering, trading broadly flat.When Lewis took the helm of Tesco, the supermarket giant was in crisis. It had a mountain of debt after years of empire building under the former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, anddiscovered a gaping black hole in its accounts.During a five-year turnaround, Lewis went back to basics, focused on how Tesco’s prices and products compared with rivals such as Aldi and Lidl, halved the £22bn debt pile and slashed costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Banga – who worked with Lewis at Unilever during his 33-year spell at the consumer goods company – also chairs UK Government Investments Limited ,is a partner at CD&R, and has sat on the boards of GSK and Marks & Spencer.Matt Britzman, a senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Lewis brings deep experience in consumer brands from his time leading Tesco and decades at Unilever, though he lacks direct exposure to the spirits industry.“Investors may welcome his strong marketing pedigree, but any major strategic reset will take time, leaving near-term focus on navigating tough trading conditions.”Explore more on these topicsDiageoFood & drink industryCorporate governanceDave LewisnewsShareReuse this content"

Here, he reflects on AI’s ‘robbing’ of his voice, not believing in Black History Month – and why he’s nowhere near retirementDavid SmithMon 10 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 10.40 ESTShareIn a dishonest age when truth is under siege, media attention shatters into a thousand shards of glass and nothing is quite what it seems, what could be more precious than a voice of authority? Cue Morgan Freeman, an actor who has portrayed a US president,Nelson Mandelaand the Almighty, and replaced Walter Cronkite on the voiceover introducing the CBS Evening News. If John Gielgud’s baritone was described as being “like a silver trumpet muffled in silk”, Freeman’s is like rich wood polished to a quiet shine.It was less God’s gift than the product of hard work, thanks to an inspiring voice and diction instructor at his community college in Los Angeles. “If you’re going to speak, speak distinctly, hit your final consonants and do exercises to lower your voice,” says Freeman, dapper in light jacket , via video call from New York. “Most people’s voices are higher than they would be normally if they knew how to relax it. He taught that sort of thing. It was Robert Whitman: I will never forget him.”Yet the 88-year-old’s signature voice is no longer entirely his own. Hollywood is reeling from artificial intelligence that can replicate the way actors look and sound. The late James Earl Jones consented to the use of AI to replicate his voice as Darth Vader after he stepped away from the role. Freeman has not. “I’m a little PO’d, you know,” he says. “I’m like any other actor: don’t mimic me with falseness. I don’t appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you’re gonna do it without me, you’re robbing me.”Has it already been happening? “Well, I tell you, my lawyers have been very, very busy.” They have already found cases and are pursuing them? “Many, yeah. Quite a few.”View image in fullscreenAs Thaddeus Bradley in the Now You See Me trilogy.Photograph: Steve DietlFreeman is equally unenthusiastic about Tilly Norwood, an entirely synthetic person regarded as the first “AI actor”, who was officially unveiled in September. “Nobody likes her because she’s not real and that takes the part of a real person, so it’s not going to work out very well in the movies or in television … The union’s job is to keep actors acting, so there’s going to be that conflict.”Freeman is here to talk about Now You See Me: Now You Don’t, the third in a trilogy of films about a group of illusionists called the Four Horsemen who use magic tricks to pull off audacious heists. He has a cameo role as magician Thaddeus Bradley, who was a foe in the first movie, an ally in the second and has now evolved into a mentor who shares a country pile (filmed at a 150-year-old mansion near Budapest) with a hall of mirrors and Harry Houdini’s straitjacket. Indeed, far from embracing AI special effects, the director Ruben Fleischer went in the opposite direction, bringing in illusionists to teach the cast authentic tricks.Freeman has always appreciated hard-earned craft. His beginnings were humble: his father was a barber, his mother was a teacher. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and spent most of his early years near Greenwood, Mississippi, in the Jim Crow south. From a young age, he knew what he wanted to do. Saturday matinee cowboy serials lit the spark.By 12, he had won a statewide drama competition; in high school, he performed in a radio play in Nashville. “I had the most encouraging teachers you could imagine,” he recalls. “One of my teachers told me, you can go anywhere and do anything you want.”View image in fullscreenFreeman in the children’s TV series The Electric Company, 1971.Photograph: John D Kisch/Separate Cinema Archive/Getty ImagesThere was a potential alternative timeline, however. “I never had moments of self-doubt about it but, when I was a teenager, I was fascinated by flying so, when I graduated from high school, I went into the air force with the idea at the time of becoming a fighter pilot.“That lasted until I got into the cockpit of a trainer and had that epiphany that ‘this is not what you want’. It turns out, I was just in San Bernardino, at Norton Air Force Base, being discharged and only a 45-minute bus ride from Los Angeles, California. Fate is the hunter.”From Amistad and Seven to Unforgiven and The Dark Knight, he has appeared in more than 100 films along with dozens of TV dramas and documentaries. In the 1970s, that included 780 episodes of the children’s series The Electric Company. His big break in Hollywood did not come until 1987, when he was nearly 50, playing a vicious pimp in Street Smart, and earning a supporting actor Oscar nomination.Two years later he starred in Driving Miss Daisy (reprising his stage role as Hoke Colburn, the chauffeur for a Jewish widow) and Glory, about an African American regiment in the civil war. Since then the hits have kept flowing. “If you do something that’s well received and it lasts years, people talk about the fact that you were in that, so it feels nice,” Freeman reflects. He must get that a lot withThe Shawshank Redemption? “Heavens, yes,” he says with a chuckle. “It’s like I was not ever in anything else.”View image in fullscreenPlaying a pimp opposite Christopher Reeve in Street Smart, 1987.Photograph: Cannon/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn Shawshank, he plays a seasoned prison inmate who befriends a rookie played by Tim Robbins. The movie initially flopped at the box office when it was released in 1994, but rallied on VHS video. It is now the No 1-ranked movie on the Internet Movie Database’sTop 250 chart, and in 2006 it was voted the greatest movie of all time by readers of Empire magazine. Just as Jaws or Star Wars are unthinkable without John Williams’ scores, Shawshank would not be half the film without Freeman’s wry narration.Freeman has his own thoughts about the film’s popularity: “I always say that it’s a movie about a love affair between two men, in that they had their ups and downs and ins and outs. And it’s something about the fact that they were in prison and experiencing this hope, redemption, resilience. Somehow that movie has grabbed the consciences of people all over the place, everywhere.“When the movie first came out, it didn’t do well at all. You know why? ‘Shawshank Redemption’ – [people] couldn’t remember that. ‘Saw this great movie. It was the Shank … Shim … Shanks … something like that.’ If you don’t get word of mouth, that’s it, you’re dead in the water. It’s as simple as that.”By this time, Freeman was already well into his streak of documentary voiceovers and authority-figure roles, from God (in 2003’s Bruce Almighty and its 2007 sequel Evan Almighty) downwards. Biblical gravitas had become his brand, you could say.View image in fullscreenWith Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption, 1994.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Columbia/AllstarHe’s not sure how he feels about that: “Gravitas, yeah. I don’t know, I’ve done comedies. But I’ll take it. It works for me, so no arguments.” He laughs. “It was interesting, though, the outcome of playing God in the movies. Audiences bought it. I meanboughtit. I walk into a room and they say: ‘God just walked in.’ I say something, they say: ‘Oh, it’s the voice of God.’ That went on for the longest time. Ooooo-Kay! Be careful there.” That must be a lot of pressure? “I vociferously avoid the pressure. It’s like, be cool, hold that down, don’t try to convince me that that’s who I am.”Freeman won a best supporting actor Oscar for his role as a gym assistant and former boxer in the Clint Eastwood sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004). Five years later, teaming up with Eastwood again, he was Oscar-nominated for his portrayal of Mandela in Invictus (2009).It was the story of how the South African president used the power of sport to heal the scars of apartheid, specifically by embracing Afrikaners’ cherished sport, rugby, as South Africa hosted the World Cup in 1995. Freeman says of Mandela: “When his book, Long Walk to Freedom, came out and he had a press conference, a reporter asked him flat out: ‘If your book becomes a movie, who would you want to play you?’ He saidMorgan Freeman.”View image in fullscreenFreeman’s performance as Nelson Mandela in Invictus in 2009 earned him an Oscar nomination.Photograph: Keith Bernstein/THA/ShutterstockAnant Singh, a film producer who had bought the rights to Long Walk to Freedom, put the two men in touch. “I told him [Mandela], if this happens and I do get to play you, I want to have access to you because I need to hold your hand. And he made that happen. Any time we were within proximity of each other, I was able to go and spend time with him and literally hold his hand and listen to him. Playing him was just a joy. I think I almost sounded like him.”He remembers Mandela, who died in 2013, as a man of modest ego. “We screened the movie for him and he said: ‘Well, maybe now they’ll remember me.’ Humble: that was Mandela. He didn’t get any different in his persona outside prison from what he had spent the whole 27 years in.”Freeman has had his fair share of flops too, of course. Not least among them Brian De Palma’s The Bonfire of the Vanities, released in 1990, co-starring Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith. Hotly anticipated at the time, it received a critical mauling and has now achieved a near-mythic notoriety.You’re opening up a can of worms here. No, I do not believe in a Black History MonthAsked if he has learned lessons from such failures, Freeman replies: “I don’t know if I actually can say I’ve learned a lesson. What I try to do is good work; do your job and the rest will take care of itself. I don’t know if there was a lesson that I learned while working. I think it was a lesson I’d known all along. I started acting in elementary school so I was always going to do it, whether I thought I was or not.”The indefatigable Freeman endorsed Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential bid and recorded a voiceover for the video introduction of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. In recent years he hasspoken out against the terms “Black History Month”and “African American”.Seven at 30: David Fincher’s devilish thriller is a chilling immersion in evilRead moreDoes he still feel that way, now that Donald Trump has set about rewriting Black history from the White House? “David, you’re opening up a can of worms here with me. No, I do not believe in aBlack History Month. There’s something about it that separates it from American history. I don’t mind being called a Black man: that’s what I am. I don’t want to be called African American. I’m not African and that’s the bottom of it. That’s all I say.”Pressed for his thoughts on Trump’s second term, Freeman hesitates, then mutters, “I don’t want to talk about politics,” while publicists for the film, audibly uncomfortable, stage an intervention: “Hey, David, we need to keep this movie-focused.”In 2008, Freeman’s left hand was paralysed due to nerve damage from a car accident in Mississippi: his vehicle flipped multiple times and he had to be cut out by emergency crews. He wears a compression glove on the hand to help with chronic pain and keep blood flowing. That put an end to him piloting a private jet. Freeman had learned to fly and earned his licence in 2002, going on to own at least three planes. It was not quite his teenage dream of becoming a fighter pilot but did prove convenient for commuting from Mississippi to Hollywood. “You need two hands to fly,” he says matter-of-factly.He has now been screen acting for more than six decades but has little interest in retirement. “Sometimes the idea of retirement would float past me but, as soon as my agent says there’s a job or somebody wants you or they’ve made an offer, the whole thing just boils back into where it was yesterday: how much you’re going to pay, where we’re gonna be?“The appetite is still there. I will concede that it’s dimmed a little. But not enough to make a serious difference.”Now You See Me: Now You Don’t is released in UK cinemas on 14 November, and in Australian cinemas on 13 November"

For my new book, artists and writers shared their advice on how to live life artfullyKaty HesselMon 10 Nov 2025 11.26 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 11.28 ESTShareHow many times a day do you reach for your phone? Do you jump at a notification, spend journeys locked in on your tiny black mirror? What about during meals, or when you wake up? Does it make you feel enriched, alive? I am just as guilty as the next person: swiping, liking, scrolling. But in a world built to distract us, how can we take five or 10 minutes away from that, and instead add something enriching to our lives?I like to look at artists for the answers. They get us to slow down and think about different ways of looking; to notice nature and beauty; time changing in front of us. They remind us of the joys of making, and in a world where AI is attempting to outsource our creativity to machines – the delight of discovering something for ourselves. Artists see the potential in something: like a word that can be joined up into a sentence that can grow into a paragraph, or book; or a tube of paint that can be used to create an image. Not only can these get us to see something from a different perspective, or teach us something about their world, but hold our attention, and invite stillness, too.King’s College London found that witnessing paintings in person lowers stress hormones by 22%It is scientifically proven: a2024 studycommissioned by the UK government found a high volume of evidence that consuming art can improve your mental and physical health – as well as, as Sarah Karlsberg writes, “reduce healthcare costs and increase the country’s productivity”. Last month, King’s College London found that when 50 people aged 18–40 witnessed paintings in person, theirstress hormones dropped by 22%. (Half the group were tested to look at copies: their levels only went down by 8%.)Whatever our situation, art and artists can guide us all. As someone who has always kept the words of creative people close to me – whether for inspiration or reflection, to help me in relationships or structuring my day – I’ve compiled 366 short passages of wisdom for every day of the year in a new book,How to Live an Artful Life.From words by artists including Tracey Emin and Marina Abramović to writers such as Ali Smith and Iris Murdoch, each entry includes reflections, rituals, encouragements, and creative exercises. Guided by the seasons (January’s theme is beginnings; February is love; August is beauty; November is memory), I respond to each passage, bringing the artists’ words to life, so anyone can partake in their creative act.I wrote this book at a time when I was feeling uninspired and distracted. It was reading these artists’ words that lifted me out of a darker place: whether it was learning of the routines of writer Patricia Highsmith who made working life “as pleasurable as possible” by sitting on her bed “surrounded by cigarettes, a mug of coffee, a doughnut …” or, doing as art critic Jerry Saltz advises, when in a museum, to ask the person next to us: “What are you thinking about that?” Conversation can be the greatest starting point for ideas. Museums are historically places for dialogue, debate, community, fostering in-person connection, and, wonderfully, many are free in the UK.View image in fullscreen‘Cigarettes, a mug of coffee, a doughnut’ … writer Patricia Highsmith on making her working life pleasurable.Photograph: Dino Fracchia/AlamyIf you’re feeling overwhelmed, writer Hisham Matar and broadcaster Claudia Winkleman suggest looking at just one painting at a time. Revisit it at different moments, and notice how it changes depending on howyouchange. Or, if you don’t have access to a museum, look something up in a book or online: show it to someone else and ask them, what’s that supposed to be? As Smith told me: “Whenever you stand in front of art, you attend and something in you has been awakened to it.”Why do we look at art? Maybe it’s because, as Paula Rego told her son, the film director Nick Willing: “An artist is someone who goes to a place where no one’s ever been before, but brings back something you’ve never seen but instantly recognise.”Living an “artful life” doesn’t have to mean being an artist. It’s about enriching what you already have, and, as Laurie Anderson advises in an entry in December (a month that takes the theme of joy), focusing on “Whatever makes you feel free and really good.” While wellness industry courses charge extortionate fees, artists like Abramović remind us of the power of sitting still: “Doing nothing is the start of the something.”Be in the world. Talk to people. Go to places, even if it’s not far. Look up into the expanse of the skies rather than into our tech-filtered selves. Take back your attention and give it to each other. The year ahead is a gift. Go out, seize it, and live it, artfully.How to Live an Artful Life: 366 Inspirations from Artists on How to Bring Creativity to Your Everyday by Katy Hessel is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£16.99).

Could a missile fired from the Pacific really reach Chicago in just 18 minutes? Is the decision to retaliate solely in the president’s hands?In particular, the Pentagon has challenged the film’s suggestion that US-launched interceptor missiles have only a 61% success rate at shooting down incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles, insisting that the real figure is 100% in testing. (The nonprofit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferationputs it even lowerthan the film, at 55%.)However, one technological aspect of A House of Dynamite less in dispute – whether or not you are a nuclear expert – is the prominent role mobile phones play in the unfolding crisis. They serve as a touchstone across the film’s three-part narrative, helping ordinary viewers more fully enter an extraordinary situation. After all, whether it’s an iPhone, Android or other model, everyone has their own hotline now.A House of Dynamite is especially authentic in portraying the smartphone, like nuclear energy itself, as a dual-use technology – not so much in the strict sense of having both military and civilian uses, but as one we employ across our personal and professional lives. The phone serves as an instrument of intimate human connection and as the omnipresent avatar of work.The personal aspect is on display throughout, as characters desperately turn to their phones to warn loved ones about the imminent attack. But the movie establishes the centrality of phones in family life even before the characters learn of the missile launch.Near the start of the film, for instance, as Capt Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) leaves for her job monitoring threats in the situation room, she tells her young son: “Mommy’s got her phone.” Here, the phone becomes a symbol of the bond between parent and child.Later, we encounter secretary of defense Reid Baker (Jared Harris) as he takes a condolence call, during an early morning round of golf, about the recent passing of his wife. “We were lucky to have 33 great years,” Baker tells the caller. The phone is a source of consolation.View image in fullscreenWired … Rebecca Ferguson in A House of Dynamite (2025).Photograph: BFA/AlamyWhen we finally meet the president (Idris Elba), he’s in the Oval Office speaking via cellphone to his wife, who is on safari in Kenya. The scene underscores how the device can connect two people, husband and wife, no matter how far apart.In other scenes, by contrast, the phone is cast as a jarring intruder into family life. That’s evident when it interrupts deputy national security adviser Jake Baerington (Gabriel Basso) and his wife as they discuss their future during a traffic jam on the way to work.The phone’s disruptive force is shown even more clearly when the NSA national intelligence officer for North Korea, Ana Park (Greta Lee), is alerted about the launch while attending a civil war reenactment with her young son. In a bit of foreshadowing, her voice can be heard on the line amid gunfire, explosions and other sounds of battle from the reenactment. Park has also wandered away from her son to take the call.There are limits to the blurring of boundaries between the mobile phone’s dual nature, though, especially for high-ranking government officials. That’s highlighted when both Walker and Baerington are, separately, shown relinquishing their devices at a security check as they go into the White House complex. Later, Walker deposits her phone in a secure chamber before entering the situation room.The phone’s flip side, however – as an extension of human bonds – reasserts itself when Walker later breaks security protocol by having her phone smuggled into the situation room so she can warn her husband to evacuate Washington in case it, too, becomes a target. The moment links back to her earlier reassurance to her son about having her phone with her.For all the evidence A House of Dynamite offers about the crucial role mobile phones play in our lives, they can’t heroically save the day. That’s shown most poignantly when Baker calls his daughter in Chicago but gives her no warning as only minutes remain before the city is obliterated. Instead, he tries to smooth over tensions in their relationship, pleased to learn she’s in a serious relationship.View image in fullscreenHand to hand existence … Gabriel Basso as Deputy National Security Advisor Jake Baerington in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixThat sense of futility also resonates on a larger scale. In a scene evoking the storied Washington–Moscow hotline of the cold war, Baerington negotiates with the Russian foreign minister in an emergency bunker beneath the White House. Cell phones have been swapped for more conventional phones. But the tense exchange brings no relief or resolution to the grim scenario.A House of Dynamite is both political fantasy and major disappointment | Mike McCahillRead moreFar from a calamity-averting innovation, the phone in A House of Dynamite becomes an emblem of human limitations. And real events suggest a mobile phone in the wrong hands may be more likely to lead us into a nuclear crisis than out of one. Consider President Trump’s recent post on the Truth Social app announcing that the US wouldresume nuclear weapons testingafter three decades to be on an “equal basis” with Russia and China.Russia responded that it would follow suit if any country resumes nuclear testing. US energy secretary Chris Wright subsequently clarified that the testing would not include actual nuclear explosions but rather “system tests”.If a president had used their mobile phone that recklessly in a nuclear thriller, audiences might find it hard to believe.Explore more on these topicsFilmKathryn BigelowDrama filmsAction and adventure filmsThrillersNetflixSmartphonesShareReuse this content"

Batman v Superman, Godzilla vs Kong, and theAlienvs Predator movies all imagined that the only thing you had to do to get bums on multiplex seats was to pair up two logos with recognisable silhouettes and watch the greenbacks roll in.This new film, though, manages the rare feat of cross-pollinating between two decades-old sci-fi sagas, and somehowadding depth and emotional textureto both. Predator suddenly feels like a space where we discover that even within a society of ritualised trophy violence and hereditary warrior pride, there’s room to rebel. Alien is reimagined as a universe in which synthetic beings aren’t just sinister corporate automata, reprogrammed dolts or soft-voiced laboratory philosophers, but something more familiar: entities who can malfunction in ways that look suspiciously like a soul attempting to coalesce in the digital ether.What emerges is a surprisingly expansive film about rejecting the story you were handed, whether it was coded into your circuitry or screamed at you across generations. A runt Predator decides he will not be his father’s disappointment, a damaged android quietly refuses to spend her remaining operational hours as an obedient instrument of dead-eyed destruction. A monster deciding to hunt is not the point. The result is that rare thing, a franchise film that widens the frame. Here’s how it does it.The mask slips on Yautja PrimeBadlands introduces Dek, a young warrior from an exiled clan. Marked for death by his own father as a runt who will only damage the bloodline, he sets out to redeem himself by hunting and killing the near-legendary Kalisk, an invulnerable monster that is also the apex predator of the dangerously lethal world of Genna.From its opening scene, in which Dek has to watch as his dad decapitates the young Yautja’s brother for allowing him to flee, it’s clear that this is no longer simply the unyielding warrior cult seen in previous films; Predator society is brittle, status-obsessed and terrified of weakness. And, as we find out, it can be rebelled against just as easily as humankind’s.The synthetic who learned to chooseView image in fullscreenRobot wars … Elle Fanning as Thia.Photograph: 20th Century StudiosSoon the film introduces Thia, one of two near-identical Weyland-Yutani androids, played by Elle Fanning. She and her team are on Genna because the Kalisk’s regenerative biology is exactly the sort of weaponisable miracle tissue the corporation believes it can stabilise, study and make cold hard cash from. (Clearly Weyland-Yutani is still meddling in biology it doesn’t understand, centuries after the Ripley-era Alien films and TV show.)Despite initially deceiving Dek so she can be reunited with her mission, her team and, crucially, her severed lower half, Thia is soon doing something no corporate-owned synthetic is supposed to do: acting with apparent humanity. She prioritises Dek’s life over the company’s aims and turns against her own “sister”, cold-eyed twin android Tessa.This is hardly the first time we’ve seen a good-hearted synth in the Alien saga. But unlike, say, David Jonsson’s Andy in Alien: Romulus or Lance Henriksen’s Bishop in Aliens, Thia hasn’t been programmed to act with a conscience. So what’s going on here? Is director Dan Trachtenberg suggesting that the very process of breaking down has handed her a moral code? Does it tell us something intriguing about artificial intelligence? Or is it simply the creeping Disneyfication of Alien, where even your corporate murder-droids are contractually obliged to have a warm emotional centre and a hug-arc?The Kalisk is not the monsterView image in fullscreenChasing monsters? … Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi as Dek.Photograph: 20th Century Studios/APBadlands sets up Genna’s ‘big bad’ as something terrible, a monster so unstoppable that bringing home its head represents Dek’s last chance to prove his worth to Yautja society. But the film’s key reveal is not that the creature can regenerate; it’s that it can care. The Kalisk doesn’t stalk, taunt or toy with prey. It doesn’t have a corporate aesthetic and it isn’t really hunting anyone. Instead, its prime instinct is to protect. The moment the enormous creature pauses, registers the scent of its child on Dek and chooses not to kill him is the moment the film quietly flips its own narrative arc into reverse. Our hero hasn’t been chasing a monster; he has been harassing a parent. Yautja society appears to teach that strength and honour can only be proved by capturing or killing those weaker than oneself. But the toughest creature it has ever come across is only interested in love.Genna is not PandoraView image in fullscreenFormidable team … Thia and Dek.Photograph: 20th Century Studios/APIt’s easy to see why some critics have looked at the Kalisk’s homeworld – with its intricate predator-prey hierarchies and flora that behaves like a planetary self-defence system – and made comparisons with Avatar. But there is nothing wise and mystical about this relentless and indifferent kill-or-be-killed biome. Genna isn’t teaching lessons or nurturing souls; it’s just trying to survive. If the Yautja are out to prove themselves as the universe’s greatest hunters, the planet is out to remind them that Genna barely noticed they arrived and has already begun the process of returning them to mulch. This is a closed loop where everything eats and is eaten in turn.When Dek adapts his weapons to mimic the planet’s biology, it is a practical submission to a system that could not care less about him. It’s also the moment he begins to realise there are relationships other than the one between hunter and prey, leading to the film’s finale in which Dek arrives home with his new “family” to take revenge on his dad. Did you buy this sudden perspective shift or did it feel like the film is opportunistically looking up from the cosmic gore and machismo of the previous hour to say: “Actually, we have a message”?A universe defined by the importance of free willView image in fullscreen‘A creature does what it must’ – Predator: Badlands.Photograph: 20th Century Studios. All Rights Reserved./PAMuch has been made of the potential for Badlands to spark a new shared Alien/Predator continuity, with Trachtenberg admitting in interviews to having been inspired by Marvel. And yet if the film offers a way for these universes to coexist, it’s by aligning their worldviews. Predator films have always centred on dominance, hierarchy and the blood-stained meritocracy of the “worthy” hunter. Alien, by contrast, has traditionally insisted that biology is fate: a creature does what it must, a company does what it will, and everyone else gets crunched. Badlands destabilises all of this. It suggests that a trophy-beast can be a parent, a synthetic can be disobedient and a born-and-bred hunter can simply walk away.By the end of the film, the Kalisk is someone’s mum, Dek has abandoned his entire civilisation and Thia fancies anything over the prospect of returning to corporate servitude. We are not defined by others – we decide our own identities, and that might just be a mantra worthy of cutting through all cultures, whether human, alien, android or gigantic, death-defying apex megafauna. Or maybe Trachtenberg just killed both Alien and Predator franchises by nonchalantly jumping the shark straight into the mythological glue that was holding both together.

In a dramatic turn of events, Burns was first to be caught and banished in the vote, then Marler was wrongly identified as a traitor and banished too.The three remaining players voted to end the game, after which Carr revealed he was a traitor, adding: “I’m so sorry, it’s been tearing me apart.” Afive-star Guardian reviewcalled the finale an “absolute blinder”.Among some of the more high-profile names on the first season were the actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry, the actor Celia Imrie, the Olympian Tom Daley, the singer-songwriter Paloma Faith, and the chatshow host Jonathan Ross.Popular moments in the series included Imre audibly passing wind during one of the missions, and Carr murdering his friend Faith in plain sight at the first opportunity.In the show, which began with 19 celebrities, contestants try to detect the traitors in the group while completing a series of challenges to win funds to contribute towards the prize pot. If at the end of the series a traitor is left among the finalists, the faithfuls, those who are not traitors, would lose out on the money and the traitor would win the full prize.Stars who could appear in season twoGareth Southgate– The former England manager is a fan of the show and previously revealed that the England team and staff played their own version during their free time at the Qatar World Cup in 2022. Asked by Chris Evans on Virgin Radio if he would ever sign up for the celebrity series, Southgate coyly replied: “Well ...”Danny Dyer– The actor said he turned down a request to appear on the first series, but has since changed his mind. Speaking on the Live and Let Dyers podcast, he said: “They did sniff around me about it. It was a ‘no’ because, for one, I hadn’t seen it, but now I’m into it … If the money’s right, I might get involved in the next series.”Alison Hammond and Dermot O’Leary– After the finale, the ITV This Morning hosts said they would both consider appearing in a second series. Asked if she would rather be a faithful or traitor, Hammond replied: “I’m not going to tell you that, just in case I do it.”A fan posted on X: “Season two with Alison Hammond needed NOW.”Mike Tindall –The former rugby star, who is married to Princess Anne’s daughter, Zara Tindall, expressed his interest in joining the show during a chat on the TV show This Morning. After viewing a snippet of the programme, he told the presenters Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard: “Having watched that, I think I would definitely enjoy doing that.”Bob Mortimer –After the comedian’s name was in the mix for the initial series, Mortimer said it was “the only show of its kind on TV that I would agree to get involved with.” The show’s executive producer, Sarah Fay, told Metro last month: “If Bob wanted to do it next year, we would absolutely love it.”Ruth Jones –The Gavin & Stacey star is rumoured to be “in talks to appear”, though it is claimed she would consider taking part only on the proviso she would be a faithful.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

And while financial pressures remain, a host of other, smaller venues are bringing in vibrant new audiences.“I’ll have been doing this for 50 years next year and, to be honest, I’ve seen quite a few ‘resurgences’,” says Steve Rubie, owner of the606 Clubin Chelsea. But, he adds, there’s something genuinely different today. “Younger audiences are less scared of jazz. It’s all just music to them.”That open-mindedness and freedom has been powering London’s globally famous jazz scene over the last decade, as young musicians who were learning their craft atTomorrow’s Warriorsand the city’s music schools also cut their teeth in clubs, from late-night jams at Ronnie Scott’s to the improvised jazz parties of Steam Down events – all of it attracting an equally cosmopolitan audience.Those artists includedEzra Collective, who have won the Mercury prize and played Wembley Arena, and that kind of success is rooted in jazz clubs, “the heartbeat of the jazz scene” according to Aisling Doherty, programming coordinator at the EFG London jazz festival, which is back for its 33rd year this week. A strand of concerts at the festival celebrating the jazz club seeks to “honour the spaces who work day in and day out” to make London’s scene thrive, says Doherty.View image in fullscreenPerformers at Toulouse Lautrec jazz club, Kennington.Photograph: (no credit)At Ronnie Scott’s, the most famous of these London venues, straight-ahead jazz in the afternoon might attract more traditional listeners than the twenty- and thirtysomethings who would come out for a late show featuring live remixing and broken beat. But atToulouse Lautrecin Kennington, the classics of the genre are finding new fans. “Young people are keen to learn more about the history behind the music,” says manager Nolan Regent, who notes the popularity of their “the music of” series, which explores the work of iconic figures from jazz history. “I love that they’re listening to older styles of jazz.”And as jazz audiences grow, so are the city’s clubs. TheJazzCafe is extending into a neighbouring building, and in May was granted planning permission to transform an art deco theatre in Stratford into a new outpost. Ronnie Scott’s has completely renovated its upstairs space into a new small venue, which will open in February; its green room will double as a members’ bar, where performers and audiences can mingle after a gig, complete with a piano for impromptu jams.Blue Note is coming to Covent Garden in 2026, overcoming fears from police and local residents that its 1am closing time could result in an “uptick in crime” in the area – perpetrated against, rather than by, jazz fans. But the late licence was granted in May, and the space, in the basement of the St Martin’s Lane Hotel, is now being renovated to accommodate two performance spaces and a kitchen.While these prominent clubs arrive or expand, grassroots music venues in the UK are “facing a crisis of soaring costs and closures”, according to thegovernment’s cross-party Culture, Media and Sport Committee; research by theMusic Venue Trust(MVT) found that nearly half of grassroots venues were running at a loss last year.View image in fullscreenRonnie Scott’s new upstairs space, Upstairs at Ronnie’s.Photograph: Ronnie Scott’sMany are still struggling to recover from the period of closure necessitated by Covid, and London’s jazz clubs are no exception.Vortexin Dalston turned tocrowdfundingin 2020 to remain afloat and, like many venues, relies on volunteers. Kansas Smitty’s on Broadway Market closed during the pandemic and never reopened. The small basement space was a dynamic setting for the house band’s lively swinging – and the very opposite of social distancing. But for clarinettist and saxophonist Giacomo Smith, who co-founded the venue in 2015, the decision not to reopen wasn’t purely financial. “You only have one career – and for me, I want to play,” he says. “I don’t think musicians should start jazz clubs, just like I don’t think chefs should start restaurants. Because they care too much. At the end of the day, it has to be a business that works.”Add to playlist: the spiky, playful free jazz of Laura Ann Singh and the week’s best new tracksRead moreThe cross-party committee has suggested introducing a ticket levy on arena-level live music events – whether voluntary, and administered by an organisation such as the MVT, or government-run, as hasexisted in France since the 1980s– to feed money back into grassroots venues that are vital to musicians’ artistic development and their ability to make a living, and where “there’s an electricity … between the musicians and the audience”, says Smith. In small venues, Rubie adds, “being a member of an audience is as important as being a member of the band. It’s a joint venture.”At a time of polarisation, there’s renewed value to the intimate, dimly lit rooms where veteran jazz disciples rub shoulders with young, diverse new fans in the name of the music they love. So what can people do to support local clubs? “Visit them regularly!” says Rubie, adding that it’s also helpful to show venues support on social media. Regent says that he sees lots of people coming to gigs on their own. “Bring a friend,” he suggests. “Music should bring people together.”TheEFG London jazz festivalis on 14-23 November.Upstairs at Ronnie’sreopens on 6 February.Explore more on these topicsJazzLondon jazz festivalLondonMusic industryMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now she’s back – and she hasn’t mellowed with ageMon 10 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTShare‘Things haven’t changed,” sighs Eve Libertine as she contemplates her new album. “All those songs are as relevant as they ever were.” The album in question, Live at the Horse Hospital, shows no sign that one of punk’s most anti-establishment figures is mellowing with age. Recorded at one blistering London live show in April 2024, Libertine collaborated with Chilean guitarist Eva Leblanc, reimagining tracks from Libertine’s back catalogue including ones from her time singing with 1970s anarcho-punk pioneers Crass. Produced by Crass founder Penny Rimbaud, it treads a path between performance art, experimental music and earth ritual; with her strident operatic tones, Libertine sounds like a soothsayer foretelling an apocalypse. It’s not an easy listen, but that was never the case with Crass, either.“We never had much fun, to be honest,” Libertine says. “It was really heavy going at times. We were angry; we were trying to say things in a way that was confrontational and shocking to get a reaction. And we definitely did.”Speaking on a video call from her living room, Libertine is good humoured, offering up stern opinions then laughing as she says them, like a chuckling assassin. She describes how Rimbaud’s lyrics to the track Rocky Eyes came from the band’s anti-nuclear activism leading her to see wastelands everywhere: “Looking at a tree and seeing it as …” She pauses on each word for emphasis: “A. Dead. Burned. Stump.” Then another sudden laugh.View image in fullscreenConfrontational … Libertine performing with Crass.Photograph: Courtesy: Eve LibertineThat sense of provocation and absurdity defined Crass, formed as a shouty agit-punk band in the 70s in the Dial House farm commune in Essex. The nucleus was Rimbaud on drums and Steve Ignorant on vocals, with further members added from the commune. Eve herself started out as a fan at their gigs, “which used to empty out. There was one where I was the only person left in the audience, pogoing alone in front of the stage.” By the late 70s she had moved into the commune and taken up a place in the band, adding a scorching vocal cadence that, along with the increasingly varied musical tastes of the other members, pulled them into more avant garde territory, as likely to release seething, abstract sonic collages as they were 1-2-3-4 punk thrashers.Crass were also politically radical, and several cases were brought against them in the 70s and 80s, first for blasphemy for the 1978 track Reality Asylum, with Scotland Yard’s vice squad raiding Dial House, before dropping the case. Later, their 1983 Falklands protest How Does It Feel (To Be the Mother of 1,000 Dead) prompted Tory MP Timothy Eggar to try (and eventually fail) to prosecute them under the obscene publications act.When I see what women are doing to themselves with tucks and silicon … sadly that line could have been written todayHowever, a 1981 charge of obscenity brought by Manchester police stuck to Bata Motel, one of the songs Libertine has decided to revisit on Live at the Horse Hospital. The charge was initially made against the album Penis Envy, copies of which were seized from Manchester record shops. A judge eventually upheld the charge against Bata Motel alone, deeming it “sexually provocative and obscene”.“Much to Penny’s chagrin,” Eve laughs again. “He would have liked to be prosecuted, and in the end it was me who was.”The track, a detailed depiction of living as a woman under the male gaze, was accused of being sadomasochistic pornography. Libertine didn’t bother attending the court hearing, but remembers what happened. “It was hilarious. The defence was using an album Peter Cook and Dudley Moore had got away with – it was about Jesus wanking or something – and played it in court. Of course, everyone was in hysterics. The judge said very sternly: ‘If anyone else laughs you’ll be in the cells!’ And so there was biting of lips and coughing fits.” She calls the episode “all a bit of a joke,” though the band ended up incurring heavy fines for the song.Libertine herself argues that Bata Motel is “quite the opposite” of sadomasochistic, and that its lyrics have become, if anything, more resonant with a younger generation of women. “I study myself in your reflection, and put it to rights with savage correction,” Eve quotes. “When I see what women are doing to themselves with tucks and silicon, and injections, facelifts at a young age … sadly that line could have been written today.”While she feels that the ills she has railed against since the 70s have remained – “warmongers, devastation, fucking the earth” – her proposed solutions have shifted somewhat and, surprisingly, she doesn’t call herself a feminist.“Our ideologies can hold us back,” she says. “I don’t call myself anything with an -ist on the end, because it can be co-opted. A lot of these movements, people have isolated themselves and that’s very sad. We’re all very armoured. Don’t see the armour, see underneath: we’re human beings under everything. When I look at my own fears and pettiness, my ego, I just want to see it for what it is and, in doing that, hopefully somehow see beyond it.”She thinks about what lies beyond that, and what still drives her art. “Anger. Anger, compassion, rage – and love.”Explore more on these topicsPunkExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Born in 1886, she studied with Stanford, worked with Vaughan Williams and, as a virtuoso violist, became one of the first professional female orchestral players in London. Relocating to the United States, her output declined, but her spirited chamber music and more recently her rediscovered songs, have proved fertile ground for today’s performers.In a deftly curated programme, the culmination of aWigmore HallClarke study day, youthful compositions rubbed shoulders with music from her most productive period, the 1920s. Ailish Tynan opened proceedings, her soaring soprano and snappy diction illuminating songs that suggested the influence of Vaughan Williams. Ravel, in Orientalist mode, hovered over settings of Chinese poetry, perfect material for Kitty Whately’s fresh, flaming mezzo-soprano with its cushioned lower register. Ashley Riches’ warm baritone embraced Clarke’s memorable melody for Yeats’ Down by the Salley Gardens while raising a smile in The Aspidistra, a melodramatic song about the calculated murder of a pot plant.American tenor Nicholas Phan lent his bright, lyric instrument and an expressive stillness to a handful of early German songs and brought an understated sensuality to The Cherry-Blossom Wand (Clarke once described the dividing line between music and sex as “so tenuous as to be almost non-existent”). Max Baillie was a sensitive guide to the masterly viola sonata, plunging into the heady waters of the rhapsodic outer movements and relishing the jiggery-pokery of the fleet-footed central scherzo. Anna Tilbrook was a poetic and authoritative guide throughout. Not every composition here was of purest gold, but the hit rate was remarkably high.Clarke’s best-known song is The Seal Man, a John Masefield setting in which a young woman is drawn to her death by a mysterious figure from out of the sea. Performed in a new arrangement for voice, piano and viola, Whately was spellbinding. Tynan, a singer in her absolute prime, was a hard act to beat, however. Accompanied by Baillie on violin, she brought delicacy, wit and an idiomatic tang to the scintillating Three Irish Country Songs.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

The poet who wrote punk into existence before pivoting to pop stardom then ghosting fans to raise a family has, in the 21st century, leaned into literature and music with such vitality it has become hard to say which medium suits her better. It hardly matters. At 78 years old, Smith lives and breathes both.Her latest memoir follows the tightly focused coming-of-age story Just Kids, published to great acclaim in 2010, and 2015’s more ruminative M Train. Bread of Angels splits the difference to create a more conventional autobiography. It could be described asJust Kids’ prequel and sequel, moving from Smith’s hardscrabble childhood to the near-present, where a striking twist takes the narrative back to her literal conception. It’s one of a number of revelations about an artist whose story would otherwise seem, by now, well-chiseled into the tablets of rock history.But surprises don’t feel crucial to a work that builds its world as much through narrative voice as its description of events. That voice can take some getting used to. Oddly formal, even archaic, in tone, at times unrestrained if not undisciplined, Smith’s literary mind is a wild mare. It can occasionally feel repetitive or self‑indulgent. But once you settle in, it casts a potent spell, and you’ll learn as much about the artist from her style as from the stories themselves.The book begins with a Proustian invocation, flickering between present and distant past, Smith confessing her outsider desire to “disguise the miniature Quasimodo trapped inside an awkward child’s body”, and introducing a recurrent metaphor, her “rebel hump” – a sort of holy flaw she comes to accept, harness and ride.Like many of us, she romanticises her childhood; 70 pages in, she’s still just 10 years old. She idolises her father, a damaged second world war vet who takes factory jobs to support his young family, moving them from a Philadelphia rooming house into nearly condemned government housing. They relocate 12 times before settling into a modest new development in rural south Jersey.Smith was a sickly child. Diagnosed with TB, she was sent to Chattanooga to quarantine and recuperate with relatives. In response to her metaphysical inquiries, they enrolled her in Presbyterian Sunday school. She yearned to create; she recalls her “outstretched fingers trying to reach the ivory keys” of her grandmother’s “glowing spinet”, and she kept diaries scrupulously. She’d disappear into reveries – in one story, she was waylaid by a tortoise en route to school and absent-mindedly lost the morning communing with it. She found similar escape in vividly imagined playtimes with sister Linda, younger by 11 months, and little brother Todd. “As our parents grappled with an uncertain fate, we practised oblivion,” she writes, among many singing sentences; “the future was a grownup concern.”She and her sister Linda discover something about their lineage that stops time, realigning the architecture of a remarkable lifeThere’s an awful lot of rambling through woods and yards, waiting for destiny to descend. It does, and you see the rebel artist being born in stop-motion. Smith refuses to salute the American flag in school, per the Jehovah’s Witness teachings her mother introduced her to. On her first trip to an art museum, Picasso and Modigliani light up her imagination. So do encounters with films (Lost Horizon), music (the Shirelles’ Will You Love Me Tomorrow, the album Another Side of Bob Dylan), and literature (Wilde’s The Selfish Giant, Rimbaud’s Illuminations). When art and religion inevitably clash, she chooses sides. “I was told that there was no place for art in Christ’s Kingdom,” she writes of an exchange with a church elder, “and I was counseled to consider what I truly believed in. But I knew what I believed in.”The tipping point comes when 19-year-old Smith announces she’s pregnant and, in solidarity, her brother confesses his own gender non-conformity. Smith gives her child up for adoption, heads to New York City, and begins the life chronicled in Just Kids. Those years, and her profound relationship with soulmate Robert Mapplethorpe, fly by in a blur here, the book’s tempo shifting from ramble to gallop. Her romance with Sam Shepard. Her debut at St Mark’s Church with guitarist Lenny Kaye. The touchstone CBGB residency. We learn that Dylan invited her to join the fabled Rolling Thunder Revue, then bumped her off the lineup on opening night. She hints at a love triangle between herself, actor Maria Schneider and billionaire Paul Getty. She recounts her principled knack for shooting herself in the foot commercially (refusing to alter the lyrics to “Pissing in a River” for radio, or to lip-sync “Because the Night” on American Bandstand). A final show for 80,000 Italian fans, and a pre-retirement counselling session with William S Burroughs, mark her 1979 exit from the public eye.The pace slows as Smith heads off to Michigan with MC5 guitarist Fred Smith. They live a bohemian love story: making their home in an abandoned hotel, refurbishing an old boat, travelling to far-flung artistic landmarks, money evidently available if not outrageously plentiful. They marry with just their parents in attendance. They have kids; she does laundry, and she writes. The narrative is radiant and intimate, but guarded. “The trials and challenges that Fred and I suffered were our own,” she writes elliptically in one moving passage, alluding to her husband’s health, his drug history, and whatever marital troubles they endured, declaring “his decline was the tragedy of my life”. A transcendent sequence that follows – like those moments in her songs when poetic incantation takes flight – displays her eccentric writing style not as a tic but a superpower.Fred Smith’s passing from heart failure in 1994 is followed by a cascade of other losses, deaths that trigger a creative rebirth. Michael Stipe cold-calls her (“confessing he was somewhat intoxicated”), jump-starting a long friendship. Allen Ginsberg urges her to return to the stage. Longtime comrade Tom Verlaine joins her band for a comeback tour. Dylan invites her to open some shows, and to singa magnificent duet, Dark Eyes. She captures that moment with her childhood hero indelibly: “I was somewhat nervous as Bob called me to the stage. I began the verse, and we sang the chorus together on the same microphone, our faces nearly touching. I could see tiny beads of sweat on his forehead and caught the intensity in his eyes. I gripped my dress and looked down at my bare feet, and for that moment I was just a widow and the raging young poet who once dominated my teenage senses, was just a man.”There are new albums, endless tours, books, awards, a doubling down on activism. And as the narrative spins into an elegantly diaristic laundry list, she and her sister Linda discover something about their lineage that stops time, realigning the architecture of a remarkable life. It’s a beautiful moment of storytelling. Yet her DNA doesn’t change what the book has already made plain – that the Patti Smith we know gave birth to herself. She sang herself into being. She’s written – is still writing – her own story.Will Hermes is author ofLou Reed: The King of New Yorkand Love Goes to Buildings on Fire: Five Years in New York That Changed Music For Ever.

Visit The Mousetrap, says bold new director of West End perennialOla Ince, who has refreshed Agatha Christie’s record-breaking mystery, says ‘we all fancy ourselves as detectives’Chris WiegandStage editorMon 10 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 02.02 ESTShareAudiences left hungry for more suspense after thenail-biting Celebrity Traitors finaleshould visit the ultimate murder mystery, The Mousetrap, its new director has suggested.Ola Ince has taken charge of Agatha Christie’s indomitable whodunnit, the world’s longest-running play, which is in its 73rd year in London’s West End. The director, acclaimed for her bracing takes on Shakespeare, said Christie’s drama about a group of strangers snowed in at a remote guesthouse with a killer at large is “juicier” than she had previously imagined.“In life we all fancy ourselves as detectives,” said Ince. “She creates such nuanced and quirky characters that you want to get to know them and figure out whodunnit. It’s full of intrigue and mischief, funny as well as thrilling. Shows likeThe Traitorsand Only Murders in the Building are really popular right now. This is the original for people who want to lock in and see the real deal.”View image in fullscreenNicky Goldie as Mrs Boyle and Joshua Riley as Christopher Wren in rehearsals for Ola Ince’s production of The Mousetrap.Photograph: Danny KaanInce, 36, said that when she directs a classic play such asOthello,Romeo and JulietorArthur Miller’s The Crucible, all of which she staged for Shakespeare’s Globe, “what I’m contending with is tradition and what you inherit from a show. This feels similar – this show is older than me and audiences really feel like they know exactly what it is. I’m coming along and not taking it for granted. Before I worked on the show, I thought I knew exactly what kind of evening it was.”She discovered, instead, that Christie was a deft and perhaps overlooked commentator on postwar class structure. “With John Osborne, everyone spoke about how radical it was having working-class people on stage doing mundane things like ironing [in Look Back in Anger, which premiered in London a few years after The Mousetrap]. But at the top of Act 1 Scene 2 she’s got [proprietor of the guesthouse] Mollie Ralston hoovering. That was pretty radical too! It’s easy to forget that she’s commenting on changes that are happening hierarchically. The upper classes are falling away and there’s this want for equity … the play says a lot about injustice and the change that needed to happen.”View image in fullscreenSusan Penhaligon, Paul Hilliar, Derek Griffiths, Danny Mac and David Rintoul in The Mousetrap when it reopened in 2021 after its Covid-19 closure.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhen The Mousetrap opened in 1952, theWest Endcast included Richard Attenborough as the detective alongside the actor’s wife, Sheila Sim, as Mollie. The first director was Peter Cotes. Later directors included David Turner who worked on the show in different capacities for 30 years. Ince has taken over from Philip Franks. The Mousetrap also has an overseeing artistic director, Denise Silvey, who played the role of Miss Casewell in 1994 and 2001.A new cast begins performances under Ince’s direction on Monday night. Among the changes that Ince has introduced to “heighten what already exists” is a sound design by Max Perryment “to enhance the psychology of the play and the thrill of it”. The production accordingly has new speakers, the furniture has been rearranged and Ince has returned to Christie’s original manuscript and author’s notes. Balancing the comic with the serious is one of the main challenges, said its new director.The Mousetrap has been overwhelmingly directed by men although Phyllida Lloyd staged a 60th anniversary gala. “She’s my theatre mum,” said Ince with a laugh. Ince was the international associate director on theTina Turner musicaldirected by Lloyd in the West End. “We’ve had some nice chats about The Mousetrap.”View image in fullscreenAlfred Enoch and Rebekah Murrell in Ola Ince’s production of Romeo and Juliet at Shakespeare’s Globe in 2021.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe show has clocked up more than 30,000 performances since its premiere, its run temporarily halted only by Covid-19. Like many of Christie’s novels, which have had offensive language around gender and race removed by sensitivity readers, the script has been revised over the years. “I’ve come into a version of the play that omits some of the more hostile language, some old-fashioned sexism. But at the same time I’m cautious of erasing too much because it’s true of the time,” said Ince. “I don’t want to offend an audience but if you make everyone a bit squeaky clean then you’re avoiding that maybe someone’s an arsehole and that’s interesting – or that can be a red herring. You’ve got to be careful that you’re not making it all a bit bland.”Since 2017, a production of Christie’s Witness for the Prosecution has run in a courtroom setting insideCounty Hall in London. But people still classify Christie primarily as a novelist, said Ince. “I’d love people to celebrate her more as a playwright.” At times, over The Mousetrap’s extraordinary run, it has been the only play by a female playwright in the West End. She’s still in a minority now although Kate Trefry has had a hit withStranger Things: The First Shadowand Suzie Miller’sInter Aliais coming soon. “I think there are peaks and troughs when it feels like the world is a bit spicier because there’s more diversity,” said Ince. “Then it kind of dissipates because they’ve done that for a season. It’s amazing that Agatha has been strong for so long but sad that we’re still not really achieving [greater equality] now – or doing it in dribs and drabs.”The Mousetrap’s producer, Brian Fenty, said he was “thrilled” about Ince directing the show, which has run at St Martin’s theatre since 1974 (it was previously at the Ambassadors next door). “Ola is a force of nature – a director who understands what it means to be both a steward of history and a challenger of complacency. Her creative instinct is first-class, and her care and love for Agatha Christie’s world is as heartening as it is inspiring.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreOla InceWest EndAgatha ChristieCrime fictionFictionThe TraitorsnewsShareReuse this content"

She did this supremely, of course, in Willy Russell’s Shirley Valentine, the one-woman play in which I directed her in the West End and on Broadway. This performance was so natural, so deftly balanced between innate cheekiness and a devastating awareness that her life was about to pass her by, that many people assumed it was effortless.On the contrary: she found it hugely challenging. Though she knew the play was a masterpiece, the prospect of doing it filled her with dread. Rehearsals were far from easy. The play is essentially a comic monologue and calls for very particular skills not possessed by all actors. I forced the poor woman to come into rehearsal every day and tell a new joke – torture for her, second nature to Shirley. Then there was the matter of getting her to credibly cook egg and chips while telling the story of her life. I knew she had to get all of that – the jokes and the chips – into her bones before she could stand before us as a three-dimensional person telling us deep truths about her life and the lives of millions of other women, all the while preparing the evening meal. As she struggled, Willy Russell began to have doubts about having cast her. “She’ll be fine,” he said, “but she won’t be Shirley.”At the first preview, the onstage lights suddenly crashed after three minutes. Out of the dark came the voice of Shirley Valentine: “Hey! Wha’s going on? I paid me electric bills, right up to date.” Huge laughter from an audience that realised she was improvising, a thing she had dreaded all her acting life. Willy grasped my arm in the dark and whispered urgently: “She’s got it. That’s pure Shirley. There’s nothing to worry about.”View image in fullscreenImmense range … Pauline Collins with Ben Chapman in Shades at the Albery theatre, London, in 1992, directed by Simon Callow.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyIn life, she was irresistible: kind, outrageous, sexy, loving, wickedly funny. We first met when I was cast opposite her in Bernard Slade’s RomanticComedy. The director invited us both to supper. “So, you’re a poofter, then, are you?” she said, before I sat down. I confessed that I was. “Good, right,” she said briskly. “Got that out of the way.”Both in London and in New York, she spread love and naughtiness throughout the theatre; every day was a party. Even those gnarled, cussed old backstageBroadwaycrews adored her. After a few triumphant months she left the New York production in a blur of emotion, her Tony award in her luggage. Days later, her successor having now taken over, the atmosphere backstage and front of house had changed totally, now functional and impersonal again.Her range was immense, much greater than she admitted to. I directed her again in Shades, a superb new play by Sharman Macdonald in which she played a woman whose husband has died young, leaving her in charge of their son, who does everything he can to stop her from committing herself to another man. It was a painful and complex relationship which she played with devastating honesty, to the acclaim of critics and to full houses.But, for reasons which I never completely understood, she hated doing it. So there was no point now in my trying to persuade her to play the lead in Seán O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock or Willy Loman’s wife, Linda, in Death of a Salesman. Never mind: what she did as Shirley and on screen in countless witty and brilliantly subtle performances was gift enough. What she gave to those of us who got to know her privately, as well as her audiences, remains an ineffaceable memory.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWilly RussellWest EndComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Simon CallowBroadwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A lot of actors do say that, which can sound like shite sometimes, but I genuinely do mean it. I feel more at home on stage than I do in life and I don’t know why that is at all.”Lowden’s films have included Mary Queen of Scots (2018) with Saoirse Ronan, whom he later married, and Benediction (2021), as the war poet Siegfried Sassoon. On TV, he is best known for appearing alongside Gary Oldman in Slow Horses, based on Mick Herron’s spy fiction. Lowden was speaking alongside Ireland and director Finn den Hertog at an Edinburgh screening of the NT Live capture of The Fifth Step, which was filmed at @sohoplace in London.The film is released in cinemas on 27 November.“Watching that was very strange – that’s the first time I’ve ever seen anything of myself on stage,” said Lowden in the discussion. Reflecting on seeing his stage performance, he joked: “I can only apologise for not really having an arse!” The Fifth Step was “the most actor-friendly play I’ve ever done … or seen,” continued Lowden, who suggested that was because both its playwright and director have worked as actors themselves.View image in fullscreenLesley Manville and Jack Lowden in Ghosts at Trafalgar Studios, London, in 2014.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn his early 20s, Lowden starred in the National Theatre of Scotland’s Black Watch.

The Fifth Step was his first play sinceMeasure for Measureat the Donmar Warehouse in 2018, staged by Josie Rourke (who also directed the film Mary Queen of Scots).The Fifth Step review – Jack Lowden and Martin Freeman go head to headRead moreLowden said that when he takes on a play, “I don’t really care what the thing’s about to a certain extent … I just care about the character and if the character’s worth playing”. The Fifth Step, co-produced by theNational Theatre of Scotland, was “a play written for two actors to sort of go mad and really push each other every single night”, he added.His character in The Fifth Step is Luka, who is new to Alcoholics Anonymous and asks the older James (Martin Freeman) to be his sponsor. The drama unfolds on the verge of theconfessional stagein AA’s 12-step programme, with Luka expected to acknowledge the harm his addiction has done to himself and others.Recognising the serious issues raised by the dark comedy, Lowden said: “There’s no point in doing [these issues] in a play unless it is, first and foremost, entertaining. No one should sit in the dark for an hour and 15 minutes and never laugh. I think that’s robbing people of their money.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreJack LowdenDavid IrelandComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)AlcoholismTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

This could be the start of a partnership as enduring as Bert and Ernie’sStuart HeritageMon 10 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 10.41 ESTShareAn entire generation of British adults was raised bySesame Street. They’re easy enough to spot; they’re kind, they have had that Pointer Sisters pinball counting song as an earworm for four decades, and they were repeatedly told off at school for pronouncing the final letter of the alphabet “zee”.But this generation is old. The last time Sesame Street was regularly broadcast in the UK was September 2001, when Channel 4 made the decision to replace it with The Hoobs. However, this all changes now. Because Sesame Street has just rolled out on Netflix for the first time.This is undoubtedly a good thing. More than almost any other children’s show, Sesame Street seemed to crack the code on how to simultaneously educate and entertain children. Lessons about early phonics and mathematics have always been folded into madcap, brightly coloured sketches, like thewarring two-headed monsterthat teaches you to share, or the monomaniacal numerical egotism ofthe Count(official name: Count von Count).Pinball Number Count by the Pointer Sisters.But this has always been shot through with a sunny humanist outlook on life that delivered messages on everything from patience and cooperation tohow to cope with death. If you watched Sesame Street as a child, it was a fundamental building block of who you’d grow up to become.That said, if you are British and feel raised by Sesame Street, you’re in a narrow age range. Upon its creation, the BBC roundly refused to air it, claiming that the corporation already made superior educational programming, and that Sesame Street’s approach was ‘didactic’. At the time Monica Sims, the head of children’s broadcasting at the BBC, even went as far as calling Sesame Street “indoctrination, and a dangerous extension of the use of television.” Instead, the show would air fitfully on regional ITV franchises until Channel 4 picked it up from 1987 until 2001. Happily, the BBC did eventually come around on Sesame Street; the popular CBeebies show Furchester Hotel is a spin-off that features many of the same characters.More impressive, though, is the programme’s ability to endure. From its very conception, Sesame Street’s stated aim – to offer high-quality educational television to preschool children of all backgrounds – faced stiff resistance. In 1970 its depiction of a racially integrated US spooked the (all white) Mississippi State Commission for EducationalTelevisionso much that it voted to ban the show from the state’s airwaves, until a public outcry forced a reversal three weeks later.Even then, Sesame Street would face battles, both financial and ideological, that often left it teetering on the brink of extinction. Initially the show’s production was federally underwritten, but the Reagan administration’s 1981 budget cuts effectively ended that support.After another decade and a half of receiving smaller grants from the Department of Education, Sesame Street then had to bite the bullet and fill the funding gap by taking on commercial partners, which have variously included cereal brands, fast food companies and pharmaceutical multinationals. The backlash to this was fierce, especially since the creators had previously taken pride in the programme’s lack of advertising, but it rode out the controversy by reiterating that the brands had no say in the content of the show itself.View image in fullscreenOscar the Grouch’s iconic trash can has been joined by a recycling bin.Photograph: NetflixIn 2015, Sesame Street’s quest for survival took it behind a paywall for the first time, as it struck a deal with HBO to air there first before episodes would roll out on free-to-air PBS after a few months. Again, this drew protests – critics claimed it undermined its public good ethos – but again, the programme-makers argued that this sort of deal was the only way it could survive in a changing landscape.But worse was to come. This year, Sesame Street hit two huge roadblocks. First, the show’s deal with Warner Bros (owner of HBO) lapsed, leaving it potentially homeless. And then, in May, Donald Trump issued an executive order to block federal funding for PBS, citing “biased and partisan news coverage”.It might be worth pointing out at this stage that Trump isn’t exactly a stranger to Sesame Street. For its 25th anniversary special in 1994, Joe Pesci appeared on the show as a violent property magnate namedRonald Grump, while in the mid-2000s the show briefly introduced a character calledDonald Grump, who was greedy and mean and lived in a golden dustbin (“He happens to have the most trash of any grouch in the world!”).View image in fullscreenGonger (left) and Cookie Monster in a new episode of Sesame Street.Photograph: NetflixEither way, on paper, Netflix seems like the perfect landing place for Sesame Street. The streamer will have rights to the show for the next two years, during which it will be comfortably funded with no advertisements, and still air on PBS. Netflix also has more than 300 million subscribers worldwide, which means a global audience will get to experience the show for the first time in years. Realistically, this could be the second coming of Sesame Street that we all deserve.Obviously nothing is perfect, and if the current media landscape has taught us anything, it’s that tech giants can dismantle legacy brands on a whim. But this is Sesame Street. A show that has spent seven decades at the vanguard of educational television, teaching millions of children about the value of friendship and cooperation, would not want us to think so pessimistically about the state of the world. So let’s put our worries aside and say: long live Sesame Street, at least for now.Sesame Street is now available on Netflix worldwide, as well as PBS Kids in the USExplore more on these topicsTelevisionSesame StreetChildren's TVfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sink snugly into the cushioning and make notes between naps.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The tricky part is testing the supportiveness of a pillow in bumpy motion. You never know when you’re going to encounter rickety transport or a driver whowoke upon the wrong side of bed. I needed a reliable way to simulate these occasional challenges.Naturally, my first instinct was totest the travel pillowson a rollercoaster – but the kindly representatives of theme parks, including Alton Towers, told me that this might cause a neck injury. I finally settled on an option that would allow rigorous testing without risking a life-changing injury*: I would wear the travel pillows while playing motion-based arcade games atArcade Club in Leeds.Photographer Christian Hopewell and I barrelled into the arcade with armfuls of travel pillows, looking like the winners of a dozen left-field claw-machine prizes. We selected well-suited games – fun, photogenic and with plenty of movement simulation – and I set to the task of wearing each pillow while the seats rocked, rumbled, tilted and lurched.This taught me a lot about each travel pillow. TheTrtl’s side-bracing support made a high-octane game feel serene. A reasonably pricedmemory foam pillow from Bootswas the perfect shock absorber for a bout of Mach Storm.Lifeventure’s inflatable travel pillowhad ample cushioning for the hard-seated game After Burner, but it slid about on the smooth headrest.Pillow talkView image in fullscreenFlippin’ neck! Pete Wise gets to grips with travel pillow testing at the arcade.Photograph: Christian Hopewell/The GuardianOf course, product testing involves more than playful stress tests at the margins of the relevant – we can’t always be comfily chasing high scores orthrowing suitcases from step-ladders.Before I furrowed my brow and rested my head to the bleeps and chirps of a hundred arcade machines, I had tested the travel pillows on public transport – mostly trains, and a few buses with suitable seating.One of my favourite moments from testing came at the end of the process, when I tried each pillow one last time on a busy train journey from Leeds to Chester. What must my fellow passengers have thought as I reached into a largerucksack, time after time, and produced a flamboyant procession of travel pillows?I like to imagine that they took me for an exceptionally fussy traveller. But if any of them were regular readers of the Filter, they may have recognised our product testing fun and games in motion.*Come to think of it, wearing a travel pillow while playing an arcade game probably isn’t risk-free.

But it was my local sauna that helped me find peace and purposeLeigh SingerMon 10 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 10.27 ESTShareEarlier this year, I was approaching burnout. I felt as though my career as a freelance journalist was on permanent life-support, I was juggling a hectic family life, and I was consumed with worry about a world seemingly hellbent on self-destruction. I was struggling, too, with the death of a close family member and an old school friend. Grieving had become a default status. Despite support from family and loved ones, I needed to find a way to cope with this nearly overwhelming sense of loss.I tried meditation, yoga and therapy, which all helped. Then I heard ofCommunity Sauna Baths, a not-for-profit project in London designed to make saunas accessible and affordable for everyone. From my very first visit, I felt something change. A sense of peace came over me. It immediately felt like a sanctuary, a pocket of calm in the chaotic city that also allowed me to soothe this churning sadness and release some of the bottled-up angst.The one change that worked: I struggled with stress after work – until I made a discovery in my atticRead moreNow, I visit regularly. I tend to go alone but the atmosphere is always friendly and welcoming, and it’s easy to strike up conversation with other guests. Even on busy days, people go out of their way to give each other sauna bench space. There’s a genuine sense of community.There are so many benefits to saunas, I now realise. They reduce stress by releasing endorphins, and help to improve cardiovascular and muscle health. My hamstrings, which usually feel as if they’re permanently encased in cement, have loosened up dramatically. I feel so much more flexible now. I also enjoy the sensory experience of saunas: the smell of the wood, the sizzling of water ladled on hot stones – and, though perhaps less so, the bracing shock of the cold plunge pools afterwards, in which I tend to last a matter of seconds before bailing …I’d always prided myself on my ability to take heat. Partly, I assumed, it had to do with my mum’s Anglo-Indian heritage; partly, a few childhood years living in the scorching Middle East. But I usually – foolishly – framed this ease with higher temperatures as some kind of endurance test.View image in fullscreen‘I emerge rejuvenated – both deeply relaxed and strangely energised.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianI’ve visited saunas before, sporadically, but they turned into how-long-can-you-last competitions, my sweat-soaked torso and singed nasal hair becoming some sort of weird perseverance prize. The therapeutic part of the experience went up in steam.But now my visits to the sauna feel like exercises in mindfulness; the heat helps you stay focused and present. It feels as if my negative thoughts are being flushed away. It’s like a deep cleanse for body and soul.I emerge from a session feeling rejuvenated, both deeply relaxed and strangely energised. It helps realign my sense of emotional balance. I feel physically and mentally more limber, too, as if some of my old anxieties have literally evaporated. My future is still uncertain but I know I can face it now with the heat of new vigour and purpose.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedHealth & wellbeingMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Well, it had a good run.Don’t be so quick to judge. Why is something being the new Dubai a bad thing?You’re right. Why is Malta the new Dubai, then? The warmth? The infrastructure?No, because loads of British people are moving there to avoid paying taxes.I knew it.OK, fine, but you have to admit it’s an attractive deal. According to a report in the Times, Malta is offering British people a variety of non-dom-style tax breaks that include a 15% rate on income remitted to the country and no capital gains tax.But still, aren’t people who traditionally move to Dubai …arguably content to live a life of luxury that relies on a system of economic inequality built on the backs of abused and exploited migrant workers? Sure. But we’re not talking about Dubai. We’re talking about Malta, which is less exploitative.OK, so what else is attractive to British migrants?Well, according to one British resident who spoke to the Times: “They drive on the same side of the road, there are red postboxes, HSBCs on the corner and they have Marks & Spencer.”God, that’salmost worse.Is it? Why?Because people like that are the kind who enjoy the decorative parts of life in the UK but not the parts where they have to contribute.Well, I suppose when you put it like that …And the localpeople? Do they enjoy living in a two-tier country that gives a better deal to wealthy foreigners?Obviously not. They say that so many foreigners are moving there that they can no longer afford homes, and this year the Times of Malta called for a radical tax overhaul to stop giving preferential treatment to economic migrants.I’m not surprised.“They live here and use all our infrastructure but contribute almost nothing, flash their money around and irritate the local Maltese,” it stated.God, I can’t imagine living in a country where people are horrible to migrants.Listen, people are free to do what they like with their lives. If they want to run away to a country where the majority of their neighbours will hate them just to save a few quid on their tax return, that’s up to them.But they do have M&S, though.Then I hope you and your caterpillar cakes are very happy together.Do say:“Malta is an attractive tax haven.”Don’t say:“But I only came for the postboxes.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesMaltaEuropeTaxfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stir-fry the ginger, garlic and spring onions for 30 seconds, then add the mushrooms and fry, stirring, for two minutes more. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then stir in the tofu and fry for two minutes on each side. Add the soy sauce and 20ml water, then scatter in the chopped cabbage. Cover the pan, lower the heat, and let the cabbage steam for three minutes.Meanwhile, make the chilli crisp oil. Put the oil in a small saucepan on a low heat for two minutes – it needs to be hot without being burningly so; if it’s shimmering or smoking, it’s too hot, so let it cool a little, if necessary. Add the chilli flakes and peanuts to the hot oil – they should sizzle without burning – then take off the heat.Add the noodles to the cabbage pan and stir-fry for two minutes, or according to the packet instructions. Taste and adjust the salt as needed, then serve the noodles hot and topped with a teaspoon of chilli oil. Be warned, it isveryhot, so have a taste before adding more. The remaining chilli oil will keep for a week in an airtight jar in the fridge.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyVegetablesNoodlesTofuMain courseVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

British cooking is full of such touchstones, of dishes that feel timeless, yet that also respond beautifully to a fresh approach. I love exploring that balance, keeping the heart of a dish while introducing flavours, textures and ideas that make it feel new, and that’s the philosophy at the heart ofRosi, our new restaurant at the Beaumont hotel in London. Chicken diane and chicken kiev may be rooted in nostalgia, yet, with a little imagination, they can become exciting again.Chicken kiev (pictured top)Sometimes, even just a tiny tweak to an old favourite can make a world of difference. And, yes, truffle paste is a little pricey, but everyone deserves a treat every now and then, plus Christmas is coming up, so you can always use up the rest for an extra touch of luxury over the festivities.Prep15 minChill30 minCook35 minServes6For the truffle butter250g butter60g truffle paste(any brand from the supermarket will do), or 50ml truffle oil1 shallot, peeled and very finely diced (20g net)1 garlic clove, peeled and finely diced2 tbsp finely chopped chivesFor the chicken6 chicken breasts125g plain flour2-3 large eggs, beaten150g panko breadcrumbs4 tbsp olive oilPut all the ingredients for the butter in a blender and blitz smooth. Put the butter mix in a piping bag and cut a small hole at the base.Put the chicken breasts on a chopping board, then, using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into each breast from the fat end down and cutting about halfway into each breast. Pipe the truffle butter into the pocket, taking care not to overfill, then cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, put the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs into three separate shallow bowls, and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.Take the chilled, butter-stuffed chicken breasts out of the fridge and, working one at a time, dip each one first in the flour to coat, then in the egg and finally in the breadcrumbs, making sure they are all well coated.Put a nonstick frying pan on a medium flame, add the olive oil, then shallow fry the breaded chicken breasts, in batches if need be and turning once, until golden on both sides.Transfer the chicken to an oven tray and pop into the hot oven for 15 minutes, until cooked through.Serve at once with creamy mashed potato.Chicken diane with mixed mushroomsView image in fullscreenLisa Goodwin-Allen’s chicken diane with mixed mushrooms.The classic steak sauce, but with chicken.Prep20 minBrine1 hr 30 minCook1 hr 30 minServes2For the chicken100g sea saltThe peel of1 lemon, shaved off in wide strips1 whole head of garlic, unpeeled and smashed just to separate and bash open the cloves a little2 sprigs fresh thyme5 black peppercorns1.2kg chicken crown, wishbone removedFor the herb butter stuffing115g butter25g mixed soft herbs(ie, tarragon, chives, chervil), roughly chopped10g smoked salt10g roast garlic(jarred or homemade), blended to a paste, or roast garlic paste100g brioche breadcrumbs, or panko breadcrumbsJuice and finely grated zest of 1 lemon, to tasteFor the diane sauce30g olive oil120g white onion, peeled and finely diced (100g net)150g mixedmushrooms(shiitake, oyster, button, chestnut, wild), diced1 garlic clove, peeled and grated80ml brandy1 tsp wholegrain mustard1 tsp dijon mustard1 tsp English mustard150ml goodchicken stock, a dark one, ideally30g creme fraiche2 tsp finely chopped parsleyFirst make a brine. Put the salt, lemon strips, garlic, thyme and peppercorns in a large saucepan, add a litre of water and bring to a boil, whisking until all the salt dissolves. Take off the heat and leave to cool completely.Put the chicken crown in the cooled brine, making sure it’s fully submerged, then set aside to steep for an hour and a half.Meanwhile, make the herb butter. Put the butter in a large bowl, whisk until white and fluffy, then fold in all the other herb butter ingredients until well combined. Season to taste, then put in a piping bag, ready for stuffing the chicken.Lift the chicken out of its brine and pat dry all over. Loosen the skin over the breasts and pipe in all the herb butter. If you’re not cooking the crown immediately, cover and put in the fridge.Take the chicken out of the fridge an hour before cooking, if need be, so it comes back up to room temperature, and heat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/260F/gas ½. Put the chicken on a rack set inside a baking tray, then roast for an hour and 10 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 58C. Remove, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes. Turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Once the chicken has rested, return it to the hot oven for eight minutes, until the skin is golden all over and crisp.While the chicken is roasting, make the sauce. Put the olive oil in a hot pan over a medium heat, add the chopped onion and cook, stirring, for a minute or two, until soft. Add the diced mushrooms and grated garlic to the pot, and cook for two minutes more. Pour in the brandy, turn up the heat to high and leave to bubble and reduce until the liquid starts to thicken and coat the mushrooms. Stir in all three mustards, then add the stock and bring to a boil. Take off the heat, stir in the creme fraiche and chopped parsley, and keep warm.To serve, carve the breasts off the crown, put one breast on each plate and spoon the sauce over the top. Again, this is great with creamy mash.Lisa Goodwin-Allen is culinary director atthe Beaumont, London W1Explore more on these topicsFoodChickenMain courseVegetablesBritish food and drinkMeatrecipesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it is best to install a charger – a dedicated AC station that operates at much faster speeds and connects to the vehicle via a cable.Many home chargers will charge at a maximum rate of 7.4kW, which means a typical EV will be able to do 25-30 miles for every hour it is plugged in.View image in fullscreenInstalling a dedicate electric vehicle charger at home can cost between £800 and £1,200.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAAuto Express puts the average cost of installing a charger at between £800 and £1,200. Governmentgrants of £350 are availableif you rent your home or own a flat with private off street parking or a house that has on-street parking.You will need a smart meter so that your energy supplier can check your usage throughout the day to apply the correct rates at different times (see below).Charging is more straightforward for drivers with a driveway or garage than for the 9.3 million households without an off-street parking space. Some local authorities have on-street residential charging points, such as in lamp posts.The government is considering removing the planning permission requirementto install cross pavement ‘gullies’ through which cables run from home to car.The tariffsAll of the main energy suppliers have at least one EV tariff, which typically allow owners to charge their car at specific times of the day for cheaper rates.The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, sayspeople on the default tariff pay an average of 26p a kilowatt hourbut many specialist EV tariffs charge less than 8p/kWh at night.View image in fullscreenLong-distance drivers should look for the cheapest night rate and the longest charging window.Photograph: Johner Images/AlamyBen Gallizzi of the comparison site Uswitch says there are different types of deals available for drivers. The “classic” EV tariff allows drivers to charge during a cheap window overnight. For example theBritish Gas tariffcosts 9p/kWh from midnight to 5am;E.ON’s Next Driveis 7.5p/kWh between 12am to 6am andScottish Power’s EV Savercosts 7.2p/kWh from midnight to 5am.Then there are intelligent smart tariffs that schedule the car to charge at the cheapest times of the day – such as when demand is lower or when there is more renewable energy on the grid. You plug in your car and tell the system how much charge is needed. It starts charging the car when energy is cheapest.Intelligent Octopus Go, for example, charges 7p/kWh.A new type of plan on the market is the subscription pack, says Gallizzi. Octopus’sIntelligent Drive Packoffers unlimited smart charging for £30 a month.Ovo’s Charge Anytimestarts at £27.50, with a limit of 700 miles of smart charging a month.Some EV tariffs are only available if you are an existing customer to the supplier. So if you want to avail of a particular tariff, you may have to switch to that provider first on a regular tariff and then move on to the EV tariff.When assessing which is the best value for your car,Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert site warnsthat many “two-tier” tariffs, where there are different rates depending on the time, can have peak rates that exceed the price cap along with the attractive night time rates. For example, Intelligent Octopus Go’s day rate is about 29p/kWh while the default tariff is 26p.View image in fullscreenFor city drivers, smart charging options could be the better option, say experts.Photograph: SouthWorks/AlamyThere is also the potential for savings through salary sacrifice schemes, where the cost of charging at home is deducted from eligible people’s gross salary before tax and national insurance are taken off. With theElectric Car Scheme’s charge card, employees pay their utility bill and give the mileage to their employer which then gives a reimbursement in the next pay cheque.How to chooseThe best deal will depend on your mileage.Gallizzi says that long distance drivers should look for the cheapest night rate and the longest charging window. “The goal is to make sure you’re fully charging your vehicle every night so you’re good to go in the morning,” he says. For example,E.ON’s NextDrive Smartcosts 6.5p/kWh between midnight and 6am.For city drivers, smart charging could be the better option, he says. “The system should find the cheapest charging slot for you.” As well as Intelligent Octopus Go, there is alsoScottish Power’s EV Optimisetariff, which charges 9p/kWh.Explore more on these topicsMotoringElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The last years of his life were very difficult as we tried to support him while keeping life as normal as possible for our other children.Amid the stress, we were late with two repayments on our mortgage withMetro Bankin February and March. Since April we have been fully up to date.Recently our application to remortgage our house with Nationwide was refused because Metro had placed late payment markers on our credit file.We explained the circumstances in August and, given our previous good repayment history, askedit to remove the markers as a goodwill gesture.It refused. This is causing extreme stress to us as we rebuild from our loss.Name and address suppliedYour family has suffered unimaginable anguish. Your son died in hospital and you are awaiting an inquest to determine the cause. During the pandemic, the then 14-year-old had suffered an acute mental breakdown.Over the next five years he was repeatedly sectioned, hospitalised and housed in secure children’s homes 60 miles from where you live. For two years, you had to manage his care at home until it became impossible to keep him and your other children safe. His final nine months were spent in supported accommodation and you made the 120 mile round trip to visit him several times a week.It is at this point that you twice fell behind with your repayments. Credit reports have to reflect missed payments or defaults so that lenders can make informed decisions on whether an applicant can afford the deal they are requesting.However, according to the credit rating agency Experian, lenders can choose to amend files in exceptional circumstances. Your circumstances certainly count as exceptional, so I asked Metro if it could remove the markers.This time it agreed. It told me that if it had been aware of your ordeal at the time the payments were missed it would have made allowances.“We understand not all customers want to talk to their bank about personal circumstances,” said a spokesperson. “However, for individuals facing financial challenges, we’d advise speaking to us as early as possible to discuss support options available.”Nationwide told me that it too had been unaware of the mitigating circumstances and promised to review your application. Unfortunately, this resulted in a second refusal because the bank statements you submitted suggest you would struggle to repay the loan.You say the cost of your son’s funeral temporarily depleted your balance. I suggest you wait until your finances have recovered, then make a new mortgage application as multiple applications in a short space of time can damage your credit score. In the meantime I wish you and your family well as you navigate a future without your son.We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

But that’s not always the case, says Adam Collins, a researcher from the Centre for Nutrition, Exercise and Metabolism at the University of Bath.Sweating, he says, is part of the thermoregulation process. When your body temperature rises, it signals to your brain to sweat in order to cool you down. As the sweat evaporates, it helps regulate your core temperature.One reason temperature rises is exercise. “When we exercise, the energy we produce to fuel that activity creates heat as a byproduct,” says Collins. The more intense the workout, the more heat is generated – and usually, the more you sweat. But sweat levels can be misleading.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

But on a cold day, you might barely sweat at allIs it true that … cutting out carbs helps you lose weight?Read more“There are many other factors that influence how much you sweat,” he adds. These include the temperature of the environment, your clothing and humidity. In humid conditions, sweat evaporates less efficiently, making you feel sweatier than usual, whether or not you’re working hard.“If you went on an easy run on a hot, humid day, you’d probably sweat a lot,” he says. “But on a cold day, you might run at a much higher intensity and barely sweat at all.”Sweat also varies from person to person. Your fitness level, age, sex, body size and even whether you’re acclimatised to the climate you’re in all play a role.So, no, sweat isn’t a reliable measure of how hard you’ve worked out. Better indicators of exertion include how hard you’re breathing, your perceived effort, and your heart rate, which you can track with a chest strap monitor or smart watch. That said, “sweat is a good marker of dehydration”, says Collins.

I stomped and chomped my way across the city to find outBen AitkenMon 10 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareIonce ate seven bowls ofragù bologneseover the course of a single weekend. I was in Bologna, to be fair, and on a mission – to get to the bottom ofspag bol(yes, I know it should be served with tagliatelle). A few years earlier, I did something similar with a Polish stew calledbigos(a sort of hunter’s stew). I wanted to learn about its variations, its nuances, and I wondered what you could find out about a place if you dived into one dish in particular. In the case ofbigos, I gleaned that the Polish are prepared to wait a long time for things to be done.My friend Tom suffers from a similar obsession (just last month he dropped a dozen scotch eggs on a bank holiday Monday) and so when he said he was heading to Paris to eat multiplesteak frites, I wasn’t exactly surprised. He wasn’t just going for a laugh, mind you: Tom runs a pub in London called theCarlton Tavern, and had come to the opinion that his steak and chips could do with a bit of zhooshing up. Hence the recce in Paris. But a man travelling all that way to examine meat and potatoes cannot do so alone, so I volunteered my services.A staple of French brasserie cuisine,steak fritescame to prominence during the 19th century, when Paris was filling up with a new, urban working class who wanted, well, filling up. It’s now a standard on anyprix fixemenu alongside coq au vin, duck confit and beef bourguignon.Steak frites came to prominence during the 19th century when Paris was filling up with a new, urban working classDespite its simplicity, the dish hasn’t avoided philosophical attention. In his essay collectionMythologies, the heavyweight thinker Roland Barthes gavesteak fritesa proper considering. Just as a cup of tea is traditionally regarded as the remedy to all varieties of strife in some parts of the world (“Lost your job? I’ll stick the kettle on …”), it seemed to Barthes thatsteak friteswas imbued with special significance. For the philosopher, the juicy beef was a sign of vitality and brio, and when paired with the humble chip, the result was practically a dialectic on a plate. Simply put,steak fritesis more than the sum of its parts.Taking advantage of theEurostar Snap service, which allows you to select the day of travel but not the exact time, I bag myself a discounted return for just £90. And so, within three hours of leaving London, we find ourselves tucking into our first steak.Robertet LouiseView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Paulo CartolanoThis homely outfit in the Marais has been going since the 1950s and cooks steaks over an open fireplace. The cut isentrecôte(AKA ribeye), which is served with sauteed potatoes and a green salad dressed with a classic vinaigrette. The steak is good, my medium rare (à point) is trumping Tom’s rare (saignant), the extra minute or so giving the fat a chance to render. There’s no sauce as such, but the mingling of dressing, meat juices and mustard makes a topping unnecessary. I ask the barman what he thinks of English wine. He says it’s a nice idea.€25, 8/10Brasserie LippView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kalpana Kartik/AlamyA respectable amount of time later, we take on a rump on the other side of the Seine, on Boulevard Saint-Germain. Founded in 1880, Lipp is a classy joint – all vast mirrors and gleaming banquettes – and this particular lunchtime the place is abuzz. My slab (orpavé) of rump is fair to middling, but the fries aren’t as chipper as they might be. Once again there is no sauce, while the accompanying salad – some undressed lamb’s lettuce – brings little to the party. The best feature is the performance of our waiter, whose service manages to be exceptionally brusque yet unquestionably friendly. François explains that the 12 on his lapel conveys his standing in the pecking order. ‘‘I started at 23 and aspire to single digits,’’ he says. “And what happens when you get to one?” I ask. “You die.”€25, 6.5/10Le Pick-ClopsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Liliya Sayfeeva/AlamyOn François’ recommendation, we proceed to Le Pick-Clops, a laid-back bistro on the right bank of the river that is popular with students. Having learned that 2m bottles of wine are consumed in Paris each day, we do our bit to uphold this remarkable statistic by seeing off a carafe while waiting on our meal. The steak, when it comes, isonglet, or butcher’s steak, a cut that is typically dark and lean owing to the muscle’s working-class background. Here it’s served with a classically dressed green salad, a small gravy boat of blue cheese sauce and dauphinoise potatoes. There’s some chew on the beef but I don’t mind that, for it gives the dish’s other elements a chance to collaborate. On leaving, I ask the bartender where we should go next. He offers an enormous shrug and says: “Nowhere.” I give him a look designed to encourage elaboration. “Any place can do this dish,” he explains. “Don’t think about it. Just go.”€15, 8.5/10skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s on Boulevard du Temple in the 3rd arrondissement. In French,bouillonmeans a broth or a stock and also a large restaurant doing classic dishes at good prices – thinkoeuf mayonnaisefor €2.50. Whilebouillonshave been around for ages, this one is a fresh incarnation – though you’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise, seeing how retro the decor is. The rump steak asks a bit too much of my mandible, while the fries give the impression they were cooked a while ago – conceivable in a place with up to 450 covers. The pepper sauce is decent, but a topping cannot carry a plate on its own.€12.60, 6.5/10LeBastringueView image in fullscreenBen Aitken outside Le BastringueAmbling along the Canal Saint-Martin, I remember the words of the chap at Le Pick-Clops, who told us to go nowhere. For no other reason than it’s giving offAmélievibes and it must have been all of 10 minutes since we last ate, we walk into La Bastringue. The place is busy with local people. Red paint, a view of the kitchen, the noises of a French lunchtime – the atmosphere is deliciously Gallic. The steak ispoire de boeuf, a pear-shaped cut from the top of the hind leg that is beloved by butchers for being especially flavourful and tender. It comes with a kind of slaw, miniature roasties and a shallot sauce. Having noticed others doing it, I ask the waiter fortoutes les sauces, a small amount of every sauce on the menu, which he duly delivers. With my dipping options tripled, the meal proves a delight, and we declare Le Bastringue our winner, meaning that “nowhere” has triumphed. A lesson has been learned: sometimes one is better off skipping the queue, ignoring the hype and just going anywhere instead.€14,9/10Waiting for the train home at Gare du Nord, Tom starts sketching out his perfectsteak frites. By the time we get back to London, he has the details nailed down. Which steak made the cut? What potatoes prevailed? There’s only one way to find out: you’ll have to visit his tavern. (Or I could just tell you: it’songletwith skinny chips, dijon mustard and some smartly dressed leaves.)For the record, my perfectsteak fritescannot be put on a menu, for it contains no fixed elements or recurring features.

But there is a simple reason why some people enjoy those sensationsJoel SnapeMon 10 Nov 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 04.02 ESTShareThe first thing to understand about eating spicy food is that it really isn’t a matter of taste. Capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum plants that are a key ingredient in anything you’d think of as “spicy”, evolved as an irritant to stop mammals from chewing and destroying plant seeds. It acts on the nervous system directly through receptors in the tongue, throat and skin – no taste buds required – and, in theory, tells our bodies that the thing we’ve just ingested is something to get rid of as soon as possible. The obvious question, then, is: why do some of us like the sensation so much?To start to understand that, it’s helpful to know a bit more about what’s going on in the body. “Think of an engineering brief where we have to detect irritants in a system and clear them rapidly,” says Liam Browne, an associate professor at UCL who specialises in the neuroscience of sensory perception and pain. “Capsaicin binds to a receptor in the body called TRPV1, which is found in a specialised class of neurons called nociceptors that usually detect things that are potentially damaging to the body.” When that happens, it’s like a little fire alarm goes off and activates parts of the autonomic nervous system, which regulates various involuntary bodily functions without conscious control. “That’s what leads to all these physiological effects like tearing up, sweating, or your nose running,” says Browne. “It’s your body trying to get rid of the irritant.”View image in fullscreenSome like it hot … curry.Photograph: d3sign/Getty ImagesTRPV1 (pronounced trip-vee-one, if you’re explaining this to someone over a delicious curry) is also activated by other things, like your body’s temperature rising above 42C – the point where heat becomes tissue-damaging – and piperine, the main active component in black pepper, which gives a much more mild response. Other hot (but not exactlyspicy) foods activate different receptors – mustard, wasabi and radishes are handled by TRPA1, while TRPM8 is mostly responsible for cold temperatures and menthol. “You can actually find other chemicals that have a far more potent effect than capsaicin on TRPV1,” says Browne. “There’s one plant, Euphorbia resinifera, that’s known as ‘resin spurge’ because of its associations with the idea of purging. It contains resiniferatoxin, a capsaicin-like compound that’s often described as around 1,000 times more potent, and is genuinely dangerous.” Yes, aYouTube creator has tried it.So how are we enjoying any of this? After all, it’s not a recent development. The first evidence of people eating chillies comes from around 7000BC in Mexico and Central America, with similar plants being cultivated roughly 1,000 years later. Peppers weren’t introduced to Europe until about the 16th century, but they’ve boomed in popularity since: the global hot sauce market isprojected to be worth $5bn (£3.8bn) by 2030, up from just over $3bn two years ago. Whoreallylikes crying out irritants and quaffing milk that much?Why do we yawn? It’s almost certainly not for the reason you thinkRead moreFirstly, some people have different variants of the TRPV1 gene, which change how easily it switches on and turns off after activation (interestingly, the gene is present but insensitive to capsaicin in all birds and one species of tree-shrew, letting them eat spicy seeds with impunity). But the receptors also become less sensitive over time, so it’s entirely possible to develop a relative immunity to moderately spicy foods – or deliberately cultivate one.As for why we like it, that might bebecauseof the sensation it causes. “Research is still ongoing into how human brains learn what is and isn’t safe, including which foods are safe for consumption,” says Browne. “Recent work emphasises prediction, context and controllability. The idea is that when you eat something spicy, you get an initial alarm-like ‘heat’ signal. With repeated exposure the peripheral response desensitises, and the brain learns the cue is safe and under control. That shift in prediction and certainty is a large part of why the experience becomes tolerable – and then rewarding.” The more spice you eat, the theory goes, the less intense the first painful part becomes, and the more relief you get afterwards.View image in fullscreenPain or pleasure? Korean spicy wings.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty Images“There’s also the idea of reappraisal, or the fact that through exposure and experience, we reframe the meaning of what the pain represents and that it’s actually safe for us,” says Browne. “That sense of control and mastery matters – on top of the social and cultural component of doing this with your family or friends. It’s the same logic as watching scary films or going on rollercoasters, sometimes called ‘benign masochism’. Importantly, these learning and revaluation mechanisms also tell us something useful about pain more broadly: when a stimulus is mislabelled as threatening, reframing and restoring a sense of control can reduce its impact.” Like other initially unpleasant experiences – think running, cold showers or hot saunas – pushing on through the initial pain also coaxes the body into releasing endorphins, transforming those Korean chicken wings into a mild sort of high.But what do you do if you’ve been invited out for wings and you’re not feeling up to it? The first thing to remember is that capsaicin is fat-soluble and hydrophobic: this means that if you drink water it will stay where it is, while milk will dissolve the capsaicin and then bind to it, ultimately carrying it away.Alcohol, in case you’re wondering, can dilutecapsaicin, but won’t bind to it – and will only do the job if it’s present in high percentages, meaning that beer is unlikely to help. Yoghurt, if you’ve got a little pot on the side, will do the same job as milk – but there’s an even tastier option. “Mint ice-cream provides the fat and protein to carry capsaicin away but will also trigger your TRPM8 receptors, which signal coolness and can take the edge off TRPV1’s ‘heat pain’,” says Browne.Keep a tub on hand next time you invite people over for a jalfrezi – and remind everyone that it’s a cultural ritual with deep historical resonances.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Two dead at the drink-off – a brilliant new lateral thinking puzzleThe solution to today’s poison puzzlerAlex BellosMon 10 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 12.07 ESTShareEarlier todayI set you the following puzzle. Here it is again with the solution.Two dead at the drink-offIn a far away land, the following facts are true and known to everyone:1) A person who ingests a poison will die within the hour UNLESS that person ingests a stronger poison, which acts as an antidote and restores complete health.2) Smith and Jones are the only manufacturers of poison.3) Each makes several types of poison.4) All poisons have different strengths.5) Smith and Jones do not have access to each other’s poisons.No one knows whether Smith or Jones makes the strongest poison. One day the Queen decides to find out. She summons Smith and Jones to her palace and says:“In one week from now, you will both return here. Bring a vial of your own poison. There will be a ceremony. First, both of you will take a swig from the other one’s vial. Next, you will both take a swig from your own vials. You will then be watched for one hour.“It is in your own interests to bring your strongest poison. The person who brings the strongest poison will obviously survive. The other person will clearly die. There will be trained observers to make sure you cannot cheat.”Smith and Jones leave, both very disturbed. They do not want to die, and neither is confident of having the strongest poison. Nor does either have any way of getting access to the other’s poisons. They wrack their brains all week trying to think how they can best ensure their own survival. The appointed time arrives. The ceremony takes place exactly as planned by the Queen. Smith and Jones swig each other’s vials and then their own. They are watched carefully for one hour.To everyone’s astonishment, both Smith and Jones keel over and die! The Royal Coroner confirms that both died of poisoning.What happened?SolutionThey both died because both Smith and Jones drank a weak poison just before arriving at the ceremony, and, instead of bringing a strong poison as requested, brought water. Each drank the other’s water, then drank their own water, and then died of their own poison.But why did they do this?Smith was hoping that Jones would not think of the same trick and would, as requested, bring a strong poison to the showdown. That way, Jones’ strong poison would cure Smith of Smith’s own weak poison, and Smith would live, whereas Jones would die from drinking his own poison.(There would remain the risk that the Queen would discover the attempt to circumvent the rules, but this risk could be mitigated by Smith drinking every last drop of water.)Yet Jones thought similarly, and so both died.This puzzle was conceived by Michael Rabin in the 1980s and recently brought to light by the mathematician Timothy Chow, of the Centre for Communications Research in Princeton, New Jersey. To read more, please read his article on it inMathematics Magazine(paywall).

She reflects on what it takes to stay strong and keep goingPaula CocozzaMon 10 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 11.03 ESTShareBetty Reid Soskin was 92 when she first went viral and became, in effect, a rock star of the National Park Service. She was the oldest full-time national park ranger in the US – this was back in 2013; she’d become a ranger at 85 – but she had been furloughed along with 800,000 other federal employees during the government shutdown. News channels flocked to interview her. She was aggrieved not to be working, she told them; she had a job to do.“In a funny way, I suppose that started lots of things,” Soskin says. Her memoir, Sign My Name to Freedom, was published in 2018, and a documentary about her work, No Time to Waste, was released in 2020.Another filmis in the works. Barack Obama called her “profoundly inspiring”. Annie Leibovitz photographed her. Glamour magazine named her woman of the year. Now, Reid Soskin is 104, and “all of whatever I was supposed to do, I’ve done”, she says.She retired as a ranger at 100, having helped to establish theRosie the Riveter World War II Home Frontnational park in Richmond, California, where she shared, day after day, the wartime experiences of people of colour, because “what gets remembered is determined by who’s in the room doing the remembering”. At the time, she joked that her job was almost “like I’m running a federally funded revolution ... I was very aware that I was in my 90s and I really didn’t have time to waste,” she says.View image in fullscreenSoskin announces her retirement at a news conference in Richmond, California, 15 April 2022, aged 100.Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesUnderstandably, Soskin’s sense of time has evolved since entering her second century, softening into something more amorphous. “Now that I’ve held on a few more years, I really do feel old,” she says. “Memories are getting dimmer and dimmer, and events feel as if they happened yesterday … and simultaneously many years ago. Time has collapsed in on itself.”Political events, too – she mentions Donald Trump’s deployment of the national guard to US cities – are collapsing “in on themselves. And I feel as though it’s all of a piece.”Soskin is still not sitting back. “I follow politics very closely,” she says on a video call from her home in Richmond, where she lives with her daughter, Di’ara. “Even going through the 50s and the 60s with civil rights, that was all [progress],” she says. “I don’t feel as if that’s so now ... It’s seemed to me that [Trump] has no idea what he’s doing. I think we’ve lost our sense of direction. And that’s terrifying to me, because I’m going to leave the world in such a shape.“I find myself wondering what [the world] is going to look like and I don’t have any idea. This is a time of chaos … We grow through life always thinking there’s something better ahead. And for the first time in my life, I’m not sure there is.”Soskin was born Betty Charbonnet, and grew up initially in New Orleans; the family moved to Oakland, California, after the floods of 1927. Her father came from a Creole background, her mother a Cajun background, and her great-grandmother, who lived to 102, had been born into slavery in 1846. But after she came to public attention, new episodes of Soskin’s long and varied life kept coming to the fore. There are many different Bettys – she refers to herself as Betty, as a way to uncouple herself from the men in her life – and for a long time, she says, she didn’t know “who Betty was”.There was the Betty who had opened Reid’s Records in 1945, one of the first black record shops in California, with her then husband, Mel Reid. There was Betty the singer of protest songs, who surfaced on social media a few years ago in a set of reel-to-reel tapes recorded in her 30s. There was Betty the civil rights and community activist who raised funds for the Black Panthers and later helped to tackle the drug trade in the area around Reid’s Records. There was Betty who worked in local government as a legislative aide. All this before she became famous as the National Park Service’s oldest, and possibly most outspoken, ranger.It was when “the three men” in her life died – Reid; her second husband, the psychologist William Soskin; and her father – in a three-month period in the late 1980s, that Reid Soskin’s life was transformed. “It’s like I stepped out of one life and went into another,” she says.“That was actually when my life started. Because I didn’t really know who I was until then. Then I became Betty. Oh, that was wonderful. I really began to see myself as being a part of the world. I began to be in my own shoes. I had things to do – and that lasted until I was 100. I went on doing things. I was no longer becoming, I was simply being.”View image in fullscreenMeeting Barack Obama at the 93rd Annual National Christmas Tree Lighting in Washington DC, 3 December 2015.Photograph: Paul Morigi/Getty ImagesIn 2015, she was asked to introduce Obama at the national Christmas tree-lighting ceremony in Washington DC. (She had previously declined an invitation to the White House from George W Bush.)“I remember being led to where [the Obamas] were standing between two flags. And rather than look at the president, I was looking at her [Michelle] and saying out loud, ‘You are so beautiful.’” Soskin had in her pocket that day a photograph of her great-grandmother, Leontine Breaux Allen, whom Betty knew well into her own 20s. I stood there like a page of history,” she says. “I was standing beside the president of the United States. I was standing within the shadow of the White House. And it was built by slaves.”She holds a commemorative coin up to her camera: Obama slipped one just like it into her hand when he shook it. The original was stolen in a house burglary, so this one is a replacement. “I don’t think there’s ever anything that matches the lived moment,” she says. Mementoes are “like ashes. They’re simply symbols of what was.”Empty tollbooths, ‘devastated’ visitors: shutdown throws US national parks into limboRead moreSoskin says she no longer thinks of herself as a feminist or an activist, just “as a person. I never did like labels.” She doesn’t even regard herself as “a singer”; simply as “a Betty who sang”. She started composing songs on a guitar, a Christmas gift from Reid, when their marriage was disintegrating. “I was in the middle of a breakdown, and I thought I was remembering things,” she says, realising only much later that she was actually creating them – “and seemed to have captured all the things that were important”.She could have been a successful singer. She once performed with Pete Seeger, and after the film-maker Henry Hampton heard her at a Unitarian convention, she says, “he convinced me that I could sing, and he had me come to Connecticut. I spent two weeks with a musical director.” But on the eve of her audition tosing at the Village Vanguard in New York she says, she decided to go home instead. She had been to a party in New York: “I found myself in a room filled with people who were using marijuana. I had never seen it. And I decided then that wasn’t the world for me. I went home.”Soskin only sings now, she says, when she’s asleep: “I remember every line of everything in my dreams.”In an age when longevity is prized, how does she feel about living so long? “I think it’s given to us. I don’t know that I could have controlled what I’m doing or how I’m living. I just – I don’t. I think it’s a gift. I don’t know where it will lead or where it’s going to take me. I have no idea. Except it’s off. It’s running free.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60US national and state parks holidaysCivil rights movementNational parksBarack ObamaMichelle ObamafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Look me in the eye and tell me you actually remembered to change everything over.This is an executive-functioning burden I’ve managed to take off my brain’s plate.All you need to do is create the ultimate, easily transferable survival pouch containing everything you could possibly need when you find yourself in a bind.How to choose your itemsEveryone’s daily needs will be different, and with pouch real estate at a premium. So you need to be judicious about what you choose to include – eventually.In an ideal world you’d keep a list in your planner, and every time you or someone you’re with needed something, you’d make a note and eventually add that to your pouch. But realistically, who thinks to quickly write down “nail clippers” when there’s blood everywhere from trying to fix a hangnail the old-fashioned way?So try doing it backwards. Go through your house and find everything you think would be useful to have while you’re out and about, and put it all into a large, temporary pouch. Carry that around for a couple of weeks, then when you inevitably get sick of it being so goddamn heavy, lay all its contents out on a table, take an audit of the objects you actually used, then banish the underperformers back to your cupboards.If you want a head start, I went through this exact process.

Photographs by Polly BradenSeascape: the state of our oceans is supported byAbout this contentMon 10 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 05.49 ESTShareThree schoolboys in black sweatshirts dart from a wooden fort across a sandpit, weaving and jostling past prams, scooters and bystanders, after a pink football. A pony-tailed girl launches herself on to a moving roundabout, while a young man wrestles a half-naked toddler into a pair of training pants before she scampers off back to the sandpit in the autumn sunshine.This is Buckland adventure playground inPortsmouth, surrounded by trees and a mix of two-storey flats, terrace houses and tower blocks, mostly social housing built to replace the city’s demolished slums.It is a throwback, a product of the postwar 1960s welfare state. And yet, after more than a decade of cuts that haveravaged leisure provision for children and youth servicesacross England and Wales, the playground, and the youth club connected to it, have survived despite ever-lengthening odds.Generations of children, a high percentage of whom live in relative poverty, have grown up here. For many it is a “second home”, a space where they feel seen and safe.View image in fullscreenBuckland adventure playground has now had three generations of children enjoying its facilities“I can’t think of how many kids have gone though our hands,” says Maureen Maplesden, a former Post Office clerk who began volunteering after the playground was built half a century ago. Now 83, a grandmother of six and a great-grandmother of four, she never stopped.“We’re seeing third-generation kids – and that says something,” she says. “It’s so important kids have a place to play safely and use their imaginations.”Maplesden has fundraised, gardened, and taught arts, crafts, photography and pottery. She helped set up a committee to save it when the space was once threatened with closure. And now her daughter, Nicky Andrews, is the full-time playground manager.“I’ve spent more time here than in my own house,” says Maplesden. “When my husband was alive, he would be here, painting or gardening.”View image in fullscreenMaureen Maplesden, 83, who ran the adventure playground as a volunteer, with her daughter Nicky, who took over as managerMollie May Casey, 19, a former playground regular before she graduated to the nearby Buckland youth activity centre (BYAC) for 11- to 19-year-olds, says she “grew up here”.“My mum used to bring me and when I was old enough to come on my own, at six, I used to bring my little sister,” she says.Casey, who was bullied at school, found adults to confide in here. She says: “I got bullied all my life; I didn’t care, I grew up with it.“Here, there’s always someone to talk to. I love Nicky. She’s busy but she has always got a word for you.”Q&AWhat is the Against the tide series?ShowOver the next year, the Against the Tide project from the Guardian’s Seascape team will be reporting on the lives of young people in coastal communities across England and Wales.Young people in many of England's coastal towns are disproportionately likely to face poverty, poor housing, lower educational attainment and employment opportunities than their peers in equivalent inland areas. In the most deprived coastal towns they can be left to struggle with crumbling and stripped-back public services and transport  that limit their life choices.For the next 12 months, accompanied by the documentary photographer Polly Braden, we will travel up and down the country to port towns, seaside resorts and former fishing villages  to ask 16- to 25-year-olds to tell us about their lives and how they feel about the places they live.By putting their voices at the front and centre of our reporting, we want to examine what kind of changes they need to build the futures they want for themselves.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The playground, one of six in Portsmouth, is a feeder for the nearby youth club, one of four in the city. The retention of this number of youth spaces in one place is almost unprecedented at a time whencentres are disappearing at other coastal townswith high levels of deprivation.Casey made new friends at BYAC and met her boyfriend, Blake Turnball, 18, who is father to their 11-month-old baby, Albie.View image in fullscreenMollie May Casey with her boyfriend, Blake Turnball, and their 11-month-old baby, Albie. Buckland youth activity centre helped bring the couple together“We’ve been mates for six years,” Casey says, as Turnball plays with the younger children behind her. “We used to say we liked each other, and then we said no and then yeah. And he finally said yeah, and that was it.”We want working-class children to get the same advantages as middle-class childrenDarren SandersNow they bring Albie to the playground. They don’t take him to mother and baby groups because “you get mums that think they’re better than everyone else. Here, they don’t judge you.”Another regular, Molly Webb, 22, who now comes with her four-year-old son, Elijah, says it became a second home for her, full of “magical” childhood memories.Webb, who is in her third year at university, studying English literature and history, says: “I grew up in play centres and my mum grew up in them. They do camps away, to the New Forest, which we wouldn’t have been able to afford. On night walks, Nicky would make up these beautiful stories, about unicorns and witches. My brother is 11, and he and his friends still talk about them.”Nearly aquarter of children in Portsmouth live in relative low-income families(those with an income below 60% of the current national average)compared with England’s average of 20%. It has the second-highest proportion of children (17.3%) living in families with absolute low income in the south-east, which has an average of 10.8%.View image in fullscreenMolly Webb, 22, with her younger sister, Chloe, and her four-year-old son Elijah at Buckland adventure playgroundBuckland has thesecond-highest proportion of disabled residents in the city, at 26.7%, compared with the English average of 17.7%, as well as a higher prevalence of childhood obesity and poor health outcomes. Parts of Portsmouth council’s Charles Dickens ward, named after the author and social critic who was born here and where BYAC is situated, are among the 10% most deprived areas in the country.If the playground is the beating heart of Buckland’s community, then matriarchs such as Andrews, Maplesden and the others who work or volunteer here, are its lifeblood. They spot the children who are hungry but have no money for the tuck shop, the parents who need help, and the traumatic life events and crippling illnesses that can leave children on their own.Andrews, 55, loves her job. “I’m a big kid at heart. I love the whole ethos of play.” She came here for her first job at 18 in the 1980s, on a Youth Training Scheme, returned five years later and never left. “They’re going to have to carry me out of here in a box,” she says with a grin.View image in fullscreenLayla Morgan, 16, who now plays football in a semi-professional league, credits youth workers at BYAC with helping give her stability after the ‘chaos’ of previous yearsUp the road at the BYAC, four youngsters are playing pool while others sit at a table for a game of cards with a youth worker. There are PlayStations and an outdoor football pitch; the kitchen has a sign reading: “Sometimes good people make bad choices.”Layla Morgan, 16, a footballer with Portsmouth women’s Under-21s and AFC Portchester women’s first team, comes here most nights to relax, she says.“Sometimes I meet my friends after college and come here. We play football or Fifa on the PlayStation.“The staff are very supportive. Before I came here, I used to be a little bit naughty. You’d go out with three people and end up with 100 people and it would be chaos. We’d play hide and seek in the shopping centre and they would kick us out.”View image in fullscreenEsme Swain-Edwards, nine, enjoys the swing at Buckland playgroundLayla has processing issues, autism and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which caused her problems at school and made her more vulnerable than other children, according to her mother, Donna Morgan.“When she was younger, she would do things like jump on a train to Fareham to go to the woman’s football. We had to sit her down, explain the danger she could be in.“Here, she has stability. She knows she can talk to Luke [Preston, youth centre manager] and he’s great. There’s certain things kids don’t want to talk to their parents about but they need to talk. She gets that here.”The council playgrounds are used by more than 91,000 children a year, while 21,000 attend its youth clubs.Portsmouth council took a decision to fund and prioritise play and youth services two decades ago because so many children were living in “absolute poverty”, according to Darren Sanders, the council’s deputy leader and Liberal Democrat cabinet member for housing and homelessness.Sanders, who was not on the council at the time, says that commitment has not wavered and, with other arms of the council and outside agencies, they work together to help safeguard vulnerable children who could be at risk from exploitation or being drawn intocounty linesdrug distribution.“We believe that building up relationships and trust breaks down barriers and helps people live the lives they want to lead,” he says. “We want working-class children to get the same advantages as middle-class children.”As some youth club catchment areas have such a high proportion of council tenants – up to 68% in Buckland – Portsmouth can fund part of its annual £2.2m play and youth service bill out of council rents and service charges, along with money from other sources.‘We’re told we won’t amount to anything’: is it possible to change the fortunes of young people living in England’s coastal towns?Read moreA 2024 study on theimpact of youth club closures in Londonfound the average pupil did 4% worse in GCSE exams after the facilities shut. Results for children eligible for free school meals were 12% lower and it found that those who lost access to clubs were 14% more likely to commit crime.Prof Carmen Villa, of the University of Zurich’s Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development, who conducted the research, says: “Adolescence is a very critical period, where we know from neurological literature the brain is undergoing important changes.“A sense of belonging is critical,” she adds. “Any initiative that makes the most of that precious time and tries to do something about it can be very beneficial.”Share your experienceYou can share your experiences of living in a coastal town using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The letter was first reported by the Associated Press.The deal fits the administration’s contentious third-country deportation push, which has alarmed human rights monitors. UN expertswarned in Julythe policy could see people removed to foreign countries within a single day, without adequate legal safeguards or chance to raise torture or persecution concerns.Washington has approachedat least 58 governmentsabout accepting deportees, often securing agreements through cash payments or diplomatic pressure including travel ban threats. Nearly all the countries involved – including Eswatini, South Sudan and El Salvador – feature in state department reports for serious human rights abuses.“Implementing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies is a top priority for the Department of State,” said a state department spokesperson in response to an inquiry from the Guardian. “As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security.“We have no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments,” the response added.Christopher Landau, the US deputy secretary of state, met in September with Obiang, the vice-president, who was convicted by a Parisian court in 2017 of embezzling tens of millions of euros and laundering the proceeds in France. The US Department of Justice in 2012 determined he had spent $315m around the world on properties, supercars and other luxury goods. The US ultimately seized more than $27m from the official, including properties, luxury cars and a white jewel-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson during his Bad tour.During the meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Landau and Obiang “reaffirmed joint commitments to deepen commercial and economic ties, combat illegal immigration, and advance security cooperation”, the state department said. Obiang in late October confirmed he would cooperate with the Trump administration on the “orderly reception of undocumented immigrants, under strict joint protocols designed to guarantee a safe and coordinated process”.Observers noted that the deal was conducted in relative secrecy for an administration that has been proud of its efforts to hammer out agreements for the deportation of third-country nationals (TCNs) who could not be sent back to their home countries.“Knowing that this was a direct transfer of money to a government that is highly corrupt ... was a red flag,” said a congressional aide, who called the deal a “notable, egregious agreement”.Funds for Migration and Refugee Assistance are traditionally used for “responding to refugee and humanitarian crises overseas”, said the aide, such as those in Gaza or Sudan, rather than the removal of non-citizens from the US.There are “plenty of places where these funds should be used to support refugees overseas in the midst of conflict or humanitarian crises. There’s certainly need. So again, why are we sending this to Equatorial Guinea?”Another congressional Democratic aide said it’s possible the state department only shared the agreement with Republican lawmakers, who have been “grossly partisan recently – even more than usual”.The office of James Risch, a Republican senator, who chairs the foreign relations committee, did not immediately return a request for comment on how long the agreement has been on the table.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationEquatorial GuineaUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Originally called the Edo Museum of West African Art, it is in what was once the capital of the ancient Benin empire, whose vassal states included modern-day Lagos. Benin City is now the capital of Edo state.The museum, which is co-funded by the French and German governments as well as private donors, was supposed to host several of the Benin bronzes – the name given to artefacts looted by British soldiers during a punitive expedition in 1897 that were then scattered across collections in Europe and America. About 40 miles (65km) north of Mowaa is asmaller museumdedicated to the victim of a similar British expedition four years earlier.More than 150 original bronzes have been returned toNigeriaover the last five years from European state museums and private collections, as the west attempts to atone for its past.However, a rivalry between Edo state’s former and current governors, who belong to different political parties, means none of the bronzes will be on public display at Mowaa.The current administration is allied to Ewuare II, the spiritual and cultural leader of the Edo people. In March 2023, Nigeria’s federal governmentsided with Ewuare,a former diplomat who has long posited that the artefacts should be housed at the Benin palace because they were looted from there.Restitution row: how Nigeria’s new home for the Benin bronzes ended up with clay replicasRead moreIn its statement, Mowaa distanced itself from the state government, saying it was an independent, nonprofit institution, of which the former governor had no interest financial or otherwise. It also advised against any visits to the campus until further notice.Nigeria’s culture minister, Hannatu Musawa, said: “The reported disruption at Mowaa not only endangers a treasured cultural asset but also threatens the peaceful environment necessary for cultural exchange and the preservation of our artistic patrimony.”The incident drew mixed reactions across Nigeria, with some calling for a quick resolution as the country seeks to consolidate its standing as a cultural superpower.“This is not good optics for Edo state and not also for Nigeria,” the Lagos-based Zero Prive gallery said in a post on Instagram. “We stand in support of Mowaa as an independent body. Whatever political issues or differences let it be sorted out in the interest of the people of Edo state and the country.”Explore more on these topicsNigeriaMuseumsAfricaBritish empireProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

According to reports, Iswap reportedly incurred more personnel losses and several boats used in the assault were seized byBoko Haramforces.“From the toll we got, around 200 Iswap terrorists were killed in the fight,” Babakura Kolo, a member of a vigilante group that works with the Nigerian military, told Agence France-Presse.“We are aware of the fighting which is good news to us,” AFP also quoted a Nigerian intelligence source as saying. The source added that the casualty total was “more than 150”.Iswap began as a splinter group from Boko Haram that allied with IS. Since the split in 2016, both factions have fought repeatedly, primarily in the Lake Chad basin area. Other groups have since split from Boko Haram, drifting to other parts of northern Nigeria.The lake has lost more than 90% of its surface area since the 1960s, according to the UN Environment Programme. As the water recedes, new land routes across the territory open up.By many analyst accounts, Iswap was long considered the stronger and more resourceful of the two factions, but Boko Haram was seen as successful in the fight to occupy the Lake Chad area. Sunday’s clash was potentially the deadliest between them yet.In May 2021, Iswap launched an offensive on Sambisa, the forest enclave that was Boko Haram’s longtime base, and where it kept abducted schoolgirls. It is believed that Abubakar Shekau, the infamous leader of Boko Haram, killed himself during a clash with Iswap in Sambisa.Between December 2022 and January 2023, Boko Haram also launched big raids on two Iswap bases in Borno state, thebirthplace of the group’s radical ideology. Caches of weapons were seized as more than 100 Iswap fighters were killed and 35 others injured, according to reports by local newspapers the Guardian Nigeria and Punch.After theextrajudicial killingin 2009 of Shekau’s predecessor, Mohammed Yusuf, a jihadist conflict has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced around 2 million in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim north-east.Explore more on these topicsNigeriaBoko HaramIslamic StateAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He served only two months of an 18-month prison term, mostly in the prison’s hospital wing, before he was released as part of a decision affecting certain nonviolent offenders approved by the president, Cyril Ramaphosa.His jailing sparked riots inthe provinces of Gauteng, which is home to the economic capital of Johannesburg and KwaZulu-Natal, whose capital is Durban.More than 350 people were killed and the economy ravaged in what was considered the worst episode of domestic unrest since the end of apartheid.View image in fullscreenDuduzile Zuma-Sambudla joined the party of her father, Jacob Zuma, after he left the ANC.Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty ImagesProsecutors accuse Zuma-Sambudla, 43, of playing a key role in inciting the violence through social media activity.She has denied the allegations and at a preliminary hearing wore a T-shirt with the words “Modern Day Terrorist” – a seemingly satirical retort to the charges.Zuma-Sambudla followed her father when he left the ruling African National Congress in 2023 to found uMkhonto weSizwe(MK), the nationalist party named after the ANC’s former militant wing. She has become one of his most trusted allies and was elected to the national assembly in last year’s election on MK’s platform.In court on Monday, Zuma-Sambudla smiled and seemed under no pressure. Her father, who was in power for nine years, was in court to support his daughter, who was born in Mozambique while he was in exile.Prosecutors said 164 WhatsApp social media chat groups were created to coordinate the riots in 2021 and that Zuma-Sambudla “intentionally and unlawfully encouraged the public to act in acts of violence under the guise of freeingJacob Zumafrom incarceration”.A representative of the Jacob Zuma Foundation claimed the case was the latest example of the state’s targeted prosecution of the family.“For more than two decades, state institutions have been selectively mobilised to destroy President Zuma and those associated with him,” said Mzwanele Manyi. “The state’s case rests on a bizarre premise: that her social media posts during July 2021 somehow ‘incited’ unrest. In truth, her posts were reactive commentaries on events already unfolding, as millions of South Africans expressed anguish and frustration at the unlawful imprisonment of a liberation hero.”Most of the alleged corruption under investigation by the commission involved the Guptas, three brothers from a wealthy Indian business family who won lucrative government contracts and were allegedly even able to choose cabinet ministers.Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaJacob ZumaANC (African National Congress)AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But police did not provide further details about the occupants of the plane and did not immediately return messages seeking more details.Mike Moser, the Coral Springs-Parkland fire department deputy chief, said emergency crews responded within minutes of a call reporting the crash. Initially, no victims were located during rescue efforts and they shifted to a recovery operation. Moser said no homes were damaged, but crews spotted some debris near the retention pond. Local aerial televised footage showed a broken fence in the back yard of one home bordering the pond where the plane went down.‘We need help’: devastated Jamaican communities still await aid after Hurricane MelissaRead more“There was no actual plane to be seen,” Moser said. “They followed the debris trail to the water. We had divers that entered the water and tried to search for any victims and didn’t find any.”Kenneth DeTrolio told the SouthFloridaSun Sentinel he and his wife were in their home when the plane crashed through their back yard, destroying his fence and toppling palm trees before hitting the water. He said the impact left debris scattered across his yard and that his pool and back porch were “contaminated” with spilled fuel.The fuel smell was so strong inside his home that it took a few hours to dissipate, he added.“We heard the strangest sound. I never heard anything like it before, and apparently that was when this plane must have flown between my home and my neighbor’s house,” DeTrolio told the newspaper.Officials cautioned residents that police would maintain a significant presence in the area as investigators continue collecting evidence.Broward county, where the plane took off from and where the crash occurred, is home to a vibrant Caribbean American community that sprang into action to collect relief supplies afterHurricane Melissa. A powerful category 5 hurricane, Melissa slammed into Jamaica late last month, leaving a path of destruction.Moser said police would take over recovery efforts, and federal aviation officials would investigate the cause of the crash.The small Beechcraft King Air plane took off from the Fort Lauderdale executive airport at approximately 10.14am, according to a spokesperson for the city of Fort Lauderdale, which owns and operates the airport. The crash occurred soon after takeoff, with Coral Springs police officers and firefighters responding at 10.19am, just five minutes later.According to Federal Aviation Administration records, the plane was manufactured in 1976. King Air models can seat between seven and 12 people, according to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.Federal records showed the registered owner of the plane was listed as International Air Services, a company that markets itself as specializing in providing trust agreements to non-US citizens that enable them to register their aircraft with the FAA. A person who answered the company’s phone declined to answer questions from a reporter, stating “no comment” and ending the call.The flight tracking website FlightAware shows the plane made four other trips to or from Jamaica in the past week, traveling between George Town in the Cayman Islands and Montego Bay and Negril in Jamaica, before landing in Fort Lauderdale on Friday. It was not immediately clear who was organizing the trips.Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on 28 October, tied for the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane in history. The storm also caused devastation in Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic and prompted relief organizations to mobilize.Local government officials in Jamaica said in the days after the storm that Melissa had ripped the roofs off 120,000 structures, affecting about 90,000 families in the island’s especially hard-hit western region. A week after Melissa’s landfall in Jamaica, more than 2,000 people were still reported to be in shelters.Explore more on these topicsFloridaJamaicaAir transportHurricane MelissaPlane crashesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The Chinese government rejects accusations of forced labour, claiming Uyghur work programmes are for poverty alleviation.In October, Sheffield Hallam lifted the ban, and apologised to Murphy. But the case has caused widespread alarm about the influence of the Chinese government on UK universities, both in the form of specific threats and fears of losing access to the lucrative market of Chinese international students.Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said: “From what we have heard so far, Chinese government interference in our universities is a threat. We need to examine the extent of it and universities should have a co-ordinated response to it”.Last week, the Sheffield Hallam branch of the University and College Union (UCU) and the national executive committee of the UCU passed motions calling for a “full public inquiry” into the events at Sheffield Hallam. The motions also called for a government-led review into the ways in which commercial considerations are eroding academic free speech.Similar motions are expected to be tabled at regional UCU branches in the coming weeks.Bob Jeffrey, a branch officer for the Sheffield Hallam UCU, said: “Laura’s case really resonates with UCU members”. Academics in the UK havespoken outabout “extremely heaving” pressure from Beijing in the wake of the revelations about Sheffield Hallam.Internal emails from Sheffield Hallam revealed that Murphy’s work and the university’s business interests in China were considered to be “untenable bedfellows”. The university said the emails did not represent university policy and that the decision to block Murphy’s research was not based on commercial interests.Separately, Sheffield Hallam has beenreferred to counter-terrorism policeover concerns that it assisted a foreign intelligence service, in this case China, when it blocked Murphy’s research.Staff at Sheffield Hallam are going on strike on Tuesday amid concerns about job cuts and the university’s handling of Murphy’s case.Jo Grady, the general secretary of the UCU, said: “It is incredibly worrying that Sheffield Hallam appears to have attempted to silence its own professor on behalf of a foreign government”.There has been growing concern for years that the higher education sector’s dependence on international student fees from China is a vulnerability for universities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They pay billions in tuition fees, which many universities see as an economic lifeline.Collaboration with Chinese students is also seen as beneficial to the UK’s own research output, particularly in science and technology fields, although some have warned of the security risks of certain types of joint research projects.In 2023, parliament’s intelligence and security committeewarnedthat China could gain political influence and economic advantages in the UK by “controlling the narrative of debate about China within UK universities” by exerting influence on academics and Chinese students.The UK ranks at thetop of a listof countries affected by Chinese government influence in academia on the China Index, a project by Doublethink Lab that monitors Chinese overseas influence.Beijing has reacted strongly to the reports about Sheffield Hallam, with one article in the state-run Global Times stating: “Western scholars essentially only have the freedom to express anti-China sentiments, not the right to conduct free research”.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said: “China firmly opposes activities by any institution or individual to slander and smear China by fabricating falsehoods and spreading lies.“The individual concerned has herself admitted to the media that she received funding and support from US government agencies and other sources to conduct this so-called ‘research’, which specifically aims at attacking China’s Xinjiang policies. It is evident that what she is doing is part of the disgraceful political campaign of defaming China under the disguise of ‘academic freedom’ or ‘freedom of speech’.”Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsHouse of CommonsUniversitiesHigher educationChinaEmily ThornberryAsia PacificSheffield Hallam UniversitynewsShareReuse this content"

Prabowo has always denied wrongdoing in relation to the claims.Defending the bestowal of hero status on Suharto, Indonesia’s culture minister, Fadli Zon, said Suharto was worthy of the award because of the military operations he was involved in, including fighting against the Dutch in 1949. He denied that Suharto was involved in the massacre of at least half a million suspected Communists in 1965-66.But Indonesian activists have described the elevation of Suharto as shocking.View image in fullscreenA protester sorts posters at a rally last week against Indonesia granting Suharto national hero status.Photograph: Achmad Ibrahim/AP“How could the man most responsible for one of history’s greatest genocides, when he seized power, be made a national hero?

This decision ignores the aspirations of civil society, including victims of human rights violations who continue to demand justice.”The government did not immediately provide comment to these claims.Talk of naming Suharto a national hero has also sparked protests in Jakarta, where in recent days demonstrators have rallied near the presidential palace holding signs saying “Stop the whitewashing of the general of butchery” and “Thousands died but the country chose to forget”.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaPrabowo SubiantoAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The weather system prompted warnings for heavy rainfall and life-threatening storm surges across much of the country, with sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h) and gusts of about 140mph recorded on Sunday by the national meteorological agency.By the time Fung-Wong moves past the Philippines early this week, more than 200mm of rainfall is expected to have fallen on Luzon, the country’s most populous island.This follows Typhoon Kalmaegi, which struck less than a week ago andleft at least 224 people dead in the Philippines. The arrival of Typhoon Fung-Wong has forced authorities to suspend rescue operations for more than 100 missing people.After crossing Luzon, Fung-Wong is expected to move north-westwards into the South China Sea by Tuesday, before veering north towards Taiwan. Although there is some variability in its track, Taiwan is likely to face heavy rain, strong winds and flooding midweek.Meanwhile, parts of south-western Europe will experience heavy rain, particularly across the Iberian peninsula. Cumulative rainfall by the end of the week will exceed 100mm across westernPortugaland Spain’s Galicia region, with totals exceeding 200mm more locally. Strong winds are also expected on Tuesday as gusts top 60mph.View image in fullscreenAn iguana, stunned from the cold, is retrieved after falling from a tree in West Palm Beach, Florida.Photograph: Greg Lovett/Zuma/Rex/ShutterstockAcross the Atlantic, the south-eastern US is braced for its first significant cold spell of the season as polar air pushes south. Temperatures in northernFloridaare expected to drop about 15C (30F) below the average for the time of year. After a warm weekend – with highs in the Florida panhandle approaching 30C on Saturday – a plunge to about 0C 7am local time on Tuesday will come as a shock.One striking – and unusual – consequence of this sharp temperature drop is that local iguanas are expected to succumb to the frigid conditions and fall from the trees where they usually perch. As cold-blooded reptiles, iguanas become temporarily paralysed when temperatures dip below 10C, causing them to lose their grip. Authorities have issued warnings, particularly for Tuesday morning, urging people to watch out for falling iguanas from trees and other unexpected places.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentWeather trackerPhilippinesAsia PacificExtreme weatherFloridaSpainPortugalanalysisShareReuse this content"

The state’s population – estimated at 6.9 million by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2024 – is forecast to increase by 4 million people in the next 30 years.The changes are also designed to make the most ofMelbourne’s new Metro Tunnelwhich is due to begin taking passengers in December.View image in fullscreenInfrastructure Victoria says without more northern train services, more residents in Coburg and Brunswick could soon be forced to drive to work.Illustration: Infrastructure VictoriaInfrastructure Victoria chief executive, Dr Jonathan Spear, said the report, which calls for a $65bn spend over three decades, was predicated on “how can we make best use of those investments that we’ve made already”, including existing infrastructure.Some of the recommendations, includingreducing speed limits to 30km/hin areas with children and the creation of separated bicycle corridors in Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and Wangaratta, were made public in a draft plan in March.But after feedback, a new recommendation has called for changes which would allow more train services to run in Melbourne’s north, with modelling showing many residents of suburbs including Coburg and Brunswick could soon be forced to drive to work.The report says they already wait up to 20 minutes for trains during peak times, four to five times longer than stations in Melbourne’s south-east located a similar distance from the CBD. Trams on Sydney Road are up to 27% slower than the network average due to mixed traffic and predicted to get 4% slower by 2041.InfrastructureVictoriasays upgrades to power and signalling in the City Loop, where space has been freed up by the Metro Tunnel, and building an extra track on the Upfield line, would allow nine trains to run an hour rather than four.It has also modelled tram extensions that make the most of capacity changes created by the Metro Tunnel’s new stations, calling for the expansion of eight routes over five years at a cost of up to $5.7bn, to encourage the construction of more new homes nearby.View image in fullscreenInfrastructure Victoria has recommended the extension of eight Melbourne tram routes by 2031, including long-promised connections to Chadstone and Fishermans Bend.Photograph: Infrastructure VictoriaThat includes linking routes 11 and 67 to Fishermans Bend, where the government plans for 80,000 people to live by 2050, and extending route 3 to Hughesdale via Chadstone. Tram services to Fishermans Bend and Chadstone were promised in 2018 but have not eventuated.The report also identifies Melbourne’s rapidly growing west as poorly served by buses and metropolitan trains, with 63% of residents driving to work compared with 32% in inner Melbourne.It has called for the extension of Metro train services to Melton, additional tracks from Sunshine to Caroline Springs, as well as new train stations at Thornhill Park, Mount Atkinson and Altona North.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not just Scott Morrison’s 2050 target – any target at all.The united front appeared to corner Ley, for whom net zero emissions is not just a policy question but a proxy battle for the leadership.Since the right-faction’s coordinated intervention, furious moderate Liberals have waged a public and private campaign to salvage some commitment to net zero – even if not the mid-century deadline promised under Morrison.“They didn’t realise how pissed off we would be,” one moderate Liberal said.One goal of the pro-net zero Liberals has been to ensure there is a “transaction cost” – a political price to pay – if the climate target is to be dumped or watered downed.On Sunday, the moderate Liberal senator,Andrew Bragg, threatened to quit the shadow ministryif the party walked away from the Paris agreement and any commitment to net zero.On Monday, in less explicit terms,Bragg’s factional ally, Maria Kovacic, issued much the same ultimatum.“As with any area of policy, if the party room decides on a policy that a shadow minister cannot publicly support, they would have to resign and move to the backbench,” she told the Nine papers.The message was clear. If Ley dumps net zero in its entirety she could pay the price of losing MPs who are propping up her fragile leadership.How other moderates on the frontbench, including Tim Wilson and Anne Ruston, intend to react to the possible junking of net zero is less clear.The risks of resignation doesn’t just rest on one outcome.A senior Liberal source told Guardian Australia that some members of the shadow ministry who want net zero dumped would need to consider their position if a firm target was retained.Ley may yet be able to escape with a compromise.Guardian Australia spoke to several MPs on Monday who believe there is some cross-factional support for a position in which the party drops net zero, or preserves it as a vague “aspiration”, but remains committed to the Paris agreement.The Nationals would probably accept that approach given it largely reflects their own.Such a position could keep Ley’s frontbench, leadership and the Liberal-NationalCoalitionin tact – for now.But it would leave the leader, and what few genuinely climate-conscious MPs remain, saddled with a policy that could barely be less credible.It doesn’t take an expert in international climate negotiations to know that a future Coalition government would be in flagrant breach of the Paris agreement if it were to “backslide” on Australia’s existing commitments, which include net zero by 2050.Australia would not need to formally withdraw from Paris – as Donald Trump has twice done with the US – to make itself an international pariah on climate action once again.Dan Jervis-Bardy is the chief political correspondent for Guardian Australia, based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsLiberal partyCoalitionSussan LeyAustralian politicsGreenhouse gas emissionsParis climate agreementNational partyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Other changes include a new offence for the possession of a commercial quantity of illicit tobacco, with a maximum penalty of over $1.5m and seven years’ imprisonment, or both.Last week, Park said closures would “be done every day for the next few days and weeks ahead”, but said it was important to “manage expectations”.The NSW government has said it is uncertain how many unlicensed retailers selling tobacco there are in the state, after initial estimates of about 19,000.The NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, has said this likely included former retailers who had not deregistered from the previous scheme.A new tobacco licensing scheme also requires retailers to display a valid licence at the point of sale or risk fines from $11,000 to $44,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News USFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The federal treasurer, Jim Chalmers, hasrebuffed calls, saying he did not think the answer was “to make cigarettes cheaper for people”.Minns told the ABC last week the excise was the “leading reason” for the recent boom in illegal tobacco use, which had seen Sydney “going back to the 90s”, with people congregating outside office blocks and football games to smoke.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesTobacco industryVapingBusinessLaw (Australia)SydneynewsShareReuse this content"

If I knew, so should he. [So] to say this is a failure of communication is an understatement. This is a failure to be politically attuned to the implications of something like this.”Lanyon has blamed an “internal communication error” for allowinga form 1 applicationfor the protest to be approved by local police area command.On Monday, the Herald reproduced what it said was a copy of a form 1 application for the protest approved by police, naming the applicant as Jack Eltis, “on behalf of White Australia, formerly the National Socialist Network”.The application, dated 27 October, said a proposed banner would read “Abolish the Jewish Lobby”. The application also said the group was protesting new hate speech laws, claiming they “had been driven by misleading claims and undue pressure from various Jewish advocacy groups”.NSW police would not comment on the document’s authenticity.Lanyon told the ABC the NSW police had received an application for the rally on 28 October, but it wasn’t raised directly with him.Lanyon said police had sought legal advice regarding the banner.The application was approved after police chose not to oppose it within seven days.Speaking on ABC’s 7.30 program on Monday, Lanyon said he was “disappointed” he wasn’t briefed on the form 1 application given it was “high profile”.“I want to make sure that I’m certainly over those matters of significance,” he said.Lanyon said there was “nothing there” in the application that indicated there was a risk to public safety if the protest went ahead and he was “satisfied” that the appropriate process was followed.But he said if he had been briefed, he would have asked to see if there were sufficient grounds to object to the protest in the supreme court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked if the premier’s staff received a similar warning, Minns’ office deferred to the premier’s previous comments.A spokesperson for the NSW parliament said they could not comment on security matters.On Monday, the premier told the reporters the decision to allow Saturday’s rally “obviously didn’t go to my office”.He said a review into Saturday’s rally, as well as another by the same group outside parliament in June, “would look at what communication took place between police and the premier’s department and the premier’s office”.“I don’t know whether an errant email in the scores of communications referenced either of the rallies in the previous month. We’ll have a closer look at that.”Piper said after he was told his request to move the protest was not achievable, he asked additional security personnel, including special constables, to be on-site during the rally. “I just asked if they could make sure if there were people around,” he said.More than 60 members of the neo-Nazi National Socialist Network stood in formation on Macquarie Street outside on Saturday morning, bearing a large banner that read “Abolish the Jewish Lobby”.Piper said he saw the rally being allowed to go ahead as a “failure”.“We are a democratic society. This group can parade within reason, they can protest, as others do … but I don’t think the parliament should be acquiescent to such a hate group.”“They’ve completely been successful in what they set out to do,” he said.“They’ve created these images of themselves in front of the most important building representing democracy in NSW, and the oldest public building in Australia, with a very ugly message.“I’m looking forward to discussing it further to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he said.”Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesFar rightChris MinnsAllegra SpenderAustralian police and policingNew South Wales politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

His case will be expedited, and he will be returned to France as quickly as possible. The message is clear: if you try to return to the UK you will be sent back. We will do whatever it takes to scale up removals of illegal migrants and secure our borders.”Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said the government was “mired in migrant chaos and has clearly lost control of our borders”.He added: “Since the French returns deal was announced, only a handful of illegal immigrants have been returned to France while around 20,000 have arrived here – 99.5% are being allowed to stay and only 0.5% returned to France. This will clearly have no deterrent effect whatsoever.”The Home Office has not yet confirmed the total number of people who arrived on Sunday but it was estimated to be nearly 400.They followed 1,772 who crossed in 25 boats on Thursday, Friday and Saturday as people smugglers took advantage of calmer conditions in the Channel.Under the “one in, one out” scheme, British officials are detaining some of those who cross the Channel and sending them back to France. In return for each person removed, the UK is taking an asylum seeker in France who can show they have family connections in Britain.The deal was announced in July by Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron. Speaking at a joint press conference, the prime minister said: “There is no silver bullet here, but with a united effort, new tactics and a new level of intent, we can finally turn the tables.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceMigrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The Turkish football federation (TFF) has also suspended 1,024 players pending disciplinary investigations.The TFFsuspended 149 referees and assistant refereesearlier this month, after an investigation found officials working in the country’s professional leagues were betting on football matches.Turkey’s state-owned Anadolu news agency reported that a court had ruled to arrest the Eyupspor chairman, Murat Özkaya, and seven others as part of the investigation. Eyupspor, who play in the top-tier Turkish Super Lig, were not immediately available to comment.In a statement, the TFF said it had sent 1,024 players from all leagues to the Professional Football Disciplinary Council (PFDK) as part of the investigation, including 27 players from the Super Lig, who have all been suspended. Among those 27 were players from champions Galatasaray and Istanbul rivals Besiktas, among others.“Due to the precautionary transfer of 1,024 football players to the PFDK, negotiations have been initiated urgently with Fifa to grant a 15-day transfer and registration period in addition to the 2025-2026 winter transfer period, only at the national level, in order for clubs to complete their squad deficiencies,” the TFF said.It also said matches in the second- and third-tier leagues were suspended for two weeks, while local media said the TFF board would hold an extraordinary meeting at 2pm (GMT) on Tuesday.Football’s world governing body, Fifa, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the investigation and the TFF’s request for a 15-day transfer window.The TFF president, Ibrahim Haciosmanoglu, has described the situation as a “moral crisis in Turkish football”. Its own investigation revealed that 371 of 571 active referees in Turkey’s professional leagues had betting accounts, and 152 of them were actively gambling.One referee had placed bets 18,227 times and 42 referees had bet on more than 1,000 football matches each. Others were found to have bet only once.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballTurkeyEuropeRefereesSport bettingnewsShareReuse this content"

I will now prepare for an appeal. My energy is focused solely on proving my innocence. The truth will prevail.”Sarkozy went to prison on 21 October, after a Paris court gave him afive-year sentence for criminal conspiracyover a scheme to obtain election campaign funds for his 2007 presidential race from the regime of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.He denies wrongdoing and has appealed against that verdict, with a fresh trial on appeal scheduled for next spring. Judges ruled last month that, because of the “exceptional gravity” of his conviction, he must go to prison while the appeals process took its course.A Paris appeal court on Monday granted Sarkozy’s request for release, however. Under the terms of his release, Sarkozy will be forbidden from talking to any officials from the justice ministry, including the justice minister, Gérald Darmanin.Darmanin, who once considered Sarkozy as his mentor before rejoining Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party in 2017, visited the former president in prison last month. Some French magistrates criticised the move as undermining the independence of judges.Sarkozy will also be forbidden from talking to others involved in the case, and will be banned from leavingFrance.Speaking by video link to the appeal court on Monday morning, Sarkozy, dressed in a navy blue suit, appeared on camera from prison, seated at a table with his lawyers beside him. He told the court: “I want to pay tribute to all the prison staff, who are exceptionally humane, and who have made this nightmare bearable – because it is a nightmare.”He added: “I never had any idea or intention to ask Mr Gaddafi for any kind of financing … I will never confess to something I didn’t do … I never imagined that at 70 years of age, I’d be in prison. It’s an ordeal that has been imposed on me. I confess it’s hard, it’s very hard. It leaves a mark on any prisoner because it’s gruelling.”Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement for his own security, in an individual cell of about 9 sq metres with his own shower and toilet. Two bodyguards occupied a neighbouring cell to ensure his safety. The French news weekly Le Point reported that he had been eating only yoghurts in prison as he feared any food might have been spat on. He had facilities to cook for himself but refused this, the magazine reported, citing unnamed sources.Sarkozy’s lawyer, Christophe Ingrain, who had visited him every day, said Sarkozy would be safer out of prison than inside. “He has faced death threats, has heard screaming at night and the urgent intervention in a neighbouring cell when a prisoner self-harmed.”View image in fullscreenCarla Bruni-Sarkozy was in court for the release request hearing on Monday morning, along with Sarkozy’s two oldest sons.Photograph: Raphaël Lafargue/ABACA/ShutterstockSarkozy, who served as France’s rightwing president between 2007 and 2012, was the first former head of an EU country to serve time in prison, and the first French postwar leader to go behind bars.Bruno Retailleau, the head of Sarkozy’s rightwing party, Les Républicains, wrote on social media that Sarkozy’s release had been expected, saying he had “faced this ordeal with courage and determination.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the state prosecutor appealed against the acquittals, Sarkozy will be retried on all the charges next year, including criminal conspiracy.Although the allegations of a secret campaign funding pact with the Libyan regime formed the biggest corruption trial Sarkozy had faced, he had already been convicted in two separate cases and stripped of France’s highest distinction, the Légion d’honneur.Sarkozy had previously become the first former French head of state forced to wear an electronic tag after being convicted in a separate case of corruption and influence-peddling over illegal attempts to secure favours from a judge.In that case, he was given a one-year jail term but was able to serve it with an electronic ankle tag. He wore the tag for three months before being granted conditional release.Explore more on these topicsNicolas SarkozyFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Ukrainian mediaidentified one of them as Timur Mindich, a businessman and associate of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Mindichreportedly fled abroadhours before investigators arrived at his Kyiv apartment to carry out a search. He is the co-owner of Kvartal 95, the media production company Zelenskyy founded before he became president.The two were friends and business partners in the years before Zelenskyy went into politics. According to one source, there has been much less communication since Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly four years ago.In a statement the national anti-corruption bureau (Nabu) said several individuals had formed a criminal gang and built “a large-scale corruption scheme to influence strategic enterprises in the public sector, in particular Energoatom”. It forced Energoatom’s counterparties to pay kickbacks of 10-15% in order to avoid having payments for services or goods blocked, or losing their supplier status, the bureau alleged.Asked about Mindich, a senior official in Zelenskyy’s office said Ukraine’s government supported “all activities that stamped out corruption”. They said evidence collected by Nabu and other independent bodies should be tested in court.The case highlights long-running tensions between the presidential administration and Ukraine’s two leading anti-corruption agencies. In July Zelenskyyapproved a contentious billthat weakened the powers of Nabu and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office.The move triggered the first serious protests against his government. Several thousand demonstratorsgathered outside the president’s office in Kyiv. They waved banners and shouted slogans including “Shame” and “Veto the law”, after Ukraine’s parliament approved the measure.Zelenskyy climbed down in the face of popular opposition and after fielding calls from European allies who raised concerns. New legislation was hastily passed to restore the agencies’ powers and it appeared to guarantee their independence.Eradicating graft and shoring up the rule of law are key requirements forKyivto join the EU, which Ukrainians see as critical to their future as Russia’s war continues to rage.Ukraine’s power system has been significantly damaged by a campaign of Kremlin bombardment this autumn, causing huge power cuts for people across the country. Russia has not hit nuclear plants but has damaged substations connected to them.In an interview with the Guardianpublished on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Vladimir Putin was carrying out deliberate “terrorist acts” against civilians, leaving them without power and water. During the conversation in the presidential palace in Kyiv, the lights went off twice.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUkraineKyivEnergy industryEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

The meeting is part of a remarkable turnaround in US-Syrian relations after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, who had prosecuted a deadly civil war in the country from 2011 until his forces collapsed in December 2024.Sharaa, a former al-Qaida-aligned rebel fighter who had previously had a $10m bounty on his head, arrived at the White House on Monday in a dark suit and red tie as he sought to lobby Trump for sanction relief for the former pariah state. Video showed him greeting a crowd of supporters outside in a rare public appearance.“He’s a very strong leader,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “He comes from a very tough place. Tough guy. I like him. I get along with the president, the new president in Syria, and we’ll do everything we can to make Syria successful, because that’s part of the Middle East.”After the meeting, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, announced a 180-day suspension of some sanctions under the Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019, commonly called the Caesar Act, which targets Syria’s energy industry and deterred foreign investors from signing contracts relating to the country’s postwar reconstruction.The exemptions excluded “certain transactions involving the governments of Russia and Iran, or the transfer of provisions of Russian-origin or Iranian-origin goods, technology, software, funds, financing or services”.Announcing the sanctions and export control reliefs, the US government said in a press release: “President Trump is delivering on his commitment to give Syria ‘a chance at greatness’ and to let them rebuild and thrive by lifting US sanctions and ensuring accountability for harmful actors.”Sharaa is a former rebel and leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which was affiliated with al-Qaida and had been designated as a terrorist organisation by the US. But after his forces toppled Assad, HTS was removed from the list of foreign terrorist organisations, and the bounty on Sharaa was rescinded.The US had said it wanted Syria tojoin a US-led coalition against Islamic State, while Syria had said that it planned to reopen its embassy in Washington after it was closed more than a decade ago under Assad.That announcement was not made on Monday, although Sharaa said the sides had come to a “political” agreement.Asked whether further announcements about Syria’s joining the coalition against Islamic State or on a security pact with Israel, Trump said: “Yes, you can expect an announcement on Syria. We want to see Syria become a country that’s very successful.”Syria’s foreign ministry said it had agreed with the US to integrate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces into the Syrian army.Explore more on these topicsSyriaDonald TrumpMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Azerbaijan, once mooted as a contributor, did not attend a planning meeting in Turkey last week and said it would not contribute unless a full ceasefire was in place.The UAE’s decision, announced by the senior envoy Dr Anwar Gargash at a conference in Abu Dhabi, reflects Arab doubts about the terms of a US-drafted resolution already distributed to diplomats at the UN in New York. The draft places an onus on a US-directed stabilisation force to be the principal means of imposing security inGazaafter Israel has left the territory.Unrwa has the capacity and expertise to support a postwar Gaza. We want to help make this peace work | Philippe LazzariniRead moreGargash said: “The UAE does not yet see a clear framework for the stability force and under such circumstances will not participate, but will support all political efforts towards peace – and remain at the forefront of humanitarian aid.”The Arab states would like greater responsibilities to be given to a separate Palestinian civilian police force. International law would also forbid foreign troops from entering occupiedPalestineunless there was explicit Palestinian consent, otherwise the force would be seen as coercive under UN law, and arguably stabilising an unlawful Israeli occupation.Jamal Nusseibeh, a Palestinian American co-author of the Palestinian armistice plan, said: “It is critical that the force be deployed not to stabilise the unlawful Israeli occupation, but to enforce international law and end it. The force will work as long as it enters the entire occupied territory, including theWest Bank, at the request of Palestine, and has a clear objective to end the occupation within the context of a sovereign Palestinian state.”There is no reference to the West Bank in the US draft resolution, or to a Palestinian state, or a two-state solution, a prospect Israel opposes.Detailed negotiations on the stabilisation force mandate, including its command and control, started formally on Thursday in New York, and look likely to be protracted – risking the development of a vacuum in Gaza that may strengthen Hamas.The US is proposing that it lead the force although it will not have many troops involved on the ground. It has already in effect taken control of the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza from a new civil military coordination centre based in Israel.The draft US resolution defines the purpose of a stabilisation force as “along with the newly trained and vetted police force to help secure border areas, stabilise the security environment in Gaza by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding the military terror and offensive infrastructure as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups”.The force, answerable to a “board of peace” chaired by Donald Trump, and not to the UN, would be required to use “all necessary measures” to achieve its objectives.Arab states including Qatar are also concerned that this mandate is too expansive, and if Hamas is to disarm that the group will only do so to fellow Palestinians, probably in the civilian police force, at a moment that, from the Hamas perspective, marks the end of occupation.They also fear the draft mandate spills into giving the stabilisation force a governance role in Gaza, a task that was to be set aside for a Palestinian technocratic committee working in conjunction with a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA).This “transitional governance administration” in Gaza would remain until “the Palestinian Authority has satisfactorily completed its reform programme, the satisfaction of which shall be acceptable to the BoP [board of peace]”, the draft says. It also “underscores the importance” of full humanitarian aid in Gaza, including through the UN, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the Red Crescent.However, it opens the door to the exclusion of “any organisation found to have misused such aid”. The phrase leaves open the board of peace excluding Unrwa, the body that the international court of justice has said is the lawful distributor of aid.France andSaudi Arabiaare already pressing for a reference to a Palestinian state to be included in the resolution. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is due in the White House on 18 November, and Manal Radwan, from Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry, has said a reference to a Palestinian state is a prerequisite.The PA chair, Mahmoud Abbas, met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris on Monday to discuss the PA role.Neither the UN nor the 15-strong security council are given a supervisory role over the stabilisation force, overseeing the implementation of the resolution, a point largely overlooked by the draft text. Nothing is specified about the funding of this stabilisation mission, which, according to the Americans, should be largely borne by Gulf states, with Saudi Arabia taking the lead.Israel is seeking written guarantees from the US that it will be allowed to follow the pattern of Lebanon and reserve the right to re-enter Gaza if it believes disarmament is not taking place at the scale or pace it requires.The Israeli proposal was put to Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law, and the US special envoy, Steve Witkoff. Kushner was in Jerusalem on Monday to discuss progress on the ceasefire and Witkoff was due to arrive later the same day.The bodies of four of the original 251 Israeli hostages remain unreturned.Separately, Israel has been proposing that Gaza could yet be split in two, with reconstruction work starting in the Israel-occupied parts of the strip.

All pointed to the evaporation of the official code of conduct concerning civilians.The soldiers who agreed to talk confirmed the IDF’s routine use of human shields, contradicting official denials, and gave details of Israeli troops opening fire unprovoked on civilians racing to reach food handouts at the militarised distribution points set up by the US- and Israeli-backedGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF).“In basic training for the army, we all chanted ‘means, intent and ability’,” Capt Yotam Vilk, an armoured corps officer, says in reference to the official IDF training guidelines stipulating that a soldier can fire only if the target has the means, shows intent and has the ability to cause harm.“There’s no such thing as ‘means, intent and ability’ in Gaza,” Vilk says. “No soldier ever mentions ‘means, intent, and ability’. It’s just: a suspicion of walking where it’s not allowed. A man aged between 20 and 40.”Another soldier, identified in the programme only as Eli, says: “Life and death isn’t determined by procedures or opening fire regulations. It’s the conscience of the commander on the ground that decides.”In those circumstances, the designation of who is an enemy or terrorist becomes arbitrary, Eli says in the documentary. “If they’re walking too fast, they’re suspicious. If they’re walking too slow, they’re suspicious. They’re plotting something. If three men are walking and one of them lags behind, it’s a two-to-one infantry formation – it’s a military formation,” he says.Eli describes an incident in which a senior officer ordered a tank to demolish a building in an area designated as safe for civilians. “A man was standing on the roof, hanging laundry, and the officer decided that he was a spotter. He’s not a spotter. He’s hanging his laundry. You can see that he’s hanging laundry,” he says.“Now, it’s not as if this man had binoculars or weapons. The closest military force was 600-700 metres away. So unless he had eagle eyes, how could he possibly be a spotter? And the tank fired a shell. The building half collapsed. And the result was many dead and wounded.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians carry supplies from a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation site in the central Gaza Strip.Photograph: ReutersGuardian analysisin Augustof the IDF’s intelligence data showed that by the reckoning of Israeli military officials, 83% of those killed in Gaza were civilians, a historic high for modern conflicts, though the IDF disputed the analysis. More than 69,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war started and more continue to die despite a ceasefire that began a month ago.In a written statement, the IDF said: “The IDF remains committed to the rule of law and continues to operate in accordance with its legal and ethical obligations, despite the unprecedented operational complexity posed by Hamas’s systematic embedding within civilian infrastructure and its use of civilian sites for military purposes.”Some of the soldiers interviewed in the Breaking Ranks programme said they were influenced by the language of Israeli politicians and religious leaders suggesting that after the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed, every Palestinian was a legitimate target.A UN commissionconcluded in Septemberthat Israel had committed genocide in Gaza. On the question of intent, it pointed to incitement from Israeli leaders such as the president, Isaac Herzog, who shortly after the 7 October attack said: “It is an entire nation out there that is responsible. It is not true, this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved, it’s absolutely not true.”Daniel, the tank unit commander, says in the documentary that the rhetoric declaring there was no such thing as an innocent in Gaza seeped down into army ranks. “You hear that all the time, so you start to believe it,” he says.A spokesperson for Herzog said the Israeli president had been an outspoken voice for humanitarian causes and the protection of innocents.The programme also provides evidence that such views have been propagated by some rabbis in the ranks. “One time, the brigade rabbi sat down next to me and spent half an hour explaining why we must be just like they were on October 7. That we must take revenge on all of them, including civilians. That we shouldn’t discriminate, and that this is the only way,” says Maj Neta Caspin.Rabbi Avraham Zarbiv, an extremist Jewish cleric who served more than 500 days in Gaza, says in the programme: “Everything there is one big terrorist infrastructure.”Zarbiv has not only given religious legitimacy to the mass demolition of Palestinian neighbourhoods but drove military bulldozers himself and claims credit for pioneering a tactic that had been adopted by the IDF as a whole, pointing to the mass purchase of armoured bulldozers.“The IDF invests hundreds of thousands of shekels to destroy the Gaza Strip. We changed the conduct of an entire army,” Zarbiv says in the programme.The soldiers giving their accounts in Breaking Ranks also confirm consistent reports throughout the two-year conflict of the use of Palestinian civilians as human shields, a practice informally known as the “mosquito protocol”.“You send the human shield underground. As he walks down the tunnel, he maps it all for you. He has an iPhone in his vest and as he walks it sends back GPS information,” says Daniel, the tank commander, says in the documentary. “The commanders saw how it works. And the practice spread like wildfire. After about a week, every company was operating its own mosquito.”The IDF said in a statement that “the IDF prohibits the use of civilians as human shields or coercing them in any way to participate in military operations. These orders have been routinely emphasized to forces throughout the war.”“Allegations of misconduct are thoroughly examined, and when identifying details are provided, the matter is investigated in depth,” the IDF said. “In several cases, investigations have been opened by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) following suspicions involving Palestinians in military missions. These investigations remain ongoing.”The makers of Breaking Ranks spoke to a contractor identified only as Sam who worked at food distribution sites run by the GHF, who says he witnessed the IDF killing unarmed civilians.He describes an incident at one distribution site where two young men were running in the general rush to get aid. “You could just see two soldiers run after them. They drop on to their knees and they just take two shots, and you could just see … two heads snap backwards and just drop,” Sam says. He recounts another incident in which an IDF tank in the vicinity of one of the distribution sites destroys “a normal car … just four normal people sat inside it”.According to UN figures, at least 944 Palestinian civilians were killed while seeking aid in the vicinity of GHF aid sites. GHF and the IDF have denied targeting civilians seeking food at aid distribution sites, and the IDF has denied the allegations of systematic war crimes, insisting it operates in accordance with international law and takes measures to minimise civilian harm in its operations against Hamas. Internal investigations of incidents involving the killing of civilians have led to virtually no disciplinary or legal accountability.Breaking Ranks shows the mental strain on at least some of the soldiers in Gaza.“I feel like they’ve destroyed all my pride in being an Israeli – in being an IDF officer,” Daniel says in the programme. “All that’s left is shame.”Breaking Ranks: Inside Israel’s War will air in the UK at 10.45pm on Monday 10 November on ITV1, ITVX, STV and STV PlayerQuick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

He was expected to push for a full lifting of the remaining sanctions on his war-ravaged country.Sharaa, whose Islamist rebel forces toppled the longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad late last year, has courted the US president to try to reverse the economic restrictions imposed during the 13-year civil war, arguing they are no longer justified.His media adviser, Ahmad Zeidan, told Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya the “foremost” issue on Sharaa’s agenda was a repeal of the CaesarSyriaCivilian Protection Act of 2019 which imposed sweeping sanctions over human rights abuses by Assad’s regime during the conflict.Trump met the Syrian leader for the first time last May in Riyadh on the sidelines of a Gulf Cooperation Council summit. Before the talks, he praised Sharaa to reporters as a “young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter”.Trump then ordered most sanctions lifted in a big US policy shift. But the Caesar Act remains in place and will require a congressional vote to remove its particularly stringent sanctions permanently.Sharaa, who as a militant leader had a $10m (£7.6m) US government bounty on his head, is the former leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the rebel group that ledthe military operationto topple Assad.On Thursday, Washington led a vote by the UN security council to quash UN sanctions against him. In September the ex-jihadist, who had been previously affiliated with al-Qaida, became the first Syrian president in decades to address the UN general assembly in New York.“We have a big mission to build the economy,” Sharaa said at a summit on the sidelines of that gathering. “Syria has a diverse workforce. They love to work, it’s in its genes. So don’t be worried, just lift the sanctions and you will see the results.”In October, the World Bank put a “conservative best estimate” of the cost of rebuilding Syria at $216bn (£164bn).The US state department on Friday removed Sharaa from a terrorism blacklist, a move that had been widely predicted, and the president is expected to officially join the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group during his visit to Washington.Syria this month carried out nationwide preemptive operations targeting IS cells. The interior ministry said Syrian security forcescarried out 61 raids, with 71 people arrestedand explosives and weapons seized.Amid warming relations, the state department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sharaa’s government had been meeting US demands including on working to find missing Americans and on eliminating any remaining chemical weapons.“These actions are being taken in recognition of the progress demonstrated by the Syrian leadership after the departure of Bashar al-Assad and more than 50 years of repression under the Assad regime,” Pigott said.He added the axing of the punitive measures would promote “regional security and stability as well as an inclusive, Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process”.Sharaa and his team have been at pains to present themselves as moderates ready to usher in a new era of peace and prosperity for the battle-scarred country after 13 years of civil war, and work constructively with regional powers.However the Israeli government is said to oppose a full lifting of US sanctions, arguing it would cede key leverage in Washington’s dealings with Damascus.WhileIsrael and Syria remain formally in a state of war, with Israel still occupying Syria’s Golan Heights, Trump has expressed hope that the two countries can normalise relations.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricaDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The registered owner of the car has reportedly been detained for questioning.The fire service said the blast injured 19 people, who were being treated at a government hospital. Large train stations across India, the financial capital Mumbai, and the state of Uttar Pradesh, which borders Delhi, were all put on high alert, authorities said.Police said a slow-moving car had stopped at a red light just outside the Red Fort metro station before the blast. “An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to the explosion, nearby vehicles were also damaged,” said the Delhi police commissioner, Satish Golcha.Dozens of fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene after the blast. Footage on Indian TV news channels showed the chaos of the aftermath, including a car with its doors blasted off, mangled bodies and people screaming in panic. More than a dozen other cars, rickshaws and motorcycles were blackened and burned in the fire caused by the explosion.Om Prakash Gupta, a witness who lives close to the scene, said he was at home when he heard a loud explosion. “I rushed out with my children and saw several vehicles on fire, body parts all over,” he told The Associated Press. He said he saw one body on the windscreen of a car.A cab driver, who gave his name as just Shahrukh, said he heard a loud explosion. “I came out of the car and started running along with others on the road,” he said.Another witness told NDTV the force of the blast had sent shock waves through nearby buildings. “One person’s body was torn into pieces. I saw a hand on the road,” he said. “It was a very strong explosion.”Golcha confirmed at least eight people had been killed and 20 injured. “The situation is being monitored. We are investigating the incident and will update you shortly,” he added.India’s home affairs minister, Amit Shah, said it was “difficult to say what caused the incident until the samples recovered from the blast site are analysed”.As he travelled to the explosion site, Shah added: “We do not consider any angle closed. We will investigate all angles with determination.”In a post on X, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he was reviewing the situation with Shah. “Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi earlier this evening. May the injured recover at the earliest. Those affected are being assisted by authorities,” he said.The Red Fort, known as Lal Qila, is located in the heavily congested Old Delhi area of India’s capital which is usually heaving with people, food stalls and vehicles and is a popular tourist destination.A vast 17th-century Mughal palace, the fort is one of India’s most significant monuments. The prime minister makes an annual address on the fort’s ramparts on Independence Day and it features on the country’s banknotes.Delhi was the target of blasts during the 1980s and 1990s, with public places such as bus stations and crowded market areas hit in attacks blamed on Islamist militants or on separatists from the northern Sikh state of Punjab.About a dozen people were killed in a briefcase explosion outside the Delhi high court in 2011 – the last such major incident in the city.Security in the national capital is the responsibility of the federal home ministry. Delhi police report directly to it, though the capital territory also has its own local government.Explore more on these topicsIndiaDelhiSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Their financials, their physical scale, and the amount of information contained within are so massive that the idea of stopping their construction can seem like opposing an avalanche in progress.Despite the scale and momentum of the explosion of data centers, resistance is mountingin the United States,in the United Kingdom, and in Latin America, where data centers have been built in some of the world’s driest areas. Local opposition in all three regions has often focused on the environmental impacts and resource consumption of the gargantuan structures.Paz Peña is a researcher and fellow with the Mozilla Foundation who studies the social and environmental impact of technology, particularly data centers and particularly in Latin America. She spoke to the Guardian at the Mozilla festival in Barcelona about how communities in Latin America are going to court to pry information away from governments and corporations that would much rather keep it secret.The Guardian: Could you describe your research?Paz Peña: Basically, my research is about the positions of governments on data centers and what the promises are behind them. What are the relationships that governments today in Latin America have with big tech? There’s a lot of lobbying activities around infrastructure and data centers from big tech to governments in Latin America.Chile and Brazil are the two top countries working on data centers today in Latin America, and Chile is one of the countries in Latin America that has a lot of resistance against data centers.What the governments are doing – I’m talking about leftwing governments … what they are looking for is foreign investment for data centers in their countries. The amounts are great. It’s a public policy to attract [data centers] with what they call national investment plans. They’re doing tax exemptions, for example, in Brazil, which is a huge controversy back there.In the case of Chile, what they’re doing is actually trying to deregulate the environmental assessments that data centers are going through.Carving out an exception for them?Peña: Exactly. There’s no specific category of environmental impact assessment for data centers in Latin America. In the case of Chile right now, they are assessed on the diesel that they use, because they use diesel generators for energy. It’s huge amounts of diesel.The government actually made an administrative change in the environmental system evaluation, where the threshold that data centers need to achieve on diesel to pass an environmental assessment changed. Magically, that means that data centers are not going through environmental impact assessments in Chile any more, which was the reason why communities understood what were the impacts of data centers. They don’t have that information right now.What we’re seeing is that governments are creating opportunities for investments but not creating rules and regulations for the environmental impacts of data centers, rules about diesel use, energy, and water.Without that information on data centers, do you see that the opposition to them is confused orhobbled because they don’t know what it is they’re opposing? Or does it incite more opposition because of the feeling of not being told what’s really going on?In the case of Chile, I would say that the local activism is quite angry with the leftwing government. The promises of this government was to be an environmental, sustainable exercise of power, right? President [Gabriel] Boric actually said this, that he would form anecological government. Nobody really believes that. But they put that in the discourse. So you have to pay your words, right?People are really mad. I would say for two reasons. One is that they don’t have the transparency to understand what is going on in their neighborhoods. The second thing is they are super mad about it because the national data center plan, which is, again, a foreign investment plan, is presented for companies – but not necessarily for communities. When they actually publicly presented this plan, which was about two months ago, all the industry was present, but super few people from communities. Communities felt like they were being left out of the conversation.If there’s a data center planned for my neighborhood and I oppose it, what should I do?In a community, you will find people that understand what a data center is and some people will not have an idea of what it is. So when they have heard, they probably heard by two sources: a government’s evaluation system or the media. So once they have heard about this, the main problem they have is, again, transparency. Because corporate secrecy is still super present around the resources that these data centers need – energy, water, et cetera.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When a community asks for more information, the government is saying: it’s corporate secrecy. We cannot give you that information. So in general, what we are seeing is that communities are considering going to court to actually ask for that information. Because in Latin America, there is an inter-American agreement called the Escazu agreement, which is an environmental agreement about transparency, saying that a government cannot hide this incredibly important information for people.In the case of Uruguay, they went to court, because there was a Google data center being built in Uruguay in Montevideo, the capital. A couple of years ago, they’re going through an incredible drought where the people in Montevideo had to shower with buckets of water.Meanwhile, the government announced that this Google data center, where the amounts of water needed would be immense. So people were asking if this water, this very scarce resource, should be going to Google or to people. This is a fair question.They didn’t know exactly how much water Google would need. So they asked the government. The government said no. The environmental minister said: no, you cannot have that information because it’s corporate secrecy by Google. So they went to court, and they won, actually. The court quoted the Eskasu agreement.When a community takes a public stance saying we want more information about this and that, and social and environmental impacts, the impression is that they are opposing progress, technological progress, economic progress. Corporations, and I will say, sadly, governments – they see communities as a kind of roadblock.The first thing people need is information, and the first hurdle that they confront is the lack of information. So I would say that the first step they need to take is to find any source of information, and sometimes go to court. The majority of these actions are not successful, but they are sometimes the only way that corporations but also, sadly, governments give the information to the people.If you lose the fight, what should you do then if you’re a member of this community?For some communities in Chile that I interviewed, big tech companies weren’t actually the enemy, which is very interesting. Data center plans were seen as sort of an opportunity to raise the bar of environmental measures, because the people in those communities are surrounded by so many bad corporate actors who pollute a lot and don’t even care. It’s not necessarily a movement against big tech. Not yet, I would say. Maybe later.For now, these communities see a tech company planning a data center as not as a bad actor, actually as a strategic opportunity to raise the bar of environmental care and measures in their own neighborhoods. Big tech companies have this necessity of being the good player in the world, or at least being seen that way, so there is an opportunity for people to say, ‘Big tech has raised the bar of environmental care. So let’s try to put some sort of pressure to the other bad actors.’The enormous amounts of money and the physical scale of these things are so huge. They seem to operate on this inhumanly large level. How do people believe in their own opposition to these projects? They’re so massive that it kind of seems like you’re just saying no to an earthquake.In general, people who are working against data centers are people who have a background working on environmental issues. It’s people really used to the big fight. It’s people that really understand how difficult it is to deal with corporations and with governments.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingSilicon ValleynewsShareReuse this content"

Rode hard and put away wet,” Rick Wilson, the ex-Republican strategist and co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, wrote in a piece titled “Schumer and the Hateful Eight Betray America”.“It was a colossal leadership failure, and Chuck Schumer should resign as minority leader immediately if he had a shred of honor or shame.”The sentiment is rife in progressive groups such as Our Revolution, whose executive director Joseph Geevarghese said: “Chuck Schumer should step down as Senate minority leader immediately. If he secretly backed this surrender and voted no to save face, he’s a liar. If he couldn’t keep his caucus in line, he’s inept. Either way, he’s proven incapable of leading the fight to prevent healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for millions of Americans.”In the House, three Democrats have so far called on Schumer to step aside, among them Mike Levin, who represents a swingy district on the southern California coast. “Chuck Schumer has not met this moment and Senate Democrats would be wise to move on from his leadership,” he wrote on X Monday.Fellow Californian Ro Khanna said, “Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” while Michigan representative andSquadmember Rashida Tlaib said the minority leader “has failed to meet this moment and is out of touch with the American people. The Democratic party needs leaders who fight and deliver for working people. Schumer should step down.”But none of the voices calling for a change in leadership belong to the Democratic senators who could force the issue. Nor did Hakeem Jeffries, who leads the party in the House of Representatives, join in. “Yes and yes,” he said at a Monday press conference, when a reporter asked if he believed Schumer was effective, and whether he should keep the leadership post he has held for eight years.A spokesman for Schumer did not respond to a request for comment.The squabble is in many ways a rehash of one that took place earlier this year, when the 74-year-old briefly found himself manning the barricades in a funding battle the ended up turning into a Democratic rout.The moment came three months into Donald Trump’s presidency and days before government funding was set to expire. House Republicans had sent the Senate a short-term funding measure that almost all Democrats in the lower chamber opposed.Faced with the prospect of swallowing the bill as is, or demanding changes and likely causing a shutdown, Schumerinitially went with the latter, beforechanging his mindand voting for the measure along with his caucus’s centrists. The decision broughta backlashfrom the party’s base, with liberal groups such as Indivisible and MoveOn calling for new leadership.Schumer survived, and when the latest funding battle began 41 days ago, his office collaborated with those same groups on their shutdown strategy. The Democrats held firm for weeks, even as an increasingly frustrated John Thune, the Republican Senate majority leader, held 14 fruitless votes on GOP-authored legislation to reopen the government, without addressing the ACA subsidies.Over in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson put representatives on a lengthy recess to make clear to Senate Democrats that his party was not interested in negotiating over their demands.At the press conferences he convened regularly after funding lapsed, Johnson repeatedly alleged that the “Schumer shutdown” was driven by the minority leader’s desire not to face a primary challenge in 2028 from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York congresswoman who Republicans allege is shaping the party’s agenda.“He thinks AOC is going to challenge him or some other Marxist,” Johnson said in early October.The compromise to reopen the government authorizes funding through January, and promises Democrats a vote on extending the ACA tax credits, though there is no guarantee their bill would pass the Senate, or, if it does, come up for a vote in the House. Schumer’s fingerprints are not publicly on the deal, which was worked out by a group of moderate senators who have either recently won re-election or are in their final terms in office.“This healthcare crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [resolution] that fails to address the healthcare crisis,” he said after the deal was announced. He did not vote to advance the bill when it cleared an important procedural vote on Sunday night.By Monday afternoon, signs emerged that some Democrats did not like the tone of the debate over the bill. “As a reminder, the DCCC is currently targeting dozens of Republican-held districts across the country,” Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, wrote in a memo to House lawmakers.“We would like to encourage all of you to hold vulnerable Republicans in your state, region, and media market accountable when you’re doing earned and social media this week.” Translation: lay off Schumer.Whether the party’s base listens is another question.“Despite his no vote, the entire political world knows this is a direct result of Chuck Schumer’s leadership,”wroteIndivisible, as it encouraged the progressive group’s supporters to call Democratic senators and tell them to find a new leader.“He either blessed this surrender, or was incapable of leading his caucus to hold the line.”Explore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025Chuck SchumerDemocratsTrump administrationUS SenateUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said his detention appeared to be in retaliation for the Muslim political commentator’s criticism of Israel while touring the US, calling it a “blatant affront to free speech”, and called for his release.Later on 26 October, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin,saidthat Hamdi’s visa had been revoked and that he was in “ICE custody pending removal”.“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country,” McLaughlin said.In a separate statement that same day, the state departmentsaidthat the US “has no obligation to host foreigners who support terrorism and actively undermine the safety of Americans. We continue to revoke the visas of persons engaged in such activity”.The Guardian reported last month that the US officials appeared to be referencing remarks Hamdi made following the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, as on 27 October, the DHSshared a video clipby the pro-Israel group Memri, in which Hamdi was recorded saying that Palestinians should “celebrate their victory” and asked if they had felt “euphoria” over what had taken place.Hamdilater soughtto clarify his remarks. In anotherspeaking engagementseveral days after the Hamas attacks he said: “We don’t celebrate blood lust, we don’t celebrate death and we don’t celebrate war” adding that “what Muslims are celebrating is not war, they’re celebrating the revival of a cause – a just cause – that everybody thought was dead, this is an important distinction … I don’t celebrate war, I don’t celebrate death.”In aninterview with the Guardianin late October, Hamdi’s wife called the allegations against her husband “outrageous” and said the videos were “edited in a way to frame Sami in a horrible light and produced by an organization that is very well known to be anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, Islamophobic and out there to target people who are speaking up against the genocide against Palestinians”.On Monday, the California chapter of Cair, whose legal team has been representing Hamdi in court along with attorneys from the Muslim Legal Fund of America and The HMA Law Firm,confirmed in a statementthat Hamdi had accepted an offer to leave the US voluntarily.They added that the immigration charging document filed “in his case alleged only a visa overstay – after the government revoked his visa without cause and without prior notice – and never identified any criminal conduct or security grounds”.“This agreement establishes that the government does not consider Hamdi a danger to the community or to national security,” Cair said.However, McLaughlin of DHS said in a statement: “Sami Hamdi, an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer who cheered on Hamas following its October 7 terrorist attack, requested voluntary departure and ICE is happily arranging his removal from this country.“Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC has confirmed it had received a letter and said it will respond in due course.Theresignationsof the BBC director general, Tim Davie, and its News CEO, Deborah Turness, came after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published aleaked internal reportby a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster’s coverage. The report criticised BBC coverage on transgender issues, Gaza and an edit of a Trump speech from January 6 during the Capitol Hill insurrection.Why the BBC is apologising over a Trump documentary – and what happens nextRead more“Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.’ These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!,” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social.After Davie resigned, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, also celebrated byposting on Xher Saturday interview with the Telegraph, which she captioned with “shot” and the BBC article announcing Davie’s resignation, captioned with “chaser”.On Saturday Leavitt had described the BBC to Telegraph as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”, saying that watchingBBCbulletins while on trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that taxpayers were being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine”.The independent and publicly funded BBC has been under mounting pressure for years. Rightwing critics accuse it of a liberal bias, while leftwing critics express frustration that its management was unduly influenced by previous Conservative governments and that it has allowed itself to be drawn into “culture wars” over issues like race, sex and gender.A tense and unpredictable atmosphere has left BBC journalists feeling exposed when reporting on contentious issues, particularly the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.At home and abroad, Trump has maintained a persistently antagonistic relationship with many major news organisations, frequently labelling outlets as “the enemy of the people”. This strategy has included suing news organisations, revoking press credentials for reporters, and exerting pressure on media companies and platforms.BBC chair apologises for Trump speech edit but defends corporation against bias claimsRead moreThe New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has stated that “press freedom is no longer a given in the United States”, arguing that the Trump administration’s policies could cause irreparable harm and will probably take decades to repair.The leaked BBC report said the current affairs Panorama documentary had “completely misled” viewers by splicing two parts of Trump’s speech together. The Panorama edit cut together quotes from sections of the speech delivered up to an hour apart, combining a line about walking to the Capitol with the instruction to “fight like hell”.The BBC chair, Samir Shah, later on Monday apologised for the editing of the Trump speech, calling it an “error of judgment”.Trump in fact gave conflicting advice that day to supporters, who he had called on to gather in the capital as part of his efforts to discredit his election loss based on false claims of widespread fraud. The US president was later impeached for “incitement of insurrection” related to the storming of the Capitol by rioters, but hewas acquittedby the Senate after Republicans rallied around him.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpBBCUS politicsLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Ukrainian mediaidentified one of them as Timur Mindich, a businessman and associate of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.Mindichreportedly fled abroadhours before investigators arrived at his Kyiv apartment to carry out a search. He is the co-owner of Kvartal 95, the media production company Zelenskyy founded before he became president.The two were friends and business partners in the years before Zelenskyy went into politics. According to one source, there has been much less communication since Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly four years ago.In a statement the national anti-corruption bureau (Nabu) said several individuals had formed a criminal gang and built “a large-scale corruption scheme to influence strategic enterprises in the public sector, in particular Energoatom”. It forced Energoatom’s counterparties to pay kickbacks of 10-15% in order to avoid having payments for services or goods blocked, or losing their supplier status, the bureau alleged.Asked about Mindich, a senior official in Zelenskyy’s office said Ukraine’s government supported “all activities that stamped out corruption”. They said evidence collected by Nabu and other independent bodies should be tested in court.The case highlights long-running tensions between the presidential administration and Ukraine’s two leading anti-corruption agencies. In July Zelenskyyapproved a contentious billthat weakened the powers of Nabu and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office.The move triggered the first serious protests against his government. Several thousand demonstratorsgathered outside the president’s office in Kyiv. They waved banners and shouted slogans including “Shame” and “Veto the law”, after Ukraine’s parliament approved the measure.Zelenskyy climbed down in the face of popular opposition and after fielding calls from European allies who raised concerns. New legislation was hastily passed to restore the agencies’ powers and it appeared to guarantee their independence.Eradicating graft and shoring up the rule of law are key requirements forKyivto join the EU, which Ukrainians see as critical to their future as Russia’s war continues to rage.Ukraine’s power system has been significantly damaged by a campaign of Kremlin bombardment this autumn, causing huge power cuts for people across the country. Russia has not hit nuclear plants but has damaged substations connected to them.In an interview with the Guardianpublished on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Vladimir Putin was carrying out deliberate “terrorist acts” against civilians, leaving them without power and water. During the conversation in the presidential palace in Kyiv, the lights went off twice.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUkraineKyivEnergy industryEuropeVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

How can a loss-making startup such asOpenAIafford such a staggering spending commitment?Answer that positively and it will go a long way to easing investor concerns over bubble warnings in the artificial intelligence boom, from lofty tech company valuations to a mooted$3tn global spend on datacentres.The company behind ChatGPT needs a vast amount of computing power – or compute, in tech jargon – to train its models, produce their responses and build even more powerful systems in the future. The cost of its compute commitment – the AI infrastructure such as chips and servers that power its world famous chatbot – is $1.4tn over the next eight years, a figure that dwarfs its $13bn in annual revenues.Boom or bubble? Inside the $3tn AI datacentre spending spreeRead moreOver the past week this gap has appeared chasm-like, becoming a backdrop tomarket nerves over AI spendingand statements by OpenAI executives that did little to answer concerns.Sam Altman, the OpenAI chief executive, first attempted to deal with it in an awkward exchange with a leading investor in the company, Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital, that ended with Altman ordering: “enough”.Speaking on his podcastwith Altman last month, Gerstner described the company’s ability to pay for more than $1tn in compute costs, while revenue is running at $13bn a year, as a question “hanging over the market”.Altman responded: “First of all, we’re doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad if you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer. I just, enough.”Then last week the OpenAI chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, suggested that the US government could underwrite some of the chip spending.“This is where we’re looking for an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental, the ways governments can come to bear,” she told the Wall Street Journal, adding that such a guarantee “can really drop the cost of financing”.Was OpenAI, which recently announced it is becoming a fully fledgedfor-profit companyworth $500bn, really saying that AI companies should be treated like banks in the late 2000s? This triggered immediate attempts at clarification from Friar, who took to LinkedIn to deny that OpenAI was seeking a federal backstop, while Altman sought to set the record straight on X.In a long post, Altman wrote “we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters”, adding that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make “bad business decisions”. Instead, perhaps, the government should build its own AI infrastructure and give loan guarantees to support chip manufacturing in the US.Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, says OpenAI is trying to match the other big AI players such as Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Google and Microsoft – itself a leading backer of OpenAI – which are supported by their already hugely profitable business models.“OpenAI wants to match or exceed the infrastructure – the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of compute – of the big platform companies. But those companies have cashflows from their existing businesses to pay for this and OpenAI does not, so it’s trying to bootstrap its way into the club,” he says.View image in fullscreenAltman believes that $1.4tn can be paid off by future demand for OpenAI products and by ever-improving models.Photograph: Stephen Brashear/APThere are also questions over the circular nature of some of OpenAI’s compute deals. For instance, Oracle will spend $300bn building new datacentres for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin – and OpenAI will then pay back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres.Under the terms of a transaction with Nvidia, the leading maker of the chips that AI companies use, OpenAI will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.Altman also addressed the revenue issue, writing that OpenAI expects to end the year above $20bn in annualised revenue and then grow to “hundreds of billion[s]” by 2030.He added: “Based on the trends we are seeing of how people are using AI and how much of it they would like to use, we believe the risk of OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It makes its revenues from ChatGPT subscriptions for consumers –which account for 75% of its income– and offering businesses its corporate versions of ChatGPT, while also allowing companies and start ups to build their own products with its AI models.One Silicon Valley investor, who does not have a financial interest in OpenAI, says OpenAI can build on its popularity but its success is contingent on factors such as the models improving, the cost of operating them getting cheaper and the chips used to power them becoming less costly.“The belief is that OpenAI can leverage its strong brand and ChatGPT’s position as a popular choice among consumers and businesses to build a suite of high value and high margin products. The question is at what scale can they build out these products and revenue models and how good can these models get,” says the investor.But it is loss-making. OpenAI says reporting of its losses, including reports that it lost $8bn in the first half of the year and about $12bn in the third quarter, are inaccurate, although it does not deny it loses money or provide alternative figures.Altman believes the revenue will come from a number of sources. For instance: growing demand for paid-for versions of ChatGPT; other companies using its datacentres; people buying thehardware devices it is buildingwith iPhone designer Sir Jony Ive; and that “huge value” will be created by AI’s achievements in scientific research.So that is the bet: OpenAI needs $1.4tn worth of compute, a number dwarfing its current revenues, because it believes demand and ever better iterations of its products will pay it off.Carl Benedikt Frey, author of How Progress Ends and the associate professor of AI and work at Oxford University, is sceptical about OpenAI’s hopes and points to recentevidence of a slowdownin AI adoption in the world’s largest economy. The US Census Bureau, for instance,reportedthat AI adoption has been declining in recent months among companies with more than 250 employees.“On various measures AI adoption has been falling in the US since the summer. We do not know exactly why, but it does suggest that we are at a stage where some users and businesses feel they are not quite getting what they hoped for from AI so far,” says Frey, adding that without “new breakthroughs” at the company he does not see it reaching $100bn in revenue by 2027 – a figure Altman hashinted at.OpenAI says it is seeing accelerating business adoption, with the corporate version of ChatGPT growing nine times year over year as it gains customers from an array of sectors including banking, life sciences and manufacturing.Altman acknowledged on X, nonetheless, that the bet might not pay off.“But of course we could be wrong, and the market – not the government – will deal with it if we are.”Explore more on these topicsOpenAITechnology sectorSam AltmanArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He must also avoid contact with anyone who could be viewed as a victim, witness or co-defendant in the case.Ortiz, dressed in a pale green track suit, did not say anything in court. His lawyers declined to speak to reporters afterward.US sports betting crisis grows as MLB’s Clase and Ortiz indicted over alleged rigged pitchesRead moreShortly after the hearing, Major League Baseball announced new limits on betting on individual pitches, saying its authorized gaming operators will cap wagers on them at $200 and exclude them from parlays.According to the indictment against Ortiz and Clase, they took several thousand dollars in payoffs to help two unnamed gamblers in their home country, the Dominican Republic, win at least $460,000 on bets placed on the speed and outcome of certain pitches.Clase, a three-time All-Star closer, and Ortiz, a starting pitcher, have been on non-disciplinary paid leave since July, whenMLBstarted investigating what it said was unusually high in-game betting activity when the two pitched.Ortiz, 26, was arrested Sunday by the FBI at Boston Logan International Airport. Clase, 27, is believed to be outside the US, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter.Ortiz and Clase “betrayed America’s pastime,” US attorney Joseph Nocella Jr said on Sunday. “Integrity, honesty and fair play are part of the DNA of professional sports. When corruption infiltrates the sport, it brings disgrace not only to the participants but damages the public trust in an institution that is vital and dear to all of us.”Ortiz’s lawyer, Chris Georgalis, said in a statement Sunday that his client is innocent and “has never, and would never, improperly influence a game – not for anyone and not for anything.”Georgalis said Ortiz’s defense team previously told prosecutors that the payments and money transfers between him and individuals in the Dominican Republic were for legal activities.MLB said it contacted federal law enforcement when it began investigating unusual betting activity and has fully cooperated with authorities. “We are aware of the indictment and today’s arrest, and our investigation is ongoing,” the league said in a statement.In a statement, the Guardians said: “We are aware of the recent law enforcement action. We will continue to fully cooperate with both law enforcement and Major League Baseball as their investigations continue.”Clase and Ortiz are each charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery. The top charges carry a potential punishment of up to 20 years in prison.In one example cited in the indictment, Clase allegedly invited a bettor to a game against the Boston Red Sox in April and spoke with him by phone just before taking the mound. Four minutes later, the indictment said, the bettor and his associates won $11,000 on a wager that Clase would toss a certain pitch slower than 97.95 mph.Clase, a two-time American League Reliever of the Year, had a $4.5m salary in 2025, the fourth season of a $20 million, five-year contract. He began providing the bettors with information about his pitches in 2023 but didn’t ask for payoffs until this year, prosecutors said.Prosecutors said Ortiz, who had a $782,600 salary this year, got in on the scheme in June and is accused of rigging pitches in games against the Seattle Mariners and the St Louis Cardinals.The charges are the latest developments in a federal crackdown on betting in professional sports.Last month, more than 30 people, including prominent basketball figures such as Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier,were arrested in a gamblingsweep that rocked the NBA.Explore more on these topicsMLBCleveland GuardiansGamblingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But this season the NFC only has a few contenders while even the best teams in the AFC have worrying flawsOliver ConnollyMon 10 Nov 2025 07.41 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 12.57 ESTShareNo league sells parity like the NFL: it’s the entire brand. But through 10 weeks of this season, this isn’t a league that is equally balanced between the good, the bad and the mediocre. It’s one where most of the league is simplyfine.In the NFC, at least, there is some clarity. The Rams and Seahawks (both 7-2) look like the most complete teams in football, and secured blowout wins on Sunday. The 6-2 Eagles, despite their struggles, still have one of the most talented rosters in the league, likewise with the Packers (5-2-1). Even the Lions (6-3), who have been inconsistent along both lines of scrimmage and have been dealing with tension on their coaching staff, have proven they can hammer good teams. For all five, you can still easily put together a Super Bowl path.Over in the AFC, though, the playoff picture is a jumbled mess. Your four division leaders through ten weeks: the Colts, Patriots, Broncos (all at 8-2) and Steelers (5-4). Read that again. Not the Chiefs. Not the Bills. Not the Ravens or Bengals. The traditional powers, backed by the league’s best quarterbacks, have either glaring roster weaknesses or have been hit by injuries.In some ways, it’s the league’s ideal; the parity mechanics are working as intended. But watching this year’s four division leaders in the AFC still feels strange. Areas of each team pass the championship smell test, but not in their entirety. If you were asked to lock in your AFC Championship game picks today, would you confidently pick any of the four division leaders?Starting in Indianapolis, Daniel Jones hasn’t quite reached pumpkin status. But the last two weeks have been worrying. He’s back to turning over the ball and struggling against pressure. He took seven sacks against the Falcons on Sunday, and had a five-minute stretch in which he threw an interception and fumbled three times. This is a week after he turned the ball over five times against the Steelers.NFL roundup: Dolphins shock Bills as Texans stage record comeback against JagsRead moreThe Colts’ offense thrived early in the season because Jones avoided the disaster plays. Jonathan Taylor and the offensive line mean the Colts are good enough to survive some negative plays, as they did in Berlin. But Jones returning to his old blunder-prone days would end any playoff run.The Patriots feel somewhat similar. A year ago, they were a punchline. Now, they’re the league’s happiest surprise and the hottest team in football after seven straight wins. If not for fumbling away a winnable game against Pittsburgh, they’d be sitting at 9–1 with the best record in the league. Last season, they were old and slow. Now they’re young, fast and unafraid. Still, it’s hard to ignore how soft the Patriots’ schedule has been. They have faced the easiest slate in the league, and there have still been cracks. Drake Maye has been sacked 35 times – the second-most in football – and some of the shots he absorbed on Sunday were vicious. Over time, those beatings accumulate.The Broncos are 8–2 as well, and it still feels as if they’re holding their breath. Bo Nix has been erratic, and the offense plodding, with the defense doing all the heavy lifting. Without serviceable quarterback play, the Broncos aren’t scaring anyone in the postseason. The Chargers are also hovering in the AFC West at 7-2, but the injuries along their offensive line will make it tough to mount a deep postseason tilt.And then there’s Pittsburgh, somehow still leading the AFC North despite being thumped 25-10 by the Chargers on Sunday night. They have a negative point differential, their defense too often disappears and Aaron Rodgers’ limitations at this stage of his career continue to show up. They’re 5–4 and holding on, but Baltimore, with Lamar Jackson healthy again and the schedule softening, are on a three-game win streak. It shouldn’t be too much of a surprise that the Ravens have pulled within a game of the Steelers, but that it has arrived so quickly is an indictment of Pittsburgh’s inconsistencies. That the Ravens started the season 1-5 and still look like they shouldwin the division is telling about the conference as a whole.The Ravens' form part of the Big Three – alongside the Bills and Chiefs – powered by their MVP quarterbacks, who would still strike the most fear in opposing teams if they made the playoffs. They’re the No One Wants To See ‘Em teams, but the Chiefs and Bills cannot get out of their own way.A week ago, the Bills were riding high after beating the Chiefs. On Sunday they suffered one of the most disappointing losses of the season. They didn’t just lose to the Dolphins; they were embarrassed, falling 30-13 on the road. It was Miami’s first win against Buffalo in more than 1,000 days.If you’re looking for a microcosm of the day, here you go: Josh Allen turning a quarterback sneak into a 15-yard run,before fumbling the ball away.The Bills were blanked in the first half, coughing up costly turnovers. Receivers struggle to separate early, forcing Allen to hold on to the ball and chase a boom-or-bust approach that robs the offense of its typical tempo. On defense, there are even bigger concerns. They don’t have enough pass-rush juice to trouble most offenses consistently, their run defense has been a sieve all year and now their secondary is banged up.The Chiefs, at 5–4, feel the same. Theadvanced metricscontinue to paint them as a championship contender, thanks largely to Patrick Mahomes and the fact that each loss has been close. It’s almost the inverse of last year, when they started 9-0 but struggled through long portions of that run. And, on offense at least, the metrics are backed up by the eye test. But their pass-rush runs hot and cold and the offense is too overly reliant on Mahomes’ magic just to stick on schedule.Add it all up, and the AFC is filled with teams simultaneously dangerous and flawed. The perennial contenders are still scratching around for some consistency. If the Patriots keep humming and the Chiefs cannot catch the Broncos, it will be the first time in the Allen-Mahomes era that the duo enter the postseason in the Wildcard Round. The NFC has recent history with wildcard teams winning it all, but the last AFC side to do so was the 2005 Steelers.Maybe the Bills, Chiefs and Ravens all coalesce down the stretch. But it’s setting up to be a different kind of postseason in the AFC. The Patriots are the most well-rounded group at the moment, but it’s a long way to go from laughing stock to legitimate contender in 12 months.View image in fullscreenJonathan Taylor will leave Germany with fond memories of Berlin.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APMVP of the weekJonathan Taylor, RB, Colts.Grab your placard. The campaign for a non-quarterback to win MVP chugs on. Taylor was back to his best on Sunday after a below-par performance in Pittsburgh last week. He rushed for a career-high 244 yards and scored three touchdowns, including a walk-off score, as the Colts beat the Falcons 31-25 in overtime in Berlin. After jumping out to an early first-quarter lead, the Colts’ offense spent two quarters stalling. Jones was shaky under relentless pressure from Atlanta’s front. So Shane Steichen did what good coaches do: he repeatedly put the ball in the hands of his best player. Taylor more than held up his end of the bargain, rushing for 228 yards aftercontact and forcing 11 missed tackles. It’s hard for a running back to be more valuable than that.Video of the weekNow for the latest installment of Stuff We Don’t Normally See: Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson checked with his coaching staffmid-playabout whether it was OK for him to score a late touchdown..@TreVeyonH4IS STILL RUNNING📺 CBSpic.twitter.com/0PrhqW5xrQ— New England Patriots (@Patriots)November 9, 2025With the Patriots leading by five with under two minutes to play, they set up to run the ball and drain the clock. Henderson gathered a toss from Maye, shook off a would-be tackler and broke into open space along the Bucs’ sideline. As he pulled away from a gaggle of defenders, Henderson slowed down, swerved towards the middle of the field and turned to Mike Vrabel on the opposite side of the field to get permission to score. The coaching staff obliged, allowing Henderson to complete the 69-yard touchdown rather than downing the ball to run out the clock.It capped off the long-awaited Henderson breakout game. He ripped off two long touchdown runs against an excellent Tampa defense and finished with 147 yards on 14 carries in a 28-23 win.View image in fullscreenMatthew Stafford has the Los Angeles Rams flying.Photograph: Jed Jacobsohn/APStat of the week20. That’s how many touchdowns Matthew Stafford has thrown in the last six games – while giving up zero interceptions. He also has more touchdowns (25) this season than he did in the whole of his last campaign (21). The 37-year-old seems to be getting better as he approaches 40, keeping the amazing throws he has always been capable of, while cutting down on mistakes. “MVP!” Davante Adams shouted at Stafford as he was interviewed on Fox after Sunday’s 42-26 win over the 49ers. Stafford just smiled – at 7-2 the Rams look like a realistic Super Bowl contender.View image in fullscreenThe New York Jets have won two games in a row.Photograph: Brooks Von Arx/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockElsewhere around the league-- The New York Jets are undefeated in the post-Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams era!The Jets traded the two All-Pros last weekfor a parcel of future draft picks. On Sunday, they won their second game in a row – this one 27-20 against the Browns – mainly thanks to their special teams: they scored on punt and kickoff returns. There were questions about how motivated the Jets roster would be after the front office jettisoned two of their best players, but they fought impressively against the Browns’ strong defence – many inspired by the pre-game tributes to Nick Mangold, their longtime centerwho died in October at the age of 41. “Nick was with us today,” said safety Tony Adams. “We had a kick return and a punt return [for touchdowns]. Kind of crazy. That’s nobody but God and the man himself, Nick.”-- Davis Mills, who looked set for an uneventful if well-paid life on the Texans bench once CJ Stroud took over as starting quarterback in Houston, had his most notable day as a professional on Sunday. Starting because of Stroud’s concussion, Mills looked as if he was leading the Texans to a loss when they trailed 29-10 in the fourth-quarter. But the Texans reeled off 26 points – including a 14-yard touchdown run by Mills to give his team the lead – as they pulled off a 36-29 win to keep their playoff hopes just about alive.-- After reports emerged Donald Trump wants the Commandersto name their new stadium after him, the president attended the team’s 44-22 loss to the Lions on Sunday. After Trump wasbooed by large parts of the stadium, Fox gave him nearly 10 minutes of air time in the broadcast booth to talk about his high school football career and the NFL in general. Those bits were fairly inoffensive but Fox then decided to give him what was effectively free rein to boast about his achievements when Jonathan Vilma asked him about the state of the country. As Trump definitely didn’t stick to sports he touted the record stock market, investment in America and said he had brought down prices for Americans, a claim even his most diehard fanswould treat with suspicion.Explore more on these topicsNFLUS sportsBuffalo BillsIndianapolis ColtsKansas City ChiefsDenver BroncosNew England PatriotsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the second time this season the team had lost a game in which they were leading by at least 10 points with fewer than four minutes remaining.From floored to flawed: Does anyone want to win the Super Bowl this season?Read moreDaboll was asked about his job security after Sunday’s game and replied: “I’m just focused on these guys in the locker room.”Daboll, who had previously helped Josh Allen develop into one of the league’s best players at the Buffalo Bills, had an excellent start to his Giants career in the 2022 season. He was named theNFLcoach of the year after leading the team to an unexpected playoff berth before they lost to their fierce rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, in the divisional round.However, the team’s fortunes have declined since. They finished 6-11 in 2023, 3-14 in 2024 and will almost certainly miss the playoffs again this season. Daboll is known for his hot temper, and at times clashed with his coaching staff and his players. His job, alongside that of general manager Joe Schoen, was under question at the start of the season but Mara said he would keep them place as long as results improved.“I’m aware of how many games we’ve won, and obviously the results are not even close to what we want them to be,” Mara said before this season. “They’re going to have to get better if we’re going to move on.”The Giants said Schoen will remain in place. “We feel like Joe has assembled a good young nucleus of talent, and we look forward to its development,” Mara said on Monday. “Unfortunately, the results over the past three years have not been what any of us want. We take full responsibility for those results and look forward to the kind of success our fans expect.”Explore more on these topicsNew York GiantsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Amid all the talk aroundLiverpooland their disappointing form at the start of this season, that is perhaps the hardest question of all to answer. What were they trying to do? If it had worked, how would this team have played?The champions spent £424m (about $550m) on new signings in the summer, but if all had gone well, they would have spent an additional £40m ($53m) to land the Crystal Palace centre-back Marc Guéhi. The England international would, at the very least, have given an extra option at the back (the injury to Giovanni Leoni has diminished their defensive options further), allowing Arne Slot to rest Ibrahima Konaté, whose poor form continued in the 3-0 defeat to Manchester Cityon Sunday. An early City penalty was a direct result of Konaté getting in Conor Bradley’s way as Jérémy Doku cut in from the left.But Konaté’s partnership with Virgil van Dijk is proven. In past seasons, it has been far better than this. While neither central defender is playing well, Liverpool’s baffling openness this season has been less about individual form than structure – and that’s despite, in recent weeks, returning to last season’s midfield.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead moreAgainst Aston Villa last weekend, Slot selected an XI consisting of 10 players who were at the club last season, plus Hugo Ekitike. On Tuesday, against Real Madrid, there was one further change, with Florian Wirtz replacing Cody Gakpo. Liverpool won both of those games, but neither Villa nor Madrid tested their obvious vulnerability to direct balls played behind the full-backs. Going back to basics, trying to make the transition to something new and more incremental, may not quite have been an admission of hundreds of millions wasted in the summer, but it probably was an acknowledgment that there had been an attempt to change too much too quickly.Soccer teams are delicate organisms. Even on a purely tactical level, without considering the infinite complexities of psychology, changing one element of a lineup has an impact not merely on the other 10 elements, but on the coalitions between them. Take out Trent Alexander-Arnold, for instance, and Liverpool no longer have a player at right-back who naturally inverts to become an auxiliary holding midfielder alongside Ryan Gravenberch, shielding the centre of defense while liberating central midfielders Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai, while also being capable both of sweeping long passes to switch play and accurate quick balls forward to release Mohamed Salah.Slot had become convinced by the end of last season that opponents had worked Liverpool out, to an extent a consequence of the club’s limited transfer activity last summer. There was, anyway, always going to be a moment when this became discernibly his side rather than Jürgen Klopp’s. To that extent, significant change was inevitable and necessary. But what was the intention? If all had gone well, how should this side have looked?Liverpool signed two centre-forwards for a combined fee of £210m ($276m). Perhaps the plan was always to play only one of Alexander Isak and Ekitike, to keep them fresh, to have one always ready to come off the bench, much as West Brom once did with Romelu Lukaku and Shane Long. But given their cost, that’s an extraordinarily privileged position to be in, even if either could theoretically operate wide in extremis and so provide additional squad depth.Quick GuideNagelsmann blames Wirtz's slow start on Liverpool's formShowJulian Nagelsmann, the Germany head coach, has defended Florian Wirtz after criticism of his slow start to life at Liverpool, pinning some of the blame on the team's poor form and finishing.Wirtz, a £100m summer signing from Bayer Leverkusen, is yet to register a goal or assist in the Premier League – though he has created 16 chances – while Arne Slot's side have struggled to sustain their title defence. The attacking midfielder started as Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, a result which left them eighth in the table.Nagelsmann has called for patience with the Germany international, however. \"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo,\" he said. \"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\"If you look at the game against City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes. So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal. You see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"\"We all know what he's capable of and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form,\" Nagelsmann added. \"We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\"\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates. That would be one idea, because ... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"Wirtz is part of Nagelsmann's squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia. Victories in both matches will secure Germany's place at the 2026 World Cup finals.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But where was Wirtz, who cost £100m ($131m) plus add-ons, supposed to fit? He was seemingly promised he would play centrally, which helped persuade him to move from Bayer Leverkusen to Anfield rather than to Bayern. At the start of the season, Slot’s preference appeared to be for Wirtz as a central creator in a 4-2-3-1. But that, it turned out, left Liverpool hopelessly open at the back – something apparent even as they won their first five games of the season.Wirtz may adapt but, for now, he is struggling with the physicality of thePremier League. It’s very hard to see how he and Salah, for whose lack of natural defensive capacity Liverpool have always had to compensate, can play in the same side without risking the midfield being overwhelmed – at least not in the Premier League; Madrid simply did not provide the same physical challenge.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even if the summer were part of the transition to a post-Salah future, it’s very hard to understand what the plan was, unless Liverpool always had in mind some sort of 4-3-1-2, with Wirtz to play behind Alexander Isak and Ekitike, with width provided from full-back, which would at least help to explain why they signed Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong. In a world of direct play and long throws, perhaps a front two is the next part of English soccer’s 1980s revival.But for now, Liverpool stand as a cautionary tale of how you can take a very good team, throw money at it, and make everything much worse.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

The flip between the dream of driving for this amazing team and then the nightmare of the results that we’ve had.”Elkann, who was instrumental in persuading Hamilton to join Ferrari and with whom the British driver is friends, gave an equally forthright response, speaking in Milan. “They should focus on driving and talk less,” he said of his two drivers. “We still have a few races left, and it’s not impossible to finish second.” Hamilton is sixth in the drivers’ championship, 66 points behind his teammateCharles Leclercand still without a podium finish. Leclerc was also knocked out of the race at Interlagos through no fault of his own when Kimi Antonelli crashed into him, dropping the Scuderia from second to fourth in the constructors’ championship.Hamilton had to retire after he took floor damage in a misjudged attempt to pass the Alpine of Franco Colapinto, for which he was later given a five-second penalty. Elkann intimated he expected better.“InFormula One, on the one hand, we have the mechanics who did their job, including poles and pit stops,” he said. “The engineers did the same, with the car clearly improving. The rest wasn’t up to par.”Hamilton and the team are already looking towards 2026, when new regulations offer a chance for a reset and he will have had a full season of acclimatisation. He has been active in pursuing change within Ferrari. It is believed he was somewhat taken aback at the team’s organisation and methodologies when he began working with them and that he felt the decision-making process was ungainly.In Belgium this year he revealed he had held a series of meetings with the key players at Ferrari including Elkann and the chief executive, Benedetto Vigna, and gone as far as compiling two documents detailing suggestions for the progress he believes is needed to turn around their fortunes.Meanwhile,Lando Norris, who won in Brazil, has pointedly played down expectations he is poised to secure his first F1 world championship after taking a commanding lead in the title race, warning he had a long way to go.View image in fullscreenLando Norris enjoys the taste of victory after winning in São Paulo.Photograph: DiaEsportivo/Action Plus/ShutterstockNorris won with a commanding drive from pole at Interlagos while his title rival andMcLarenteammate Oscar Piastri could manage only fifth. Max Verstappen delivered a magnificent performance to come back from 19th to third but his heroics only limited the damage to his title hopes as Norris opened a clear gap on his two competitors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He could afford to finish second to Piastri in all three races and the sprint in Qatar and still seal the title. But he maintained he did not believe the last two races had been a turning point in the championship.“No, it just feels like another weekend where I came here to try and win, to get the most points I could and did that,” he said. “I also did that last weekend. Neither are turning points, they’re just strong results, which is exactly what I need, exactly what I’m fighting for every single weekend.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025FerrariLewis HamiltonCharles LeclercLando NorrisMcLarenFormula OnenewsShareReuse this content"

But football’s governing body, Fifa, does allow athletes with a DSD to compete in the women’s game.However, the majority of insiders expect that Coventry’s campaign pledge will mean any athlete who has gone through male puberty will be banned from the female category.Speculation that the IOC would introduce a new policy as soon as January intensified on Monday after it was reported that its director of health, medicine and science, Dr Jane Thornton, had given a science-based review of the evidence to its members last week, showing there were permanent physical advantages to being born male.Thornton, a former Canadian rower, also explained how some sports bodies, such as World Athletics, were now using the SRY cheek-swab gene test to determine the biological sex of athletes in what was said by one source to be “a factual and dispassionate presentation”.The IOC, however, quickly denied any decision had been made. It is also understood that its working group on the issue is still continuing its deliberations, and the summer of 2026 is a more realistic timeframe for the new policy.Yet while the IOC is set on bringing in a new policy, much remains unclear. Will it follow the lead of World Athletics, with its cheek‑swab test? And can it ensure that any new policy does not face a legal challenge?A statement from the IOC read: “An update was given by the IOC’s director of health, medicine and science to the IOC members last week during the IOC commission meetings. The working group is continuing its discussions on this topic and no decisions have been taken yet. Further information will be provided in due course.”Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeLA Olympic Games 2028Olympic GamesWorld AthleticsTransgenderSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Tygart said that Wada’s intervention was a “desperate attempt to divert attention” from its role in theChinese swimming scandal of 2021.Enhanced Games are dangerous and must be stopped, says Wada headRead more“For an organisation reportedly part of a criminal investigation by US law enforcement, the continued and blatantly false attacks from Wada president [Witold] Banka are a telling smokescreen,” Tygart said. “His attempts to smear America and our US Olympic and professional athletes is a desperate attempt to divert attention away from his failure in allowing China to sweep 23 positive tests under the carpet. Those who value clean and fair sport should stand up and demand that Wada be fixed.”Tygart said a failure to stop the Chinese swimmers who failed drug tests from competing in the Tokyo Games, had allowed “certain athletes to … have their own Enhanced Games”.Wada and Usada havebeen at odds over the Chinese swimming scandalsince details were revealed by reporting last year. An independent review into the affair later criticised Wada’s “disorganisation” but cleared it of bias. In January, however, it emerged that the US government had defaulted on $3.6m of funding for the global body, with Tygart commenting at the time that “Usada fully supports this decision by the United States [government] as the only right choice to protect athletes’ rights and fair competition”.Tygart said the Enhanced Games had “nothing” to do with US enforcement. “We are working closely with our partners Fifa and the ITA to ensure this summer’s World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games are the cleanest on record, and not a repeat of the 2021 and 2024 Games where certain athletes with positive tests were allowed to compete, win, and in a way have their own Enhanced Games,” he said. “The Enhanced Games have nothing to do with our athletes, the World Cup, or the Olympics, and President Banka knows this.”A Wada spokesperson said the staging of the Enhanced Games on US soil was “an embarrassment” for Tygart, adding: “It should surprise no one that Wada – with the support of clean athletes all over the world – has taken a strong and vocal position against the Enhanced Games. It seems incongruous, therefore, that Usada refuses to work with the global anti‑doping community to unite against it.”Explore more on these topicsWadaUsada (United States Anti-Doping Agency)Drugs in sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

I saw it was snowing, and I was like: ‘It’s going to be a good day,’” Rodriguez said.The Cavalry veteran Sergio Camargo said the snowstorm made for conditions unlike anything he had experienced. “I had experience playing in snow in my college years,” Camargo said. “But nothing like that, where the snow was that thick and that difficult to dribble and manipulate the ball. It was the factor for both teams, so not an excuse. Just another addition to what was a very memorable final.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision is massively subjective, in my opinion, but not a clear and obvious error.Starting from the top: the ball is in the back of the netafter Virgil van Dijk’s header from a corner, and the assistant referee, Stuart Burt, flags for offside. The offside player isAndy Robertson, who is in the goal area. When the ball is headed by Van Dijk, Robertson is standing almost in front of the goalkeeper. He then shifts to his left, shifts forward and, with the ball about to strike him, he ducks out of the way and the ball ends up in the net.After hundreds of millions spent on players, what was Liverpool’s plan?Read moreThe goal is disallowed on field, because the flag went up, but as we know when goals are scored they are automatically checked by VAR.To be in an offside position is not an offence in itself; it only matters when you become involved in active play. Robertson was penalised because he was deemed to have made an obvious action that impacted the ability of an opponent, in this case Gianluigi Donnarumma, to play the ball. You can’t say for sure whether Donnarumma would have got the ball and for the video assistant referee, Michael Oliver, to overturn the on-field call he has to have clear evidence that Donnaruma wasnotimpacted. For a VAR intervention you need clear evidence to overturn a decision and there wasn’t any.It would work the other way round, too. If we had seen an on‑field decision of a goal, had we not had an offside offence indicated, then VAR would also not have intervened. It would have been check complete and the goal would have stood. On balance, I would have preferred a goal, but it was not a clear and obvious error to deny one.After the match Arne Slot expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, which he is entitled to do. He mentioned that it had taken 13 seconds for the assistant to raise his flag and said that must have shown there was communication with the referee, perhaps highlighting that this was not a clear decision. The referee and their assistants are in communication with each other constantly. Quite clearly the assistant has a side‑on view, he identifies the offside position, and the referee has a front-on view where he can see if the player in question is committing an offence by impacting an opponent. They are in communication and sometimes decisions take a little bit longer, but there’s nothing untoward about that.View image in fullscreenAndy Robertson (left) remonstrates with the referee, Chris Kavanagh.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersThe VAR protocol is very straightforward: the on-field officials have to make a decision. You have to referee incidents and what VAR is not looking to do is to re-referee them, to break them down into their component parts, because there’s so much going on there. This is a decision that doesn’t warrant unpicking. It’s one that you just leave on the field.It’s clear the incident has frustrated some people and there have been comparisons to previous events. Last season, for example,Manchester Citywere awarded a goal against Wolves, despite Bernardo Silva being in an offside position, because he was adjudged not to be impacting other players. But no two incidents are the same and in the Silva situation there is a significant difference, namely he is clearly to the side of the goalkeeper, several metres from the flight of the ball and doesn’t duck under the ball.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The attacking midfielder started as Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, a result which left them eighth in the table.Nagelsmann has called for patience with the Germany international, however. \"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo,\" he said. \"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\"If you look at the game against City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes. So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal. You see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"\"We all know what he's capable of and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form,\" Nagelsmann added. \"We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\"\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates. That would be one idea, because ... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"Wirtz is part of Nagelsmann's squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia. Victories in both matches will secure Germany's place at the 2026 World Cup finals.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best course of action as we move through the season is to continue to educate as many people as we can in relation to the VAR protocol, in particular with relation to offside. Everybody’s got an opinion on the game; I’ve been to the supermarket and people have stopped me to ask whether I think situations are clear and obvious errors. But when I do speak to fans about how the protocol works, the stock answer I get is: “I didn’t know that.”The protocol is there for all to read and I think sometimes the more education we can get out there, the better it will be. It can help not just pundits but fans so that everyone’s got a better idea. As always, communication is key.Chris Foy is a former Premier League referee.Explore more on these topicsRefereesLiverpoolManchester CityLaws of footballcommentShareReuse this content"

This is muck‑and-nettles stuff, yet the sticky November turf is being graced by players who have tasted the very top.Unsurprisingly, Wythenshawe came into the game in glittering form – and showed no mercy in continuing it. They had already picked up some comfortable victories, winning 6-2, 10-1, 7-1 and 5-2 in the league. Cissé, the former Newcastle striker, scored all six against the Merseyside team Collegiate Old Boys last month, a game that nearly 200 people turned up to watch. There are almost five times that in attendance for their latest match, marvelling as the Ammies’ veterans rack up a 13-0 scoreline. Cissé scored eight goals – all in the second half, after he missed a first-half penalty, with Boyd and Ireland scoring two apiece. The names of the stars are on every fan’s lips.View image in fullscreenPapiss Cissé is all smiles as he exits the pitch at after scoring eight goals against South Liverpool.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The GuardianIt all started with the former Manchester City man Ireland, who is close friends with the Wythenshawe player Blake Norton and was eager for a Sunday afternoon kickabout after playing a “low-key” seven-a-side with some fellow former pros on Tuesday nights. Ireland, who exhibited some fine touches in the game and started the scoring with an inventive volley before providing several assists for Cissé, enlisted some high-calibre ringers.“I came down in pre-season just because I love playing football,” Ireland says. “I love the fitness side of things. I invited some of the others and slowly but surely everyone wants to play.“It’s competitive and it’s going from strength to strength. I didn’t want it to be something where 15 of us ex-pros came in and took over, I want a good mix with the old vets lads. It’s a nice humbling experience to interact with fans as well. It’s great to give back and the club have been so nice to me. We’re all local as well.”The club has been blown away by the growth of the story on social media and the response of the community. The chair, Carl Barratt, says: “Positive press is always good but we’ve not had anything like this before. I’ve even had one of my family members in Australia send me a message – that’s how far we’ve reached.”Barratt is eager to indicate Wythenshawe’s vets were a force to be reckoned with even before the influx of Premier League talent. Last season they won 30 of 32 games under their manager, Kieran Megran, the only defeats coming in two County Cup finals. It was Megran’s drive, and the involvement of Ireland, that really took things to the next level.View image in fullscreenKieran Megran, pictured before his side’s 9-1 win over St John’s in October, won 30 of 32 games last season.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian“It literally started from a conversation about how we can win these County Cups and suddenly we’ve got all these star players,” Barratt says.“We love it, honestly,” Ireland says. “It’s meant to be fun and casual, but even now my phone is lighting up with ex-players saying: ‘How do I sign up?’ And the turnout today was amazing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You do a token 10-minute warm-up, you’re having a laugh and you have a pint afterwards – it’s as good as it’s going to get. The values are obviously different in professional football, but you can enjoy it just as much. It’s like estate football, which is what you enjoyed as a kid. There’s loads of banter. I was chuckling away on the pitch today.”For Barratt, it has gone beyond just winning matches and that elusive search for cup glory. He has been connected to Wythenshawe for 24 years and oversees their 80 teams across all age levels – involving nearly 1,000 children. He was Cole Palmer’s first coach when the current Chelsea forward was a youngster at the club. Barratt and many others have put countless hours into the club, so to see hundreds gather on a Sunday morning for a veterans game is special.“Ultimately, we’re a community‑owned club and this is highlighting what we do in the area. For what Stevie Ireland has done, because he’s been the catalyst to get people involved along with Kieran, it’s been superb.View image in fullscreenStephen Ireland was the ‘catalyst’ to getting other former professional players involved.Photograph: Joel Goodman/The Guardian“Wythenshawe is not the most affluent area but hopefully this can contribute to us getting more players, generating more money and the feelgood factor around the place … you can just sense it.“The other week I was with our president, John Walker, who’s done a lot for the club, and I’m looking across seeing Emile Heskey wearing a Wythenshawe FC striped shirt, standing under the John Walker Stand. So that’s one of the best memories I’m going to have at the club. It’s a funny old game when you see things like that.”Explore more on these topicsFootballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former England forward is alleging she was defamed in two social media posts made by the former Manchester City and England midfield player and that dozens of other posts by Barton amounted to harassment.Joey Barton found guilty of sending offensive posts on social mediaRead moreAfter a preliminary hearing at the high court, Justice Lavender ruled in April that two messages posted by Barton about Aluko on X in January 2024 were defamatory, in one case because of its innuendo meaning. The most contentious elements of Barton’s posts were his claims that Aluko played the “victim card” and “race card”.Barton was found guilty last week in relation to posts directed at Aluko, her fellow football broadcaster Lucy Ward and the broadcaster Jeremy Vine. He denied harassment and seeking to cause distress or anxiety.Barton lost a defamation case last year brought by Vine, which has cost the former footballer more than £500,000, according to Vine. Although Barton was cleared last week of a further six counts of sending offensive messages, he may seek to settle with Aluko rather than risk another large payout determined in court.Aluko’s harassment claim relates to messages sent by Barton when he waged a lengthy online campaign against female commentators and pundits last year.Aluko declined to comment when contacted. In a statement released after last week’s verdict she said Barton’s messages had caused her distress and damaged her media career. “Social media is a cesspit where too many people feel they can say things to others they wouldn’t dream of saying in real life under the guise of freedom of speech,” she said. “This is a reminder that actions online do not come without consequences.“The messages directed at me, Lucy Ward and Jeremy Vine byJoey Bartonwere deeply distressing and had a real damaging impact on my life and career. I am glad that justice has been served.”Barton is due to be sentenced on 8 December, with his bail conditions prohibiting him from mentioning the three victims before then. His legal representatives declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsJoey BartonnewsShareReuse this content"

The VAR agreed that theLiverpooldefender Andy Robertson was “in an offside position and deemed to be making an obvious action directly in front of the goalkeeper” when ducking out the way of Van Dijk’s header as it sailed past Gianluigi Donnarumma.Andrew Robertson admits Liverpool face ‘huge uphill battle’ to retain titleRead moreLiverpool dispute that interpretation and do not believe the City goalkeeper’s line of vision was affected by Robertson. The club are bewildered that VAR did not allow the goal to stand and have contacted Howard Webb, the head of the refereeing body, to challenge the decision. Liverpool do not believe the wording of Law 11 applies to what Robertson did.Law 11 states that a player in an offside position at the moment the ball is played is only penalised on becoming involved in active play by: “Interfering with play by playing or touching a ball passed or touched by a teammate, or interfering with an opponent by: preventing an opponent from playing or being able to play the ball by clearly obstructing the opponent’s line of vision, or challenging an opponent for the ball or clearly attempting to play a ball which is close when this action impacts on an opponent or making an obvious action which clearly impacts on the ability of an opponent to play the ball.”View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk’s goal was disallowed due to Andy Robertson ‘making an obvious action directly in front of the goalkeeper’.Photograph: Darren Staples/AFP/Getty ImagesArne Slot refused to blame the controversy forhis team’s 3-0 defeatin the1,000th game of Pep Guardiola’s managerial career, but insisted that a clear and obvious error had been made by Kavanagh. The Liverpool head coach said: “He [Robertson] didn’t interfere at all with what the goalkeeper could do.Immediately after the game someone showed me the goal that the same referee allowed forCity against Wolves last season[when Bernardo Silva was in an offside position close to the goalkeeper as John Stones scored with a header].Quick GuideNagelsmann blames Wirtz's slow start on Liverpool's formShowJulian Nagelsmann, the Germany head coach, has defended Florian Wirtz after criticism of his slow start to life at Liverpool, pinning some of the blame on the team's poor form and finishing.Wirtz, a £100m summer signing from Bayer Leverkusen, is yet to register a goal or assist in the Premier League – though he has created 16 chances – while Arne Slot's side have struggled to sustain their title defence. The attacking midfielder started as Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, a result which left them eighth in the table.Nagelsmann has called for patience with the Germany international, however. \"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo,\" he said. \"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\"If you look at the game against City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes. So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal. You see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"\"We all know what he's capable of and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form,\" Nagelsmann added. \"We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\"\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates. That would be one idea, because ... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"Wirtz is part of Nagelsmann's squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia. Victories in both matches will secure Germany's place at the 2026 World Cup finals.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“It took the linesman 13 seconds to raise his flag to say it was offside. So there was clearly communication, but as I said that could have influenced the game in a positive way for us. I would like to emphasise the fact that being 2-0 down at half-time was a fair reflection of how the game went.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolManchester CityRefereesLaws of footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The Turkish football federation (TFF) has also suspended 1,024 players pending disciplinary investigations.The TFFsuspended 149 referees and assistant refereesearlier this month, after an investigation found officials working in the country’s professional leagues were betting on football matches.Turkey’s state-owned Anadolu news agency reported that a court had ruled to arrest the Eyupspor chairman, Murat Özkaya, and seven others as part of the investigation. Eyupspor, who play in the top-tier Turkish Super Lig, were not immediately available to comment.In a statement, the TFF said it had sent 1,024 players from all leagues to the Professional Football Disciplinary Council (PFDK) as part of the investigation, including 27 players from the Super Lig, who have all been suspended. Among those 27 were players from champions Galatasaray and Istanbul rivals Besiktas, among others.“Due to the precautionary transfer of 1,024 football players to the PFDK, negotiations have been initiated urgently with Fifa to grant a 15-day transfer and registration period in addition to the 2025-2026 winter transfer period, only at the national level, in order for clubs to complete their squad deficiencies,” the TFF said.It also said matches in the second- and third-tier leagues were suspended for two weeks, while local media said the TFF board would hold an extraordinary meeting at 2pm (GMT) on Tuesday.Football’s world governing body, Fifa, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the investigation and the TFF’s request for a 15-day transfer window.The TFF president, Ibrahim Haciosmanoglu, has described the situation as a “moral crisis in Turkish football”. Its own investigation revealed that 371 of 571 active referees in Turkey’s professional leagues had betting accounts, and 152 of them were actively gambling.One referee had placed bets 18,227 times and 42 referees had bet on more than 1,000 football matches each. Others were found to have bet only once.Explore more on these topicsEuropean club footballTurkeyEuropeRefereesSport bettingnewsShareReuse this content"

Both Renée Slegers and Sonia Bompastor said afterwards that they think theintroduction of video assistant refereeswould be a positive step in helping eliminate the most obvious of errors, such as Blackstenius’s goal being ruled out for a nonexistent handball, and in assisting with the more marginal calls: whether Alessia Russo was offside for her goal or Frida Maanum was offside when her effort was ruled out.The reality is that while there has been a big push to improve the standard of officiating in the Women’s Super League – there is investment in coaching and support around officials and steps are being taken to ensure as many as possible can operate as full-time professionals – refereeing is still playing catchup. VAR brings problems of its own but if technology can lift the pressure on referees in the WSL and help ensure they get the majority of big decisions right then it feels like a no-brainer. It’s a potentially costly endeavour, but if the WSL wants the focus to be on the football in a fixture that, as Bompastor put it, “is one of the most beautiful in the world”, then they need to ensure the controversies are at a minimum, for the sake of the game and the referees.Suzanne Wrack‘We need justice’: Slegers calls for VAR after officials deny ArsenalRusso earns draw with Chelsea but Arsenal rue decisionsShaw shows class in sending City topBy Bunny Shaw’s extremely high standards, it has felt like a slow start to the season for last year’s WSL Golden Boot winner. However, with her goal against Everton on Sunday – a trademark bullet header to make the score 2-1 – she proved once again just how important she is to Manchester City. It should not come as a surprise when you dig into the data. Shaw has the highest expected goals in the league by some margin (5.8), has produced the greatest number of shots (33) and won the most aerial duels (also 33). City could have easily slipped up against the indefatigable Toffees but Andrée Jeglertz has added a new resilience since his arrival. Shaw put this down to “a mentality shift” within the group, one that now has them top for the first time this season.Sophie DowneyWSL roundup: City go top, Liverpool and West Ham stay winlessLionesses produce statement winTwo former Arsenal stars sunk Tottenham asLondon City Lionessesearned their first statement WSL victory. The top-flight debutants have enjoyed a steady start to the season, but Sunday marked their biggest win at this level. The former Arsenal academy graduate Freya Godfrey, who joined in the summer for an undisclosed fee, was player of the match, netting twice and providing an assist. Former Gunner Nikita Parris also got on the scoresheet – and looked thrilled about it as she passionately punched the air in celebration. It would be fair to say the red side of north London was particularly happy with the outcome – especially as it meant Spurs dropped below Arsenal in the table. “It was tough, it was a fight,” Godfrey said. “I think it was more of a fighting game than a tactical game. Sometimes you have those games in football and we had to be ready to adapt to it.”Emillia HawkinsLiverpool let points slip yet againLiverpool have a first point on the board after their 1-1 draw with Brighton but their failure to hold on to a lead continues to be a major concern amid a grim start to the season. Gareth Taylor’s side have now dropped 11 points from games in which they have scored first in their seven WSL fixtures this season. Against Brighton there were real signs of progress. Liverpool looked the slickest they have this term and Beata Olsson turned the ball in at the near post, her second goal in two games, to open the scoring. Fuka Nagano’s effort then forced the Brighton goalkeeper, Chiamaka Nnadozie, to push the ball on to the crossbar and Sam Kerr also hit the woodwork. They created chances, and every manager will point out that you can’t score if you aren’t creating chances, but Liverpool’s conversion rate has to improve to alleviate the pressure a one-goal margin ensures. The concession of the equaliser in the 93rd minute was a cruel blow, but it was one of their own making, again.SWskip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

West Ham were on course for their first win of the season only for Leicester’s Shannon O’Brien to equalise in the 97th minute. “Everyone’s trying really hard to get the result,” the West Ham manager said. “The determination, desire and work-rate in training has been phenomenal … That’s a massive credit to the desire and intent of the side.” There are certainly positives she can take. Her team controlled proceedings for the most part. Once again, however, they were made to pay for their wastefulness in front of goal and had only one shot on target. That lack of quality in end product is the most worrying trend and poses the ultimate question about the mentality of players who get themselves in good positions but are unable to find the back of the net. It is a conundrum that needs to be solved.SDArroyo looks up, not down, for VillaNatalia Arroyo is hopeful that Aston Villa’s win over Manchester United will spur the team on for the rest of the season. Before Saturday’s match she said Villa wanted to “be a problem for the bigger teams” in the league. They certainly achieved that against in-form United away from home. The visitors were clinical when they needed to be while remaining defensively robust to keep a clean sheet and win 1-0. In fact, they could have easily scored a few more in the second half. “We know that for these types of games probably no one expects us to win,” Arroyo said afterwards. “So if we can take something, the point at the Emirates and these three here at United, that allows us to believe and dream bigger.”EHPosTeamPGDPts1Man City Women811212Chelsea Women811203Man Utd Women813174Arsenal Women810155Tottenham Hotspur Women8-1156London City Lionesses8-7127Aston Villa Women71108Brighton & Hove Albion Women8089Leicester Women8-8610Everton Women8-5511Liverpool FC Women7-9112West Ham Women8-161Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballArsenal WomenChelsea WomenManchester City WomenManchester United WomenTottenham Hotspur WomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In fact, they were happy for him, the defeated Espanyol fans who briefly fell silent when he hurt them standing to hand him an ovation when he headed off, the long walk from the pitch ending with another win, a bit like old times. On Saturday night, theVillarrealstriker scored for the third week in a row; it was the first time in two years he had a run like that, his best days finished or so it goes. At 33, it was also the first time he had ever scored against the team where it all began. Which felt right somehow, even when it was wrong.This was a big night. Espanyol came on to the pitch with rescue dogs, the two teams posing together, every man in blue and whitewith a mutt of their own: Marko Dimitrovic led a huge alsatian, Ty Dolan held a husky and Roberto Fernández petted a black puppy. Defeated only once at home, these are the best days they have had for years. The club whose former owner, remote-control car impresario Chen Yansheng, had promised Champions League football in three years andinstead presided over two relegations, are under new management. They have themost popular manager anyone can remember, a former bus driver and the embodiment of what they want to be. And they kicked off in a European place. Win and they would climb to within two points of their opponents and the final Champions League slot.Angers had no money to sign strikers so turned to youth players. It workedRead moreVillarreal though came with Moreno, the opponent that was too briefly theirs. “I’m biased but he’s one of the best strikers around,” the coach had said the day before – and that was theEspanyolcoach. And just because Manolo González is biased that doesn’t mean he’s wrong; if anyone knew the damage Moreno could do, it is him. Raised in Santa Perpètua, the Morenos were a footballing family: Gerard’s dad was a striker, his brother a No 10, and he was a bit of both. A bit better than both too, he joinedEspanyolat eight. When he reached the under-16s, though, Moreno was cut. A 15-year-old who already acted like a professional, serious, a little timid and entirely lacking in ego, he was convinced to join the under-19s at third-tier Badalona. His coach there – his second father, he said – was González, whose journey to the top took quite a lot longer.This will relaunch your career, González told Moreno, and he wasn’t wrong about that either. The season with the Badalona Juvenil started with a 4-1 win against Espanyol B and ended with Moreno having scored 41 times in 32 games. Real Madrid came calling but by then he had given his word to Villarreal, and so it began again, down the east coast. At the end of his first full season in the Villarreal first team, when he scored seven times, he got the chance to go back to Espanyol. But after three years at home, the financial pressure told, reality intervening to see him return to Villarreal in 2018, where he has been ever since, for a whilebecoming the best striker in Spain, roots always remembered.View image in fullscreenEspanyol’s players, including Ty Dolan with a husky, come on to the pitch with rescue dogs as part of a campaign to tackle dog abandonment.Photograph: Urbanandsport/NurPhoto/ShutterstockFootball has left its mark on him, the scar on his face caused by falling off a goal when he had climbed up to collect a ball that landed on top of the net, leaving him needing 27 stitches, and Saturday showed that he has left his mark on Espanyol too. As a ballboy, one of Moreno’s fondest memories was celebrating a goal with Raúl Tamudo, the club’s greatest striker. Twice the winner of the Zarra trophy as the top scoring Spaniard inLa Liga, over his career there would be 108 of his own to celebrate, 39 of them for Espanyol. And yet in 11 years away, he had never had one to celebrate against them. In a dozen years in the top flight Moreno had got goals against every one else – recently promoted Real Oviedo are now the onlyprimeraside against whom he hasn’t found the net – but not his own team. When at last he did have reason to, scoring at the eighth attempt this weekend, there still wouldn’t be any celebration. That much, he said, was always clear.They had been playing 41 minutes when Moreno turned on the edge of the area and struck a first time shot into the corner to give Villarreal a lead which Alberto Moleiro doubled in the second half. The ball had barely hit the net when he lifted his hands like a customer in the Hawthorn Grill. As it did, over on the touchline, cameras caught a moustachioedmosso de esquadra, a Catalan copper, cover his face, gutted. To his left, Espanyol manager González was fuming. His former player, the kid who came from Catalan local football and was an Espanyol fan like him, had done for them. So too had his defenders. For a second there was silence in the stadium and then there was applause.At least it was him. At least he had left them until last, and apologised when the inevitable finally happened. At least this was a way of mutual showing appreciation, sharing a moment a long time coming and, some feared, soon to be gone – to show happy they were to see him back. It was tempting to think the only thing as bad as ever scoring against Espanyol was never scoring against Espanyol, and that had seemed to be coming closer.“Only injury has stopped him being the national team’s striker,” González had said. There was a catalogue of muscular problems, continuity denied. The man who scored 18 league goals in 2019-20 and 23 the year after, then tallied nine, seven, 10 and three. Since the start of last season Moreno had missed 176 days through injury. At 33 and with Villarreal using the sales of Álex Baena, Yeremy Pino and Thierno Barry to spend heavily in the summer, Georges Mikautadze becoming the most expensive signing in their history at €31m, Tani Oluwaseyi arriving too,last season’s top scorer Ayoze Pérezand Nicolas Pépé arriving a summer earlier, it seemed that his time might be up. All the more so when he was forced off at half-time on the opening day, a kind of depressing deja vu about it all. He hadn’t scored a goal from open play sincethat5-3 win over Barcelonain January 2024.View image in fullscreenGerard Moreno fires a shot at goal against Espanyol.Photograph: Javier Borrego/AFP7/ShutterstockBut then it happened: Moreno returned in a 2-2 draw with Betis. The following week, he scored the opener against Rayo Vallecano. The week after he did the same against Valencia. Now he had done it against Espanyol. In three matches he had scored as many goals as in the whole of last season. Fit again, in 313 minutes, he had more than any of Villarreal’s other centre-forwards, still different, still cleverer, still more intuitive, still just, well, better than anyone else. And everyone else is good too: all that in the team that moved briefly in to second, a win away from their best start. “26 points is incredible,” the coach, Marcelino García Toral, said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Outside the top three, no one can compete with Villarreal for budget. In the summer only Real Madrid spent more (although Villarreal’s net spend saw them post a profit). Espanyol’s best player, the full-back Carlos Romero, is on loan from Villarreal and Espanyol didn’t want to pay the €150,000 to release him: his replacement was burned up by Tajon Buchanan for the second goal. There has always been a reason Moreno wasn’t there for longer too. “I would love to work with Gerard again,” González had said, “but for now the economics say he is he’s out of reach of Espanyol.”Instead, all they could do was applaud, so they did, happy for him and hoping that one day their paths can cross again. “I spent many years and I’m so grateful for the affection they show me,” Moreno said at the end, the stands empty now but for a group of Espanyol supporters singing the name of the man who had scored against them at last. “There’s lots of emotion every time I come here, and a lot of respect. Now that I feel good again, all I want to do is enjoy this moment.” And with that he left, the same slightly shy striker he always was slipping down the tunnel and out of sight, waving a little awkwardly as he went.PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid1216312Barcelona1217283Villarreal1214264Atletico Madrid1213255Real Betis126206Espanyol120187Athletic Bilbao12-1178Getafe12-2179Sevilla12-11610Alaves1201511Elche12-11512Rayo Vallecano12-21513Celta Vigo12-31314Real Sociedad12-31315Mallorca12-61216Osasuna12-41117Valencia12-101018Girona12-131019Levante12-7920Oviedo12-138Explore more on these topicsLa LigaVillarrealEspanyolEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "3h ago17.00 ESTJannik Sinner got his title defence on home soil at the ATP Finals off to a solid start with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Félix Auger-Aliassime, who struggled with a calf injury.As the Italian clinched a tight first set with a break in the 14th game, Auger-Aliassime suffered a problem with his left calf and was twice treated by a trainer during the second set. It remains to be seen whether the Canadian, whose place in Turin was only confirmed on Sunday, will be fit to play his remaining two group games.“It was very tough until 6-5 and then he had a physical issue,” said Sinner, who won the title here last year without dropping a set. “It’s a special tournament and place for me,” he added as fans chanted his name during the post-match interview.On his opponent’s injury, Sinner said: “I hope it’s not too serious and wish him a speedy recovery and he gets back to 100% physically. You don’t want to win like this but if there’s a chance you have to use it. It’s not nice, Félix has had some tough injuries so we wish him the best.”To claim the year-end No 1 ranking. Sinner needs to win theATP Finalsand hope that his great rival, Carlos Alcaraz, does not reach the final. Sinner and Alexander Zverev lead the Bjorn Borg Group with a win each after Zverev beat Ben Shelton on Sunday.Earlier on Monday,Taylor Fritzbeat late entryLorenzo Musetti6-3, 6-4 in the Jimmy Connors Group. Unlike Musetti, who was making his debut, Fritz has pedigree in the tournament after reaching the final last year and the semifinals on his debut in 2022.“A very important one to win, I would say, if I want to make it out of the group,” Fritz said. “He plays quite different with the slices and everything. So it took me some time to get used to it. I was able to avoid getting broken early … then I feel like I kind of got into the match more. I thought I played really well.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Fritz reached the final in Turin last year, losing to Jannik Sinner.Photograph: Claudio Benedetto/IPA Sport/ShutterstockMusetti would have qualified at Auger-Aliassime’s expense with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Athens final on Sunday – but despite losing, he earned a place as Djokovic withdrew from the ATP Finals with a shoulder injury.“I couldn’t be at 100% in shape, especially physically,” said Musetti, who arrived in his home town on Sunday evening. “Mentally, I’m really glad that I’m here. I’m super proud of myself, of my team, of what we achieved. Today, I tried to fight with what I had.”Fritz and Alcaraz lead the group with one win each, while Alex de Minaur and Musetti are yet to get on the board. On Tuesday, Fritz plays Alcaraz in the afternoon match before Musetti faces De Minaur in a likely eliminator.Associated Press/PA MediaDoubles delight for British trioIn the doubles event, Britain’sJoe SalisburyandNeal Skupskiwon their opening match against Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic by a score of 6-3, 7-5. Another British player,Henry Patten, also enjoyed victory alongside Finland’sHarri Heliövaara. The pair beat US duo Christian Harrison and Evan King 6-4, 6-4.Monday’s results mean that Salisbury and Skupski, the fifth seeds, lead the John McEnroe Group alongside second seeds Heliövaara and Patten.

The two British & Irish Lions players sat out training on Monday and their ­participation against the All Blacks is in jeopardy.Chessum is struggling with a foot injury and was seen on crutches at England’s training base in Bagshot. He was replaced after 70 minutes ofthe 38-18 win against Fiji on ­Saturdayand in the likely event he is ruled out Maro Itoje’s expected second‑row partner would be Alex Coles.It would be dereliction of Borthwick’s duty not to harness Arundell’s raw talent | Gerard MeagherRead moreFreeman was also replaced in the later stages of the victory and it is understood he is nursing a hamstring injury. The 24-year-old has become an integral part of England’s back-line, starting at outside-centreagainst Australiabefore moving back to the right wing against Fiji.He has started all ­England matches he has been available for since the start of 2024 and his absence would be a considerable blow.Elliot Daly has returned to full training, but has not played sincehe fractured an armwhen with the Lions in June and it would be a huge call to throw him straight back into action against New Zealand. ­Freddie ­Steward (hand) and Tom Roebuck (ankle) missed out against Fiji, but have returned to training. If they are not available, England would be ­facing a back-three crisis.Steward started against Australia and would appear to be in ­competition with Daly for the No 15 jersey if Steve Borthwick does not keep Marcus Smith at full-back. If Roebuck is fit he would be the expected ­replacement for Freeman.Borthwick did reveal that Freeman was back under consideration to start in the No 13 jersey against New ­Zealand, but Ollie Lawrence would ­probably remain at outside­-centre if the ­Northampton Saint is unavailable.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman flies down the wing against Fiji. His absence against New Zealand would be a big problem for England.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockChessum has endured a series of serious injuries on ­international duty. He missed all of the autumn ­campaign last year after a knee injury at ­England’s preparation camp in Girona and nearly missed out on the 2023 World Cup because of an ankle injury in the Six Nations that year.Borthwick is not blessed with a wealth of second-row options and if Itoje and Coles are named to start on Saturday ­Chandler ­Cunningham-South would be pressed into providing cover. He started at No 8 against Fiji, but ­Borthwick is expected to reshuffle his back row  with Sam Underhill coming back in the fold.The 29-year-old destructive tackler sat out the victory against Fiji but has started 13 of England’s matches since the 2023 World Cup and is rarely omitted if fit. It would be a surprise if Tom Curry, who has come off the bench in both England’s matches this autumn, did not return to the starting lineup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Robertson said: “Obviously, we’ve given ourselves a huge uphill battle, but I don’t think any of the teams will really look at the league table until we’re halfway through.“That’s what we’ve got to do but we’ve got to pick up points on a more consistent basis. Then let’s see where we are after Christmas time or whatever. We’ve just got to focus on ourselves and focus on performance levels.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s footballRead more“I don’t think you can talk about the title this early on in the season, regardless of what position you’re in, but you need to then consistently start winning games again for that to even come into question. It’s definitely not a question that’s getting spoken about in the changing room or anything.“We just need to get back to the levels that we know we can, the levels that we brought the last two games in particular. If we do that on a more regular basis, then we pick up more points than we won’t.”Liverpool were trailing 1-0 when Virgil van Dijk’s header was ruled out after Robertson, standing in an offside position, was adjudged to have interfered with play.Quick GuideNagelsmann blames Wirtz's slow start on Liverpool's formShowJulian Nagelsmann, the Germany head coach, has defended Florian Wirtz after criticism of his slow start to life at Liverpool, pinning some of the blame on the team's poor form and finishing.Wirtz, a £100m summer signing from Bayer Leverkusen, is yet to register a goal or assist in the Premier League – though he has created 16 chances – while Arne Slot's side have struggled to sustain their title defence. The attacking midfielder started as Liverpool slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Manchester City on Sunday, a result which left them eighth in the table.Nagelsmann has called for patience with the Germany international, however. \"To be honest, the overall situation doesn't make it easy for Flo,\" he said. \"The whole club isn't as stable this year as it was last year. It's much harder to slip into the team now.\"If you look at the game against City, they were actually the worse team over the 90 minutes. So it's also difficult for Flo to make a big impact. Ultimately, the overall situation is such that he just needs a little more time, which is normal. You see that with other players who move to the Premier League too.\"\"We all know what he's capable of and it's perfectly normal for a player of his age to go through a bit of a dip in form,\" Nagelsmann added. \"We can't expect him to perform at the same level for three years straight.\"\"Instead, we all need to support him a little bit so that he can clear his head here, and then maybe Liverpool could also help him out by scoring some of the chances he creates. That would be one idea, because ... they somehow don't like to shoot the ball in, that's also part of the truth.\"Wirtz is part of Nagelsmann's squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Luxembourg and Slovakia. Victories in both matches will secure Germany's place at the 2026 World Cup finals.Will MageeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Robertson admitted Liverpool “would have probably been fortunate to be on level terms” but said: “We think it’s an OK goal. I can’t really comment on it; I think we’ll let other people do that. But for me, it looks as if I duck out the way – I don’t think the keeper is in any eyeline to me. That’s the rules we got told at the start of the season, so it was a little bit of a difficult one.”The defeat followed wins against Aston Villa and Real Madrid. Robertson said: “We wanted to end a really strong week but it wasn’t meant to be. We were making strides and then obviously getting a knock [at City].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Belgian was asked what was said: “We were talking during the training session sometimes about when I shoot and how my body position is and we were just talking about that now when I score.So it was a quick joke. It’s difficult to explain: just that I have to put my body above the ball when I shoot the ball so I can put more power, something like that.”Doku believes there is more to come from him. “I’m 23 years old, I hope this is not my peak level. I hope I can still improve, improve my finishing, improve my movements in the box, improve my decision making, improve on my awareness when I have the ball.

I just, enough.”Then last week the OpenAI chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, suggested that the US government could underwrite some of the chip spending.“This is where we’re looking for an ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental, the ways governments can come to bear,” she told the Wall Street Journal, adding that such a guarantee “can really drop the cost of financing”.Was OpenAI, which recently announced it is becoming a fully fledgedfor-profit companyworth $500bn, really saying that AI companies should be treated like banks in the late 2000s? This triggered immediate attempts at clarification from Friar, who took to LinkedIn to deny that OpenAI was seeking a federal backstop, while Altman sought to set the record straight on X.In a long post, Altman wrote “we do not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters”, adding that taxpayers should not bail out companies that make “bad business decisions”. Instead, perhaps, the government should build its own AI infrastructure and give loan guarantees to support chip manufacturing in the US.Benedict Evans, a tech analyst, says OpenAI is trying to match the other big AI players such as Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Google and Microsoft – itself a leading backer of OpenAI – which are supported by their already hugely profitable business models.“OpenAI wants to match or exceed the infrastructure – the tens and hundreds of billions of dollars of compute – of the big platform companies. But those companies have cashflows from their existing businesses to pay for this and OpenAI does not, so it’s trying to bootstrap its way into the club,” he says.View image in fullscreenAltman believes that $1.4tn can be paid off by future demand for OpenAI products and by ever-improving models.Photograph: Stephen Brashear/APThere are also questions over the circular nature of some of OpenAI’s compute deals. For instance, Oracle will spend $300bn building new datacentres for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin – and OpenAI will then pay back roughly the same amount to use those datacentres.Under the terms of a transaction with Nvidia, the leading maker of the chips that AI companies use, OpenAI will pay Nvidia in cash for chips, and Nvidia will invest in OpenAI for non-controlling shares.Altman also addressed the revenue issue, writing that OpenAI expects to end the year above $20bn in annualised revenue and then grow to “hundreds of billion[s]” by 2030.He added: “Based on the trends we are seeing of how people are using AI and how much of it they would like to use, we believe the risk of OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It makes its revenues from ChatGPT subscriptions for consumers –which account for 75% of its income– and offering businesses its corporate versions of ChatGPT, while also allowing companies and start ups to build their own products with its AI models.One Silicon Valley investor, who does not have a financial interest in OpenAI, says OpenAI can build on its popularity but its success is contingent on factors such as the models improving, the cost of operating them getting cheaper and the chips used to power them becoming less costly.“The belief is that OpenAI can leverage its strong brand and ChatGPT’s position as a popular choice among consumers and businesses to build a suite of high value and high margin products. The question is at what scale can they build out these products and revenue models and how good can these models get,” says the investor.But it is loss-making. OpenAI says reporting of its losses, including reports that it lost $8bn in the first half of the year and about $12bn in the third quarter, are inaccurate, although it does not deny it loses money or provide alternative figures.Altman believes the revenue will come from a number of sources. For instance: growing demand for paid-for versions of ChatGPT; other companies using its datacentres; people buying thehardware devices it is buildingwith iPhone designer Sir Jony Ive; and that “huge value” will be created by AI’s achievements in scientific research.So that is the bet: OpenAI needs $1.4tn worth of compute, a number dwarfing its current revenues, because it believes demand and ever better iterations of its products will pay it off.Carl Benedikt Frey, author of How Progress Ends and the associate professor of AI and work at Oxford University, is sceptical about OpenAI’s hopes and points to recentevidence of a slowdownin AI adoption in the world’s largest economy. The US Census Bureau, for instance,reportedthat AI adoption has been declining in recent months among companies with more than 250 employees.“On various measures AI adoption has been falling in the US since the summer. We do not know exactly why, but it does suggest that we are at a stage where some users and businesses feel they are not quite getting what they hoped for from AI so far,” says Frey, adding that without “new breakthroughs” at the company he does not see it reaching $100bn in revenue by 2027 – a figure Altman hashinted at.OpenAI says it is seeing accelerating business adoption, with the corporate version of ChatGPT growing nine times year over year as it gains customers from an array of sectors including banking, life sciences and manufacturing.Altman acknowledged on X, nonetheless, that the bet might not pay off.“But of course we could be wrong, and the market – not the government – will deal with it if we are.”Explore more on these topicsOpenAITechnology sectorSam AltmanArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We were in Oregon wine country, in a rustic-chic barn that reeked of stealth wealth, for a friend’s rehearsal dinner. “This venue is perfect,” I told the groom-to-be. He leaned in as if to tell me a secret: “I found it onChatGPT.”I smiled tightly as this man described using generative AI for the initial stages of planning the wedding. (They also hired a human wedding planner.) I responded politely. Inside, however, I resolved: if my future spouse came to me with wedding input courtesy of ChatGPT, there would be no wedding.Some people have the typical relationship non-negotiables. Doesn’t smoke, is a cat person, wants kids. Over the past few months, as warnings of an impending AI-induced doomsday have dominated my news feed and party conversations, I’ve come up with a new one. I will not date someone who uses ChatGPT. (Or any generative AI program really, but with700 million weekly users, ChatGPT is by far the most popular and thus the object of my scorn.)I’ve heard all the “what ifs”.What if I use it for my job, but I hate it otherwise? What if I use it to help people? What if I only use it as a proofreading tool – I’d never use it to “write” anything.To all that I say: there are people out there for you. But I am not one of them.Golden retriever boyfriends and ick lists: gen Z’s dating rules are making them ‘constantly disappointed’Read more“Getting the ick”is what we sometimes call being turned off. Part of having an ick is not really understandingwhyyou found someone’s behavior so unseemly. For instance, I once got the ick watching a man drink a smoothie from a straw. At first, my ChatGPT aversion felt like a mere ick, a kneejerk feeling of disgust that lacked any solid reasoning.But here we are, in fall 2025, and using the program even for benign tasks such as figuring out a fitness routine or deciding what to wear feels an increasingly political choice. We know that the energy-intensive techdrains our water supplyandhikes electricity bills. It is sold as a placebo forhuman connection; lonely, disconnected people finding companionship or evenfalling in lovewith code is not as much a sci-fi plot point as it is just the way things go now. The megarich tech bros in charge of all this think in terms of profit first and people second.OK, so ChatGPT helps you write your grocery list. Does your individual convenience outweigh the societal harm it can cause?As if it hadn’t done enough already, ChatGPT has somehow made dating even worse. A good friend recently told me that she spent a night with a man, and in the morning suggested they get breakfast together. He took out his phone, opened ChatGPT, and asked for restaurant suggestions. Why get close to someone who outsources decisions, including the fun ones like picking where to eat? If someone is so lazy they’ll hit up ChatGPT to plan a first date, imagine how little effort they’ll spend six months in.I just cannot imagine forming a deep, lasting connection with someone who regularly interacts with a technology that’s kneecapping our collective attention spans and perhaps heralding total apocalypse. Intellectual curiosity, creativity, originality – I probably won’t find what I value in someone who thinks “productivity” means asking an app to summarize a movie plot so they don’t have to waste their time, you know, watching it.Ask yourself if your [dating] preference is truly serving your long-term goalsAli JacksonAli Jackson, a dating and relationship coach based in New York, uses ChatGPT for some tasks – but she is not an evangelist. In the past six months or so, she says “every one” of her clients has come to her complaining about “chatfishing” or people who use AI to generate everything on their dating apps – all the way down to the DMs they send. I asked Jackson if my strike against ChatGPT chumps was too harsh. She said no, go forth and judge, though it might limit my dating pool –about 10% of the adult population nowusesthe tech.“Ask yourself if your preference is truly serving your long-term goals,” Jackson said. “In your case, I would assume that’s one of your values, and it’s important to find someone whose values are aligned with yours.”Other people get the AI ick, and not just when it comes to dating. Ana Pereira, 26, lives in Brooklyn and does sound for various live music venues across the city. She fantasizes about going into her phone settings and deactivating AI features on all her apps, though tech platforms from Google to Spotify make it nearly impossible to opt out. Pereira thinks that using ChatGPT “shows such a laziness”.“It’s like you can’t think for yourself, and you have to rely on an app for that,” she said.Two of Pereira’s friends recently had a messy breakup. She sided with one of them after learning the other went to ChatGPT, a notoriously awful therapyalternative, not their partner, when they wanted to talk about their feelings. “It’s like they didn’t want to sit through any uncomfortable human feelings,” she said. “They just wanted to process something and move on, which is not how things work.”Suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work]Luciano NoijeenRichard Barnes, who is 31 and works as a marine biologist and restaurant server in Hawaii, is similarly weary. “I don’t know if I would think differently about someone who uses ChatGPT, but I would be like, ‘come on,’” he said. “You don’t need to rely on it to make a grocery list. Your life is probably not that hard. We can make the list together.”When director Guillermo del Toro said he would “rather die” than use generative AI, it made headlines. Ditto for SZA’s Instagram storiestiradeagainst the tech warning about “environmental racism” and expressing fear over users who are “codependent on a machine”. Ditto still for whenSimu Liu,Alison Roman,Céline Dion,Emily Blunt, and others make statements that are critical of AI in their various industries. I think these quotes go viral for a reason: people agree with them.Even, to an extent, the people who power the tech industry. Last month, Pinterest added a filter that lets usersturn offAI content. Meta lets users mute, but not entirely deactivate, similar slop on Instagram. The Informationreportedthat “cursor resistance” is on the rise, as some Silicon Valley techies won’t use AI to write their code.The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’Read moreLuciano Noijeen, a lead software engineer based in Greece and the Netherlands, told me that he enthusiastically used AI in the past to write or punch up his coding. Over time, he found he could not code on his own. “I’d done it on autopilot in the past,” said Noijeen, who is 27. “Then suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work].”Noijeen stopped using AI to code, and uses it very sparingly in his personal life. He will make fun of friends who use it too much. He recently met up with an old friend who lives a three-hour train ride away. They decided to meet in the middle. The friend said he would use ChatGPT to find the right spot, but Noijeen just looked at a map. “There’s a city exactly between us,” he said. “Why do you need to ask ChatGPT for that?”It’s not that I want to date a machine-smashing luddite (though I wouldn’t beopposed). Naive as it may sound, I want to live a life free of ChatGPT’s chokehold. I recently put this stance on a dating app profile, answering Hinge’s “You should *not* go out with me if” prompt with: “you use ChatGPT for literally anything.” It helps get the point across.Explore more on these topicsDatingRelationshipsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatGPTfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, it is best to install a charger – a dedicated AC station that operates at much faster speeds and connects to the vehicle via a cable.Many home chargers will charge at a maximum rate of 7.4kW, which means a typical EV will be able to do 25-30 miles for every hour it is plugged in.View image in fullscreenInstalling a dedicate electric vehicle charger at home can cost between £800 and £1,200.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PAAuto Express puts the average cost of installing a charger at between £800 and £1,200. Governmentgrants of £350 are availableif you rent your home or own a flat with private off street parking or a house that has on-street parking.You will need a smart meter so that your energy supplier can check your usage throughout the day to apply the correct rates at different times (see below).Charging is more straightforward for drivers with a driveway or garage than for the 9.3 million households without an off-street parking space. Some local authorities have on-street residential charging points, such as in lamp posts.The government is considering removing the planning permission requirementto install cross pavement ‘gullies’ through which cables run from home to car.The tariffsAll of the main energy suppliers have at least one EV tariff, which typically allow owners to charge their car at specific times of the day for cheaper rates.The energy regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, sayspeople on the default tariff pay an average of 26p a kilowatt hourbut many specialist EV tariffs charge less than 8p/kWh at night.View image in fullscreenLong-distance drivers should look for the cheapest night rate and the longest charging window.Photograph: Johner Images/AlamyBen Gallizzi of the comparison site Uswitch says there are different types of deals available for drivers. The “classic” EV tariff allows drivers to charge during a cheap window overnight. For example theBritish Gas tariffcosts 9p/kWh from midnight to 5am;E.ON’s Next Driveis 7.5p/kWh between 12am to 6am andScottish Power’s EV Savercosts 7.2p/kWh from midnight to 5am.Then there are intelligent smart tariffs that schedule the car to charge at the cheapest times of the day – such as when demand is lower or when there is more renewable energy on the grid. You plug in your car and tell the system how much charge is needed. It starts charging the car when energy is cheapest.Intelligent Octopus Go, for example, charges 7p/kWh.A new type of plan on the market is the subscription pack, says Gallizzi. Octopus’sIntelligent Drive Packoffers unlimited smart charging for £30 a month.Ovo’s Charge Anytimestarts at £27.50, with a limit of 700 miles of smart charging a month.Some EV tariffs are only available if you are an existing customer to the supplier. So if you want to avail of a particular tariff, you may have to switch to that provider first on a regular tariff and then move on to the EV tariff.When assessing which is the best value for your car,Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert site warnsthat many “two-tier” tariffs, where there are different rates depending on the time, can have peak rates that exceed the price cap along with the attractive night time rates. For example, Intelligent Octopus Go’s day rate is about 29p/kWh while the default tariff is 26p.View image in fullscreenFor city drivers, smart charging options could be the better option, say experts.Photograph: SouthWorks/AlamyThere is also the potential for savings through salary sacrifice schemes, where the cost of charging at home is deducted from eligible people’s gross salary before tax and national insurance are taken off. With theElectric Car Scheme’s charge card, employees pay their utility bill and give the mileage to their employer which then gives a reimbursement in the next pay cheque.How to chooseThe best deal will depend on your mileage.Gallizzi says that long distance drivers should look for the cheapest night rate and the longest charging window. “The goal is to make sure you’re fully charging your vehicle every night so you’re good to go in the morning,” he says. For example,E.ON’s NextDrive Smartcosts 6.5p/kWh between midnight and 6am.For city drivers, smart charging could be the better option, he says. “The system should find the cheapest charging slot for you.” As well as Intelligent Octopus Go, there is alsoScottish Power’s EV Optimisetariff, which charges 9p/kWh.Explore more on these topicsMotoringElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In August, a tiny brain implant successfullydecodedthe inner speech of paralysis patients. In October, an eye implantrestored sightto patients who had lost their vision.It would just be better, say experts, if the most famous investors in the space – tech magnates such as Elon Musk and OpenAI’s Sam Altman – were less interested in uploading their brains to computers or merging with AI.“It’s distorting the debate a lot,” said Marcello Ienca, a professor of neuroethics at the Technical University of Munich. “There is this long-term concern regarding the narratives they use.”Michael Hendricks, a professor of neurobiology at McGill, said: “Rich people who are fascinated with these dumb transhumanist ideas” are muddying public understanding of the potential of neurotechnology. “Neuralink is doing legitimate technology development for neuroscience, and then Elon Musk comes along and starts talking about telepathy and stuff.”Silicon Valley firms have ramped up investment in neurotechnologies in the past years, with Altman in August co-founding Merge Labs, a competitor to Musk’s Neuralink. Apple and Meta are both working on wearable devices that leverage neural data: awristbandfor Meta, EEGheadphonesfor Apple.At this point, said Ienca, most of the US’s big tech companies have dedicated research on neurotechnology: Google’s neural mappingproject, for example, or Meta’s acquisition of Ctrl Labs. “The neurotech game is really in the process of going mainstream,” he said.These technologies have considerable near-term potential to treat a variety of neurological issues – from ALS to Parkinson’s to paralysis. The problem is, their investors don’t always appear to have curing disease as an end goal.Musk hassaidbrain-computer interfaces like Neuralink’s may one day allow people to “upload [their] memories” and “download them into a new body or a robot body”. Altman, though quieter on the subject, hasbloggedabout the impending “merge” between humans and machines – which he suggested would either through genetic engineering or plugging “an electrode into the brain”. (In 2018, Altmaninvestedin a “100% fatal” brain-uploading startup, paying $10,000 to join its waiting list.)To be clear, technologies like brain uploading are a long way off, Hendricks and Ienca said: in fact, they’re probably impossible, at least in the foreseeable future. “Biological systems are not like computers,” Hendricks said.Some worry, however, that far-fetched narratives could stymie actual health advances – for example, by pushing regulators to adopt broad, fear-drivenlaws.View image in fullscreenElon Musk has said people may one day ‘upload [their] memories’ and then ‘download them into a new body or a robot body’.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersKristen Mathews, a lawyer who works on mental privacy issues at the US law firm Cooley, said all this “sci-fi hype could trigger regulation that would hinder advances in technology that would otherwise have the potential to really help people who need help”.“It’s completely unrealistic, and it’s hiding the real questions,” said Hervé Chneiweiss, a neuroscientist whochaireda panel of experts advising Unesco on its global standards for neurotechnology,adoptedon Wednesday.The actual frontier of neurotechnology is best understood as encompassing three distinct categories. There are medical devices, such as the brain implants that decode speech, or Neuralink’s electronicchipthat allowed a man with a spinal injury to control a computer. There are consumer wearables, a newer frontier that includes devices such as EEG earbuds or, more loosely, glasses such as Apple’s VisionPro thattrackyour eye movements.Then there are the science-fiction efforts, such as Nectome, the brain-uploadingstartup, orKernel, which aims to link brains to computers, or Neuralink’s recent efforts totrademarkthe name Telepathy.The first category promises the most powerful advances: restoring vision and hearing, and treating neurodegenerative diseases or perhaps psychiatricdisorders. But these devices are extremely tightly regulated – as are all medical devices – and far less advanced than more hype-driven reporting sometimes suggests. A recentpaperin Frontier in Human Neuroscience decried the “misleading propaganda” around brain-computer interfaces, saying the technology was still in its infancy.The second category, consumer wearables, are a thornier regulatory problem. While there has been a spate of reporting on privacy-invasive brain-measuring devices – for example, China’s much-discussed EEG helmets that supposedly monitor constructionworkersfor fatigue, orpupilsfor focus – it’s far less clear that these have ever worked, or pose a real surveillance risk.“The evidential robustness of the systems is very limited. There are very few replicable studies,” said Ienca.Hendricks says devices such as EEG earphones – which companies like Emotiv, for example, are now marketing – are unlikely to be an effective surveillance tool because the data is too noisy and, like signals from a lie detector, unreliable in individual cases.Chneiweiss, however, argues that they raise real concerns: “If they are used in the workplace, they could monitor your brain fatigue or things like that, and the data could be used to discriminate.”The science-fiction applications, meanwhile, often rely on the premise that healthy people would voluntarily get invasive brain implants – to communicate with computers, for example, or move objects with their minds.This is unlikely. If it happened, and if the technology advanced, it might well raise surveillance concerns. But, Hendricks said, it’s extremely unclear if such surveillance would be significantly more useful than the vast amount of granular data – browser histories and purchase data – that big tech companies already have.“We have so many ways to influence people through language and simple visual media,” Hendricks said. “I don’t think that [brain implants] would catch up for a long time.”As for brain uploading, Hendricks said the idea came from people in technology who “think about computers too much”, convincing themselves that the brain is hardware and the self is software that can be run on it – or in a computer, or on a robot.“If I could really be uploaded to be made immortal in a computer, then I should be happy to just kill myself right now as long as someone tells me, like, oh, you’re living in that metal box over there,” he said. “But I don’t think many people would take that bet. I think instinctively we know that’s bullshit.”Explore more on these topicsNeuroscienceMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

The cheek of it.Donald Trumpdescribing the BBC as “corrupt” while threatening to take legal action. Karoline Leavitt, The Donald’s White House mouthpiece, calling the BBC “100% fake news”. The man has never been known for his self-awareness so it’s safe to say the irony has almost certainly passed him by. If you’re being charitable, let’s just say that maybe it takes fake news to spot fake news.The US president is a master of the lie. Makes Boris Johnson look something of an amateur. Boris always followed a lie with a giveaway smirk. He couldn’t help himself. It was an integral part of his self-destruction. As if, buried deep down in his subconscious, there was a part of him that wanted to be found out.But The Donald does it with a straight face. Knowing that no one dare call him out. During his recent state visit to the UK, Trump told a press conference he had ended a war between Albania and Azerbaijan. A war no one – not least the Albanians and the Azerbaijanis – knew was taking place. Keir Starmer just nodded and said nothing. No point in creating a diplomatic incident. Whatever it takes to stay on the right side of Trump.Maybe theBBCcould learn a thing or two from The Donald. Or even from Boris. Because when push came to shove, its Panorama team didn’t make a very good job of its untruth. Possibly because it hasn’t had as much practice. For the most part, the Beeb aspires to the highest standards of impartiality in its news journalism. Often to the point where it goes out of its way to find a climate change denier to balance its stories on global warming.Yet in the Panorama programme on the Capitol riots, the BBC messed up big time. Splicing together two separate clips 50 minutes apart from the same speech to make it sound as if Trump had been inciting violence.What’s more it was all so unnecessary. Everyone already knew that Trump didn’t accept the result of a democratically held election. There was no need to lay it on any thicker. People understood exactly what The Donald thought. He had been hiding in plain sight. Yet Panorama tampered with the footage and inevitably got caught out. As was bound to happen. After all, it wasn’t even that subtle.Why the BBC is apologising over a Trump documentary – and what happens nextRead moreAnd now it’s open warfare on the Beeb. Apologies and theresignation of Tim Davie, the director general, and Deborah Turness, the head of news, are merely the start of the pile-on. Everyone with a grievance and an agenda are now queueing up to put the boot in. Some within the organisation itself. There’s something uniquely British about that. Anyone not on message in Fox News gets turfed out. In the Beeb, the harshest critics often get promoted to positions of authority. We call it accountability and self-reflection.Bashing the BBC is something of a national pastime. Though it’s hard to find another news broadcaster that is quite as trusted anywhere in the world – not to mention its entertainment, education and sport channels – we Brits like nothing more than to give it a kicking. Some on the right reckon it’s a hotbed of well-off Islington socialists; some on the left think it has long been held hostage by the Conservative party. So you might think it was probably getting things just about right. Up until times such as now when it gets it wrong.First out of the blocks wasNigel Farage. Of course it was. Nige the presenter on GB News, a channel that makes no pretence to impartiality. Nige, the man who makes Panorama look like amateurs in the way he self-edits his own life. As the Reform UK leader tries to position himself as a mainstream politician, his past is increasingly erased.Nige was using the parliamentary recess to hold his customary Monday morning press conference in central London. This time the presser was meant to be about small businesses – his main thrust seemed to be that Brexit had been a disaster; Nige is now almost Trumpian in his reinvention – but most of the questions were predictably about the Beeb.“The BBC is institutionally biased,” he declared. “Just look at the way it covers net zero and climate change.” Nige seemed to think that reporting the science that is accepted by more than 95% of the world’s scientists was a major dereliction of duty. There wasn’t nearly enough coverage for the average climate denier. In the same way there wasn’t enough broadcast journalism for those who believe the world is flat. They also pay their licence fee. Do they not count?Balance was everything. Rather than just showing a programme on the 6 January riots, surely the BBC should have devoted as much air time to how Kamala Harris had been inciting people to march on the Capitol. The fact that she hadn’t done anything like this was not a problem. The Beeb had a duty to make something up. You can’t just have Trump undermining democracy. Because that would be undemocratic. To redress its lies, the BBC should also just broadcast its entire coverage of the riots unedited. Or perhaps not.Nige had been on the phone to Trump on Friday, he said. And The Donald had not been happy. Was this the way to treat an ally, he had complained. The riots would have been sanctified by the founding fathers. A thing of wonder. So Nige was pretty much done with the Beeb. Apart from the BBC World Service. But everything else could go. The days of the licence fee were numbered. He would be talking to Nadine Dorries. Good luck with that. Mad Nad has made a habit of being wrong about almost anything.Other politicians kept a lower profile. Kemi Badenoch put out a statement saying the BBC was institutionally biased. She too reckons everyone who works for them are secret commies. Labour didn’t quite know what to do – on the one hand this, on the other hand that – and only Ed Davey mustered any real support. Yes, it had fucked up but it was still a globally respected broadcaster that deserved our support.It just so happened that as Samir Shah, the BBC chair, delivered his own apologia, the Beeb also chose to announce a second series of The Celebrity Traitors. There’s also the possibility of a further spinoff of The Political Traitors. The only difference being that there’s only one faithful.Explore more on these topicsBBCThe politics sketchDonald TrumpNigel FarageTim DavieTelevision industrycommentShareReuse this content"

The government must defend it from its enemies, within and withoutMon 10 Nov 2025 12.30 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 12.36 ESTShareThe BBC is under attack as never before.Donald Trumpand his cronies have it squarely in their sights – and there are no prizes for guessing why. The BBC is the world’s number one source of trusted news, so of course snake-oil salesmen such as Trump see it as their enemy. If your power is built on conspiracy theories and distortions of the truth, the last thing you want is respected, independent journalists exposing that and holding you to account.That’s why rightwing populists have been attacking the BBC for years. Dominic Cummings (remember him?) once oversaw a report that called it the “mortal enemy” of the Conservative party and set out a plan to undermine it with a new “Fox News equivalent”. In 2019, Nigel Farage called the BBC “the enemy”. In 2021, Boris Johnson appointed two Conservative cronies – Richard Sharp and Robbie Gibb – to the BBC board, as chair and non-executive director respectively.And now the president of the United States is getting in on the act. Attacking its journalists as “corrupt”. Rejoicing at the resignation of the BBC’s director general and its CEO of News.Threatening legal action.His White House press secretary even tweetedthat “Everyone should watch GB News!”, as if the US government has a role in telling British people where to get their news.This disturbing escalation in the assault on theBBCshould be incredibly alarming to anyone who cares about truth, accountability and democracy. Trump and his mates are trying to destroy one of our most precious British institutions, and we must act fast to stop them.Of course, the BBC is not perfect. How could it be? I’ve had my share of disagreements and frustrations with it in recent years – not least when it comes to the amount of airtime it gives Farage, without properly scrutinising his record on immigration, the economy or the rest of the damage he’s done to our country. And the Panorama documentary at the centre of the latest controversy clearly got it wrong. As the BBC has now admitted, the way Trump’s speech was edited was an error of judgment and it’s right the BBC has apologised.But come on. Trump complaining about words being taken out of context? Worried that people might be misled? Give me a break. Trump has crippled America’s public broadcasters with funding cuts, banned journalists from the Pentagon, andbrought a $10bn lawsuitagainst the Wall Street Journal. Let’s be clear – Trump and his friends are not brave crusaders fighting for journalistic integrity and factual reporting. They are seizing on a single mistake by one BBC programme as an excuse to undermine the whole organisation. We simply cannot let that happen.The BBC is a little like a wayward family member. I don’t always like what it does, but I will always love it. And I will always treasure it. To save the BBC, we have to make sure it remains focused on its original mission: to inform, educate and entertain. It must not be coerced into doing Trump’s bidding, or bullied into giving undue prominence to the loudest, most divisive voices. The BBC’s strength lies in its independence and impartiality. That has been eroded, not least by Conservative politicians when they were in government. It is critical that we now repair it, to ensure it is properly independent and strong enough to stand up to political pressure, whether foreign or domestic.Fortunately, Johnson’s pick for BBC chair, Sharp, is already gone –he resignedtwo years ago over his links to a secret loan of up to£800,000 to … guess who? Boris Johnson. But Gibb is still there, as a member of the board that will choose the next director general of the BBC – a hugely important decision at this critical moment.Not only was Gibb the director of communications for Conservative prime minister Theresa May, and editorial adviser at GB News before being appointed by Johnson. He has alsobeen accusedofinterfering with editorial decisionsin a way that is totally unacceptable for a member of the board.To ensure the BBC’s independence, impartiality and trust, Gibb should have no role in appointing the new director general. The government should remove him from the board immediately – and end the practice of political appointments, which so badly undermines the BBC, altogether.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For my Unrwa colleagues on the ground in Gaza, the constant fear of being killed by bombs and guns may have abated, but there is still much to worry about – access to shelter, food and clean water remains challenging, and winter is approaching fast.There is no time to lose in tackling widespreadhungeranddisease. The scale ofphysicalandpsychological traumais immense, and expectations about access to healthcare and education are growing. The next weeks and months will determine whether this watershed moment will lead to a new dawn or be a prelude to greater despair.The UN, including Unrwa, has the expertise and the resources to address critical humanitarian needs effectively and at scale. But we must be allowed to work freely and independently, without arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions on the entry and movement of supplies and personnel.The path to recovery in Gaza will not be straightforward. The ceasefire is tenuous, withalmost daily breachestesting the resolve of its guarantors. A ceasefire that merely prolongs the absence of war without charting a viable path to peace would only repeat the disastrous mistakes of the past. A truly peaceful future requires a genuine investment in a definitive political solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict.Basic security is needed for recovery to take a firm hold. The ceasefire must be buttressed by an international stabilisation force mandated to maintain calm, protect critical infrastructure and guarantee humanitarian access. Such a force would create the necessary space for Palestinian institutions to be rebuilt.Gaza’s children needed a ceasefire – now they desperately need the aid that will keep them alive | Alison GriffinRead moreThe success of a stabilisation force, and the transition from emergency to stability, will also depend on providing Palestinians inGazawith reliable public services and a credible pathway to peace and respect for human rights. This can only be accomplished through a capable civil service that has the trust of the community.We have previously seen the consequences of underestimating the need to provide stable and effective public services – most strikingly in Iraq, when dismantling the civilian administration in 2003 created a governance vacuum that unleashed years of instability. Gaza’s professionals, administrators and community leaders must be part of the solution, not casualties of political resets.Unrwa, with its thousands of Palestinian personnel, has the capacity, expertise and community trust required to provide healthcare, education and other public services to a devastated population. For decades, the agency’s teachers, doctors and engineers have formed a vital part of a functioning system of public services for millions of Palestinian refugees in Gaza and the region.Inits advisory opinion last month, the international court of justice reaffirmed the professionalism of Unrwa’s staff, underlined the agency’s indispensable humanitarian role and concluded that Unrwa remains an impartial and neutral actor.Unrwa’s education services, including a well-regarded human rights programme, will be key to preventing the emergence of radicalism nurtured by the brutal siege on Gaza and the atrocities inflicted during the past two years. Nearly 700,000 children of school age are now living in the rubble, dispossessed not only of homes and loved ones, but also of education. Getting those children back into schools will be key to securing peace and stability for Gaza and the broader region.Beyond humanitarian relief efforts and the resumption of public services, businesses and donors must be able to trust that peace will last, and that reconstruction efforts are not in vain.The people of Gaza need the promise of a normal life, with permanent housing and functioning hospitals and schools. Rebuilding Gaza means restoring governance, justice and the broadly held conviction that peace is still possible within the parameters of a two-state solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Today, Israelis and Palestinians are neighbours who no longer know each other, divided by war, growing isolation and mistrust. It is both tragic and ironic, because they share a long and profound history of oppression, grief and loss that most of us could not begin to imagine or understand.Reconnecting Palestinians and Israelis requires deconstructing the systematic dehumanisation that has enabled unconscionable atrocities. It requires acknowledging the decades-long oppression of Palestinians and the deep collective trauma triggered by the attacks of 7 October 2023 within Israel.To achieve a lasting peace, justice needs to be delivered, and healing seriously addressed by both Palestinian and Israeli societies.Philippe Lazzarini is commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (Unrwa)Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s a double-edged swordTayo BeroIt’s great the taboo is fading. But as TikTok influencers tout them, it’s a slippery slope to the memeification of disordersMon 10 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 08.42 ESTShareAntidepressants areall the ragenow, so much so that influencers are promoting them on TikTok, where mostly millennial and gen Z women have built micro-communities around hashtags like #lexaprotok, #zoloftgang and #livelaughlexapro.According to data analyzed by theWall Street Journal, content related to antidepressants has recently exploded. The hashtag #antidepressants has surpassed 1.3bn views, according to the data, and searches for #lexapro have more than tripled since 2022. The data also showed that user shares per video tagged #ssri nearly quadrupled from 2022 to 2025.As a Black woman who has been taking antidepressants for years, I’m glad that we’re continuing to demystify and destigmatize mental illness. But it’s a slippery slope from that to the memeification of very serious disorders, and drug companies are not doing enough to find a healthy, responsible middle ground.While it’s still taboo to speak about mental illness in many communities, and being medicated for it continues to be stigmatized, the discourse in the west has definitely shifted. But on their journey from awkward topic to wellness trend, antidepressants are having to pass through the social media meat grinder and the result is that we’ve swung too far in the other direction, launching young women in particular into very dangerous territory where their health is concerned. Non-medical professionals touting the benefits of medications that their followers can easily get? What could go wrong?Well, lots of things, many of them rooted in the ethical gray area that “patient influencers” inhabit. These influencers have been around for a few years, promoting drugs to trusting followers; sometimes they have close links to drugmakers,a 2023 study found. Patient influencers of all kinds offer medical advice to their followers – that’s bad enough – and a researcher behind the 2023 study says some have done sowithout revealingtheir ties to the very drug companies they are promoting.According to the Wall Street Journal’s analysis, influencers touting antidepressants for pay generally use hashtags such as #ad to disclose their relationships to companies they highlight. But patient influencers may gloss over side-effects – which is particularly concerning when telehealth is making antidepressants easier to acquire than ever. (A telehealth company that pays influencers to advertise onTikToktold the Journal it was “proud that these efforts have helped people connect with qualified clinicians and get the care they need”.)This marketing trend isn’t surprising: the American healthcare system is carnivorously profit-driven, after all. The US remains one of two countries in the world that allows pharmaceutical companies to make direct-to-consumer advertising for prescription drugs, and big pharma is pumpingbillionsof dollars into those ads every year. Combine that with the reality thatanxiety and depression rates have climbedamong young people in recent years, and the monthly rate of antidepressants dispensed to young people rose 66% from January 2016 to December 2022, according to a study publishedin the journal Pediatrics, and it’s the perfect storm.Antidepressant use can be messy, stressful, confusing and seemingly interminable (don’t even get me started on my experience with withdrawal symptoms). It is not the kind of experience that vulnerable young people should be socially coerced into, especially via the machinations of capitalist vultures. Young people need way more than a two-minute TikTok to figure out what they should do to get better. And while it is crucial for mental health services to be far more accessible, handling the treatment process like a QVC ad is undeniably irresponsible.Tayo Bero is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryOpinionMental healthTikTokDrugscommentShareReuse this content"

But with his blustering, often brutish behavior toward other countries,Donald Trumphas rapidly revived that notion. Under Trump, the Ugly American is back.Trump has done this by using US power in aggressive and arrogant ways – by attacking other countries’ policies and then threatening to punish them if they don’t bow to his demands. Trump is doing exactly what international lawsays national leaders shouldn’t be doing. He has repeatedly inserted himself into other countries’ affairs, browbeating their leaders, berating their policies and disrespecting their sovereignty. Too often, Trump treats other countries as vassals of the US (and of his ego).The phrase “the Ugly American” was popularized bya 1958 novel with that title; it described the insensitivity and ineptness of US diplomats who often didn’t speak the language where they were stationed and rarely spoke to the people there. Over the years, that term was increasingly used to describe insensitive and arrogant US tourists and insensitive and arrogant US policies toward other nations.Trump has acted like an Ugly American in many ways. He has interfered in Brazil’s internal affairs by all but ordering it to drop the prosecution of its rightwing former president (and Trump buddy) Jair Bolsonaro for conspiring to stage a coup to return to power. When Brazil didn’t drop the prosecution – Bolsonaro wasconvicted and sentenced to 27 yearsin prison – Trump imposed a50% tariffon Brazilian goods.Flattery will get you everywhere: Orbán lays it on thick with TrumpRead moreIn recent weeks, Trump has played the Ugly, even Crazed, American toward Canada when he grew outraged after seeing a television ad, sponsored by the province of Ontario, that contained excerpts of a Ronald Reagan speech critical of tariffs. In retaliation, Trump imposed anadditional 10% tariff on Canadian goods. That move further angered Canadians who were already furious about Trump’s absurd idea tomake Canada the 51st state.Trump has also sought to bully Colombia. He said the US wouldcut off aid to that countryafter its president, Gustavo Petro, complained that the US had struck a Colombian fishing boat and killed a fisher as part of Trump’s campaign of attacking boats allegedly transporting drugs. Using ugly, undiplomatic language, Trump called Colombia’s president an“illegal drug leader”.Simultaneously come Trump’son-again, off-again threatsto launch military strikes against Venezuela. They are a reminder of Washington’s baldly imperialistic interventions in, among other places, Vietnam, Grenada and Iran, withthe 1953 coupousting a leftist prime minister. Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, is corrupt, repressive and authoritarian, andstole an election, but military intervention would be a throwback to the worst days of Ugly Americanism.Trump has also interfered in the European Union’s affairs. In an era when social media is overflowing with so many untruths that it makes it hard for democratic governments to function, even survive, the European Union has understandablyrequired social media platforms to weed out liesand other disinformation. But Trump has lambasted the EU’s Digital Services Act, asserting that itdiscriminates against US tech companies. His administration has angered the EU by threatening toimpose new tariffsandrestrict the visasof some EU officials.Trump’s Ugly American policies have done grievous damage to Washington’s image abroadTrump has improperly interfered in Argentina’s politics by saying he would grant a $40bn bailout, but might pull that money if the party of Argentina’s rightwing president, Javier Milei, didn’t winlegislative elections on 26 October. “If he loses, we arenot going to be generous with Argentina,” Trump said. Milei’s party won,with an interventionist Trump taking some credit, saying: “He had a lot of help from us.”Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, interfered in German politics by attacking mainstream parties forbuilding a “firewall” against letting far-right partiessuch as the AfD into a governing coalition. In a speech last month to Israel’s Knesset, Trump interfered in that country’s politics in an extraordinary way, calling onIsrael’s president to pardon the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on the corruption charges he’s facing.In Trump’s hour-long tirade to the UN general assembly in September, he sought to play Boss of the World. He told the UN’s 193 member nations to jettison their climate change policies, saying concerns about global warming were“the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”. He added: “If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail and I’m really good at predicting things.” Trump told the assembled diplomats they should sharply curb immigration, and in an ugly slap in the face, he said:“Your countries are going to hell.”Even as many UN delegates grimaced, Trump said: “On the world stage,America is respected againlike it has never been respected before.” Donald Trump can dream, but Ishaan Tharoor, a global affairs columnist for the Washington Post, wrote on X that a senior foreign diplomat had told him: “This man is stark, raving mad. Do Americans not see how embarrassing this is?”Trump’s Ugly American policies have done grievous damage to Washington’s image abroad. Foreigners’ favorability ratings of the USplummetedin a Pew poll, and51% of Europeans see Trump as an enemy of Europe, according to a Le Grand Continent/Cluster 17 survey. In a diplomatic loss to the US,Vietnam is embracing Russiaasa partnerbecause its leaders are so upset with Trump’s tariffs and other policies.

Slamming the door on refugees, he has slashed annual quotasfrom 125,000 to 7,500. He is overwhelmingly rejecting those fleeing persecution and war, yearning to breathe free, while favoring white Afrikaners from South Africa.Amnesty Internationalsaid that “Trump’s racist refugee cap abandons refugees around the world”, while Human Rights First called the new policy “blatantly racist”.Trump has become the 800lb gorilla of world affairs, throwing around Washington’s extraordinary weight in ways that injure and infuriate other countries – by imposing tariffs willy-nilly, by blowing up boats in the Caribbean, by berating other countries’ policies and leaders. Trump hasn’t earned other countries’ respect so much as their fear and ire. Much of the world is alarmed about what the swaggering gorilla will do next, and much of the world questions the gorilla’s judgment. Why is he sabotaging the global economy with his tariff mania? Why has he embraced Vladimir Putin for so long? Why has he railed against anyone and everyone trying to fight global warming?One must admit that even with his Ugly American tendencies, Trump sometimes does the right thing, but often belatedly. He finallyput pressure on Netanyahuto agree to a ceasefire. He finallyimposed some meaningful sanctionson Russia (although his support of beleaguered Ukraine remains far too tepid).Unfortunately, it’s not easy for other countries to stand up to Trump’s bullying. It’s difficult to resist when the leader of the world’s most powerful nation is so uninhibited about wielding his power. But we’ve seen mighty China stand up to Trump on tariffs, whileBrazil’s president rebuffedTrump’s demand to drop charges against Bolsonaro. Even tiny Denmark has stood up to Trump’s imperialistic demands on Greenland.Let’s hope that more countries stand up to Trump’s wrong-headed, bullying diplomacy. And let’s hope that many more Americans, including the cowed members of Congress, stand up to Trump when they see how colossally harmful his Ugly American policies are.There’s no denying that Trump’s Ugly Americanism will leave the US and the world worse off. His tariffs have slowed global economic growth and increased tensions with dozens of countries. America’s allies have grown increasingly angry and distrustful and will be less willing to cooperate with the US. With Trump smashing so many diplomatic norms, Russia and China are feeling freer to act as they wish. And Trump’s cozying up to autocrats while showing coolness toward human rights activists will hold back democracy movements worldwide.It’s ugly stuff.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labor and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS foreign policyUS immigrationJD VanceEuropean UnionEuropeBrazilcommentShareReuse this content"

So large is the vacuum on the left of politics that his victory will occupy an outsized space for progressives beyond New York City. And so, before I lay too much on his head myself, some caveats. New York is a specific place. It has a specific demographic and economic profile. And Mamdani is a man of a specific background, racial, political and religious. But with that out of the way, I think the successful practice of “identity politics” during his campaign offers some universal lessons.I put identity politics in quote marks because the term now means little that is universally agreed upon. Broadly, it has come to mean something derogatory, kind of in the same way that “wokeness” has. It increasingly has negative connotations: a political appeal to race or other markers of identity that is shallow, rooted in perpetual victimhood, focused only on representation and disconnected from material reality. Seen this way, identity politics is not about universal goals, such as lifting people out of poverty and so mobilising broad coalitions of voters, but simply about visibility.But identity politics as an organising political force has its origins in precisely the opposite idea. Coined by the Black feminist socialist organisation theCombahee River Collectivein 1977, identity politics was defined as a path to a liberation that could only come about through the understanding that systems oppress many different people along the lines of their identity, and so could only be dismantled if all groups worked together. “We believe,” the collective declared, “that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity”, but that “we also often find it difficult to separate race from class from sex oppression because in our lives they are most often experienced simultaneously.”That “simultaneous experience” is what I am talking about here. Mamdani tapped into that. He rooted his campaign solidly in the experience of being a New Yorker, and how the city needed to be made more affordable, then expanded that to include all the ways in which different groups live that experience. He released campaigning videos in Urdu, Hindi, Spanish and Arabic, and consistently made all of them about a retail economic message: rent freezes, free buses, universal childcare, makingNew Yorka place to raise your children and build small businesses. Then he threw in a bespoke little twist. In his Arabic message he quipped that something more controversial than his political message is his belief that the knafeh, an Arab dessert, is better on Steinway Street in Queens than it is in New Jersey. Talk about hitting a sweet spot.Including the languages of underrepresented identities is an exercise in enfranchisement. He quoted the Arabic phraseanaminkum wa alaikum– “I am of you and for you” – in hisvictory speech, and named those “forgotten by the politics of our city”, the “Yemeni bodega owners and Mexican abuelas. Senegalese taxi drivers and Uzbek nurses. Trinidadian line cooks and Ethiopian aunties”.He combined that with being in the places that working-class people, many of whom are people of colour, occupy. Visiting those on thetaxi ranksand working the late-night shifts, he forged a powerful metaphor of a city that is kept going by those who labour in the dark. And he drew that all together by bringing his own identity, as he himself put it, “into the light”. A Muslim who grew up in the shadows of Islamophobia, he suffered an outrageously racist campaign against him, but resisted the pressure to play down his identity in order to fit in, to succeed. “No longer will I live in the shadows,”he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The coalition that Mamdani built, across all ethnicities, became about closing the yawning gap between people and power. In a revealing contrast to establishment Democrat politicians, when Mamdani was heckled last week over his position on Gaza, he did not say, as Kamala Harris did when she was heckled, “I’m speaking”. Mamdanismiled and said: “I want you to be able to afford this city too, my brother.”But there is something else about Mamdani’s approach that reveals how identity done right is generative. His is a politics that is forged and defined by being on the margins, but not as a single individual who wants to escape alone. Those who see their identity as a way to become part of an establishment that can then hold them up as exemplars of inclusive politics will always have limited appeal, and therefore limited success as changemakers. To see those margins, racial, economic and political, as spaces in which a majority can be mobilised, as spaces where people don’t want to hear about victimhood but justice, is to create coalitions and escape together. It is to reveal to the voting public that the problem is not particular racisms or prejudices, but an entire system that excludes all those who don’t have capital in all its forms.That message resonates with the college-educated white parents who are struggling with childcare costs, as well as the immigrant taxi driver struggling to pay rent. But above all, ironically, Mamdani exemplified the virtues of the American “melting pot”, a nation of immigrants at the sharp end of capitalism who together increasingly recognise all the ways in which the country is failing to live up to its ideals. All the ways in which Mamdani has been fought, not only by the right but by his own party, prove that American liberal politics has long lost its way in its service to capital and its preening approach to identity. What works in New York doesn’t necessarily map perfectly on to the rest of the US and beyond, but Mamdani’s win is a reminder that the people, whatever their identities, all want one thing – leaders who are of them, and for them.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniOpinionUS politicsDemocratsNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

Fifty years on from the dismissal, his values could still guide Australian politicsPeter LewisAlbanese would do well to look to Gough as he navigates one of the biggest technological challenges since the 1970sMon 10 Nov 2025 18.36 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 20.21 ESTShareI’m too young to have been an eyewitness to the dismissal, but the memory of Dad coming home from Trades Hall pissed off and two parts shot and telling nine-year-old me to watch the telly because “this is important” was my introduction to politics.In the lead-up toTuesday’s 50th anniversaryof our bloodless coup, I’ve been immersing myself in footage from that day, reflecting on what the great man would have made of the current government that carries his flame.Whitlam’s removal after less than three years in office by the crown (amid suspicion of deeper US involvement which persists to this day) has shaped Labor in two contradictory ways: the resilience of his ambition and the danger inherent in pursuing such grandeur.Gough Whitlam’s dismissal ‘a calculated plot’ to remove elected government via partisan ambush, PM saysRead moreIt would be unfair to say the Hawke-Keating government that followed eight years later lacked vision; their economic reforms were bold albeit aligned to the dominant force of neoliberal globalisation, tempered by a self-moderation born of the perceived overreach of the Whitlam project.After the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments imploded with Whitlamesque drama, it’s tempting to see the Albanese government as an inheritor of the Hawke-Keating mantle. Indeed, this year’s election cast Labor as the party of stability in a time of global chaos.But there are also echoes of Whitlam that reverberate deep in this government’s DNA, anchored by a prime minister who served his apprenticeship toTom Uren, another larger-than-life figure who survived the Thai-Burma railway to become a key minister under Gough.The Medicare card that was Albo’s constant companion through the election campaign has a living through-line to Whitlam, who created the universal health system that is so central to our national identity and the envy of much of the world.The majority women in the Albanese government may stand in stark contrast to paucity of women in Whitlam’s (there wasn’t a single elected woman until 1974), but his recognition via equal pay and no-fault divorce, modelled through his partnership with the formidable Margaret, are the genesis of that cultural shift.I’ve been thinking about Whitlam as I observe the current government’s struggle to navigate what could be the most consequential technological challenge since the 1970s: the rapid diffusion of artificial intelligence.The latestGuardian Essential Reportreinforces that this change is happening fast, with particularly younger Australians integrating AI into their work, their broader lives and even their relationships.How this technology may (or may not) be regulated is currently an open question, with industry and tech boosters pushing for a hands-off approach, while unions, advocates and the broader public seek a morerules-based framework.Given his career predated the Commodore 64, I’m not expecting Gough to give much guidance when it comes to the actual design of AI policy, but I do think the broader approach to such a big challenge could be informed by some Whitlamite values.We can start with Gough’s assertion of Australia’s independence embedded in his recognition of China and scepticism of US imperialism (how he would view Aukus is another hypothetical which we don’t have space to pursue here).In echoes of that cold war environment, US tech companies are driving the current acceleration doctrine, framing it as a race with China for which any regulatory restraint is an unnecessary handicap.But much like the post-Vietnam environment, this is creating a false binary. Indeed, there are elements of the China approach in terms of scale and control of the AI models that are more sustainable and conducive to global cooperation.Whitlam would also have come at the issue as a humanist rather than simply an economist. He would have eschewed the industry’sdubious modelling on productivityand he would have balanced that by a critical analysis of its impact on our national identity.As a leader of the cultural renaissance, Gough would have chafed against AI’s theft of material to train its models to repurpose and replicate the work of artists, musicians and writers.Australian culture, resources and democracy for $4,300 a year? Thanks for the offer, tech bros, but no thanks | Peter LewisRead moreWhile the Albanese governmenthas rejected the industry’s push to override copyright law to mine creative work, there are still unanswered questions on the ongoing damage of these crimes that need to be reconciled.Finally, Whitlam would see Australia not as a taker of other nations’ technology but as a shaper – to quote his government’s1974 white paper– “guided along paths coincident with the needs, aspirations and attitudes of an informed and expectant society”.Just as he imagined energy self-sufficiency, I suspect Whitlam would champion indigenous AI models that serve purposes other than the maximisation of shares price built on the erasure of jobs and culture.I’m not pretending that history has all the answers to the technological tsunami we face (and anyone who does is probably using Chat GPT), but I do know that to get the right answers we need to make sure we ask the right questions.Fifty years on, Gough offers a way to frame these questions around his assertion of an independent nation, confident of its place in the world, determined to project its unique voice in the service of Australians.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

The BBC’s enemies have taken two scalps and inflicted maximum damage. The shock resignation of the director general, Tim Davie, and the head of news, Deborah Turness, make it look as if the BBC accepts that it does indeed suffer from“serious and systemic” biasin its coverage of issues including Donald Trump, Gaza and trans rights. But in this political coup, only the BBC’s sworn ideological foes think a cherrypicked sample of journalistic errors amounts to “systemic” bias.It was indeed a bad mistake to splice together two bits of Trump’s speech; but it needed a quick apology, not a decapitation. The BBC’s chair,Samir Shah, I’m told, tried to persuade Davieto stay to avoid this apparent capitulation to critics: Davie should indeed have stood his ground, not weakened the BBC by walking away.How right Nick Robinson was on Saturday’s Today programme: “There is also a political campaign by people who want to destroy the organisation that you are currently listening to,” backed up by the veteran broadcaster John Simpson, who said Robinson was “exactly right”. Many more need to speak up everywhere. Boris Johnson said he’d stop paying the licence fee until the BBC grovelled. Bravo again for Robinson’sretaliatory tweet: “Hands up all those who think Boris Johnson is well placed to lecture anyone else on upholding standards & admitting mistakes.” (Attackers calling the BBC a bunch of lefties should remember Robinson is a former chair of the Young Conservatives.)The plotters are in a strong position to wreck from within. Robbie Gibb, a self-described “proper Thatcherite Conservative”, was appointed to the BBC board by Johnson’s government in 2021 and, according to evenBBC News, is seen as a driving critical force within the institution. As for impartiality, as Alan Rusbridgerwrites in Prospect, Gibb “led the mystery consortium to buy the Jewish Chronicle on behalf of a secret backer whose identity has never been revealed. His stewardship of that paper saw it mired in a number of its own ethical and editorial failings”. He was Theresa May’s director of communications and helped bring in as BBC standards adviser Michael Prescott (the two are reportedly friends), who authored the dossier behind the current scandal. Astonishingly, Gibb is also one of those who set up GB News, the platform that wasfined £100,000last year for breaking due impartiality rules.BBC chair apologises for Trump speech edit but defends corporation against bias claimsRead moreThe truth is no one agonises and self-examines like the BBC. Itseditorial guidelines, all 436 pages of them, are the nearest journalism has to a holy bible on impartiality and good judgment. The BBC, abiding as best it can by that text, amounts to our national arbiter of news. Its specialist analysts offer the most expert judgments most people will ever access, such as Jeremy Bowen’s dispatches on the Middle East or Sarah Smith from Washington DC.It bears a near-impossible burden. The BBC will fail frequently in its thousands of hours of output across the world. Large numbers of people (myself included) will often shout at their television sets, gnashing teeth at choices made by the BBC newsroom. Those journalists are fallible, subjected to a cat’s cradle of conflicting pressures to “inform, educate and entertain” while subjected to political, social and religious lobbying. Yet the BBC remains by miles the most watched, listened to and read of all platforms in the UK.It is the most trusted, at 60%, with the FT at 57%, ITV and Channel 4 at 56%, followed by the Guardian at 51% – according to the Reuters Institute. (Telegraph trust stands at 42%, the Mail at 24%.) Having spent seven years in a BBC newsroom, I saw how the attempt to walk the line of balance consumes everyone there.As the Telegraph gloats at bringing the BBC low – the BBC plunged into existential crisis,“The future of the BBC is now in doubt”– consider its own contribution to rational political debate. The Sunday Telegraph editor,Allister Heath, regularly pens columns that inhabit a zone planets away from what was once reasonable conservative discourse. Some recent headlines of his: “The awful truth about the BBC is now too monstrous to hide”; “Starmer’s monstrous tax lies will trigger a revolt of Middle England”; “Starmer has declared war on Western values”. We also shouldn’t forget the commercial incentives behind BBC attacks; profit-seeking news organisations, from Lord Rothermere’s group to Rupert Murdoch’s, have plenty of reasons to relentlessly savage the BBC and its market share.The next person brave or foolhardy enough to take on the mantle ofBBCdirector general will face yet fiercer warfare. Tasting blood, the right will redouble its efforts to destroy the organisation for good. Nigel Farage (38 BBC Question Time appearances and counting) is committed to abolishing the licence fee and now speaks of it being “slimmed down”. The Tories compete, with Kemi Badenoch pleased her “heads should roll” line has been delivered. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, often well ahead of Labour, denounces a “strategy by the hard right to replace the truth with propaganda”.The BBC shouldn’t need defending when 12 million people watched the Celebrity Traitors final live, when Strictly, Blue Lights and a host of other triumphs defy better funded streamers, whenmore than 90% of peopleuse a BBC service every month, 74% every week. No other broadcaster would puthalf its jobs and producersoutside London. Though suffering30% cuts in the Tory years, the BBC has been ingenious. But this is no time for cutting the World Service that carries the UK’s voice, values and influence to 453 million people weekly worldwide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The right has a long agenda of national treasures that it wants to trash (it even tried tocrush the National Trust). Its patriotism is highly selective and phenomenally perverse, its targets often running against the grain of public opinion. But here’s a warning: leaving the European Union in the early Ukip days was also a minority obsession.The BBC is always in the right’s firing line, with the unpopular licence fee a useful weapon. That makes it crucial for the forthcoming review of its charter to find fairer alternatives to this poll tax. It should be adapted to people’s means but not left unprotected to general taxation, where the BBC would sink under other budget priorities. Its enemies hate the BBC with the same venom they detest the NHS, as publicly owned and popular social endeavours. Can the institution survive?

That takes more than just a minutePaul DaleyRemembrance is a conscious act – political, cultural and personal. Today it is worth reflecting on who and what we commemorate, and what we choose to omitMon 10 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 17.57 ESTShareThe first to publicly commemorate the people who fight wars are always those who send them to die.So it will be again today, the anniversary of the end of the first world war, when the politicians eulogise the countless people who’ve died horribly on battlefields, the oceans and in the skies.But for all of the solemn words that will leave the mouths of politicians and military leaders in Australia and elsewhere this Remembrance Day, the undeniable fact remains that the political-military class has drawn no lessons – beyond the strategic and tactical – from the millions who’ve died as combatants and civilians since the Great War ended on this day in 1918.There is a profound commemorative dissonance between the way our leaders regretfully evoke the “fallen” (time to just call them “the dead”, surely) of past conflicts and their passive political bystander-like responses to the mass war-slaughter of mainly non-combatants elsewhere – not least currently in the Middle East, Africa and eastern Europe.Here in Australia our pre- and post-federation martial history has involved a metronomic pattern oftrailing powerful empiresinto distant conflicts. And yet Australia still ties itself militarily and strategically to the most unpredictable and erratic United States administration in history through the$368bn Aukusdeal. Were Australia ever to receive the material benefit of all that money in the form of actual submarines (doubtful), Aukus would by nature expose Australia and its personnel toincreased dangerdue to greater interoperability with and reliance on the US navy.At a time when the US is sliding ever more steadily towards autocracy, its democratic institutions steadily eroded by the Trump administration, Australia is shackling itself to a blank-cheque military and diplomatic future of potential US combat entanglement. And it’s the men and women in uniform – and the legions of innocent civilians – who, once again, will pay the highest price.A bipartisan major-party protection racket ofAukusstifles meaningful internal political debate about the dire implications for Australian sovereignty of automatically being drawn, come what may, into America’s next major conflagration.About103,000 Australians have diedin various wars, peace-keeping and -making conflicts. This number, however, speaks to just a fraction of the human cost of Australia’s entanglement in the wars of others – a price that we as a nation have never been especially good at parsing.Themost storiedof Australian conflicts remains the first world war in which 416,000 Australian men (half of those eligible) enlisted from a population of barely 5 million. Just over 331,000 were deployed; 60,000-plus were killed. The most staggering figure has always seemed to me the 155,000 physically wounded and the countless others who returned psychologically and emotionally damaged.Drug and alcohol addiction was rife among veterans. Families were often subject to terrible domestic violence.And yet 107 years after the Great War’s armistice, amid all of that conflict’s bequeathed social impact and division on the fledgling Australian federation, this country still treats too many of its veterans and serving personnel with – as I’ve written before –“perversely shabby contempt”.Witness the recentroyal commission into defence and veteran suicide, the continuing political tardiness in response to it and the appalling treatment of its“key witness”.While secularism is growing in Australia, Anzac commemorations remain fervently Christian | Paul DaleyRead moreToday with a minute’s silence it is apt to respectfully reflect on the plight of those who fight and die in war. But it also seems reasonable to ask if we have come to nationally sentimentalise the horrific battlefield suffering of those who died long ago at the expense of the living – the enduring – veterans whose suffering is too often overlooked.Remembrance is a conscious act – political, cultural and personal. It involves choices about who and what to commemorate and celebrate, and what to omit.Australia has, since former prime minister Billy Hughes, tied its national identity tightly to military adventurism (and in the case of Hughes, dually to racial purity). But such national identification comes at the exclusion of so many other important narratives. Among them the contribution of women and migrants, and the country’s precocious democratic advancements including women’s suffrage and workers’ rights. Also overlooked – deliberately forgotten – is federation’s bedrock ofracial discriminationand its twin, Indigenous dispossession, whose profound generational legacies reverberate today.Not least, of course, there are the other wars that have been semi-officially deemed to have little or no official place when it comes to the acknowledgment of national genesis. These are the continental-wide frontier conflicts between British and Australian raised military forces and Aboriginal resistance fighters.I’ve been writing about this for along time.But political acknowledgment of the frontier wars and their importance to the establishment of the new white federation (on the stolen lands of the violently dispossessed) pitifully lags behind historical and cultural recognition.The Australian War Memorial, where so much of today’s political remembrance will play out, has been glacially slow to acknowledge the seminal importance of frontier war to national and military experience.But then again it is constantly making retrograde choices on what to – and what not to – highlight when it comes toAustralian militaryoperations.No better recent case in point can be found than the memorial’s obfuscation over its prestigiousmilitary history writing prize. Judges originally determined that journalist Chris Masters should win for his book on the alleged war crimes of Ben Roberts-Smith – a war hero, his reputation now tarnished after a lengthy defamation trial, who has long been celebrated by the AWM.Masters was ultimatelydeniedthe prize for a book chronicling deeply unpalatable truths about Australian military personnel and war that is starkly at odds with the memorial’s Anzac mythology.War and politics, truth-telling and commemorative dissonance – they all warrant private contemplation on this Remembrance Day. And that takes longer than a just a minute.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsAustralian militaryOpinionAukusFirst world warcommentShareReuse this content"

The vast majority have been supportive, while those who haven’t agreed with my politics have still been broadly respectful.While I was filming in Clacton, for instance, more than one of Nigel Farage’s constituentsstarted off disagreeing with me, but were open to changing their minds after talking through their concerns, and hearing more about the reality of Farage’s policies.That reception in the street differs dramatically from how my leadership has been met by parts of the media. In a democracy, I should expect a challenge. Indeed, I’m not one to shy away from debate. But the reaction has gone far beyond good-faith questioning of my policy positions, or analysis of what my party is offering.Instead, I’ve been the target of relentless nastiness – ranging from crass insults about my appearance in mainstream news outlets to the attempted ridicule of my politics by influential commentators. Of course, in being hounded by the media I am by no means unique. These attacks are often made on people with less power and privilege than me. How must it feel for members of the public who find themselves in the public eye and targeted by the tabloid media?The bombardment takes different forms – but in my case, it can be distilled into three categories: the legitimate examination of my past, the ludicrous attacks on my personal attributes, and the absurd kneejerk reaction toGreen partypolicies.What’s now clear to me, both from the sheer number of attacks and their increasingly wild nature, is that they are a product of a political and media establishment rattled by a party that’s growing fast and willing to say the unsayable: that our country has been hijacked by those interested only in serving the super-wealthy.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Daily MailSo let’s start with my past, which has come under intense scrutiny. First, there’s the Sun article about breast hypnosis. I knew when I stood for leader of the party that thiswould come up, and I understand why people would want an explanation.Long before being involved with the Green party, I agreed to do a piece on hypnosis and body image. The journalist asked for it to be a piece about breast enlargement. I asked for it to be clear that it was their suggestion, not mine, but I should have said no. I went out to clarify that on the radio the very next day. It’s embarrassing, but the desperation with which opponents are clinging to it has been pretty disproportionate. I don’t think there are many TV shows now where I haven’t explained that I was misrepresented in the article.The other thing that gets a lot of mentions is my previous membership of the Liberal Democrats. Again, this is fair to bring up – it’s about my political journey – and I am more than happy to explain that my politics have changed, and that the Green party became my political home because my strengthening belief in social and environmental justice led me to the only party that truly represents those values.But then, there are the personal insults. From Harriet Harmanweirdly calling me“macho” to Jeremy Clarkson’s rant in the Sunday Timesabout my teeth, and the Daily Mail’s Quentin Lettssuggesting that my looksmean I have “shades of Hannibal Lecter”, the attacks have been fairly consistent, and multiplied by a small army of very loud, very online trolls. Those same trolls are also obsessed with the fact that Ichanged my namewhen I was 18 – reclaiming my Jewish ancestry in the processMost striking, though, have been the wild and increasingly absurd misrepresentations of my politics. Just recently the Tory peer and radio host Daniel FinkelsteinclaimedI was “against wealth and growth” when I simply said to him that GDP is a terrible way to measure health and wellbeing. Then there was a Times leader saying that Green policies “hold grave dangers”, Piers Morgan’s franklyweird obsessionwith genitalia and commentator Carole Malone telling the Daily Express that I was a “dangerous man” because I want a public health-based approach to drugs. That doesn’t mean making all drugs freely available over the counter. It means taking out organised crime and the gangs, tightly regulating the market and supporting people who become dependent on drugs with medical interventions, not jail.It’s obvious to me why these attacks have become so ferocious: it’s because more and more people are backing a party with policies that will dismantle the economic consensus and focus relentlessly on the cost of living. Three-quarters of peoplesupport a wealth tax– yet none of the establishment parties will touch it. So parts of the media close ranks when the vast wealth of their owners and the policies of their friends in Westminster come under threat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From our plans to bring water into public ownership, to supporting rent controls and an end to the “war on drugs” – I follow the evidence from the UK’s failures, and examples from across the world of how to do things better. All too often, such plans aren’t met with fair scrutiny, which I would welcome, but with a sense that I’m presenting ideas from the radical fringes, and that they therefore don’t merit proper discussion.Nowhere is this more apparent than inmy viewson the genocide in Gaza and the actions of Israel. There is an utter disconnect between a journalistic class that nodded along to a boycott of Russian sport after the appalling invasion of Ukraine, while mounting franklyoutrageous attackson those of us who said that Israeli teams should be given the same treatment. This is evidence of a class of people who value independent thought far less than contacts in government. For me, as a Jewish man, to be repeatedly accused of being part of some sort of antisemitic movement is the most galling attack of all. It hasn’t gone unnoticed that across the Atlantic there’s another politician who has faced a whirlwind of abuse and attempted distraction but has maintained his relentless focus on raising people’s living standards.Zohran Mamdani’s victoryhas demonstrated the potential for a city – it’s time for us to do it for our entire country.When I was elected, I said I wanted the Green party to replace Labour as the progressive choice for people. I mean it. One poll in late Octoberput the us ahead of Labourfor the first time and suggested the Greenscould take the seatof Holborn and St Pancras from Keir Starmer. That’s what smashing the stale, old two-party politics and replacing Labour looks like.The bad news for those who attack me is that we simply won’t back down. They can sound off about my teeth all they want. But the more I see them panic about the replacement of the politics of hate with a politics of hope, the more we know our movement is on the right track.Zack Polanski is the leader of the Green partyExplore more on these topicsZack PolanskiOpinionGreen partycommentShareReuse this content"

And many more people face death without the care and support they needMon 10 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 13.59 ESTShareAbaby, in Britain, in 2025, takes its stuttering final breaths. All deaths in infancy are harrowing. But the fact that this particular death might have been prevented – had neonatal care not depended so heavily on charity, had theNHSnot failed to fund more than two-thirds of the healthcare babies need – is unforgivable.Mercifully, the dystopian healthcare scenario I’ve just described does not exist in the UK today. Although paediatric care is undeniably overstretched, it is at least regarded as a core, bedrock NHS service.We would never tolerate a government that chose to defund most neonatal services, gambling instead that charities would act to fill the gap. Yet this is exactly the situation faced by people needingend-of-life care. Remarkably, the famously “cradle to grave” NHS funds onlyabout 30%of hospice care in the UK. The shortfall is made up from charitable donations: the goodwill of local individuals and businesses stepping in where the state has chosen to walk away.As last month’s National Audit Office report demonstrated, thefinancial state of the hospice sectoris dire. Two-thirds of adult hospices in Englandrecorded a deficit in 2023-24. Across the country, hospices are being forced tocut staff, reduce their bed numbers and slash community services for dying people who wish to be cared for at home. The result is a postcode lottery of care in which your chances of receiving high-quality palliative care hinge on variables that include the level of deprivation where you live and the extent to which your local NHS management chooses to prioritise patients with terminal illnesses. A month ago, for example, Arthur Rank Hospice in Cambridgeshire revealed that Cambridge University Hospitals had elected to withdraw £829,000 of annual funding,forcing the hospice to close nine of its 21 beds. “Essentially, this now means that over 200 people a year will no longer have the option of being cared for in the comfort of our hospice and instead will sadly be dying in a busy hospital,” Arthur Rank’s CEO, Sharon Allen, stated. The NHS trust responded by saying that the hospice beds were “very poor value for money”.Why we must tackle the crisis in end-of-life care | LettersRead moreFor me, a hospital palliative care specialist, abstract funding statistics take on daily, indelible form. There is the face of the elderly veteran, curled like a comma on a trolley, who had hoped to end his days in a hospice, but was diverted to a crisis-stricken A&E instead. There is the family whose hopes I dash yet again when I say, “I’m so sorry, there are still no beds at the hospice.” There are soiled sheets, unvoiced fears, missed doses of morphine. The hard truth, in short, about underfunding palliative care is that people who are at their most vulnerable – the dying – suffer more pain, more indignity, less choice and less autonomy than they might have. It means that suffering at the end of life takes two forms: an inescapable part and an avoidable part, the latter being the product not of disease but of political choices.Why do we allow this? We are not a brutal nation. As individuals and collectively we are capable of startling acts of kindness and compassion. In 2022, we threw open our doors in our thousands to invite Ukrainians fleeing Russian troops into our homes. Two years before that, when the Covid pandemic took hold, our streets hummed with grassroots activism as we rallied to support elderly people and vulnerable neighbours. The BBC’s annual Children in Need appeal often raisesabout £50m. Some of us will choose to donate a kidney to a person we’ve never met before.For all the division and acts of self-interest and hate, Britain is decent and caring too. Most people, most of the time, try their flawed best to be good. So why, when it comes to caring for our dying, do we turn this collective blind eye?Death may be as inescapable as birth, as inevitable as gravity, yet it is also steeped in fear. Once a domestic, intimate affair – in Victorian England, for example, the vast majority of deaths happened at home –modern dying is a largely institutional phenomenon. In England today, less than a third of deaths take place at home, the rest occurring in hospitals, care homes or – a mere 5% of them – in hospices. The rhythms, stages and rituals of dying have become alien and unfamiliar. And we tend not to dwell on things that frighten us, opting instead to pretend that they may never happen.I sympathise with all of this. Two decades ago, I spent nights on-call as a hospital house officer who dreaded being summoned to the bedside of a patient in the on-site hospice. To me at that time, death felt otherworldly and dreadful. Yet dying is, of course, one of the only experiences that all of us, without exception, will share – as natural as it is necessary. For ourselves, our parents, our children, our friends. Forabout 580,000 of us every yearin England and Wales. That’s three or four more people who have taken their last breaths in the time you’ve taken to read this article.If we shy away from confronting our mortality, we run the risk of doing an immense, unintended disservice to those who are approaching the end of their lives. Closed hearts and closed minds cannot empathise. Our reluctance to imagine the deathbed constitutes a barrier between ourselves and the dying. It permits the avoidable suffering at the end of life that successive governments, both Conservative and Labour, perpetuate by failing to fund palliative care properly – a fact we should all be up in arms over.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not only is demand for palliative care projected toincrease by more than 25% by 2048, butKim Leadbeater’s assisted dying billis working its way through the House of Lords. On both sides of that fraught parliamentary debate, politicians have rightly been unanimous in their insistence that high-quality palliative care should be available to anyone considering assisted dying. Yet large numbers of people –about 150,000 of them a year– are already unable to access the palliative care they need. The increasingly indebted hospice sector simply cannot cope with demand. This raises a dystopian prospect all of its own – that people may feel compelled to accept assistance in dying because they cannot access the palliative care that might make life still worth living.These are matters of the utmost seriousness. Perhaps the worst thing, then, about the government’s response tolast week’s reportwas its glibness: “We recognise there is more to do, and we are exploring how we can improve the access, quality and sustainability of all-age palliative care and end of life care in line with the 10-year health plan.”I’ve read theNHS 10-Year Plan for Englandfrom cover to cover.

It is a crushing setback for democracy in one of the world’s most open societiesMon 10 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 03.22 ESTShareShortly after the first TV debate in the campaign for next year’s Swedish election, there was a startling announcement. Anna-Karin Hatt, the leader of the Centre party, the standard-bearer for liberal centrism in Swedish politics,announced her resignation, citing an unbearable number of threats and harassment.Hatt was an emerging voice in Swedish politics, but had been able to lead the Centre party for only five months before she made a speech announcing that she felt forced to leave her job for the safety of her family. Her speech was short on specifics, but she referred to clear physical threats “not just from trolls behind a screen, it has come much closer than that”. She said she felt obliged to look over her shoulder in public spaces and no longer felt safe in her own home.Hatt’s announcement came just three years after her popular predecessor,Annie Lööf, left the party leadershipfor the same reason: extremist hate, neo-Nazi threats, online trolls and offline stalkers. Lööf was about to deliver a speech at a political festival in Gotland in 2022 when another speaker at the event, a politically active psychiatrist, wasstabbed to death. The man convicted of her murder had planned to kill Lööf.In interviews at the time of her resignation, Lööf said that she felt huge relief at having got out of politics without being physically harmed. The way she talked about her experience of public life sounded less like politics in a healthy democracy than a panicked swim among sharks.Now, with yet another liberal woman prematurely departing Swedish politics, we need to be clear about what is happening here: women are being chased out of public life, by unconstrained hate groups, online trolls and far-right extremism. In one of the world’s strongest democracies, this is becoming the new normal.Hatt’s experience follows a global pattern, where vile men try to assert their power over women in public life by threatening to physically hurt or kill them. A loud minority of extremists are mobilised by an increasingly toxic and unregulated social media environment and the rise of authoritarian far-right parties.Despite the alarming nature of these threats, establishment conservatives in the Swedish government have mostly dismissed the concerns. Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, nonchalantly said thatHatt should have been more“thick skinned”. Most rightwing pundits echoed him, implying that Hatt was simply not up to the task, that the onus was on her to toughen up.If their logic is that death threats and stalkers have to be priced in if you want to participate in public life, then we are likely to see fewer people doing so. And those Swedes who are most likely to be the targets of attack: women, immigrants and minorities are the ones most likely to avoid seeking public office. This would be a crushing retreat for democracy in one of the world’s most open societies.After Hatt’s resignation, Lööf wrote a vividdescriptionof the kind of threats that had forced her to leave her job in 2022. “Death threats, empty bullet casings in my mailbox, Nazis outside my home, hate campaigns on social media, threats against my family. I have sat face to face with a man who planned to kill me – because of my values. A man who has been convicted of murder and terrorist crimes for preparing to commit murder. A man who began tracking me as early as 2013. These are the terrible downsides of public office.”Her refusal to form a government with a far-right party was the reason for the vile attacks, she claimed.Amandah Andersson, policy chief at the Centre party’s women’s organisation, Centerkvinnorna, tells me that Hatt “inherited” a part of the [online] environment that was directed at Lööf. “As a woman, there is a bigger risk of exposure to harsh threats and hatred,” she says.Much of the contempt for Hatt and the Centre party comes from far-right nationalists, who are upset about these politicians’ relatively liberal views on immigration. But it also comes from traditional conservatives, who are frustrated that the Centre party no longer wants to govern with the ruling Moderate party, which nowrelies on an alliancewith the far-right Sweden Democrats for a governing majority.Last year, an investigation by Swedish TV4revealedthat the Sweden Democrats were operating a vast network of troll farms to systematically harass and abuse political opponents, and spread false information.The Sweden Democrats own TV network,Riks,has consistently demonised the Centre party, and particularly Lööf. She was called “Sharia Annie” with “sociopath eyes”, for staying true to her defence of immigration. Riks has more than a million regular viewers in Sweden.Despite its reputation for safety and stability, Sweden has a recent history of brutal political violence. Prime ministerOlof Palme was murdered in 1986. In 2003, the foreign minister Anna Lindh, also a Social Democrat, wasmurdered in a department store in central Stockholm. In 2011, 77 young leftwing activists were murdered in afar-right massacre inUtøya, in neighbouring Norway, but several of the victims and survivors were Swedish. The attack left a huge scar on all Scandinavian politics, with immeasurably chilling effects for new generations of activists.Targeting women in politics with abuse is a global issue. Already in 2016, areportwhich looked at data in 39 countries, showed that psychological violence affected four in every five female parliamentarians. Sexually demeaning remarks affected 65% of those surveyed, “followed by threats of death, rape, beatings or abduction (44%)”, according to the report.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

From the attempted murder of the Democratic congresswomanGabrielle Giffords in Arizona, to a far-right terrorist plot againstMichigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, the attacks on the home ofNancy Pelosito the recent murder ofMinnesota Democrat Melissa Hortman.Similar patterns are emerging in European politics. In 2024, a report from theCouncil of European Municipalities and Regions(CEMR) showed that seven in 10 women in European politics had suffered abuse and harassment. In many countries, including Germany and Ireland, numbers were even higher.We should also consider how this is connected to the global far-right’s escalating attacks on DEI and diversity programmes, which are often less about affirmative action, than questioning the mere presence of women and people of colour as public officials in any public spaces.Of course it is possible to allay fears about extremism in Swedish politics by citing the country’s ranking as a stable democracy, its high levels of democratic participation and commitment to gender equality.But this is precisely why it’s so concerning that another prominent Swedish woman has been forced out. Even in one of the most stable democracies in the world, the threat of extremist violence is transforming political representation.Martin Gelin is a journalist and author.

Australia’s next national health funding deal is a chance to change thatPeter BreadonWith initial consults now costing hundreds of dollars, we must embrace a national plan to boost targeted training, cover gaps and curb excessive chargesSun 9 Nov 2025 19.13 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 00.16 ESTShareAreferral to a specialist doctor can be scary; you might be worried about getting a new diagnosis or hearing that your condition has gotten worse. But many Australians have an additional worry: whether they can afford the fee.Fees have surged, and they’re not slowing down. They’ve risen by 78% since 2010 on top of inflation. An initial consultation now often costs hundreds of dollars.Those fees mean a million Australians each year skip specialist care, risking delayed diagnoses, missed treatments and avoidable illness. Fees don’t just hit the rich; more than 70% of the poorest people who see a specialist pay a fee. It’s no wonder they’re less likely to go in the first place.To his credit, the federal health minister, Mark Butler, has said high fees are harming patients and things must change. He has taken a good first step by committing to publish information on the fees all specialists charge.Many GPs ‘nervous’ about bulk-billing rollout under new Medicare schemeRead moreHe could extend that reform by requiring that referral letters refer people to the fees website, remind them that they can use their referral to see any specialist and that they can ask for a costs estimate before they book.But better information alone won’t ensure everyone can get specialist care. Governments should also train more of the doctors we need, boost public services and rein in excessive fees.Today, the number of training places for specialists is largely determined by the needs of public hospitals and rules set by specialist colleges. That has helped lock in longstanding shortages. Some of the specialties that have been in short supply for decades have the lowest training numbers.Workforce planning is woeful – there are no targets for how many training places we need in each specialty. There are no targets for where those places should be, despite rural training being the best way to fix rural shortages.And the millions of dollars earmarked for training comes with no strings attached. Getting the workforce we need should start with governments setting national targets to train the right specialists in the right places and tying funding to meeting those targets.Training takes time. To fill gaps now, governments should invest in public clinics. When private providers aren’t there, the public system should fill the gap – but it rarely does. This leaves some communities missing out.Grattan Institute analysisshows some parts of Australia have a third less specialist appointments than others. Those holes in the safety net must be filled with targeted investment to expand public clinics.We recommend the federal and state governments should invest $470m to provide a million more free public visits in the parts of Australia with the least care.Governments should also directly tackle excessive fees charged by some private specialists. Unlike in some other countries, there is no limit on what specialists can charge patients. A small minority have clearly gone too far, charging average fees more than three times what the government pays them.That can mean close to $670 for a visit to a psychiatrist, or more than $360 for a visit to a paediatrician or cardiologist. One in five patients were charged an extreme fee at least once in 2023.There is no evidence that higher fees mean better care; extreme fees aren’t needed to fairly reward skill and experience. Less than 4% of specialists charge them, and average specialist incomes are already among the highest in the country.Patients should not need to put their health at risk while they shop around for a better deal. The federal government should protect them by setting a limit on the most extreme fees.These solutions have been neglected. Part of the reason is that the problem spans private and public clinics and federal and state policy: it’s everyone’s fault, so it’s been no one’s responsibility.But now there is a chance to act. Governments are now negotiating the next five-year national health funding deal. The agreement should include developing national training targets, tying funding to those targets, expanding public clinics and setting targets for public specialist waiting times.Some reforms don’t need to wait for the funding deal. There are changes that governments and specialist colleges can make right away like removing unnecessary training requirements, making it easier for specialists to migrate to Australia, regulating excessive fees and giving patients better information.But this is the moment for a big national plan that includes the essential steps of refocusing training and boosting public services. If governments miss this moment, the system will coast until the next deal in 2031, with training on autopilot, gaps in care and fees climbing ever higher.Peter Breadon is health program director at the Grattan InstituteExplore more on these topicsHealthOpinionDoctorsHospitalscommentShareReuse this content"

The judges “had never read anything quite like it”, said panel chair Roddy Doyle, who won the prize in 1993. “It is, in many ways, a dark book, but it is a joy to read.”Flesh opens with a shocking incident that unfolds while teenage István is living in an apartment complex with his mother in Hungary. Szalay then follows the protagonist as he spends time in the military before moving to London, where he begins working for the uber-rich. Written in spare prose, the novel explores masculinity, class, migration, trauma, sex and power.Flesh by David Szalay review – brilliantly spare portrait of a manRead moreSzalay was announced as the winner of the £50,000 award at a ceremony held in Old Billingsgate in London on Monday evening. He was previously shortlisted for the prize in 2016, for his novel All That Man Is.The decision to hand Szalay the award was “unanimous”, said Doyle. Joining him on this year’s panel was the actor Sarah Jessica Parker, along with the writers Chris Power, Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀ and Kiley Reid.The book “homes in on a working-class man, which ordinarily doesn’t get much of a look in”, said Doyle. “It presents us with a certain type of man” and “invites us to look behind the face.”“Without anybody being consciously aware of it, I was reared, for example, never to cry,” Doyle said. “I became aware of that and decided it was nonsense,” but István is “that type of man”.“Szalay has written a novel about the Big Question: about the numbing strangeness of being alive,” wrote Keiran Goddard in aGuardian reviewof the novel. “Stylistically, Flesh is all bone. Szalay has always been a master of the flinty, spare sentence but in this novel he has pared things back even more brutally.”Szalay’s novel topped a strong shortlist which includedbookies’ favouriteAndrew Miller, with The Land in Winter, and Kiran Desai, nominated for The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, her first novel since winning the Booker with The Inheritance of Loss in 2006. The other novels shortlisted this year were Susan Choi’s Flashlight, Katie Kitamura’s Audition, and Ben Markovits’s The Rest of Our Lives.Asked whether any of the other novels had got close to challenging Szalay’s win, Doyle said “the answer is ‘kinda yes’,” but refused to name specific titles, saying it would be “unfair, a bit cruel”.Born in Montreal to a Hungarian father and Canadian mother, Szalay grew up in London. He has lived in Lebanon and the UK, and now lives in Vienna. After graduating from Oxford, he worked as a financial advertising sales executive, which became the inspiration for his debut novel,London and the South-East. He is also the author of the novels Spring and The Innocent, as well as the short story collection Turbulence.Writer David Szalay: ‘We live in an era of short attention spans – we have to work with it the best we can’Read moreWritingin the Guardianover the weekend on his inspiration for Flesh, Szalay said that the novel was “conceived in the shadow of failure” – in autumn 2020 he abandoned a novel he had been working on for nearly four years that he felt wasn’t working. He wanted Flesh to “somehow express the feeling I had that our existence is a physical experience before it is anything else, that all of its other aspects proceed from that physicality”.His win marks the 10th for publisher Jonathan Cape, an imprint of Penguin, which has the most wins in the history of the prize.Last year’s winning title, Orbital by Samantha Harvey, was also published by Cape.Other recent winners include Prophet Song by Paul Lynch, The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka and The Promise by Damon Galgut.Flesh by David Szalay (Vintage Publishing, £18.99).

You couldn’t help but be inspired’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 10 Nov 2025 09.57 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 17.30 ESTShareRoland Gift, singer, songwriterI was in a band in Hull called Akrylykz. Whenthe Beatcame to play at the Welly club we gave them a demo tape. Then they invited us to tour with them. Later, after they split up, Andy Cox and David Steele were looking for a singer for a new band and they remembered me. Fine Young Cannibals felt right straight away. After The Tube filmed us doing Johnny Come Home, we just took off. Then somebody must have noticed me on telly because suddenly I was getting film offers, and I appeared inSammy and Rosie Get Laidand Scandal.But in my heart I didn’t really want to pursue acting. It felt like being a session musician – you do your bit, then you’re not really involved. So after the band did the soundtrack for the film Tin Men, we regrouped to do a second album. All sorts of names were mentioned as producers including, I think, Phil Collins. Instead, we ended up doing The Raw and the Cooked in a way people say you should never do an album: in lots of different studios with different producers.We did She Drives Me Crazy with David Z in Prince’s studio in Paisley Park, at which point we changed the title from She’s My Baby. I’d never sung falsetto before, but we were labelmates with Jimmy Somerville so he might have been an influence on the way I sing it. The way I elongate some of the words – “I can’t help mysel-el-elf” and so on – isn’t proper language but rules are there to be broken.She Drives Me Crazy went Top 5 in the UK and was the first of our two US No 1s, but it was bittersweet for me. When it was a hit I was reading Money by Martin Amis and my girlfriend chucked me, just like in the book. On the other hand, we’d always talked about wanting to make music that people would listen to many years later – which is exactly what happened.David Steele, bass, keyboards, drum machine, songwriterWe were playing about in the studio when we came up with what became the riff and beat to She Drives Me Crazy, although it was rockier at that point. None of us really liked it and it went into the box of unfinished songs. Good Thing was set to be our “big single” but then London Records wanted us to work with other producers on other tracks. We told them we wouldn’t work with anyone else unless it was Prince. They said “We can’t get Prince!” but did suggest his engineer, David Z, and said we could do it in Prince’s studio, Paisley Park. When we sent David some songs including the beginnings of She Drives Me Crazy, he went: “This is the song! Come over.”David let us use Prince’s room and all his equipment. The Purple Rain guitar was in the corner, his lava lamps were everywhere and the mixing desk had been used by Sly and the Family Stone. You can’t help but feel inspired in that situation, so we tried things such as putting the keyboards through Prince’s wah-wah pedals. Andy played the riff on Prince’s Rickenbacker guitar. David tells a very complicated story of how he got the snare sound by gating it and all sorts, but most of it was just the conga preset on Prince’s drum machine.When Roland came over later from London to do the vocals he didn’t have enough words. I thought of asking Prince to write some for us but that would have turned it into a Prince song. Instead, She Drives Me Crazy was in a notebook I had of song titles. Roland and I finished the lyrics like William Burroughs cut-ups – pillaging a line from another song of ours and such. Roland laid down the falsetto and a normal vocal running parallel, a trick Prince had used on If I Was Your Girlfriend.Prince was around but we were shy and didn’t want to bug him. After She Drives Me Crazy became the first No 1 single recorded at Paisley Park he played it in some of his post-gig jams and we were supposed to meet him properly. We never did, but sometimes it’s good to keep some mystery.Fine Young Cannibals’ career-spanning hits, rarities and remixes collection FYC40 is released on 5 December.

Now she has delivered a knockout performance as boxer Christy Martin. Sweeney talks about taking punches in the ring – and in the mediaMon 10 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareThere was much blood and sweat – but few tears – involved in Sydney Sweeney’s transformation into Christy Martin. David Michôd’s biopic of the trailblazing fighter, who hauled women’s boxing into the US mainstream in the mid-1990s, spends much of its runtime recreating Martin’s real-life fights. And she doesn’t always win. I left the screening wondering if I had genuinely just seen Sweeney – whose acclaimed acting career, canny commercial ventures and unwitting contributions to the online outrage cycle have combined to make her one of the world’s most famous women – being mercilessly and repeatedly punched in the head. Turns out I had.“Oh yeah, they were all real. Every fight that you see, we’re hitting each other,” says the 28-year-old cheerily. “I had concussions, there were some bloody noses.” Were the concussions frightening? “Nah, I loved it! The lady who played Laila Ali” – Muhammad Ali’s daughter, who defeated Martin by knockout in 2003 – “is an actual professional boxer. She’s in the air force and fights for Team USA – she hit hard and it was very, very real. She’s how I got my concussion.” Sweeney felt she truly “became a fighter. It was such an exhilarating feeling. In between takes, I’d be like: ‘I think I won that round!’”View image in fullscreen‘I became a fighter’ … in Christy.Photograph: Black BearIn the ring, Sweeney was essentially cut loose from the rest of the production (Michôd says the fighting was “a thing that I had very little to do with; it became a negotiation between Sydney and the stunt performers”). But when it came to bulking up – she gained two-and-a-half stone to match Martin’s fighting weight of “135 to 137lbs” – she had a buddy. On set, Sweeney kindly shared her calorific snack of choice, Uncrustables (this quintessentially American product, which Sweeney ate “endlessly”, is essentially a small frozen jam sandwich with the crusts cut off), with her co-starBen Foster. He also consumed “a lot of burritos” in order better to resemble Martin’s boxing promoter husband Jim. It worked. “I think it was the second week when Syd came up and just started touching my double chin,” recalls Foster. “She was like: ‘That prosthetic looks really good.’ And I said: ‘That’s not a prosthetic.’ I was like: ‘Yes!’” Foster mimes triumph as Sweeney chuckles at the memory.I’m always just me – and what other people put on me is uncontrollableFoster and Sweeney are sitting side by side in a hotel room overlooking the Thames; they are in town for Christy’s UK premiere at the London film festival (Sweeney has no problem watching herself on screen, Foster finds it rather painful: “Sometimes it cuts a little too deep – I love Syd’s approach”). Down the corridor are two thoughtful, softly spoken Australians: Michôd – best known for dystopian thriller The Rover and Brad Pitt Afghanistan drama War Machine – and his co-writer (and partner of 20 years) Mirrah Foulkes.Sweeney’s physical transformation and sporting prowess might be the most headline-grabbing element of Christy, but at its heart the film is a subtle and serious document of an abusive relationship: Jim is a master manipulator who takes full advantage of his position as his wife’s manager. For Michôd, the biggest draw was “the opportunity the movie presented to explore how these coercive control relationships function. I was that kind of run-of-the-mill numpty who couldn’t understand why she didn’t leave him.”The seeds of the film were sown by Michôd’s business partner, who informed him one day that Martin’s life rights were available. His first question was: “Who’s Christy Martin?” Once the director had familiarised himself with her shocking story – largely via Laura Brownson’s haunting Netflix documentary Untold: Deal With the Devil – he met Martin and realised what a compelling, complex character she was. “How this pugnacious, brawling, trash-talking, supreme athlete was actually incredibly gentle and vulnerable and wears her emotional scars so openly.”The real Martin – who now goes by her maiden name Salters – ended up being closely involved with the film, but she was initially unconvinced. Having experienced “a world of gangsters and rip-off artists [in boxing], I think she had the same suspicions of Hollywood,” says Michôd. Gradually, he and Foulkes won her trust. Then they set about looking for a star.Options were limited. “Obviously there are the commercial realities of needing someone of serious social stature,” says Michôd (Sweeney has 25m Instagram followers and is a tabloid fixture). “Needing someone of the right age, a particular physicality, and a hunger for it.” How did he know Sweeney had the right mindset? “You can just tell. I was on a Zoom with her and I could tell that she wanted this really, really bad. You can just feel that energy in a person.” He had the same hunch when casting Timothée Chalamet in his2019 historical epic The King.View image in fullscreenChristy Martin and Sydney Sweeney.Photograph: Joe Scarnici/MLB Photos/Getty ImagesWhen Sweeney first received the script, she didn’t know who Christy was either (“I was actually kind of disappointed in myself. She’s one of the most inspiring and remarkable women I’ve ever met”). Yet she soon realised that “on a lot of different levels I understood and could relate to Christy. She has her fight inside the ring and outside the ring and I fight within my own ring and outside my ring. Misunderstood. Complicated relationships. Growing up as a woman. Carving out our own paths and figuring out who we are.”To play Christy, Sweeney succeeds in pulling off a very delicate balancing act. Initially, this small-town girl from West Virginia is tough but entirely sympathetic: a mullet-sporting basketball enthusiast who refuses to be shamed for being gay. In the years that follow, she discovers a talent for boxing, meets and marries Jim – despite clearly finding him unappealing – and slogs her way to the top of her game. Finally, she’s signed to big-name promoter Don King and becomes a bona fide celebrity, working the chatshow circuit, appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated (headline: The Lady Is a Champ) and almost single-handedly introducing female boxing to the masses. We never stop rooting for her – yet her public persona is a strange, unpleasant beast. Now back in the closet, she makes jibes about other boxers being “dykes” and mocks them as they stagger round the ring in defeat. Meanwhile, she appears on TV claiming to be a traditional homemaker who staunchly refuses to give any support to other women in the sport.Sweeney has had her fair share of negative press, particularly therecent furore about her American Eagle jeans advert, whose tagline was interpreted by some as a nod to white supremacy. In 2022, she faced similar outrage when pictures emerged of guests sporting Maga-style caps at her mother’s 60th birthday party. How does she feel about that? “I think what’s interesting is I’m always myself. I’m always just me. But it’s what other people put on me that’s uncontrollable. Like you’re going to write this article … Then people will read it and have their own perception. So I try and be as much of me as possible, but it’s always through other people’s lenses.”Christy, however, is not being herself. Foulkes puts her aggressively regressive persona down to “this combination of very bad influences [in the boxing world] and also a great degree of self-loathing combined to create someone that was really kind of cruel”. Sweeney sees Martin’s apparent rejection of feminism and embrace of traditional values slightly differently. “I don’t think that she’s anti-feminist, she just wasn’t there to be a puppet for a movement. She was there to go after something that she loved. And what she becomes for other people – the role model she becomes – that’s not her end goal.” As for her isolationist approach, “in boxing, it’s a singular sport, it’s not a team sport. So it’s not like a big community of fighters fight together,” she says, with the absolute decisiveness that accompanies the entirety of her conversation.View image in fullscreenFurore … the divisive American Eagle jeans advert.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesSweeney hasn’t boxed since she finished work on Christy. Seven weeks after wrap, she began filming her next project – the long-awaited third season of HBO’s Euphoria, in which she plays Cassie (one of two Emmy-nominated watercooler TV turns that springboarded her to household name status; the second was privileged student Olivia in the inaugural season of The White Lotus) – “so I had to stop everything and drop all the weight”. As Christy, Sweeney felt “the strongest, full-of-life version of myself”. Was it hard to get back into her previous shape? “It was definitely a mental challenge and almost a physical withdrawal from being able to work out so much, which was kind of like a weird serotonin drop.”As a film, Christy is also an exercise in strange mood swings, lurching from a misty-eyed, feelgood sports biopic to something closer to a horror movie, as Jim’s mistreatment of Christy escalates into almost unbelievable depravity. How did Foster – who is spectacularly chilling in the role – manage to connect with Jim, a man with few redeeming qualities?Christy review – Sydney Sweeney fights a losing battle in cliched boxing biopicRead moreJim’s obsession with controlling Christy “is on paper a difficult thing to find a lot of compassion for,” says the actor. “So I guess in trying to find a brief way to say this: there are a lot of bullies in the world right now. And the way that they control one person or a society – or attempt to – [proves] they’re very fragile, and they’re very insecure.” Jim’s “increasing acts of control,” thinks Foster, were a way to “protect himself”. For Michôd, the key to Jim was identifying “this deeply embedded trauma in so many of these men”. Foulkes found it “important to find some way to humanise Jim without justifying horrific actions and that’s why I think Ben’s performance is very beautifully nuanced because he does manage some moments of humanity for Jim and charm even and brokenness”.At the end of a day on set, Foster found it extremely difficult to psychologically shake off Jim’s abuse. The material didn’t weigh so heavily on Sweeney. “I am capable of turning it on and off very easily,” she says of her ability not to dwell on the disturbing subject matter once the cameras stop rolling. Which isn’t to say she didn’t have an emotional connection to the material. When I mention the Oscar buzz generated by the festival circuit, she immediately deflects. “I mean, I’m incredibly honoured that people are talking that way. But I’ve always said that I did this for Christy. For me, all that mattered was that she was happy with the film and that people get to see her story.”Christy is released in UK and Irish cinemas on 28 November.

For my new book, artists and writers shared their advice on how to live life artfullyKaty HesselMon 10 Nov 2025 11.26 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 11.28 ESTShareHow many times a day do you reach for your phone? Do you jump at a notification, spend journeys locked in on your tiny black mirror? What about during meals, or when you wake up? Does it make you feel enriched, alive? I am just as guilty as the next person: swiping, liking, scrolling. But in a world built to distract us, how can we take five or 10 minutes away from that, and instead add something enriching to our lives?I like to look at artists for the answers. They get us to slow down and think about different ways of looking; to notice nature and beauty; time changing in front of us. They remind us of the joys of making, and in a world where AI is attempting to outsource our creativity to machines – the delight of discovering something for ourselves. Artists see the potential in something: like a word that can be joined up into a sentence that can grow into a paragraph, or book; or a tube of paint that can be used to create an image. Not only can these get us to see something from a different perspective, or teach us something about their world, but hold our attention, and invite stillness, too.King’s College London found that witnessing paintings in person lowers stress hormones by 22%It is scientifically proven: a2024 studycommissioned by the UK government found a high volume of evidence that consuming art can improve your mental and physical health – as well as, as Sarah Karlsberg writes, “reduce healthcare costs and increase the country’s productivity”. Last month, King’s College London found that when 50 people aged 18–40 witnessed paintings in person, theirstress hormones dropped by 22%. (Half the group were tested to look at copies: their levels only went down by 8%.)Whatever our situation, art and artists can guide us all. As someone who has always kept the words of creative people close to me – whether for inspiration or reflection, to help me in relationships or structuring my day – I’ve compiled 366 short passages of wisdom for every day of the year in a new book,How to Live an Artful Life.From words by artists including Tracey Emin and Marina Abramović to writers such as Ali Smith and Iris Murdoch, each entry includes reflections, rituals, encouragements, and creative exercises. Guided by the seasons (January’s theme is beginnings; February is love; August is beauty; November is memory), I respond to each passage, bringing the artists’ words to life, so anyone can partake in their creative act.I wrote this book at a time when I was feeling uninspired and distracted. It was reading these artists’ words that lifted me out of a darker place: whether it was learning of the routines of writer Patricia Highsmith who made working life “as pleasurable as possible” by sitting on her bed “surrounded by cigarettes, a mug of coffee, a doughnut …” or, doing as art critic Jerry Saltz advises, when in a museum, to ask the person next to us: “What are you thinking about that?” Conversation can be the greatest starting point for ideas. Museums are historically places for dialogue, debate, community, fostering in-person connection, and, wonderfully, many are free in the UK.View image in fullscreen‘Cigarettes, a mug of coffee, a doughnut’ … writer Patricia Highsmith on making her working life pleasurable.Photograph: Dino Fracchia/AlamyIf you’re feeling overwhelmed, writer Hisham Matar and broadcaster Claudia Winkleman suggest looking at just one painting at a time. Revisit it at different moments, and notice how it changes depending on howyouchange. Or, if you don’t have access to a museum, look something up in a book or online: show it to someone else and ask them, what’s that supposed to be? As Smith told me: “Whenever you stand in front of art, you attend and something in you has been awakened to it.”Why do we look at art? Maybe it’s because, as Paula Rego told her son, the film director Nick Willing: “An artist is someone who goes to a place where no one’s ever been before, but brings back something you’ve never seen but instantly recognise.”Living an “artful life” doesn’t have to mean being an artist. It’s about enriching what you already have, and, as Laurie Anderson advises in an entry in December (a month that takes the theme of joy), focusing on “Whatever makes you feel free and really good.” While wellness industry courses charge extortionate fees, artists like Abramović remind us of the power of sitting still: “Doing nothing is the start of the something.”Be in the world. Talk to people. Go to places, even if it’s not far. Look up into the expanse of the skies rather than into our tech-filtered selves. Take back your attention and give it to each other. The year ahead is a gift. Go out, seize it, and live it, artfully.How to Live an Artful Life: 366 Inspirations from Artists on How to Bring Creativity to Your Everyday by Katy Hessel is published by Hutchinson Heinemann (£16.99).

She did this supremely, of course, in Willy Russell’s Shirley Valentine, the one-woman play in which I directed her in the West End and on Broadway. This performance was so natural, so deftly balanced between innate cheekiness and a devastating awareness that her life was about to pass her by, that many people assumed it was effortless.On the contrary: she found it hugely challenging. Though she knew the play was a masterpiece, the prospect of doing it filled her with dread. Rehearsals were far from easy. The play is essentially a comic monologue and calls for very particular skills not possessed by all actors. I forced the poor woman to come into rehearsal every day and tell a new joke – torture for her, second nature to Shirley. Then there was the matter of getting her to credibly cook egg and chips while telling the story of her life. I knew she had to get all of that – the jokes and the chips – into her bones before she could stand before us as a three-dimensional person telling us deep truths about her life and the lives of millions of other women, all the while preparing the evening meal. As she struggled, Willy Russell began to have doubts about having cast her. “She’ll be fine,” he said, “but she won’t be Shirley.”At the first preview, the onstage lights suddenly crashed after three minutes. Out of the dark came the voice of Shirley Valentine: “Hey! Wha’s going on? I paid me electric bills, right up to date.” Huge laughter from an audience that realised she was improvising, a thing she had dreaded all her acting life. Willy grasped my arm in the dark and whispered urgently: “She’s got it. That’s pure Shirley. There’s nothing to worry about.”View image in fullscreenImmense range … Pauline Collins with Ben Chapman in Shades at the Albery theatre, London, in 1992, directed by Simon Callow.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyIn life, she was irresistible: kind, outrageous, sexy, loving, wickedly funny. We first met when I was cast opposite her in Bernard Slade’s RomanticComedy. The director invited us both to supper. “So, you’re a poofter, then, are you?” she said, before I sat down. I confessed that I was. “Good, right,” she said briskly. “Got that out of the way.”Both in London and in New York, she spread love and naughtiness throughout the theatre; every day was a party. Even those gnarled, cussed old backstageBroadwaycrews adored her. After a few triumphant months she left the New York production in a blur of emotion, her Tony award in her luggage. Days later, her successor having now taken over, the atmosphere backstage and front of house had changed totally, now functional and impersonal again.Her range was immense, much greater than she admitted to. I directed her again in Shades, a superb new play by Sharman Macdonald in which she played a woman whose husband has died young, leaving her in charge of their son, who does everything he can to stop her from committing herself to another man. It was a painful and complex relationship which she played with devastating honesty, to the acclaim of critics and to full houses.But, for reasons which I never completely understood, she hated doing it. So there was no point now in my trying to persuade her to play the lead in Seán O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock or Willy Loman’s wife, Linda, in Death of a Salesman. Never mind: what she did as Shirley and on screen in countless witty and brilliantly subtle performances was gift enough. What she gave to those of us who got to know her privately, as well as her audiences, remains an ineffaceable memory.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWilly RussellWest EndComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Simon CallowBroadwayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And while financial pressures remain, a host of other, smaller venues are bringing in vibrant new audiences.“I’ll have been doing this for 50 years next year and, to be honest, I’ve seen quite a few ‘resurgences’,” says Steve Rubie, owner of the606 Clubin Chelsea. But, he adds, there’s something genuinely different today. “Younger audiences are less scared of jazz. It’s all just music to them.”That open-mindedness and freedom has been powering London’s globally famous jazz scene over the last decade, as young musicians who were learning their craft atTomorrow’s Warriorsand the city’s music schools also cut their teeth in clubs, from late-night jams at Ronnie Scott’s to the improvised jazz parties of Steam Down events – all of it attracting an equally cosmopolitan audience.Those artists includedEzra Collective, who have won the Mercury prize and played Wembley Arena, and that kind of success is rooted in jazz clubs, “the heartbeat of the jazz scene” according to Aisling Doherty, programming coordinator at the EFG London jazz festival, which is back for its 33rd year this week. A strand of concerts at the festival celebrating the jazz club seeks to “honour the spaces who work day in and day out” to make London’s scene thrive, says Doherty.View image in fullscreenPerformers at Toulouse Lautrec jazz club, Kennington.Photograph: (no credit)At Ronnie Scott’s, the most famous of these London venues, straight-ahead jazz in the afternoon might attract more traditional listeners than the twenty- and thirtysomethings who would come out for a late show featuring live remixing and broken beat. But atToulouse Lautrecin Kennington, the classics of the genre are finding new fans. “Young people are keen to learn more about the history behind the music,” says manager Nolan Regent, who notes the popularity of their “the music of” series, which explores the work of iconic figures from jazz history. “I love that they’re listening to older styles of jazz.”And as jazz audiences grow, so are the city’s clubs. TheJazzCafe is extending into a neighbouring building, and in May was granted planning permission to transform an art deco theatre in Stratford into a new outpost. Ronnie Scott’s has completely renovated its upstairs space into a new small venue, which will open in February; its green room will double as a members’ bar, where performers and audiences can mingle after a gig, complete with a piano for impromptu jams.Blue Note is coming to Covent Garden in 2026, overcoming fears from police and local residents that its 1am closing time could result in an “uptick in crime” in the area – perpetrated against, rather than by, jazz fans. But the late licence was granted in May, and the space, in the basement of the St Martin’s Lane Hotel, is now being renovated to accommodate two performance spaces and a kitchen.While these prominent clubs arrive or expand, grassroots music venues in the UK are “facing a crisis of soaring costs and closures”, according to thegovernment’s cross-party Culture, Media and Sport Committee; research by theMusic Venue Trust(MVT) found that nearly half of grassroots venues were running at a loss last year.View image in fullscreenRonnie Scott’s new upstairs space, Upstairs at Ronnie’s.Photograph: Ronnie Scott’sMany are still struggling to recover from the period of closure necessitated by Covid, and London’s jazz clubs are no exception.Vortexin Dalston turned tocrowdfundingin 2020 to remain afloat and, like many venues, relies on volunteers. Kansas Smitty’s on Broadway Market closed during the pandemic and never reopened. The small basement space was a dynamic setting for the house band’s lively swinging – and the very opposite of social distancing. But for clarinettist and saxophonist Giacomo Smith, who co-founded the venue in 2015, the decision not to reopen wasn’t purely financial. “You only have one career – and for me, I want to play,” he says. “I don’t think musicians should start jazz clubs, just like I don’t think chefs should start restaurants. Because they care too much. At the end of the day, it has to be a business that works.”Add to playlist: the spiky, playful free jazz of Laura Ann Singh and the week’s best new tracksRead moreThe cross-party committee has suggested introducing a ticket levy on arena-level live music events – whether voluntary, and administered by an organisation such as the MVT, or government-run, as hasexisted in France since the 1980s– to feed money back into grassroots venues that are vital to musicians’ artistic development and their ability to make a living, and where “there’s an electricity … between the musicians and the audience”, says Smith. In small venues, Rubie adds, “being a member of an audience is as important as being a member of the band. It’s a joint venture.”At a time of polarisation, there’s renewed value to the intimate, dimly lit rooms where veteran jazz disciples rub shoulders with young, diverse new fans in the name of the music they love. So what can people do to support local clubs? “Visit them regularly!” says Rubie, adding that it’s also helpful to show venues support on social media. Regent says that he sees lots of people coming to gigs on their own. “Bring a friend,” he suggests. “Music should bring people together.”TheEFG London jazz festivalis on 14-23 November.Upstairs at Ronnie’sreopens on 6 February.Explore more on these topicsJazzLondon jazz festivalLondonMusic industryMusic festivalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Could a missile fired from the Pacific really reach Chicago in just 18 minutes? Is the decision to retaliate solely in the president’s hands?In particular, the Pentagon has challenged the film’s suggestion that US-launched interceptor missiles have only a 61% success rate at shooting down incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles, insisting that the real figure is 100% in testing. (The nonprofit Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferationputs it even lowerthan the film, at 55%.)However, one technological aspect of A House of Dynamite less in dispute – whether or not you are a nuclear expert – is the prominent role mobile phones play in the unfolding crisis. They serve as a touchstone across the film’s three-part narrative, helping ordinary viewers more fully enter an extraordinary situation. After all, whether it’s an iPhone, Android or other model, everyone has their own hotline now.A House of Dynamite is especially authentic in portraying the smartphone, like nuclear energy itself, as a dual-use technology – not so much in the strict sense of having both military and civilian uses, but as one we employ across our personal and professional lives. The phone serves as an instrument of intimate human connection and as the omnipresent avatar of work.The personal aspect is on display throughout, as characters desperately turn to their phones to warn loved ones about the imminent attack. But the movie establishes the centrality of phones in family life even before the characters learn of the missile launch.Near the start of the film, for instance, as Capt Olivia Walker (Rebecca Ferguson) leaves for her job monitoring threats in the situation room, she tells her young son: “Mommy’s got her phone.” Here, the phone becomes a symbol of the bond between parent and child.Later, we encounter secretary of defense Reid Baker (Jared Harris) as he takes a condolence call, during an early morning round of golf, about the recent passing of his wife. “We were lucky to have 33 great years,” Baker tells the caller. The phone is a source of consolation.View image in fullscreenWired … Rebecca Ferguson in A House of Dynamite (2025).Photograph: BFA/AlamyWhen we finally meet the president (Idris Elba), he’s in the Oval Office speaking via cellphone to his wife, who is on safari in Kenya. The scene underscores how the device can connect two people, husband and wife, no matter how far apart.In other scenes, by contrast, the phone is cast as a jarring intruder into family life. That’s evident when it interrupts deputy national security adviser Jake Baerington (Gabriel Basso) and his wife as they discuss their future during a traffic jam on the way to work.The phone’s disruptive force is shown even more clearly when the NSA national intelligence officer for North Korea, Ana Park (Greta Lee), is alerted about the launch while attending a civil war reenactment with her young son. In a bit of foreshadowing, her voice can be heard on the line amid gunfire, explosions and other sounds of battle from the reenactment. Park has also wandered away from her son to take the call.There are limits to the blurring of boundaries between the mobile phone’s dual nature, though, especially for high-ranking government officials. That’s highlighted when both Walker and Baerington are, separately, shown relinquishing their devices at a security check as they go into the White House complex. Later, Walker deposits her phone in a secure chamber before entering the situation room.The phone’s flip side, however – as an extension of human bonds – reasserts itself when Walker later breaks security protocol by having her phone smuggled into the situation room so she can warn her husband to evacuate Washington in case it, too, becomes a target. The moment links back to her earlier reassurance to her son about having her phone with her.For all the evidence A House of Dynamite offers about the crucial role mobile phones play in our lives, they can’t heroically save the day. That’s shown most poignantly when Baker calls his daughter in Chicago but gives her no warning as only minutes remain before the city is obliterated. Instead, he tries to smooth over tensions in their relationship, pleased to learn she’s in a serious relationship.View image in fullscreenHand to hand existence … Gabriel Basso as Deputy National Security Advisor Jake Baerington in A House of Dynamite.Photograph: Eros Hoagland/NetflixThat sense of futility also resonates on a larger scale. In a scene evoking the storied Washington–Moscow hotline of the cold war, Baerington negotiates with the Russian foreign minister in an emergency bunker beneath the White House. Cell phones have been swapped for more conventional phones. But the tense exchange brings no relief or resolution to the grim scenario.A House of Dynamite is both political fantasy and major disappointment | Mike McCahillRead moreFar from a calamity-averting innovation, the phone in A House of Dynamite becomes an emblem of human limitations. And real events suggest a mobile phone in the wrong hands may be more likely to lead us into a nuclear crisis than out of one. Consider President Trump’s recent post on the Truth Social app announcing that the US wouldresume nuclear weapons testingafter three decades to be on an “equal basis” with Russia and China.Russia responded that it would follow suit if any country resumes nuclear testing. US energy secretary Chris Wright subsequently clarified that the testing would not include actual nuclear explosions but rather “system tests”.If a president had used their mobile phone that recklessly in a nuclear thriller, audiences might find it hard to believe.Explore more on these topicsFilmKathryn BigelowDrama filmsAction and adventure filmsThrillersNetflixSmartphonesShareReuse this content"

Almost six years later, her death by suicide still feels shocking. Caroline was one of Britain’s most beloved hosts, best known as the face of Love Island UK. She had also presented The X Factor, and won the 12th series of Strictly Come Dancing alongside Pasha Kovalev. As well as an enviable TV career, she had the kind of girl-next-door approachability that made viewers feel as though they knew her off-screen as well as on it. Yet in the months before her death, her career had seemingly started to crumble, as she faced charges of assault by battery against her boyfriend, Lewis Burton.This new series comes from the makers of the 2021 documentary Caroline Flack: Her Life and Death. While that film sensitively examined the emotional issues that had beset Flack since adolescence, Search for the Truth concentrates firmly on the months that followed the alleged assault against Burton in December 2019. Caroline’s mother, Christine, has analysed the evidence and spoken to experts – among them Caroline’s former publicist, and the former chief prosecutor of the crown prosecution service (CPS), who once personally referred to the case as one of domestic abuse. Christine’s goal is to ascertain whether her daughter was treated differently by the justice system because of who she was. In other words: did Caroline’s public profile transform a charged row between a couple over accusations of infidelity into something with far more serious consequences?Caroline Flack’s mum, Christine, on seeking answers and setting the record straightRead moreYou may well wonder about the duty of care the programme-makers have towards Christine, and, in fact, to the whole Flack family. Gladly, Search for the Truth is neither exploitative nor cheap. It’s clear that Christine wasn’t merely parachuted in to front the series: rather, the episodes offer a window into the work she has been doing since her daughter’s death. She has no qualms calling up the Sun newsdesk, or breaking down her findings for a former Met detective,Jess McDonald. Christine is steely, strong and resolute. She wants justice, she says, and “will do anything to clear Caroline’s name”. The result is a two-parter that feels thorough and forensic, an antidote to the true-crime gravy train that usually steams through cases like this one.The inconsistencies pile up thick and fast, leading Christine to believe that her daughter caused minimal physical harm to Burton but had been made an example of nonetheless (claims which are vehemently denied by the police and the CPS). What’s more, she believes that the tabloids poured fuel on an already-raging fire by publishing images of a bedroom covered in blood – blood that in fact belonged to Caroline, not Burton. The scene was likened in the press to something out of a horror movie. While Burton did not receive any medical treatment, Caroline spent 12 hours in hospital due to self-inflicted injuries.The message here isn’t that women don’t abuse men. Rather, it is that – based on all of the official documentation examined by Christine – Caroline wasn’t a domestic abuser, but a woman in the throes of a mental-health crisis. Her emotional state was, in turn, aggravated by the media coverage of the case, not to mention the intense speculation on social media, some of which we see here. Once a prosecutor stated at a magistrate’s court hearing that Caroline had struck Burton with a lamp, press and public went into a frenzy. Christine recalls the Sun publishing a piece (later deleted, following Caroline’s death) about a Valentine’s card that featured a caricature of Caroline and the words “I’ll fucking lamp you”. Christine says she has found no compelling evidence that her daughter ever hit Burton with a lamp. The Sun says that it reported responsibly throughout.We hear several raw testimonies from Caroline’s close friend Mollie, one of the first people to raise the alarm when she was unable to get in touch with her on the day she died. There are also glimpses of texts and voice notes that Caroline was sending, as her anxiety began to spike around her future.As affecting as these elements are, I don’t believe that they’re designed to cynically pull on viewers’ heartstrings, but rather to take them directly into the isolation and dread of Caroline Flack’s final months. Nazir Afzal – a former chief prosecutor of the CPS – once saw it as an open-and-shut case of domestic abuse; when he meets Christine, he struggles to understand why Caroline didn’t simply receive a police caution. On one hand, Christine says, it is vindicating to hear. On the other, it makes it even harder, knowing that things could have been so very different.Caroline Flack: Search for the Truth is on Disney+ now.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Miller was previously shortlisted for the Booker in 2001 for his novel Oxygen.Kiran Desai is Miller’s closest rival at 2/1 forThe Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny,the Indian author’s first novel in almost two decades. The nearly 700-page book traces the lives of two young Indians as they navigate life in the US around the turn of the millennium. It is Desai’s third novel and her first since The Inheritance of Loss, which won her the Booker prize in 2006. If she wins again, Desai would become the fifth author to claim the prize twice, joining JM Coetzee, Peter Carey, Margaret Atwood and Hilary Mantel.Hungarian-British writer David Szalay has also seen a late surge in betting, withFleshshortening to 9/4 from 4/1 in recent days. Set between Hungary and London, the novel charts one man’s rags to riches story across several decades.The rest of the shortlist includesSusan Choi’s Flashlight,a sprawling family saga; Katie Kitamura’s psychological studyAudition;andBen Markovits’s The Rest of Our Lives,a midlife road-trip novel.“This year’sBooker prizeremains an open race ahead of Monday’s announcement, with Andrew Miller edging Kiran Desai as the favourite at 6/4,” said William Hill spokesperson Lee Phelps. “The 2006 winner Desai is only just behind Miller’s The Land in Winter; we go 2/1 that she picks up another Booker prize almost 20 years on from her first scoop with The Inheritance of Loss. This year’s field is looking remarkably tight, with little to split the six contenders.”Founded in 1969, the Booker prize is awarded annually for the best original novel written in English and published in the UK or Ireland. The winner receives £50,000, and the prize is renowned for boosting the international profile and sales of its recipients.Previous winners include Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, Ian McEwan and, most recently, Samantha Harvey, whotook the 2024 awardfor her space-station novel Orbital.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

A lot of actors do say that, which can sound like shite sometimes, but I genuinely do mean it. I feel more at home on stage than I do in life and I don’t know why that is at all.”Lowden’s films have included Mary Queen of Scots (2018) with Saoirse Ronan, whom he later married, and Benediction (2021), as the war poet Siegfried Sassoon. On TV, he is best known for appearing alongside Gary Oldman in Slow Horses, based on Mick Herron’s spy fiction. Lowden was speaking alongside Ireland and director Finn den Hertog at an Edinburgh screening of the NT Live capture of The Fifth Step, which was filmed at @sohoplace in London.The film is released in cinemas on 27 November.“Watching that was very strange – that’s the first time I’ve ever seen anything of myself on stage,” said Lowden in the discussion. Reflecting on seeing his stage performance, he joked: “I can only apologise for not really having an arse!” The Fifth Step was “the most actor-friendly play I’ve ever done … or seen,” continued Lowden, who suggested that was because both its playwright and director have worked as actors themselves.View image in fullscreenLesley Manville and Jack Lowden in Ghosts at Trafalgar Studios, London, in 2014.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn his early 20s, Lowden starred in the National Theatre of Scotland’s Black Watch.

The Fifth Step was his first play sinceMeasure for Measureat the Donmar Warehouse in 2018, staged by Josie Rourke (who also directed the film Mary Queen of Scots).The Fifth Step review – Jack Lowden and Martin Freeman go head to headRead moreLowden said that when he takes on a play, “I don’t really care what the thing’s about to a certain extent … I just care about the character and if the character’s worth playing”. The Fifth Step, co-produced by theNational Theatre of Scotland, was “a play written for two actors to sort of go mad and really push each other every single night”, he added.His character in The Fifth Step is Luka, who is new to Alcoholics Anonymous and asks the older James (Martin Freeman) to be his sponsor. The drama unfolds on the verge of theconfessional stagein AA’s 12-step programme, with Luka expected to acknowledge the harm his addiction has done to himself and others.Recognising the serious issues raised by the dark comedy, Lowden said: “There’s no point in doing [these issues] in a play unless it is, first and foremost, entertaining. No one should sit in the dark for an hour and 15 minutes and never laugh. I think that’s robbing people of their money.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreJack LowdenDavid IrelandComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)AlcoholismTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

In a dramatic turn of events, Burns was first to be caught and banished in the vote, then Marler was wrongly identified as a traitor and banished too.The three remaining players voted to end the game, after which Carr revealed he was a traitor, adding: “I’m so sorry, it’s been tearing me apart.” Afive-star Guardian reviewcalled the finale an “absolute blinder”.Among some of the more high-profile names on the first season were the actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry, the actor Celia Imrie, the Olympian Tom Daley, the singer-songwriter Paloma Faith, and the chatshow host Jonathan Ross.Popular moments in the series included Imre audibly passing wind during one of the missions, and Carr murdering his friend Faith in plain sight at the first opportunity.In the show, which began with 19 celebrities, contestants try to detect the traitors in the group while completing a series of challenges to win funds to contribute towards the prize pot. If at the end of the series a traitor is left among the finalists, the faithfuls, those who are not traitors, would lose out on the money and the traitor would win the full prize.Stars who could appear in season twoGareth Southgate– The former England manager is a fan of the show and previously revealed that the England team and staff played their own version during their free time at the Qatar World Cup in 2022. Asked by Chris Evans on Virgin Radio if he would ever sign up for the celebrity series, Southgate coyly replied: “Well ...”Danny Dyer– The actor said he turned down a request to appear on the first series, but has since changed his mind. Speaking on the Live and Let Dyers podcast, he said: “They did sniff around me about it. It was a ‘no’ because, for one, I hadn’t seen it, but now I’m into it … If the money’s right, I might get involved in the next series.”Alison Hammond and Dermot O’Leary– After the finale, the ITV This Morning hosts said they would both consider appearing in a second series. Asked if she would rather be a faithful or traitor, Hammond replied: “I’m not going to tell you that, just in case I do it.”A fan posted on X: “Season two with Alison Hammond needed NOW.”Mike Tindall –The former rugby star, who is married to Princess Anne’s daughter, Zara Tindall, expressed his interest in joining the show during a chat on the TV show This Morning. After viewing a snippet of the programme, he told the presenters Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard: “Having watched that, I think I would definitely enjoy doing that.”Bob Mortimer –After the comedian’s name was in the mix for the initial series, Mortimer said it was “the only show of its kind on TV that I would agree to get involved with.” The show’s executive producer, Sarah Fay, told Metro last month: “If Bob wanted to do it next year, we would absolutely love it.”Ruth Jones –The Gavin & Stacey star is rumoured to be “in talks to appear”, though it is claimed she would consider taking part only on the proviso she would be a faithful.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

The director, acclaimed for her bracing takes on Shakespeare, said Christie’s drama about a group of strangers snowed in at a remote guesthouse with a killer at large is “juicier” than she had previously imagined.“In life we all fancy ourselves as detectives,” said Ince. “She creates such nuanced and quirky characters that you want to get to know them and figure out whodunnit. It’s full of intrigue and mischief, funny as well as thrilling. Shows likeThe Traitorsand Only Murders in the Building are really popular right now. This is the original for people who want to lock in and see the real deal.”View image in fullscreenNicky Goldie as Mrs Boyle and Joshua Riley as Christopher Wren in rehearsals for Ola Ince’s production of The Mousetrap.Photograph: Danny KaanInce, 36, said that when she directs a classic play such asOthello,Romeo and JulietorArthur Miller’s The Crucible, all of which she staged for Shakespeare’s Globe, “what I’m contending with is tradition and what you inherit from a show. This feels similar – this show is older than me and audiences really feel like they know exactly what it is. I’m coming along and not taking it for granted. Before I worked on the show, I thought I knew exactly what kind of evening it was.”She discovered, instead, that Christie was a deft and perhaps overlooked commentator on postwar class structure. “With John Osborne, everyone spoke about how radical it was having working-class people on stage doing mundane things like ironing [in Look Back in Anger, which premiered in London a few years after The Mousetrap]. But at the top of Act 1 Scene 2 she’s got [proprietor of the guesthouse] Mollie Ralston hoovering. That was pretty radical too! It’s easy to forget that she’s commenting on changes that are happening hierarchically. The upper classes are falling away and there’s this want for equity … the play says a lot about injustice and the change that needed to happen.”View image in fullscreenSusan Penhaligon, Paul Hilliar, Derek Griffiths, Danny Mac and David Rintoul in The Mousetrap when it reopened in 2021 after its Covid-19 closure.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhen The Mousetrap opened in 1952, theWest Endcast included Richard Attenborough as the detective alongside the actor’s wife, Sheila Sim, as Mollie. The first director was Peter Cotes. Later directors included David Turner who worked on the show in different capacities for 30 years. Ince has taken over from Philip Franks. The Mousetrap also has an overseeing artistic director, Denise Silvey, who played the role of Miss Casewell in 1994 and 2001.A new cast begins performances under Ince’s direction on Monday night. Among the changes that Ince has introduced to “heighten what already exists” is a sound design by Max Perryment “to enhance the psychology of the play and the thrill of it”. The production accordingly has new speakers, the furniture has been rearranged and Ince has returned to Christie’s original manuscript and author’s notes. Balancing the comic with the serious is one of the main challenges, said its new director.The Mousetrap has been overwhelmingly directed by men although Phyllida Lloyd staged a 60th anniversary gala. “She’s my theatre mum,” said Ince with a laugh. Ince was the international associate director on theTina Turner musicaldirected by Lloyd in the West End. “We’ve had some nice chats about The Mousetrap.”View image in fullscreenAlfred Enoch and Rebekah Murrell in Ola Ince’s production of Romeo and Juliet at Shakespeare’s Globe in 2021.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe show has clocked up more than 30,000 performances since its premiere, its run temporarily halted only by Covid-19. Like many of Christie’s novels, which have had offensive language around gender and race removed by sensitivity readers, the script has been revised over the years. “I’ve come into a version of the play that omits some of the more hostile language, some old-fashioned sexism. But at the same time I’m cautious of erasing too much because it’s true of the time,” said Ince. “I don’t want to offend an audience but if you make everyone a bit squeaky clean then you’re avoiding that maybe someone’s an arsehole and that’s interesting – or that can be a red herring. You’ve got to be careful that you’re not making it all a bit bland.”Since 2017, a production of Christie’s Witness for the Prosecution has run in a courtroom setting insideCounty Hall in London. But people still classify Christie primarily as a novelist, said Ince. “I’d love people to celebrate her more as a playwright.” At times, over The Mousetrap’s extraordinary run, it has been the only play by a female playwright in the West End. She’s still in a minority now although Kate Trefry has had a hit withStranger Things: The First Shadowand Suzie Miller’sInter Aliais coming soon. “I think there are peaks and troughs when it feels like the world is a bit spicier because there’s more diversity,” said Ince. “Then it kind of dissipates because they’ve done that for a season. It’s amazing that Agatha has been strong for so long but sad that we’re still not really achieving [greater equality] now – or doing it in dribs and drabs.”The Mousetrap’s producer, Brian Fenty, said he was “thrilled” about Ince directing the show, which has run at St Martin’s theatre since 1974 (it was previously at the Ambassadors next door). “Ola is a force of nature – a director who understands what it means to be both a steward of history and a challenger of complacency. Her creative instinct is first-class, and her care and love for Agatha Christie’s world is as heartening as it is inspiring.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreOla InceWest EndAgatha ChristieCrime fictionFictionThe TraitorsnewsShareReuse this content"

With these resignations, it has given in | Jane MartinsonRead moreHe wrote he was “absolutely clear that the BBC must champion impartiality” and added: “We accept that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action.”Shah’s letter was published on Monday,hours after the BBC’s director-general, Tim Davie, and its head of news, Deborah Turness, quit over the scandal, which attracted Trump’s attention and sparked fears of recriminations against BBC journalists in the US. Trump wrote to the BBC on Monday threatening legal action. A BBC spokesperson said: “We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.”The resignations of two of the BBC’s most senior figures followed days of criticism from the White House and rightwing commentators in the UK prompted by claims in a leaked memo published by the Daily Telegraph.Trump and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, publicly celebrated the resignations of Davie and Turness. Turness said she “stepped down over the weekend because the buck stops with me”, but stressed that “BBC News is not institutionally biased”.In response to the crisis, Keir Starmer’s spokesperson said No 10 believed the BBC was neither corrupt nor institutionally biased but that it was right senior leaders had taken responsibility for mistakes.“We support a strong, independent BBC, and in an age of disinformation, the argument for a robust, impartial British news service is stronger than ever, but it’s important that trust is maintained and that errors are corrected,” the spokesperson said.Asked if the corporation was under pressure from rightwing attacks, the spokesperson said only that it was important to maintain trust. “Tim Davie and Deborah Turness have both taken responsibility for the mistakes. It is right we now continue to support the BBC, as an important national institution, and manage the transition,” he said.David Yelland, who edited the Sun from 1998 to 2003 and now presents a BBC podcast, told Radio 4’s Today programme that the departures were “a coup” orchestrated from the inside, and that Davies and Turness had been were systematically undermined by people close to the BBC board over a lengthy period.Yelland’s criticisms echoed a mood of dismay inside within BBC News, with one source saying on Sunday night: “It feels like a coup. This is the result of a campaign by political enemies of the BBC.”The Liberal Democrat leader,Ed Davey, wrote in a letter to Starmer, Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage on Monday that it was in Britain’s national interest to defend the BBC from foreign interference.“It should be extremely concerning to us all to see the President of the United States pressuring the BBC over its leadership and attacking its journalists as corrupt,” Davey wrote. “It should not be up to foreign powers to dictate where the British people get their news from. We must stand united to defend our democracy from foreign interference like this – even when it comes from a crucial ally.”The crisis was triggered by the leaked findings of a former independent external adviser to the BBC’s editorial guidelines and standards committee, Michael Prescott, who left his role in the summer.In his letter, Shah said that Prescott’s memo was a “partial” and “personal” account of BBC discussions and did not reflect a full picture of the internal discussions and decisions taken.Prescott’s memo criticised theediting of a speechby Trump in an episode of Panorama, which he argued made it appear that Trump had encouraged the US Capitol attack. Two sections of the speech that were spliced together were in fact delivered an hour apart, and the edit did not note that Trump had also said he wanted his supporters to demonstrate peacefully.Shah said the issue was “considered and discussed as part of a wider review of the BBC’s US election coverage” at an earlier stage, “given it had not attracted significant audience feedback and had been transmitted before the US election”. He said the points raised by this review were relayed to the Panorama team.But he added that “with hindsight, it would have been better to take more formal action” involving those who made decisions about the documentary.Shah wrote he had met with Prescott and discussed next steps, but that his memo was “his personal account of the meetings at which he was present” and that it did not “represent a full picture of the discussions, decisions, and actions that were taken”.At a press conference in Westminster on Monday, Farage claimed that the BBC had been “institutionally biased for decades” and that Davie should be replaced by “somebody from the private sector who has gone into a failing organisation, and has not just turned round the profitability but the culture”.He accused the corporation of “election interference” and called for it to be slimmed down and forced to compete with commercial providers for subscriptions.Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavieSamir ShahThe news on TVEd DaveyLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

But if Turner did have significant neurodiverse traits, I imagine they would have had quite a profound impact on his art and thinking.”Packham, an ambassador for the National Autistic Society, pointed to Turner’s “exceptional” keenness for detail and his “hyperfocus”, a state of intense, prolonged concentration on a particular task or topic, commonly seen in conditions such as ADHD and autism.“I see affinities there in terms of my own autistic thinking and approach to various things,” Packham said. “Turner was clearly a man who, today, we would say had focused interest. I’m still happy to call it obsession. He repeatedly returned to various locations he landscaped for a number of reasons – one being that he was probably never satisfied with what he’d achieved there.“I also see similarity with his attention to detail and his meticulous vision, which was particularly exemplified when he was younger, with his less impressionistic work. That ability to perceive it in the first place – every stone, every brick, every window – and how it interlocks with every other shape.”Raised in the gritty heart of Georgian London, Turner quickly became a young star of the art world despite his humble beginnings. He enrolled at the Royal Academy of Arts when he was just 14 and exhibited his first work there a year later.But the artist had a difficult childhood. He was eight when his five-year-old sister died. His mother, Mary, is believed to have had a psychiatric disorder and would fly into a dangerous temper (she was eventually admitted to Bethlem hospital, a mental asylum, where she died in 1804).Guralnik said she interpreted Turner’s paintings as expressions of “a tumultuous, turbulent inner world that was quite hidden from his outside expression”. She said the artist’s innate skills and talents, plus the experiences he went through as a child, “combined into this incredible force”.“I always knew Turner’s work,” the New York-based psychologist said. “But this documentary was an invitation to get to know a little bit about him as a person and suddenly opened this huge door into what these paintings were actually expressing. The inner world that was reflected in the water, the clouds, in the climate.”For Guralnik, Turner’s early propensity to draw buildings reflected his innate need for stability.View image in fullscreenThe Fighting Temeraire by JMW Turner.Photograph: GL Archive/AlamyDr Amy Concannon, the Manton senior curator of historic British art at Tate Britain, where theTurner & Constable exhibitionopens this month, said the roughly 300 sketchbooks contained in the Turner bequest offered an opportunity to “piece together his life”.“They tell us where he went and when and get us closer to his mind than anything else,” she said. “From these you get a strong sense of Turner as a determined and focused individual … He was an astoundingly productive artist, creating sketches at lightning speed and filling page after page on his travels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In The Fighting Temeraire, the ghostly and magnificent old piece of technology that fought at Trafalgar is towed by a black and powerful steam tug. In Rain, Steam and Speed, the steam train portrays the unstoppable force of the Industrial Revolution and everything that followed.”Concannon pointed to Keelmen Heaving in Coals by Moonlight, and Snow Storm – Steam-Boat off a Harbour’s Mouth, as evidence of Turner’s increasing fascination with changing industrial infrastructure, labour practices and pollution.She said: “Whilst Turner would not have been aware of climate change as we know it, he had a keen interest in meteorology and of course studied atmospheric effects for the making of his pictures. Although he left no evidence that he was deliberately doing so, we might infer that some of his more colourful sunsets were inspired by the aftermath of the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora.”That eruption, in what was then the Dutch East Indies, “basically precipitated climate change over a foreshortened period”, Packham said. “Turner liked to be humbled by the sheer incomprehensible power and majesty of nature. It’s rather tragic that now it’s not a volcano that’s shaping our climate and leading to famine and disruption on Earth, it’s ourselves.”Turner: The Secret Sketchbooks is on BBC Two on Wednesday 19 November.Explore more on these topicsJMW TurnerNeurodiversityAutismnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 32 when war was declared. Living in England at the time, he enlisted in the King’s Shropshire Light Infantry in 1915, having been rejected several times through lack of medical fitness. He had always suffered from respiratory problems and generally delicate health.He failed an officer training course, but went on to fight with the 7th Battalion, and took part in the battles of the Somme and Ancre. His novel, lauded by Ernest Hemingway among others,TheMiddlePartsofFortune,was published in 1929.Manning’s experiences of trench warfare also inform his best poems. His contact with Ezra Pound, whom he first met in London around 1909, had a further decisive effect on his poetic technique. These war poems, Leaves among them, form the first and most interesting part of his second collection, Eidola (1917). Even the title, meaning “phantoms” or “idols”, has a Poundian undertone. The entire collectioncan be read here.Leaves is a good example of Manning’s adaptations to theimagiststyle guide. It’s elaborate beyond imagism’s usual spare parameters but, despite the poem’s many pictorial figures and effects, the “little gilt leaves” in the second and 13th lines are an unforgettably defining image, singled out with a particular sense of exact visual weight.The leaves are unexceptional, perhaps, as they hang motionless in the deceptive pre-battle calm of the opening stanza. In the couplet, where the sudden two-beat line repeats and isolates the image with a new definite article (“the little gilt leaves”) something almost uncanny occurs. The leaves are falling but it’s not a natural, autumnal process; they’ve been loosened by the reverberation of “our heavies” (heavy weapons) with their “sudden clapping bruits of sound”. Admittedly, the last phrase is a tautology, but if the pronunciation of “bruits” is anglicised, as I think it should be, it heightens the impact of the adjective, “brute”, in the third line of the second verse. The final view of the leaves “like waifs and flakes of flame” doesn’t seem overwritten: the visual transformation of the leaves by the fire and firing creates further significant visual effects.The poem’s first line is arresting. Its two pairs of adjectives, shared between the mist and the branches, are made to work as a team, as if a thread of understanding existed between the “frail and tenuous mist” and the “baffled and intricate branches”. The word “baffled” suggests a natural life-form puzzled by warfare’s unnatural lights and noises, and also associates, in sound, with the muffling quality of the mist. The stars are perhaps predictably “indifferent”, but the characteristic is important in the small drama of unawareness characterising the scene – the somnolent puddles, the deeper woodland and the “valleys, / Brimmed up with quiet shadow, with a mist of sleep”. Perhaps the human actors who set the forces of war in motion without full consciousness of their devastating power are implicated. The poeticism of the the earth “steeped in the loveliness of moonlight” is almost absorbed into Manning’s overriding sense of the illusory peace that’s about to be shattered.As an unrhymed and somewhat experimental sonnet, Leaves is balanced in three sections. There’s a “turn” occurring after the five-lined first stanza , and Manning handles the change of mood and scene in the following seven-line block without loss of eloquence. Its opening is clear and dramatic. The simile Manning finds for the “hammering” guns – the “brute, stone gods of old struggling confusedly” – remembers and gives hard new force to the earlier bafflement of the tree’s branches. Then there’s a change of figure, and the sounds of the shells evoke a pack of hunting-dogs, “that stream whining and whimpering precipitately, / Hounding through air athirst for blood”. The hounds in their impatience to kill are given a line that seems to strain the metrical leash, and the presence of “hounding” in an unusual intransitive form adds to the swift menace of the four-beat 12th line: “Hounding through air athirst for blood”. Anger at the English class system may well be intimated in that unavoidable association of hunting and abused social privilege.Manning’s war service continued until early in 1918, when he resigned his commission as an officer. He was serving with the Royal Irish Regiment, perhaps motivated by loyalty to his parents, both of whom had Irish ancestry. He continued to write in various genres, including biography, and died in Hampstead, London, of the respiratory illnesses that had always relentlessly pursued him.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekFirst world warfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The poet who wrote punk into existence before pivoting to pop stardom then ghosting fans to raise a family has, in the 21st century, leaned into literature and music with such vitality it has become hard to say which medium suits her better. It hardly matters. At 78 years old, Smith lives and breathes both.Her latest memoir follows the tightly focused coming-of-age story Just Kids, published to great acclaim in 2010, and 2015’s more ruminative M Train. Bread of Angels splits the difference to create a more conventional autobiography. It could be described asJust Kids’ prequel and sequel, moving from Smith’s hardscrabble childhood to the near-present, where a striking twist takes the narrative back to her literal conception. It’s one of a number of revelations about an artist whose story would otherwise seem, by now, well-chiseled into the tablets of rock history.But surprises don’t feel crucial to a work that builds its world as much through narrative voice as its description of events. That voice can take some getting used to. Oddly formal, even archaic, in tone, at times unrestrained if not undisciplined, Smith’s literary mind is a wild mare. It can occasionally feel repetitive or self‑indulgent. But once you settle in, it casts a potent spell, and you’ll learn as much about the artist from her style as from the stories themselves.The book begins with a Proustian invocation, flickering between present and distant past, Smith confessing her outsider desire to “disguise the miniature Quasimodo trapped inside an awkward child’s body”, and introducing a recurrent metaphor, her “rebel hump” – a sort of holy flaw she comes to accept, harness and ride.Like many of us, she romanticises her childhood; 70 pages in, she’s still just 10 years old. She idolises her father, a damaged second world war vet who takes factory jobs to support his young family, moving them from a Philadelphia rooming house into nearly condemned government housing. They relocate 12 times before settling into a modest new development in rural south Jersey.Smith was a sickly child. Diagnosed with TB, she was sent to Chattanooga to quarantine and recuperate with relatives. In response to her metaphysical inquiries, they enrolled her in Presbyterian Sunday school. She yearned to create; she recalls her “outstretched fingers trying to reach the ivory keys” of her grandmother’s “glowing spinet”, and she kept diaries scrupulously. She’d disappear into reveries – in one story, she was waylaid by a tortoise en route to school and absent-mindedly lost the morning communing with it. She found similar escape in vividly imagined playtimes with sister Linda, younger by 11 months, and little brother Todd. “As our parents grappled with an uncertain fate, we practised oblivion,” she writes, among many singing sentences; “the future was a grownup concern.”She and her sister Linda discover something about their lineage that stops time, realigning the architecture of a remarkable lifeThere’s an awful lot of rambling through woods and yards, waiting for destiny to descend. It does, and you see the rebel artist being born in stop-motion. Smith refuses to salute the American flag in school, per the Jehovah’s Witness teachings her mother introduced her to. On her first trip to an art museum, Picasso and Modigliani light up her imagination. So do encounters with films (Lost Horizon), music (the Shirelles’ Will You Love Me Tomorrow, the album Another Side of Bob Dylan), and literature (Wilde’s The Selfish Giant, Rimbaud’s Illuminations). When art and religion inevitably clash, she chooses sides. “I was told that there was no place for art in Christ’s Kingdom,” she writes of an exchange with a church elder, “and I was counseled to consider what I truly believed in. But I knew what I believed in.”The tipping point comes when 19-year-old Smith announces she’s pregnant and, in solidarity, her brother confesses his own gender non-conformity. Smith gives her child up for adoption, heads to New York City, and begins the life chronicled in Just Kids. Those years, and her profound relationship with soulmate Robert Mapplethorpe, fly by in a blur here, the book’s tempo shifting from ramble to gallop. Her romance with Sam Shepard. Her debut at St Mark’s Church with guitarist Lenny Kaye. The touchstone CBGB residency. We learn that Dylan invited her to join the fabled Rolling Thunder Revue, then bumped her off the lineup on opening night. She hints at a love triangle between herself, actor Maria Schneider and billionaire Paul Getty. She recounts her principled knack for shooting herself in the foot commercially (refusing to alter the lyrics to “Pissing in a River” for radio, or to lip-sync “Because the Night” on American Bandstand). A final show for 80,000 Italian fans, and a pre-retirement counselling session with William S Burroughs, mark her 1979 exit from the public eye.The pace slows as Smith heads off to Michigan with MC5 guitarist Fred Smith. They live a bohemian love story: making their home in an abandoned hotel, refurbishing an old boat, travelling to far-flung artistic landmarks, money evidently available if not outrageously plentiful. They marry with just their parents in attendance. They have kids; she does laundry, and she writes. The narrative is radiant and intimate, but guarded. “The trials and challenges that Fred and I suffered were our own,” she writes elliptically in one moving passage, alluding to her husband’s health, his drug history, and whatever marital troubles they endured, declaring “his decline was the tragedy of my life”. A transcendent sequence that follows – like those moments in her songs when poetic incantation takes flight – displays her eccentric writing style not as a tic but a superpower.Fred Smith’s passing from heart failure in 1994 is followed by a cascade of other losses, deaths that trigger a creative rebirth. Michael Stipe cold-calls her (“confessing he was somewhat intoxicated”), jump-starting a long friendship. Allen Ginsberg urges her to return to the stage. Longtime comrade Tom Verlaine joins her band for a comeback tour. Dylan invites her to open some shows, and to singa magnificent duet, Dark Eyes. She captures that moment with her childhood hero indelibly: “I was somewhat nervous as Bob called me to the stage. I began the verse, and we sang the chorus together on the same microphone, our faces nearly touching. I could see tiny beads of sweat on his forehead and caught the intensity in his eyes. I gripped my dress and looked down at my bare feet, and for that moment I was just a widow and the raging young poet who once dominated my teenage senses, was just a man.”There are new albums, endless tours, books, awards, a doubling down on activism. And as the narrative spins into an elegantly diaristic laundry list, she and her sister Linda discover something about their lineage that stops time, realigning the architecture of a remarkable life. It’s a beautiful moment of storytelling. Yet her DNA doesn’t change what the book has already made plain – that the Patti Smith we know gave birth to herself. She sang herself into being. She’s written – is still writing – her own story.Will Hermes is author ofLou Reed: The King of New Yorkand Love Goes to Buildings on Fire: Five Years in New York That Changed Music For Ever.

Here, he reflects on AI’s ‘robbing’ of his voice, not believing in Black History Month – and why he’s nowhere near retirementDavid SmithMon 10 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Mon 10 Nov 2025 10.40 ESTShareIn a dishonest age when truth is under siege, media attention shatters into a thousand shards of glass and nothing is quite what it seems, what could be more precious than a voice of authority? Cue Morgan Freeman, an actor who has portrayed a US president,Nelson Mandelaand the Almighty, and replaced Walter Cronkite on the voiceover introducing the CBS Evening News. If John Gielgud’s baritone was described as being “like a silver trumpet muffled in silk”, Freeman’s is like rich wood polished to a quiet shine.It was less God’s gift than the product of hard work, thanks to an inspiring voice and diction instructor at his community college in Los Angeles. “If you’re going to speak, speak distinctly, hit your final consonants and do exercises to lower your voice,” says Freeman, dapper in light jacket , via video call from New York. “Most people’s voices are higher than they would be normally if they knew how to relax it. He taught that sort of thing. It was Robert Whitman: I will never forget him.”Yet the 88-year-old’s signature voice is no longer entirely his own. Hollywood is reeling from artificial intelligence that can replicate the way actors look and sound. The late James Earl Jones consented to the use of AI to replicate his voice as Darth Vader after he stepped away from the role. Freeman has not. “I’m a little PO’d, you know,” he says. “I’m like any other actor: don’t mimic me with falseness. I don’t appreciate it and I get paid for doing stuff like that, so if you’re gonna do it without me, you’re robbing me.”Has it already been happening? “Well, I tell you, my lawyers have been very, very busy.” They have already found cases and are pursuing them? “Many, yeah. Quite a few.”View image in fullscreenAs Thaddeus Bradley in the Now You See Me trilogy.Photograph: Steve DietlFreeman is equally unenthusiastic about Tilly Norwood, an entirely synthetic person regarded as the first “AI actor”, who was officially unveiled in September. “Nobody likes her because she’s not real and that takes the part of a real person, so it’s not going to work out very well in the movies or in television … The union’s job is to keep actors acting, so there’s going to be that conflict.”Freeman is here to talk about Now You See Me: Now You Don’t, the third in a trilogy of films about a group of illusionists called the Four Horsemen who use magic tricks to pull off audacious heists. He has a cameo role as magician Thaddeus Bradley, who was a foe in the first movie, an ally in the second and has now evolved into a mentor who shares a country pile (filmed at a 150-year-old mansion near Budapest) with a hall of mirrors and Harry Houdini’s straitjacket. Indeed, far from embracing AI special effects, the director Ruben Fleischer went in the opposite direction, bringing in illusionists to teach the cast authentic tricks.Freeman has always appreciated hard-earned craft. His beginnings were humble: his father was a barber, his mother was a teacher. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee, and spent most of his early years near Greenwood, Mississippi, in the Jim Crow south. From a young age, he knew what he wanted to do. Saturday matinee cowboy serials lit the spark.By 12, he had won a statewide drama competition; in high school, he performed in a radio play in Nashville. “I had the most encouraging teachers you could imagine,” he recalls. “One of my teachers told me, you can go anywhere and do anything you want.”View image in fullscreenFreeman in the children’s TV series The Electric Company, 1971.Photograph: John D Kisch/Separate Cinema Archive/Getty ImagesThere was a potential alternative timeline, however. “I never had moments of self-doubt about it but, when I was a teenager, I was fascinated by flying so, when I graduated from high school, I went into the air force with the idea at the time of becoming a fighter pilot.“That lasted until I got into the cockpit of a trainer and had that epiphany that ‘this is not what you want’. It turns out, I was just in San Bernardino, at Norton Air Force Base, being discharged and only a 45-minute bus ride from Los Angeles, California. Fate is the hunter.”From Amistad and Seven to Unforgiven and The Dark Knight, he has appeared in more than 100 films along with dozens of TV dramas and documentaries. In the 1970s, that included 780 episodes of the children’s series The Electric Company. His big break in Hollywood did not come until 1987, when he was nearly 50, playing a vicious pimp in Street Smart, and earning a supporting actor Oscar nomination.Two years later he starred in Driving Miss Daisy (reprising his stage role as Hoke Colburn, the chauffeur for a Jewish widow) and Glory, about an African American regiment in the civil war. Since then the hits have kept flowing. “If you do something that’s well received and it lasts years, people talk about the fact that you were in that, so it feels nice,” Freeman reflects. He must get that a lot withThe Shawshank Redemption? “Heavens, yes,” he says with a chuckle. “It’s like I was not ever in anything else.”View image in fullscreenPlaying a pimp opposite Christopher Reeve in Street Smart, 1987.Photograph: Cannon/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn Shawshank, he plays a seasoned prison inmate who befriends a rookie played by Tim Robbins. The movie initially flopped at the box office when it was released in 1994, but rallied on VHS video. It is now the No 1-ranked movie on the Internet Movie Database’sTop 250 chart, and in 2006 it was voted the greatest movie of all time by readers of Empire magazine. Just as Jaws or Star Wars are unthinkable without John Williams’ scores, Shawshank would not be half the film without Freeman’s wry narration.Freeman has his own thoughts about the film’s popularity: “I always say that it’s a movie about a love affair between two men, in that they had their ups and downs and ins and outs. And it’s something about the fact that they were in prison and experiencing this hope, redemption, resilience. Somehow that movie has grabbed the consciences of people all over the place, everywhere.“When the movie first came out, it didn’t do well at all. You know why? ‘Shawshank Redemption’ – [people] couldn’t remember that. ‘Saw this great movie. It was the Shank … Shim … Shanks … something like that.’ If you don’t get word of mouth, that’s it, you’re dead in the water. It’s as simple as that.”By this time, Freeman was already well into his streak of documentary voiceovers and authority-figure roles, from God (in 2003’s Bruce Almighty and its 2007 sequel Evan Almighty) downwards. Biblical gravitas had become his brand, you could say.View image in fullscreenWith Tim Robbins in The Shawshank Redemption, 1994.Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Columbia/AllstarHe’s not sure how he feels about that: “Gravitas, yeah. I don’t know, I’ve done comedies. But I’ll take it. It works for me, so no arguments.” He laughs. “It was interesting, though, the outcome of playing God in the movies. Audiences bought it. I meanboughtit. I walk into a room and they say: ‘God just walked in.’ I say something, they say: ‘Oh, it’s the voice of God.’ That went on for the longest time. Ooooo-Kay! Be careful there.” That must be a lot of pressure? “I vociferously avoid the pressure. It’s like, be cool, hold that down, don’t try to convince me that that’s who I am.”Freeman won a best supporting actor Oscar for his role as a gym assistant and former boxer in the Clint Eastwood sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004). Five years later, teaming up with Eastwood again, he was Oscar-nominated for his portrayal of Mandela in Invictus (2009).It was the story of how the South African president used the power of sport to heal the scars of apartheid, specifically by embracing Afrikaners’ cherished sport, rugby, as South Africa hosted the World Cup in 1995. Freeman says of Mandela: “When his book, Long Walk to Freedom, came out and he had a press conference, a reporter asked him flat out: ‘If your book becomes a movie, who would you want to play you?’ He saidMorgan Freeman.”View image in fullscreenFreeman’s performance as Nelson Mandela in Invictus in 2009 earned him an Oscar nomination.Photograph: Keith Bernstein/THA/ShutterstockAnant Singh, a film producer who had bought the rights to Long Walk to Freedom, put the two men in touch. “I told him [Mandela], if this happens and I do get to play you, I want to have access to you because I need to hold your hand. And he made that happen. Any time we were within proximity of each other, I was able to go and spend time with him and literally hold his hand and listen to him. Playing him was just a joy. I think I almost sounded like him.”He remembers Mandela, who died in 2013, as a man of modest ego. “We screened the movie for him and he said: ‘Well, maybe now they’ll remember me.’ Humble: that was Mandela. He didn’t get any different in his persona outside prison from what he had spent the whole 27 years in.”Freeman has had his fair share of flops too, of course. Not least among them Brian De Palma’s The Bonfire of the Vanities, released in 1990, co-starring Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith. Hotly anticipated at the time, it received a critical mauling and has now achieved a near-mythic notoriety.You’re opening up a can of worms here. No, I do not believe in a Black History MonthAsked if he has learned lessons from such failures, Freeman replies: “I don’t know if I actually can say I’ve learned a lesson. What I try to do is good work; do your job and the rest will take care of itself. I don’t know if there was a lesson that I learned while working. I think it was a lesson I’d known all along. I started acting in elementary school so I was always going to do it, whether I thought I was or not.”The indefatigable Freeman endorsed Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential bid and recorded a voiceover for the video introduction of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention in 2016. In recent years he hasspoken out against the terms “Black History Month”and “African American”.Seven at 30: David Fincher’s devilish thriller is a chilling immersion in evilRead moreDoes he still feel that way, now that Donald Trump has set about rewriting Black history from the White House? “David, you’re opening up a can of worms here with me. No, I do not believe in aBlack History Month. There’s something about it that separates it from American history. I don’t mind being called a Black man: that’s what I am. I don’t want to be called African American. I’m not African and that’s the bottom of it. That’s all I say.”Pressed for his thoughts on Trump’s second term, Freeman hesitates, then mutters, “I don’t want to talk about politics,” while publicists for the film, audibly uncomfortable, stage an intervention: “Hey, David, we need to keep this movie-focused.”In 2008, Freeman’s left hand was paralysed due to nerve damage from a car accident in Mississippi: his vehicle flipped multiple times and he had to be cut out by emergency crews. He wears a compression glove on the hand to help with chronic pain and keep blood flowing. That put an end to him piloting a private jet. Freeman had learned to fly and earned his licence in 2002, going on to own at least three planes. It was not quite his teenage dream of becoming a fighter pilot but did prove convenient for commuting from Mississippi to Hollywood. “You need two hands to fly,” he says matter-of-factly.He has now been screen acting for more than six decades but has little interest in retirement. “Sometimes the idea of retirement would float past me but, as soon as my agent says there’s a job or somebody wants you or they’ve made an offer, the whole thing just boils back into where it was yesterday: how much you’re going to pay, where we’re gonna be?“The appetite is still there. I will concede that it’s dimmed a little. But not enough to make a serious difference.”Now You See Me: Now You Don’t is released in UK cinemas on 14 November, and in Australian cinemas on 13 November"

According to the terms of the contract signed by the British painter’s prospective companions: “You must have sufficient personal insurance for your body to be flown home in case of fatality.” Or, as he warns beforehand: “There will be times on this journey when you wish you were absolutely anywhere else.” Fortunately, there is an upside to Foster’s deep wilderness expeditions in search of the perfect vantage point for a watercolour. “There will also be times of great joy, when you experience things you never, ever would’ve dreamt of.”Director David Schendel presumably signed in blood before hitching a raft ride with Foster on the Green River in Wyoming and Utah to make this engrossing docu-portrait. The 79-year-old – described by one longtime acquaintance as “two toothpicks in a potato” – is improbably hardy after more than 30 years of trekking: in the great American outdoors, Bolivia, Mount Everest, you name it. He needs to be: on one foray, it took him 16 days to locate the right spot. Once the easel is down, the self-taught artist makes luminous, airy panoramas with a jewel-like clarity. It doesn’t seem to be merely a question of imbuing a landscape with his personal feelings. The work, apparently, is meditative; it’s about what the landscape puts into him.Foster has a streak of self-sufficiency: growing up in deepest Lincolnshire, he bridled against traditional schooling and, for a time, wound up homeless on the streets of swinging London (something he initially refuses to discuss). Even so, the film doesn’t pinpoint why, decades later, he is still so driven. He states that he is a political artist, seeking to capture wildernesses that are fast disappearing. Time in the geological sense also looms; he speaks of being a “molecule on a gnat’s eyelash” in the face of nature’s monumentality. But it’s not clear if that’s a source of succour or – still sallying forth in old age – something to be defied, Werner Herzog-style.The film dissipates a touch when the old master gets back to his Cornish studio, where he finishes off each painting; Foster is crestfallen when his Green River haul is shipped off to the gallery. Some of Schendel’s shots on the trail are almost as splendid as his subject’s creations – but he doesn’t have to put in quite the same work.Tony Foster:Paintingat the Edge is in UK cinemas from 14 November.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsPaintingConservationArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

From here, it will only gradually become apparent that there is no great mystery to the film, Joel and Ethan Coen’s 2008 spy thriller pastiche Burn After Reading, its characters instead set to chase phantoms, walk down blind alleys and, ultimately, learn nothing at all.‘What a magic trick’: why Gosford Park is my feelgood movieRead moreIn one of the Coens’ noir-inflected knotted plots, Washington DC gym workers Linda (Frances McDormand) and Chad (Brad Pitt) happen upon a disc containing the raw memoir of former CIA analyst Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) – what Chad deduces is “highly classified shit” – and decide to try blackmailing the ex-spook for its return. Meanwhile, Linda begins a dalliance with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a paranoid US marshal who’s also having an affair with Osborne’s wife Katie (Tilda Swinton).Altogether, this adds up to a darkly, at times sadistically comic farce that centres the most dimwitted and unsympathetic collection of characters to front aCoen brothersfilm. Always given to torturing their characters a little, in Burn After Reading the Coens are merciless, whether they’re mocking the Ivy League pomposity of Osborne (who pronounces memoir “mim-wah”) or self-absorption of Harry (who believes he’s starring in his own conspiracy thriller, seeing a potential threat in every passing car and person that looks his way), or they’re subjecting one of their principal characters to a sudden, bloody death that’s as absurdly funny as it is shocking.Burn After Reading’s greatest joke, however, is its rejection of the very notion that a film should beaboutsomething, and perhaps especially when there’s such talent involved. You have the Coens, who just months before Burn After Reading’s release won Oscars for best director and best picture, as well as a cast of movie stars and esteemed character actors, here all playing numbskulls with gamely straight faces. Then there’s regular Coens composer Carter Burwell and master cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, who approach even such scenes as the unveiling of a homemade sex machine as though it deserves their aural and visual poetry.What these all bring to Burn After Reading is a significance, a gravitas that’s knowingly at odds with the triviality of the material, that disconnect making for a perverse kind of comic art.The film’s DC setting allows for higher interpretations. There’s commentary here, maybe, on the ineptitude and self-interest of those at the heart of American power – a reading that resonates in the Trump era, as it did in the film’s Bush era – or on adjustment to life in a post-cold war America, where historic enemies no longer pose a threat. (At one point, Linda and Chad try to sell Osborne’s memoirs to uninterested Russians, apparently too dumb to realise the cold war is over and that Russia is – at least at this moment in time – officially friendly.)But politics has never much been a feature of the Coens’ work, and the brothers themselveshave insistedthat Burn After Reading was not intended as a take on the contemporary American political climate. According to Ethan, Burn After Reading is rather a film about how everyone has within them an “inner knucklehead”; in other words, it’s a film about little more than the spectacle of its buffoonery. Harry and Linda in one scene can be seen braying at a broad fake Dermot Mulroney romcom, the Coens satirising what they considered to be the airheaded popular culture of the time, but if there was ever a Coen brothers film that you could shut your mind off to, it’s this one.Burn After Reading is, fairly, considered one of the Coens’ more disposable pieces. It’s that very disposability, though, that makes the film for me so reliably amusing, that knowing lack of importance that makes it such a tonic in important times (like, say, the sort we’re living through right now). Made in between one of their more “serious” pictures, No Country for Old Men, and a rare autobiographical work, A Serious Man, Burn After Reading is the Coens approaching a piece of material like a cat batting around yarn, the film-makers playing around with their characters and with audience expectations purely for the pleasure of playing.In the film’s final scene, a CIA honcho played by JK Simmons with hilarious bluntness closes the book on Burn After Reading, while dismissing any suspicions the viewer might still have that this story was “about” much at all. “What did we learn?” Simmons exasperatedly asks. And then the view pulls up and away from Langley, and back into the heavens, where you sense the gods – here, they would be the Coen brothers – have been this whole time laughing at the sheer stupidity of their own creations.Burn After Reading is available on Amazon Prime in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsCoen brothersMy feelgood movieComedy filmsBrad PittFrances McDormandGeorge ClooneyComedyTilda SwintonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now she’s back – and she hasn’t mellowed with ageMon 10 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTShare‘Things haven’t changed,” sighs Eve Libertine as she contemplates her new album. “All those songs are as relevant as they ever were.” The album in question, Live at the Horse Hospital, shows no sign that one of punk’s most anti-establishment figures is mellowing with age. Recorded at one blistering London live show in April 2024, Libertine collaborated with Chilean guitarist Eva Leblanc, reimagining tracks from Libertine’s back catalogue including ones from her time singing with 1970s anarcho-punk pioneers Crass. Produced by Crass founder Penny Rimbaud, it treads a path between performance art, experimental music and earth ritual; with her strident operatic tones, Libertine sounds like a soothsayer foretelling an apocalypse. It’s not an easy listen, but that was never the case with Crass, either.“We never had much fun, to be honest,” Libertine says. “It was really heavy going at times. We were angry; we were trying to say things in a way that was confrontational and shocking to get a reaction. And we definitely did.”Speaking on a video call from her living room, Libertine is good humoured, offering up stern opinions then laughing as she says them, like a chuckling assassin. She describes how Rimbaud’s lyrics to the track Rocky Eyes came from the band’s anti-nuclear activism leading her to see wastelands everywhere: “Looking at a tree and seeing it as …” She pauses on each word for emphasis: “A. Dead. Burned. Stump.” Then another sudden laugh.View image in fullscreenConfrontational … Libertine performing with Crass.Photograph: Courtesy: Eve LibertineThat sense of provocation and absurdity defined Crass, formed as a shouty agit-punk band in the 70s in the Dial House farm commune in Essex. The nucleus was Rimbaud on drums and Steve Ignorant on vocals, with further members added from the commune. Eve herself started out as a fan at their gigs, “which used to empty out. There was one where I was the only person left in the audience, pogoing alone in front of the stage.” By the late 70s she had moved into the commune and taken up a place in the band, adding a scorching vocal cadence that, along with the increasingly varied musical tastes of the other members, pulled them into more avant garde territory, as likely to release seething, abstract sonic collages as they were 1-2-3-4 punk thrashers.Crass were also politically radical, and several cases were brought against them in the 70s and 80s, first for blasphemy for the 1978 track Reality Asylum, with Scotland Yard’s vice squad raiding Dial House, before dropping the case. Later, their 1983 Falklands protest How Does It Feel (To Be the Mother of 1,000 Dead) prompted Tory MP Timothy Eggar to try (and eventually fail) to prosecute them under the obscene publications act.When I see what women are doing to themselves with tucks and silicon … sadly that line could have been written todayHowever, a 1981 charge of obscenity brought by Manchester police stuck to Bata Motel, one of the songs Libertine has decided to revisit on Live at the Horse Hospital. The charge was initially made against the album Penis Envy, copies of which were seized from Manchester record shops. A judge eventually upheld the charge against Bata Motel alone, deeming it “sexually provocative and obscene”.“Much to Penny’s chagrin,” Eve laughs again. “He would have liked to be prosecuted, and in the end it was me who was.”The track, a detailed depiction of living as a woman under the male gaze, was accused of being sadomasochistic pornography. Libertine didn’t bother attending the court hearing, but remembers what happened. “It was hilarious. The defence was using an album Peter Cook and Dudley Moore had got away with – it was about Jesus wanking or something – and played it in court. Of course, everyone was in hysterics. The judge said very sternly: ‘If anyone else laughs you’ll be in the cells!’ And so there was biting of lips and coughing fits.” She calls the episode “all a bit of a joke,” though the band ended up incurring heavy fines for the song.Libertine herself argues that Bata Motel is “quite the opposite” of sadomasochistic, and that its lyrics have become, if anything, more resonant with a younger generation of women. “I study myself in your reflection, and put it to rights with savage correction,” Eve quotes. “When I see what women are doing to themselves with tucks and silicon, and injections, facelifts at a young age … sadly that line could have been written today.”While she feels that the ills she has railed against since the 70s have remained – “warmongers, devastation, fucking the earth” – her proposed solutions have shifted somewhat and, surprisingly, she doesn’t call herself a feminist.“Our ideologies can hold us back,” she says. “I don’t call myself anything with an -ist on the end, because it can be co-opted. A lot of these movements, people have isolated themselves and that’s very sad. We’re all very armoured. Don’t see the armour, see underneath: we’re human beings under everything. When I look at my own fears and pettiness, my ego, I just want to see it for what it is and, in doing that, hopefully somehow see beyond it.”She thinks about what lies beyond that, and what still drives her art. “Anger. Anger, compassion, rage – and love.”Explore more on these topicsPunkExperimental musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Born in 1886, she studied with Stanford, worked with Vaughan Williams and, as a virtuoso violist, became one of the first professional female orchestral players in London. Relocating to the United States, her output declined, but her spirited chamber music and more recently her rediscovered songs, have proved fertile ground for today’s performers.In a deftly curated programme, the culmination of aWigmore HallClarke study day, youthful compositions rubbed shoulders with music from her most productive period, the 1920s. Ailish Tynan opened proceedings, her soaring soprano and snappy diction illuminating songs that suggested the influence of Vaughan Williams. Ravel, in Orientalist mode, hovered over settings of Chinese poetry, perfect material for Kitty Whately’s fresh, flaming mezzo-soprano with its cushioned lower register. Ashley Riches’ warm baritone embraced Clarke’s memorable melody for Yeats’ Down by the Salley Gardens while raising a smile in The Aspidistra, a melodramatic song about the calculated murder of a pot plant.American tenor Nicholas Phan lent his bright, lyric instrument and an expressive stillness to a handful of early German songs and brought an understated sensuality to The Cherry-Blossom Wand (Clarke once described the dividing line between music and sex as “so tenuous as to be almost non-existent”). Max Baillie was a sensitive guide to the masterly viola sonata, plunging into the heady waters of the rhapsodic outer movements and relishing the jiggery-pokery of the fleet-footed central scherzo. Anna Tilbrook was a poetic and authoritative guide throughout. Not every composition here was of purest gold, but the hit rate was remarkably high.Clarke’s best-known song is The Seal Man, a John Masefield setting in which a young woman is drawn to her death by a mysterious figure from out of the sea. Performed in a new arrangement for voice, piano and viola, Whately was spellbinding. Tynan, a singer in her absolute prime, was a hard act to beat, however. Accompanied by Baillie on violin, she brought delicacy, wit and an idiomatic tang to the scintillating Three Irish Country Songs.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

I stomped and chomped my way across the city to find outBen AitkenMon 10 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareIonce ate seven bowls ofragù bologneseover the course of a single weekend. I was in Bologna, to be fair, and on a mission – to get to the bottom ofspag bol(yes, I know it should be served with tagliatelle). A few years earlier, I did something similar with a Polish stew calledbigos(a sort of hunter’s stew). I wanted to learn about its variations, its nuances, and I wondered what you could find out about a place if you dived into one dish in particular. In the case ofbigos, I gleaned that the Polish are prepared to wait a long time for things to be done.My friend Tom suffers from a similar obsession (just last month he dropped a dozen scotch eggs on a bank holiday Monday) and so when he said he was heading to Paris to eat multiplesteak frites, I wasn’t exactly surprised. He wasn’t just going for a laugh, mind you: Tom runs a pub in London called theCarlton Tavern, and had come to the opinion that his steak and chips could do with a bit of zhooshing up. Hence the recce in Paris. But a man travelling all that way to examine meat and potatoes cannot do so alone, so I volunteered my services.A staple of French brasserie cuisine,steak fritescame to prominence during the 19th century, when Paris was filling up with a new, urban working class who wanted, well, filling up. It’s now a standard on anyprix fixemenu alongside coq au vin, duck confit and beef bourguignon.Steak frites came to prominence during the 19th century when Paris was filling up with a new, urban working classDespite its simplicity, the dish hasn’t avoided philosophical attention. In his essay collectionMythologies, the heavyweight thinker Roland Barthes gavesteak fritesa proper considering. Just as a cup of tea is traditionally regarded as the remedy to all varieties of strife in some parts of the world (“Lost your job? I’ll stick the kettle on …”), it seemed to Barthes thatsteak friteswas imbued with special significance. For the philosopher, the juicy beef was a sign of vitality and brio, and when paired with the humble chip, the result was practically a dialectic on a plate. Simply put,steak fritesis more than the sum of its parts.Taking advantage of theEurostar Snap service, which allows you to select the day of travel but not the exact time, I bag myself a discounted return for just £90. And so, within three hours of leaving London, we find ourselves tucking into our first steak.Robertet LouiseView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Paulo CartolanoThis homely outfit in the Marais has been going since the 1950s and cooks steaks over an open fireplace. The cut isentrecôte(AKA ribeye), which is served with sauteed potatoes and a green salad dressed with a classic vinaigrette. The steak is good, my medium rare (à point) is trumping Tom’s rare (saignant), the extra minute or so giving the fat a chance to render. There’s no sauce as such, but the mingling of dressing, meat juices and mustard makes a topping unnecessary. I ask the barman what he thinks of English wine. He says it’s a nice idea.€25, 8/10Brasserie LippView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Kalpana Kartik/AlamyA respectable amount of time later, we take on a rump on the other side of the Seine, on Boulevard Saint-Germain. Founded in 1880, Lipp is a classy joint – all vast mirrors and gleaming banquettes – and this particular lunchtime the place is abuzz. My slab (orpavé) of rump is fair to middling, but the fries aren’t as chipper as they might be. Once again there is no sauce, while the accompanying salad – some undressed lamb’s lettuce – brings little to the party. The best feature is the performance of our waiter, whose service manages to be exceptionally brusque yet unquestionably friendly. François explains that the 12 on his lapel conveys his standing in the pecking order. ‘‘I started at 23 and aspire to single digits,’’ he says. “And what happens when you get to one?” I ask. “You die.”€25, 6.5/10Le Pick-ClopsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Liliya Sayfeeva/AlamyOn François’ recommendation, we proceed to Le Pick-Clops, a laid-back bistro on the right bank of the river that is popular with students. Having learned that 2m bottles of wine are consumed in Paris each day, we do our bit to uphold this remarkable statistic by seeing off a carafe while waiting on our meal. The steak, when it comes, isonglet, or butcher’s steak, a cut that is typically dark and lean owing to the muscle’s working-class background. Here it’s served with a classically dressed green salad, a small gravy boat of blue cheese sauce and dauphinoise potatoes. There’s some chew on the beef but I don’t mind that, for it gives the dish’s other elements a chance to collaborate. On leaving, I ask the bartender where we should go next. He offers an enormous shrug and says: “Nowhere.” I give him a look designed to encourage elaboration. “Any place can do this dish,” he explains. “Don’t think about it. Just go.”€15, 8.5/10skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s on Boulevard du Temple in the 3rd arrondissement. In French,bouillonmeans a broth or a stock and also a large restaurant doing classic dishes at good prices – thinkoeuf mayonnaisefor €2.50. Whilebouillonshave been around for ages, this one is a fresh incarnation – though you’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise, seeing how retro the decor is. The rump steak asks a bit too much of my mandible, while the fries give the impression they were cooked a while ago – conceivable in a place with up to 450 covers.

For no other reason than it’s giving offAmélievibes and it must have been all of 10 minutes since we last ate, we walk into La Bastringue. The place is busy with local people. Red paint, a view of the kitchen, the noises of a French lunchtime – the atmosphere is deliciously Gallic. The steak ispoire de boeuf, a pear-shaped cut from the top of the hind leg that is beloved by butchers for being especially flavourful and tender. It comes with a kind of slaw, miniature roasties and a shallot sauce. Having noticed others doing it, I ask the waiter fortoutes les sauces, a small amount of every sauce on the menu, which he duly delivers. With my dipping options tripled, the meal proves a delight, and we declare Le Bastringue our winner, meaning that “nowhere” has triumphed. A lesson has been learned: sometimes one is better off skipping the queue, ignoring the hype and just going anywhere instead.€14,9/10Waiting for the train home at Gare du Nord, Tom starts sketching out his perfectsteak frites. By the time we get back to London, he has the details nailed down. Which steak made the cut? What potatoes prevailed? There’s only one way to find out: you’ll have to visit his tavern. (Or I could just tell you: it’songletwith skinny chips, dijon mustard and some smartly dressed leaves.)For the record, my perfectsteak fritescannot be put on a menu, for it contains no fixed elements or recurring features. It is the one that takes you by surprise.Shitty Breaks: A Celebration of Unsung Citiesis published by Icon Books. To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

And the chilli oil couldn’t be easier to make, plus there’s enough to stash in the fridge for the week to come – spoon over eggy crumpets, fried rice or cheese on toast.Chilli crisp-topped noodles with tofu and cabbagePrep20 minCook15 minServes2-32tbsp sesame oil5cmpiece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated2garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated2 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced150g shiitake mushrooms,roughly chopped280gfirm tofu(I likeTofoo), cut into 1cm cubes15ml soy sauce½ sweetheart cabbage, roughly chopped200g straight-to-wok udon noodlesSea salt, to tasteFor the chilli crisp oil50ml neutral oil– I use mild olive oil5g chilli flakes50g salted peanuts,left wholePut a large frying pan or wok on a medium heat, then add one tablespoon of the sesame oil. Stir-fry the ginger, garlic and spring onions for 30 seconds, then add the mushrooms and fry, stirring, for two minutes more. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, then stir in the tofu and fry for two minutes on each side. Add the soy sauce and 20ml water, then scatter in the chopped cabbage. Cover the pan, lower the heat, and let the cabbage steam for three minutes.Meanwhile, make the chilli crisp oil. Put the oil in a small saucepan on a low heat for two minutes – it needs to be hot without being burningly so; if it’s shimmering or smoking, it’s too hot, so let it cool a little, if necessary. Add the chilli flakes and peanuts to the hot oil – they should sizzle without burning – then take off the heat.Add the noodles to the cabbage pan and stir-fry for two minutes, or according to the packet instructions. Taste and adjust the salt as needed, then serve the noodles hot and topped with a teaspoon of chilli oil. Be warned, it isveryhot, so have a taste before adding more. The remaining chilli oil will keep for a week in an airtight jar in the fridge.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyVegetablesNoodlesTofuMain courseVegetarian food and drinkVegan food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

Food styling assistant: Simone Shagam.FoodLisa Goodwin-Allen’s reimagined chicken dinner classics – recipesSmall but clever tweaks to old favourites chicken kiev and steak diane (but with chicken) make for winner dinnersLisa Goodwin-AllenMon 10 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTShareThere is a unique comfort in the dishes we call classics, recipes that bring a sense of familiarity while leaving space for reinvention. British cooking is full of such touchstones, of dishes that feel timeless, yet that also respond beautifully to a fresh approach. I love exploring that balance, keeping the heart of a dish while introducing flavours, textures and ideas that make it feel new, and that’s the philosophy at the heart ofRosi, our new restaurant at the Beaumont hotel in London. Chicken diane and chicken kiev may be rooted in nostalgia, yet, with a little imagination, they can become exciting again.Chicken kiev (pictured top)Sometimes, even just a tiny tweak to an old favourite can make a world of difference. And, yes, truffle paste is a little pricey, but everyone deserves a treat every now and then, plus Christmas is coming up, so you can always use up the rest for an extra touch of luxury over the festivities.Prep15 minChill30 minCook35 minServes6For the truffle butter250g butter60g truffle paste(any brand from the supermarket will do), or 50ml truffle oil1 shallot, peeled and very finely diced (20g net)1 garlic clove, peeled and finely diced2 tbsp finely chopped chivesFor the chicken6 chicken breasts125g plain flour2-3 large eggs, beaten150g panko breadcrumbs4 tbsp olive oilPut all the ingredients for the butter in a blender and blitz smooth. Put the butter mix in a piping bag and cut a small hole at the base.Put the chicken breasts on a chopping board, then, using a small, sharp knife, cut a pocket into each breast from the fat end down and cutting about halfway into each breast. Pipe the truffle butter into the pocket, taking care not to overfill, then cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, put the flour, beaten eggs and breadcrumbs into three separate shallow bowls, and heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6.Take the chilled, butter-stuffed chicken breasts out of the fridge and, working one at a time, dip each one first in the flour to coat, then in the egg and finally in the breadcrumbs, making sure they are all well coated.Put a nonstick frying pan on a medium flame, add the olive oil, then shallow fry the breaded chicken breasts, in batches if need be and turning once, until golden on both sides.Transfer the chicken to an oven tray and pop into the hot oven for 15 minutes, until cooked through.Serve at once with creamy mashed potato.Chicken diane with mixed mushroomsView image in fullscreenLisa Goodwin-Allen’s chicken diane with mixed mushrooms.The classic steak sauce, but with chicken.Prep20 minBrine1 hr 30 minCook1 hr 30 minServes2For the chicken100g sea saltThe peel of1 lemon, shaved off in wide strips1 whole head of garlic, unpeeled and smashed just to separate and bash open the cloves a little2 sprigs fresh thyme5 black peppercorns1.2kg chicken crown, wishbone removedFor the herb butter stuffing115g butter25g mixed soft herbs(ie, tarragon, chives, chervil), roughly chopped10g smoked salt10g roast garlic(jarred or homemade), blended to a paste, or roast garlic paste100g brioche breadcrumbs, or panko breadcrumbsJuice and finely grated zest of 1 lemon, to tasteFor the diane sauce30g olive oil120g white onion, peeled and finely diced (100g net)150g mixedmushrooms(shiitake, oyster, button, chestnut, wild), diced1 garlic clove, peeled and grated80ml brandy1 tsp wholegrain mustard1 tsp dijon mustard1 tsp English mustard150ml goodchicken stock, a dark one, ideally30g creme fraiche2 tsp finely chopped parsleyFirst make a brine. Put the salt, lemon strips, garlic, thyme and peppercorns in a large saucepan, add a litre of water and bring to a boil, whisking until all the salt dissolves. Take off the heat and leave to cool completely.Put the chicken crown in the cooled brine, making sure it’s fully submerged, then set aside to steep for an hour and a half.Meanwhile, make the herb butter. Put the butter in a large bowl, whisk until white and fluffy, then fold in all the other herb butter ingredients until well combined. Season to taste, then put in a piping bag, ready for stuffing the chicken.Lift the chicken out of its brine and pat dry all over. Loosen the skin over the breasts and pipe in all the herb butter. If you’re not cooking the crown immediately, cover and put in the fridge.Take the chicken out of the fridge an hour before cooking, if need be, so it comes back up to room temperature, and heat the oven to 120C (100C fan)/260F/gas ½. Put the chicken on a rack set inside a baking tray, then roast for an hour and 10 minutes, until it reaches an internal temperature of 58C. Remove, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes. Turn up the oven to 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9. Once the chicken has rested, return it to the hot oven for eight minutes, until the skin is golden all over and crisp.While the chicken is roasting, make the sauce. Put the olive oil in a hot pan over a medium heat, add the chopped onion and cook, stirring, for a minute or two, until soft. Add the diced mushrooms and grated garlic to the pot, and cook for two minutes more. Pour in the brandy, turn up the heat to high and leave to bubble and reduce until the liquid starts to thicken and coat the mushrooms. Stir in all three mustards, then add the stock and bring to a boil. Take off the heat, stir in the creme fraiche and chopped parsley, and keep warm.To serve, carve the breasts off the crown, put one breast on each plate and spoon the sauce over the top. Again, this is great with creamy mash.Lisa Goodwin-Allen is culinary director atthe Beaumont, London W1Explore more on these topicsFoodChickenMain courseVegetablesBritish food and drinkMeatrecipesShareReuse this content"
