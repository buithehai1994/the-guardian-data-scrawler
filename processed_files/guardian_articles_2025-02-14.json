Ukrainian officials had presented a revised draft of the deal that couldopen up resources of rare earth metalsin return for US support. Members of the delegation later told Reuters that “some details” still needed to be finalised.The Ukrainian president seemed satisfied that, with the support of European leaders, he had managed to force the Trump administration to adopt a more considered and collaborative approach, after he was left reeling this week by a series ofunilateral unconditional concessionsTrump appeared to be offering to the Russian president.JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe’s leadersRead moreZelenskyy also seemed to have slowed the rush to staging imminent talks with Putin. He said that when he met his Russian counterpart – whom he called a liar – nothing would be kept off the table.Both Zelenskyy and Vance said they had a “good” conversation and would meet again for talks in future. “Our first meeting, not last, I’m sure,” Zelenskyy said. Vance said more talks would be held “in the days, weeks and months to come” – a longer timetable that will reassure Zelenskyy, who feared he might be bounced into formal negotiations.Vance, who was flanked by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the special presidential envoy for Russia andUkraine, Keith Kellogg, refused to go into the details of any peace plan, saying: “I want to preserve the optionality here for the negotiators and our respective teams to bring this thing to a responsible close.”Earlier in the day, European leaders claimed to have won US assurances that Ukraine’s leadership would be fully consulted over any peace talks with Russia and that the sovereignty of Ukraine would be protected, as they sought to ease fears that Trump was on the brink of abandoning Kyiv.A strong show of European unity in support of Ukraine at the Munich conference, coupled with private assurances from key figures in the Trump administration that decisions were not imminent, went some way towards dampening intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration’s foreign policy.European leaders were furious this week when the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, ruled out Ukraine ever joining Nato and said the country would have to abandon most of its territory occupied by Russia. Shortly after Trump unexpectedly announced thathe had already spoken to Putinfor more than an hour and would begin peace talks, Hegseth also said no US troops would contribute to any European peacekeeping force in Ukraine in the event of an agreed ceasefire.Zelenskyy said in his speech to the conference – an annual gathering of international security policy decision-makers – which he made before the Vance meeting, that he believed the US president was the “key” to ending the conflict and that Trump had given him his phone number.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Americans to realise that failure for Ukraine would not only weaken Europe, it would weaken the US too. Ukraine wanted a peace that was “just and lasting, so the horrors of the last years are not revisited again”, she said.She tried to reassure delegates that some voices in the often chaotic Trump administration still recognised that Ukraine’s long-term security was a crucial objective for the whole of the western alliance. Offering an olive branch, she told the conference: “We need to be honest here, and we need to avoid outrage and outcry. Because if we listen to the substance of the remarks, we not only understand where they are coming from but recognise there are some remarks we can agree on.”Although European leaders still talk about Ukraine joining Nato, Zelenskyy has long recognised that objections from the US and Russia make it a distant prospect.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, speaking after meeting Vance, said of prospective peace talks that “there was an agreement that Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal”. UK defence sources said there was little sign that Trump would be able to secure a quick deal with Putin since Russia believed battlefield gains would increase as Ukrainian morale crumbled in the face of the divisions in the western alliance.Zelenskyy tried to shore up his European support by warning that Russia could deploy as many as 150,000 troops next year to attack Europe. His key objective is to galvanise Europe so that it places tens of thousands of troops inside Ukraine as part of an enforceable ceasefire deal. He knows the deal will require him to cede land to Russia temporarily and will signal a long-term US pivot away from the defence of Europe.Zelenskyy added that he had no knowledge of Trump’s claim that Russian officials were travelling to Munich to join trilateral talks with him and the US.Von der Leyen also moved to allay US concerns about the level of European military spending by announcing she would suspend strict rules on public expenditure to allow governments to ramp up defence investments.Zelenskyy was bolstered by strong support from the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and an eight-nation Baltic-Nordic leaders’ statement. After a call with the Ukrainian leader, Starmer issued a statement that implicitly upbraided Hegseth and some of the freewheeling commentary by Trump, which was widely seen as unnecessary and leading to premature concessions before talks had started.Downing Street said the prime minister “was unequivocal that there could be no talks about Ukraine without Ukraine”. Ukraine needed strong security guarantees, further lethal aid and a sovereign future, and it could count on the UK to step up, a spokesperson said.The Baltic-Nordic group said: “We fully commit to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Ukraine should be given strong security guarantees.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVolodymyr ZelenskyyJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

The names included Mary Poppins, Mary Fairy and Homo Pomo, it was alleged.The company called in Paul Livingston, an employment law specialist from Outer Temple Chambers, to conduct an internal investigation.During interviews conducted by the lawyer, other staff stated that D’Amario had routinely used homophobic nicknames and language.One said they had heard the term “homo pomo” used regularly, considered it homophobic at the time and “didn’t think it was meant affectionately”.On another occasion, two witnesses said, D’Amario criticised displays in the company’s shops, saying they looked “too gay”. This comment had “horrified” some staff, according to one witness.In interviews with Livingston, D’Amario denied all allegations of using homophobic language, saying: “No, in my position the question of gay is the last thing in my brain.”One witness defended D’Amario, saying that he had never felt him to be homophobic, that “too gay” was commonly used in the fashion industry to mean overly flamboyant and that the Italian had come to his own gay wedding.The employee suggested that the language barrier could be a factor in “misunderstandings”.Another said they did not think D’Amario was homophobic.View image in fullscreenVivienne Westwood’s granddaughter Cora Corré quit the company in November last year.Photograph: Ki Price/Getty ImagesUltimately, the independent investigator upheld five allegations against D’Amario and said that the chief executive’s own denials of the alleged behaviour were not “persuasive”.The lawyer also said that D’Amario had expressed a desire to take witnesses to court or speak to them and at one point asked who was paying for the investigation and what would happen if the company decided it did not want to pay for it.“I have some concern that this was an attempt by [D’Amario] to put pressure on me as an investigator,” he said.The report included witness testimony that the investigator did not offer an opinion about because it was not directly relevant to the claim by the employee.That testimony included further allegations about D’Amario’s behaviour towards his employees.D’Amario, said one witness, was “about as politically incorrect as you could ever get”.He would, the witness said, say things such as “all these gay men in the company … you can’t trust them” and “all these gay men, they have no responsibilities”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Vivienne Westwood Ltd declined to respond to multiple requests by the Guardian for comment addressed to the company itself and to D’Amario.View image in fullscreenWestwood’s empire that is among the most loved and respected in the fashion industry.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images‘Excellent’ equality policies – but lack of action?Westwood’s knack for shaking up the world of fashion was forged on London’s Kings Road, from the shop that she opened in 1971 with punk icon Malcolm McLaren, the manager of bands including the Sex Pistols.Over five decades, Westwood built an empire that is among the most loved and respected in the fashion industry. It is also among the most profitable.Based in a studio in south-west London, Vivienne Westwood Ltd has more than 300 employees and reported pre-tax earnings of £44m on £133m of revenues in 2023, according to Companies House records.As the company’s boss since 1986, first as managing director and latterly as chief executive, D’Amario – a close confidant of Westwood’s – presided over this meteoric growth.That corporate success went hand in hand with a strong commitment to Westwood’s own values, including activism on the climate crisis and human rights, espoused on the company’s website.The label has also worn queer allyship on its sleeve, most recently via last year’s partnership with the non-binary singer Sam Smith.Smith walked the catwalk at Westwood’s show for Paris fashion week in March 2024, showing off its fall/winter collection, to rave reviews from LGBT media outlets.View image in fullscreenNon-binary singer Sam Smith walked the catwalk for Vivienne Westwood womenswear at its show in Paris fashion week.Photograph: Arnold Jerocki/Getty ImagesBut the independent investigation into D’Amario’s conduct raises questions about whether the company’s apparent support for the LGBT+ community translated into firm action when it came to its leadership.In his report, Livingston found that D’Amario’s behaviour in relation to two of the allegations constituted harassment under section 26 of the Equality Act 2010, as well as a breach of the company’s own internal equality policy.Executives were supposed to complete training on equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as unconscious bias for managers, the report found.Yet many of the company’s top executives – including D’Amario and Westwood herself – never completed the training because they were not “computer skilled”, the report found.Vivienne Westwood Ltd’s equality policy was an “excellent” one and would be a “useful starting point” for any future training, Livingstone added.“It is a matter for the company as to what action should be taken following this report,” he wrote.The company’s action stopped short of dismissing or demoting D’Amario.Instead, he appears to have earned a six-figure salary for the year when the report was written, according to company accounts, which state the company’s highest-paid director earned £493,697 for the year to the end of 2023.Vivienne Westwood Ltd did not respond to questions about what disciplinary measures had been taken against the chief executive.Explore more on these topicsVivienne WestwoodFashion industryCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

I didn’t expect it to get so big seeing as the fire brigade got there quite early,” he said. “The whole street was shut off and you could see the smoke from quite far away … it was crazy.”He added that he was “in complete shock” about seeing the thick smoke and flames: “My coat stinks of smoke right now … I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that in the UK or in London.”Crews of firefighters from across London were deployed to the scene, including from Euston, Kensington and Chelsea, Paddington, Soho and West Hampstead fire stations.By 5.30pm, about two hours after the fire started, thick black smoke was billowing from the roof and firefighters began using an aerial platform to pump water on to the area.Videos on social media showed flames at the top of the building being doused by fire officers on a crane, while smoke comes out of the roof.LFB firefighters said a cordon was likely to be in place overnight, preventing access to the streets surrounding the five-star hotel.Shortly after it opened in 2014, the restaurant was reported to be “single-handedly feeding the celebrity sections of the tabloids”, a place where paparazzi “loll and glower, ready to pounce on the luminaries who swarm [there] like candle-crazed moths”.It was given 5/10 for value for money and 7/10 for food byrestaurant reviewer Marina O’Loughlin, and described as a place that “seems to be almost permanently accessorised by Kate Moss”.Bill Clinton, Bono, David Cameron, Keira Knightley and Lindsay Lohan have been photographed at the venue in the past. Madonna and Naomi Campbell are also among its celebrated clientele.Balazs said: “It is with heartfelt gratitude and appreciation that we watched a remarkable 120 firefighters from [more than] 14 stations rapidly descend on what they told me was a hugely sentimental building for so many of them.“We know in fact one of those who rushed to the Chiltern Firehouse this evening had been stationed in the building when it was a fire station 30 years ago. I am truly grateful to all of them as I am sure that this is not the Valentine’s Day evening they had in mind.”Explore more on these topicsLondonHotelsHospitality industryFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

A week after he sent them tumblingout of the FA Cup, a breathtaking piece of control from the Japan winger to score the opening goal set up another memorable victory for Brighton and piled more pressure on the Chelsea manager.It meant a third defeat in their last four matches as Cole Palmer endured another frustrating night labouring as a false 9 before having to be cajoled to greet those travelling supporters who remained at the end. At times Maresca seemed lost on the touchline as he watched his side struggle to respond after Yankuba Minteh had made it 2-0 before half-time.Minteh’s second of the night killed off any hopes of a comeback and it could have turned into a Valentine’s Day massacre had Mitoma, João Pedro or Joël Veltman taken late chances. But having suffered his biggest defeat since taking over in the summer and with Fabian Hürzeler’s side moving to within six points of his expensively assembled squad, theChelseamanager will be wondering where the next win is coming from.Brighton 3-0 Chelsea: Premier League – live reactionRead more“We need to show more desire,” said Maresca, whose side did not even register a shot on target. “We feel upset and we feel very sorry for the fans. In this moment you cannot offer this kind of performance with 14 games to go. The fans have a right to be upset and the bad feeling is that we are conceding too many chances and not creating enough. This is a moment when we need to stick together.”Maresca brushed off criticism from some supporters this week after saying that their exit from the FA Cup meant they could concentrate on thePremier League, insisting that qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2022 would take the club back to where they “belong”. On this evidence, they will be fortunate to be back in the Conference League next season. “Probably since I arrived, that is [our] worst performance,” the Chelsea manager told Sky Sports.The decision to recall Filip Jörgensen in place of Robert Sánchez in goal meant the home fans had one fewer former player to boo. But they picked up where they left off last week whenever Moisés Caicedo or Marc Cucurella touched the ball.View image in fullscreenKaoru Mitoma fires in the opening goal from the edge of the area after an incredible first touch to control a long ball from his goalkeeper.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/ShutterstockHürzeler called on his players to improve their wretched recent home form that had seen them fail to win any of their last five league matches at the Amex Stadium if they are to stand any chance of qualifying for Europe next season and once again got the response he required. “We knew that we had to be compact against Chelsea but in both games the intensity was the key,” the Brighton manager said.After blazing over when he had an early sight of goal, Palmer’s next effort was even worse as it skewed way off target following a surging run down the right flank that proved to be the end of Noni Madueke’s evening. He limped off with a hamstring injury and was replaced by Jadon Sancho.Brighton, in their first league game sincea 7-0 humbling by Nottingham Forest, had shown only glimpses of their threat up until that point and their breakthrough came from the most direct means possible. Bart Verbruggen – whose disastrous own goal last week gifted Chelsea the lead – picked out Mitoma with a raking pass and the Japan winger’s first touch as the ball dropped over his head was immaculate before he drifted past Trevoh Chalobah and curled the ball past Jörgensen with aplomb. “When I saw his first touch … I’ve seen him do it countless times in training,” said Danny Welbeck. “It was a thing of beauty.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead it was the home fans who could not contain their joy when a haphazard Chelsea defence failed to stop Georginio Rutter’s cross and Minteh kept his cool to slot home from close range after being set up by Welbeck.Maresca sent his players out early into the cold Sussex night for the second half but the break did not appear to make much difference. Rutter should have done better when set up by Minteh and could only direct his shot well over. But Minteh made no such mistake when Levi Colwill gave the ball away cheaply and Welbeck again turned provider for Brighton’s third. Malo Gusto’s reward for playing him onside was to be hauled off for Reece James, while £115m signing Caicedo was greeted with chants of “What a waste of money!” when he made way.Mitoma could only fire straight at Jörgensen after a rapid break downfield as Brighton went for the jugular. The Chelsea goalkeeper was fortunate that the substitute João Pedro could not hit the target after intercepting a terrible pass out from the back before Veltman struck a post late on. The way things have been going for Maresca, he will be grateful for small mercies.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They had been celebrating Holi – a Hindu spring festival – at a nearby village.Vikat Bhagat, then 24, a local man who knew McLaughlin, was found guilty on Friday of her rape and murder at the district and sessions court in south Goa, her family’s solicitor said. He will be sentenced on Monday.After the verdict, McLaughlin’s mother and sister said they had endured eight years of torment trying to bring the perpetrator to justice, which had “finally been achieved”.McLaughlin had previously spent time in India as a volunteer in an orphanage and had come back planning to learn to teach yoga while travelling.Bhagat was arrested within hours of McLaughlin’s body being discovered.The body of the former Liverpool John Moores University student was returned to Ireland after her death, with a postmortem examination finding brain damage and strangulation as the cause of death.Her mother, Andrea Brannigan, and sister, Joleen McLaughlin, said in a statement issued by the family’s solicitor Desmond Doherty: “There was no other suspect or gang involved in Danielle’s death and Bhagat was solely responsible for cruelly ending her beautiful life.“We have endured what has been effectively an eight-year murder trial with many delays and problems, right until the end, all taking place thousands of miles away from Danielle’s home.”Her family said the trial had been very tiring but that they were glad it was over.Last year, the family’s representatives told how the case had been brought to court on more than 250 occasions with hearings sometimes lasting only half an hour on any given day. On more than one occasion they have been adjourned due to the unavailability of the suspect.Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Harris, paid tribute to the family, praising Brannigan’s “determination and resilience in the face of unimaginable tragedy”.Thanking lawyers in both countries, the family said that the quest for truth and justice had been “no easy matter”, but they were content that there had been “judicial confirmation in public of what we already sadly knew”.The family said: “We now hope not only that Danielle can rest in peace, but that we as a family can have some peace and comfort knowing that the person who brutally raped and murdered our precious Danielle has been convicted.”Harris said: “While nothing can ease the pain of their loss, I hope that this verdict represents some closure for the family. My thoughts will remain with them as they continue to grieve the loss of their beloved daughter and sister.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandIndiaEuropeSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Any potential reorganization ofOpenAIwill strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity,” OpenAI said on X, quoting its chair Bret Taylor, on behalf of its board.On Tuesday, Altman told news website Axios that OpenAI was not for sale. He hadrebuffedthe offer on Monday with a “no thank you” on X, prompting Musk to retort: “Swindler.”The consortium led by Musk, including his AI startup xAI,would withdraw its bidfor OpenAI’s non-profit arm if it drops plans to become a for-profit entity, the billionaire’s lawyers said in a court filing on Wednesday.US watchdog to investigate Musk ‘Doge’ team’s access to payment systemsRead more“Two days ago, you filed a pleading in court adding new material conditions to the proposal.

On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor’s profile claimed she worked at the Bank from September 2000 to December 2006. However, she had in fact left by March 2006 when she began working forHBOSin West Yorkshire.Asked about the accuracy of her LinkedIn profile on a visit to Nottinghamshire, Reeves told broadcasters: “I worked as an economist at the Bank of England between 2000 and 2006 before going to work in financial services for Halifax Bank of Scotland.“And I’m really proud of the work that I did before I became an MP, but in the end, people are going to judge me on the job that I’m doing now as chancellor of the exchequer to grow the economy and put more money in the pockets of working people.”Ministers ‘mission-washing’ spending plans in effort to avoid cutsRead moreThe controversy was reignited after reports last year that Reeves had not accurately reflected her job title on her LinkedIn profile, which described her as an economist at HBOS from 2006 to 2009 when her role was in retail banking. Her LinkedIn profile was updated to reflect that, and sources said at the time that a staff member had been responsible for the description.On Thursday, the BBC reported a further discrepancy over dates, and that Reeves and two colleagues at HBOS had been investigated over their expenses in relation to staff gifts. It said an initial inquiry suggested they appeared to have broken the bank’s rules, but that it was unclear what happened next.In a statement, the former HBOS HR manager Jane Wayper, who left the bank in 2008 according to her LinkedIn page, said she did not “recognise” any of the claims.Wayper said: “I would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer. I would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process. This did not happen.”David Sorensen, a lawyer who acted for the chancellor as she left HBOS, said she was not subject to “allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct” during her career at the bank. He was responsible for overseeing “a standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank’s restructure”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He claimed that the BBC’s reporting that Reeves was subject to an internal investigation into expenses while working at the retail bank was “totally inaccurate”.The broadcaster reported its discoveries on Thursday and said it had looked into the chancellor’s time working for HBOS between 2006 and 2009.Asked about the report when he appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Kyle said: “Unfortunately, the reporting has been totally inaccurate, and we heard yesterday that the person who was actually head of HR at that bank at that time says it’s untrue, said that she never, ever received a file on Rachel Reeves.”The minister was told that HBOS did not say there was no investigation, but that one had not been completed before the HR manager or Reeves had left the bank.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesHBOSBBCLabourBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that Trump knew the meeting was taking place, and had an assistant place a call to a mobile phone in the room.The US embassy in the UKtweeted a photoof the moment, showing Starmer at the dinner table with Burnett and others, using a mobile phone. The embassy said: “During the dinner @POTUS called his Envoy, who passed the phone to the PM”.Speaking to reporters from the White House on Friday, Trump said: “He asked for a meeting and I agreed to the meeting, we’re going to have a friendly meeting, very good.“We have a lot of good things going on. But he asked to come and see me and I just accepted his asking.”Responding to further questions about a date, he added: “Very soon, I think he wants to come next week or the week after.”The call, which once again emphasised the often freewheeling approach to diplomacy embraced by Trump and his White House, is believed to have been brief and only took in Starmer’s hope to visit the US soon for a formal meeting with Trump.No 10 will nonetheless welcome it, as it hopes Starmer’s tentative if so far warm relationship with Trump, who haspraised the prime minister, could lead to the UK escaping further tariffs or other penalties from an often capricious US administration. The pair spoke more formally by phone last month.Trumpappointed Burnettto his slightly vague role in December. The TV producer has been responsible for a series of hit US shows, notably The Apprentice, which gave Trump renewed prominence and arguably paved the way for his political career. Burnett also created or produced shows such as Survivor, Shark Tank and The Voice.“Mr Burnett and the prime minister agreed on the unique and special nature of the UK-US relationship, the strength of our alliance and the warmth of the connection between the two countries,” the No 10 statement said.“Mr Burnett reflected on his personal connections to the UK, and his mother’s experience working part-time in Downing Street as a waitress over 30 years ago.“They emphasised the huge potential for even stronger collaboration on trade, tech and cultural matters between the US and the UK and looked forward to working together.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerUS foreign policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A lexicon of Europe’s far rightRead moreThe backing of Vance – orElon Musk, who recently gave a video address at an AfD party summit– is unlikely to tilt the result of Germany’s elections, said Berzina. And it’s unlikely to browbeat the ruling Christian Democratic Union, which should win next week’s vote, into allowing AfD to enter any coalition.But the US right under Trump does have its eyes set on a broader transformation in Europe: the rise of populist parties that share an anti-immigration and isolationist worldview and will join the US in its assault on globalism and liberal values. They see those leaders in Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Giorgia Meloni in Italy, as well as the UK’s Reform party and Marine Le Pen in France.“It is personal and it is political in terms of far-right political alignment,” she said. “It also opens the door to what other unprecedented things are we going to see in terms of the US hand in European politics.”Could the US president even threaten serious policy shifts like tariffs based on an unsatisfactory German coalition? “That would be normally unthinkable,” she said in response to that question. “But in 2025, very little is unthinkable.”Trump has claimed a broad mandate despite winning the popular vote by a smaller margin than any US leader since the early 2000s. And he seeks to remake politics at home and redefine the US relationship with its allies abroad, many of whom attacked him personally in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and his second presidential campaign.Vance also wanted to antagonise Europe’s leaders on Friday. He refused to meet with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor who should be among the US’ key partners in negotiations with Russia over the future of the war in Ukraine. “We don’t need to see him, he won’t be chancellor long,” one former US official told Politico of the Vance team’s approach.That speaks to a trend in the Trump administration’s thinking: that voters abroad will handle what his negotiations and alliances cannot. As Vance stunned the European elite on Friday, he told them that “if you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you”.“You need democratic mandates to accomplish anything of value in the coming years,” he said.This is something that Vladimir Putin, who waited years for the return of a Trump administration, knows well regarding his war in Ukraine: sometimes you have to bide your time until conditions are right.And it’s something that Trump intimated about Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he riffed on his plan to end the war through negotiations that would cede Ukrainian territory and give up Kyiv’s designs on Nato membership.“He’s going to have to do what he has to do,” Trump said of Zelenskyy agreeing to a deal. “But, you know, his poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”Explore more on these topicsJD VanceEuropeTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsGermanyThe far rightanalysisShareReuse this content"

Here, we look at what he said – and whether it stacks up.United KingdomSpeaking about “our very dear friends, the United Kingdom”, Vance claimed a “backslide away from conscience rights” had “placed the basic liberties of religious Britons in particular in the crosshairs”.The British government, he said, had charged Adam Smith-Conner, aphysiotherapist and an army veteran, with the “heinous crime of standing 50 metres from an abortion clinic and silently praying for three minutes, not obstructing anyone, not interacting with anyone, just silently praying on his own”.Vance claimed that Conner told an “unmoved” law enforcement officer that he was praying for an unborn son that he and a former girlfriend had aborted years before. “Adam was found guilty of breaking the government’s new ‘bufferzoneslaw’, which criminalises silent prayer and other actions that could influence a person’s decision within 200 metres of an abortion facility,” Vance said. “He was sentenced to pay thousands of pounds in legal costs to the prosecution.”Fact checkSmith-Connor was convicted of breaching a safe zone in October last year, after refusing repeated requests to move away from outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth in November 2022.The 51-year-old told the council the day before he would be carrying out a silent vigil as he had on previous occasions. On the day, a community officer spoke to him for an hour and 40 minutes and asked him to leave – but he refused. Smith-Connor was handed a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay more than £9,000 costs after the case was brought by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council.Smith-Connor is receivinglegal support from Alliance Defending Freedom International, an American conservative Christian legal advocacy group thatstatesit “champions religious freedom through … advocacy efforts”. ADF International said it would be supporting Smith-Connor to appeal against the decision in July.Smith-Connor’s case was brought after a public space protection order was introduced outside the Bournemouth clinic in October 2022, which banned activity including protests, harassment and vigils.October last year saw the introduction of the Public Order Act 2023 in England and Wales, whichintroduced buffer zonesof 150 metres around abortion clinics to stop women being harassed with leaflets, shown pictures of foetuses, or having to pass by vigils.ScotlandThe Scottish government was said to have begun distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay “within so-called safe access zones, warning them that even private prayer within their own homes may amount to breaking the law”. He went on: “The government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime in Britain and acrossEurope.”Fact checkTheAbortion Services (Safe Access Zones) (Scotland) Act, introduced last year, introduced safe access zones within 200 metres of abortion clinics, banning harassing, alarming or distressing actions.“Silent prayer” is listed among the banned activities to prevent mass silent vigils that have been used by large groups of US anti-abortion protesters such as40 Days for Lifewho gather outside clinics to pressure women entering not to have an abortion.A Conservative US TikToker erroneously claimed that silent prayer at home could break the law inScotland. However the law states that the actions are banned if they are likely to cause alarm or distress to someone accessing abortion services. Silent prayer in a home which caused no distress and alarm to other would not fall under this category.A Scottish government spokesperson said: “The vice-president’s claim is incorrect. Private prayer at home is not prohibited within safe access zones and no letter has ever suggested it was.”RomaniaVance told the Munich security conference that a former European commissioner had “sounded delighted” that an “entire election” in Romania had been annulled. Vance added: “He warned that if things don’t go to plan, the very same thing could happen inGermanytoo …But when we see European courts cancelling elections and senior officials threatening to cancel others, we ought to ask whether we’re holding ourselves to an appropriately high standard.”Fact checkThe US vice-president was referring to comments by the former European commissioner Thierry Breton. The former French minister had been speaking after the decision by Romania’s constitutional court in Decemberto annul the early results of the country’s presidential election.The court had intervened after declassified intelligence documents pointed to what was described as a massive and “highly organised” campaign for the independent candidate Călin Georgescu, on the TikTok platform that was probably orchestrated bya “state actor”. Georgescu has committed to stop all Romanian political and military support for Ukraine if elected.Commenting on the case, Breton had said: “Let’s keep calm and enforce our laws in Europe when they are at risk of being circumvented … We did it inRomania, and we will obviously do it if necessary in Germany.”Elon Musk intervened at the time on X, referring to“the staggering absurdity of Thierry Breton as the tyrant of Europe”. Breton responded: “Tyrant of Europe? Wow! But No Elon Musk: the EU has NO mechanism to nullify any election anywhere in EU. Not at all what is said in the video below related only to the application of the [Digital Services Act] and its moderation obligations. Lost in translation… or another fake news?”BrusselsVance said that in Brussels “EU Commission commissars” had warned citizens that they intend to shut down social media during times of civil unrest at “the moment they spot what they’ve judged to be “hateful content”. In Germany, he claimed police had carried out “raids against citizens suspected of posting anti-feminist comments online as part of ‘combating misogyny’ on the internet”.Fact checkUnder the Digital Services Act, theEuropean Commissioncan ask a digital services coordinator in an EU member state to ask a judge to assess an application for a temporary restriction on access within the EU to a large online platform or search engine. The commission does also have the power to bypass the judge-led process in an “urgent situation”. The commission has said that such an extreme measure must “follow the due process” and “would be limited in time”.Restrictions on services can only be enforced where there is evidence of criminal offences involving threat to people’s life or safety. Should the commission use its enforcement powers, its decisions are subject to judicial redress at the European court of justice.German police carried out raids last March on the homes of people suspected of posting misogynistic hate speech on the internet, including those advocating rape or sexual assault. Police raided homes and interrogated 45 suspects in 11 states. None of the suspects were detained.SwedenVance said “the government” had “convicted a Christian activist for participating in Qur’an burnings that resulted in his friend’s murder”. He went on: “And as the judge in his case chillingly noted, Sweden’s laws to supposedly protect free expression do not, in fact, grant – and I’m quoting – a ‘free pass’ to do or say anything without risking offending the group that holds that belief.”Fact checkSalwan Najem was given a suspended sentence and a fine by a court over statements he made in connection with four incidents of Qur’an burning in Stockholm. He had carried out the book burning with Salwan Momika, who was subsequentlyshot dead during a TikTok broadcastlast month. Najem, who came to Sweden from Iraq in 1998 and has been a Swedish citizen since June 2005, told the court that his actions were legitimate criticisms of religion protected by Sweden’s freedom of expression laws. Göran Lundahl, the judge in the case, saidfreedom of expression did not constitute a “free pass to do or say anything”.GermanyVance cited the recent attack in Munich as reason for a “new direction”, suggesting the attack was typical. “An asylum seeker, often a young man in his mid-20s, already known to police, rammed a car into a crowd and shatters a community”, he said.Fact checkGerman police and prosecutors have said that an Afghan suspect in a car ramming in central Munich that injured at least 36 peoplewas believed to have had an “Islamist” motiveand will answer to charges of attempted murder. They have not found links to a jihadist organisation such as the Islamic State group nor any accomplices.According to the latest EU terrorism situation and trend report from Europol, there were a total of 120 terrorist attacks (98 completed, nine failed and 13 foiled) in seven EU member states in 2023. The highest number of terrorist attacks were perpetrated by separatist terrorists (70, all completed), followed by leftwing and anarchist actors (32, of which 23 completed). There were 14 jihadist terrorist attacks of which five were completed. Two rightwing terrorist attacks were foiled.Explore more on these topicsEuropeJD VanceScotlandRomaniaEuropean UnionSwedenGermanyexplainersShareReuse this content"

After nearly 500 days in captivity, all three appeared to struggle to see in the daylight, and were so weak that armed fighters had to help them walk.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy are flanked by Hamas fighters on a stage before being handed over to the Red Cross.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/Reuters“It was important for me to understand everything you’ve done and continue to do … I genuinely feel that you all played a part in giving me my life back,” Levy told the Tel Aviv crowd on Friday.“I may be here, but I still have many brothers and sisters in the hell ofGaza, and their time is running out.”The three men appeared more frail than the 13 Israelis and fiveThai citizenspreviously released in the Gaza war’s ceasefire, sparking fears that if Hamas is freeing the healthiest captives first, the next to return will be in even worse shape. For much of the Israeli public, there is a renewed sense of urgency that the remaining hostages must be brought home as quickly as possible.Niva Wenkert, whose 23-year-old son Omer is supposed to be freed during the first 42-day phase of the truce, told Reuters on Friday that seeing the state of the three men released last week was like a punch in the gut. “I’m afraid that Omer’s life is in danger, every minute, every second,” she said.1:09Israeli hostages reunited with families after release – videoThe details emerging of how the Israelis freed in the first four weeks of the ceasefire were treated have added to the anxiety felt by the hostages’ families and supporters.Some former hostages who spent months in Hamas’s underground tunnels said they were fed only three dates or half a pita bread a day and shared half a litre of water among several people. Accounts shared by family members in the Israeli media suggest many were regularly beaten, abused, starved and shackled in chains which meant they were unable to stand up for long periods of time.View image in fullscreenA rally in Tel Aviv this week demanding the immediate return of hostages.Photograph: Nir Elias/ReutersRan Gilboa, the father of the freed soldier Daniella Gilboa, 20, told the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth this week: “At the height of the war, there was no water, and Daniella and her friends were forced to drink filthy groundwater, causing her to contract a severe bacterial stomach infection, and she spent two weeks hovering between life and death. There were days when they had no choice but to eat donkey feed.”The hostages’ stories have increased public pressure on Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to ensure the fragile deal does not collapse, despite calls to resume the fighting from far-right members of the coalition that have threatened to collapse his government.It is widely believed at home and abroad that Netanyahu, afraid that losing office will leave him more vulnerable to corruption charges, has to date prioritised the survival of his government over a hostage deal.The latest weekly poll from the Ma’ariv newspaper showed Netanyahu’s Likud party losing seats – a shift commentators attributed to Ben Ami, Levy and Sharabi’s physical condition upon release. However, public opinion is not a determining factor for the success of the ceasefire, according to Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group thinktank.“The way the hostages looked accelerates the public pressure to get them out faster, but that was always there. It looks bad for Netanyahu if they come out in a poor state, but getting them out is still the best thing he can do in terms of what the public thinks,” she said.“Netanyahu wants to get back to war, because he and his partners have promised their base total victory over Hamas and a military solution, but he doesn’t want to be seen undermining the deal either. The momentum of the releases is hard to stop unless there’s a real and clear violation by Hamas.”At the start of the week the truce looked like it was in danger of collapsing after Hamas said it wouldsuspend this weekend’s scheduled release of three more hostagesunless alleged Israeli violations, including the continued killing of Palestinians in Gaza, were addressed. In response, Israelthreatened to resume the war, and Donald Trump inflamed the crisis bydemanding the group release all of the remaining hostagesthis weekend.By Friday, mediators appeared to have salvaged the deal, and Hamas’s smaller ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad said it would release three men as planned. Another eight living hostages are due to be released during the first 42-day stage of the ceasefire, and the remaining 68 are supposed to return in phase two.The deal’s future is still uncertain, Zonszein said, because the Israeli government does not want to commit to its second stage, which is due to begin in early March.“I think Bibi and Trump are going to keep trying to reshape the terms; it’s not clear yet what it is going to look like,” she said, using Netanyahu’s well-known moniker. “Ultimately, the hostages are Bibi’s secondary priority.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHamasBenjamin NetanyahuGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Or perhaps it ironically inverts the idea of a placidly bedtime drink of northern climes, which is of no earthly interest in the film’s passionately sunny, southern European settings.Fiona Shaw gives an excellent performance as Rose – querulous, cantankerous, witty – an Irish woman in her 60s using a wheelchair due to some mysterious ailment or psychosomatic condition. If it is the second, what is the cause? She has brought along her twentysomething daughter Sofia (Emma Mackey) with her on a trip to Spain where as a desperate last resort, she is going to consult an expensive private consultant Dr Gomez (Vincent Perez) about the debilitating pains in her bones and joints.While Rose is receiving treatment, something she treats with the same waspish scepticism as everything else, Sofia gets to hang out by the sea where she meets and becomes entranced with Ingrid, played by Vicky Krieps, a sensual free spirit who rides a horse along the beach and affects a Romany headscarf. As their relationship progresses, Ingrid reveals a childhood trauma which perhaps has an echo with Rose’s own hidden trauma; meanwhile, Sofia’s visit to her estranged Greek father does not seem to bring any calm or closure.Levy’s fictions present a distinctive challenge to the film-maker, of representing the more ruminative and contemplative qualities, and Lenkiewicz, in my view, has does done a happier and more successful job than the recent adaptation of Levy’sSwimming Home.The eroticism of what is happening is always undercut by the very real and very unsexy issue of if and how and when Sofia’s mother is going to stop using a wheelchair. The result is a complicated soup of moods and ideas, and the film is always in danger of drifting out into a sea of ambiguity – the ending brings us uncomfortably close to absurdity and even silliness. But the fierce sinew of Shaw’s performance gives the film some shape and keeps it grounded. Mackey and Krieps, both formidable performers, give the film their presence and force.Hot Milk screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmBerlin film festivalFiona ShawFestivalsDeborah LevyRebecca LenkiewiczreviewsShareReuse this content"

Cue the conservative outrage …Steve RoseFri 14 Feb 2025 09.59 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 12.51 ESTShareOf all the times to recast the most iconically American comic-book character with a Black actor and then pit him against a violently angry supervillain with an unnaturally reddish skin tone, who also happens to be the new US president … Sorry if that’s a spoiler, but it is in thetrailer for the new Captain America: Brave New World, just released into a tumultuous Trump-run America that’s itching for another culture war.IfMarvelwas looking for some attention to reignite its beleaguered movie franchise, it seems to have found it – but not necessarily the good kind. If nothing else, the image of a raging red superbeing rising up from behind the presidential podium and then trashing the White House is sure to provoke a reaction. As Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson takes up the star-spangled shield passed on to him by Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, his casting has already incensed a certain bracket of social media: “The new Captain America! DEI hire!”; “Sounds like another woke disaster from Hollywood”; “Boy, did you not get the memo? America just voted for Trump – your film is dead on arrival.” It’s a wonder Trump hasn’t signed an executive order banning the film yet.Mackie gave his adversaries even more ammunition a couple of weeks ago when he told the Italian press: “To me Captain America represents a lot of different things and I don’t think the term ‘America’ should be one of those representations.” Again, you can imagine the reactions – even if, as fans pointed out, Mackie’s predecessor in the role, Chris Evans, madevery similar commentswhen he was promoting Captain America: “I’m not trying to get too lost in the American side of it. This isn’t a flag-waving movie,” Evans said in 2011. Mackie had to walk back his comments the next day on Instagram: “Let me be clear about this: I’m a proud American and taking on the shield of a hero like Cap is the honour of a lifetime.”These are not the only battles the new Captain America finds itself caught up in. Attention has also focused on Ruth Bat-Seraph, aka Sabra, a minor character in the movie played by Israeli actor Shira Haas. In the original comics, Sabra was “the first Israeli superhero”; a mutant with superpowers who was formerly a Mossad agent. She’s had a bit of a makeover for the movie: no longer a mutant or a Mossad agent but very much a combat-ready operative.In a joint letter, some Palestinian cultural groups complained: “By reviving this racist character in any form, Marvel is promoting Israel’s brutal oppression of Palestinians.” They have called for a boycott of the movie, and pro-Palestinian protesterspicketed the Hollywood premierethis Tuesday, holding up signs saying things such as “Disney supports genocide” – again, necessarily not the good kind of attention.View image in fullscreenRemind you of anyone? Red Hulk/President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford).Photograph: Marvel StudiosAs if that weren’t enough, Brave New World has been plagued by reports of rewrites and reshoots, as well as recastings. William Hurt, who was set to play the US president, Thaddeus Ross, died in 2022 and had to be replaced by Harrison Ford. It was originally slated for release in May 2024. According to one insider, late last year it had gone throughthree rounds of test screeningsand was still getting negative feedback. The film-makers have denied this, although director Julius Onah acknowledged: “Every movie of this scale has additional photography baked into the creative process. There are things you’re going to refine and the story is going to evolve.”Without those delays, the movie might well have come out in the late Biden era, rather than the febrile first few weeks of Trump 2.0. At least they changed the title – the original, Captain America: New World Order might have been too much for the conspiracy theorists to handle.It was somehow inevitable that all this would befall Captain America, rather than any other superhero. He’s always been the moral conscience of the Marvel universe, and by extension, the nation. The character was created by Jewish writers Jack Kirby and Joe Simon in 1940, primarily as a wartime propaganda tool – the US actually entered the war a year later, so perhaps it worked. The cover of issue #1, showing Captain America socking Adolf Hitler on the jaw, told you exactly where his loyalties lay. Now, 85 years later, we find him socking the fictional US president in the jaw instead. And this at a time when the real-life president is happily dining with white supremacists and Nazi sympathisers such as Nick Fuentes and Kanye West (whose recent X post declaring “I’m a Nazi” ought to clear up any ambiguity). Not to mention Trump’s ubiquitous righthand troll Elon Musk, who has done nothing at all to correct impressions that he gave a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration a few weeks ago. It leaves you wondering who the real good guys are.View image in fullscreenThe first issue of Captain America, March 1941.Photograph: Courtesy of MarvelTime and again, it’s been down to Captain America to figure that out. While other Marvel movies have gadded about in weightless fantasy realms (Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool), the Captain America movies have often reflected off-screen political reality – and despite his ludicrously patriotic get-up (often worn by Trump supporters, or Photoshopped on to Trump himself), Cap has never been afraid to turn against his own government.It’s worth recapping the saga so far. Origin movieCaptain America: The First Avenger, released in 2011, explained how weedy army recruit Steve Rogers (Evans) was given an experimental superhero-creating serum in the 1940s, and riffed on his deployment as a wartime propaganda mascot. Things got interesting with 2014’s The Winter Soldier, in which Rogers is thawed out in the present day and finds the US about to instate a global surveillance regime that would predict and preemptively eliminate threats. This was the era of the Edward Snowden leaks, so the paranoid conspiracy element was not too difficult to swallow. But good old Cap wasn’t having it: “This isn’t freedom – it’s fear,” he said, stepping away from his quasi-military role. He was right: it later transpired that the US government had been infiltrated by the neo-Nazi organisation Hydra – again, a concept that’s no longer too difficult to swallow.And by his side in his fight to de-Nazify the government was Mackie’s character, Sam Wilson, aka Falcon, a modern-day Iraq war veteran who befriended Rogers. In 2016’sCaptain America: Civil War, Rogers and Wilson again fell out with the authorities, refusing to agree to UN oversight of “enhanced individuals” – those with superpowers. They trusted their own judgment above that of the politicians.View image in fullscreenChris Evans in Captain America – First Avenger.Photograph: Marvel Studios/Sportsphoto/Allstar2019’s all-conquering Avengers: Endgame culminated with Evans’ Captain America retiring, and passing on his shield to Mackie’s Falcon. After that the saga headed into race politics and Black history – possibly blown in that direction by the cultural winds post-Black Lives Matter. In his small-screen spin-off Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Falcon hands the shield back to the government – “It feels like it belongs to someone else,” he says. Not only does he deem himself unworthy, his patriotism to a country that enslaved and discriminated against his forebears is understandably conflicted. Another Black character tells him: “They will never let a Black man be Captain America, and even if they did, no self-respecting Black man would ever want to be.” Sure enough, a new, white Captain America is anointed: John Walker, played by Wyatt Russell. But to cut a long story short, it turns out he’s unworthy, and Wilson ultimately winds up with the shield again.Politics were very much in the minds of the Russo brothers, who jointly directed Winter Soldier, Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. “Those movies are very much about what went on in this country over the past four years,” Joe Russotold me in 2021. “Some of the worst people were being attracted to politics and were representing us collectively … We believed strongly that the reach in those movies was so significant that they could be influential in helping people potentially make better decisions. We thought that they were a really powerful tool, at exactly the right time.”Brave New World should at least satisfy fans who wanted a political action thriller along the lines of Winter Soldier, with no space people turning up from parallel universes. Mackie’s fledgling Cap initially agrees to work with Ford’s new president, but before long, he’s disobeying orders and going rogue once again to investigate a conspiracy. Despite the raging Hulk “reveal”, and the president surviving an assassination attempt, Ford’s character is not all that Trump-like: he cares about international cooperation, he has a Black female head of security, and he even gets on an exercise bike on Air Force One. Depending on how you see it, this is either a bullet dodged or a punch pulled. This president does, however, outsource tech and military innovation to a shifty, unbiddable genius scientist who’s described as “his own personal thinktank” – remind you of anyone?There’s no telling how any of this will play in today’s movie landscape. Marvel movies have been at the vanguard of Hollywood representation in recent years but this has not translated into box-office success lately. Recent movie outings such as The Eternals and The Marvels – neither of which were directed by or centred on white men – were met with opposition by some fans (especially the vehement “Everything is woke” brigade), but also by some critics (for not being very good). Meanwhile, Marvel’s franchise-milking small-screen offshoots (Loki, Wandavision, Ms Marvel, She-Hulk, etc) and confusing “multiverse” storylines have turned off even more viewers. It’s telling that Marvel’s only recent box-office success was the more flip and irreverent Deadpool & Wolverine (led by two white guys).View image in fullscreenFlorence Pugh in Thunderbolts.Photograph: Marvel StudiosSo perhaps the message is: nobody’s in the mood for superheroes getting too real and political any more, and the era of applauding movies for representation has been killed by Trump’s anti-DEI edicts. Marvel seems to be hedging its bets: next up, in April, is Thunderbolts – the first outing for a new bunch of (overwhelmingly white) superhero misfits, including Florence Pugh and Wyatt Russell’s John Walker.But ultimately, Mackie was right when he said Captain America was not really about “America”. Unlike the cosplaying Trump supporters, he’s more loyal to American values than to the flag, and over his long history, he’s often had to remind the nation what those values are. In one comic-book story (What If … #44), 1940s Captain America wakes up in 1984, where he finds a fascist “America first” president who is persecuting minorities and promising to make America great again. Cap lays it downin no uncertain terms: “Without its ideals – its commitment to the freedom of all men, America is a piece of trash! I fought Adolf Hitler not because America was great, but because it was fragile! I knew that liberty could as easily be snuffed out here as in Nazi Germany!” Maybe they can use that storyline for the next movie, if there is one.This article was amended on 14 February 2025. The Falcon character Anthony Mackie plays is Sam Wilson, not Jackson as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsFilmCaptain America: Civil WarCaptain America: The First AvengerCaptain America: The Winter SoldierUS politicsHarrison FordMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But winter swimming does require a little bit more than a swimsuit and towel to make the experience more bearable. Here is my go-to winter kit list for outdoor dips, swims and adventures: I’ve either tested or already own everything here.A note on neoprene: neoprene is a synthetic rubber used widely in watersport gear but its production is not without environmental and social impact. We have suggested kit made with other materials where possible.The best kit for winter swimmingSwimsuitView image in fullscreenZoggs Brave crossback£65 at Zoggs£64.99 at Swim the LakesWinter swimming often involves short dips, so I like a standard suit that keeps my core warmer but exposes as much skin as possible to the cold zing of the water.Itested this silver-lined swimsuit from Zoggs, and rated it my best overall: I felt warmer in the water, and my recovery was quicker too. The glorious neon animal print design is perfect for visibility in the grey, low light of winter. I also loved that you can remove the padded cups in the bust area.Read our guide tothe best tried and tested cold-water swimsuitsNeopreneglovesand socksFor years I endured cold fingers and toes with the common view that if I wore neoprene in any form I would be “cheating”. Our extremities have little fat and muscle to protect them from the cold, so the discomfort can be unbearable when they’re immersed in cold water. Wearing neoprene gloves and socks was the best decision I made.Look for a snug fit – too loose and they will fill with water, which will affect your swimming and cancel any thermal benefits. And measure yourself and use the online size guides.View image in fullscreenFourth Element 3mm neoprene gloves£58 at Fourth Element£58 at the Wild Swim StoreThese Fourth Element gloves are a decent thickness and the Octo-print palm means you can still grip and grab, which is sometimes essential when outdoors around rocks or slippery banks. They are also robust and haven’t snagged, but equally warm.View image in fullscreenTwo Bare Feet neoprene 5mm wetsuit socks£15.99 at Two Bare Feet£17.99 at AmazonThese neoprene socks have a decent grip bottom with a textured sole for hobbling over pebbles and gritty waterbeds, yet they have the flexibility for proper swimming while keeping your toes warm.Swim hatView image in fullscreenLomo neoprene swimming cap£18.01 at Decathlon£19.99 at AmazonA bright hat is best in open water as you can be seen by other water users and safety support. I like something a little warmer than a standard cap to avoid brain freeze: this pink one is ideal as it covers not only the head but also the ears, and the chin strap keeps it in place.Swim maskView image in fullscreenAquasphere DefyUltra swim mask£115 at Aquasphere£116 at DecathlonDuring winter it’s common to stick to heads-up breaststroke, as the cold can be uncomfortable around the neck and skull (less fleshy parts always feel the cold more). But I do like to get my head in and do some proper swimming, so the best way I beat face freeze is to wear a swim mask instead of goggles.Not only is visibility better with a mask than goggles, but it covers more of the face and forehead, preventing the cold ache. These are an expensive choice and I was dubious when I first tried them, especially as I looked like I should be on a ski slope. But the ultra-thin silicone is soft yet snug, and the field of vision laterally and vertically is brilliant. That also means you don’t have to lift your head as much and you can master better technique when sighting in open water.TowelView image in fullscreenEbbflowcornwall Logan hammam towel£33 at Mountain WarehouseAny old towel will do really, but I prefer hammam towels because they dry more quickly than others. They’re often 100% cotton, which is good if you’re mindful of microfibres in wild places; they can double up as a scarf or shawl; and they come in beautiful colours. Cornish brandEbbflowcornwallhas different thickness hammam towels, which means you can get thicker for winter and thinner for warmer seasons.View image in fullscreenMatador ultralight travel towel£29.95 at WildboundsAn alternative is a quick-drying nanofibre towel: this is brilliantly big to wrap around your body but packs up small.Changing matView image in fullscreenZone3 changing mat£20 at Zone3£20 at DecathlonWinter swimming often means wet, muddy or icy conditions. A changing mat is essential for protecting not only your clothes as you change, but also your feet from the cold as you wobble about on one foot trying to pull on your socks. This mat doubles up as a drawstring bag into which you can throw all your wet gear.Warm hatView image in fullscreenFinisterre fishermanbeanie£35 at FinisterreIf you’re a heads-up swimmer in winter, you could wear this woolly hat both in and out of the water. While it’s been debunked that welose most heat from our heads, they’re still more sensitive to temperature and there’s something in keeping as much of ourselves as warm as possible when cold-water swimming. Something made from natural fibres such as wool will be best, because they can still keep you warm even when wet.View image in fullscreenVoited Hat in the Clouds£39 at VoitedThis has a warm fleece lining and an eco-friendly Ripstop fabric exterior that repels water.Tow floatView image in fullscreenDippy wild swim tow float£21.99 at Dippy£21.99 at Mountain Warehouseskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

Tow floats in their simplest form are bright, inflated devices tethered to you, with a strap around your waist while you swim so that they float behind you to make you visible in the water. They’re not life-saving devices, but can be used to rest on in the water and offer extra buoyancy for cleaning goggles or chatting with swim pals.View image in fullscreenSwim Secure wild swim bag£37.99 at Swim Secure£29.99 at EtsyThis inflatable dry bag has shoulder, waist and chest straps.

Look for something adjustable with different storage spaces, a wide opening, decent capacity and a compartment for wet kit. This bag was designed by a swimmer – so it is, of course, ideal.Robe orcoat?View image in fullscreenAlpkit Solaceparka£249.99 at AlpkitThere are so many changing robes on the market, all offering and claiming different benefits, and I often get asked if they’re worth the money or even needed. On the one hand, robes are great at keeping the elements off while you fumble about changing under them, or good for warming up after swimming with multiple other layers. On the other, a decent waterproof coat will do just as good a job of keeping you warm and dry before and after swimming. It’s always better to remove wet gear, dry off and layer up after a cold swim than to stand about, still wet under a big change robe. So I would choose a well-insulated, waterproof coat, longer than a jacket that covers your lower back and thighs.View image in fullscreenVoited 3-in-1 Wearever jacket£199 at VoitedAlternatively, get a robe that works like a coat. This is ideal because you can wear it as a jacket, vest, or both for warmth. It’s also weatherproof.Base layersAfter cold-water swimming, it’s all about drying and dressing quickly in layers so you can warm up effectively by trapping air and retaining heat between fabric. A thermal base is a great place to start, and something merino wool-based will wick away any moisture while keeping you warm. Smartwool classic merino base layers are ideal, since both the bottom and top are effective yet sleek enough to wear under my other clothing.View image in fullscreenSmartwool classic thermal merino base layer crew£105 at SmartwoolView image in fullscreenSmartwool classic thermal merino base layer bottom£105 at SmartwoolView image in fullscreenMerino women’s top and pants set£59.99 at Mountain Warehouse£59.99 at AmazonSocksView image in fullscreenFinisterre original wool sock£15 at FinisterreYour body will continue to cool even when out of the water, and your toes often take the longest to warm up.

The creation of RyanDylan and Rian Lennon, who also play two of its main characters, it began life as a 14-minute film – small but perfectly formed – that premiered at the BBC Two comedy festival two years ago. Now, with cast nicely broadened and content nicely deepened, it has become a series. We follow the three “emotionally unassembled” twentysomethings – Callum Brown (Dylan), Jordan McCafferty (Lennon) and Lorcan Boggin (Lee R James) – whose earnestness belies their self-chosen funboys moniker, as they attempt to assemble and entertain themselves with the sparse resources on offer in the tiny town of Ballymacnoose, Northern Ireland.Callum is no longer engaged to his ultra-religious fiancee Morgan (Emer O’Connor), but the gang is disturbed and astonished when an English girl, Gemma (Ele McKenzie), arrives in town and promptly makes Callum her boyfriend. “Strong, rugged, good-looking,” she tells him. “I’m sick of that rubbish.” Jordan quickly gets very drunk to cope with his friend’s absence from their group gaming sessions. “I’m worried about Callum’s post-nut depression,” he insists. “I don’t want that for you, Callum.”I must pause here to give Gemma and McKenzie their due. I haven’t seen a character written or performed with such fearless monstrosity since Julia Davis was last on screen. The masturbation scene on a swan pedalo in the middle of a lake in apark is nightmarish, but the kissing that precedes it may actually make you temporarily blind. Unspeakably, brilliantly awful.Let’s move on. Lorcan, who amounts to the group’s philosopher king – perhaps thanks to his familiarity with life’s entrances and exits from his work on the Boggin family’s artisanal abattoir (“We look them in the eye”) – offers Jordan solace away from the bottle. But the wheel of fate continues its cruel turning, and soon Lorcan has replaced Callum in Gemma’s bananas affections and the group must reconstitute once again. On top of which, poor Callum must face the wrath of a park caretaker every time they meet in the supermarket: “You killed seven of my ducks with your jism.” Forgive the pun, but this is a difficult situation to row back on.Funboys shares some DNA with This Country, with its fiercely naturalistic portrait of even smaller town life, shot through with moments of pure surrealism. It also explores the difficulties of young people managing their frustrations, or even identifying that they are frustrated in the first place. Limited opportunities and narrow horizons bedevil the trio just as they do Kurtan and Kerry, and they don’t even have a friendly vicar on their side. But the three-man setup also allows a little light commentary on modern masculinity too, as the boys navigate Jordan’s neediness, Lorcan’s unexpected sexual prowess (at least as far as Gemma is concerned) and Callum becoming the enraptured mentee of Boggin Sr, who promises to teach him how to become one of “the bastards who rule the world”. A natural-born doormat, Callum begins to assert himself at home and at work. “When you didn’t clean your cereal bowl this morning,” Boggin Sr says with pride, “I knew something had begun to shift.” “I did my time in nice-guy prison,” says Callum. “I ain’t going back.”Funboys won’t be to everyone’s taste and that’s fine because it is patently not trying to be. But if you like your comedy gentle yet harrowing, charming yet brutal, light but insidious, these are the guys, and the Gemma, for you.Funboys aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionTV comedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

She might appreciate you wanting to show you careEvery week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a problem sent in by a readerAnnalisa BarbieriFri 14 Feb 2025 09.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 11.44 ESTShareI am in my 30s andthe middlechild of three sisters. We don’t see one another that often as we liveacross the UK, but try to speak regularly and meet up a few times a year.I have always seen my older sister as more of a mum figure as our mum was explosive, cold and critical (we all have very little contact with her now). However, over thepast few yearsour relationshiphas becomemore strained. Ultimately, I miss the closeness we had, but I’m also concerned for her wellbeingas she seems so stressed and overwhelmed.She has two young children, and theeldest has some challenging behaviours. My sister is great with them, but she has a very tense relationship with her partner.I feelthat tensioncontributes to her older child’s anxiety.I don’t think she’s coping, but I feel helpless as tohow to give her supportas shedenies she needs any. My younger sister stays out of it butagreesshe is stressed and takes this out on others. I would like to help her, but how?I went to UKCP psychotherapist Lisa Bruton whose first thought echoed mine: “Zooming out a bit and trying to get a gauge of the broader family context, I wonder whether your sister was the ‘parentified’ child within your family – that is, placed in a parental role and took on the emotional responsibility for her two younger siblings. She may not have been adequately mothered and did not have an older sibling to do that for her.”Bruton went on to explain that parentified children “can often be excessively self-reliant and also resentful, especially if they become mothers. This is not something for you to fix, but it might offer context.”She also pointed out that you may need to readjust “to the fact that your sister is not an ideal parental figure but actually a flawed peer who is vulnerable herself.”I understand you are keen to support your sister. Bruton said it is important to think about how and where you contact her: “So often the tone and intention of something sensitive like this can be lost in a message, so it might be more useful to have this conversation face to face.” Or you could write her a letter, which will give her time to digest it.Set boundaries around in what context you see your sister … maybe you could connect in a different wayTry to meet up, just the two of you, away from other family and children. Bruton suggested “maybe connecting in a different way, by doing something fun and lower stakes together.”Given your concern for your sister (with, it seems, good reason), when you talk to her think about how you broach the subject. Bruton said: “If your sister shuts down the conversation you might want to gently probe further and say something like, ‘I am concerned for you, can I tell you a little about why that is?’”Maybe no one has expressed concern for your sister for a very long time. Bruton thought maybe “toxic patterns of behaviour have become normalised for her and her partner, and she can’t see how tense and unpleasant the atmosphere around her has become.” Given you’ve also expressed concern, in your longer letter, about her partner, we thought it would be an idea to check in with him, too.Bruton also felt “it would be really beneficial for you to be the stable, loving aunt present in your nieces/nephews’ lives. So many of my clients with less than ideal parents have found solace in such relationships, so if you could maintain a strong relationship with her children (through cards, voice notes etc) that could be very valuable to them.”Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

Not for me, anyway. I’ve been doing it for eight years and it’s just in my soul now.” And yet this week, Haworth became the first UK chef to win aMichelin star for cooking only plant-based food.Plates is small, with just 25 covers. There are two sittings but it is full until the end of April. The phone is always engaged, and they can only cope with reservations today and tomorrow. For everything else, send an email.“It’s been like this since we opened – we had 76,000 people trying to book, and the website crashed,” he says. The restaurant opened a few months after he won the TV show Great British Menu. “I’m not sure anyone’s reviewed it yet because they can’t get a table.”View image in fullscreenPlates, near Old Street in east London, was awarded a Michelin star this week.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe diners, then, are diehard Haworth fans, and come in two sizes. The couple next to me have been waiting nine months for a table (it only opened in July), while a man waiting for the loo says he enjoyed his meal but had been brought by a friend “and had no idea what this place was”.Except for the two City guys discussing salaries at the bar, people have travelled from outsideLondon, take photos of the outside but rarely of their food, and are noticeable for being dressed up rather than well-dressed. Hoxton is, after all, the ground zero of scuzzy hipsters, and this is an unusual location for a Michelin-starred restaurant – being just off the Old Street roundabout, and down the road from east London’s more storied Turkish and Vietnamese restaurants.It used to a be a restaurant/bar that closed after the pandemic – as did about 14% of restaurants in central London – but it was a vegan one, suggesting there is something in the filtered tap water.To the food. It is a tasting menu, but a generous one. Among Haworth’s favourites is a dish of slow-cooked leeks that comes crowned with a handful of frozen verjus (pressed unripe grapes). He also likes the barbecued mushrooms.View image in fullscreenKirk Haworth talks Morwenna and her guest through the slow-cooked leeks, chestnut cream, jalapeño and gooseberry dressing with frozen verjus.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianBut it is the ones that should, by rights, be meat that stand out. A lasagne that feels like lasagne except made from mung and urad beans; the whole thing is then served – as if to remind you, again, of what it is not – with a thumb of cucumber. Then there is bread, or rather, a bread-ish croissant rolled into a swirl and served with green “butter” made from cashews. Asked why the non-butter butter is still called butter, Haworth says simply: “Butter is a perception.”Nowhere on the menu is the word “vegan”. Nor “plant-based”, “dairy-free” or even “cow-lite”. “Look, I hate imitation,” he says of the now popular fake meat and cheese market. Although beetroot has an uncanny ability to mimic beef, the meat and fish are not so much doctored as completely swapped out.‘No one wants to pay $25 for breakfast’: US restaurants are cracking under inflationRead moreEverything here strikes a balance between casual and assiduity. Even its name, Plates, betrays nothing except that there will be a lot of them. The semi-open kitchen, which has that monastic serenity you only get when food is not cooked to order, is surrounded by a chef’s counter made from four felled London trees.Customers sit on mustard banquettes, the large Holiday Inn opposite hidden by cafe curtains. There is only one loo, but it has a huge basin carved from polished rock. The Michelin inspectors described it as cosy rather than cramped. But what looks cosy, in other words, is actually more posh.In the truest three-figure Michelin tradition, there are some at-table sauce pouring performances. Plumes of dry ice fog hover over some dishes and you are told which cutlery to use, and in which order. The mocktails – including the “yuzuade” – are fun but unnecessary. And some of the textures – some teeth-squeaking puffed rice – are a little overwhelming. Then there is the price – £90 before you’ve had anything to drink, which feels a little mighty for vegetables. Still, there are enough single diners dropping £150 to remind you this is a destination.View image in fullscreenThe house laminated sourdough bread, with whipped spirulina butter, Maldon salt and Kabocha squash and ginger soup.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianThe Michelin system is not what it used to be. According to areportby University College London, starred restaurants are statistically more likely to close down than highly rated venueswithoutthe accolade. At this week’s ceremony, there were fewer new one- and two-star restaurants compared with last year, and only one three-star addition. But that does not mean it is not difficult to get one. “I’d like to say it’s harder to get a star with plant-based food, but I’ve cooked both and it’s hard all round,” says Haworth, who trained at the French Laundry, which is famous for its oysters and caviar.The meal is finished with a cacao gateau covered in raw caramel. This is the dish that won him the Great British Menu. As such, it is twice the size of everything else. When it first opened, there were three desserts on the menu. When they drop a course, it is the risotto that makes way, not the rice pudding.Though Haworth concedes the current food system is not sustainable, it was only after being diagnosed with Lyme disease that he explored a plant-based diet, finding it helped mitigate the symptoms. “But that’s just me. Most of the people who come in aren’t vegan. I’d say 99%. That must show you something.”Explore more on these topicsVegan food and drinkVeganismFoodRestaurantsLondonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was stuck but not really motivated to look for something else. Then I was made redundant at the start of lockdown, aged 50, which in all honesty suited me. I’d had enough of dealing with the corporate hoo-ha.I increased the amount of proofreading I had been doing and found work with two publishing houses. I have since started working for a literary festival, which is my dream job.Life is significantly better since the pandemic. I work from home, which allows me to fit my life commitments around my work: an elderly parent, a sick daughter, grandchildren, and study. I’m in the fortunate position of having a husband who now also works from home, working full-time, so my wages are merely to top up the household accounts. I turn 55 next month and will be taking a lump sum from my pension.If the pandemic taught us anything, it is that life is too short. Enjoy it while you can!Jo Barlow, 54, a freelance proofreader and administrator from Cornwall‘I live in a rural location and I’m quite isolated’I was generally happier before the pandemic. My last child left home in 2020. I started working from home and now very rarely go into the office. I live in a rural location and I’m quite isolated. Financially, I feel much worse off. The cost of living is difficult, my gas and electricity has just gone up again.Virologist Wendy Barclay: ‘Wild avian viruses are mixing up their genetics all the time. It’s like viral sex on steroids’Read morePolitically the world is a worrying and scary place. I don’t like working for the government, but at my age I’m not in a position to change careers. The department I work for is a shambles and career opportunities have disappeared. Lots of staff are seriously disillusioned. I’m just trying to hold out till I can afford to retire, there’s no way I will last till I’m 67 but financially I’m going to be taking a risk.I experienced social anxiety during the pandemic and am still slowly getting back to normal. This is not helped by working from home. Everything changed with the pandemic and this country is a worse place since, although Brexit has a great deal to answer for as well.Jane*, in her 50s, a civil servant from the south-west‘Memories of our pre-pandemic life keep haunting us’The pandemic made us crave more space. We lived in a great ‘up and coming’ part of south-east London, where many of our friends lived too. In many ways, it was the perfect 15-minute city spot. Anything we wanted – from local bakeries, cinema, a sports centre to fantastic transport links and friends – was within walking distance.The pandemic changed it all. Most of our local friends moved out. Some abroad, others to a different part of London, and so did we, in search of some space and a garden.Now, five or so years after we moved, we’re finally beginning to find our feet in a new, less charming part of London that offers none or only some of the benefits of the old area. We have some fantastic neighbours and have made some friends locally too.Life seems less hectic, more “adult”, more mundane, but in some ways also a bit more uncertain. On the one hand, being 50-plus gives us more freedom to be ourselves, rely on our wisdom and care less about what others think. On the other, there’s more talk of “retirement”, “ageism” and “cancer” whenever we meet friends our age.There’s a scar somewhere – basically, memories of a happier past. Questions about the move and memories of our pre-pandemic life keep haunting us.It was a definite shift: turning 50 during the pandemic, moving to a new location, losing touch with the people we knew, surviving the pandemic itself. It takes time to get used to.Mike, 54, an online publishing professional from London‘I have a slower, worthier lifestyle’Life is good and events aplenty but, thankfully, less rushed. I retired from full-time work at 56. I had a break, then did part-time work for four years. Now I volunteer in a local bookshop.The pandemic was a strange experience, but also a time for reflection. I have maintained a slower but worthier lifestyle since, so now I am more satisfied than pre-pandemic, despite having less disposable income since retiring.A 63-year-old retired care and social worker from Northumberland‘I have to work at remaining joyful’View image in fullscreenValeria, from Hornchurch in Essex, on a family holiday in Scotland last summerBefore the pandemic I drove a car, was out every day, and fit and healthy. I got lots of exercise through normal daily activity as my grandson has been living with me from birth and kept me busy, and mixed with lots of people. I was never lonely.Covid completely changed our lifestyle. Since Covid, I put on weight, 2.5 stone (16kg), and started to become physically disabled. My right leg had dragged a bit before Covid, but then my back and left arm started to hurt more. My activities were centred around home, and I’m indoors now all the time. I’m a trip hazard and now use a wheelchair to go out.My grandson and I bought a cat, which has been really good for me because I have been quite lonely at times. I do miss people. Some of my friendships have stayed online now as my “silver surfer” friends have become computer literate, out of necessity, through the pandemic.Covid was terribly isolating and quite a traumatic time. I now have to work at remaining joyful, and I was definitely happier pre-Covid.Valerie Clapham, 71, a retired authorised Church ofEnglandlay preacher from Hornchurch, Essex‘Covid depleted my savings and my business’I lost most of my savings to get through the Covid era, as I could not work for many months. I also haven’t been able to build my piano lessons back up to what they were.Creatively, I lost five years and the music business is now much tougher. This is depressing and I’m having to come to terms with it.I find myself consciously withdrawing from socialising and travelling as I can’t afford either. I’ve also been engaging less. I’ve never had any social accounts and my pessimism aboutthefuture (in contrast tomyfuture) is now much stronger.I’ve only ever had a modest income so have never taken part in the “consumer society”. I don’t have any hobbies or memberships. I’m lucky to live in an affluent city which still supports cultural and educational provision. I suppose my main worry is my health and the fact I wouldn’t be able to afford to pay for emergencies. My quality of life has definitely deteriorated.Andrew, 75, a musician and piano teacher from Oxford‘The pandemic has definitely knocked my confidence’View image in fullscreenSue Davies was made redundant in 2020 after nearly 30 years in the same workplaceUp until my 60th birthday, I was very satisfied with my life. I had a good job which was well paid, my family were happy and healthy. In January 2020 I was told I was going to be made redundant due to a buyout of our company. I’d worked there for nearly 30 years and was quite upset for myself and my team – we were very close. I am quite a sociable person.When I left work I was relieved as it had been a very intense six months and I felt ready for a break, but also apprehensive about the future and fearful as to whether a cure for Covid would be found. I followed the news each day and became very angry at the government. I suppose suddenly my happy, safe world was being turned upside down and I felt helpless, which I now know affected my mental health.Five years later, I feel that I’m no longer as satisfied as I was. I never returned to work as the pandemic has definitely knocked my confidence. I now tend to overthink things, constantly worry about the health of my family. You could say that instead of feeling satisfied I am now scared, and often feel invisible. Thankfully, I’ve got a lot to look forward to, but I lost myself in the pandemic.Sue Davies, 64,a retired operations manager from Cambridge* Name has been changed.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusOlder peopleHealthCommunitiesMental healthEnglandWork-life balancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its creator and star talk wigs, unfinished business – and what it’s really like being queer in Jamaica todayEllen E JonesFri 14 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareYou’ve probably never met anyone quite like Millie Black, the detective protagonist of a new Jamaica-set crime thriller. ButMarlon Jameshas. James is the acclaimed author of five novels, including 2014’s Booker prize winner,A Brief History of Seven Killings, and now he’s making the move into television, as Get Millie Black’s creator – with a disputed source of inspiration. “I keep telling my mother it is not based on her! She thinks I’m in denial,” he tells me down the line from his art-filled Brooklyn apartment.James’s mother, Shirley Dillon-James, was “a pioneer”, he admits: one of the first women to make detective in 1950s Jamaica, “so she was basically working for the queen. She dealt with colonialism, sexism, all of that stuff.” Jamaica gained independence from the UK in 1962, but the “colonialism” and “sexism” parts still figure for Millie Black as she negotiates a career begun in London’s Metropolitan Police, and now transferred to the Kingston Central Division. But also: “Millie may be more influenced by me than by my mom,” says James. “In the sense that I’ve always looked at writing as a form of detective work. It’s always been, how am I gonna solve this mystery?”Ultimately, it is neither the writer nor his mother who will for ever be associated with this instantly iconic TV cop. That honour goes toTamara Lawrance, who stars as Millie – and she couldn’t be happier about it: “If this became the thing I’m known for, I’d be so thankful,” she says. “It really changed my life.” The series opens with a flashback to Millie’s childhood in Jamaica, and the close sibling bond that was severed when their mother sent her to London to live with relatives. Now back in Jamaica for more than a year, Millie is attempting to rebuild family ties and, in the meantime, has become close to her detective partner, Curtis (Gershwyn Eustache Jr), a gay man who must keep his sexuality secret from the rest of their colleagues.View image in fullscreenOfficer politics … Tamara Lawrance and Joe Dempsie in Get Millie Black.Photograph: Des Willie/Channel 4/HBOLawrance was raised in north-west London by her Jamaican mother and always felt connected to her roots through food (“I grew up eating dumpling, callaloo, corned beef and rice – all the staples”) and music (“My mum was a big fan of Sizzla Kalonji, Capleton, Queen Ifrica, Buju Banton”). Still, the show’s shoot was the first time she’d been to Jamaica since she was a toddler and it had a profound effect: “My mum has always been very open and warm, people gravitate to her, and when I went to Jamaica, I saw that in almost everyone I encountered,” she explains. “I felt a lot of who I am sort of synthesise, […] to see that this might come from growing up on an island, not having to be ‘a Black person’, but [in a place where] you form your identity around your personality, rather than your skin colour.”It was also Lawrance’s bone-deep understanding of the nuances of British-Caribbean identity that helped land her the role. She’s so good as Millie Black – competent but fallible, assertive yet vulnerable – you could easily believe it was written with her in mind. In fact, there was a lengthy casting process, says James. “I don’t even think I knew who she was; we were seeing so many people. Then the casting director sent us this video and I’m like: ‘Oh my God! It’s Millie!’” Lawrance wore a shoulder-length, straight-hair wig to audition, “which is not what Millie would wear at all”, but her innate Millie-ness shone through. “Because, more than anything else, Tamara didn’t need cues as to when to switch to Jamaican.”He’s referring to Millie Black’s blend of British-accented English and Jamaican patois, a fairly common way of speaking in many British-Jamaican households. “It was a relatively instinctive choice for me, because of who I understood Millie to be,” says Lawrance. “Somebody who is trying to reintegrate herself, but is ultimately going to be perceived as foreign in Jamaica.”Rapid code-switching is just one of the ways Get Millie Black explores its central theme: the knotty, centuries-old, back-and-forth relationship between Britain and Jamaica. James is a Jamaican national who now lives in the US, where Get Millie Black aired to rave reviews on HBO Max at the end of last year. But “the primary relationship [for Jamaica] is still the UK”, he says. “My Aunt Enid lived there, my Uncle Oscar lived there, my Aunt Pearl lived there … and my Uncle Errol was literally on the Windrush.” That is, the HMT Empire Windrush passenger ship, which landed on British shores in 1948, and became synonymous with postwar Caribbean immigration.View image in fullscreenGender agenda … Chyna McQueen and Tamara Lawrance in Get Millie Black.Photograph: Channel 4“That Steve McQueen series, Small Axe, hit hard because so many of my family went through it, and yet at the same time so much of that world was totally foreign.” The popularity of the London-originated lovers rock reggae sub-genre, for instance. “They have this big moment where everybody’s singing [Janet Kay’s 1979 UK hit] Silly Games, like it’s a major anthem. Me and the other Jamaicans were like: ‘Do you know that song? I’ve never heard of it …’”Even growing up in Jamaica in the 1970s and 80s, studying Shakespeare and Dickens at his prestigious all-boys high school, James felt the influence of the erstwhile “mother country”. “The first time I came to London, I realised I sounded like the butler, because of the English I learned … So why the UK? Because there’s unfinished business.”Namely, the transatlantic slave trade and its legacy, which finds contemporary parallels in the international human-trafficking case Millie and Curtis stumble into. “The slave trade never really ended,” says James. “Yeah, sure, it’s a reverse trade; now we’re going to Europe instead of the quote-unquote ‘colonies’, but it’s still people being trapped. It’s still people being tricked. It’s still people being forced to do things they don’t want to do.”In the show, when Scotland Yard catches wind of Millie’s investigation, they send out a white British detective, Luke Holborn (Joe Dempsie), to assist. Or should that be “take over”? Millie’s relationship with him is occasionally collaborative but mostly antagonistic, an aspect of the writing Lawrance particularly appreciated: “We see a lot of Black characters on TV, especially British TV, that assimilate,” she says. “I don’t think we see very many Black characters that are very pro-Black, in a way that hasn’t become cartoonish or comedic. But Millie is, and she doesn’t give a heck, really, what this guy thinks about her. In terms of what those two characters represent in world history, that’s a very powerful thing.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Though this, it has been argued, is itself a legacy of British colonialism.) Through the character of Hibiscus, an impressive performance from trans Jamaican actor Chyna McQueen in her first screen role, Millie is connected to the Gully. This is the local nickname for the storm drains below Jamaica’s New Kingston financial district which, until recently, provided refuge to a real community of LGBTQ+ people. Nowadays most of the former “Gully Queens” have moved on, says James. “Jamaica has come a long way with homophobia – I speak as a queer Jamaican who is there all the time. At the same time, trans women don’t feel safe. A lot of the trans women, including in our cast, have already fled.”Meanwhile, back in the UK, Lawrance, who also identifies as queer, sees Get Millie Black as part of an exciting effort to diversify the stories told about Black Britons on screen, alongside another of her recent, acclaimed projects,Mr Loverman. “You know, I’ve never seen love and relationships explored with that sensitivity or honesty before on British TV,” she says of the BBC adaptation of Bernardine Evaristo’s novel about a closeted Antigua-born Londoner reaching crisis point. “And likewise, I’ve never seen Chyna McQueen on TV before, y’know?”Even within Get Millie Black, multiple perspectives are included, a technique readers of A Brief History of Seven Killings will know well. Also characteristic of James’s style is the deep appreciation for Jamaican music, evident from the opening bars of the theme tune, a new mix of Shanique Marie’s Ring the Alarm that is surely destined for the UK charts (“No, but listen, what a banger!” says Lawrance).It all adds up to a cop show that depicts Caribbean culture with a thrilling intensity still too rarely seen on British television. The anti-Death in Paradise, if you will? James, personally, has nothing against that long-running cosy crime drama, set on the idealised island of Saint Marie. “I think Caribbean comfort food is always welcome,” he says, diplomatically. But Millie Black? She would definitely insist on a little more hot sauce.Get Millie Black is coming to Channel 4 next month.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaMarlon JamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Also: would President Putin like to keep the table? I get the feeling that Hegseth would be very willing to throw in the table, which is likely to be hewn by Saudi craftsmen. That’s not a bone-saw euphemism: Trump says the putative peace talks could be hosted by the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. For now, the world had to settle for Hegseth popping into a Nato defence ministers meeting in Brussels to announce: “Make no mistake, President Trump will not allow anyone to turn Uncle Sam intoUncle Sucker.” So this week offered an opportunity to watch Eisenhower quotes get Disneyfied by a defence secretary with a Crusades tattoo. Good times!Anyway: the peace plan. I expect this lesson is contained in Trump’s seminal business text, The Art of the Deal, but one fairly reliable principle of negotiation is that if you say a number first, you end up negotiating down from it. If you get the other side to say a number first, you can negotiate up from that. For whatever reason, and supposedly before formal negotiations have even begun, Hegseth has already effectively surrendered most or all of the land taken by Russia since 2014, the possibility ofUkraine joining Nato, and the threat of any future European security being guaranteed by the US. I image Vladimir Putin will simply accept the terms by pointing at him and saying, “You’re hired!”This wasn’t the exact way Hegseth billed it in his scene-stealing turn on the eve of the Munich security summit, going instead with the assertion that Trump will be “the perfect dealmaker at the table”. As mentioned, the president’s going to lose the table, but so what? Like he cares. Ever since he got much of a country to kayfabe that he won an election which he definitely lost, he must have known it will be a piece of piss to get them to agree he pulled off the most elegant peace treaty of all time. That, really, is the art of his deal. Also, he hasbone spurs.Other interested parties should be engaged in far deeper self-laceration. I kept reading and hearing yesterday about how European leaders were left “in shock”, “reeling” and “blindsided” by the US gambit, but … how? What did they think was going to happen? The signs have been spelled out for more than a year by Trump, who said he was going to end theUkrainewar on day one of his presidency – so if anything he has been slow in pulling the rip cord. Furthermore, I wouldn’t say Hegseth was hard to read. In fact, as indicated, you can quite literally read him. He has a US flag enmeshed with an assault rifle on his bicep, and a number of handy clues to his strategic thinking emblazoned, in writing, down both his forearms.View image in fullscreenFrom left, Winston Churchill, Franklin D Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin at the Yalta agreement talks, February 1945 – an image unlikely to be replicated by Keir Starmer, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.Photograph: PA NewsAs far as mealy-mouthed statements you’d struggle to fit on a forearm go, hats off to the German foreign minister for responding to Trump’s move on Thursdayby declaring: “It is now crucial for us Europeans to make it clear what is important for our own peace.” Now? Hate to be the bazillionth person to point it out, but “now” feels a bit late for Europe to finally get its multiple-cheeked backside in gear on this front. Europe has spent years – diplomatic technicalese ahoy – dicking around and not acting to prepare for the possibility of the US withdrawing support.Shortly after Putin invaded Ukraine three years ago, EU leaders met at Versailles. You would think that this particular location would be sufficient to crystallise the minds of those present in a spirit of “let’s not cock this one up”. And yet. No one could have accused what emerged from Versaillesthattime round of going too far. Despite the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announcing that while Versailles 1919 divided Europe, Versailles 2022 wasbringing it together, that couldn’t meaningfully have been said to be the case. Instead, and unsurprisingly, the declaration that emerged from that meeting found Europe retreating into its happy place of fine words and forever consultations.The US has sold Ukraine down the river – and shown Britain what ‘America first’ means in practice | Gaby HinsliffRead moreAnd here we all are. Nobody but the US administration and Putin is in their happy place, with Ukraine in the unhappiest place of all. Asked whether it was equal partners with Russia in these high-handed negotiations over its own future,Trump replied: “Hmm, that’s an interesting question.” Which I guess is your answer. Not only is Ukraine not in the driving seat, as various people keep mildly observing, but it may well not even be in the car, condemned at best to run along after it, and at worst to be run over by it.In terms of where the UK stands in all of this, the answer increasingly feels like “nowhere particularly”. This morning, Keir Starmer was assuring Ukraine’s president by phone that his country was on “an irreversible path” to Nato membership. Hmm. Meanwhile, Hegseth was on the ground in big-spending Poland saluting it as “the model ally”. The UK’s ego has long been writing cheques its body can’t cash – and certainly that its chancellor refuses to cash. Starmer looks about as likely to make a modern-dayYalta photowith Trump and Putin as he is to be revealed as Dressed Crab on the Masked Singer. As for Trump, he’s never going to get a tattoo.

Netanyahu is exploiting thatJonathan FreedlandWhen I visited Israel this week, it seemed time had stood still since 7 October. I saw pain and grief, but little sign of hopeFri 14 Feb 2025 12.45 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 13.02 ESTShareYou could giveDonald Trumpthat Nobel peace prize right now. For a few days, he succeeded in uniting Palestinians and Israelis, though not quite in the way favoured by the judging panel in Norway. Instead, he had both sides holding their breath, hoping he was not about to destroy the closest thing to hope they have known in 16 months.I am referring to the deal done nearly four weeks ago which has allowed for a ceasefire in Gaza, along with the phased release of hostages held by Hamas and prisoners held by Israel. It was alwaysperilously fragile, but this week it looked to be on the brink of collapse. First came a Hamas threat to postpone the next release of three hostages, due tomorrow, in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire. ThenTrump weighed in, saying that he no longer liked the deal brokered by the Biden administration anyway, that he’d had enough of hostages freed “in dribs and drabs” and wanted all of them out in one go, by noon Saturday. Otherwise, he said, “all hell is going to break out”.That sent a tremor through Palestinians currently returning to the flattened ruins of their homes, who feel hell broke loose for them long ago. But it had a similar effect on many Israelis, especially the families of those still held captive in Hamas’s dungeons, who desperately want the current arrangement to hold at least until they get their loved ones back.Journalists cannot enterGaza, but I was in Israel this week and saw for myself at least the latter half of the equation. When I reported from there a few weeks after the 7 October attacks, I was struck by how time seemed suspended, how frozen the country was in the terror of that day, when at least 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. That remains true today. For Israelis, it’s still 7 October.What has kept so many of them stuck is the wait for the hostages’ return. It might be the Tel Aviv skyscraper lit up with the number of days of captivity – it will be 500 on Monday – and the message “All of us are waiting for you”, or the stickers and posters of their faces plastered on street corners and bus shelters. Either way, anxiety for their plight hangs heavy in the air.It gained a new urgency after the release last Saturday of three male hostages, each one visibly emaciated. The sight immediately struck a nerve that lies close to the surface of Israeli society: I heard the three referred to asMuselmänner, thename Auschwitz prisoners gave to the walking skeletons among them.It has prompted a terrible fear for the captives still held, one deepened by the assumption that Hamas hasrepeated the move it madeduring the first round of prisoner releases in November 2023: namely, givingextra rations to those due for release, to fatten them up for the cameras – that, in other words, the three who came out last Saturday were in an even worse condition before. That has left the hostage families in the no man’s land between hope and dread: hope that their father or son will come out, dread at the state they’ll be in.I spoke to Effie, whose 50-year-old brother, Ohad Yahalomi, was taken on 7 October. She closed her business and became a full-time campaigner for his freedom; she can think of nothing else. “It’s like an open wound that you cannot treat until this is over.” She cannot move on till he is back, and in that she is like much of her country.But beyond dread, there is rage. The manner of the hostages’ release has inflamed yet further the loathing Israelis feel forHamas. The staged handover ceremonies, in which dazed captives, many of them held underground for many months, are dressed in fatigues and made to pose for propaganda images had already set Israeli teeth on edge. But last week saw a masked Hamas gunman put a microphone in front of returning hostage Eli Sharabi, encouraging him to say he was looking forward to seeing his wife and teenage daughters. What Sharabi did not know, but his captors surely did, was that his wife and daughters were murdered on 7 October.0:48Trump warns 'all hell is going to break out' if Gaza hostage deadline not met by Hamas – videoAll this is feeding an implacable fury that has several consequences. The first is that many of those Israelis who prided themselves on their empathy and would once have been part of the peace camp – which had deep roots, incidentally, in the very kibbutzim that felt the full force of the 7 October attacks – now have little or no room in their hearts for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli media rarely show the devastation Israeli bombardment has wreaked on the strip; most Israelis don’t see what the rest of the world sees. They know that thousands have been killed, but they put the blame squarely on Hamas, which surely knew what it was unleashing on 7 October.These are the sentimentsBenjamin Netanyahuso expertly plays on when he promises Israelis the complete and imminent elimination of Hamas by military means, leading most observers to conclude he has no intention of moving to the ceasefire deal’s second phase. He wants the war to resume, and for cynical reasons: because if the war continues, his far-right coalition members stay onboard, keeping him in the prime minister’s chair and out of jail. (His trial on corruption charges is ongoing.)What’s more, a new phase would not simply pick up where Israel left off. The esteemed military analystAmos Harel warnsthat “particularly intense warfare is planned this time, along with a siege on parts of the strip”. With a green light from Trump, who says he wants toempty Gaza of its peopleand turn it into a US-owned beach resort, Netanyahu would embark on a “very aggressive”, two-month operation that would, Harel writes, culminate in “the forced expulsion of Palestinians”.There is some opposition to the plan within the Israeli military, not least because it all but guarantees the deaths of the remaining hostages, but surely the only lasting way out of this nightmare is a change in the leadership of both Palestinians and Israelis. This week, I met Yair Golan, the new leader of what was the Israeli Labor party, now rebadged as the Democrats. A former general, Golan is hailed as one of theheroes of 7 October: that morning, he put on his old uniform, drove south and saved several young Israelis fleeing the Hamas men who had been mowing down hundreds of people at the Nova music festival.Golan speaks robust good sense. He castigates Netanyahu for wanting to keep Israelis in a constant state of emergency and anxiety, says Israel has nothing to fear from a long ceasefire and believes that, ultimately: “It’s not enough to fight the military wing of Hamas. Equally important is to provide an alternative to Hamas.” Only when “a young Palestinian” can see the path to a better future that does not involve violence will Hamas be truly defeated.In the Israel of 30 years ago, Golan would be a deservedly serious candidate for prime minister. But for three decades, Israeli politics has been dominated by Netanyahu: he is the tree in whose shade nothing grows. His outriders and media allies have created a “poison machine” that destroys all challengers. And much of the Israeli public struggles to see through the anger, pain and grief that descended on 7 October and which has barely lifted.Those who want change have to hope that Netanyahu has erred by tying himself to an erratic, if not unstable, US president abroad and to extremist allies at home, and that is too combustible a mixture to last. I badly want that to be right. But I also know there’s a reason why hope has always been the Middle East’s scarcest commodity.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Captain of the Matildas, she became a household name – and the inspiration for children across Australia – as she led her team to victories during the 2023 Women’s World Cup.She is a well-loved and well-resourced woman of colour at the peak of her career. Yet despite all of this, she was stripped of her agency by authority and dragged through the courts in a case that should never have proceeded.Imagine how this plays out for the thousands of women of colour who don’t have Kerr’s platform, financial resources or legal support. Many wouldn’t have had the means to fight back. Many wouldn’t have been believed.From the moment the allegations against Kerr surfaced, public scrutiny here and in the UK was quick and in many cases unforgiving. She was called aggressive, racist and her actions immediately criticised without context or understanding. But history shows us that men in sport – and society – are given far more leeway. We’ve seen male athletes do far worse, yet they are granted second, third and even fourth chances. Kerr was put on trial.Men are more likely to be allowed to make mistakes. Women – especially women of colour and women who don’t conform to passive, demure stereotypes, who do not bow their head meekly and apologise – are often punished. And, as many commentators have previously noted, it is far harder for women to recover from public shaming than men.Sam Kerr will not face disciplinary action at Chelsea as coach says apology ‘enough’Read moreIn Australia, the more you fit into what society sees as “white”, the closer you are to power – and with this proximity to power you’re assumed to be credible, respectable, and deserving of protection. The further away, the more likely you are to be questioned, scrutinised and disbelieved.This case exposes just how little racial literacy exists in public discussion, and how important this kind of learning is in institutions. In Australia, we see this in the ongoing targeting of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who face disproportionate rates of incarceration and harm within our legal system, and how Indigenous women are also often misidentified as perpetrators of family violence.We need a deeper understanding of how gender and race go together to create injustice in legal systems. The commission’s proposed National Anti-Racism Framework focuses on the importance of understanding how different forms of discrimination overlap. It would improve education about race and racism, and ensure police receive proper anti-racism training.This case played out in the UK but the broader issues are equally relevant in Australia: it showed example after example of systemic racism and sexism: Kerr being patronised as “little missy” while a white man in power failed to recognise his privilege; two queer women corroborating each other’s testimony and yet their voices being dismissed in favour of one man’s. No acknowledgment of the fear experienced being locked in a car by a man – despite the very real threats these situations pose for women.We know that women’s experiences, especially women of colour or queer women, are routinely ignored or minimised by legal systems. Kerr – by her own admission – did not handle the situation well. But would she have been charged if she were a man? Or white? Or straight?Women already face so many legal barriers when it comes to speaking up against discrimination or violence. Statistics show that women do not report violence against them, partly because they don’t trust how the system will deal with them.It forces us to ask who really has access to justice in systems which still centre white men’s experience.In the end, credit must go to the jury – a diverse group of everyday people who heard the evidence and found her not guilty. This case is a reminder of the importance of juries that reflect the real world, rather than systems of power designed to uphold privilege.Power and privilege shape who is believed, who is punished and who gets justice. Until we dismantle these systemic inequalities, cases like this will continue to happen – not just to high-profile women of colour like Kerr, but to those whose voices are rarely, if ever, heard.Dr Anna Cody is Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner and Giridharan Sivaraman is Australia’s race discrimination commissionerExplore more on these topicsSam KerrOpinionRaceGendercommentShareReuse this content"

Where once it was Jane Austen being busted – albeit posthumously – for making bitchy remarks in a letter about her neighbour’s miscarriage, now we enjoy the spectacle of two Labour MPs and 11 Labour councillorsbeing suspended for comments made in the WhatsApp groupTrigger Me Timbers.That’s right, Trigger Me Timbers. The clue, as they say, is in the title, making the shock-horror of some of the group’s non-contributing members an amusing case of: what exactly did you think you were joining? Some choice remarks made by suspended members include, “the public are arseholes. I know, I’ve met them”, references to a constituent as a “grade-A wanker”, and speculation about the possibility that a non-Labour voting pensioner might “croak” before the election.It’s definitely awkward, although still several leagues less fraught than the A-list version of this phenomenon – the Sony email hack of 2014 – in which Amy Pascal, the then head of the studio, was revealed to have called Leonardo DiCaprio “despicable”, theproducer Scott Rudin called Angelina Jolie “a minimally talented spoiled brat”, and, more deliciously, “a camp event”, and the writer Aaron Sorkin furthered the opinion that no one had ever heard of Michael Fassbender (wishful thinking).Anyway back to the spicy Labour WhatsApp group, which is thought to have contained about 44 people, many of whom have scrambled to condemn the unearthed remarks as “completely unacceptable”. Those feeling unfairly maligned because they lurked without posting should, clearly, henceforth limit themselves to groups called things like Pothole Subcommittee and We Love Local Gov.TuesdayAnother updated version of an old classic: mislaying your bitcoin fortune as the new lost lottery ticket, except much worse because bitcoin numbers are so improbably huge. (Also: there is no central bitcoin authority to appeal to.) This week, a man in Wales whose girlfriend mistakenly threw away his computer in 2013 has been trying to win access to Newport landfill to recover the hard drive and what’s on it: the only copy of a 51-character passcode to a digital wallet containing bitcoin now worth £598m. Bummer!Newport council, rather stingily, turned down his initial request to go dumpster-diving in the tip’s 1.4m tonnes of waste, holding firm even when Howells offered to split the value of the bitcoin with them. This week a high court judge sided with the council, leaving Howells with one final move. As the council announced the closure of the landfill,Howells proposed buying the entire siteafter talking to “investment partners” willing to go in with him. I guess they’ve run the numbers and are betting that data recovery from a hard drive – even one that has marinated in bin juice for more than a decade – has higher odds of working out than buying a lottery ticket.View image in fullscreenThe king demonstrates Britain’s highly prized ‘can’t throw a ball’ prerequisite for male leadership.Photograph: WPA/Getty ImagesWednesdayThe odds of a new stage musical taking off, meanwhile, are at least as small as finding a needle in a landfill site. The improbable success of theWest End musical Operation Mincemeatwas cemented last week when it transferred with the original cast to Broadway, but I turned up at the theatre with low expectations. The already well-told story of the British wartime intelligence wheeze that got one over the Germans all sounded a bit ‘Allo ‘Allo! to me.Anyway, I was totally wrong. I loved it so much I’ve been listening to thetrack Dear Billon a loop ever since, have gone down a wormhole on the gestation of the show and its obsessive fans known as “Mincefluencers” – musical theatre people are like dogs with a bone (remember Rent) when they decide to commit – and wondered about the secret ingredient that sent this show over the top. Most new West End musicals are spinoffs of 25-year-old movies that sound as if they’ve been written by AI or, worse, Elton John (I love Elton but he shouldn’t be allowed to write musicals). This show is funny and silly and sharply put together but the key ingredient is the one thing you can’t fake: real heart.ThursdayYou can’t, as they say, get the staff these days, a truism as deeply felt by the Sicilian mafia as any other organisation with HR problems. Transcripts from wiretaps placed by the Sicilian police this weekrevealed that what remains of the Cosa Nostraconsists of a bunch of guys sitting around bemoaning the state of job applicants pursuing a life of organised crime. “The caliber these days is low, a miserable level,” said mob boss Giancarlo Romano, who was one of 150 alleged mafia members rounded up in dawn raids.“If you watch The Godfather,” he went on, “the connections he had … he was very influential because of the power that he built at a political level.” Like hacks dreaming of the hey-day of All the President’s Men, Romano despaired, “but us – what can we do? We’re on our knees, guys.” He advised young people to look elsewhere for a career, perhaps in medicine or the law among “the people who run Italy, Europe”. Sounds like he needs a good therapist.View image in fullscreen‘I have a full range of them for every occasion.’Photograph: Jim Watson/AFP/Getty ImagesFridayI’m clinging to my 40s by the merest 10 months, but perhaps there’s no need to worry. A new study from University College London reassures me thatover-50s in England enjoy greater life satisfactionthan they did five years ago and are broadly happier than before the pandemic. Is it happiness? Or is it a state of low-fret living brought on by general exhaustion? Either way, I’ll take it.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekLabournewsShareReuse this content"

This is a nakedly authoritarian moveFri 14 Feb 2025 09.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 12.39 ESTShareDonald Trump’s announcement that he wasinstalling himselfas the chair of the John F Kennedy Center, Washington DC’s temple to the performing arts, might have been mistaken for something petty or trivial – another random, Pollock-esque splatter of the policy paintbrush against the canvas of the world. On his favoured social media site heposted an image, presumably AI-generated, of himself as a dinner-jacketed orchestral conductor – the macho maestro of the US. But this is more than personal: it is political, and points towards the president’s wider project.To understand what is going on, it is necessary to consider Trump’s favourite European authoritarian,Viktor Orbán. Hungary’s prime minister has chipped away at his country’s constitution and judiciary. But a no less powerful tool has been his attention to parts of society often regarded as unimportant compared with a country’s constitution. Alongsidecrushing independent media, Orbán’s government has co-opted the arts, appointing right-leaningdirectors to theatres, and instigating nationalistart exhibitions. Orbán understands that culture creates the climate for emotion and memory, imprints national myths, and – often intangibly – acts on politics.The Kennedy Center is low-hanging fruit for Trump, in that he has some direct power over it. Trustees arepresidential appointees, and federal funding is allocated for the upkeep of its building. It was founded as a bipartisan institution, and has normally had a mix of political views on its board – but that principle is capable of being abused, and it is being so right now. A statement, emphasising this bipartisan history, appeared and then vanished from the centre’s website this week. Over the past few days, board members have been fired and 13 compliant ones – including Usha Vance, the wife of the vice-president, JD Vance – appointed. The president of the centrehas been sacked, and a new interim (and unqualified)executive director announced: the foreign policy adviserRichard Grenell. “NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA”, was Trump’s salvo. (The centre had staged a minuscule number of events featuring drag acts, among the vaster diet of Shostakovich, Beethoven and Stravinsky.) On Wednesday, Trump was formallyvoted inby the board. “Unanimously”, his social media post said: a nice Putin-esque touch.“There’s no more woke in this country,”Trump told reporters. On Thursday morning, the entire Kennedy Center website was down, with “technical difficulties”.Other federally supported institutions such as the National Gallery of Art and the Smithsonian Institution, DC’s consortium of national museums, are also vulnerable. After Trump’sexecutive orderof 20 January,they have saidthey will be closing their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) offices. It’s a similar story with the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), the federal body that offers funding to arts organisations. A document that I have seen warns that NEA arts grants now need to be reviewed for the presence of “certain ideological terms”, including “climate change”, “environment”, “immigrant”, “lesbian”, “gay”, “trans”, “drag” and even “equal rights”. Applicants are being told that patriotic proposals relating to the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence will be prioritised. The NEA is a very different entity from Arts Council England. It does not give revenue funding for organisations – it has a limited budget that offers support to individual projects. Nevertheless, it is a respected body, and it has just received a full-fronted ideological assault on its operations.These are some of the direct results of Trump’s first three weeks. Indirect consequences will take longer to crystallise. US arts institutions rely on corporate sponsorship, but corporates who want anything from the government are moving smartly in line with Trump. The administration has insisted that the stop on DEI initiatives must also be observed by government contractors. Among such firms is the consultantBooz Allen Hamilton, which had long boasted of its inclusive policies for LGBTQ+ employees. In the past few days it haswithdrawn its sponsorshipfrom this spring’s WorldPride in Washington DC. Again, webpages have simply vanished, or, in the case of a PR agency connected to Booz Allen Hamilton, remain ghostlike in the form of404 error messages.The speed and extremity of these measures is sending Washington reeling. There is the bizarre prospect of Trump exerting hispersonal programming ideason the national performing arts institution (will it be the Village People, Kid Rock and Carrie Underwood from now on?) Nothing is too minor for his scattergun attention, after all: an idea for a “national garden of American heroes” was instigated in an executive order of 29 January. I will leave to your imagination the full horror of the kitsch bronzes that might spring up as a result of that initiative.The great bulwark against all of this, though, is the US tradition of philanthropists and trusts as the primary funders of the biggest arts organisations. Few receive federal funds. Powerful foundations such as Getty are – at least at present – sailing smoothly on despite Trump’s agitations: see also powerful grant-giving bodies such as theMellon Foundationand theFord Foundation(the latter’s website still states that “diversity, equity and inclusion are core to our mission and to who we are”). Some of Trump’s measures will be legally challenged. Resistancewill be mountedat the level of the state and the city. Los Angeles and Chicago are a long way, physically and spiritually, from DC.From the perspective of the UK, Trump’s coup at the Kennedy Center may look clumsy, outlandish and an impossibility here. A month ago, though, his actions might have looked impossible in the US. A brief glance at Britain’s recent history should act as a warning. The Tories made aconcerted attemptto pervert independent appointment processes in order to insert ideologically aligned people into positions of cultural power. Their success at so doing, however limited, illuminated the fact that the guardrails of liberal institutions are a tradition of shared values, rather than enforceable rules. The former culture secretary Nadine Dorries blatantly broke the British principle that government should be at arm’s length from the arts when sheintervened in a funding processto insist on her own policy priorities. This looks subtle when compared with Trump’s brash interventions – but it’s a sign of the fragility of the arm’s-length principle and of how fiercely it should be protected.John Maynard Keynes set up what was then called the Arts Council of Great Britain after the second world war for two reasons: to ensure the provision of culture across the country and to protect artistsfrom direct political influence. You needed only look to Germany or Italy, or the Soviet Union, to understand how important that was. EM Forster, in a series of wartime broadcasts, laid out how political and artistic liberty were inextricably connected, and that there would need to be a fresh, postwar struggle “for the restoration and extension of cultural freedom”. As the memory of the war receded, the threat to the arts from fascism looked fanciful and distant. Now, maybe not so much.Where to find hope in all this? I find plenty. Artists – history tells us – will turn out to be the most creative and subversive documenters of the historical moment, and among the most nimble resisters of society’s corruption. Trump will not win this fight.Charlotte Higgins is the Guardian’s chief culture writerExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

And it could be brilliantly transformative for EnglandFri 14 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 10.45 ESTShareLast week saw the launch of what could be – if done right – the most important political policy in a generation. You may not have heard about the newland use framework, but if you did hear something, chances are it wasn’t good. “National suicide!” declared the shadow farming minister, Robbie Moore, who described the policy for good measure as “food lunacy”.I should confess that I am the original author of this lunacy. It was one of the key recommendations of the 2021National Food Strategy– an independent review I was commissioned to write by the then Tory government. The purpose of the land use framework was – is – sane enough. It is intended to inform and streamline planning decisions and steer other government incentives, to ensure that areas of land are used in ways they are naturally well suited to.It will be, in essence, a map: one that contains multiple levels of data about the natural and human geography of England. Anyone – planning official, farmer, developer, householder, renter or merely interested citizen – will be able to use this map. By clicking on a given area, you’ll be able to access detailed information on, for example, local soil health, agricultural productivity, the risk of flooding or drought, carbon sequestration potential, biodiversity, land ownership and tenure, planning records and infrastructure suitability, water resources and pollution levels, or economic land use trends.Land use plan for England to map best areas for farming and natureRead moreA huge amount of this information already exists, but it is squirrelled away in discrete and inaccessible pockets of local or national government. Bringing it together in one place like this will, for the first time, enable every English citizen to get high-quality data about the land they live on, and its potential uses. It will also be – astonishingly – the first time every government department has had access to the same data.And this brings us to its second purpose. The data will be used to better inform and align government policy, across all departments, at a time when using our land wisely matters more than ever.For most of human history, everything we needed – water, food, trees to burn or build with – was on the surface of the Earth, created by the direct action of sunlight on land and sea. Then we discovered millions of years of stored sunlight buried deep underground, in the form of coal, gas and oil. For the past two centuries, cheap energy, synthetic materials and industrial agriculture have driven an unprecedented expansion of human prosperity, and population.But we can no longer afford this dependence on fossil fuels. The climate crisis, geopolitical instability, and the depletion of easily accessible fuel reserves mean we must once again turn to the land to meet our needs. Not only for food and housing, but also for cheap, secure, sustainable energy. We need to grow trees to soak up some of the carbon we have already released into the atmosphere. And we need to reverse the collapse in biodiversity, before it threatens our own survival. Without pollinators or healthy soil micro-organisms, we won’t be able to grow enough food to feed ourselves.All this makes it vital that we use every area of land cleverly, maximising its natural potential. The English landscape is wonderful in its variety: a mosaic of rolling hills, flat fenlands, chalk downs, limestone dales, peat bogs and wetlands, not to mention our huge urban conurbations. Different landscapes are suited to different uses. For example, there is no point building solar farms or housing estates on fertile land that would be ideally suited to farming. Likewise, there are areas of land that are too rugged or infertile to make farming productive. But existing farmers in these areas can’t be expected to diversify into, say, restoring biodiversity or eco-tourism if they can’t get planning permission to convert barns into leisure facilities.The need for joined-up thinking is both obvious and urgent. The Tories began work on the land use framework before the last election, andLabourhas picked up where they left off. Such rare continuity is reminiscent of the 2010 coalition government’s embrace of Labour’s education reforms: an attempt to set aside ideological flip-flopping and do the right thing for the country.Contrary to Moore’s nightmares, this is not some radical leftwing plot to dictate what farmers must do with their land. It is an attempt to bring coherence to land use decisions, which are currently fragmented across multiple government departments, leading to contradictory policies, sclerotic planning processes and widespread inefficiency. At a time when funds are limited, it also makes sense to ensure that agricultural grants and other government incentives are based on the best, most granular information.Land use plan for England to map best areas for farming and natureRead moreThe problem is that this policy has been launched into the febrile atmosphere caused by the mishandledinheritance tax changesfor farmers. This has created huge uncertainty and anger, with many farmers afraid that they won’t be able to pass their farms on to the next generation. Given the relatively small amount of money this measure is expected to raise, it is hard to justify the level of anxiety and political backlash it has caused.People are spooked, so they are seeing monsters everywhere. But the land use framework is not a Stalinist five-year plan. It won’t force landowners to do anything. It will merely create better information and wiser incentives, enabling farmers to make more profitable and sustainable choices about how to use their land. Done right, it should also improve and speed up planning decisions,making it easier for farmers to build new agricultural buildings, renewable energy projects or tourism and leisure facilities. In short, it creates a smarter, more joined-up approach to land management, rather than imposing top-down diktats.This is a moment for pragmatism, not polarisation. The land use framework could be the most important reimagining of how we use our land since the second world war. Back then, the question was stark: how do we feed ourselves in the face of the U-boat threat? Today, the challenge is just as existential: how do we feed ourselves in the face of climate and biodiversity collapse, while boosting economic growth and using the land we have wisely?Without this framework, we will remain mired in contradictory regulations, tangled bureaucracy and reactive decision-making, all of which fail to address our long-term challenges. Success will depend on collaboration, evidence-based policy and long-term cross-party commitment–not political point-scoring. We have to get this right, to secure a sustainable, prosperous future for generations to come.Henry Dimbleby is managing partner of Bramble Partners, which invests in and advises businesses that are creating a sustainable food systemExplore more on these topicsFarmingOpinionRural affairsPlanning policyLabourGreen politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Now it’s time to defend ourselvesJodie GinsbergThe one-time defiance and solidarity of publications across the political aisle is strained as outlets cave to Trump’s threatsFri 14 Feb 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 10.45 ESTShareIn 1971, the Nixon administration asked for a court order to stop the New York Times from publishing further stories about the so-calledPentagon Papers– documents that showed the US government had escalated its Vietnam war efforts even as it was acknowledging privately that it could not win the war. A temporary restraining order – the first time the US press had been restrained prior to publication – was granted.Knowing she could be sued, jailed and could even have faced financial ruin if her own paper followed suit, the Washington Post’s publisher, Katharine Graham, decided that the Post, which had copies of some of the Pentagon Papers, would publish anyway. As immortalised in the 2017 filmThe Post, Graham – who had previously described herself as shy and insecure – took a deep breath and told her editors: “Let’s go. Let’s publish!”Defying the court order was a seriously risky move for Graham. TheWashington PostCompany had gone public just three days earlier. A criminal charge put its multimillion-dollar stock offering in jeopardy. Not to mention that Graham herself could have been jailed or that a criminal conviction could have given the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) justification for stripping the Post of television broadcast licences.How Jeff Bezos can stop the bleeding at the Washington Post | Margaret SullivanRead moreThat decision looks especially brave intoday’s climate, when the new administration led by Donald Trump – who in his first term repeatedly called the press “enemies of the people” – seems even more determined than the Nixon administration to stifle reporting.Today, Graham’s defence of the right of the press under the first amendment to publish news of public interest should be a clarion call for her modern-day counterparts. The US media is, as the judge Murray Gurfein – who issued the Pentagon Papers’ restraining order –noted, “cantankerous” and “obstinate”. But it has also, unlike the media in many parts of the world, traditionally been united against threats to its independence – even when those threats are being made to organizations from across the political aisle.But that defiance and solidarity now appears under strain as outlets cave to politically motivated threats from the new administration.In December,ABC Newssettled a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump for $15m, a case that many media law experts said they should have fought given the high threshold traditionally required for a public figure such as Trump to prove defamation.Now CBS looks like it mightsettlea lawsuit over edits it made to a 60 Minutes interview with the presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which Trump’s team allege had been deceptively edited to cast Harris in a more favorable light ahead of the election. (Editing interviews is standard practice in news reporting to avoid repetition.) Initially, CBS refused to hand over the transcripts but following pressure from the FCC, it sent the raw footage and all transcripts to the agency, now led by the Trump appointee Brendan Carr.Carr has made no secret of his desire to use the FCC’s powers to go after organizations he believes are not fulfilling their public interest mandate; he explicitly linked the CBS case to a deal in which CBS’s parent, Paramount, isseeking approvalto sell 28 of its local broadcast TV stations.A ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to knowJudge Murray GurfeinThe capitulations – on top of last-minute interventions by the owners of both the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times to halt editorial endorsements of either candidate ahead of last year’s presidential elections – are worrying, not least because they send a signal that such spurious lawsuits work to silence the “cantankerous” press.And while the likes of ABC and CBS may have deep pockets to be able to weather such attacks, the vast majority of US news outlets do not. The online non-profit newsroomWasau Pilot & Review, which has a staff of just four, faced bankruptcy after astate senatorsued it for defamation over its report that he was overheard using an anti-gay slur during a county board meeting. In a story headlined “Even if we win, we lose,” the Pilot & Review acknowledged the challenge that faces so many small news outlets – the cost of defending such suits is prohibitive, even if the case is ultimately thrown out. Such legal harassment, increasingly common across the world, can also taint the public’s view (“there’s no smoke without fire”) of the press, further eroding already febrile trust in the media.Non-profit newsrooms are particularly worried. A call hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) last November, in the weeks following the election, was attended by representatives from more than 100 non-profit news outlets throughout the United States, eager to understand what vectors might be used to challenge their reporting.Their caution is warranted; local press is already severely weakened. A 2024 report from researchers at Northwestern University found that more than55 million Americanshad limited or no access to local news – the kind of information that shows how local tax dollars are being spent, what decisions local school boards are making, or even how your local sports team is doing. Repeated academic studies have shown astrong linkbetween the amount of local political coverage and voter turnout. Local media proved vital in covering recent extreme weather such as theLos Angeles wildfires.When Gurfein denied the Nixon administration’s request for a preliminary injunction, he stated: “A ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know.” If vital media institutions are to survive this administration, it will be because essential media, on all sides, stand up clearly and unequivocally for the right to report the news. After all, challenging the bullies is part of the job.Jodie Ginsberg is CEO of the Committee to Protect JournalistsExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionUS press and publishingWashington PostNew York TimesNewspapersNewspapers & magazinescommentShareReuse this content"

But sometimes we should pause to celebrate – to feel genuine awe – at the wonders that we have seen. Amid all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the last half century, we have witnessed nothing short of a miracle.Vaccination, in addition to clean water, sanitation and improved nutrition, has been one of the greatest contributors to global health. It is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59% between 1990 and 2022. It has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants,sincethe Expanded Programme on Immunisation was launched by the World Health Organization in 1974. Initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. Then, in 2000, came the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), a public-private organisation that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs.The results have been remarkable. Prevention is better – and cheaper and easier – than cure. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. Almost all the worldis now polio-free. Cases of many other diseases have been slashed. Much more can be done: an estimated 5 million children have beenprotected against malariasince routine vaccinations were launched a year ago. And from a scientific perspective, we are enteringa golden age of vaccines.Yet this is a dangerous moment in other ways. The climate crisis is spurring disease outbreaks. Conflict has dramatically increasedthe number of unprotected children. Vaccinescepticismhas grown. Now cuts to funding threaten to turn the clock back. The trashing of USAid will hinder delivery and hashalted a groundbreaking programmeto create new malaria vaccines. Robert F Kennedy Jr – who once claimed that “no vaccine is safe and effective” and who tried to persuade the US government to rescind authorisation for the coronavirus vaccine at the height of the pandemic – wasconfirmedthis week as health secretary.Now the UK, one of Gavi’s founding donors and the country which has given most to its core programme, is consideringa significant cut to its support. This would be a grave error. While some aspects of Gavi’s approach have faced sensible scrutiny in the past, it has vaccinated over 1 billion children and done so cost-effectively: 97 pence in every pound it is given goes on vaccine programmes. Its success is also evident in the number of countries which have graduated from being beneficiaries to paying their own way; some, including Indonesia, are becoming donors in turn. And Gavi’s stockpiles help to keep people safe in wealthier countries too, as well as ensuring that poorer nations are healthier and more stable.For all these reasons, Gavi has long enjoyed bipartisan support in the UK, which has given it more than £2bn over the last four years. Now, more than ever, its funding must be sustained. The world is full of apparently intractable conflicts and complex moral dilemmas. Few decisions are truly simple for governments. But this one is a no-brainer. It should astonish us that we can so easily save lives. It should be self-evident that we must continue to seize that opportunity.Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationOpinionHealthWorld Health OrganizationChildrenClimate crisisUSAidUS politicseditorialsShareReuse this content"

As the awards season is upon us, this instruction goes to the heart of a question that has been asked behind the scenes – should we still have separate best actor and actress categories?Or are they exclusionary and outdated? There’s no Academy award for best female sound engineer.Last year,Variety magazine reportedthat the Academy was considering eliminating the separate awards, following the example of the Grammys in 2012 and other film and TV honours since, but that this was still in early “exploration”. The arguments in favour are that this would put male and female actors on an equal footing and include non-binary actors. The case against is the danger of fewer or no women at all being nominated: the Brits’ decision to combine the best solo artist awards in 2022 was immediately followed byan all-male shortlist.Like the ceremonies themselves, dazzling parades of beautiful women in lovely dresses, the focus on the acting gongs obscures a less pretty reality elsewhere. It is no small irony that the only film written and directed by a woman that is up for major awards at theBaftasthis Sunday and theOscarsnext month isCoralie Fargeat’s The Substance, a body horror movie satirising Hollywood’s treatment of women. Last year, Barbie was nominated for best picture, but not,controversially, its director, Greta Gerwig.In the Oscars’ 96 years, only three women have wonbest director. No woman has ever wonbest cinematographer, and only one best visual effects. These statistics are shocking, and partly reflect the underlying problem. Of all the films entered into the best director category at the Baftas this year, fewer than 25% were by women. As theBafta chair, Sara Putt,said: “We cannot dictate what is being made… we’re at the end of that talent pipeline.”Film is not the only creative industry wrestling with these issues. This weekthe longlist for the Women’s prize for non-fiction, now in its second year, was announced. Its sister prize for fiction has been dogged by charges ofspecial‑pleading and irrelevancesince its inception (as the Orange prize) nearly 30 years agoin response to 1991’s all-male Booker prize shortlist. The late AS Byatt refused to allow her novels to be submitted on the grounds that the prize was“sexist”.Yet the Women’s prize has not only amplified and celebrated books by women, but books about women. Awards not only signal which individuals are valued, they also highlight whose stories are considered most culturally important. As Samantha Morton said in hermoving Bafta fellowship award acceptance speechlast year, “Representation matters ... the stories we tell have the power to change peoples’ lives.” According to this year’s favourites (nowEmilia Pérez is out of the running) –Conclave,The BrutalistandA Complete Unknown– these are still by and about men.Oppenheimer swept the Oscarslast year.At a time when women’s rights are being eroded across the world, the visibility and recognition of female artists is more vital than ever. Diversity in every sense should be better represented across every category. Everyone wins when talent is fairly recognised, but that will require change not only in awards but across the film industry.Explore more on these topicsFilmOpinionOscarsGenderFeminismInequalityWomenGrammy awards 2025commentShareReuse this content"

The mystery behind the best UFO picture ever seen, G2, 11 February). And, as in the US, any hope for imminent and trustworthy disclosure about what these objects may be is probably futile.Those who do nota prioriconsider this topic ludicrous, or exploit it in a sensationalist manner, are increasingly taking a more nuanced and independent approach. If there are such phenomena, it stands to reason that they can and should be studied with the necessary rigour.The unspoken implication is that at least a small proportion of these sightings may relate to what is called NHI – non-human intelligence. If that were to turn out to be true, the consequences for our worldview as the human species would make the Copernican revolution pale into insignificance. Serious research is more than warranted.I recommend Robert Powell’s new book,UFOs. It is a highly readable and scientifically solid introduction to the field of UAP studies. Your readers may also be interested in the interdisciplinary international symposiumGrounding the SETI and UAP debateat Durham Law School on 24 April. It has taken astronomical research into SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) many decades to lose its stigma as pseudo-science and a reputation-wrecking endeavour. The same needs to happen for UAP research.Prof Michael BohlanderChair in global law and SETI policy, Durham Law SchoolAs the person who first analysed the Calvine photograph for Dr David Clarke in June 2022, I am perhaps more familiar than most with the image. We should always remember there is no proof of where and when the Calvine photograph was taken, or who the photographer was. An Teampan mountain above Calvine is the most likely location, based on the original witness statement. However, we do not yet have an exact match. Dr Clarke’s team hastraced someone with the same nameas that on the back of the photograph, but they deny all knowledge of the incident.The available evidence suggests that the print and negatives were not “disappeared”, as some have suggested, but simply returned to the photographer or newspaper as theMinistry of Defenceclaims. What has disappeared is the original typewritten witness report faxed to the MoD by Craig Lindsay, along with the analysis produced by its image analysts, the Joint Air Reconnaissance Intelligence Centre.There isno credible evidenceto support Sean Kirkpatrick’s suggestion that the photograph is the reflection of a rock in a lake, nor is it an image ofa mountain top peeking through low-lying cloudas the MoD suggests. It should be noted that in 1992 British intelligence shared the photographwith the US Department of Defense,which undertook its own analysis. It would be interesting indeed if these missing documents were to be located and released.The Calvine story remains open for believers, sceptics and other interested parties to provide their own interpretations, and in this way a contemporary folklore of competing narratives has grown up around the image.Andrew RobinsonSenior lecturer in photography, Sheffield Hallam UniversityThis is the level of reportage and analysis that the public is crying out for on “the phenomenon” (a catch-all phrase to cover the whole gamut of data, collected over eight decades, relating to something potentially non-human among us). More please. A series of articles would be very welcome: on Berwyn Mountain, Broad Haven School, Rendlesham Forest and more. Data is not evidence, and is certainly not “proof” of anything, but it must be gathered and interrogated properly.Aideen CartyDublin, IrelandDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

This does a huge disservice to the many excellent female fantasy authors – some recent, some around for decades – who have been a mainstay of the genre despite not writing romance or teen fiction.These women do not seem to get the recognition, and readership, that they deserve – despite some, such asNK Jemisin,Ann Leckie,Charlie Jane Anders,RF KuangorMartha Wells, dominating genre awards. These authors also have to fight the continual misperception that they only write romantic or young adult fiction, which is exactly the fantasy that your article perpetuates. And this also erases all the female fantasy readers who are not (solely) here for the romantasy, and have always been here.While I am glad that romantasy has sparked more interest in fantasy fiction, made the genre more inclusive, and made fantasy publishing more lucrative (though usually for the publishers rather than most authors), perpetuating the myth that the (non-romance) genre is only for boys – and that romance is only for girls – is unfair.Sorry to have to mansplain this to you, but from what I’ve seen the writers themselves are too tired and appalled at having to continually wage the battle of the sexes to take up arms once more. Dragons are easier to defeat, it seems.James LatimerSwindon, WiltshireLike most genres, romantasy is nothing new. Readers ofAnne McCaffrey’s Dragonflight(1968) and subsequent Pern novels will immediately recognise the synergy of dragons and sex. Beowulf fans will see this resurgence as a sellout, even dragon-sploitation. But times move on and the sagas once popular with the male warrior class have to make way for the commercially dominant female consumer.Perhaps it’s time then to throw off the snobbery that dominates newspaper reviews, especially if editors want to attract new younger and female readers. Critics might be more widely read if they were more fully conversant with achievements in this massively popular genre.After all, the bestselling genres of the past, such as gothic novels, have made it into the canon and serious scholars are discovering literary merits that contemporaries must have overlooked.Yvonne WilliamsRyde, Isle of WightDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

City and the league asked for further deliberations regarding the effect these aspects would have on the rules more broadly.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That answer has now been given, with the tribunal saying: “The three respects in which the APT rules and amended APT rules were unlawful cannot be severed with the result that the APT rules as a whole are void and unenforceable.”The ruling could open the door for clubs who had APT deals rejected under the original rules to seek compensation from the league.The league has authorised a new set of APT rules in the interim and those rules are not directly affected by the judgment. The league believes it has dealt with the concerns raised by the tribunal in its redrafting, butCity have challenged the new rulestoo and the same tribunal is to adjudicate on their suitability in the coming weeks.If the new rules are also adjudged to be unenforceable it will almost certainly occasion a crisis of confidence in the league’s ability to function, at the same time as the verdict on the 130 disciplinary charges brought against City is anticipated, and plans for an independent regulator for the game come close to completion in parliament.In a statement on Friday the league asserted the validity of the new rules. “The league continues to believe that the new APT rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter,” it said. “The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to thePremier Leaguefor fair market value assessment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The protest banners. The chants. It is a scene we are familiar with, the anti-Daniel Levy movement, mobilised on the High Road outside the stadium he built, and we are about to see it again.The last time was before thePremier League game against Liverpoolon 22 December and there were a couple of hundred there, along with the obligatory rubber-neckers, including the photographers who filed their pictures back to the news desks. It is amazing how the tight-angle shots come across. The tourists got out their cameraphones. Of course they did.Amorim admits Manchester United will have to sell before they buy in summerRead moreThe organisers gave away black balloons, with Levy Out written on them, and the idea was for people to release them in the 24th minute of the game. The black was for doom and gloom; the number for Levy’s 24-year chairmanship.Did anything happen? It was hard to make out a coordinated display. Luis Díaz had put Liverpool in front on 23minutes and maybe that drew the focus. Then again, there was the sight of what looked like a couple of dog-poo bags blowing around the pitch for the remainder of Liverpool’s 6-3 win. The realisation would dawn; they were burst balloons. Either way, there was a metaphor.Spurs had entered the game in 11th place. Four weeks earlier, with the team 10th,Ange Postecoglou had saidthere would be “a lot of scrutiny” on his position as the manager if they remained there at Christmas.The club are 14th before Manchester United’s visit on Sunday and Postecoglou has indeed been questioned. He has overseen the collection of seven points from 11 matches.Spurs exited the Carabao Cupand FA Cup last week at Liverpool andAston Villarespectively. They are still alive in the Europa League and that is huge for Postecoglou. Just as important has been his mastery of the narrative around his injury-ravaged squad.View image in fullscreenA banner protesting against Daniel Levy and Enic, the major shareholder in Spurs.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesThe biggest takeaway during games from their horror run has been the lack of supporter calls for Postecoglou to go. There was mockery at Villa Park last Sunday for how badly his team played in the opening 20 minutes. But the diehards do not blame him in the first instance.They blame the man who asked Postecoglou to manage for so many weeks with threadbare resources, especially throughout January when the transfer window was open. They blame the man who they believe has not gone deep enough with his investment in the squad, the lone constant from the past 24 years as managers of all profiles have come and gone with only one trophy delivered –the 2008 League Cup. They blame Levy.It is the Change for Tottenham action group that have organised Sunday’s demonstration. The plan is for fans to gather at 2.45pm where Lordship Lane meets the High Road and march peacefully to the ground. After the full-time whistle, there is to be a sit-in protest in the South Stand Lower. “This is about passion, pride and protecting our club from greed-driven failure,” the group said. “To make it clear to the board that enough is enough.”If previous actions have been underwhelming, it will be interesting to monitor this one because feelings are running high and the club have arguably never been lower in the Levy era. The 2003-04 season was a disaster under the caretaker manager David Pleat, who stepped in afterGlenn Hoddle was sacked in late September. The team were never higher than 10th, grubbing around in the lower reaches of mid-table for most of it before ending up 14th. It was early days for Levy.There was also the notorious two points from eight matches at the start of 2008-09 underJuande Ramos, which led to the call for Harry Redknapp. At about this time of the season, Redknapp had Spurs 17th but the trends were upward and they would finish eighth.What makes it more frustrating now, more difficult to fathom, is that Spurs are firmly established among the financial elite. According toDeloitte’s most recent Money League for 2023-24– published on 23 January – the club were the ninth-richest in world football with an annual turnover of £512m. This was during a season when they did not compete in Europe. Spurs’s most recent accounts for the year ended 30 June 2023 – published on 3 April 2024 – had shown record revenue of £549.6m.Commercially, 2023-24 was a blockbuster period. The top-line figure of £247.4m was up £19.65m on the previous year and was helped by the stadium’s capacity to stage concerts and other sporting events. Levy has driven this, it is down to his business acumen and there is a part of him that surely believes he has held up his end. It is not as if he has failed to spend on transfers. He has overseen an outlay of £550m in net terms on players since the rebuilt stadium opened on 3 April 2019. Levy cannot play centre-half, the area where Postecoglou has been hardest hit by injuries.Yet there are details within it all, taking in the kind of players bought, their profiles, the bets on potential. A line that damned Levy was provided by Deloitte, the one which showed Spurs’s wages-to-revenue ratio for 2023-24 was 42% – the lowest in five years and a number that was significantly lower than the other clubs in England’s “Big Six”.If you do not pay the top wages, you do not get the superstar players. The 42% spoke to excessive caution, a lack of ambition, feeding the “profit over glory” criticism from protesting supporters. In this context, the optics of Levy’s salary are not great. According to Spurs’s most recent annual report, he received remuneration of £3.581m, plus an accrued bonus of £3m paid across the year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a buyer, agents and financiers have claimed.

He ceased to be a part of the Lewis Family Trust which controls Spurs, transferring it to unnamed members of his family.The 88-year-old Lewis has subsequently endured a well-documented fall from grace. Charged with insider trading in the US on 26 July 2023, he was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $5m (£4m) on 4 April 2024.The Lewis Family Trust owns 70.12% of Enic, the company that holds 86.58% of the shares in Spurs. Levy and certain members of his family own the other 29.88% of Enic. Lewis has two children, Vivienne and Charles, and the family’s interest at Spurs is being looked after by two trustees. Vivienne attends Spurs games but she does not have an input into the day-to-day running of the club.The Guardian understands that the Lewis family are open to selling but what of Levy? He is consumed with Spurs, working around the clock to make them better and push the brand, especially in North America. Could he walk away? Perhaps not, which is why his staying on to run the club under new ownership if there were a sale ought not to be discounted.Postecoglou is focused on the Manchester United match. He has had it circled in his diary for a while, describing it at the end of January as a “point for us to relaunch our campaign”, mindful as he was that some of his injured players would be back.How is that looking? The goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario is poised to return to the starting XI and Destiny Udogie and James Maddison are expected to be in the squad. Brennan Johnson, Timo Werner and Wilson Odobert are back in training. Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, Radu Dragusin, Dominic Solanke and Richarlison remain out.Postecoglou said that centre-half Van de Ven had been to see a biomechanical expert outside the club as they seek to get to the root of his hamstring issue and “make sure his body is better equipped to handle the kind of athlete he is”. Van de Ven – and Romero, for that matter – may have to be patient. It is not a commodity that is in plentiful supply at Spurs.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecogloufeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday it emerged that Ratcliffe is to cut as many as 200 employees, having previously made 250 redundancies in the summer and autumn.On Wednesday it was reported that Ratcliffe is undertaking these and other money-saving measures toavoid the club going bankrupt, after it lost £300m in the past three years. While United are yet to officially confirm the new redundancies, the email suggests this and other matters will be discussed at the meeting.Ratcliffe is being cast as Scrooge but Glazers made Manchester United’s mess | Jamie JacksonRead moreIt says: “We are aware of media reports this week speculating on a number of issues relating to the club. We recognise this is unsettling for you all. In terms of what has been reported there is no further information that we can share with you at this point. However, we will hold a team briefing on Monday 24 February at 2.30pm during which we’ll be able to talk to you further.It will come as no surprise that the club must explore every option, including reducing costs and raising revenues. There are no final decisions currently.”Ruben Amorim has admitted Manchester United will have to sell players before they can strengthen in the summer window due to straitened finances.During the recent window, United could afford only a£25.1m outlay on the full-back Patrick Dorgufrom Lecce and £1.5m on the centre-back Ayden Heaven from Arsenal. While this was possible without sales, Amorim has warned that a summer repeat will not be possible in regard to permanent transfers.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim accepts the club will have to sell before they can add to their squad.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Richard Sellers/Apl/Sportsphoto“Here is simple – to do something we need to sell players,” said the head coach. “We cannot do [signings] now. The window is closed. We need to focus on the games that we have, especially the next one, and then in the summer we will see.”Ratcliffe’s Mission 21 and Project 150 are plans for United to win a 21st league title by the club’s 150th anniversary in 2028. “Yes, we talk about that,” Amorim said.I sense from day one our focus is to win the Premier League, and we can change everything in a few years. I don’t know how long it is going to take.

Of course I have to understand all of these problems but that problem of our club is not new. You already knew the rules of [financial] fair play.“We have a [budgetary] problem at the moment, but that cannot influence the way I coach the team and prepare the next game, so my focus is on that and not the other things.”With Mason Mount, Jonny Evans, Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir absent, Amorim may have more players unavailable for the trip to north London. “Maybe we will have one or two issues, but we are waiting,” he said. “We have one player also who is sick so we will see the team on the weekend. But it was good to work with the team, to feel the players and to try to improve our performance.”Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimnewsShareReuse this content"

But like everything, it will all depend on how well he can adapt to the car and how well he can adapt to the team.”Williams finished ninth out of 10 last season and are still in a process of rebuilding, with their sights set on the regulation changes in 2026 to really enjoy the fruits of their labour. However Sainz, his Thai-British teammate Alex Albon and the team principal, James Vowles, were all confident they had made significant steps forward with this year’s car, and expected to be more competitive in 2025.Albon also noted there was no little disquiet among drivers over the FIA’s recently announced rule amendments that will impose heavy fines for swearing and that may even lead to race bans.“There’s definitely been discussions about it. We’re still ongoing about how we want to set out what we say around it,” he said. “It is a delicate matter – do we think it’s right? Of course not.”The FIA’s stance may lead to confrontation later in the season. The clampdown is understood to have been led by the FIA president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, and last year it provoked fury from Max Verstappen when he was given a community service punishment for swearing in a press conference. The drivers responded by demandingthe FIA treats them like adults.At the Williams launch Albon noted he did not believe drivers should be “monetised” by the FIA. Last season, when they demanded to know where the money from fines was spent, Ben Sulayem said it was “none of their business”.Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He was shown a red card by the referee, Michael Oliver, and faces an extended touchline ban if found guilty.Hulshoff, who received his red card in the tunnel, is also accused of acting in an improper manner and/or using insulting and/or abusive words and/or behaviour towards a match official. It is further alleged that Liverpool’s assistant manager acted in an improper manner and/or used insulting and/or abusive words and/or behaviour towards a match official after being sent off.The two clubs have been charged with failing to ensure their players and/or occupants of their technical areas did not behave in an improper and/or provocative way following the final whistle.Everton, Liverpool, Slot and Hulshoff have until next Wednesday, 19 February, to respond.Speaking before the charges were issued, Slot expressed regret for allowing emotions to get the better of him on Wednesday and said he hopes to react “differently next time”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Dutchman was contrite about his behaviour on the pitch. “I think what happened was that the extra time, the additional five minutes ended up being eight, a lot happened and emotions got the better of me,” he said. “If I look back at it, I would love to do it differently. I’m hoping to do it differently next time. What exactly has been said or what has happened, there is an ongoing process and I don’t want to disturb that. I can’t go into details.”Slot explained that several incidents caused his anger to rise during stoppage time at Goodison, and not only Oliver’s and the video assistant referee’s refusal to penalise the Everton striker Beto for a push on Ibrahima Konaté in the buildup to James Tarkowski’s 98th-minute leveller.“Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional,” he said. “There was a VAR incident for two minutes where he checked. I thought maybe the only thing that could happen was he looked back at the foul. Then I thought: ‘Maybe it’s offside?’ Then of course you hear their fans cheering and you think: ‘OK, it wasn’t offside.’ Many things happened in extra time but, like I said, it wouldn’t be smart to go into every single incident.”Liverpool will be without the suspended Jones for Sunday’s visit of Wolves. Cody Gakpo could also miss out with a foot injury sustained in the derby. Slot intends to speak to Jones about his furious reaction to Doucouré celebrating in front of the Liverpool fans, but backed the homegrown midfielder.“I like a lot that he stands up for the team – for the team and for the fans – but there are other ways to do that maybe,” said Slot. “I will talk with him about that, but it is the same for me. I should have acted differently after the game as well. It’s an emotional sport and sometimes individuals, out of emotion, make the wrong decision. That’s definitely what I did.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotEvertonnewsShareReuse this content"

Her England place at risk, the 27-year-old desperately needed minutes, and a move was the only option. On the evening of 29 January, less than 24 hours before the transfer window shut, Kelly went public on social media regarding her frustration at City dictating “whom I can and can’t join”. Amid reported interest from Arsenal, Manchester United and Brighton, she said it was having “a huge impact on not only my career but my mental wellbeing. Ultimately, I just want to be happy again.”Chloe Kelly left out of England squad but Nikita Parris returns after two yearsRead moreThat public proclamation helped drive through a loan to Arsenal, the club she left aged 20 in search of regular football. She is happy again, she says, and so is her family. Her brother ran upstairs to pull on his Arsenal shirt when told the news that the deal was on. Kelly herself spent the day at the driving range with her husband to try to take her mind off the frenetic talks taking place.The first half of the season was extremely “mentally tough”, she says. “It’s been draining at times. I know I’m a professional and I know I hold myself to a high level, but as a human, it was a tough time for me and I’m ready to move forward.”You might assume that Kelly had felt nervous pressing send on the social media post that would make headlines and further damage her relationship with City but instead she felt a weight had been lifted. “I felt a sigh of relief after I shared my statement,” she says. “It had been a long time coming. I felt relief and I really felt good at that moment. I also felt powerful; as women we should. It was still a dark time for me because I didn’t know how my future looked but the support that I received from that was incredible.”Why relief? “It was a relief that I had spoken out and, whether my move got over the line or not, I was grateful to be able to share my words.”Kelly leaned heavily on friends and family during the tough past six months and “got myself a little puppy”, she says with a grin. “Using people around you is really important,” she says.“But it’s also important to not get too low with the lows and never too high with the highs in this game. In 2022, I wasn’t even training on the pitch with the team at this time of year [during her recovery from an anterior cruciate ligament injury].View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly pokes home the winning goal for England at Euro 2022.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“When I’m at my best I have a smile on my face. Sport isn’t always a journey that goes upwards – there’s going to be some bumps in the road throughout. I was able to bounce back from my injury and this time round I’m hoping my bouncebackability is strong again. I’m a really resilient person so I’m ready for the fight again and I’m ready to show what I’m capable of again.”Winning a place in the England squad for the Euros, after her late winner earned victory in the 2022 final, is the ultimate goal, but Kelly has beenleft out of Sarina Wiegman’s latest squad. “Sarina’s an amazing manager and who I respect so much and I respect what she’s done for English football,” she says. “I completely understand her decision and I’m ready to get good training under my belt, good minutes under my belt, be at the best level possible come the summer and to fight to get my shirt back.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If she makes her second Arsenal debut in the north London derby against Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, it will have been 2,815 days since she last laced up her boots for the side.The manager, Renée Slegers, was cagey about whether Kelly will play, saying: “I look forward to her first minutes for Arsenal and we’ll see when that is.”Kelly’s recruitment is a win-win for Arsenal, who get an experienced England international burning to do well, in a position where they are light.“I’ve always got fire in my belly,” says Kelly. “I always play with my heart on my sleeve and it’s really important that I go out there to be my best every session and every game. It’s just going out there and being happy. That’s how I look at football: it’s my happy place. From when I was a little girl, I just loved the game. Now, it’s important that I show what I’m capable of on the big stage.”The Emirates Stadium has a special place in her memories too. She played there with City at the start of the season but when she walks out in red it will be the first time for Arsenal since she trained there as a girl. “My dad came on the pitch at the end of the session – we took a nice picture,” she says. “That was a special memory. And I’m here to create many more special memories.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenEngland women's football teamWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ilias Chair scored twice, with Koki Saito and Ronnie Edwards also on target on a disastrous first day at the office for the new Rams manager.Eustace raised eyebrows this week by leaving Blackburn, a side challenging for promotion to the Premier League, for one battling against the drop into League One. While Rovers are fifth, Derby’s humbling in west London meant they slipped into the bottom three on goal difference. Eustace certainly knew what was in store for his new side on Friday night, as his final league match with Rovers was a 2-1 defeat at Loftus Road just 10 days earlier.Blackburn risk burnout as Venky’s blunder in waving goodbye to EustaceRead moreDerby had actually started with a lot more purpose than in recent weeks, but that disappeared the moment they fell behind to the home side’s first shot on target. Michael Frey did well to hold the ball up between three Derby defenders on the corner of the penalty area before smuggling it out to Chair. The Moroccan midfielder let the ball run across his body, turned and launched a rocket past the dive of the visiting goalkeeper Jacob Widell Zetterström and into the top corner.Derby could have equalised when a headed clearance dropped to Ebou Adams just inside the box but he blazed the chance over the crossbar and then Frey almost topped Chair’s strike with an even more spectacular effort, but his first-time volley from 25 yards flew narrowly wide.View image in fullscreenDerby’s new manager John Eustace applauds the fans after his team’s defeat at Loftus Road.Photograph: John Walton/PABut moments later Rangers did have a second after Chair pinged a low cross into the area. Zetterström dived out to block the danger but succeeded only in pushing the ball to the feet of Saito, who took a sideways touch before lashing into the roof of the net from six yards.Eustace’s first half-time team talk needed to be a good one, but whatever the message was it failed to have the desired effect. Just before the hour mark Chair had his second, and QPR’s third, when he tucked away a cutback from the Tottenham loanee Yang Min-hyeok.Then Edwards, on loan from Southampton, headed the fourth from Kenneth Paal’s free-kick as Rangers, who could be dark horses for the playoffs, wrapped up a seventh win in eight home outings. A miserable night for Eustace was summed up when his side finally created a decent chance only for Kayden Jackson to stab it over from three yards out.“Obviously I’m really disappointed with the result,” said Eustace after the match. “I learnt a lot about the group tonight, and there’s lots I’m excited about. There is also lots we can improve on.”“I thought we started well but the goal they scored knocked the wind out of our sails. Then we didn’t defend the box well enough for the second, third and fourth goals. I know this group of players is going to fight for every point and the hard work starts on Monday. We’ve got an exciting week ahead on the training pitch and lots to work on.”On the impending relegation battle he faces with the club where he ended his playing career, Eustace added: “I’ve come to Derby not just for the short term but for the long term, and it’s my job now to give as much confidence as I can to the players. You can see they are low on confidence at the moment.”The QPR manager, Martí Cifuentes, said he “liked a lot of things about the performance” as his side bounced back from midweek defeat to Coventry. “We didn’t really know what to expect from them [Derby] but everybody was so committed.“Ilias Chair is one of the best players in the league,” Cifuentes added. “I’m glad he got two goals. He’s a bit angry at me for taking him off because he wanted a hat-trick. We are happy he is playing well.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipQPRDerby Countymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Critics accuse the ICAO of having beencaptured by the industry, resulting in slow efforts to tackle the climate crisis by reducing the carbon emissions from aircraft.The next meeting of CAEP begins on Monday but there is no public information on its agenda or the people who will be running the conference. The ICAO has been criticised for alack of transparencythat contrasts sharply with, for example, the UN’s climate body.The ICAO does not routinely make its meeting documents freely available, instead charging hundreds of dollars for password-protected copies. Neither the media nor the public can attend CAEP conferences, and observer delegates are required to sign non-disclosure agreements that incur “unlimited financial liability”.Flying causes more climate-heating pollution than any other form of transport for every kilometre and is dominated by rich passengers, with 1% of the world’s populationresponsible for 50% of aviation emissions. The industry’s climate plans are rated“critically insufficient” by Climate Action Tracker.The ICAO forecasts adoubling of passenger numbersby 2042, and the industry argues that more efficient aircraft, sustainable fuels and the ICAO’s offsetting scheme can control carbon emissions.Independentexperts saythefeasible scale of such measuresisextremely unlikelytocompensate for such a huge growth in traffic. For example, the “unambitious and problematic” offsetting scheme has yet to require any airline to use a carbon credit andfuel-efficiency improvements are stalling. The experts say aviation growth must be curbed if climate targets are to be met.Lucca Ewbank, the transport lead at InfluenceMap, the thinktank that analysed the delegate data, said: “The level of access and potential influence given to the fossil fuel and aviation industries by ICAO is extremely concerning and risks the capture of global climate negotiations by vested interests.“The [lack of] transparency also works in industry’s favour, allowing them to privately influence climate negotiations and push their vested interests without external scrutiny. Industry appears to have exerted significant influence over environmental negotiations at ICAO, resulting in rules that serve the interest of aviation companies at the expense of science-aligned climate action.”Specific technical information on aircraft discussed at CAEP might be commercially sensitive, one delegate told the Guardian, but secrecy should not be “a general rule that governs everything”.The ICAO did not respond to a request for comment.The big CAEP meetings take place every three years and 439 delegates attended the previous event in 2022. Analysis by InfluenceMap showed that 125 (29%) were from the aviation industry, including at least 16 representatives who attended the meeting as part of their national delegations. The latter included delegates from Saudi Aramco, the United Arab Emirate’s national oil company, Adnoc, and its two national airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates, and from Japan Airlines.The International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Associations, which represents manufacturers, provided the most industry delegates, with 62, followed by the Airports Council International (28) and the International Business Aviation Council (10).There were only 11 delegates from environmental groups. In contrast, at the UN’s Cop29 climate summit, only 1.5% of attenders were from thefossil fuel industry or lobbyists.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

An ICAO “stocktaking event” on aviation emissions reductions in October 2024 was sponsored by ExxonMobil, Shell Aviation, Airbus and the leading trade body for airlines, the International Air Transport Association (IATA).Another ICAO event, onaviation and alternative fuels in Dubaiin November 2023, was sponsored by Adnoc, Etihad, Air Arabia and Boeing as well as Shell Aviation, Airbus and IATA.InfluenceMap’s analysis also linked industry figures to influential positions. Kevin Walsh, now vice-president at the trade body Airlines for America, was listed in the report of the 2022 CAEP meeting as being vice-chair for the next CAEP meeting. In 2022, he was part of the US delegation and worked for the Federal Aviation Administration.CAEP has 11 working groups, whose membership is not made public. However, analysis of LinkedIn profiles indicated industry representatives on these groups. Three people from Saudi Aramco were on the fuel task group, as was one from Adnoc, and United Airlines was also represented on working groups. Staff from industry trade bodies were also on working groups, including some from the Airports Council International and IATA.There have been calls for increased transparency, with an unnamed member CAEP highlighting the need for this, according to the report of the 2022 meeting. Another delegate, also unnamed, said “transparency is the lifeblood of effective governance”, focusing on “improving access, broadening participation, and ensuring accountability”.The US delegationcalled publicly for greater transparencyin 2022, saying this would “improve [CAEP’s] accountability to the public it seeks to serve” and that other UN bodies released all papers for decision meetings publicly and in advance of meetings. No papers appear to have been released before the CAEP talks next week.You can contact Damian Carrington viaemail, Signal (dpcarrington.35) orsecurely via this link.Explore more on these topicsAirline emissionsAir transportClimate crisisAir pollutionAirline industryUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s just climate change, I guess.”But the lack of snow doesn’t mean that their job has got less demanding – if anything it’s the opposite. Last year, their busiest in recent memory, they had 110 callouts.David Gracie, a volunteer of nine years and one of the team’s other deputies, said many of the callouts involved groups of younger people who, pre-pandemic, may not have thought to visit the Lakes.“I guess people can see on the phones and through social media, there’s more stuff going on, and I think they’re keener to get out and go and see and explore, which is great,” he said.However, issues arise when walkers are underprepared or overestimate their ability to tackle some of the more challenging hikes.Often inexperienced hikers will set off too late. One group took the train all the way from Brighton before setting out on a climb the same day, and ended up calling for help in the early hours of the next morning.Their most recent rescue, Farley said, involved two girls who had been using a navigation app on their phone, and called for help from Striding Edge.“We went up and they said they’d seen something on TikTok, and they wanted to go up to the top of Helvellyn, and they didn’t quite make it to the top,” he said. “They got a bit stuck, and then got really scared, and then they called for help. I guess that’s a little bit more typical now.”The fact that almost everyone has a mobile phone within reach means it’s a lot easier to call for help than it would have been in the past, which sometimes leads to people dialling 999 when it may perhaps have been possible for them to find their own way down.Often when the team go to rescue people they also find they have used an unsuitable app to guide them, either in-built phone navigation, or one with crowdsourced information that may provide wildly inaccurate estimates for how long a walk will take.“They just unfortunately rely on their phones and rely on the technology too much, and phones don’t work in the Lake District much,” Barrow said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are unpaid volunteers, with jobs, and many with young families as well.The fear, Farley said, was “if the numbers continue to rise, I don’t know whether it is sustainable in the long run.”Dan Jones is a doctor and a fell-runner – both valuable skills for a mountain rescuer. But he also has two young children, and his wife is 36 weeks pregnant with their third.“I‘m one of the fitter members of the team and I’ve got all my medical knowledge, and you want to get to them all, but you just can’t,” he said. “Sometimes I physically can’t because I’ve got the boys. Or you want to maintain a family and a relationship.”Louisa Rodriguez, a mountain rescuer who also runs the team’s social media account, said: “We all love it, and we all do it because we want to help people, and we love the outdoors, but it’s about that sustainability.”“We have no problem going out,” she said, “but then there are preventable jobs, just because people either don’t know what they’re doing, or they’ve not got the right equipment.”As well as relying on poor technology, often people do not check the weather, especially the mountain-specific forecast, or they attempt a climb in trainers, or without a map, torch or compass.“I firmly believe the outdoors should be accessible to everybody,” Rodriguez said. “Why wouldn’t you want to come to the Lake District? It’s a beautiful place.”But the key, she said, was not to underestimate the mountains – as the consequences could be grave. Last year, mountain rescue teams across the Lakes dealt with 32 deaths.“By all means, enjoy the outdoors,” Rodriguez said. “But just think a little bit more.”Explore more on these topicsLake DistrictWalkingCumbriaFitnessHealth & wellbeingnewsShareReuse this content"

It passed the Commons atsecond readingwith a majority of 55, but some supporters have said the decision to back it again would depend on the results of the amendments stage.In a joint statement after Leadbeater’s full amendments were published, fiveLabourMPs who opposed the bill accused her of having “sprung yet another surprise upon MPs, this time the creation of a whole new body with panels and a distant civil service tsar to oversee assisted dying”.The statement issued by Antonia Bance, Jess Asato, James Frith, Meg Hillier and Melanie Ward, said: “Many MPs were already deeply concerned about the removal of the high court oversight that they voted for.“Now the bill’s supporters are proposing a civil servant should make decisions on life and death, working with a panel that doesn’t have to even meet the patient.”Under the 16 pages of amendments by Leadbeater, the panels would be appointed by a voluntary assisted dying commissioner – a role described as a “death tsar” by critics – who would be appointed by the prime minister.A person appointed to the role would need to be a sitting or former high court, appeal court or supreme court judge. As well as appointing the panels, they would look at possible appeals, and make an annual report on the operation of the act.The amendments also set out that if someone refused an assisted death by a panel believes the decision was irrational, unfair or wrong under the law, they can appeal to the commissioner.Patients can also ask for a panel to sit in private, with the decision made by the panel chair.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesLabournewsShareReuse this content"

This is an incredible step ahead in our ambition to broaden access to society to space.”McFall, who was a bronze medallist at the 2008 Beijing Paralympic Games and is an orthopaedic surgeon, was selected to join Esa’s reserve astronaut corps in November 2022. The initial aim was to assess the medical and technical feasibility of a lower limb amputee participating in a future mission. By the end of last year, Esa concluded it was technically feasible, and McFall has been given the highest level medical certification for a long duration mission, which would typically last up to six months.McFall said it “felt strange” having to prove himself after previously having excelled in professional sports and medicine. “As an athlete … no one questioned it. You have a disability and you’re meant to be elite and awesome at sport. As a surgeon, my disability didn’t matter,” he said. “The thing that surprised me most was all of a sudden I was coming into this environment and being questioned about whether I could do something or not.“I have to admit capability was not automatically assumed,” he added. “In my head, capability is automatically assumed. I hope that I’ve been able to change that mindset a little bit. Unless I say otherwise, assume I can do it.”McFall has previously pushed back on the use of the title “parastronaut”, and said it risks creating an unnecessary divide. “I’m not a para-surgeon, I’m a surgeon. I’m not a para-dad, I’m a dad,” hetold the Guardian.He said thefeasibility study, known as Fly!, ensured Esa was able to secure signoff from international partners working at the ISS, which included the US and Russia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Of course.’”The signoff comes as President Donald Trump ordered a crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and Nasa was ordered toremove all mentions of DEI, including terms such as “accessibility” or “anything specifically targeting women”. Esa has continued to highlight its ambitions of improving diversity, withtwo women out of fivecareer astronauts selected in 2022.“We are now entering a world which is changing a bit from a DEI perspective from one of our partners,” said Neuenschwander. “We have our European values. We will continue with our European values … I see no reason why we would change our approach in this context.”Being a member of Esa’s astronaut reserve, McFall is not guaranteed a trip to the ISS, scheduled to be decommissioned in 2030.Neuenschwander said: “Now he’s an astronaut like everybody else who wants to fly to the ISS waiting for a mission assignment. First and above all there is no showstopper. He’s qualified as an astronaut to fly to the ISS. The main objective for me is to fly all our astronauts … to give them a flight opportunity.”Explore more on these topicsSpaceEuropean Space AgencyInternational Space StationParalympicsParalympics 2008Disability and sportnewsShareReuse this content"

She described Mason as being “psychotic and possessive”, the inquest was told. He sent her more than 1,000 messages the previous month.Appearing in person, Mason, who is now working as a driving instructor, declined to answer questions about his interactions and relationship with Beck.Asked by the assistant coroner Nicholas Rheinberg if he had threatened suicide or self-harm to manipulate Beck into a close relationship, Mason said: “My aim was never … it was not to manipulate or stuff … I don’t know if I had an aim … I can’t remember.”Rheinberg had advised Mason that he did not have to answer questions if his answers were likely to incriminate him. Mason denied asking Beck to sleep with him while they were staying in a hotel in Swindon for an event in December 2021.The inquest was read a message that Beck sent to Mason that day which said: “I honestly feel trapped in this whole situation, I have tried to act as a normal as possible because we are working together but nothing is normal about this situation.“I have tried to be there for you as a friend but it completely crossed the line of that a long time ago. I have felt so uncomfortable at this event, I have literally cried about it and been up worrying about it.“The truth is I am struggling to deal with all this, it’s taken a huge toll on my mental health for many reasons. I need time out.”When asked whether he thought he hoped to get into a relationship with Beck, Mason told the inquest: “I knew there was never a chance with Jaysley.”Alison Gerry, legal counsel for Beck’s family, questioned Mason about WhatsApp messages that he sent to Beck before the coroner halted the line of questioning out of concern for the “mental health” of the witness.Finishing her questions, Gerry asked Mason: “You were Jaysley’s line manager, you were older, she was a young new soldier and your subordinate and it’s right you became completely obsessed with her, possessive, jealous, manipulative and when she split up with her boyfriend, you were overjoyed as that meant you could be together and, when that did not happen, you became more obsessive and manipulative?”He replied: “I decline to answer.”Mason, who left the army a few days before Beck was found dead, after 13 years with the forces, later broke down in tears as he told the hearing that he had suffered from mental health problems since he was a child and had self-harmed in 2015.The hearing continues.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He hit the headlines in 2013 after the Mail on Sunday published secretly filmed footage of him handing over £300 in cash for crystal meth and other drugs in Leeds.In July last year, Flowers pleaded guilty to fraud charges amounting to £100,000 after abusing his position as the executor of the will and holder of power of attorney for a woman named Margaret Jarvis.At Friday’s sentence hearing, the judge was told that Flowers had “disengaged” with his legal team, although a solicitor had contacted him on Thursday night to explain the consequences of not attending court.Judge Dean KC, the honorary recorder of Manchester, issued a warrant not backed for bail.A number of preliminary hearings in the case were previously abandoned when Flowers cited health problems, and in November 2023 another crown court judge issued a similar warrant when Flowers did not appear as scheduled.Dean noted Flowers had “fragile mental health” but that an immediate custodial sentence could be “almost inevitable” for an offence over a sustained period involving a “vulnerable victim”, which he said may explain why the defendant had not attended.The Mail on Sunday story, headlined “Crystal meth shame of bank chief”, was the starting point for a rapid and public decline in Flowers’ fortunes.After it, he pleaded guilty at Leeds magistrates court to possessing cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine and was fined £400.Further tabloid stories followed about his use of drugs and male escorts.He stood down as chair of the Co-op Bank, a post he had held for more than three years, after a £1.5bn hole was discovered in its finances, but before the Mail on Sunday story.Flowers, a former Labour councillor in Rochdale and Bradford, was later banned from the financial services industry after the City watchdog found he demonstrated the “lack of fitness and propriety required” to work in the sector.The Financial Conduct Authority concluded he used his work mobile telephone to make a number of inappropriate telephone calls to a premium-rate chat line and he used his work email account to send and receive sexually explicit and otherwise inappropriate messages, and to discuss illegal drugs.In a2016 interview with the Guardian, Flowers admitted taking drugs and having sex with male prostitutes when chair of the Co-op Bank. But, he said, he tried to be “a decent Christian person”.Explore more on these topicsManchesterUK criminal justiceChristianityCo-operative GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

It deepens inequality, weakens trust, and risks undoing decades of progress.“It is no coincidence that the drive to reverse inclusion efforts is often led by those who already hold advantage – those who benefit from an unlevel playing field. The reality is that at some point, every one of us will find ourselves in a minority – whether due to mental health, age, disability, or other circumstances.”Amid concerns for DEI in the UK, the equalities minister, Seema Malhotra, said the government had an “absolute commitment” to tackling racial inequality and diversity and inclusion.Meanwhile, leading industry figures defended the benefits of DEI and outlined their fears.Khoury-Haq said she was “saddened” at some businesses scaling back diversity policies, adding: “The speed at which some are doing it makes you wonder if they ever truly meant it.”Malhotra said a consultation would be launched later this year on theEquality (Race and Disability) bill, which would compel large employers to report on ethnicity and disability pay gaps.“Your race should never be a barrier to your progress,” Malhotra said. “This is not just about fair access to opportunity, but ensuring how we grow our economy.”The consultants McKinsey previously found that companies in the top quarter for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability compared with those in the fourth quartile, and its research showed the “strong business case for both gender diversity and ethnic and cultural diversity in corporate leadership”.Helena Morrissey, a former City fund manager and a long-time campaigner for boardroom representation for women, said: “I can’t believe that anyone in their right mind would say they want less diverse talent.”Morrissey, who chairs theDiversity Project, a cross-company investment and savings industry initiative, said they had received calls from employees concerned by unfolding developments, and she was worried companies might think “it’s all over, there’s no point in us trying any more”.Paul Sesay, an industry expert and the founder of theNational Diversity Awards, said rather than drop DEI, some UK businesses might merge it withenvironmental, social and governance(ESG) principles, which emphasise ethical behaviour, to avoid backlash.He said there was an understanding in UK business that there was further to go, and while “middle management” across sectors had seen “significantly more progress” since 2020, change was a “lot slower” when it came to chief officers and that when black professionals “do reach the top, they have to prove themselves so much more”.Nearly all the UK’s 100 largest listed companies now have at leastone minority ethnic director on their boards, according to the most recent progress update from the government-backed Parker review, which revealed a number still don’t.In addition, women occupied more than two in five seats on the boards of the UK’s largest listed companies in 2023, according to the government-backed annualFTSE women leaders review, which also found there were “too few” top female executives.Pavita Cooper, the UK chair of the30% Clubwhich campaigns globally for gender equality in corporate leadership, said: “If I thought we had a completely meritocratic system then I would be less worried.“It’s about making sure everyone gets that same chance, rather than a small group of elite people getting to the top of British institutions, whether that’s the arts or business.”Shabna Begum, the CEO of the race equality thinktank Runnymede Trust, criticised the previous Conservative government forframing diversity as “woke” red tape.She said: “There’s strong evidence DEI policies, implemented thoughtfully, actually improve productivity, performance and financial returns. This attack on DEI is a highly ideological act of self sabotage.”Co-op group initiatives include video interviews to prevent bias, replacing CV requirements for operational roles with assessments, an “opt-out” workplace savings scheme, and development programmes for female and black, Asian and minority ethnic representation in leadership.Co-op’s head of social mobility, inclusion and belonging, Zahoor Ahmad, said Trump had encouraged the false idea diversity is “discriminatory, not based on merit”.He said: “There’s aplane crash and [Trump] says DEI is to blame. The message is that we didn’t have qualified people doing that job, that the default setting, the white male, is the qualified person – and that’s fundamentally untrue.”Khoury-Haq said: “We should not be fooled into weakening our own prospects by dismantling the progress that has been made” when “the cost of living crisis has hit millions hard, and socioeconomic disadvantage is rife”, adding: “Now, more than ever, businesses have a responsibility to stand together to ensure every child and adult has the opportunity to reach their full potential.”Explore more on these topicsBusinessRaceGenderDisabilityCo-operative GroupnewsShareReuse this content"

He waselected a fellowof the UK’s national academy of sciences in 2018 as a result of his work and impact in the space and electric vehicle industries.However, theRoyal Societyis under mounting pressure to revoke the honour.In August, theGuardian revealeda number of fellows had written to the Royal Society expressing concern over Musk’s comments regarding unrest in the UK and calling for him to be stripped of his fellowship.Judge blocks Trump from cutting billions in medical research fundingRead moreProf Dorothy Bishop, a leading expert on children’s communication disorders at the University of Oxford, subsequentlyresigned her fellowshipbecause of a lack of action by the Royal Society, withAndrew Millar, a professor of systems biology at the University of Edinburgh, following suit this week, as first reported by Research Professional News.More than 1,700 members of the international scientific communityhave signed an open letterto the president of the Royal Society, Sir Adrian Smith, with signatories including Bishop, Sir Richard Peto – an eminent statistician and Royal Society fellow – and Prof Susan Michie of UCL, a behavioural scientist who became a household name during the Covid pandemic.Stephen Curry, an emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, said he was motivated to write the letter out of frustration at the organisation’s continued silence.“This isn’t an HR complaint about harassment or bullying or anything like that. This is a matter of behaviour that is entirely public,” he said. “Everybody can see what Musk has said and what he’s doing as head of Doge, and the Royal Society, which claims to have a strong voice for science within the UK, but actually, even on the international stage, has said absolutely nothing.”The letter notes the Royal Society was made aware of fellows’ concerns more than six months ago, and that since then Musk has made further incendiary comments.These includecalling the MP Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, a “rape genocide apologist”. Phillips has said the comments made her more worried about her safety.“I am at a loss to understand how these actions are consistent with a code of conduct that requires fellows to have ‘due regard for the statement of values developed from time to time by [the Royal] Society’,” Curry writes.The letter states the situation is rendered more serious because of Musk’s new position within a Trump administration that, Curry writes, “has over the past several weeks engaged in an assault on scientific research in the US that has fallen foul of federal courts”, noting that concerns have also been raised over censorship, particularly in the realm of climate science.The letter adds that the lack of comment by the Royal Society about Musk’s fellowship, other than its reiteration that concerns around individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence, “increasingly looks like a failure of moral courage”.Curry said he hopes the letter, as well as the recent resignations, would highlight to the Royal Society the breadth and depth of feeling within the scientific community about Musk’s fellowship.“If they believe at all in the values that they espouse in their code of conduct, then they really have to come out and explain to people why is it that they think that Musk’s behaviour is consistent with [them],” he said.The Guardian understands there is to be a meeting of the Fellowship of the Royal Society on 3 March to discuss the principles around public pronouncements and behaviour of fellows.A spokesperson for the Royal Society said: “In the event of any concerns raised about the behaviour of a fellow, the Society has a clear set of processes described in ourcode of conduct, which is published on our website along with relevant disciplinary regulations. Any issues raised in respect of individual fellows are dealt with in strict confidence.’’Explore more on these topicsRoyal SocietyElon MuskScience policyJess PhillipsAcademicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was also ordered to pay costs of £175,000.The deceased, Gareth Delbridge, 64, and Michael “Spike” Lewis, 58, died after being hit by the Swansea to London train near Margam, Port Talbot,on 3 July 2019. Another track worker with them narrowly avoided being struck.The workers were wearing ear defenders and appeared to not hear the warning horn or emergency braking of the approaching train.Accident investigators found that the plan set out by the controller of site safety was not followed, and the informal practices became “progressively less safe”.The Orr said its investigation of the incident found systematic and wide-ranging safety failures by Network Rail to protect workers from trains, with echoes of findings from previous incidents. It took formal enforcement action torequire Network Rail to improve worker safety, and said there had since been a “step change” in safety.Richard Hines, the HM chief inspector of railways, said the £3.75m fine “reflects the nature and gravity of Network Rail’s failings”.He said: “The rail industry needs to do all it practically can to help each worker get home safely every day … This will require a relentless, collective, industry focus to continue to drive down risk to ensure that tragic incidents such as this are never repeated.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Thursday, the inquest heard that antibiotics were not given until 1.25am because of amisunderstanding between a doctor and nurses.On Friday, Burns told the inquest: “In terms of antibiotics, I believe that these were only given when they were because I was there. I raised a concern about the lack of antibiotics eight times before they were administered.”In her statement, she said she grew increasingly desperate by her son’s bedside.She said: “William had one cannula in his left antecubital fossa [a dip in the front of the elbow] with no three-way tap, which meant he could only have one medication at a time. He was given fluid, two doses of morphine and paracetamol before he was given antibiotics. By 1.15am I had become desperate and tried to squeeze some of the paracetamol through in order to free up the cannula for the antibiotics.”Burns explained she had to help one of the resident doctors treating her son. She said: “The medical registrar told me that he was unfamiliar with the intravenous morphine, compelling me to advise him, which I did, as I wanted the antibiotics given.”She also highlighted delays in transferring her son from the hospital’s resuscitation (resus) area into intensive care.Burns said: “I witnessed that the emergency department and medical registrars were clearly not happy that the intensive care registrar would not accept referral of William. I believe that he was left unmonitored and untreated in resus for far too long.”Burns said mistakes continued in intensive care. She said: “His care was no better on the intensive care unit until it was too late. When the decision was made to intubate I was in deep despair. I had a suspicion that we would lose him completely, as his blood pressure would fall on intubation.“I decided to call William’s father – we are divorced – as I suspected that he would never see William again if he did not come to the hospital as soon as possible.”Dr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant and founder of the UKSepsistrust, said Hewes could have been saved if he had been given antibiotics within minutes and intensive care treatment had been brought forward by two hours.He told the court: “If we took 100 22-year-old adults in William’s condition, more than 50%, in fact, more like 70% to 75%, would survive.|Daniels added: “Based on the evidence I put forward, together with 23 years of clinical experience, I strongly believe that had William received timely care, according to national and international guidelines, he would have had at least a 50% chance of surviving this illness.”Dr Mathuratha Sivasubramaniam, the duty intensive care registrar, said she initially refused to admit Hewes to the unit, because he was showing signs of improvement.Neil Sheldon KC, the barrister for the Hewes family, questioned the reliability of Sivasubramaniam’s statement. The coroner, Mary Hassell, explained that Sivasubramaniam could not be questioned because she had since left the UK.Petr Dlouhy, an intensive care consultant, was informed about Hewes’s deteriorating condition shortly after 3am. He told the court he would have advised transferring Hewes to intensive care earlier if he had been informed sooner about his worsening condition.He said: “If I had heard that he looks very unwell and has a high heart rate and low blood pressure, and an already impaired kidney function, obviously I would admit him.”Asked if earlier admission could have saved Hewes, he said: “I don’t know if it would have made a difference.”The inquest continues.Explore more on these topicsSepsisHospitalsLondonHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

They were allabducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz, near Gaza, in the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023. Two were held by Hamas and one by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.The identities of the Palestinians due to be freed have not been published, but they are expected to include 333 people taken prisoner inGazasince the start of the war and 36 inmates serving life prison sentences.Israel and global human rights groups expressed outrage at thefrail, emaciated state of the three hostages freed a week ago, their accounts of brutality in captivity, and the handover event staged by Hamas in which the three men had to thank their captors in front of a line of masked, armed gunmen.1:04Hamas releases three more Israeli hostages as part of ceasefire deal – videoAn Israeli-American hostage released two weeks ago, Keith Siegel, has given a chilling account of his experiences. “I was held for 484 days in unimaginable conditions, every single day felt like it could be my last,” he said in a video message. “I was starved and I was tortured, both physically and emotionally.”The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has facilitated the exchanges, said in a statement: “The latest release operations reinforce the urgent need for ICRC access to those held hostage. We remain very concerned about the conditions of the hostages.” It called onHamasto ensure future handovers were conducted in privacy and with dignity.‘Who is Trump to decide our fate?’: takeover threat adds to uncertainty in GazaRead moreIf Saturday’s hostage release goes ahead, it will bring to 19 the number of Israelis exchanged for about 1,100 Palestinians.Five Thai citizens have also been released. By the end of the first six-week phase, another 14 hostages (six live and the remains of eight who have died in captivity) are due to be freed in exchange for another 800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.A second phase is due to begin on 1 March, in which both sides plan to release all remaining hostages and prisoners, and Israel would complete its military withdrawal from Gaza. But so far,Benjamin Netanyahuhas not empowered his negotiators to start talks on how this second phase would proceed, and Israeli analysts question the prime minister’s readiness to stick to the agreement.“It’s no secret that Netanyahu doesn’t want the deal to continue and wants to stop it before the second phase,” Haaretz’s military analyst,Amos Harel, wrote, adding that if the truce ended, there could be “a year or even longer” of fighting to come.The truce agreement appeared in danger of collapse this week after Hamas announced there would be an indefinite delay to the release of the next three hostages owing to Israel’s alleged violations of the deal. Soon after, Trump suggested that Israel should demand that the remaining hostages be freed by noon on Saturday or “all hell is going to break out”.0:48Trump warns 'all hell is going to break out' if Gaza hostage deadline not met by Hamas – videoIsrael massed troops around the edge of the Gaza Strip, deepening fears the ceasefire would come to an abrupt end. On Thursday, however, theimmediate crisis appeared to recedewith Hamas confirming three Israelis would be freed and Netanyahu’s office clarifying that it was not demanding the liberation of all the remaining hostages.However, Trump’s shocking proposal the US would claim possession of Gaza, which would be emptied of its 2.2 million Palestinian inhabitants and developed into a “Riviera” resort coastline, hasclouded the prospectsfor the ceasefire’s survival over the coming weeks.Egypt and Jordan have made it clear to Trump’s administration that they are not prepared to host hundreds of thousands of Palestinians ethnically cleansed from Gaza.The two Arab states, joined by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are expected to take part in the Saudi-hosted summit on 20 February, according to sources quoted by Agence France-Presse. The meeting is reportedly intended to hammer out a development plan for Gaza to present as an alternative option to Trump’s proposal.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesHamasBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

The pontiff has started “hospital drug therapy”, the statement added, and his “clinical condition is fair; he has a slight fever”.The pontiff’s planned attendance at an audience on Saturday has been cancelled, while mass in Saint Peter’s Basilica on Sunday will instead be delivered by Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça. A visit to the Cinecittà film studios on Monday has also been cancelled.Francis, 88, held several meetings on Friday before being taken to hospital, including with Mark Thompson, the CEO of the CNN news channel, which later reported that the pontiff was “mentally alert but struggling to speak for extended periods due to breathing difficulties”.Vatican installs webcam at St Peter’s tomb for next year’s Catholic jubileeRead moreThe pope, who has been blighted by ill-health in recent years, was also hospitalised in March 2023 with acute bronchitis. After being discharged, he said: “I am still alive.” He was readmitted to the Gemelli for health checks in June that year and again in February 2024 after suffering from what he said was “a bit of a cold”.Francis had part of his lung removed in his early 20s while training to be a priest in his native Argentina. In June 2021, he underwent a colon operation.He has often been seen in a wheelchair or with a walking stick due to a sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem. In January, he injured his right forearm after falling at his Casa Santa Marta residence and on 1 February he stumbled after his walking stick snapped while entering the Vatican’s auditorium. In early December, Francis hit his chin on his nightstand, reportedly after a fall.Francis, whose schedule has intensified because of this year’s catholic jubilee, has often alluded to resigning if bad health prevents him from doing his job. In 2023, he revealed he had chosen his burial place – the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in the Esquilino neighbourhood of Rome – breaking with the longstanding tradition of popes being buried in the grottos beneath St Peter’s Basilica.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanReligionItalyCatholicismChristianityThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

Gunfire rang out but the rebel forces encountered little resistance. Shops and businesses had long closed, and frightened civilians fled.Bukavu previously fell to soldiers who deserted the Congolese army in 2004 and the capture of the city would in effect give the M23 total control of the Lake Kivu area.Hours earlier, the rebels seized the airport in the town of Kavumu, where Congolese troops had been positioned.Last monththe rebels took Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, in a similar lightning offensive.On Thursday, the group captured Kabamba and the commercial centre of Katana as they advanced south along the N2 road. “M23 soldiers are blocking the road and are heading towards Kavumu – they already have control of Katana,” a local person told Reuters.Airport employees said it had been emptied and in effect closed, with Congolese forces having removed an aircraft and other equipment. Troops were seen heading back to Bukavu in military trucks and on motorbikes laden with mattresses and other belongings.Who are the M23 rebels and why is there fighting in eastern DRC?Read moreCorneille Nangaa, the head of the Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said militias had been attacked and were defending themselves.Congo’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, travelled to Germany to attendthe Munich Security Conferenceon Friday as he seeks international support to end the conflict in eastern DRC.He is not attending this weekend’s annual African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, which is focused on efforts to halt the conflict, with the prime minister, Judith Suminwa Tuluka, taking his place.MapFighting has raged in eastern DRC for the last three years, but the recent surge in violence has prompted international calls for de-escalation and worsened an already dire humanitarian situation. The fighting has destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters around Goma and Minova in South Kivu, leaving 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter,according to the UN.M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led insurgent groups that have operated in the mineral-rich eastern DRC since a 2003 deal was meant to end wars that had killed 6 million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The group is backed byRwanda, which says its primary interest is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide. The Congolese government and several UN reports say in fact Rwanda is using the group as a means to extract and then export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobile phones.The fighting has drawn in armies of many countries from within and outside the continent, including those that contribute to a UN peacekeeping mission. Canada announced this week it had withdrawn its military personnel from the force, citing“increasingly perilous security conditions”in Goma.On Thursday a popular Congolese singer was killed in the city while making a music video. The body of Delphin Katembo Vinywasiki, popularly known by his stage name Delcat Idengo, was found along a road near Kilijiwe district in northern Goma in the afternoon, with witnesses saying he died on the spot after being shot in the head.Social media images showed the body of Vinywasiki, dressed in military trousers for the video shoot, lying on the ground.Vinywasiki, whose songs often criticised conflict and human rights violations in DRC, was one of hundreds of prisoners who broke out of a prison in Goma during the M23 advance last month. He had been incarcerated for allegedly inciting people to arm themselves and force UN peacekeepers out of the country and was awaiting trial.The circumstances around the singer’s death are unclear. Patrick Muyaya, a DRC government spokesperson, condemned the killing, which he described as abominable. “Neither horror, nor terror, and even less the untimely resort to arms against innocent civilians will be able to extinguish the flame of resistance in Goma and throughout the country,”he wrote on X.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandanewsShareReuse this content"

The newspaper said the tests, completed on Thursday, attributed the blood stains to Cardia’s genetic profile. The result is expected to be handed to prosecutors on 28 February.Cardia’s lawyer, Solange Marchignoli, suggested that the presence of Cardia’s DNA did not rule out a supernatural phenomena.“The DNA stain warrants further investigation,” Marchignoli told Corriere. “We are waiting to find out whether it’s a mixed or single profile.” She argued that while it was obvious there would be traces of Cardia’s DNA because she had “kissed and handled the statue”, it could have been mixed up with others, possibly even that of the Virgin Mary. “Who can say? Do you know the Madonna’s DNA?”Cardia, who has a previous conviction for bankruptcy fraud, bought the statue in 2016 at a Catholic pilgrimage site in Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It later became the centrepiece of the pilgrimage site she created in Trevignano Romano, with people from acrossItalyflocking to the town for monthly worship, much to the irritation of local residents.Cardia reportedly left Trevignano, but it is unclear where she is now. Marchignoli said: “I don’t know where she’s currently praying, but I know for a fact that she is moved by a deep faith and has nothing to gain from this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Including warning labels would help raise awareness and encourage people to think about how much they drink”, said Malcolm Clarke,CancerResearch UK’s senior prevention policy manager.The World Cancer Research Fund, which monitors evidence on what lifestyle and other factors increase the risk of the disease, urged governments worldwide to act.Kate Oldridge-Turner, the organisation’s head of policy and public affairs, said: “Despite the fact that our own evidence shows alcohol is a risk factor for at least seven cancers, it is currently exempt from any mandatory warning labels in most countries. This is of great concern given how few people are aware of the links between alcohol and cancer.“Clear, highly visible health warning labels increase consumers’ awareness of the risks associated with drinking, and should be standard in Europe and around the world.”Dr Vivek Murthy, who was the surgeon general in Joe Biden’s administration, made thesame suggestionlast month.Ireland will become the first country in the EU to compel alcohol producers to put health warnings on labels including a reference to cancer from May next year.Labels warning about alcohol and pregnancy are already in place in France and Lithuania, while in Germany labels stipulate how old drinkers need to be before they can legally imbibe.Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s regional director for Europe, said: “Clear and prominent health warning labels on alcohol, which include a specific cancer warning, are a cornerstone of the right to health because they empower individuals with vital information to make informed choices about the harm alcoholic products can cause.“Providing this information does not take anything away from consumers. On the contrary, it arms them with knowledge and knowledge is power”.Dr Gauden Galea, a WHO strategic adviser on non-communicable diseases, said such warnings should be highly visible on cans and bottles and not just carried on websites. Governments must “resist all the pressures that will inevitably come from commercial actors” seeking to block the rollout of such labels, he said.The Portman Group, which represents alcohol producers in the UK, said warning labels would be too harsh a response to problematic drinking and would unsettle people.A spokesperson said: “Whilst we do not dispute the link between alcohol and cancer, and that drinking at harmful levels is dangerous and increases risks, blanket cancer warning labels are not a proportionate policy measure and do not put the risks into an appropriate context. This can create unnecessary anxiety, eroding trust in health advice and alienating the very people who require support.”Dr Katherine Severi, the chief executive of the Institute ofAlcoholStudies thinktank, backed the WHO’s call. “In the UK we’ve got into a ludicrous situation where a bottle of orange juice or milk require more information on their label than a bottle of wine or vodka. Our inadequate regulations have for too long favoured alcohol companies over the health of the public.”She said Wes Streeting, the health secretary, should introduce “mandatory labelling requirements. People have a right to know what they are putting in their bodies.”The department of health and social care has no plans to introduce health labels on alcohol products.A spokesperson said: “This government is committed to shifting from sickness to prevention, which includes reversing the trends we’ve seen in alcohol related deaths. That’s why we are investing an additional £267m in drug and alcohol treatment this year, to ensure more people receive better quality support. On top of this, we have already begun developing a national cancer plan to help us fight cancer on all fronts, including through prevention.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholCancerHealthWorld Health OrganizationnewsShareReuse this content"

In September Dutch police said he remained missing andoffered a €200,000 (£170,000) rewardfor any information leading to his arrest.In a dramatic development last month that sent ripples through international law enforcement circles, Leijdekkerswas seen attending a New Year’s Day church servicewith Sierra Leone’s presidential family, in footage posted on Facebook by the country’s first lady.Reuters, which verified the footage using facial recognition technology, quoted sources who said he had been benefitting from high-level protection in Sierra Leone, one of a number of west African transit points for cocaine trafficking from South America toEurope. Responding to the footage, Dutch prosecutors said Leijdekkers had been living in Sierra Leone for at least six months.But Leijdekkers’ presence can now be dated back to at least December 2022. Multiple sources told the Guardian that he was present at a New Year’s Eve party that year at the Mamba Point resort in the capital, Freetown. The testimony corroborated footage that has been circulating in Sierra Leone of a man who resembles Leijdekkers involved in a fracas at a nightclub. Analysis of the footage showed it had been filmed at Mamba Point. At one point the words “Happy New Year 2023” can be seen on a screen in the background.View image in fullscreenA composite of screengrabs from footage showing a man resembling Johannes Leijdekkers (in yellow) at a nightclub in Freetown on New Year’s Eve 2022.Photograph: social mediaSources also placed Leijdekkers at a house party hosted by a popular Lebanese couple in the Tokeh beach area in December 2023. Footage from the party shows a man resembling Leijdekkers in attendance.Sources said Leijdekkers has been in a relationship with Agnes Bio, a daughter of Sierra Leone’s president, Julius Maada Bio. Leijdekkers and Bio were sitting next to each other in the church service footage from 1 January this year. Bio is the president’s daughter from a previous relationship with Zainab Kandeh, Sierra Leone’s consul to Morocco. She serves as analternate representativeof Sierra Leone on the UN Security Council.The Dutchman was also present at Maada Bio’s farm in his hometown of Tihun during a visit in 2024, according to an official in the presidency who spoke anonymously. Footage of a man resembling Leijdekkers has been in circulation showing him being cheered by villagers as he bent to harvest rice.View image in fullscreenA man resembling Johannes Leijdekkers (in the white top and black cap) seen at a farm belonging to Sierra Leone’s president Julius Maada Bio in Tihun last year.Photograph: screengrabLeijdekkers, who has assumed numerous aliases and nicknames, including Bolle Jos, was sentenced in absentia by a Rotterdam court last June to 24 years in prison for six drug transports totalling 7,000kg of cocaine, an armed robbery in Finland, and ordering the murder of an associate. He was also given a 10-year sentence in absentia by a court in Belgium in September over an attempt to smuggle drugs via the port of Antwerp in 2020.Organised criminal groups have long used west African countries as a staging post for cocaine shipments from South America to Europe. The revelations about Leijdekkers come at an awkward moment for the authorities in Sierra Leone, which last month recalled its ambassador from neighbouring Guinea after seven suitcases containing suspected cocaine were found in an embassy vehicle.A composite image released by Dutch police showing Johannes Leijdekkers in 2011.Photograph: Netherlands PolitieAfter the first reports emerged of Leijdekkers’ presence in Sierra Leone, authorities in Freetown said the president had “no knowledge about the identity and the issues detailed in the reports about the individual in question”. The presidency official told the Guardian that the presidency had been unaware of Leijdekkers’ background untila Reuters report on 24 January. The official gave no further details.In a press conference last week in Freetown, inspector-general of police William Fayia Sellu, said an “open-source investigation” into the footage from 1 January had determined that the “the individual in the pictures being circulated online is called Omar Sheriff”.“Raids have been conducted at specific locations where this individual was said to be present and he has not been found yet,” Sellu said. He declined to say how the identity of the man had been determined or whether Omar Sheriff and Johannes Leijdekkers are the same person.The information minister, Chernor Bah, told the same press conference that investigators were “looking into” whether the man they had identified had been in the country for more than six months. “I don’t think they [police] have established a definite timeframe yet,” Bah later told the Guardian. “At this stage, they are comfortable to say that records for the past six months don’t reveal that person via any formal entry points in our country.”It remains unclear if Leijdekkers is still in Sierra Leone. Last week, the Dutch justice minister said an extradition request had been sent to authorities in the country. A representative for the Dutch justice ministry did not respond to a request for comments.Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeSierra LeoneAfricaNetherlandsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The network, citing internal government documents, said the flight would include citizens from Cameroon.The Darién Gap, dividing Panama from Colombia, has become a busy transit route for immigrants making their way through Central America en route to the US. In 2023, more than half a million immigrants, mostly from Venezuela, crossed the Darién jungle into Panama.

But the damaging weather timed so closely after the deadlywildfiresthat left communities acrossLos Angelesin ruins last month has increased the impacts.It’s a foreboding sign of the risks posed when fire dangers lurk throughout the year. Theclimate crisishas increased the likelihood of compounding extremes and the risks will continue to rise as the world warms.While the heavy rains from the storm hitting the region began to ease on Thursday night, the risk of rock and mudslides on wildfire-scarred hillsides continued on Friday since dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away.One member of theLos Angelesfire department was in the vehicle when it went into the water in Malibu and was able to exit with minor injuries, a department spokesperson, Erik Scott, said on the social platform X.In Pacific Palisades on Thursday, one intersection of the highway was submerged in at least 3ft (about 1 metre) of sludge, with some drivers trying to force their way through and police officers pushing one vehicle through the muck. Bulldozers worked to clear the roads not far from where just weeks ago they moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month’s wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot.View image in fullscreenMud covers the Pacific Coast Highway on Thursday.Photograph: Ethan Swope/APIn north Altadena, a road near the Eaton fire burn scar was also covered in several feet of mud, vegetation and trees as a flood of water overcame concrete blocks put in place to prevent such debris flows. The area was mostly deserted.In neighboring Sierra Madre, the city issued evacuation orders for areas affected by the Eaton fire, warning in a social media post that fire, police and public works personnel would not enter areas experiencing active mud and debris flows and anyone who remained in a home under evacuation orders would need to shelter in place until areas are deemed safe for city personnel to enter.Azusa police said the roof of a grocery store partially collapsed while shoppers were inside the store on Thursday evening, but everyone got out safely, KABC-TV reported.The weather service was expected to survey damage on Friday at a mobile home park in Oxnard that was hit by 60mph (96km/h) wind gusts on Thursday afternoon, the Los Angeles Times reported. They would determine whether there was a weak tornado at the park, the meteorologist Carol Smith said.To the north, snow and ice contributed to major pileups on highways inOregonand Washington, injuring at least 10 people, as a winter storm descended on the Pacific north-west.View image in fullscreenDuke’s restaurant after mudslides caused by heavy rain in Malibu on Thursday.Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/Rex/ShutterstockThe west coast storms are just the latest in a week of bad weather across the US that cut power to tens of thousands.Meanwhile, meteorologists warn that the United States is about to get its 10th and coldest polar vortex stretching event this season. Weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the north pole into the United States and Europe. The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains on Saturday and then stick around all next week.As the downpour intensified on Thursday, the National Weather Service issued flash flood and severe thunderstorm warnings for a swath of eastern Los Angeles county. The rain caused a rockslide and pushed mud on to the road in Malibu Canyon, and a large debris flow left about 8in (20cm) of mud across a road in the Hollywood Hills.SouthernCaliforniareported 1 to 2in of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 3 to 6in across the coastal slopes on Thursday, according to the weather service.More than 30,000 people in California were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us.Evacuation orders and warnings were issued in areas where hillsides were scarred by thePalisades fire, the most destructive in LA history. In addition to burning the vegetation that keeps soil in place, the fires also added loose debris to the landscape, including ash, soil and rocks.View image in fullscreenAn illuminated freeway sign warns motorist of severe weather on Thursday.Photograph: David McNew/Getty ImagesBefore the storm, officials distributed sandbags, positioned rescue swimmers and told residents to have go-bags ready. Sandbags and temporary concrete barriers were in place across Altadena, where the Eaton fire destroyed thousands of homes.Despite recent storms, much of southern California remains in extreme or severe drought, according to the US Drought Monitor. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that while the area was desperate for rain, this storm might bring too much too quickly.In Altadena, Mehran Daoudian prepared by laying tarp over a hole in his home’s roof where fire burned through it last month. Daoudian said he was grateful that city workers arranged sandbags and concrete barriers in his neighborhood over the past few weeks.“I did not leave the cars on the street because with the mudslide, [they] might go down,” he said.Near the burn scar for the Airport fire in Orange county, Trabuco Canyon Road was overtaken by mud and debris, Orange county public works posted on social media.View image in fullscreenA fire department vehicle in the water after being swept away in a mudslide after heavy rain in Malibu on Thursday.Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/Rex/ShutterstockIn the San Francisco Bay area, there were blackouts, small landslides and inundated roadways. Authorities urged people to evacuate Felton Grove, a small community along the central coast, as the San Lorenzo River threatened to top its banks.In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation.And in northernUtah, rain and snow created dangerous conditions on mountain roads leading to ski resorts. The state department of transportation issued a road safety alert warning of a mix of heavy snow and rain through Friday.First responders searched every vehicle in a pileup Thursday near, about 25 miles (40km) east of Portland, Oregon, the Multnomah county sheriff’s office said. The office initially said more than 100 cars were involved, but the state transportation department later said the number was 20 to 30 vehicles. Oregon state police said four people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries.The pileup happened during near-whiteout conditions in the westbound lanes of Interstate 84, authorities said. An SUV caught fire, but its occupants escaped.Multnomah county officials extended a state of emergency through at least Friday and said eight shelters would be open. Officials said 489 people went to the shelters on Wednesday night.Wind chills could dip to 10F (-12C) in Portland, the weather service said.In southern Washington, six people were taken to hospitals with injuries in another pileup of 22 vehicles on Interstate 5 near the Cowlitz River, a state patrol spokesperson, Will Finn, said. There were 95 crashes on Thursday in five counties in the state’s south-west.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaLos AngelesUS weatherWest CoastCalifornia wildfiresUS wildfiresWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

Its creators recall the parties, the music, the fashion, and being ‘right on one, matey’Daniel Dylan WrayFri 14 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareWhen Andrew Weatherall suddenlydied in February2020, the outpouring of grief was monumental. The DJ and producer was a revered figure, known for producing and remixing indie-dance crossover acts such asPrimal Scream, as well as being a curatorial guru on everything from thumping techno to deep dub via obscure rockabilly. His status as an influential and beloved music figure even garnered him the nickname the Guv’nor. But prior to this he went under another name: the Outsider.This was his nom de plume as a writer for the fanzine Boy’s Own, which launched back in 1986. In the first issue Weatherall set out its intentions: “We are aiming at the boy (or girl) who one day stands on the terraces, the next stands in a sweaty club, and the day after stays in bed and reads Brendan Behan while listening to Run-DMC.”Founded by Weatherall, Terry Farley, Steve Mayes, Steve Hall, and Cymon Eckel, the intention was to document their own world, a predominantly working-class one, in a way that they didn’t see being covered by the music weeklies or glossy monthlies. It was a boisterous and scrappy mixture of football, fashion, music, clubbing, politics and biting humour. Almost 40 years on from that first issue, and five since the sad passing of Weatherall, the collective have reprinted a hardback collection of all the fanzines, as well as launching a new line of Boy’s Own clothing.View image in fullscreenIn the mix … Andrew Weatherall performing on stage in London, 1994.Photograph: Mick Hutson/RedfernsInitially, Boy’s Own was sold in pubs, clubs, warehouse parties and football terraces but “nobody bought it”, recalls Farley. “It was very niche – just us talking about our mates.” The gang had all bonded growing up on the outskirts of London, in Slough and Windsor, as a hodgepodge suburban crew of soul boys, football casuals, clothes obsessives and ardent clubbers. Every Friday they took acid at 9pm and hit London – a tradition known as “the nine o’clock drop”; years later this would also be the name of a compilation album Weatherall released.It would take a widespread youth culture phenomenon for things to really blow up for Boy’s Own. “A few people identified with it but it didn’t kick in until acid house happened,” recalls Eckel. “Then it went fucking wild.” By their spring 1988 issue – featuring a front cover of a bunch of young kids, one in a Boy’s Own T-shirt, in front of a brick wall with graffiti reading “drop acid not bombs” – they were publishing articles such asBermondsey Goes Balearicby Paul Oakenfold, exploring the burgeoning scene in London around clubs like Shoom and Future, as well as chronicling his adventures in Ibiza.Two to three thousand copies of each issue were printed and the publication quickly became something of a scene bible, complete with its own in-jokes, digs and unique lexicon, so much so that by 1989 Weatherall even wrote a handy guide to the definitions of commonly used slang, such as “Log: If you don’t know what one is, you are one.” Its tagline – “The only fanzine that gets right on one, matey” – soon became a staple saying for those in the know around drug culture. The message even spread overseas, with German outfit the Beat Pirate releasing the acid house track Are You on 1 Matey? “It was just a bit of humour and fun,” says Hall. “But it became the language that kids were using to explain this new experience.”View image in fullscreenKarma collective … Marina Banks, Andy Leach and Jonna Richardson at a Boy’s Own rave.Photograph: David SwindellsIn 1988, with the second summer of love around the corner for a new generation, Boy’s Own was about to graduate from making DIY magazines to throwing legendary parties. That spring Eckel was working as a carpenter on a video shoot for George Michael when he had an industrial accident and lost a finger. While he was in a specialist reconstructive surgery ward he became friends with another young person there who had trapped his fingers in a credit card machine. They bonded “over music and drugs” and would sneak a spliff every Friday at the back door of the hospital. Through this connection, Eckel learned of a guy who owned a studio in a barn that he also threw parties in.Soon enough the Boy’s Own crew, operating as the Karma Collective “because we didn’t do branding then”, were throwing their own. They landed in the Berkshire countryside and laid out hay bales, blew up a bouncy castle and set up a pumping sound system. The end result they describe as “part-rave, part-punk gig and part-garden party”, which brought together “football lads, punks, fashionistas and the wide-eyed ravers who were discovering ecstasy for the first time”.It was a combination that few had experienced before. “It was definitely the first time I’d been to an acid house party that was outdoors,” recalls Hall. Boy George could be heard singing a cappella in the early hours as the sun rose and when the police arrived at about 8am – to find a group of smiling, dancing young people in smiley face-covered bright clothes and bandanas listening to squelchy electronic sounds – they didn’t have a clue. “They just told us to keep it down and be careful when driving home,” recalls Farley. “It all looked quite innocuous to their eyes – no alcohol and just people lounging about in a beatific sort of way.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Such was their growing reputation for spinning killer records and having their finger on the pulse that Weatherall and Farley started to be hired as producers and remixers for the likes of Happy Mondays, New Order, the Farm and Primal Scream. Between 1990 and 1993 London Records gave them their own label to play with, on which they released music by Bocca Juniors, Jah Wobble, DSK and Denim, but the success didn’t match up to the work the crew had done for other labels and they became fed up with one another. They wrapped up the fanzine in 1992, the same year that Hall and Farley started their own independent label, Junior Boy’s Own, which signed the Chemical Brothers and Underworld before the label was split into two in the late 1990s, before things wound down in the mid-2000s.View image in fullscreenParty hard … Ravers and hay bales at dawn.Photograph: David SwindellsIn hindsight, Boy’s Own was something of an all-encompassing lifestyle brand before such a thing was commonplace: a magazine spanning music, politics, fashion and their own subculture, that released records, signed artists and threw parties. But all they wanted to do at the time was be creative and have fun. “I’m proud that we did it for the sake of doing it, as opposed to for commercial ends,” says Eckel. “It was wonderfully innocent. We could have been Cream or Ministry of Sound, but we just did things we believed in.”It still takes Farley by surprise how a bunch of working-class lads, made up of gas fitters and carpenters, created something that connected on such a profound cultural level. “This guy recently pulled his sleeve down and he had a Boy’s Own tattoo,” he recalls. “And he’s like: ‘I love you guys’. I didn’t know what to say. I smiled, it made me laugh, but it also made me kind of go: 'Fuck! This was important to people. A lot of people. And if we in any way influenced other people to do better things in their lives then it was more than worth it.”When Weatherall wrote the introduction to the final ever issue of Boy’s Own, he was able to write his own obituary. “It’s with sadness (and a slight smirk) that I must announce the death of The Outsider,” he began, before painting a scenario of a body discovered around a pile of King Tubby records and Boy’s Own back issues. Sadly, Weatherall didn’t get to plan out his own ending in such detail, but being surrounded by music, words and his own creative output feels like a fitting, and symbolic, closing chapter. “We miss him,” says Hall. “But I think he’d be proud to this day of what Boy’s Own achieved.”Boy’s Own clothing and fanzines are available fromboysownproductions.comExplore more on these topicsMusicAndrew WeatherallDance musicClubbingClub culturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Having escaped a violent and heavy-drinking father,Mary Wollstonecraftploughed a singular path. Avowedly independent and radical in thought, she dazzled and discombobulated a crusty male establishment with her intellect. She turned from governess to author and landed a reporting job in revolutionary France. Among her works, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman is a foundational feminist text. After that, giving birth to Mary Shelley seems like a postscript.Maureen Lennon’s patchwork tribute forHull Truckand Pilot theatre is a musical collage of fast-paced scenes designed to memorialise a pioneer of sexual equality. As Lennon has it, this is a woman who demands parity with men, radicalises children and refuses to be shouted down. The play is “told for all women who find themselves howling at the world”.So far, so uncontentious. Where the production falters is in a mismatch of form and content. Directed by Esther Richardson, it follows mid 20th-century practitioners such as Bertolt Brecht, Joan Littlewood and John McGrath in its combination of snappy demonstrative scenes and illustrative songs. Designer Sara Perks puts the six actors in boots, bodices and flouncy skirts to create a new-romantic look that is reflected in Ayesha Fazal’s pop-video choreography and the synth-heavy score byBilly Nomates. In the lead role, Laura Elsworthy has a mop of blood-orange hair that shrieks rebelliousness.All this resists the pull towards romanticised period drama in favour of a cartoon-like immediacy. But it is a jokey format without jokey content. In the first half we get one overwrought scene after another, too short for us to identify with the characters, too angsty to show Wollstonecraft as a rounded human being. There is much shouting and no emotional range.Similarly humourless are the songs, all strident calls-to-arms performed with much earnestness – arms aloft, clenched fists and punches in the air – but with as little joy as there is tonal variety. They feel shoehorned in.Things perk up with the chewier scenes of the second half, when Wollstonecraft wrestles with putting theory into practice and the dramatic momentum builds. But for all the ensemble’s commitment, Mary and the Hyenas strains too hard to make its revolutionary point.AtHull Truck theatreuntil 1 March, then atWilton’s Music Hall, London, 18-29 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreHull Truck theatreMary WollstonecraftreviewsShareReuse this content"

Still outpacing her are the Rolling Stones with 14, then Robbie Williams and the Beatles, joint top with 15.Featuring performances from the studio album of the same name, Lover (Live from Paris) is Swift’s fourth live album, and the first to reach No 1. It was originally released in limited quantities for Valentine’s Day in 2023, and reached No 90, but 47,000 sales of a new heart-shaped double vinyl version – the latest of the ever more elaborate and numerous physical editions of Swift albums – took it to the top. It’s the biggest opening week for an album this year.Lover (Live from Paris) has never been released on streaming services as a whole album (though its tracks are individually available), and it’s rare to get a No 1 album without streams. In fact, the last person to do it was Taylor Swift. Eight years ago she releasedReputation, and got to No 1 solely from sales of the album, before putting it on streaming a few weeks later.It took Swift until her fourth album, 2012’s Red, to score her first UK No 1, and her tally has since been helped by her project to rerecord her albums, with new versions of Fearless, Red, Speak Now and 1989 all topping the chart. Fans are now anticipating the last in this series, Reputation. Swift, however, may be enjoying some time off after herEras tour, which became – by some distance – the highest-grossing concert tour of all time when it concluded in December.In at No 2 in this week’s chart are rock band Inhaler, fronted by Bono’s son Elijah Hewson, with their third album Open Wide. Kendrick Lamar jumps back into the Top 3 from No 31, buoyed up by the physical release ofhis album GNXand his much-discussedSuper Bowl half-time show.The Super Bowl also propelled Lamar’s Drake diss track Not Like Us up the singles chart to No 2, the highest placing for any Lamar track, though Lola Young’s Messy remains at the top for a fourth week.The five Grammy awards won by Not Like Us will have helped its chart performance, and other Grammy winners have experienced a boost. Best new artist winner Chappell Roan’s Pink Pony Club reaches a new high of No 4, while Benson Boone’s former No 1 Beautiful Things vaults up to No 6 off the back of his acrobatic viral performance of the song at the awards. Doechii’s Denial Is a River was another much-shared performance, and the track becomes her first Top 10 hit, at No 9.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockTaylor SwiftUK chartsKendrick LamarnewsShareReuse this content"

In 1974, he took part in a kind of documentary nonfiction project undertaken by author Linda Rosenkrantz, in which he simply came to her apartment and recounted into a tape machine everything that happened to him on a certain day.Condoms, cows and contortions: Peter Hujar’s astonishing vision – in picturesRead moreThe tape is lost, but the typescript survived, published three years ago as Peter Hujar’s Day and now filmed by director Ira Sachs as a verbatim-cinema chamber piece entirely within Rosenkrantz’s apartment, sometimes in different rooms or pensively up on the roof looking out at the skyline, shot to make it look like it was filmed on 16mm at the time, with ungainly cuts, and scratches on the print.Rebecca Hall plays Rosenkrantz, asking questions and listening with a continuous air of alert, slightly quizzical and sympathetic amusement. Ben Whishaw is Hujar himself, telling her about a day which he considered quite boring, but was (he now realises) crowded with incident: worrying about money, worrying about health, worrying about lack of sleep, going to Allen Ginsberg to photograph him for the New York Times – a rather surreal encounter – coming back, having a Chinese meal with someone and finishing the day by playing Bach on the harpsichord.Whishaw is conscientiously lowkey and focused, maintaining a realist, matter-of-fact consistency of pace and tone, and only occasionally and subtly suggesting his own emotional reaction to what he is saying. It’s very different from how it might be written as a fictional dramatic monologue – there are no phases of tears, or laughter, or sudden quiet-voiced moments of self-knowledge. Sachs leaves it up to us to edit the stream of consciousness and to isolate the Leopold Bloom moments of importance.When Hujar went to Ginsberg, the poet disconcerted the photographer by chanting in the middle of the shoot and suggesting that Hujar perform oral sex on his next scheduled subject: William Burroughs. If all this was insufferable, Hujar doesn’t say so. It is another reminder of how hugely famous and therefore indulged Ginsberg was. Hujar drops a fair few names in the course of this piece, and one of the least important (he implies) ishis journalist friend Fran Lebowitz, who he thinks could maybe write an introduction to his next published collection of photos, though naturally he would prefer Susan Sontag. “I’ve always had a star thing …” he sheepishly confesses. What would Hujar and Rosenkrantz say if you could time-travel back to 1974 and explain that in 50 years’ time Lebowitz would be more famous than any of them?‘He was a born member of the underground’: how Peter Hujar captured the New York demimondeRead moreHis chronic tiredness is attributed by Rosenkrantz to poor diet. How many vegetables does he eat? Not many, Hujar concedes with a shrug. He smokes so many cigarettes he has a permanent nicotine hangover. He has no one in his life to look after him. Perhaps he is lonely, but not necessarily.He’s also getting longsighted. Rosenkrantz agrees – she has bursitis and they both thought that these old-people things could never happen to them. On the subject of having to stand back to look at something, Hujar regales Rosenkrantz with the story of photographer Maurice Hogenboom, who was on a shoot in Brazil, stood back to look at something, fell off a cliff and died. Perhaps the most important moment comes with an epiphany of sorts, as Hujar reveals that he has only recently grasped – perhaps at this very moment – that you need time to be a photographer, or any sort of artist: time to think, time to work, time to stand and stare. Maybe this real-time transcription of his day has disclosed this to him.And what is the point of this film? Perhaps it is inevitably going to be of limited interest, and as intelligent as the two performances are, neither Whishaw nor Hall is tested very much. But it is an intriguing experiment in recovering the moment-by-moment reality of a lost time and place.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalPeter HujarBen WhishawRebecca HallreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the roar of a wrestler’s body-slam or a diva’s ovation – throaty, triumphant, immoderate. Thomas’s exhibition is all that, and glamorous too, opening with a room of monumental portraits of black women. All are painted on panels with rounded corners – no frame is enclosingthesewomen.Working from staged photographs and found images, Thomas’s compositions are hymns to excess. Figures emerge in fragments from layers of pattern, like the swirling kimonos that unfurl to reveal body parts in Japanese woodcuts. The bodies themselves are radically flattened, rendered in simplified graphic forms like Tom Wesselmann’s Great American Nudes of the 1960s. Yet unlike those nudes, Thomas’s figures have names, and eyes, and agency. Posed naked on a couch covered in florals and animal prints, the woman in A Little Taste Outside of Love (2007) is identified as the artist’s ex-girlfriend Maya.In navigating the territory between joy and sorrow, Thomas has two great weapons at her disposal: rhinestones and Eartha Kitt. A liberal crusting of the former gives these flat paintings depth and movement. In Mama Bush: (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher, violet and indigo highlights sparkle from the artist’s mother’s rhinestone afro. Her smile radiates with such a shimmer you can barely focus. A recent painting of a medical student called Din dances before your eyes in iridescent starbursts.View image in fullscreenMickalene Thomas, Mama Bush: (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher (2009).Photograph: © Mickalene ThomasThomas reflects on the way black women have been pictured – or not. Tucked in the margins of historical paintings, naked and available as “exotic” objects of desire, occupying their accepted roles as performers. Rhinestones were created to dazzle under electric light and create spectacle on stage. They dress bodies that move for pleasure and entertainment. In applying them to a fixed surface, Thomas makes the viewer do the work. The women in her paintings are going nowhere. We have to move to make them sparkle.Two devastating works are soundtracked by Eartha Kitt. In Me as Muse (2016), a bank of TV screens flickers between patterns and body parts, slowly revealing the reclining nude form of Thomas herself. The audio is a BBC interview in which Kitt describes being cast out of her family, her early years of service and abuse, and the love that evaded her: “There were plenty of men who wanted to lay me down, but none who wanted to raise me up.”In an adjacent gallery, four screens show Kitt singing Angelitos Negros alongside Thomas and two other women, styled and filmed as though all were performing in the 1960s. Their voices implore an artist to paint black angels into a church interior and break the customary depiction of heaven as a literal zone of white supremacy. Kitt weeps as she sings. Thomas, the painter, accepts her challenge, filling the gallery with exalted figures.View image in fullscreenMickalene Thomas, Sleep Deux Femmes Noires (2012).Photograph: © Mickalene ThomasThis exhibition borrows its title from American scholar bell hooks’ all about love (1999), which argues for the importance of love, whether sacred, familial, social or romantic. Taking over the Hayward with domestic furnishings, disco music, shrines filled with favourite books and even shag carpeting, Thomas makes space for intimacy of all kinds. For hooks, the invitation to cherish love had a political imperative: “I feel our nation’s turning away from love as intensely as I felt love’s abandonment in my girlhood.” It’s a sentiment that has become more poignant 25 years after it was written.Danger Came Smiling, an exhibition byLinder, the scalpel-wielding post-punk queen of photocollage, runs concurrently. The juxtaposition is superficially odd: Thomas is glitzy exuberance; Linder, surgical cool. Thomas is monumental. Linder is often confined to the dimensions of the magazine from which she slices imagery. Yet the pairing proves surprisingly canny. Both artists are involved in dissecting the feminine image. Both work with soft-porn and fashion photographs. Both use their own body – Linder flexes her back muscles and dons a boxer’s breastplate; Thomas appears in a tiger-print leotard performing wrestling manoeuvres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A suite of works in which ballet positions are disrupted by strange undersea creatures was made, Linder notes, while she was caring for her elderly parents. Self-portraits in which she appears covered in coloured goo relate not only to a fetish known as “sploshing” but also to the soft foods with which elderly people can be spoon-fed.The best works here are a deceptively simple marriage of two impeccably matched elements. A woman leaning to embrace a man instead jams a fork into her eye. A “perfect” Aryan athlete transforms into a piece of industrial furniture. Nudes airbrushed to marmoreal smoothness sprout crystal protuberances. This is work of tremendous restraint. The results are frequently brutal.Mickalene Thomas: All About LoveandLinder: Danger Came Smilingare at the Hayward Gallery, London until 5 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

We’re usually more interested in the popular culture those commercials are busy rudely interrupting. Besides, complaining about the most annoying ones – likethe Confused.com adwhere a succession of people squeeze the mouths into a disgusting O-shape and mime whistling for reasons unknown – only affords them the attention they crave. My primary life ambition is to live in a world where they stop making the Domino-hoo-hoo ads, so I’m hoping that ignoring them may help make that utopia a reality.Still, sometimes it is worth paying attention in the ad breaks. After all, the best examples –Ridley Scott’s 1984-riffing Apple spot, say, orJonathan Glazer’s Guinness ad– elevate the form to something close to art. Great ads tend to linger in the collective imagination, serving as shorthand for the era they belong to. Even when the ads aren’t coming close to doing that, they can still tell us something interesting about what messages our capitalist overlords are trying to get us to swallow. And if you have been paying attention to ad breaks over the past few months, you’ll likely have noticed a recurring message: artificial intelligence, far from being the thing that will ultimately turn society in to a giant pool ofgrey goo, is actually your friend.This trend seemed to kick off over Christmas, when I kept being assailed by a podcast ad for Google’s AI Gemini chatbot (it doesn’t seem to be online, so you’ll have to take my word for it). A generic bloke asks his phone “how do you think my football team will get on this season?” and gets an answer so vague and uninformed it might have beencrafted by Armando Iannucci. Around the same time, a better, if more sinister, example was thevery entertaining Apple adwhere an office drone writes a screed to the co-worker who pinched his pudding from the company fridge, and then uses his MacBook’s AI writing tool to moderate his tone. And there was a Matthew McConaughey-Woody Harrelson ad for Salesforce that suggested AI’s main asset would be in preventing people frombuying lurid fluffy hats.AI’s real coming out party though was during last weekend’s Super Bowl, that rare occasion where people actively watch adverts rather than run a mile from them. America’s biggest sporting event, with its notoriously pricey commercial real estate, has always been a vital proving ground for campaigns, a place where the right ad at the right time might produce somethingzeitgeist-capturing, but where a misjudged spot might provecompany-endingly disastrous. And every so often a theme takes over these Super Bowl ads: in 2000 it wasdotcom companies(mere months before the bottom fell out of the whole sector); and three years ago it wascryptocurrency, hawked by celebs whodefinitelyknew what they were talking about.View image in fullscreenLactose intolerant? Google’s Gemini AI cheese advert.Photograph: Google AIThis time it was AI that celebs seemed to be hawking. McConaughey and Harrelson were back, taking over Heathrow airport for another knockabout affair, while Meta and Ray-Ban recruited two Chrises (Hemsworth and Pratt) and one Kris (Jenner) for anentertaining adriffing on Maurizio Cattelan’s notoriousduct-taped banana artwork. Meanwhile, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, eschewed celebs for an ambitious animated ad that positioned AI in the lineage of world-shaking developments. And, Google had another Gemini ad,this time for the other football, with a clueless boyfriend trying to impress his girlfriend’s family by getting AI to teach him some basic gridiron phrases (not unlike that Armando Iannucci sketch). It was part of a huge advertising push by Google for its AI-enabled products, withads showing the quotidian waysAI can assist everyday folk – although their earlier advert where, thanks to AI, the popularity of gouda cheesewas wildly overstated, was sensibly nowhere to be seen.Even if you aren’t a complete AI catastrophiser, something still feels a little off about how loudly these companies are using these ads to insist that AI is only here to help. There was no promise of a bold new future, no glowing athlete hurling a giant hammer at Big Brother. Instead, with the bold exception of OpenAI’s ad – which at least seemed to be owning the society-altering implications of its product – every ad here seemed to be downplaying AI’s significance: it’s just here to sell cheese, not take over the world. And that makes sense, sincepolling suggeststhat Americans think more harm than good will come from AI. (In the UK,polling around AI is more positive, but still decidedly mixed.) This ad splurge felt less about enticing consumers with a glitzy new product than doing reputation management on something that, like it or not, people will have to start using soon.Much of this reputation management was being done via likable A-listers, which had an irony to it, given that no group of workershas been more vocalthan actors about the threat AI poses to their livelihoods. Right as the Chrises, McConaughey and co were trumpeting the benefits of AI, their union Sag-Aftra wasfighting for video game voice actors, who have been on strike since July over the use of generative AI in the gaming industry. AndAI has inserted itself into this year’s Oscar race, too.Similar tensions are already being felt, or soon will be, across practically every other industry –including, of course, advertising. Most people have their eyes open about AI, recognising its life-changing benefits as well as its pitfalls. But ads trying to minimise or even cutesify this most disruptive of industries is only going to irritate people – almost as much as hearing Domino-hoo-hoo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.But there is now a third way: a cold-water swimsuit, made from thermal fabric to keep your core warmer for longer and lengthen your time in the water. A wetsuit may seem the obvious choice for winter swimming, but many open-water wetsuits won’t offer much warmth in water below 10C, and the effort of putting one on at this time of year when swims are short often isn’t worth it (see more detail below). But is a cold-water swimsuit any different from a standard suit, and are they worth buying? I tested seven of the best to find out.At a glanceBest overall cold-water swimsuit:Zoggs Brave crossback£65 at ZoggsBest sustainable cold-water swimsuit:Finisterre Nieuwland 2mm Yulex long-sleeve£150 at FinisterreBest for simplicity:Zone3 OWS Ti+ thermal high neck costumeFrom £65 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’m an experienced, year-round outdoor swimmer, teacher, guide and lifeguard, and the author ofHow to Wild Swim: What to Know Before Taking the Plunge. I frequently enjoy dips in rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, as well as long-distance swims in the warmer seasons. I also have a decade of experience testing swim kit for outdoor publications.I have first-hand experience of poor-fitting swimwear, with the chafing scars to prove it. This has given me the firm belief that the best thing to wear when swimming is something comfortable that supports your body and is suitable for the type of swim you want to do. Whether that’s a string bikini or a hooded wetsuit, it’s all fine as long as you are safe and happy.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur tester took a dip in each swimsuit in similar weather conditions.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianI took the swimsuits to the same body of water – my local lake,QuaySwim, in Surrey. I ensured the water and air temperature were the same each time–the former a cool 8C, the latter 6C. I made sure I felt fit, well and warm, and that I was swimming in similar weather conditions.But many factors affect whether you feel cold while swimming outdoors – from the level of sunshine, to how much you’ve slept or eaten – so testing couldn’t be an exact science. I experimented with body and skin thermometers, but it was pointless; if my body temperature had dropped, I would be entering hypothermia.I researched suits specifically designed or marketed for cold water, with a mix of brands, materials, sleeve length, neckline and price. While long sleeves can psychologically make you feel warmer, having more wet fabric against the skin can actually make you feel colder. Long sleeves work well when the fabric is snug against the skin, and is thicker or has a technical element to it.After testing,I donated these suits to theEvery Body Outdoorskit pool, a community campaigning for clothing, gear and representation for larger bodies in the outdoors,which I previously wrote about for the Guardian.The best cold-waterswimsuits for womenView image in fullscreen‘The buoyancy lifts you into a prime position for swimming’: the Finisterre Nieuwland 2mm Yulex long-sleeve.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianBest overall cold-water swimsuit:Zoggs Brave crossbackView image in fullscreenWhen Zoggs designed silver-lined suits a couple of winters ago, I was convinced it was a marketing stunt. The lining is a bit like a first aid foil blanket designed to retain body heat: Zoggs claims it helps retain body heat for 60% longer than normal swimwear.Whenever I plunge into cold water my skin turns bright pink due to increased blood flow and dilating blood vessels – it’s this that creates that psychological high. If I wear neoprene gloves during my swim, I see a significant difference in the colour of the skin on my hands compared with my arms. This suit maximises exposed skin with a crossback design, while still keeping your core warm and chest covered with its high neckline.Why we love itI felt warmer, and my skin under the suit was visibly warmer, not red like the skin exposed directly to the cold. My recovery was quicker after I got out, too. The uplifting neon animal print design is perfect for visibility in the grey, low light of winter. I also loved that you can remove the padded cups in the bust area.It’s a shame that …Zoggs hasn’t continued to develop the concept into a long-sleeve suit.Suitable for:outdoor dips and longer swimsMaterial:Ecofeel fabric: 79% recycled micro polyamide, 21% elastane made from recycled plastic wasteSizing:UK8-26£65 at Zoggs£64.99 at Swim the LakesBest sustainablecold-water swimsuit:Finisterre Nieuwland 2mm Yulex long-sleeveView image in fullscreenFinisterre is an expert in keeping water lovers warm. It’s predominately a surf brand, with years of experience designing wetsuits that offer warmth, flexibility and durability – and this suit is no different. Made from Yulex natural rubber, a plant-based alternative to neoprene, it operates like a wetsuit by allowing water into the suit, which then warms up against your skin to keep you insulated. But the swimsuit design enables you to still enjoy the elements on your bare skin.Long sleeves, 2mm fabric and a high neckline keep the upper body and core warmer for longer, and the clever seam placement in the shoulders ensures you get a full range of movement for some serious swimming. If you feel the cold, this suit is ideal: it made a significant difference to my swim, allowing me to spend 20 minutes more in the water than usual at 8C. It wouldn’t be allowed for swimming the Channel or at winter swim events, because of the Yulex fabric and long-sleeve design, but it’s a winner if you want to spend as much time as possible in the water over winter. Finisterre offers similar Yulex products without sleeves and as separates. Everything is delivered in biodegradable packaging, and the brand offers repairs, pre-loved products and the option to trade in old gear.Why we love itAs well as keeping you warm, it gives you more buoyancy in the water like a wetsuit, lifting you into a prime position for swimming. Finisterre has also recently extended its size range to a UK22, and there’s a rental option if you want to try before you buy.It’s a shame that …it’s a little tricky to take off once wet. Bending and flexing to get the suit off solo was a workout, but swimming with a pal will solve that issue.Suitable for:longer swims, paddle boarding, surfing and cool dipsMaterial:85% Yulex, 15% synthetic rubberSizing:UK6-22£150 at FinisterreBest for simplicity:Zone3 OWS Ti+ thermal high neck costumeView image in fullscreenThis classic high-neck suit in sleek black will be popular with traditional swimmers who like simplicity. It has a titanium lining in the front and back panels, which gives thermal benefits to your core. Much like the Zoggs silver-lined suits, this left my arms and legs exposed but kept my core warmer for a little longer.I liked the high neck, which gave coverage against the wind across the neckline and upper back. It also meant less drag when swimming. The lining made a difference, too, and it certainly felt warmer compared with Zone3’s other high-neck suits. The leg cut and body length are ideal, but coverage across the bust was a little lacking, so it didn’t feel as supportive as other suits. An extra inch of fabric could have made all the difference. Those with smaller busts are unlikely to have these issues.Why we love itThe shiny, slick material is stylish and practical and the fabric is designed to retain shape after multiple uses. I really stretched and tugged at it, and also put it through a machine wash, and was impressed that it did indeed retain its snug fit. The long zip is ideal for quick changing after a cool dip.It’s a shame that …it doesn’t come in more colours. A lot of Zone3 swimwear is navy, grey and black.Suitable for:outdoor dips, short swims and wearing under a wetsuitMaterial:body 79% polyamide, 21% elastane; lining 87% polyester, 7.8% polyester ti, 5.2% spandexSizing:UK8-20From £65 at Amazon£75 at Zone3More stock will arrive at Zone3 in early MarchThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Feels fantastic on’: the Chilly Swim Shark Bite.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianChilly Swim Shark BiteView image in fullscreenBest for:thicknessChilly Swim is a small business offering just three designs, all made from limestone neoprene. Limestone neoprene – a non-petroleum-based neoprene – is often touted as an “eco-friendly” alternative to petroleum-based neoprene. However, aslimestone is non-renewable and sourced from mines with a detrimental environmental impact, many still feel it isn’t much better.But I’ve included this Jaws-inspired swimsuit in my roundup because it hooked me in with its performance in the water, and it’s still more environmentally friendly than traditional neoprene, with its smaller production carbon footprint. This suit is 2mm thick – open-water wetsuits are usually between 3mm and 5mm thick – and allows ease of movement, with exposed arms and legs, while keeping your body warm. It’s warmer than a standard Lycra swimsuit, and I liked the lining against the skin, as well as how sucked-in and supportive it felt. It added warmth to my core, but I could still feel the zing of cool water on my skin.Those thermal benefits were, however, cancelled out in front crawl, with the suit allowing a little too much water in at the neck. If you have a more athletic body shape, I don’t think you’d have the same problem, though, and it was fine for a dip and breaststroke. The soft detail around the arms and thighs ensured no chafing in these areas that are prone to friction.Although it’s a wriggle to get on, it feels fantastic when you get there. With every sale, a donation is made to the Rivers Trust, a charity that helps maintain the health of rivers in the UK.It didn’t make the final cut because …it doesn’t have a zip – getting my whole body through a tight neck hole was interesting!Suitable for:wild swimming and short dips;material:90% limestone neoprene, 10% ultra-flex Lycra lining;sizing:UK8-18skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The answer is yes: it’s a great entry-level suit at a good price, and it’s comfortable and true to size.The high neck and long arms kept the chill off my upper body. The zip at the front is robust, and the ideal length to get the suit on and off with ease. The thicker, almost wetsuit-like material kept my core warm and I was able to get a decent 20-minute swim in the water.The arms were a good length. The thicker fabric was great but became heavy when wet, and the suit took a long time to dry. I wouldn’t want to wear it for a competitive race, but for social dips and heads-up breaststroke swims, it worked well. I don’t like padding in my suits, so I love that you can remove the pads.It didn’t make the final cut because …the sleeves are too wide and have too much material, which flapped and caused drag, losing some of the warmth.Suitable for:outdoor dips, longer swims and paddle sports;material:body 80% polyamide, 20% elastane (exclusive of trimmings); lining 100% polyester; mesh 87% polyamide, 13% elastane; padding 100% polyurethane;sizing:UK6-24£45 at Marks & SpencerAlpkit Dulsie long-sleeved swimsuitView image in fullscreenBest for:longer bodiesAlpkit has been a go-to wetsuit brand for swimmers for some time; the Dulsie swimsuit is designed for swims when you don’t want to wear a wetsuit but do want a bit of extra coverage, whether that’s against the elements or for sun protection. It’s made from an ocean plastic waste recycled yarn that’s hard-wearing and durable in chlorine and saltwater.The fabric was thinner than I was expecting, but it did keep the chill off my upper body and arms. This is a no-frills sort of suit, with a basic but effective design. The front body panel is lined, which offers additional core warmth and bust support. Sizing was generous; many swimmers prefer longer body suits, and this would be great if you’re taller or rounder in the middle. The zip is strong and long at the back, with a decent pull, which makes it simple to take on and off on your own.It comes with a three-year bond, which means Alpkit will repair or replace it if there are any issues.It didn’t make the final cut because …the whole suit isn’t lined, which could make a difference to the overall warmth. As soon as the sleeves got wet, it felt cold against the skin and lost the benefit a little.Suitable for:outdoor dips and those with longer bodies;material:78% Econyl, a recycled material made from ocean plastics and nylon waste, 22% spandex;sizing:UK6-20£44.99 at Decathlon£44.99 at AlpkitDavy J bonded long-sleeve swimsuitView image in fullscreenBest for:paddle sportsThe bonded fabric – two pieces of fabric bonded together to make a 1mm-thick material – offers an alternative to neoprene if you have a skin allergy or want a more environmentally friendly choice. This thicker fabric is reversible, and feels great against the skin, with a sculpting effect. It gave me extra warmth around my core, while the long sleeves and high neck kept off the elements.The panelling and seam structure around the armpits and shoulders provide support across the bust while still being flexible enough to allow ease of movement – which can be a problem with sleeved suits. The thumb holes are a great addition and something no other suit offers. They not only keep the sleeves in place, with less drag when swimming but are also great with gloves.Davy J offers a repair service on all suits and an upcycle scheme for when they reach the end of their lives. The latter means you can send back the suit and get 15% off a new one, while your old suit is turned into something else, such as a buckle on another suit.It didn’t make the final cut because …the leg cut is so high. But I know many swimmers who love a high cut for ease of movement around the thigh joint when kicking or for paddle sports.Suitable for:outdoor dips, longer swims and paddle sports;material:78% Econyl, a recycled material made from ocean plastics and nylon waste, and 22% elastane;sizing:XS-2XL£160 at Davy JWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Swimwear should feel like a second skin.’Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianThere’s a lot of opinion in swim circles about what you should wear in cold water. For cooler temperatures, wetsuits are an obvious choice. Designed to provide thermal protection when wet, they work by letting water into the suit, creating a thin layer of water between the rubbery fabric and the skin, which then warms up and insulates the swimmer.Purists will tell you it’s not “wild” swimming if you’re in a wetsuit, and those chasing the endorphins from a cool dip won’t want a wetsuit to get in their way. You could also argue that the time it takes you to get in and out of a wetsuit isn’t worth it when weighed up with the time you will spend in the water at this time of year. As a result, many swimmers prefer a normal swimsuit or trunks and accept that an outdoor swim will be more of a dip. The swimsuits above offer a third option.Ultimately, swimwear should be snug, but not tight. It should feel like a second skin, but not leave red marks when you take it off. But if it’s too loose, it will fight with the water, causing drag and discomfort. A lot of wet material against your skin can make you colder, too.When it comes to design or style, swimwear should suit the type of swimming you aim to do. If you’re having a leisurely dip, most swimwear will be fine. But for longer, more physically demanding swims, seek simplicity and function over style. Zips need to be strong and not cause chafing. Thicker straps will support bigger busts, while thinner or cross-over straps can allow for greater movement of the shoulders. Padded swimwear will soak up water, drag while swimming and feel colder, but it’s down to personal preference and whether you like padded cups for extra support or comfort. Recycled fabrics are more resistant to chlorine and saltwater, and they are more sustainable.All swimwear is machine-washable, but to lengthen the life of your swimsuits you should rinse them in cool water after each use, especially if you’ve been swimming in chlorine or saltwater. You only need to machine-wash every two to three wears, and even then a cool wash will be good enough. Never tumble dry swimwear.Winter running gear: our top training essentials to help you conquer the coldRead moreWhat you should know about cold water swimmingIn my experience, swimmers are often more resilient, productive and positive when regularly swimming outdoors. It canimprove your mood, relieve stress and maybe even have a positive effect onimmune function. If you want to try cold water swimming for the first time, it can be a good idea to start when the water is warmer in late summer and continue as the water and weather cool.All water below body temperature will feel cold, and understanding how your body responds to this is essential for swimming outside. When entering cold water, cold-water shock can be an instant reaction – this is when you gasp, take a large breath and find it hard to exhale or control breathing. To overcome this, it’s best to enter water slowly, but consistently.Look for a swim group, open-water coach or supervised venue. There are plenty of experienced swimmers and experts in the UK to help get you started.Swimmingat a supervised venue will not only provide lifeguard cover when swimming but also give you a community of swimmers to help you get started.While there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence andsome studiessuggesting cold water can aid overall wellbeing, if you’re merely enduring winter swimming rather than enjoying it, ask yourself whether it’s really worth it for you.Ella Foote is a freelance journalist,author, editor and outdoor swimming expert.

In particular, the pair ofboot-cut jeans worn by the American rapperas he commanded the stage. But while those came from the luxury fashion brand Celine and cost £830, the scores of backup dancers surrounding him wore a high street label – to be precise, £19.90 oversized T-shirts and long-sleeved tops from Uniqlo.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It is another big coup for the Japanese-founded retailer that has steadily grown its presence on the British high street with 20 stores and counting. For a brand previously seen as a little boring, all beige and greige logoless casual wear, it is quite the vibe shift. It now infiltrates the wardrobes of everyone from gen Z youngsters who love its cargo joggers andcult crossbody bag, to their grandparents who rave about its Heattech thermals and affordable cashmere jumpers.View image in fullscreenItems from the Uniqlo:C capsule collection.Now it has its sights set on winning over the fashion world. Last September,Uniqlocemented its status as a serious player when Clare Waight Keller became its creative director. The British designer previously held stints atCalvin Kleinand Chloé and during her three years as artistic director at the French fashion house Givenchy designed the Duchess of Sussex’s wedding dress. The fact that a high street retailer had persuaded one of luxury’s most influential fashion designers to decamp from a world of catwalk shows and celebrity-fronted campaigns speaks volumes about Uniqlo’s sway. It also points to a changing definition of what luxury means.Waight Keller says part of the lure of Uniqlo is that it appeals to everyone. “We have to remember there are a lot of people who don’t have a lot of money. As much as they aspire to buy luxury, it’s not realistic for everyone to afford it. I have a mission in me to bring the quality of design that you would get from luxury to a broader audience. I think everybody deserves to wear something beautiful.”Uniqlo’s appeal has not always been so widespread in the UK. Founded in Hiroshima in 1984, it ended up closing 16 of its stores within 18 months of first launching on the British high street in 2001 due to poor footfall.Although it has tried to distance itself from fast fashionclaiming it does not chase trendsand offering in-store repair and recycling, Uniqlo still produces a staggering60m items annually. On the ethical fashion Good On You app it scores a “it’s a start” – the same rating as H&M.View image in fullscreenMenswear from the Uniqlo:C range, a capsule collection of elevated pieces.Two decades after its UK launch, Uniqlo has found its stride. Its £69.90 down jackets are a fraction of the cost of a £360 North Face puffer while its limited-edition collaborations with designers including Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson sell out within minutes. Joy Montgomery, the commerce editor at British Vogue, says the fact it “delivers on form and function without breaking the bank” sets it apart from other high street stores. “Sometimes we just want a staple that comes in five colourways and has a handy pocket for our AirPods.”Nearly six months into her creative director role, which includes overseeing Uniqlo’s mainline and Uniqlo:C, a capsule collection of elevated pieces, the Waight Keller effect is beginning to trickle down into stores. She has expanded the colour palette by introducing sharp citrus shades and romantic pinks to its cashmere and linen ranges.Timelessness is important. The T-shirts worn by Lamar’s dancers launched seven years ago. Waight Keller still wears clothes she bought from the brand 15 years ago. To maintain relevancy she is focused on proportions and fine-tuning silhouettes. A “track suit” consists of trackpants and a blazer. Tops and dresses come with in-built bras while shorter skirts include built-in shorts. Waight Keller is particularly pleased with acrepe jersey dresswith spaghetti straps and a cutout back detail that does not require a bra.“In the summer women can feel uncomfortable in the heat,” Waight Keller says. “I wanted to eliminate that. You don’t need to find things that work together. You can just put one thing on.” It is this type of pragmatic approach that is sure to win over fashion shoppers lamenting the lack of female-led luxury houses. As for It bags, following the success of her pocketed tote bag that can fit a laptop and sold out in 10 minutes upon launch, there is another£24.90 version on its waywith even more pockets.This function-first approach partly comes from Waight Keller’s inspiration – people-watching at airports. “There is no fixed demographic. So functionality and simplicity are key. There is a purist approach that is rooted in Japanese culture. Everything has a reason. There is nothing superfluous.”Uniqlo essentialsRound mini shoulder bag, £14.90Deceptively small looking, this can fit everything from your phone to arotisserie chicken.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: PR IMAGECotton crew neck T-shirt, £19.90Features a special AIRism fabric to keep wearers, including Super Bowl dancers, cool.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No, it’s “a journey of the senses”, over tandoori duck seekh kebab, sea basspollichathuand a few fancy cocktails, to help you transcend your earthly confines. This is “more than just a meal; it’s an ascent to new experiences”, proclaims the website.Being a huge fan of restauranthyperbole, I love it when dinner promises to change me metaphysically. The website goes on to refer to Vatavaran’s owners, chef Rohit Ghai and Abhishake Sangwan, as “visionary”, and in doing so strays perilously close toDavid Icketerritory. Elsewhere on the site, Himalayan analogies are stretched like climbing ropes off the side ofNanda Devi: the show kitchen private dining room, we are told, is “a dynamic, participatory journey through the flavours of the mountains”, but I’d rather not –PDRsare the last refuge of the scoundrel, after all.View image in fullscreen‘Peculiar’: Vatavaran’s indori poha chaat.Vatavaran is on multiple levels in a gargantuan, higgledy-piggledy former cocktail bar on Beauchamp Place; one server informed me randomly as I entered that “the loos are in the basement”, clearly preempting my later lostness. A great deal has been spent on abstract art and fancy wallpaper to make the place look pretty, though if this clonking behemoth of real estate were in Huddersfield rather than Knightsbridge, it would make a pretty good Wetherspoons. The menu, meanwhile, may claim to cover the Indian subcontinent, but the likes of beetroot chops and kidney bean kebabs seem far more modern and experimental than wildly authentic.The main dining room was a bit chilly, and our table for two was blasted further by an aircon vent that helpfully rearranged my fringe while I ate a stale trio of poppadoms with pleasant mango and tamarind chutneys; a whole £7 was added to our bill for that particular treat. At first, we were the only guests, but our server was flummoxed even by that. What puzzled me more, however, was the large, apparently out-of-operation cocktail bar through which all our food emerged. Was there a dumb waiter behind it, delivering plates up from the bowels of the building? At any rate, there was no smell of cooking at all, so for all I knew they were maybe ordering things in on Deliveroo.Two plates appeared over on the bar: first, that kidney-bean kebab, which turned out to be minced, unseasoned beans shaped into a patty, fried and garnished with cremated lotus root. It was grimly edible, but only if you wereveryhungry. Then a bowl of peculiarindori pohachaatin which wet, structureless dumplings were hidden in a tamarind sauce. Not offensive, but also not all that nice, either.Our table for two was blasted by an aircon vent that helpfully rearranged my fringe as I ate a stale trio of poppadomsAnother small plate arrived,dal bati, a mixed lentil dal with hard bread balls. Bati should err on the chewy, but these were largely inedible and the haphazardly seasoned dal felt as if it had recently been reheated. Was there even a chef in the building? Granted, the earlier overcooked lotus root did suggest that someone, somewhere, had access to a fryer. I wrapped my scarf up tight and gestured amiably at the servers, pointing them to the air-conditioning unit that was still piping cold air at my neck. They looked at me blankly, without being quite able to crack my code.Two prettily presented non-alcoholic cocktails appeared with a flourish, so they clearly had a bartender in the house – atejwithTajín, passionfruit and grapefruit, and a delicatetulsimade with cucumber, lemongrass, basil and apple. If only such artistry had extended to anything in the dining room. By this point in our meal, the place had started to fill with what seemed to be rich tourists pointed here by posh local hotels. “Save yourselves!” I stopped myself from shouting. “Run!”View image in fullscreen‘Cremated’: Vatavaran’s lotus kidney kebab.Fancy-pants places such as this make me rather irate, because they exist largely only in the meetings before their opening dates. “Behold, our extremely lofty cookery. Customers will be jolly happy to have us.” But by the time our mains arrived, I had lost all impetus for eating. A £24 tandoori lamb chop with black cumin was spongey, overcooked and suspiciously un-tandoored: there was no discernible charcoal smell, nor that unmistakable scent of sizzling lamb fat. Butter chicken, by contrast, was a safer option, and a welcome one, because it had a pleasing and vibrant sunset-coloured sauce finished with fenugreek. The accompanying roti, on the other hand, were stale and unlovable.I pondered a lot about Vatavaran in the days after our visit. Was there anything else I should have ordered? Fish cooked on a rotisserie (or so the menu said), or the lobstermoilee? Then again, if even your dal is uninspiring, there’s no way I’m chancing you making a decent coconut-cream sauce to go with lobster. TLDR: Vatavaran may be a Himalayan dining experience, but I’d rather be rescued from the Mera Peak with missing toes than eat there again.Vatavaran14-15 Beauchamp Place, London SW3, 020-4618 3971.

Spread the rhubarb mixture on a baking tray, roast for 12–15 minutes, or until slightly tender, then remove and leave to cool.While the rhubarb is roasting, put the tapioca in a sieve and rinse under cold running water until it runs clear. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, then add the tapioca and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10–15 minutes, until the pearls are mostly translucent. Drain through a fine-mesh sieve, then rinse under cold water to stop the tapioca cooking further.In another saucepan, heat the milk, cream, vanilla pod and half the sugar over a medium heat, stirring to prevent the milk from catching. In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar. When the milk mixture is steaming and just below boiling, slowly pour two-thirds of it into the egg yolk bowl, whisking continuously. Tip the yolk mixture into the saucepan with the remaining milk and cook, stirring, over a low heat for five to seven minutes, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon; don’t let it come to a boil. Take off the heat, then strain through a fine sieve to remove the vanilla pod and any lumps.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Stir the custard into the cooked tapioca, then spoon into four bowls.

On stage, I was tremblingElizabeth MoyaFri 14 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 11.42 ESTShareThe first time I sang karaoke was in a bar in my home town of Curicó inChile. I sang Hero by Mariah Carey. I remember being so nervous with everyone watching me. I was only 17, but I won. The prize was meant to be a trip to the Dominican Republic, but nothing happened in the end. I wouldn’t be surprised if it wasn’t true anyway – it was a bit of a dodgy bar. But, 15 years later, a karaoke competition finally sent me abroad.Since that first time singing Mariah, karaoke has become a part of me. I sing every day: in my room, in the shower, when I’m cleaning the house. I love all kinds of music: rock, hip-hop, cumbia.I never thought I could turn it into a career. I used to do odd jobs in hospitality, but about seven years ago, when I was 26, I began uploading videos of myself singing cover songs online. I soon got my first booking to perform in a local casino. Since then I’ve been singing professionally in casinos, restaurants and malls across Chile. It’s been great training for karaoke. I sing everything – pop in English, pop in Spanish, Latino rock, English rock, to rancheras and reggaeton.Five years ago, I started applying for singing competitions. I was a semi‑finalist in The Voice Chile in 2022. Last year, I won the heats of theKaraoke World Championshipsin Chile, making it to the finals in Finland.Karaoke is about expressing your feelings through the song. I’m not good at talking about my feelings, but I can do that through other people’s lyricsWe all know karaoke as a fun activity to do with friends on a night out, but competitive karaoke is all around us – look at singing contests such as The Voice or The X Factor. In competitions, judges are not only evaluating your skills as a singer, but also how you interpret the song, the intonation, the diction and your mastery of the stage.I think winning at karaoke depends on the songs you sing – you have to be strategic and choose ones that show off your range. Although I don’t speak English, at the championships I choseNever Enough from The Greatest ShowmanandWhitney Houston’s I Have Nothing, as these songs have a wide vocal range.For me, karaoke is about expressing your feelings through the song. I’m not good at talking about my feelings, but I can do that through other people’s lyrics. And that’s what you have to do to succeed at karaoke. The big difference between a singing competition and a karaoke competition is that, in karaoke,you have the lyrics on a screen. Still, it’s a world away from a late-night bar when you’re clowning around with friends. I still love that kind of karaoke, though I’ll make sure my friends get the chance to sing more than me.The Karaoke World Championships finals took place on a cold afternoon in Turku, Finland, last October. It was my first time out of Chile, so it all felt like a dream. Everything was really surprising to me – the language, the weather – but in a good way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I also noted the vocal arrangements, whether there’s staccato, belting or some twang. I paid attention to every detail.At the finals, I had to sing four songs in front of judges and a live audience, and I was up against participants from 42 countries. I was so nervous. I almost didn’t want to go out on the stage because I felt like I was going to cry. I thought, what am I doing here? I was the only person who couldn’t speak English, so people had to translate for me. My body was trembling, but I could hear Chileans chanting in the audience, which was really comforting. The judge gave me 429 points – putting me in first, ahead of the second-place scorer at 417.When they announced that I had won, I was in shock. My heart was beating fast and I felt full of happiness. All the competitors were excellent singers who have successful careers in music, so I couldn’t believe it.It might sound strange, but even today I still struggle to acknowledge the achievement – I get impostor syndrome. Though now, after all these years, I’m starting to record music I’ve written myself. Still, it’s amazing that karaoke is a big part of my life – and to think that it all began with Mariah Carey.As told to Naomi Larsson PiñedaDo you have an experience to share?

Raf thinks the cost is unjustifiable. Your decision will put one of them out of the pictureFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonFri 14 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 08.17 ESTShareThe prosecution: MeeraI’ve been collecting art from all over the world for years, and cheap frames don’t fit or look goodI’ve been living with my boyfriend Raf for a year now, and we’ve been putting off framing our art. I am a writer and Raf is a designer. We don’t struggle financially but we have to budget.I’m looking after the smaller pieces of decor in our flat, such as cushions, plants and colour schemes, whereas Raf is very handy with making and upcycling furniture that we find in markets. We’re both quite creative and thrifty. But when it comes to spending money on framing art, Raf has this huge block.I’ve been collecting pieces on my travels for years. Before I met Raf I’d bought paintings in Vietnam, street art in Brazil and other bits online. I’ve suggested taking them to a picture framer and getting them framed professionally, in colours that match our home, but Raf won’t hear of it. He says: “Let’s just get some cheap frames from Ikea and be done with it.”Raf says we have more pressing things to tend to in our home, but what’s more pressing than stuff you look at every day?But those frames won’t fit my art properly and are also limited in style. Custom frames elevate your art and make it look more expensive. Yes, they cost a lot of money, but once it’s done it will last for ever.Raf says we have more pressing things to tend to in our home, but what’s more pressing than the stuff you have to look at every day? Some of my favourite pieces are in old, cheap frames and others have yet to be put up.Raf suggested we put up the pieces that are already framed, but I hate the old frames. He also suggested sticking the other pieces to the wall temporarily with Blu-Tack, which I refuse to do. One time he put a landscape of mine that I bought in Costa Rica in this awful antique gold frame he got from work. It didn’t look good – it didn’t fit the art. I took it out and we had a disagreement over it.Raf works with a lot of carpenters so I suggested he ask them to help him with the framing, but he said he doesn’t want to look “cheap” at work.We’ve opened a joint account since moving in together. I don’t want to betray Raf’s trust by spending a chunk of the money on framing if he thinks it’s a bad idea, but I am really tempted.You be the judge - send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: RafGood art speaks for itself, regardless of the frame, and the prices we’ve been quoted are madnessMeera is making me sound like an uncultured swine here, and that’s not the case. I do love and appreciate art, and as a furniture designer I love good craftsmanship. I just think custom framing is expensive for what it is.Meera has about 12 pieces that she wants to hang up in our home. To get the type of frames she likes, we were quoted £700. For picture frames! It’s madness. Meera says it’s worth it but I disagree. If art is good, it can speak for itself. It doesn’t need fancy frames. Something subtle that fits properly is fine.I found a gold frame at work recently and surprised Meera by placing one of her pieces in it, but she hated it. Meera said I’d made the artwork look “tacky” and that only custom frames would do. I was just trying to help. I suggested getting frames off Etsy to save money but she insists on getting them all custom designed.Meera threatens to get it done by withdrawing money from our joint account. I think it’s a betrayal of our trustWe have been together three years, and this is our first time living together. We’ve put off a lot of decorating due to lack of cash and are doing the urgent bits first. Meera and I are both creative but you learn a lot about each other when you share a space. I didn’t foresee art and interiors being an issue as we pretty much have the same taste in design.This is more of a finance issue: I think frames are unnecessarily expensive, Meera sees them as a non-negotiable items. She keeps threatening to get them done by withdrawing money from our joint account. I think that’s a bit of a betrayal of trust.Meera has been on at me to take the pictures into work to get the carpenters to make the frames, but 12 is just too big an ask. They would probably do them for free and I just can’t ask them to do that. It’s a new job and I don’t want to look tight.Perhaps we can do the frames once we’ve saved up a bit. I’d like to put the art that is already framed up as it is – the frames work fine. The other bits can be Blu-Tacked for now, and wait until we are richer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The only thing Raf is guilty of is proposing using Blu-Tack for the unframed art – better to keep it off the wall until it has a frame to avoid damaging or marking both the wall and the art.Dominique, 32Raf’s suggestion of getting some of the pieces custom-framed now and leaving others until later sounds like a sensible compromise. If Meera disagrees, she should just foot the bill herself.Jihea, 30Raf should acknowledge that the frame contributes to the art and is a nice touch. However, the cost of custom-framing these pieces is far too expensive and buying them behind his back would be a betrayal of trust. A compromise could be to use custom mounts, which ensure the art fits in a standard frame.Andy, 38£700 is a lot of money and bespoke frames are a luxury. Raf has offered a compromise – spending money on a few bespoke reframings and saving up for others. Meera should accept this middle ground.Duncan, 52Meera is being ridiculous. £700 for custom framing is completely unnecessary. That doesn’t mean Ikea frames are acceptable.

Here we examine what has changed and how far the rollback might go.Which sectors are dropping DEI?So far, the most prominent names to announce changes are from the US finance and tech sectors. This week, the bank Goldman Sachsscrapped a policythat stipulated it would only take on a company’s initial public offering if it had at least one board member from a diverse background.The consultancy firm Accenture said last weekend it wasending the global diversity and inclusion goalsit set in 2017, along with career development programmes for “people of specific demographic groups”. Earlier this month, Google said it was reviewing some diversity initiatives andscrapping a goalto hire more employees from historically underrepresented groups, and has sinceremoved referencesto events including Black History Month, LGBTQ+ Pride and Women’s History Month from its online and mobile calendars.Is this a new trend?View image in fullscreenWall Street banks last year became some of the first firms to publicly distance themselves from diversity initiatives, including Goldman Sachs.Photograph: Joan Cros/NurPhoto/Re/ShutterstockNo, rightwing campaigners have been pushing for some time for organisations to scrap the more inclusive policies that were created in response to the protests after the police killing ofGeorge Floydin 2020, claiming they result in “reverse discrimination”.Those efforts moved up a gear after aUS supreme court rulingin 2023 that banned affirmative action in university admissions decisions, prompting Conservative groups tolaunch a wave of legal action against companiesover their diversity programmes.Last year, Wall Street banks became some of the first companies to publicly distance themselves from diversity initiatives, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, opening up the diversity programmes previously aimed only at people from ethnic minorities.The change gathered pace after Trump’s election in November, with a swathe of firms dropping DEI in the run-up to the president’s inauguration on 20 January, includingWalmart,McDonald’s, Ford,AmazonandMeta, which alsooverhauled its content moderationto remove restrictions on topics such as gender and immigration.Has it reached the UK yet?So far the main impact of the changes in Britain have been on users of Silicon Valley-based tech and social media platforms. The policy changes have also prompted some splits within organisations that operate in both countries, as their US and UK arms follow different paths.This week, the consultancy and accounting firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government toremove pronouns from their emails, while also announcing the end of its DEI programme.However, the boss of Deloitte UK informed staff its British operations would remain “committed to [its] diversity goals”. A memo from Richard Houston said changing government priorities in the US would not change its “commitment to building an inclusive culture” at its UK arm.Employment lawyers have warned that if companies embrace the Trumpian trend they could open themselves up to legal risk in the UK. British companies have “always had a merit-based approach” for hiring employees, as affirmative action does not apply, said Lucy Lewis, a partner at the law firm Lewis Silkin.However, she warned that “it is a big unknown if the federal government will require contractors who they are working with to go further and row back on diversity and inclusion in other ways”, which could create problems when working with some US firms.UK employers will continue to be required by law to report on certain diversity metrics, such as the requirement to disclose the representation of women and ethnic minorities on the board and in the executive teams of listed companies.Companies which announce changes to diversity schemes may also find it harder to recruit younger staff, according to multiple surveys of workers belonging to Gen Z – born between 1997 and 2012 – which have highlighted theirdesire to work for organisations that align with their values.“They only want to join companies which they see pay attention to these issues,” said Pavita Cooper, UK chair of the 30% Club, which campaigns globally to boost the number of women in boardrooms and in the leadership of companies. “The war for the very best talent has not gone away, and this is what matters to them.”Who is fighting back?View image in fullscreenThe GMB unions ‘worried’ that ‘multinational companies will bring a rightwing, regressive, anti-worker approach to their UK operations’.Photograph: Andriy Popov/AlamyTrade unions oppose the shift but are concerned that international companies may follow US policies, even within their UK businesses. The GMB union said it was worried that “multinational companies will bring a rightwing, regressive, anti-worker approach to their UK operations”, said Eleanor Saunders, GMB’s equality and inclusion organiser.“Employer diversity initiatives often don’t push hard enough against the causes of workplace discrimination, bias and harassment,” Saunders said. “But they are essential for employers to meet their legal obligations and to go beyond the bare minimum to make work accessible, fair and rewarding for all.”The Prospect union, which represents professionals including engineers, scientists, and tech workers, is concerned that the rollback of schemes in large US-based tech companies could have a direct impact on British employees, despite the different legal framework.It has written to the chair of the UK parliament’s women and equalities committee to ask it to call in tech executives for questioning on the changes.The bosses of large companies including Barclays and Unilever have in recent daysreaffirmed their commitment to diversity programmes, with Barclays’ chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan saying the lender wanted “to provide equality of opportunity” and to “create that inclusive environment”.Meanwhile, the strategic communications adviser Kekst CNC believes many companies are reassessing, not scrapping, their diversity and inclusion policies.“What they’re working towards are policies that are better bound to commercial strategy, and so stronger and more durable,” said Meghan Sheehan, head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability at Kekst CNC.Explore more on these topicsUS newsInequalityUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationGoogleAmazonexplainersShareReuse this content"

It permits expropriation in exceptional circumstances, such as abandoned land, but generally requires “just and equitable” compensation.That did not stop Trump from falsely claiming: “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people VERY BADLY.”The president’s order came after years of lobbying by an Afrikaner rights groups, AfriForum, which caught Trump’s attention during his first term by claiming that white farmers in SouthAfricawere being murdered for political ends and to seize their land. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) civil rights organisation has described AfriForum’s leaders as white supremacists in suits and ties.Trump cuts aid to South Africa over ‘racial discrimination’ against AfrikanersRead moreMusk, who wasraised in apartheidSouth Africa and is now a member of Trump’s inner circle as head of the “department of government efficiency”, hasechoedclaims portraying Afrikaner farmers as victims of racist murders and suggesting that a genocide against whites is imminent.However, the tech billionaire appears to be leveraging that false narrative to challenge affirmative action laws that conflict with attempts to sell his Starlink satellite network in South Africa.Musk has accused South Africa of “openly racist ownership laws” as he applied pressure on the government to exempt Starlink from regulations to uplift people of colour oppressed by apartheid by requiring major business deals to include Black investors. He has rejected a requirement that foreign investors in the country’s telecoms sector provide 30% of the equity in the South African part of the enterprise to Black-owned businesses.AfriForum is campaigning on Musk’s behalf by claiming that Starlink is being prevented from doing business in South Africa because it is “too white” and is subject to “strict race-based criteria”.Musk and the Afrikaner rights group have both sought to turn history on its head by linking the killing of white farmers, land redistribution laws and affirmative action programmes into a common narrative of state-sponsored persecution of racial minorities by the ruling African National Congress.AfriForum has called apartheid a “so-called” historical injustice. Its chief executive, Kallie Kriel, also said thatapartheidwas not a crime against humanity because not enough people were killed during the more than four decades of white minority rule.In May 2018, Kriel and his deputy, Ernst Roets, travelled to the US to lobby the Trump administration in wake of the ANC’s decision to redistribute land and to highlight what AfriForum called the “persecution of South Africa’s minorities”.The pair exploited South Africa’s high murder rate, including of white farmers, to characterise the killings of Afrikaner landowners as racially targeted. They also played on the legacy of President Robert Mugabe in neighboring Zimbabwe whounleashed violenceagainst white landowners in the early 2000s to prop up his unpopular regime byredistributing land.But the deaths of South African white farmers are mostly the result of the country’s high crime rate rather than political targeting by the government. No farmers who have been murdered have then had their land confiscated.In 2018, Kriel and Roets metJohn Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser, Senator Ted Cruz’s staff and conservative thinktanks in Washington.Roets appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show to claim that Afrikaner farmers were being “tortured to death on farms in unusual ratios”. Carlsontweeteda clip of the interview with a caption: “White Farmers are being brutally murdered in South Africa for their land. And no one is brave enough to talk about it.”Trump was watching and tweeted an instruction to his then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to “closely study the South African land farm seizures and expropriations and large scale killing of farmers”.The president went on to call that “a massive Human Rights VIOLATION, at a minimum and is happening for all to see”.Other far-right South Africans pushed similar messages claiming that whites were being victimised by the post-apartheid democratic order. Simon Roche, head of Suidlanders, a group that claims to be preparing the “Protestant Christian South African minority for a coming violent revolution”,appearedon Alex Jones’s Infowars channel claiming that white people in South Africa “expect to see a genocide against them”.AfriForum officials also travelled to New York last July for the US launch of the Afrikaner Foundation to “represent the Afrikaner cause internationally”. Roets was appointed to lead the foundation and appeared as a guestspeakerat the National Conservatism Conference in Washington and addressed New York Young Republicans as well as visiting the US Capitol and making television appearances.The Afrikaner Foundation and AfriForum are both part of the Solidarity Movement in South Africa, also headed by Roets. The Solidarity Movement said last week that it would be holdingdiscussionswith the Trump administration in the near future and expected to hold a meeting at the White House.In September, as Musk’s dispute with the South African government over Starlink ratcheted up, AfriForum launched acampaignon his behalf that claimed Black empowerment laws were leaving white farmers without communications and vulnerable to attack by keeping the satellite network out of South Africa.“By prohibiting Starlink from operating in South Africa because of racist criteria, [the government] is depriving rural communities of a reliable alternative that may save lives,” it said.The statement ends with: “Stop the racism and fight together with AfriForum.”The day after Trump signed his executive order, South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called Musk in an attempt to defuse the row. The country’s communications minister, Solly Malatsi, has suggested an exemption for Starlink from the Black empowerment rules, but other members of the government object and are not likely to look favourably on Musk after Trump’s intervention.Musk and AfriForum are not the only ones who have Trump’s ear on South Africa. Other tech billionaires close to the president were also born in the country, including other members of the “PayPal mafia” raised under apartheid.Trump also plays golf regularly with Gary Player, the renowned South African golfer who in the 1960s declared hissupport for apartheidand its architect, Henrik Verwoerd. Player also described the country’s Black population as “alien barbarians”. Trump awarded Player the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2020.In December, Player took a South African mining entrepreneur, Reon Barnard, for a game with Trump where they were photographed with Musk.Joel Pollak, editor of Breitbart, the alt-right publication, was also born in South Africa and has been tipped as a possible ambassador to the country. Pollak told the South African site,News24, that Trump’s attack on the ANC government was not unexpected and “that the new president has a coherent and long-standing desire to force change” in South Africa.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpElon MuskSouth AfricaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Saturday, all eyes will be on the expected release of three more hostages, according to the schedule laid down in the ceasefire agreement. If Hamas fails to deliver,Israelis threatening to go back to war with the same ferocity that turned cities into rubble over 15 months.Now there is a new, unanticipated blot hanging over Gaza’s already clouded future. Every Palestinian here has heard about Donald Trump’sbizarre plan for the US to “own” Gaza, somehow empty the coastal territory of its 2.2 million people, and build a “Riviera of the Middle East” on their land. No one the Guardian talked to in Gaza treated the threat as a joke, but their reactions were consistent: if one of the most intense, destructive bombing campaigns in history failed to drive them from their homes, then the American real estate tycoon turned president will also surely fail.Trump’s Gaza plan unites jihadist and far-right circles, experts warnRead more“Who is Trump to decide our fate, plan our future, and controlGaza?” said Ayat, a 33-year-old mother of three girls, who returned a week ago to their home in the al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza to find it burned out and partly demolished. “All these plans are nonsense and will fail. Our homes are rubble, and we are living on top of it. How do you expect us to leave?“They want us to go to Egypt, to the Sinai desert. Where will we live there? They want us to go to Jordan, but it is already full of Palestinian refugees. We do not want to live in other countries, and no one wants us to live in their country.”View image in fullscreenPalestinians walk past the rubble of destroyed houses at Jabaliya refugee camp.Photograph: Mahmoud Issa/ReutersAyat has confidence the ceasefire will hold for the simple reason it is in no one’s interest to start fighting again.“If the war was to return in a few days, then why was there a ceasefire?” she asked. “Israel does not want the war to continue because everyone is tired and it has achieved many goals. They are recovering the hostages, and in my opinion they have achieved their goal of changing the Middle East.”She can imagine leaving Gaza for a few years for the sake of her daughters’ education, but says she would return. In the 1948 war that led to the creation of Israel her family was driven out of Kawkaba, a small town in southern Palestine, and fled to Gaza.“We lived with the regret of leaving our home town behind. Will we make the same mistake twice?” Ayat asked. “We live in Gaza, and here we have learned patience, determination and willpower. We have learned how to love life and not fear death. It is true that Gaza has caused us sadness, pain and anger, but we were chosen to live here, and in the end we will be the winners in this place.”She added: “Gaza has been destroyed before and we rebuilt it and we will do it again. This is the best option. No one wants us, and we cannot live anywhere else.”Like Ayat, Mohammed Dabbash, a 26-year-old from the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City, feels confident the ceasefire will last. He works as a news presenter for several media outlets and is also a poet who writes Palestinian anthems. His sister and all her family were killed in the bombings and his family home was left in ruins.He was displaced 10 times over the course of the war and is adamant that no new conflict nor Trump will make him, his family, or the 2 million other Palestinians in Gaza give up their homes and land once more, to make way for a beach resort.View image in fullscreenPalestinians perform Friday prayers at the Great Omari mosque.Photograph: Jehad Alshrafi/AP“Honestly, Trump knows exactly what he is saying, and I don’t take his statements lightly,” Dabbash said. “He is determined to turn Gaza into his building site, but he will not succeed and no free person will comply. Today, we return to the rubble, gathering the remnants of memories, and trying to piece together our shattered souls.“The light of determination will never fade, and we will not become slaves in Trump’s hands.”One of the lessons that the war has taught the Palestinians is that in besieged Gaza there is no escaping the bombs. The supposed “humanitarian zones” were the targets of airstrikes as were the cities. If we are to die, people say, next time we will choose to die in our homes.Eleven-year-old Aseel Somad’s family has just completed the long, painful walk from southern Gaza back home to the Shati camp (also known as the Beach camp), carrying their remaining possessions with them. When they finally arrived they found they were among the lucky few whose house was still intact.“I do not expect the war to return soon, but it could return in the coming years, and that is my biggest fear right now,” Aseel said. “So I am asking the world not to abandon us in the face of this occupation. They have to stop the war from coming back because we are tired and we have lost so much.”He spelled out the principal reasons why Trump’s plans for Gaza would fail. He could imagine some who had lost everything may take up the promise of resettlement, but the neighbouring countries would never accept the mass immigration of Palestinians and most would not want to go in the first place.For the great majority, he said, “the soil of Gaza is better than the best countries in the world”.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesDonald TrumpUS foreign policyMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many worry they could be deported back to the autocratic regime they tried to flee.“We lived in fear and we are still afraid,” said Jesús, who fled Venezuela with his wife and children, crossing through Colombia, the Darién jungle inPanamaand thenMexico, before arriving in Texas in 2021. His wife had worked as a civil servant in Venezuela, and had grown increasingly alarmed by the government’s crackdown on free speech and resisted participating in pro-government demonstrations. That’s when the couple began receiving threats. “They even chased us into our home,” Jesús said.In 2023, his family secured temporary protected status (TPS) – allowing them to legally live and work in the US – and assumed they would be safe for a while.But earlier this month, the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, abruptly decided to end TPS for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans in the US, including Jesús. Within 60 days, the administration plans to strip away the designation, saying that the situation inVenezuelahas “notably improved”.“You can imagine – this came as a shock,” Jesús said. “We suffered a political persecution in our country and now we are doing it here as well.”Send us a tipIf you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of the Trump administration’s temporary protected status decision, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (929) 418-7175.For the past 35 years, TPS has offered immigration status to people who have fled countries experiencing ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster or extraordinary conditions that make it unsafe to return there. What is especially harrowing for many people with temporary protections, now that it’s being taken away, is how easy they will be to find, and deport. In order to secure TPS, they had to submit all their information, their home addresses and histories to the government.Immigrant advocacy groups have been encouraging Venezuelans with temporary protections to find a legal service provider as soon as possible. They have also been providing “know your rights” training. “This is the same information that they’re giving to people who have been long-residing undocumented immigrants – because the same rights will apply to people who have TPS, who may lose their status,” said Laura Vazquez, director of immigrant integration at UnidosUS.View image in fullscreenA family from Venezuela stays on the floor of a makeshift shelter operated by the city at O’Hare international airport in Chicago, Illinois, on 24 October 2023.Photograph: Chicago Tribune/TNSAs the Trump administration tries to ramp up deportations, people with expired protections who have not managed to apply for asylum or other avenues to remain in the US permanently could be easy targets. Jesús and his family are keenly aware of this.Though they have applied for asylum and are awaiting an appointment with the immigration courts in 2027, and would be protected from deportation while their case is pending, Jesús still worries about being caught up in raids. “I hear a lot about how some people don’t have their papers respected,” he said. “We no longer go out alone – only when it’s necessary for work.”His four kids – ranging from preschool to high school-aged – have been feeling the tension too. Amid news that Ice agents are conducting raids in major cities, and will be authorized to enter schools, they have asked him “Papá, they won’t look for us, will they?”Opt out: how to stop tech companies spying on your phone as Trump promises mass deportationsRead moreJesús and his wife have started ordering all their food and supplies online, rather than trying to stop by the grocery store after their shifts. They also started looking into selling their home and their car, so that they will have enough funds to pay legal fees and cover expenses in case they are unable to legally work if their temporary status is taken away.In recent days, they have also started thinking about where else they could go if they are not allowed to remain in the US. More than anything, they want to avoid getting deported to Venezuela. “It’s like they’re trying to throw us into the lions’ cage, as we say in my country,” Jesús said. “Because they would be sending us to persecution and certain death.”Trump had previously tried to terminate protections for people from El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Sudan during his first term. Back then, however, officials proposed allowing those who were affected to keep their protected status for 12 to 18 months before it ended. But that was challenged in court, and people with temporary status were ultimately able to keep their status when Joe Biden took office and rescinded Trump’s TPS terminations.This time around, the administration has moved to end protections earlier, revoking the outgoing Biden administration’s decision to extend the protections for Venezuelans until October 2026. About 350,000 Venezuelans who received TPS in 2023 will lose their temporary status 60 days from when the administration posted notice this month, and another 250,000 who received the status in 2021 will lose the protections in September. The move is likely to face legal challenges.View image in fullscreenA family from Venezuela make the long walk to the bus station from the migrant camp at Floyd Bennett Field, on 19 December 2024 in the borough of Queens, New York City.Photograph: Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis/Getty Images“Once again you have the Trump administration actively trying to strip immigration status of several hundred thousands people who are lawfully present and employed,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, a UCLA law professor who led the lawsuit that blocked Trump from terminating TPS protections during his first term. Doing so will strip away work permits for people who work in industries across the US, and could have a “catastrophic economic impact” in communities across the US.“There’s also the humanitarian impact of telling 300,000 people they should just go back to a country that is, in this case, extremely unsafe. Everybody knows it. I mean, everybody knows Venezuela is a very precarious and dangerous place to live, which is why millions of people have fled,” he added.‘They’re hurting our children, our babies’: US schools on high alert amid Trump immigration raidsRead moreIn Noem’s termination notice, she argued that Venezuelans no longer needed protection, because there had been “notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime”. She also added that it was “contrary to the national interest” to allow TPS holders to stay in the US, claiming that members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua had come to the US, and that US cities could not bear the financial burden of helping new arrivals settle.Advocates questioned the logic of rescinding immigrants’ ability to work and contribute to the communities. Experts have also questioned how the administration could cite improvements, given the state department’s warnings that Venezuela remains in crisis. In recent months, the government of the authoritarian president,Nicolás Maduro, has been rounding up hundreds who protested against fraudulent election results – as well as people who happened to be near protests but seemingly had no involvement in politics. The Biden administration had also issued a $25m bounty for Maduro’s arrest.Immigration advocates are encouraging all Venezuelan TPS holders who might be eligible to apply for asylum in the US as soon as possible – as doing so would allow them their best chance of staying in country. But the process is complex and can be expensive. “It’s not a small thing, especially when the asylum law is so complicated and very difficult to do without an attorney,” said Arulanantham.Mary, a mother of four in Georgia, said she has been having panic attacks and nosebleeds since learning that she and her family could lose their protected status. “I’ve spent six days crying in my bedroom,” she said. “My kids have been crying too. They run into the closet every time they hear a knock on the door.”Her husband was nearly killed in Venezuela, escaping the country with a crack in his skull. Mary, too, was persecuted.As a young law student in Venezuela, she had studied with a prominent opposition leader. “It is impossible to return there,” she said. “If I set foot again in Venezuela I am sure that they will either put my husband in prison or kill him. And they’ll do the same to me.”Parents pull kids from childcare as immigration fears hit US’s youngestRead moreShe had tried to apply for asylum once already, only to discover later that she had been swindled by her immigration lawyer – who had failed to properly file her paperwork, and that she had been issued a deportation order. Her temporary status has been the only thing protecting her. The family now has an appointment with another lawyer at the end of March, but she worries that there won’t be enough time to sort out their affairs before their protected status expires. She worries about where her family could even go, and how she will be able to provide for her youngest son, who is autistic. Even if they do survive returning to Venezuela, she said, how could she possibly find the special education programs her son needs there?“When the secretary of security told us that all of us, all of us who crossed the border were criminals, we were from the Tren de Augua gang, that really affected me,” she said. “After nearly four years here, my husband and I don’t have a single ticket, we don’t have a single fine.”Now, all she can do is wait and hope, she added. “I am clinging to God’s word,” she said. “He’s our only protection.”The names of TPS holders in this piece have been changed to protect their safety and the safety of their familiesExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationNicolás MaduroUS politicsVenezuelaAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And that’s a problem in a part of the restaurant sector known for converting relatively inexpensive ingredients into fast, affordable comfort foods.Egg prices alone havenearly doubledsince December, according to the US Department of Agriculture, and many breakfast restaurants and diners are reeling. Waffle House, a chain with more than 2,000 locations, recentlyannounceda $0.50-per-egg surcharge due to inflation and the worst avian influenza outbreak in history, as tens of millions of birds have been culled to contain its spread.It’s not just eggs that have gone up in price. Coffee is at a 47-year high, driven byclimate disruptionsin Brazil and Vietnam, the world’s largest producers. Thecost of frozen orange juicehas nearly doubled since 2020, due to citrus disease and climate shocks. Flour, too, hasbecome more expensivein recent years, with prices spiking in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Slaughter’s team last increased prices in October 2023 due to inflation. “We’re trying to do everything we can to not raise our prices. No one wants to go into a breakfast place and have to pay $25,” he said.View image in fullscreenJohkiya Pierre prepares an omelette at the Breakfast Brothers in Arlington, Texas, on 12 February 2025.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APExperts and restaurateurs say breakfast spots – which often rely on markups made possible by cheap and versatile ingredients, high-volume sales and loyal customers – are particularly vulnerable to these price shocks. The industry’s conventional wisdom that it’s easier to turn a profit with breakfast food may be in jeopardy.Amy Smith, an economist with the consulting group Advanced Economics Solutions, said the median price increase for popular breakfast items like eggs, coffee, sausage, bacon and orange juice was 19% compared with last year and double 2020 costs.But restaurants risk alienating customers who are already feeling squeezed by inflation. “Companies that are selling these things don’t have a lot of room to increase prices because consumers are already on edge,” Smith said. “If they’re paying triple or quadruple for a dozen eggs every week and coffee is going up, it’s certainly going to impact the decision to go out for a fancy brunch.”Daniel Soloway, director of procurement for the Mecha Noodle Bar chain, said: “Whether you’re a high-end, top-tier bakery in an urban setting or a Starbucks, there are few places to hide for a breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee in 2025.”Restaurants that serve dinner or have larger menus can increase the prices on side items or drinks without raising eyebrows. “At a breakfast place, if the cost of protein – sausage and bacon – is going up, eggs are going up and flour is affecting the cost of bread, there’s no room to improve things for yourself,” he said. “You’re exposed.”Many restaurants are adapting by adding new menu items whose raw ingredients cost less. “Everybody I’m talking to is trying to figure out something that can offset [costs] and give the consumer another option,” Soloway said. But that’s a tricky feat for businesses that have staked their reputations on specific dishes.“Most of what we’re famous for is our pancakes, French toast, waffles, biscuits, egg dishes, eggs Benedict,” said Neil Kleinberg, chef and co-owner of Clinton St Baking Co in New York City. On busy weekends, customers often wait two or three hours for a seat–and those specialties.“So it’s very hard to tell someone to order a side of fruit and avocado and toast.”Like Slaughter, Kleinberg and his team raised prices across the board about a year ago to keep up with inflation: the eggs Benedict that cost $16 a few years ago now cost $18. He anticipates another increase to keep up with current trends.View image in fullscreenWhen Stephen Slaughter’s vendors started charging $8 for a dozen eggs, all six of his restaurants felt the pinch.Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Alamy“We’re getting either price-gouged, or the prices are out of control or fluctuating so much that we don’t know how much to charge for an omelet or an eggs Benedict,” Kleinberg said. He has gone from paying about $100 for a case of 360 eggs to nearly $300.Sam Yoo, the owner of Golden Diner in New York’s Chinatown, has grown accustomed to price fluctuations since he opened his restaurant in 2019. “Every year, we have to talk to our purveyors and [ask]: ‘Why did eggs go up so much this year?’” he said. “It happens all the time.”He acknowledged that the current increases were more significant, but said he was trying to ride them out. “It is going to affect us and our bottom line, but we opened the diner in our community. We still want to make our dining experience as accessible as possible,” he said. “So we’re trying not to knee-jerk react.”He’s relying on that community to weather this latest challenge. Yoo said that restaurants that serve dinner can boost their profits with appetizer and alcohol sales, whereas breakfast shifts make money because they serve a lot of people fast and attract repeat customers.Yoo said that other factors – including the introduction of congestion pricing in Manhattan last month, which he said has inhibited customers from coming in from the outer boroughs – have had a bigger impact on his business’s bottom line than egg prices so far. But like other restaurants, he has adjusted prices to keep up with inflation, about three times over the last six years.“Each time it’s by, like, a dollar here or there. It’s not such a massive change, especially for our regulars, who come in often and know what they want,” he said. For the breakfast restaurant, the flip side of that, however, is that some faithful patrons balk at changes to long-time menu items and prices.Kleinberg, who opened Clinton St Baking Co in 2001, said many New York restaurants had been struggling well before egg prices spiked and even before the pandemic.“Everyone tells me it’s harder and harder to make money in the restaurant business,” he said. Some businesses cut hours or use lower-quality ingredients to deal with higher overhead, such as labor and rent. “The fear is that you’re just not going to be able to make ends meet, no matter how popular you are.”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsOur unequal earthFoodSmall businessEggsBird fluClimate crisisBreakfastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Locals say the flames were still raging as people who had just lost their homes started receiving calls from developers.It’s “plain and simple. I’ve heard it. I’ve said it,” Brandon Lamar, the president of the local branch of the NAACP, said of the slogan. “Everyone that has been displaced – we want them to have the ability to come in and build back.

For decades, it has nurtured Black actors, writers, musicians and activists, while providing a refuge for a racially diverse assortment of creative people who relished their small enclave in the hills north-east ofLos Angeles.The Eaton Canyon fire, which destroyed more than9,400 structuresacross Altadena, Pasadena and Sierra Madre, had a disproportionate impact on Black residents in west Altadena, razing nearlyhalf of the Black households in Altadena, according to early estimates from the University ofCalifornia, Los Angeles (UCLA). A majority of Black homeowners in Altadena are over 65, meaning they are likely to face additional financial and logistical hurdles in the rebuilding process, the UCLA report found.At least one burned-out plot in Altadena was in the process of being sold this week fora reported $550,000, with the realtor in the dealtelling LAistthat the previous owner had been renting the property, and “didn’t want to take on the enormous project of rebuilding the home”.Last Saturday, Murguia and Lamar were both part of a community rally that drew a multiracial crowd of more than 150 people, many wearing different versions of “Altadena is not for sale” T-shirts. Artists set up booths for locals to make paint signs, newly-founded advocacy groups collected contact information from residents affected by the fires, and a drum circle of young artists performed. Murguia, whose embroidery and screen printing business was destroyed in the fire, was working with other local activists to sell T-shirts, and planning to use the proceeds “to fill Altadena with lawn signs to show them we are not selling”, the 30-year-old said.“Now is the time to come together. Now is not the time to sell,” Anthony McFarland, a local pastor whose home was destroyed, told a cluster of cameras at the rally. If older Black homeowners in Altadena were overwhelmed by the task of rebuilding, he urged them to sell to younger Black and Brown families and maintain the fabric of the community. “Keep it in the family,” he said.‘Climate gentrification’ concernsThe economic challenges that Altadena’s current residents face in rebuilding are formidable. Jesse Keenan, a Tulane University professor who coined the term “climate gentrification”, said that rebuilding after a big disaster is expensive and comes with major hurdles, such as supply chain disruptions and significant competition for construction, labor and materials. “Even building code officials – there’s barely enough building code officials,” he said.Rebuilding from scratch usually means that “the cost of housing, and the value of housing, basically doubles,” Keenan said. That can benefit some residents, but it can also result in a community that becomes “unrecognizable or inaccessible to the people who live there”.There is economic pressure to build condos in place of cheaper multi-family rental units that were damaged or destroyed. And even if rental units are built back in similar quantities, he said, prices tend to rise: rebuilt, an older apartment unit that once rented for $1,000 will cost $3,000 or $4,000.California governor,Gavin Newsom, quickly issued executive orders banningprice-gouging for rent in the wake of the firesand attempting to block developers from makingunder-market offers for propertiesin fire-damaged areas.But trying to counteract the broader economic pressures that make rebuilt housing more expensive is “a massive effort of civil society”, Keenan said. In order to rebuild a community and keep it affordable, “You need a multi-sector coordinated effort between the public sector, philanthropy, community development finance institutions, non-profit housing developers and the state, in terms of permitting,” he said. “Basically, it requires subsidy.”This kind of coordinated effort also needs to happen quickly, Keenan said. The faster that people rebuild, “the more likely that the community will be more or less intact”, he said. “The longer it takes for people to rebuild, the more likely it is that people give up, sell, pay off their mortgages with the insurance proceeds.”Doing all of this in Los Angeles, which already has a very expensive housing market and is one of the epicenters of California’s long-running housing shortage crisis, will be extremely difficult, he added.Meanwhile, real estate developers with enormous financial resources will be standing by, ready to buy up properties that individual owners are struggling to rebuild, said Stephanie Pincetl, the director of the California Center for Sustainable Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles.“Equity capital is already doing a lot of financialized development, and they’re not going to stop,” she said. “This is an enormously profitable opportunity.”While homeowners tend to be the focus of post-disaster assistance efforts, Los Angeles renters are also likely to struggle for years to come. The sudden destruction of so many homes has cascading effects on rental markets, said Justin Steil, an urban planning expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.First burned-down plot in Altadena in escrow with $100,000 over asking priceRead more“Climate disasters are associated with a significant increase in rents after the disaster, especially for the lowest income renters,” Steil said. Researchers have also found an increase in evictions not only in the year of the disaster itself, but also the year following. “In places where the median rents are already higher, the increase in evictions is larger,” Steil said.Even before these fires, Altadena had struggled with years of gentrification that had made housing there increasingly unaffordable, and decreased the town’s proportion of Black homeowners. In 1980, 43% of the town’s residents were Black, while today, that number is just 17%, according to the UCLA report.Recentstatisticsshowed that many Black households in the town were already paying a disproportionate amount of their income on housing costs, and that Black applicants made up only 4% of those trying to buy homes in Altadena in 2023.Now, the threat of post-fire gentrification “is probably one of the top three concerns amongst people here,” said Michael Williams, 31, a Black Lives Matter Los Angeles organizer and third-generation Pasadena resident who estimates that more than 30 people he knows lost their homes in the blaze, most of them Black.‘Keep Altadena the Black center it has been’While homeowners whose houses were destroyed have to make individual decisions about whether to sell or to try to rebuild, the outcome of their choices will be deeply shaped by what their neighbors do.“I was just talking to someone that I know who had lost their home, and they were like, ‘I want to rebuild, but I don’t know if my neighbours or folks around me want to rebuild. I don’t want to rebuild in a neighborhood that’s going to be either parking lots, or apartment buildings, and being the only home there,’” Williams said.He and other advocates have been working together to host frank community discussions on the challenges of rebuilding and the resources available to them, including the possibility of creating land trusts to allow residents to sell their property to others within the community. The goal, he said, is “to keep Altadena the Black center it has been”.It’s not just those who lost their homes who have to decide whether to stay in the community as it rebuilds, Williams added. The threat of wildfires is not going away. Williams, his parents, who are in their 60s, and his 100-year-old grandmother all had to evacuate their homes in Pasadena during the Eaton Canyon fire. The ordeal, and its long aftermath, have been particularly difficult for his grandmother, who has had to remember to wear a mask outside, and that it’s not currently safe to drink the water from her tap.His mother and father “are trying to find ways to stay, but also thinking about what their options are”, Williams said. “We don’t know if this will happen again next year, or how bad it will be if it happens again.”“Those are questions that everyone has to ask,” he added. “Even if we do decide to stay, what changes in the way we live do we have to make in order to protect ourselves?”For small business owners, the displacement of local residents in the wake of the fire creates additional challenges. Geoff Cathcart, 48, a barber, lost his home in the fire, but his Altadena-based barbershop, Lawrence and Colbert, survived. But Cathcart’s customers are currently scattered to many different locations, he said, and he knows recovery “is going to be a long process”.Altadena’s Black community demand justice for LA fire victims: ‘I want us to be taken care of’Read moreStill, he showed up to Saturday’s community rally, determined to work to preserve the local culture. “This is one of the few predominantly black communities in southern California that still has a hometown feel,” he said.The importance of community spirit and local organizing should not be underestimated, said Keenan, the climate gentrification researcher.After the major earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2011, the government opened community centers in affected areas, which hosted programming and “brought people of different ages and backgrounds to be in dialogue”.“Little things like that add up,” he said. “It sounds very soft, the emotional healing that comes along with community … but it’s really important, and we know it’s important.”Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresWildfiresCaliforniaWest CoastLos AngelesReal estateUS wildfiresfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gunfire rang out but the rebel forces encountered little resistance. Shops and businesses had long closed, and frightened civilians fled.Bukavu previously fell to soldiers who deserted the Congolese army in 2004 and the capture of the city would in effect give the M23 total control of the Lake Kivu area.Hours earlier, the rebels seized the airport in the town of Kavumu, where Congolese troops had been positioned.Last monththe rebels took Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, in a similar lightning offensive.On Thursday, the group captured Kabamba and the commercial centre of Katana as they advanced south along the N2 road. “M23 soldiers are blocking the road and are heading towards Kavumu – they already have control of Katana,” a local person told Reuters.Airport employees said it had been emptied and in effect closed, with Congolese forces having removed an aircraft and other equipment. Troops were seen heading back to Bukavu in military trucks and on motorbikes laden with mattresses and other belongings.Who are the M23 rebels and why is there fighting in eastern DRC?Read moreCorneille Nangaa, the head of the Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said militias had been attacked and were defending themselves.Congo’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, travelled to Germany to attendthe Munich Security Conferenceon Friday as he seeks international support to end the conflict in eastern DRC.He is not attending this weekend’s annual African Union summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, which is focused on efforts to halt the conflict, with the prime minister, Judith Suminwa Tuluka, taking his place.MapFighting has raged in eastern DRC for the last three years, but the recent surge in violence has prompted international calls for de-escalation and worsened an already dire humanitarian situation. The fighting has destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters around Goma and Minova in South Kivu, leaving 350,000 internally displaced people without shelter,according to the UN.M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led insurgent groups that have operated in the mineral-rich eastern DRC since a 2003 deal was meant to end wars that had killed 6 million people, mostly from hunger and disease. The group is backed byRwanda, which says its primary interest is to eradicate fighters linked to the 1994 genocide. The Congolese government and several UN reports say in fact Rwanda is using the group as a means to extract and then export valuable minerals for use in products such as mobile phones.The fighting has drawn in armies of many countries from within and outside the continent, including those that contribute to a UN peacekeeping mission. Canada announced this week it had withdrawn its military personnel from the force, citing“increasingly perilous security conditions”in Goma.On Thursday a popular Congolese singer was killed in the city while making a music video. The body of Delphin Katembo Vinywasiki, popularly known by his stage name Delcat Idengo, was found along a road near Kilijiwe district in northern Goma in the afternoon, with witnesses saying he died on the spot after being shot in the head.Social media images showed the body of Vinywasiki, dressed in military trousers for the video shoot, lying on the ground.Vinywasiki, whose songs often criticised conflict and human rights violations in DRC, was one of hundreds of prisoners who broke out of a prison in Goma during the M23 advance last month. He had been incarcerated for allegedly inciting people to arm themselves and force UN peacekeepers out of the country and was awaiting trial.The circumstances around the singer’s death are unclear. Patrick Muyaya, a DRC government spokesperson, condemned the killing, which he described as abominable. “Neither horror, nor terror, and even less the untimely resort to arms against innocent civilians will be able to extinguish the flame of resistance in Goma and throughout the country,”he wrote on X.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaRwandanewsShareReuse this content"

In September Dutch police said he remained missing andoffered a €200,000 (£170,000) rewardfor any information leading to his arrest.In a dramatic development last month that sent ripples through international law enforcement circles, Leijdekkerswas seen attending a New Year’s Day church servicewith Sierra Leone’s presidential family, in footage posted on Facebook by the country’s first lady.Reuters, which verified the footage using facial recognition technology, quoted sources who said he had been benefitting from high-level protection in Sierra Leone, one of a number of west African transit points for cocaine trafficking from South America toEurope. Responding to the footage, Dutch prosecutors said Leijdekkers had been living in Sierra Leone for at least six months.But Leijdekkers’ presence can now be dated back to at least December 2022. Multiple sources told the Guardian that he was present at a New Year’s Eve party that year at the Mamba Point resort in the capital, Freetown. The testimony corroborated footage that has been circulating in Sierra Leone of a man who resembles Leijdekkers involved in a fracas at a nightclub. Analysis of the footage showed it had been filmed at Mamba Point. At one point the words “Happy New Year 2023” can be seen on a screen in the background.View image in fullscreenA composite of screengrabs from footage showing a man resembling Johannes Leijdekkers (in yellow) at a nightclub in Freetown on New Year’s Eve 2022.Photograph: social mediaSources also placed Leijdekkers at a house party hosted by a popular Lebanese couple in the Tokeh beach area in December 2023. Footage from the party shows a man resembling Leijdekkers in attendance.Sources said Leijdekkers has been in a relationship with Agnes Bio, a daughter of Sierra Leone’s president, Julius Maada Bio. Leijdekkers and Bio were sitting next to each other in the church service footage from 1 January this year. Bio is the president’s daughter from a previous relationship with Zainab Kandeh, Sierra Leone’s consul to Morocco. She serves as analternate representativeof Sierra Leone on the UN Security Council.The Dutchman was also present at Maada Bio’s farm in his hometown of Tihun during a visit in 2024, according to an official in the presidency who spoke anonymously. Footage of a man resembling Leijdekkers has been in circulation showing him being cheered by villagers as he bent to harvest rice.View image in fullscreenA man resembling Johannes Leijdekkers (in the white top and black cap) seen at a farm belonging to Sierra Leone’s president Julius Maada Bio in Tihun last year.Photograph: screengrabLeijdekkers, who has assumed numerous aliases and nicknames, including Bolle Jos, was sentenced in absentia by a Rotterdam court last June to 24 years in prison for six drug transports totalling 7,000kg of cocaine, an armed robbery in Finland, and ordering the murder of an associate. He was also given a 10-year sentence in absentia by a court in Belgium in September over an attempt to smuggle drugs via the port of Antwerp in 2020.Organised criminal groups have long used west African countries as a staging post for cocaine shipments from South America to Europe. The revelations about Leijdekkers come at an awkward moment for the authorities in Sierra Leone, which last month recalled its ambassador from neighbouring Guinea after seven suitcases containing suspected cocaine were found in an embassy vehicle.A composite image released by Dutch police showing Johannes Leijdekkers in 2011.Photograph: Netherlands PolitieAfter the first reports emerged of Leijdekkers’ presence in Sierra Leone, authorities in Freetown said the president had “no knowledge about the identity and the issues detailed in the reports about the individual in question”. The presidency official told the Guardian that the presidency had been unaware of Leijdekkers’ background untila Reuters report on 24 January. The official gave no further details.In a press conference last week in Freetown, inspector-general of police William Fayia Sellu, said an “open-source investigation” into the footage from 1 January had determined that the “the individual in the pictures being circulated online is called Omar Sheriff”.“Raids have been conducted at specific locations where this individual was said to be present and he has not been found yet,” Sellu said. He declined to say how the identity of the man had been determined or whether Omar Sheriff and Johannes Leijdekkers are the same person.The information minister, Chernor Bah, told the same press conference that investigators were “looking into” whether the man they had identified had been in the country for more than six months. “I don’t think they [police] have established a definite timeframe yet,” Bah later told the Guardian. “At this stage, they are comfortable to say that records for the past six months don’t reveal that person via any formal entry points in our country.”It remains unclear if Leijdekkers is still in Sierra Leone. Last week, the Dutch justice minister said an extradition request had been sent to authorities in the country. A representative for the Dutch justice ministry did not respond to a request for comments.Explore more on these topicsDrugs tradeSierra LeoneAfricaNetherlandsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The network, citing internal government documents, said the flight would include citizens from Cameroon.The Darién Gap, dividing Panama from Colombia, has become a busy transit route for immigrants making their way through Central America en route to the US. In 2023, more than half a million immigrants, mostly from Venezuela, crossed the Darién jungle into Panama. The number reduced to 300,000 last year.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsPanamaAmericasSouth and central AsiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The price hike has been too sharp, which is why we have made this decision.”Japan’s rice stocks drop to lowest level in decades amid tourist boom and poor crop yieldsRead moreThe latest average retail price of a 5kg (11lb) bag of theJapanese staplewas ¥3,688 ($24), according to a government survey, up from ¥2,023 last year.Japan’s government has previously dipped into its rice reserves in the aftermath of natural disasters or crop failures, but this is the first time it has intervened over distribution issues, including when supply chain disruption contributes to rising prices.Japan’s rice stockpiles had already depleted after record-breaking temperatures affected the 2023 crop. Stockpiles shrank again last year, partly due to a rise in consumption caused by record numbers of tourists. Supplies were also hit bypanic buyingin the wake of typhoon and earthquake warnings, forcing some retailers to restrict sales.The price of rice continued to leap after an initial rise last summer, as a shortage triggered by extreme temperatures the previous year sent demand spiralling.The government had hoped prices would stabilise when newly harvested rice went on sale last autumn, but they continued to go up.Although the 2024 harvest was 180,000 tonnes more than that of 2023, distributors secured less of the grain than a year earlier, amid speculation that farmers and wholesalers were hoarding in anticipation of further price rises, the Kyodo news agency said.The stockpiled rice will be sold to agricultural cooperatives and wholesalers in the middle of next month and should be on sale by early April, media reports said. The government has to buy back an equivalent quantity of rice from distributors within a year to prevent prices from collapsing.While the location of rice storage facilities are not disclosed for security reasons, a warehouse in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo opened its doors to the media ahead of Friday’s announcement.That warehouse holds about 20,000 tonnes of rice – enough to fill 300m bowls.Japancan draw on almost 1m tonnes of reserve rice held at about 300 facilities across the country, according to the Asahi Shimbun.The agriculture ministry buys around 200,000 tonnes of rice a year for its emergency reserves and stores it for five years before selling it, mostly as animal feed, the newspaper added.Japan began stockpiling rice in 1995 after a major rice crop failure two years earlier sparked panic buying.Agence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsJapanRiceAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the country’s young people are slaying another sacred cow associated with Friday’sorgy of commercialised romance: one-sided gift giving.Traditionally, women are expected to buy gift-wrapped chocolates for the men in their working lives, usually senior colleagues and others to whom they feel indebted – a tradition calledgiri choco, literally “obligation chocolates”.But the age ofgiri chocoseems well and truly over. Just 12.5% of people said they planned to give sweets to colleagues on Valentine’s Day – the lowest proportion on record – according to a survey by Nippon Life Insurance. That compares with almost a quarter in 2020, the year the coronavirus outbreak became a global pandemic. More than 70% of those surveyed said they thought the custom was “unnecessary”.Another intriguing phenomenon has also emerged this year, with an increasing number of teenage boys viewing Valentine’s Day as an opportunity to reciprocate rather than wait until White Day on 14 March, when men are traditionally expected to return the favour.Japan asks young people why they are not marrying amid population crisisRead moreOne survey reported in the Weekly Playboy magazine found that almost a third of girls attending middle and high schools had received Valentine’s gifts from boys in recent years.“Today’s teenagers and people in their 20s tend not to be bound by gender stereotypes or ‘romantic supremacy’, so Valentine’s Day is no longer just a day for women to confess their feelings to men,” Hikari Asahina, the president of seamint, a market research form focusing on gen Z, told the magazine.Thesoaring price of cocoa beans, following poor crops in Ivory Coast and Ghana, has also blunted enthusiasm for lavishing chocolate on multiple recipients, some or all of whom may not be the object of the giver’s desires.The average price of a chocolate bar has risen from just under ¥100 (65c) before tax in 2022 to ¥150 today, according to Intage, a market research company. “Given the continuing price hikes, we expect people this year to juggle expenses, such as by reducing the amount of ‘obligatory’ chocolates they buy,” the firm said.Consumers spent an average of ¥3,818 ($25) on Valentine’s Day treats this year, a separate survey found – down from the ¥4,008 spent last year.The Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported that supermarkets have replaced more expensive department stores as the preferred place to buy Valentine’s chocolates.In a poll of women by the market research firm Nippon Information, 31% of respondents said they would buy chocolate from a supermarket, followed by department stores on 29%, while 21% said they would make their own.Don’t swipe, write: Japanese city encourages daters to send love lettersRead more“This is just a theory, but given the soaring prices of food and daily necessities … we believe there is greater demand for supermarkets, where the prices of Valentine’s Day products tend to be lower compared to department stores,” a Nippon Information spokesperson told the Mainichi.Giving chocolate as Valentine’s Day gifts took off commercially inJapanin 1958, when a confectionery firm held a special sales campaign at a department store in Tokyo. In 2019, the Valentine’s market was worth ¥126bn before shrinking slightly due to the pandemic.The pressure to avoid causing offence by spending thousands of yen on chocolates for colleagues has prompted some firms to ban the practice in recent years, amid rising awareness ofharassment in the workplace.Instead, more women are buying chocolates for themselves –jibun choco– or splashing out onoshi-choko: chocolates accompanied by photos and merchandise belonging to their favouriteoshi(character or idol) that they post on social media.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificValentine's DayWomenYoung peopleChocolatenewsShareReuse this content"

CassidyEducation reporterFri 14 Feb 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 20.11 ESTShareAcademics have accused the education minister of “arbitrary political interference” in the Australian Research Council after requesting the body’s board investigate the fellowship of a prominent academic and Palestinian advocate.Randa Abdel-Fattah, the recipient of an ARC Future Fellowship and an academic at Macquarie University, has faced sustained criticism from the Coalition, some Jewish bodies and media outlets for a series of controversialcomments, including alleging Zionists had “no claim or right to cultural safety”, and posting “May 2025 be the end of Israel” in the new year and changing her profile picture to a picture of a Palestinian paratrooper after the 7 October attacks.On 31 January, the education minister, Jason Clare, wrote to the ARC board requesting they investigate her $870,000 research grant, commissioned to research Arab and Muslim-Australian social movements, as a “matter of priority”.Referendum needed for Dutton’s call to toughen citizenship-stripping laws, expert saysRead moreIt followed a speech by Abdel-Fattah at an anti-racism symposium headed by the Queensland University of Technology’s Carumba Institute, where she revealed she had refused an ARC requirement to hold an academic conference as a condition of her grant, instead inviting women to contribute revolutionary quotes.Abdel-Fattah said she did not want to fulfil her ARC grant requirements in a “traditional way”.“Part of my funding is to hold a traditional academic conference, and I thought, ‘No, I’m not going to do that’,’’ she said.“I took some of the funding, and instead of holding a conference, I did … a Jars for Preservation workshop, where I invited women … of all different backgrounds … to send me their most beloved quotes from their warriors, their feminist women, their scholars, people who have inspired them and given them that revolutionary zeal and nourished them.“I printed it out in coloured paper, everybody got a jar, and we sat down as a workshop and we cut.”Abdel-Fattah’s projectis described as the first study of “a neglected but constitutive part of Australia’s social movement history: Arab/Muslim-Australian social justice activism”, building new knowledge about how the community has “struggled against external systems and internal conflicts to build a socially just future in multicultural Australia”.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailClare said grant recipients were “required to follow the rules” set out in their agreements. “The government has asked the ARC Board to ensure that this is the case,” he said.But the president of the Australian Historical Association, Michelle Arrow, said Clare’s directive represented a “new kind of political interference” in ARC grants.In November 2023, Clareintroduced legislationthat would prevent ministers from approving competitive grants, after areview into the bodyfound trust had been “dramatically eroded” by controversial grant decisions made by former Coalition ministers.The review called for more “checks and balances” on the power of ministerial intervention, limited to “the extraordinary circumstance of a potential threat to national security”.Clare said at the time any future minister who tried to politicise the ARC would be subject to the scrutiny of parliament, adding the body had been “bedevilled by political interference” which had “damaged our international reputation”.Arrow said in directing the ARC to investigate Abdel-Fattah, Clare had created “a new form of arbitrary political interference in research” that was “seemingly triggered by an opposition and media campaign against an academic, and directed at a project already funded and in progress”.The general secretary of the National Tertiary Education Union, Damien Cahill, has written to the ARC chair, Peter Shergold, seeking assurances the process has not been influenced by “external forces”, including media corporations.“The independence of the ARC is paramount and neither politicians nor any other external parties should be directing its priorities,” he wrote. “Australia’s future will suffer if research grants become political footballs.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it

With the weekend expected to bring wind gusts of up to 80kmh, authorities said it would take “many days, if not weeks” to bring them under control.Overland Track remains closed as crews battle bushfires in Tasmanian wilderness areaRead moreJeremy Smith, Tasmania’s commissioner for fire and emergency services, said containing the blazes would be a “long hard slog” requiring crews to go “metre-by-metre across the fire ground … These fires will take a long time to control, and ensure that they are extinguished”.The fires follow similar outbreaks in the state’s wilderness area over the past decade as lightning strikes combined with heat and wind to create hazardous conditions. In2018-2019fires burned 2.9% of the state, killing nearlytwo-thirds of its tallest known trees.Scientists say damage from fires caused by lightning strikeshas increased dramatically since the start of the millennium, and is expected to continue to worsen as summers became hotter and drier.About 90% of the land affected in the current fires was in national park or wilderness reserves, but firefighters managed to protect a treasured grove of Huon pine trees estimated to be thousands of years old. Brendon Clark, a liaison officer with Tasmanian Parks and Wildlife, said the stand of ancient trees, located in a natural refuge, was believed to be “still intact”.The Overland Track, the famous hiking trail which traverses the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair national park, suffered extensive damage. Authorities said the ongoing fires and repairs to infrastructure wouldprolong the track’s closure.Aerial observations confirmed aprivately owned huton the track had been destroyed. An 8m-long steel truss bridge and 860m of boardwalk were also badly damaged. The hut remained the only recorded loss of property by Friday afternoon.Tasmania mapClark said several Indigenous heritage sites in the Arthur-Pieman conservation area may have been affected and people should be prepared for the possibility they could be badly damaged.A thick plume of smoke that wasvisible from spaceenveloped communities near the fire, including Zeehan, Granville Harbour and Corinna.Ali Collier, who runs the Zeehan bush camp, said the town became “very, very dark and smoky” on Thursday afternoon.When authorities warned residents an unpredictable and fast-moving fire was headed towards Zeehan, Collier evacuated with her two children to nearby Strahan. Others from the town headed to nearby Queenstown. They began to return on Friday, but Collier said people remained “on edge”.She said the fires had arrived amid peak tourism season and cancellations were already hurting the community.While many locals left town, the Zeehan hardware store remained open. The owner, Don Edmonston, sold hoses to those preparing to stay behind.He said the town of about 700 people was unusually quiet on Friday, but people were starting to trickle back in as the immediate threat passed. Rain on Thursday night had cooled things down temporarily, he said, but residents remained alert to potential wind changes.Preparing for the long haul, authorities established a basecamp and temporary accommodation for 100 personnel in the tiny village of Tullah – population 202 – tucked between Lake Rosebery and Mount Farrell. Fatigued fire fighters welcomed the arrival of remote area specialists from interstate, including about 30 aircraft. Additional crews from interstate and New Zealand were expected on Monday.“These are extremely experienced fire fighters. What they’re doing is not like tanker-based fire-fighting operation,” Smith said. “It’s in wilderness areas, in areas where they are either flown into, or they have to walk into, and it’s very much manual, hard labour.”Explore more on these topicsTasmaniaAustralian climate and environment in focusBushfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, it’s the opposite | Larry ElliottRead moreIn a post to Truth Social, Trump said the US had one of the most open economies in the world, imposing fewer barriers to imports than its trading partners.“For many years, the United States has been treated unfairly by trading partners, both friend and foe. This lack of reciprocity is one source of our country’s large and persistent annual trade deficit in goods – closed markets abroad reduce United States exports and open markets at home result in significant imports.”Trump said his new plan would be “comprehensive” and would include reciprocal tariffs for “unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes imposed by our trading partners … including a value-added tax”.AMP’s chief economist, Shane Oliver, argued Australia’s 10% GST is “not protectionist in any way” but Australia could still be “caught up”.“We may get caught up in Trump’s reciprocal tariffs if he deems our GST protectionist. It’s not, because the 10% rate applies to imports and local goods and services alike but it sounds like Trump may not see it that way.”Oliver said there was positive news in the White House saying it would first impose reciprocal tariffs on countries with which it has the highest trade deficits, meaning Australia – with a trade surplus – would be at the back of the queue.ING bank’s senior economist, Inga Fechner, said that while the Trump team were scrutinising the VAT system and viewing it as a tariff, it was unlikely countries could alter or abolish VAT systems in response.“Countries could, in principle, lower their tariffs to US levels. However, abolishing the VAT system is extremely unlikely. In the EU, VAT revenues account for 7.5% of GDP and 18.6% of total tax revenues,” Fechner said.In Australia, states and territories receive GST revenue, which makes up about 23% of their income.“Globally, 175 countries have a VAT system, with the US being one of the few exceptions, using a sales tax system by state varying from 0% to 11.5%, instead. Since VAT is typically applied as a destination-based tax, meaning it is charged based on where the goods or services are consumed rather than where they are produced, it aligns with WTO principles,” Fechner said.Additional uncertainty remains over whether Australiawill be exemptedfrom the Trump administration’s new 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports.Trump signed an executive order imposing the tariffs on Monday, saying they would be implemented in March with “no exemptions, no exceptions”.Within hours, he then said he was giving “great consideration” to carving Australia out of the tariff regime, with Australian ministers and officials since making the case in Washington for reprieve.Australia was granted an exemption from similar tariffs during Trump’s first term in office, and a similar deal in this term could boost the domestic construction sector.A carve-out specific to Australia would lead other major economies, particularly in Asia, to send steel to Australia instead, lowering domestic prices, the Australia Steel Association’s chief executive, David Buchanan, told AAP.Sectors such as housing could benefit from lower costs and greater imports.“We may see some improvements of the price of steel coming this way, and that’s good for construction and manufacturing in Australia, which we know is under pressure,” Buchanan said.“If Japan, Korea and Vietnam have issues exporting to the US, they may focus back towards Australia and we may see increased attention from those countries.”In turn, cheaper steel could make a difference in the construction of apartments, the Housing Industry Association’s chief economist, Tim Reardon, said.“Steel is not a big issue in detached houses, but steel is a significant cost to apartment buildings,” he said.“Certainly lower steel prices have a tangible impact in reducing the cost of apartment construction … we’re producing half the number of apartments we were a decade ago.”Anthony Albanese was spruiking the domestic steel industry during a visit to a steelworks in Illawarra this week, arguing the trade surplus between the US and Australia would strengthen Australia’s case to be exempted from Trump’s latest round of tariffs.“It is in Australia and the United States’ interests for us to have free and fair trade between our two countries,” the prime minister said.“Australian steel and aluminium has contributed to the United States economy, contributed constructively, and our economic relationship is very important.”Australian steel powers American jobs.@BlueScopeemploys nearly 5000 Americans across 16 states.

Every person in Canberra, from senior cabinet ministers to junior staffers, has a different theory.MPs are acting as if they’re about to hit the election trail, with some giving farewell speeches. “See you in a few months if I don’t lose my seat”, one MP told me on Thursday night.Election speculation is our least favourite game in federal politics (bring on fixed terms) but the spectre of the as-yet unconfirmed date loomed large over all that happened the past fortnight in parliament.Some political theatre from the prime minister only fuelled the anticipation.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe electoral reform bill wasrammed through with little debate(if parliament is coming back for the next scheduled sitting week in March, why the sudden rush?). Did Anthony Albanese host some lower house crossbench MPs at the Lodge this week to curry favour with independents who could become kingmakers in a hung parliament?Why did Labor MPs erupt in an explosion of laughter when veteran backbencher and scallywag Graham Perrett was booted from question time on Thursday, other than it was potentially his last in a long list of 94a ejections? And did Albanese himself cackle “on his last day”, or “on one of his last days”, when Perrett left the chamber with a grin on his face?Labor v the Coalition: who is leading in the polls?Read moreIf these sound akin to arcane efforts to read tea leaves or divination stones to predict tomorrow’s weather, that’s not far wrong. But the fact is, many MPs are not expecting to come back and are keener to spend every waking second pounding pavement and knocking on doors to whip up votes.Albanese himself was in good spirits by Thursday night, telling people he thought Labor had a strong fortnight, claiming the Coalition had struggled to sell their message. In a fortnight where Labor passed major agenda items on itsFuture Made in Australia plan, expanded childcare benefits and electoral reform, as well as tough laws on hate speech and antisemitism, Peter Dutton and the Coalition failed to land a major blow.Dutton didn’t even take a swing on Thursday; potentially the last sitting day, potentially his last day in the opposition leader’s chair. And he didn’t even ask a question in question time. Labor constantly cackled about their side’s latest zinger on the opposition’s policy for tax-deductible lunches.Earlier in the week, Dutton had tried to set an impossible bar for Albanese: arguing that securing world-leading exclusive exemptions from US tariffs for Australian steel and aluminium was the absolute minimum.Smart money in Canberra has long been on 12 April, or 17 MayDutton claimed because the former Coalition government in 2018 had secured such exemptions, Albanese must also.Also not in Dutton’s claims was the fact thata so-called “voluntary undertaking” from the Morrison government in 2019to limit aluminium exports was at the heart of the “verbal commitment” – which the Trump’s administration accuses Australia of breaking. The deal, struck over a dinner in Osaka, was key to Australia keeping the original exemptions during Trump’s first presidency, so it’s hard to criticise the former government much for this. But the Albanese government isnot-so-subtly pointing the fingerat the Coalition for agreeing to the deal which Trumpworld 2.0 says we’ve breached.The tariffs come into force in March, by which time we may be in the thick of an election campaign.The government will be sweating on achieving exemptions by then, even if high-level sources downplay any prospect of an imminent answer. Albanese on Friday zipped to Wollongong, telling workers “we’ve got your back, we support blue-collar jobs” at the region’s Port Kembla Bluescope steelworks.It doesn’t appear Trump has flagged “great consideration” of tariff exemptions for any country besides Australia, meaning we’re starting at something of an advantage. It’s important to remember these are worldwide tariffs, so it’s far from the alternate reality posed by some on the right that it would be a grave damning of Albanese or Labor if we failed to get the only exemption in the world.Which brings us neatly back to the election. When will it be?Smart money in Canberra has long been on 12 April, or 17 May, both avoiding school holidays and the WA election. The April possibility also would render no need for more parliament, and scrub a few weeks of budget estimates – always tricky periods for a government.Crossbench sidelined as Labor strikes deal with Coalition on political donations and spending capsRead moreOne whisper that barrelled through Parliament House this week, however, was a sudden realisation that 12 April is the start of Passover, a major Jewish holiday. In a highly charged social environment that Australia finds itself in, does the government want to run even the slimmest risk of an opponent making the case that holding an election on this date would be disrespectful to the Jewish community?Albanese, for his part, threaded another piece of red yarn on to thePepe Silvia conspiracy corkboardthat is the art of election speculation, raising the remote possibility of holding two elections.“We could have a half-Senate election on September 27, any time before then. If there is a Senate and House of Reps election, it has to be before May 17,” he said.Dragging it out for another seven months. The punters would love that.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttonanalysisShareReuse this content"

A lexicon of Europe’s far rightRead moreThe backing of Vance – orElon Musk, who recently gave a video address at an AfD party summit– is unlikely to tilt the result of Germany’s elections, said Berzina. And it’s unlikely to browbeat the ruling Christian Democratic Union, which should win next week’s vote, into allowing AfD to enter any coalition.But the US right under Trump does have its eyes set on a broader transformation in Europe: the rise of populist parties that share an anti-immigration and isolationist worldview and will join the US in its assault on globalism and liberal values. They see those leaders in Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Giorgia Meloni in Italy, as well as the UK’s Reform party and Marine Le Pen in France.“It is personal and it is political in terms of far-right political alignment,” she said. “It also opens the door to what other unprecedented things are we going to see in terms of the US hand in European politics.”Could the US president even threaten serious policy shifts like tariffs based on an unsatisfactory German coalition? “That would be normally unthinkable,” she said in response to that question. “But in 2025, very little is unthinkable.”Trump has claimed a broad mandate despite winning the popular vote by a smaller margin than any US leader since the early 2000s. And he seeks to remake politics at home and redefine the US relationship with its allies abroad, many of whom attacked him personally in the wake of the January 6 insurrection and his second presidential campaign.Vance also wanted to antagonise Europe’s leaders on Friday. He refused to meet with Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor who should be among the US’ key partners in negotiations with Russia over the future of the war in Ukraine. “We don’t need to see him, he won’t be chancellor long,” one former US official told Politico of the Vance team’s approach.That speaks to a trend in the Trump administration’s thinking: that voters abroad will handle what his negotiations and alliances cannot. As Vance stunned the European elite on Friday, he told them that “if you’re running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you”.“You need democratic mandates to accomplish anything of value in the coming years,” he said.This is something that Vladimir Putin, who waited years for the return of a Trump administration, knows well regarding his war in Ukraine: sometimes you have to bide your time until conditions are right.And it’s something that Trump intimated about Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he riffed on his plan to end the war through negotiations that would cede Ukrainian territory and give up Kyiv’s designs on Nato membership.“He’s going to have to do what he has to do,” Trump said of Zelenskyy agreeing to a deal. “But, you know, his poll numbers aren’t particularly great.”Explore more on these topicsJD VanceEuropeTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsGermanyThe far rightanalysisShareReuse this content"

Ukrainian officials had presented a revised draft of the deal that couldopen up resources of rare earth metalsin return for US support. Members of the delegation later told Reuters that “some details” still needed to be finalised.The Ukrainian president seemed satisfied that, with the support of European leaders, he had managed to force the Trump administration to adopt a more considered and collaborative approach, after he was left reeling this week by a series ofunilateral unconditional concessionsTrump appeared to be offering to the Russian president.JD Vance stuns Munich conference with blistering attack on Europe’s leadersRead moreZelenskyy also seemed to have slowed the rush to staging imminent talks with Putin. He said that when he met his Russian counterpart – whom he called a liar – nothing would be kept off the table.Both Zelenskyy and Vance said they had a “good” conversation and would meet again for talks in future. “Our first meeting, not last, I’m sure,” Zelenskyy said. Vance said more talks would be held “in the days, weeks and months to come” – a longer timetable that will reassure Zelenskyy, who feared he might be bounced into formal negotiations.Vance, who was flanked by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the special presidential envoy for Russia andUkraine, Keith Kellogg, refused to go into the details of any peace plan, saying: “I want to preserve the optionality here for the negotiators and our respective teams to bring this thing to a responsible close.”Earlier in the day, European leaders claimed to have won US assurances that Ukraine’s leadership would be fully consulted over any peace talks with Russia and that the sovereignty of Ukraine would be protected, as they sought to ease fears that Trump was on the brink of abandoning Kyiv.A strong show of European unity in support of Ukraine at the Munich conference, coupled with private assurances from key figures in the Trump administration that decisions were not imminent, went some way towards dampening intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration’s foreign policy.European leaders were furious this week when the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, ruled out Ukraine ever joining Nato and said the country would have to abandon most of its territory occupied by Russia. Shortly after Trump unexpectedly announced thathe had already spoken to Putinfor more than an hour and would begin peace talks, Hegseth also said no US troops would contribute to any European peacekeeping force in Ukraine in the event of an agreed ceasefire.Zelenskyy said in his speech to the conference – an annual gathering of international security policy decision-makers – which he made before the Vance meeting, that he believed the US president was the “key” to ending the conflict and that Trump had given him his phone number.The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Americans to realise that failure for Ukraine would not only weaken Europe, it would weaken the US too. Ukraine wanted a peace that was “just and lasting, so the horrors of the last years are not revisited again”, she said.She tried to reassure delegates that some voices in the often chaotic Trump administration still recognised that Ukraine’s long-term security was a crucial objective for the whole of the western alliance. Offering an olive branch, she told the conference: “We need to be honest here, and we need to avoid outrage and outcry. Because if we listen to the substance of the remarks, we not only understand where they are coming from but recognise there are some remarks we can agree on.”Although European leaders still talk about Ukraine joining Nato, Zelenskyy has long recognised that objections from the US and Russia make it a distant prospect.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, speaking after meeting Vance, said of prospective peace talks that “there was an agreement that Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians have to be part of that negotiated deal”. UK defence sources said there was little sign that Trump would be able to secure a quick deal with Putin since Russia believed battlefield gains would increase as Ukrainian morale crumbled in the face of the divisions in the western alliance.Zelenskyy tried to shore up his European support by warning that Russia could deploy as many as 150,000 troops next year to attack Europe. His key objective is to galvanise Europe so that it places tens of thousands of troops inside Ukraine as part of an enforceable ceasefire deal. He knows the deal will require him to cede land to Russia temporarily and will signal a long-term US pivot away from the defence of Europe.Zelenskyy added that he had no knowledge of Trump’s claim that Russian officials were travelling to Munich to join trilateral talks with him and the US.Von der Leyen also moved to allay US concerns about the level of European military spending by announcing she would suspend strict rules on public expenditure to allow governments to ramp up defence investments.Zelenskyy was bolstered by strong support from the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and an eight-nation Baltic-Nordic leaders’ statement. After a call with the Ukrainian leader, Starmer issued a statement that implicitly upbraided Hegseth and some of the freewheeling commentary by Trump, which was widely seen as unnecessary and leading to premature concessions before talks had started.Downing Street said the prime minister “was unequivocal that there could be no talks about Ukraine without Ukraine”. Ukraine needed strong security guarantees, further lethal aid and a sovereign future, and it could count on the UK to step up, a spokesperson said.The Baltic-Nordic group said: “We fully commit to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. Ukraine should be given strong security guarantees.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiaDonald TrumpUS foreign policyVolodymyr ZelenskyyJD VancenewsShareReuse this content"

Ukraine needed strong security guarantees, further lethal aid and a sovereign future, and it could count on the UK to step up.“The prime minister reiterated the UK’s commitment to Ukraine being on an irreversible path toNato, as agreed by allies at the Washington summit last year.”While Starmer’s sentiments are no more than a restatement of the UK’s longstanding position, one maintained by Labour and the Conservatives, the decision to speak to Zelenskyy and the strong language used has a fresh resonance after Donald Trump’s interventions this week.On Wednesday, the US presidentsuddenly announcedthat he and Vladimir Putin had spoken at length and agreed to begin negotiations over a ceasefire in Ukraine.Trump said it was unlikely Kyiv would win back all its territory, and that he was “OK” with Ukraine not having Nato membership, a major concession to Moscow made before any formal talks have begun. The US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, speaking at a Nato meeting in Brussels,also ruled out Ukraine’s membership of the allianceand the restoration of Crimea and other territories occupied by Moscow since 2014.graphicThe news prompteddismay in Ukraineandebullience in Moscowat the apparent end of Russia’s isolation on the world stage. However, European defence ministers, who have gathered in Brussels for a Nato meeting this week, havepushed backhard against concessions to Russia.Boris Johnson, the UK former prime minister, said on Friday that Trump would not “betray” Ukraine, and that he had a “very, very good point” aboutEuropeneeding to step up, claiming there was “quite a lot of headless chicken-ism from the Europeans” about what the US was saying.In an interview with GB News, he said: “I think people need to focus more carefully on what theTrump administrationis actually saying … what we should be doing is working with our European friends on the crucial part of the Trump proposals which is to fortify Ukraine. If we can’t get them immediately into Nato, what we need to do is strengthen them.”Speaking overnight, Emmanuel Macron said apeace deal would amount to “capitulation”, and that only Zelenskyy could negotiate on behalf of his country.Downing Street said Starmer and the Ukrainian president agreed in their call that the third anniversary of Russia’s invasion, in 10 days’ time, “would be an important moment to demonstrate international unity and support for Ukraine”.It continued: “The leaders also reflected onthe prime minister’s visit to Kyivlast month, and the president updated on his plans at Munich Security Conference. They agreed to stay in close contact.”Shortly before the phone call, the UK Foreign Office imposed sanctions targeting figures working in the Russian government, including Pavel Fradkov, a defence minister, and Vladimir Selin, who leads an arm of the country’s ministry of defence. The Foreign Office said in a statement it also imposed sanctions on Artem Chaika, whose extractives company supports Russian state-owned business, and two entities linked to Russia’s nuclear energy corporation Rosatom.Explore more on these topicsUkraineKeir StarmerVolodymyr ZelenskyyForeign policyTrump administrationRussiaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The pontiff has started “hospital drug therapy”, the statement added, and his “clinical condition is fair; he has a slight fever”.The pontiff’s planned attendance at an audience on Saturday has been cancelled, while mass in Saint Peter’s Basilica on Sunday will instead be delivered by Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça. A visit to the Cinecittà film studios on Monday has also been cancelled.Francis, 88, held several meetings on Friday before being taken to hospital, including with Mark Thompson, the CEO of the CNN news channel, which later reported that the pontiff was “mentally alert but struggling to speak for extended periods due to breathing difficulties”.Vatican installs webcam at St Peter’s tomb for next year’s Catholic jubileeRead moreThe pope, who has been blighted by ill-health in recent years, was also hospitalised in March 2023 with acute bronchitis. After being discharged, he said: “I am still alive.” He was readmitted to the Gemelli for health checks in June that year and again in February 2024 after suffering from what he said was “a bit of a cold”.Francis had part of his lung removed in his early 20s while training to be a priest in his native Argentina. In June 2021, he underwent a colon operation.He has often been seen in a wheelchair or with a walking stick due to a sciatic nerve pain and a knee problem. In January, he injured his right forearm after falling at his Casa Santa Marta residence and on 1 February he stumbled after his walking stick snapped while entering the Vatican’s auditorium. In early December, Francis hit his chin on his nightstand, reportedly after a fall.Francis, whose schedule has intensified because of this year’s catholic jubilee, has often alluded to resigning if bad health prevents him from doing his job. In 2023, he revealed he had chosen his burial place – the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in the Esquilino neighbourhood of Rome – breaking with the longstanding tradition of popes being buried in the grottos beneath St Peter’s Basilica.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanReligionItalyCatholicismChristianityThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

The newspaper said the tests, completed on Thursday, attributed the blood stains to Cardia’s genetic profile. The result is expected to be handed to prosecutors on 28 February.Cardia’s lawyer, Solange Marchignoli, suggested that the presence of Cardia’s DNA did not rule out a supernatural phenomena.“The DNA stain warrants further investigation,” Marchignoli told Corriere. “We are waiting to find out whether it’s a mixed or single profile.” She argued that while it was obvious there would be traces of Cardia’s DNA because she had “kissed and handled the statue”, it could have been mixed up with others, possibly even that of the Virgin Mary. “Who can say? Do you know the Madonna’s DNA?”Cardia, who has a previous conviction for bankruptcy fraud, bought the statue in 2016 at a Catholic pilgrimage site in Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It later became the centrepiece of the pilgrimage site she created in Trevignano Romano, with people from acrossItalyflocking to the town for monthly worship, much to the irritation of local residents.Cardia reportedly left Trevignano, but it is unclear where she is now. Marchignoli said: “I don’t know where she’s currently praying, but I know for a fact that she is moved by a deep faith and has nothing to gain from this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were allabducted from the Nir Oz kibbutz, near Gaza, in the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023. Two were held by Hamas and one by Palestinian Islamic Jihad.The identities of the Palestinians due to be freed have not been published, but they are expected to include 333 people taken prisoner inGazasince the start of the war and 36 inmates serving life prison sentences.Israel and global human rights groups expressed outrage at thefrail, emaciated state of the three hostages freed a week ago, their accounts of brutality in captivity, and the handover event staged by Hamas in which the three men had to thank their captors in front of a line of masked, armed gunmen.1:04Hamas releases three more Israeli hostages as part of ceasefire deal – videoAn Israeli-American hostage released two weeks ago, Keith Siegel, has given a chilling account of his experiences. “I was held for 484 days in unimaginable conditions, every single day felt like it could be my last,” he said in a video message. “I was starved and I was tortured, both physically and emotionally.”The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which has facilitated the exchanges, said in a statement: “The latest release operations reinforce the urgent need for ICRC access to those held hostage. We remain very concerned about the conditions of the hostages.” It called onHamasto ensure future handovers were conducted in privacy and with dignity.‘Who is Trump to decide our fate?’: takeover threat adds to uncertainty in GazaRead moreIf Saturday’s hostage release goes ahead, it will bring to 19 the number of Israelis exchanged for about 1,100 Palestinians.Five Thai citizens have also been released. By the end of the first six-week phase, another 14 hostages (six live and the remains of eight who have died in captivity) are due to be freed in exchange for another 800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.A second phase is due to begin on 1 March, in which both sides plan to release all remaining hostages and prisoners, and Israel would complete its military withdrawal from Gaza. But so far,Benjamin Netanyahuhas not empowered his negotiators to start talks on how this second phase would proceed, and Israeli analysts question the prime minister’s readiness to stick to the agreement.“It’s no secret that Netanyahu doesn’t want the deal to continue and wants to stop it before the second phase,” Haaretz’s military analyst,Amos Harel, wrote, adding that if the truce ended, there could be “a year or even longer” of fighting to come.The truce agreement appeared in danger of collapse this week after Hamas announced there would be an indefinite delay to the release of the next three hostages owing to Israel’s alleged violations of the deal. Soon after, Trump suggested that Israel should demand that the remaining hostages be freed by noon on Saturday or “all hell is going to break out”.0:48Trump warns 'all hell is going to break out' if Gaza hostage deadline not met by Hamas – videoIsrael massed troops around the edge of the Gaza Strip, deepening fears the ceasefire would come to an abrupt end. On Thursday, however, theimmediate crisis appeared to recedewith Hamas confirming three Israelis would be freed and Netanyahu’s office clarifying that it was not demanding the liberation of all the remaining hostages.However, Trump’s shocking proposal the US would claim possession of Gaza, which would be emptied of its 2.2 million Palestinian inhabitants and developed into a “Riviera” resort coastline, hasclouded the prospectsfor the ceasefire’s survival over the coming weeks.Egypt and Jordan have made it clear to Trump’s administration that they are not prepared to host hundreds of thousands of Palestinians ethnically cleansed from Gaza.The two Arab states, joined by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are expected to take part in the Saudi-hosted summit on 20 February, according to sources quoted by Agence France-Presse. The meeting is reportedly intended to hammer out a development plan for Gaza to present as an alternative option to Trump’s proposal.Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesHamasBenjamin NetanyahuDonald TrumpSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

After nearly 500 days in captivity, all three appeared to struggle to see in the daylight, and were so weak that armed fighters had to help them walk.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Ohad Ben Ami, Eli Sharabi and Or Levy are flanked by Hamas fighters on a stage before being handed over to the Red Cross.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/Reuters“It was important for me to understand everything you’ve done and continue to do … I genuinely feel that you all played a part in giving me my life back,” Levy told the Tel Aviv crowd on Friday.“I may be here, but I still have many brothers and sisters in the hell ofGaza, and their time is running out.”The three men appeared more frail than the 13 Israelis and fiveThai citizenspreviously released in the Gaza war’s ceasefire, sparking fears that if Hamas is freeing the healthiest captives first, the next to return will be in even worse shape. For much of the Israeli public, there is a renewed sense of urgency that the remaining hostages must be brought home as quickly as possible.Niva Wenkert, whose 23-year-old son Omer is supposed to be freed during the first 42-day phase of the truce, told Reuters on Friday that seeing the state of the three men released last week was like a punch in the gut. “I’m afraid that Omer’s life is in danger, every minute, every second,” she said.1:09Israeli hostages reunited with families after release – videoThe details emerging of how the Israelis freed in the first four weeks of the ceasefire were treated have added to the anxiety felt by the hostages’ families and supporters.Some former hostages who spent months in Hamas’s underground tunnels said they were fed only three dates or half a pita bread a day and shared half a litre of water among several people. Accounts shared by family members in the Israeli media suggest many were regularly beaten, abused, starved and shackled in chains which meant they were unable to stand up for long periods of time.View image in fullscreenA rally in Tel Aviv this week demanding the immediate return of hostages.Photograph: Nir Elias/ReutersRan Gilboa, the father of the freed soldier Daniella Gilboa, 20, told the Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth this week: “At the height of the war, there was no water, and Daniella and her friends were forced to drink filthy groundwater, causing her to contract a severe bacterial stomach infection, and she spent two weeks hovering between life and death. There were days when they had no choice but to eat donkey feed.”The hostages’ stories have increased public pressure on Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, to ensure the fragile deal does not collapse, despite calls to resume the fighting from far-right members of the coalition that have threatened to collapse his government.It is widely believed at home and abroad that Netanyahu, afraid that losing office will leave him more vulnerable to corruption charges, has to date prioritised the survival of his government over a hostage deal.The latest weekly poll from the Ma’ariv newspaper showed Netanyahu’s Likud party losing seats – a shift commentators attributed to Ben Ami, Levy and Sharabi’s physical condition upon release. However, public opinion is not a determining factor for the success of the ceasefire, according to Mairav Zonszein, a senior Israel analyst at the International Crisis Group thinktank.“The way the hostages looked accelerates the public pressure to get them out faster, but that was always there. It looks bad for Netanyahu if they come out in a poor state, but getting them out is still the best thing he can do in terms of what the public thinks,” she said.“Netanyahu wants to get back to war, because he and his partners have promised their base total victory over Hamas and a military solution, but he doesn’t want to be seen undermining the deal either. The momentum of the releases is hard to stop unless there’s a real and clear violation by Hamas.”At the start of the week the truce looked like it was in danger of collapsing after Hamas said it wouldsuspend this weekend’s scheduled release of three more hostagesunless alleged Israeli violations, including the continued killing of Palestinians in Gaza, were addressed. In response, Israelthreatened to resume the war, and Donald Trump inflamed the crisis bydemanding the group release all of the remaining hostagesthis weekend.By Friday, mediators appeared to have salvaged the deal, and Hamas’s smaller ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad said it would release three men as planned. Another eight living hostages are due to be released during the first 42-day stage of the ceasefire, and the remaining 68 are supposed to return in phase two.The deal’s future is still uncertain, Zonszein said, because the Israeli government does not want to commit to its second stage, which is due to begin in early March.“I think Bibi and Trump are going to keep trying to reshape the terms; it’s not clear yet what it is going to look like,” she said, using Netanyahu’s well-known moniker. “Ultimately, the hostages are Bibi’s secondary priority.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warHamasBenjamin NetanyahuGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Since the 7 October attacks in 2023, at least 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza (many of whom are women and children) have died.But any hypothetical takeover of war-torn Gaza – still teeming with thousands of Hamas fighters – undoubtedly requires American troops to be deployed to the Middle East on a mission of occupation for the first time since the failed Iraq war. Of course, the Islamic State (IS), originally an offshoot of al-Qaida in Iraq, was spawned out of that conflict.Bomb-plot trial of neo-Nazi leader pulls back veil on US extremist networksRead moreAlready, some of its propagandists and supporters are vowing to fight Trump’s plans for Gaza.“Islamic State knew that the [Americans] will takeover Gaza and displace the Palestinian [Muslims] to Sinai and other nearby countries and now we have Trump [infidel] who is talking about taking Gaza and displacing its population,” said one IS propagandist on an internal RocketChat, the group’s choice encrypted messaging service that it uses for recruitment.Trump is demanding that Egypt and Jordan, along with the other Arab League countries, take in Palestinian refugees he intends to displace during his rebuilding of Gaza.Another IS propaganda image spreading online through its media wing shows a picture of Trump pointing to Gaza on a map with the message: “The [infidels] will never succeed.”“It is a Jewish project under American sponsorship that aims to fire the last bullet of mercy on the so-called ‘issue’ of the Arab-Palestinian conflict and the Israeli conflict,” wrote another unknown IS operative about Trump’s plans, in one of its recent monthly magazines to followers.Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism and a research fellow at the Soufan Center, pointed out that “Islamic State supporters have taken to social media and messaging applications to capitalize on these comments and frame them as confirming the organization’s already-developing narratives about US support for Israel and its policies”.Webber says it’s a continuation of a highly successful campaign after 7 October to “tap into sentiments stirred up by the Israeli military response to Hamas’s attack to gain support, recruit, fundraise and incite violence”.He also noted that IS has newly active cells all over the world and has made concerted efforts to inspire followers in the US, such as the recent mass casualty event in New Orleans over the holidays.“The recent statement provides fodder for [IS] to continue leveraging this potent issue,” said Webber.On the other side of the spectrum, white nationalists of almost every ilk have gone against the Trump administration’s designs on Gaza. For accelerationist neo-Nazis, the kinds that preach coordinated bombings and other attacks to bring down the US government, they are undoubtedly inspired by their antisemitic hatred for Israel.“TRUMP TO SEND WHITES TO DIE FOR JEWS IN OCCUPATION OF GAZA,” said one prominent neo-Nazi account on Telegram in a post with over 2,000 views. “At present, our race is under the direction of hostile foreign tribes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Over generations, the Educational Bookstore has become a respected institution, selling academic, historical and political works and fiction alongside espresso coffee and teas to students, tourists, journalists and foreign diplomats. There were street protests after the raid and at least nine diplomats from the UK and other European countries attended the Munas’ court hearing.Some analysts suggested the targeting of the bookshop was a measure of the increasing radicalisation of the country’s coalition government,which includes far-right parties.Israeli journalist Noa Simonecalled the raid a “fascist act”, adding that it “evokes frightening historical associations with which every Jew is very familiar”.The Munas pointed to elements of dark comedy amidst the turmoil. The police raiding squad had not brought any Arabic speakers, so they resorted to Google Translate on their phones to try to find evidence of incitement in the books they were confiscating.1:47CCTV shows Israeli police raiding Jerusalem bookshop – video report“That was not very successful because sometimes the covers are written in such a font or in handwriting that is untranslatable,” Ahmed said. “So then the judgment became about the cover, the design – what colours it had, if it had a flag, if it had a picture of a prisoner.”After a couple of hours in both branches of the shop, the police took away about 300 books for further examination, including a children’s colouring book, a guide to climbing in thePalestinian territories, and a book profiling Hamas by a German author.“It was in German, but the policeman was using Google Translate set on English, so he couldn’t understand the blurb on the book,” said Mahmoud Muna, 41, who was managing the English and foreign language branch on Sunday. “If he had been able to read it, he would have seen it actually is quite objective. It is critical of Hamas for their use of violence as well.”The Munas spoke out about the experience in interviews in their separate apartments, which are on different floors of the same East Jerusalem building. The terms of their house arrest mean they cannot be in the same place or talk to one another.After the raid on Sunday afternoon, Ahmed and Mahmoud were taken to a police station just inside Jerusalem’s walled old city, where the confiscated books were laid out on a table for inspection.Mahmoud said: “Someone smart came in in a proper uniform, and he looked at all of them and I overheard him say: these books are all inconvenient for our ears but they are not exactly illegal.”“That gave me a little bit of relief,” he said. However, they were not released. The Munas were subjected to perfunctory 15-minute interrogations about their lives which they said did not touch on the contents of their books or politics in general. There was no more talk of incitement, which would have required authorisation from state prosecutors under the direction of the attorney general, and the charge was changed to causing public disorder, a catch-all accusation that does not need such authorisation to justify detention.There was space in a notorious overcrowded prison in the Russian Compound district for just one more prisoner on Sunday night. So Ahmed was kept in a holding cell in the police station, while his uncle was locked up in the Russian Compound prison.“It’s a place that’s simply unfit for a human to live in,” he said. There were ten detainees sharing his 25 sq metre cell, sleeping on mats on the concrete floor in near-freezing night temperatures.“It’s all very crowded with no heating, no electricity, no lights, no electric light or sunlight and no clock,” he said. The inmates have no idea of time, he said, and were woken by guards every two hours or so and made to stand to be counted.When he was moved around the jail, he said he was cuffed, blindfolded and dragged through the corridors.“When they drag you they cut the corners, and I believe intentionally make you hit the side of the doors or the side of a corner,” he said. “There’s a huge risk of actually always bumping your head.”View image in fullscreenMahmoud Muna, still under house arrest, is not allowed to see or talk to his nephew.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAfter 48 hours in detention, the Munas were released, though ordered to remain confined to their homes for a further five days. For another five days after that they are allowed to move around, but forbidden from talking to each other, though they can converse with anyone else, including the press. No explanation was given for the regulations.The police have handed back almost all the confiscated books, except eight. One of those is the children’s colouring book. That is titled From the River to the Sea, a controversial phrase used by both Palestinians and Israelis to imply territorial claims. But the Munas pointed out that the book had simply been sent for review and was in a back room. It was not for sale.For all the apparent arbitrariness of the raid, Mahmoud argued it was part of a deliberate and worsening pattern of constraints on Palestinian culture and free speech.“We should not look at this as an isolated event,” he said. “There have been a series of attacks on cultural institutions in Jerusalem and beyond. I think there is an awareness in the Israeli establishment that cultural institutions are playing a role in galvanising and protecting Palestinian cultural identity.”“The question is how far are they going to go?” he added. “If they’re attacking Palestinian bookstores now, they will be attacking Israeli bookstores next.”The Munas say they emerged from the experience convinced their fate would have been far worse if they did not have foreign supporters.“If we were not working in a bookstore with an international outreach with good international connections, what would have happened?,” Mahmoud said. “Probably the case would have been manipulated against us.”“It showed how easily your freedoms can be taken away from you – the rights you think you have but you actually don’t have,” Ahmed said. “You can be in your shop and within 30 minutes you don’t have your phone, you don’t have your rights, you’re completely disconnected from the world ... I started to think about the people who spent 10 years in these conditions, or 15 years – what kind of damage does that do to your mind?”This article was amended on 14 February 2025. An earlier version implied that a judge’s authorisation is needed for a charge of incitement. Rather, this authorisation must come from Israeli state prosecutors.Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I didn’t expect it to get so big seeing as the fire brigade got there quite early,” he said. “The whole street was shut off and you could see the smoke from quite far away … it was crazy.”He added that he was “in complete shock” about seeing the thick smoke and flames: “My coat stinks of smoke right now … I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that in the UK or in London.”Crews of firefighters from across London were deployed to the scene, including from Euston, Kensington and Chelsea, Paddington, Soho and West Hampstead fire stations.By 5.30pm, about two hours after the fire started, thick black smoke was billowing from the roof and firefighters began using an aerial platform to pump water on to the area.Videos on social media showed flames at the top of the building being doused by fire officers on a crane, while smoke comes out of the roof.LFB firefighters said a cordon was likely to be in place overnight, preventing access to the streets surrounding the five-star hotel.Shortly after it opened in 2014, the restaurant was reported to be “single-handedly feeding the celebrity sections of the tabloids”, a place where paparazzi “loll and glower, ready to pounce on the luminaries who swarm [there] like candle-crazed moths”.It was given 5/10 for value for money and 7/10 for food byrestaurant reviewer Marina O’Loughlin, and described as a place that “seems to be almost permanently accessorised by Kate Moss”.Bill Clinton, Bono, David Cameron, Keira Knightley and Lindsay Lohan have been photographed at the venue in the past. Madonna and Naomi Campbell are also among its celebrated clientele.Balazs said: “It is with heartfelt gratitude and appreciation that we watched a remarkable 120 firefighters from [more than] 14 stations rapidly descend on what they told me was a hugely sentimental building for so many of them.“We know in fact one of those who rushed to the Chiltern Firehouse this evening had been stationed in the building when it was a fire station 30 years ago. I am truly grateful to all of them as I am sure that this is not the Valentine’s Day evening they had in mind.”Explore more on these topicsLondonHotelsHospitality industryFirefightersnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that Trump knew the meeting was taking place, and had an assistant place a call to a mobile phone in the room.The US embassy in the UKtweeted a photoof the moment, showing Starmer at the dinner table with Burnett and others, using a mobile phone. The embassy said: “During the dinner @POTUS called his Envoy, who passed the phone to the PM”.Speaking to reporters from the White House on Friday, Trump said: “He asked for a meeting and I agreed to the meeting, we’re going to have a friendly meeting, very good.“We have a lot of good things going on. But he asked to come and see me and I just accepted his asking.”Responding to further questions about a date, he added: “Very soon, I think he wants to come next week or the week after.”The call, which once again emphasised the often freewheeling approach to diplomacy embraced by Trump and his White House, is believed to have been brief and only took in Starmer’s hope to visit the US soon for a formal meeting with Trump.No 10 will nonetheless welcome it, as it hopes Starmer’s tentative if so far warm relationship with Trump, who haspraised the prime minister, could lead to the UK escaping further tariffs or other penalties from an often capricious US administration. The pair spoke more formally by phone last month.Trumpappointed Burnettto his slightly vague role in December. The TV producer has been responsible for a series of hit US shows, notably The Apprentice, which gave Trump renewed prominence and arguably paved the way for his political career. Burnett also created or produced shows such as Survivor, Shark Tank and The Voice.“Mr Burnett and the prime minister agreed on the unique and special nature of the UK-US relationship, the strength of our alliance and the warmth of the connection between the two countries,” the No 10 statement said.“Mr Burnett reflected on his personal connections to the UK, and his mother’s experience working part-time in Downing Street as a waitress over 30 years ago.“They emphasised the huge potential for even stronger collaboration on trade, tech and cultural matters between the US and the UK and looked forward to working together.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpKeir StarmerUS foreign policyForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

Including warning labels would help raise awareness and encourage people to think about how much they drink”, said Malcolm Clarke,CancerResearch UK’s senior prevention policy manager.The World Cancer Research Fund, which monitors evidence on what lifestyle and other factors increase the risk of the disease, urged governments worldwide to act.Kate Oldridge-Turner, the organisation’s head of policy and public affairs, said: “Despite the fact that our own evidence shows alcohol is a risk factor for at least seven cancers, it is currently exempt from any mandatory warning labels in most countries. This is of great concern given how few people are aware of the links between alcohol and cancer.“Clear, highly visible health warning labels increase consumers’ awareness of the risks associated with drinking, and should be standard in Europe and around the world.”Dr Vivek Murthy, who was the surgeon general in Joe Biden’s administration, made thesame suggestionlast month.Ireland will become the first country in the EU to compel alcohol producers to put health warnings on labels including a reference to cancer from May next year.Labels warning about alcohol and pregnancy are already in place in France and Lithuania, while in Germany labels stipulate how old drinkers need to be before they can legally imbibe.Dr Hans Kluge, the WHO’s regional director for Europe, said: “Clear and prominent health warning labels on alcohol, which include a specific cancer warning, are a cornerstone of the right to health because they empower individuals with vital information to make informed choices about the harm alcoholic products can cause.“Providing this information does not take anything away from consumers. On the contrary, it arms them with knowledge and knowledge is power”.Dr Gauden Galea, a WHO strategic adviser on non-communicable diseases, said such warnings should be highly visible on cans and bottles and not just carried on websites. Governments must “resist all the pressures that will inevitably come from commercial actors” seeking to block the rollout of such labels, he said.The Portman Group, which represents alcohol producers in the UK, said warning labels would be too harsh a response to problematic drinking and would unsettle people.A spokesperson said: “Whilst we do not dispute the link between alcohol and cancer, and that drinking at harmful levels is dangerous and increases risks, blanket cancer warning labels are not a proportionate policy measure and do not put the risks into an appropriate context. This can create unnecessary anxiety, eroding trust in health advice and alienating the very people who require support.”Dr Katherine Severi, the chief executive of the Institute ofAlcoholStudies thinktank, backed the WHO’s call. “In the UK we’ve got into a ludicrous situation where a bottle of orange juice or milk require more information on their label than a bottle of wine or vodka. Our inadequate regulations have for too long favoured alcohol companies over the health of the public.”She said Wes Streeting, the health secretary, should introduce “mandatory labelling requirements. People have a right to know what they are putting in their bodies.”The department of health and social care has no plans to introduce health labels on alcohol products.A spokesperson said: “This government is committed to shifting from sickness to prevention, which includes reversing the trends we’ve seen in alcohol related deaths. That’s why we are investing an additional £267m in drug and alcohol treatment this year, to ensure more people receive better quality support. On top of this, we have already begun developing a national cancer plan to help us fight cancer on all fronts, including through prevention.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholCancerHealthWorld Health OrganizationnewsShareReuse this content"

She described Mason as being “psychotic and possessive”, the inquest was told. He sent her more than 1,000 messages the previous month.Appearing in person, Mason, who is now working as a driving instructor, declined to answer questions about his interactions and relationship with Beck.Asked by the assistant coroner Nicholas Rheinberg if he had threatened suicide or self-harm to manipulate Beck into a close relationship, Mason said: “My aim was never … it was not to manipulate or stuff … I don’t know if I had an aim … I can’t remember.”Rheinberg had advised Mason that he did not have to answer questions if his answers were likely to incriminate him. Mason denied asking Beck to sleep with him while they were staying in a hotel in Swindon for an event in December 2021.The inquest was read a message that Beck sent to Mason that day which said: “I honestly feel trapped in this whole situation, I have tried to act as a normal as possible because we are working together but nothing is normal about this situation.“I have tried to be there for you as a friend but it completely crossed the line of that a long time ago. I have felt so uncomfortable at this event, I have literally cried about it and been up worrying about it.“The truth is I am struggling to deal with all this, it’s taken a huge toll on my mental health for many reasons. I need time out.”When asked whether he thought he hoped to get into a relationship with Beck, Mason told the inquest: “I knew there was never a chance with Jaysley.”Alison Gerry, legal counsel for Beck’s family, questioned Mason about WhatsApp messages that he sent to Beck before the coroner halted the line of questioning out of concern for the “mental health” of the witness.Finishing her questions, Gerry asked Mason: “You were Jaysley’s line manager, you were older, she was a young new soldier and your subordinate and it’s right you became completely obsessed with her, possessive, jealous, manipulative and when she split up with her boyfriend, you were overjoyed as that meant you could be together and, when that did not happen, you became more obsessive and manipulative?”He replied: “I decline to answer.”Mason, who left the army a few days before Beck was found dead, after 13 years with the forces, later broke down in tears as he told the hearing that he had suffered from mental health problems since he was a child and had self-harmed in 2015.The hearing continues.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor’s profile claimed she worked at the Bank from September 2000 to December 2006. However, she had in fact left by March 2006 when she began working forHBOSin West Yorkshire.Asked about the accuracy of her LinkedIn profile on a visit to Nottinghamshire, Reeves told broadcasters: “I worked as an economist at the Bank of England between 2000 and 2006 before going to work in financial services for Halifax Bank of Scotland.“And I’m really proud of the work that I did before I became an MP, but in the end, people are going to judge me on the job that I’m doing now as chancellor of the exchequer to grow the economy and put more money in the pockets of working people.”Ministers ‘mission-washing’ spending plans in effort to avoid cutsRead moreThe controversy was reignited after reports last year that Reeves had not accurately reflected her job title on her LinkedIn profile, which described her as an economist at HBOS from 2006 to 2009 when her role was in retail banking. Her LinkedIn profile was updated to reflect that, and sources said at the time that a staff member had been responsible for the description.On Thursday, the BBC reported a further discrepancy over dates, and that Reeves and two colleagues at HBOS had been investigated over their expenses in relation to staff gifts. It said an initial inquiry suggested they appeared to have broken the bank’s rules, but that it was unclear what happened next.In a statement, the former HBOS HR manager Jane Wayper, who left the bank in 2008 according to her LinkedIn page, said she did not “recognise” any of the claims.Wayper said: “I would have been made aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer. I would have been required to organise and oversee a disciplinary process. This did not happen.”David Sorensen, a lawyer who acted for the chancellor as she left HBOS, said she was not subject to “allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct” during her career at the bank. He was responsible for overseeing “a standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank’s restructure”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He claimed that the BBC’s reporting that Reeves was subject to an internal investigation into expenses while working at the retail bank was “totally inaccurate”.The broadcaster reported its discoveries on Thursday and said it had looked into the chancellor’s time working for HBOS between 2006 and 2009.Asked about the report when he appeared on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Kyle said: “Unfortunately, the reporting has been totally inaccurate, and we heard yesterday that the person who was actually head of HR at that bank at that time says it’s untrue, said that she never, ever received a file on Rachel Reeves.”The minister was told that HBOS did not say there was no investigation, but that one had not been completed before the HR manager or Reeves had left the bank.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesHBOSBBCLabourBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

Lester pleaded guilty to second-degree assault as part of a deal with prosecutors that averted the trial.The charge to which Lester admitted carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison. First-degree assault, meanwhile, carries a sentence of 15 to 30 years, depending on the circumstances.Yarl showed up on Lester’s doorstep in April 2023 after he mixed up the streets where he was supposed to pick up his twin siblings. Investigators allege that Lester then shot Yarl twice through the house’s front glass door with a .32-caliber revolver.The wounded Yarl sought help at multiple homes before someone opened the door and agreed to call police. Neighbors found him lying injured in the street with two gunshot wounds to the head and arm.Lester, a retired aircraft mechanic, maintained he was acting in self-defense as well as out of a reasonable fear for his safety, and he initiallyentered a pleaof not guilty. On Friday, his sentencing was set for 7 March.The shooting received widespread attention and furtherignited discussionsabout racism andgun violencein the US. Missouri is a “stand your ground” state where people are permitted to use deadly force if they have reasonable belief they are at risk of a violent attack.Although the bullet reportedly did not enter his brain, Yarl had to undergo neurological surgery after the injuries to his head that were inflicted by Lester.He has since spoken about thelingering effects, saying his “mind is just foggy” and that he “can’t concentrate” on the things that would have otherwise been easy for him.Yarl’s family filed a lawsuit against Lester seeking civil damages after the shooting. Lester reportedly settled the litigation out of court for $100,000.Explore more on these topicsMissouriUS crimeGun crimenewsShareReuse this content"

This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press’s commitment to misinformation.”Budowich went on to accuse the 175-year-old news wire agency – whose style guidance is used by thousands of journalists and writers globally – of “irresponsible and dishonest reporting”.JD Vance breaks taboo by meeting with leader of Germany’s far-right partyRead moreBudowich said he recognized that the Associated Press’s reporting was covered by the US constitution’s first amendment, which provides for the freedoms of speech and press. But he maintained that “does not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One”.He added that Associated Press journalists and photographers would retain their credentials to the White House complex.According tothe Hill, an Associated Press journalist was barred from attending an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office on Friday afternoon following the White House’s announcement.The outlet reports that a White House official told the Associated Press journalist, “No, sorry,” when the reporter tried to join the event.Friday’s announcement from the White House marks an escalation in the growing feud between theTrump administrationand the Associated Press over the organization’s refusal to abide by Trump’s preference for Gulf of America and change its style on that body of water to Gulf of America.On Tuesday, the Associated Press said another one of its journalists was refused entry into an executive order signing ceremony at the Oval Office – a movedescribedby the news agency’s executive editor, Julie Pace, as an attempt by the White House to “punish” the organization for its independent journalism.“Limiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP’s speech not only severely impedes the public’s access to independent news, it plainly violates the first amendment,” Pace said.After Tuesday’s episode, Pacesenta letter to the White House, calling the White House’s decision an “alarming precedent”.A separate statement from the New York Times said it stood by the Associated Press while “condemning repeated acts of retribution by this administration for editorial decisions it disagrees with”.“Any move to limit access or impede reporters doing their jobs is at odds with the press freedoms enshrined in the constitution,” said the statement, which wasreportedby chief CNN media analyst, Brian Stelter.According toa 23 January style memo, the Associated Press said that it would not be changing its style on the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America after Trump’s decision to change the body of water’s name – a move which holds authority only within the US’s federal government.“The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences,” the Associated Press said.Blocking the Associated Press’s access around Trump could substantially affect news consumption in certain markets.The Associated Press provides reporting to numerous publications across the US that do not have their own reporters covering the White House.Supporters of Trump could also use the White House’s decision to limit access for Associated Press journalists as evidence for bad-faith arguments that the organization is unpatriotic or untrustworthy.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsAssociated PressnewsShareReuse this content"

Here we examine what has changed and how far the rollback might go.Which sectors are dropping DEI?So far, the most prominent names to announce changes are from the US finance and tech sectors. This week, the bank Goldman Sachsscrapped a policythat stipulated it would only take on a company’s initial public offering if it had at least one board member from a diverse background.The consultancy firm Accenture said last weekend it wasending the global diversity and inclusion goalsit set in 2017, along with career development programmes for “people of specific demographic groups”. Earlier this month, Google said it was reviewing some diversity initiatives andscrapping a goalto hire more employees from historically underrepresented groups, and has sinceremoved referencesto events including Black History Month, LGBTQ+ Pride and Women’s History Month from its online and mobile calendars.Is this a new trend?View image in fullscreenWall Street banks last year became some of the first firms to publicly distance themselves from diversity initiatives, including Goldman Sachs.Photograph: Joan Cros/NurPhoto/Re/ShutterstockNo, rightwing campaigners have been pushing for some time for organisations to scrap the more inclusive policies that were created in response to the protests after the police killing ofGeorge Floydin 2020, claiming they result in “reverse discrimination”.Those efforts moved up a gear after aUS supreme court rulingin 2023 that banned affirmative action in university admissions decisions, prompting Conservative groups tolaunch a wave of legal action against companiesover their diversity programmes.Last year, Wall Street banks became some of the first companies to publicly distance themselves from diversity initiatives, including Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, opening up the diversity programmes previously aimed only at people from ethnic minorities.The change gathered pace after Trump’s election in November, with a swathe of firms dropping DEI in the run-up to the president’s inauguration on 20 January, includingWalmart,McDonald’s, Ford,AmazonandMeta, which alsooverhauled its content moderationto remove restrictions on topics such as gender and immigration.Has it reached the UK yet?So far the main impact of the changes in Britain have been on users of Silicon Valley-based tech and social media platforms. The policy changes have also prompted some splits within organisations that operate in both countries, as their US and UK arms follow different paths.This week, the consultancy and accounting firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government toremove pronouns from their emails, while also announcing the end of its DEI programme.However, the boss of Deloitte UK informed staff its British operations would remain “committed to [its] diversity goals”. A memo from Richard Houston said changing government priorities in the US would not change its “commitment to building an inclusive culture” at its UK arm.Employment lawyers have warned that if companies embrace the Trumpian trend they could open themselves up to legal risk in the UK. British companies have “always had a merit-based approach” for hiring employees, as affirmative action does not apply, said Lucy Lewis, a partner at the law firm Lewis Silkin.However, she warned that “it is a big unknown if the federal government will require contractors who they are working with to go further and row back on diversity and inclusion in other ways”, which could create problems when working with some US firms.UK employers will continue to be required by law to report on certain diversity metrics, such as the requirement to disclose the representation of women and ethnic minorities on the board and in the executive teams of listed companies.Companies which announce changes to diversity schemes may also find it harder to recruit younger staff, according to multiple surveys of workers belonging to Gen Z – born between 1997 and 2012 – which have highlighted theirdesire to work for organisations that align with their values.“They only want to join companies which they see pay attention to these issues,” said Pavita Cooper, UK chair of the 30% Club, which campaigns globally to boost the number of women in boardrooms and in the leadership of companies. “The war for the very best talent has not gone away, and this is what matters to them.”Who is fighting back?View image in fullscreenThe GMB unions ‘worried’ that ‘multinational companies will bring a rightwing, regressive, anti-worker approach to their UK operations’.Photograph: Andriy Popov/AlamyTrade unions oppose the shift but are concerned that international companies may follow US policies, even within their UK businesses. The GMB union said it was worried that “multinational companies will bring a rightwing, regressive, anti-worker approach to their UK operations”, said Eleanor Saunders, GMB’s equality and inclusion organiser.“Employer diversity initiatives often don’t push hard enough against the causes of workplace discrimination, bias and harassment,” Saunders said. “But they are essential for employers to meet their legal obligations and to go beyond the bare minimum to make work accessible, fair and rewarding for all.”The Prospect union, which represents professionals including engineers, scientists, and tech workers, is concerned that the rollback of schemes in large US-based tech companies could have a direct impact on British employees, despite the different legal framework.It has written to the chair of the UK parliament’s women and equalities committee to ask it to call in tech executives for questioning on the changes.The bosses of large companies including Barclays and Unilever have in recent daysreaffirmed their commitment to diversity programmes, with Barclays’ chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan saying the lender wanted “to provide equality of opportunity” and to “create that inclusive environment”.Meanwhile, the strategic communications adviser Kekst CNC believes many companies are reassessing, not scrapping, their diversity and inclusion policies.“What they’re working towards are policies that are better bound to commercial strategy, and so stronger and more durable,” said Meghan Sheehan, head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability at Kekst CNC.Explore more on these topicsUS newsInequalityUS politicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationGoogleAmazonexplainersShareReuse this content"

The names included Mary Poppins, Mary Fairy and Homo Pomo, it was alleged.The company called in Paul Livingston, an employment law specialist from Outer Temple Chambers, to conduct an internal investigation.During interviews conducted by the lawyer, other staff stated that D’Amario had routinely used homophobic nicknames and language.One said they had heard the term “homo pomo” used regularly, considered it homophobic at the time and “didn’t think it was meant affectionately”.On another occasion, two witnesses said, D’Amario criticised displays in the company’s shops, saying they looked “too gay”. This comment had “horrified” some staff, according to one witness.In interviews with Livingston, D’Amario denied all allegations of using homophobic language, saying: “No, in my position the question of gay is the last thing in my brain.”One witness defended D’Amario, saying that he had never felt him to be homophobic, that “too gay” was commonly used in the fashion industry to mean overly flamboyant and that the Italian had come to his own gay wedding.The employee suggested that the language barrier could be a factor in “misunderstandings”.Another said they did not think D’Amario was homophobic.View image in fullscreenVivienne Westwood’s granddaughter Cora Corré quit the company in November last year.Photograph: Ki Price/Getty ImagesUltimately, the independent investigator upheld five allegations against D’Amario and said that the chief executive’s own denials of the alleged behaviour were not “persuasive”.The lawyer also said that D’Amario had expressed a desire to take witnesses to court or speak to them and at one point asked who was paying for the investigation and what would happen if the company decided it did not want to pay for it.“I have some concern that this was an attempt by [D’Amario] to put pressure on me as an investigator,” he said.The report included witness testimony that the investigator did not offer an opinion about because it was not directly relevant to the claim by the employee.That testimony included further allegations about D’Amario’s behaviour towards his employees.D’Amario, said one witness, was “about as politically incorrect as you could ever get”.He would, the witness said, say things such as “all these gay men in the company … you can’t trust them” and “all these gay men, they have no responsibilities”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is also among the most profitable.Based in a studio in south-west London, Vivienne Westwood Ltd has more than 300 employees and reported pre-tax earnings of £44m on £133m of revenues in 2023, according to Companies House records.As the company’s boss since 1986, first as managing director and latterly as chief executive, D’Amario – a close confidant of Westwood’s – presided over this meteoric growth.That corporate success went hand in hand with a strong commitment to Westwood’s own values, including activism on the climate crisis and human rights, espoused on the company’s website.The label has also worn queer allyship on its sleeve, most recently via last year’s partnership with the non-binary singer Sam Smith.Smith walked the catwalk at Westwood’s show for Paris fashion week in March 2024, showing off its fall/winter collection, to rave reviews from LGBT media outlets.View image in fullscreenNon-binary singer Sam Smith walked the catwalk for Vivienne Westwood womenswear at its show in Paris fashion week.Photograph: Arnold Jerocki/Getty ImagesBut the independent investigation into D’Amario’s conduct raises questions about whether the company’s apparent support for the LGBT+ community translated into firm action when it came to its leadership.In his report, Livingston found that D’Amario’s behaviour in relation to two of the allegations constituted harassment under section 26 of the Equality Act 2010, as well as a breach of the company’s own internal equality policy.Executives were supposed to complete training on equality, diversity and inclusion, as well as unconscious bias for managers, the report found.Yet many of the company’s top executives – including D’Amario and Westwood herself – never completed the training because they were not “computer skilled”, the report found.Vivienne Westwood Ltd’s equality policy was an “excellent” one and would be a “useful starting point” for any future training, Livingstone added.“It is a matter for the company as to what action should be taken following this report,” he wrote.The company’s action stopped short of dismissing or demoting D’Amario.Instead, he appears to have earned a six-figure salary for the year when the report was written, according to company accounts, which state the company’s highest-paid director earned £493,697 for the year to the end of 2023.Vivienne Westwood Ltd did not respond to questions about what disciplinary measures had been taken against the chief executive.Explore more on these topicsVivienne WestwoodFashion industryCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

And that’s a problem in a part of the restaurant sector known for converting relatively inexpensive ingredients into fast, affordable comfort foods.Egg prices alone havenearly doubledsince December, according to the US Department of Agriculture, and many breakfast restaurants and diners are reeling. Waffle House, a chain with more than 2,000 locations, recentlyannounceda $0.50-per-egg surcharge due to inflation and the worst avian influenza outbreak in history, as tens of millions of birds have been culled to contain its spread.It’s not just eggs that have gone up in price. Coffee is at a 47-year high, driven byclimate disruptionsin Brazil and Vietnam, the world’s largest producers. Thecost of frozen orange juicehas nearly doubled since 2020, due to citrus disease and climate shocks. Flour, too, hasbecome more expensivein recent years, with prices spiking in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Slaughter’s team last increased prices in October 2023 due to inflation. “We’re trying to do everything we can to not raise our prices. No one wants to go into a breakfast place and have to pay $25,” he said.View image in fullscreenJohkiya Pierre prepares an omelette at the Breakfast Brothers in Arlington, Texas, on 12 February 2025.Photograph: Julio Cortez/APExperts and restaurateurs say breakfast spots – which often rely on markups made possible by cheap and versatile ingredients, high-volume sales and loyal customers – are particularly vulnerable to these price shocks. The industry’s conventional wisdom that it’s easier to turn a profit with breakfast food may be in jeopardy.Amy Smith, an economist with the consulting group Advanced Economics Solutions, said the median price increase for popular breakfast items like eggs, coffee, sausage, bacon and orange juice was 19% compared with last year and double 2020 costs.But restaurants risk alienating customers who are already feeling squeezed by inflation. “Companies that are selling these things don’t have a lot of room to increase prices because consumers are already on edge,” Smith said. “If they’re paying triple or quadruple for a dozen eggs every week and coffee is going up, it’s certainly going to impact the decision to go out for a fancy brunch.”Daniel Soloway, director of procurement for the Mecha Noodle Bar chain, said: “Whether you’re a high-end, top-tier bakery in an urban setting or a Starbucks, there are few places to hide for a breakfast sandwich and a cup of coffee in 2025.”Restaurants that serve dinner or have larger menus can increase the prices on side items or drinks without raising eyebrows. “At a breakfast place, if the cost of protein – sausage and bacon – is going up, eggs are going up and flour is affecting the cost of bread, there’s no room to improve things for yourself,” he said. “You’re exposed.”Many restaurants are adapting by adding new menu items whose raw ingredients cost less. “Everybody I’m talking to is trying to figure out something that can offset [costs] and give the consumer another option,” Soloway said. But that’s a tricky feat for businesses that have staked their reputations on specific dishes.“Most of what we’re famous for is our pancakes, French toast, waffles, biscuits, egg dishes, eggs Benedict,” said Neil Kleinberg, chef and co-owner of Clinton St Baking Co in New York City. On busy weekends, customers often wait two or three hours for a seat–and those specialties.“So it’s very hard to tell someone to order a side of fruit and avocado and toast.”Like Slaughter, Kleinberg and his team raised prices across the board about a year ago to keep up with inflation: the eggs Benedict that cost $16 a few years ago now cost $18. He anticipates another increase to keep up with current trends.View image in fullscreenWhen Stephen Slaughter’s vendors started charging $8 for a dozen eggs, all six of his restaurants felt the pinch.Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Alamy“We’re getting either price-gouged, or the prices are out of control or fluctuating so much that we don’t know how much to charge for an omelet or an eggs Benedict,” Kleinberg said. He has gone from paying about $100 for a case of 360 eggs to nearly $300.Sam Yoo, the owner of Golden Diner in New York’s Chinatown, has grown accustomed to price fluctuations since he opened his restaurant in 2019. “Every year, we have to talk to our purveyors and [ask]: ‘Why did eggs go up so much this year?’” he said. “It happens all the time.”He acknowledged that the current increases were more significant, but said he was trying to ride them out. “It is going to affect us and our bottom line, but we opened the diner in our community. We still want to make our dining experience as accessible as possible,” he said. “So we’re trying not to knee-jerk react.”He’s relying on that community to weather this latest challenge. Yoo said that restaurants that serve dinner can boost their profits with appetizer and alcohol sales, whereas breakfast shifts make money because they serve a lot of people fast and attract repeat customers.Yoo said that other factors – including the introduction of congestion pricing in Manhattan last month, which he said has inhibited customers from coming in from the outer boroughs – have had a bigger impact on his business’s bottom line than egg prices so far. But like other restaurants, he has adjusted prices to keep up with inflation, about three times over the last six years.“Each time it’s by, like, a dollar here or there. It’s not such a massive change, especially for our regulars, who come in often and know what they want,” he said. For the breakfast restaurant, the flip side of that, however, is that some faithful patrons balk at changes to long-time menu items and prices.Kleinberg, who opened Clinton St Baking Co in 2001, said many New York restaurants had been struggling well before egg prices spiked and even before the pandemic.“Everyone tells me it’s harder and harder to make money in the restaurant business,” he said. Some businesses cut hours or use lower-quality ingredients to deal with higher overhead, such as labor and rent. “The fear is that you’re just not going to be able to make ends meet, no matter how popular you are.”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsOur unequal earthFoodSmall businessEggsBird fluClimate crisisBreakfastfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These include “models of vehicles”, “computer programmes and electronic comic books”, “electronic publishing” and design, encompassing uses such as restaurants, cocktail lounge services and accommodation.The claims were made by Kleindienst, founder of the Kleindienst Group which claims to be the largest European property developer in the United Arab Emirates.A spokesperson for Kleindienst confirmed that the businessman has plans to utilise the Bond name if he wins his challenge, and that an “announcement is coming soon”.The EU cancellation actions were filed on 27 January. While no date is provided for the timing of the filing of the UK actions, they are also likely to have been made recently as the cases are listed as “awaiting defence”.The James Bond trademarks are officially registered to US-based company Danjaq, which controls the rights to worldwide traditional James Bond merchandising in conjunction with Eon.Eon, the UK-based production company responsible for turning Ian Fleming’s James Bond into one of the most successful film franchises in history, is run by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who are fiercely protective of the intellectual property rights associated with 007.Danjaq also co-owns the copyright to the existing James Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which wasacquired by Amazon for $8.5bn in 2021– the same year the last outing of the franchise, No Time to Die, hit cinemas.“Following the date of the filing of the cancellations Danjaq has two months to submit their defence,” says Caddle. “If Danjaq want to keep these alive they will need to engage in a trademark office action to show that they have used James Bond in the areas being challenged in the last five years.”James Bond is also likely to be trademarked in the United Arab Emirates, where Kleindienst operates his property business and where the filings list his residence as a hotel, but the trademark office there is not readily publicly accessible to be able to ascertain whether similar cancellation claims have been made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In any case, Danjaq would certainly counter-challenge. James Bond is still well used and loved. I don’t think that route would be straightforward for him [even if he were to win].”Eon and Danjaq were contacted for comment.‘Bond’s audience will be patient’: Amazon MGM Studios’ boss on the hunt for a new 007Read moreMeanwhile, the ongoing saga ofwho will replace Daniel Craigas the next James Bond and when the next film will be announced rumbles on. More than three years on from his final appearance as 007, fans are no closer to knowing who his replacement will be.Articles have suggestedthat Broccoli, who along with Wilson maintains strict control over the film franchise and who plays Bond, did not hit it off with Amazon executives after the deal to buy MGM.In an interview with the Guardian last year, Jennifer Salke, the global head of Amazon MGM Studios, played down reports she got on the wrong side of Broccoli for raising the idea of a Bond TV series.“We have a good and close relationship with Eon and Barbara and Michael,” said Salke. “We are not looking to disrupt the way those wonderful films are made. For us, we are taking their lead. The global audience will be patient. We don’t want too much time between films, but we are not concerned at this point.”Explore more on these topicsJames BondIntellectual propertyDubaiEuropean UnionFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Moving from designing chips to making its own complete processor could also put Arm into competition with some of its biggest customers in the £500bn semiconductor industry.Arm declined to comment. Shares in the company rose by more than 6% on Thursday after the Financial Times reported on the plans.The Financial Times also reported that the launch of Arm’s own chip is one step in a larger plan by SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son to make more money from its own intellectual property by moving into AI chip production and building a vast infrastructure network for artificial intelligence.View image in fullscreenSoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son.Photograph: Koichi Mitsui/AFLO/Rex/ShutterstockLast month, Son unveiled his Stargate initiative with OpenAI, which will spend an estimated £400bn building AI infrastructure, with Abu Dhabi state fund MGX and Oracle also providing funding, and Arm as a key technology partner alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.Arm’s chip is expected to be a central processing unit (CPU) for servers in large datacentres and customisable for clients including Meta, according to those familiar with the plans. Production will be outsourced to a manufacturer such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, these people said.Another deal integral to Arm’s chipmaking project is Softbank’s expected acquisition of Ampere, an Oracle-backed chip designer of Arm-based chips for servers thatcould be valued at close to $6.5bn(£5.15bn).Cambridge-headquartered Arm has more than doubled in value to $173bn since it listed on the Nasdaq in 2023, buoyed by investor interest in AI. Arm had previously been listed in London, before Softbank took it over in 2016.Meta is the latest big tech company to turn to Arm for its power-efficient server chips instead of Intel and AMD, while Arm’s partnerships with Nvidia and Amazon have driven its rapid growth in the datacentres that power AI assistants from OpenAI, Meta and Anthropic.Explore more on these topicsArmTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

A week after he sent them tumblingout of the FA Cup, a breathtaking piece of control from the Japan winger to score the opening goal set up another memorable victory for Brighton and piled more pressure on the Chelsea manager.It meant a third defeat in their last four matches as Cole Palmer endured another frustrating night labouring as a false 9 before having to be cajoled to greet those travelling supporters who remained at the end. At times Maresca seemed lost on the touchline as he watched his side struggle to respond after Yankuba Minteh had made it 2-0 before half-time.Minteh’s second of the night killed off any hopes of a comeback and it could have turned into a Valentine’s Day massacre had Mitoma, João Pedro or Joël Veltman taken late chances. But having suffered his biggest defeat since taking over in the summer and with Fabian Hürzeler’s side moving to within six points of his expensively assembled squad, theChelseamanager will be wondering where the next win is coming from.Brighton 3-0 Chelsea: Premier League – live reactionRead more“We need to show more desire,” said Maresca, whose side did not even register a shot on target. “We feel upset and we feel very sorry for the fans. In this moment you cannot offer this kind of performance with 14 games to go. The fans have a right to be upset and the bad feeling is that we are conceding too many chances and not creating enough. This is a moment when we need to stick together.”Maresca brushed off criticism from some supporters this week after saying that their exit from the FA Cup meant they could concentrate on thePremier League, insisting that qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since 2022 would take the club back to where they “belong”. On this evidence, they will be fortunate to be back in the Conference League next season. “Probably since I arrived, that is [our] worst performance,” the Chelsea manager told Sky Sports.The decision to recall Filip Jörgensen in place of Robert Sánchez in goal meant the home fans had one fewer former player to boo. But they picked up where they left off last week whenever Moisés Caicedo or Marc Cucurella touched the ball.View image in fullscreenKaoru Mitoma fires in the opening goal from the edge of the area after an incredible first touch to control a long ball from his goalkeeper.Photograph: Sean Ryan/IPS/ShutterstockHürzeler called on his players to improve their wretched recent home form that had seen them fail to win any of their last five league matches at the Amex Stadium if they are to stand any chance of qualifying for Europe next season and once again got the response he required. “We knew that we had to be compact against Chelsea but in both games the intensity was the key,” the Brighton manager said.After blazing over when he had an early sight of goal, Palmer’s next effort was even worse as it skewed way off target following a surging run down the right flank that proved to be the end of Noni Madueke’s evening. He limped off with a hamstring injury and was replaced by Jadon Sancho.Brighton, in their first league game sincea 7-0 humbling by Nottingham Forest, had shown only glimpses of their threat up until that point and their breakthrough came from the most direct means possible. Bart Verbruggen – whose disastrous own goal last week gifted Chelsea the lead – picked out Mitoma with a raking pass and the Japan winger’s first touch as the ball dropped over his head was immaculate before he drifted past Trevoh Chalobah and curled the ball past Jörgensen with aplomb. “When I saw his first touch … I’ve seen him do it countless times in training,” said Danny Welbeck. “It was a thing of beauty.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead it was the home fans who could not contain their joy when a haphazard Chelsea defence failed to stop Georginio Rutter’s cross and Minteh kept his cool to slot home from close range after being set up by Welbeck.Maresca sent his players out early into the cold Sussex night for the second half but the break did not appear to make much difference. Rutter should have done better when set up by Minteh and could only direct his shot well over. But Minteh made no such mistake when Levi Colwill gave the ball away cheaply and Welbeck again turned provider for Brighton’s third. Malo Gusto’s reward for playing him onside was to be hauled off for Reece James, while £115m signing Caicedo was greeted with chants of “What a waste of money!” when he made way.Mitoma could only fire straight at Jörgensen after a rapid break downfield as Brighton went for the jugular. The Chelsea goalkeeper was fortunate that the substitute João Pedro could not hit the target after intercepting a terrible pass out from the back before Veltman struck a post late on. The way things have been going for Maresca, he will be grateful for small mercies.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrighton & Hove AlbionChelseamatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Ready to take the next step in his career as one of the best young American midfielders in the league, he wouldn’t have had any other realistic option. This offseason, though, the landscape shifted; McGlynn ended up in Houston instead.The Dynamo utilised a new mechanism introduced by the league last month to sign McGlynn for an initial $2.1m in what is now called a ‘cash-for-player’ trade. This same mechanism was used for FC Cincinnati’s $5m deal sending former MVP Luciano Acosta toFC Dallas, and also Sporting KC’s capture of striker Dejan Joveljić from the LA Galaxy for $4m. “Without the new mechanism it’s very, very, very unlikely that Dejan would have been with us,” said SKC sporting director Mike Burns.FC Dallas completes $5m swoop for former MLS MVP Luciano Acosta from FC CincinnatiRead moreThese moves go against a tide that had been swelling inMLS, with the current carrying away many of the league’s best players. Thiago Almada left Atlanta United last summer for Botafogo (and ultimately Lyon through a multi-club pipeline). Diego Gómez joined Brighton from Inter Miami while Cucho Hernández departed the Columbus Crew for Real Betis on deadline day.Of course, this has long been the conventional career path for MLS’s best, most promising players. Before Almada, Gomez and Cucho there was Miguel Almirón,Taty Castellanosand countless homegrown players who used MLS as a springboard to reach the elite level of the European game. Each of these deals has netted the clubs and the league significant revenue, in addition to improving worldwide perception of MLS’s quality. It has been in MLS’s best interests to become a selling league.Now, though, the new ‘cash-for-player’ trade mechanism, as well as the U22 initiative and homegrown player rule, has opened up all sorts of pathways for MLS players and teams. MLS will continue to funnel talent into the European leagues, but there will also be more moves like Joveljić and McGlynn’s.This rule change could end up being one of the most significant since MLS introduced the Designated Player. That was in 2007 – so long ago it was originally dubbed ‘The Beckham Rule.’ To this day, the DP rule is the most effective way for teams to recruit international-level players. The ‘cash-for-player’ rule now makes it more possible for those players to stick around the league for longer.Until now, there was no intra-league transfer market to speak of, at least not in the conventional sense. Teams could trade for allocation money (GAM and TAM), which flew around MLS in a way few truly understood. There was a high barrier of entry for anyone looking to engage with MLS transfer gossip in the way fans of other leagues around the world do freely. It was, and still is to a certain extent, algebra.Transfer gossip has become a sport in its own right. The constant swirling of speculation drives interest in players, teams and leagues like nothing else, and at all times. It’s why Fabrizio Romano has 90 million social media followers. MLS’s convoluted roster rules and trade restrictions has always made the league’s transfer gossip hard work. ‘Cash-for-players’ could help.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is to be welcomed even if the salary budget remains the main limiting factor on what clubs can and can’t do in their roster construction.As leagues around the world struggle to balance growing inequality between the richest clubs and the rest, MLS is right to maintain a sense of parity. This is an increasingly valuable point of difference at a time when the Bundesliga has been won by the same club in 11 of the last 12 seasons and Manchester City have dominated the Premier League for the last decade or so.The ‘cash-for-player’ mechanism won’t necessarily result in stronger teams, but it could do more to spread talent across MLS. The NFL and NBA have broad leaguewide appeal in part because just about every team has at least one superstar. By making it easier for teams like Sporting KC, a team that finished second-bottom of the Western Conference last season, to attract players like Joveljić, one of the best pure strikers in the league, MLS has edged closer to achieving something similar.The real impact of the ‘cash-for-players’ mechanism won’t become apparent for another couple of seasons. Across the league, general managers and front offices are still deciphering how the rule change will affect their roster builds and plans for the future. The early movements, however, suggest most clubs plan on using it in some way.For players, the benefits are obvious – those who are signed using the new mechanism are entitled to 10% of the transfer fee. They also have more freedom to improve their situation in a soccer sense. McGlynn, for example, was an awkward fit for the Philadelphia Union’s high-pressing style. In Houston, though, he has joined a team that will play to his strengths on the ball.“This is a step towards bringing MLS’s player movement standards in line with international norms,” a MLS Players Association spokesperson told The Athletic.There have been more of those steps lately; the league has shifted the summer transfer window to align with the English and European window. ‘Off-roster homegrowns’ will also have a clearer pathway from MLS Next Pro thanks to another rule tweak.Deals like the ones involving Joveljic and McGlynn, however, could reshape MLS. There’s now nothing to stop Real Salt Lake bidding for Messi.Explore more on these topicsMLSLA GalaxySporting Kansas CityFC DallasHouston DynamoPhiladelphia UnionTransfer windowfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One of us hit on the rise of a certain rookie though …Melissa JacobsFri 14 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 18.08 ESTShareCongratulations to the 99% of NFL pundits and fans whose preseason predictions have long made their way through the garbage disposal. Unfortunately, the NFL writers for the Guardian have no such luck. Our villainous editors are forcing us to turn back the clock to early September to revisit our season predictions (you can read them in full here).While we’d love to take a victory lap and say we saw all the twists and turns coming, that’s not exactly the case (though we did nail a few). So, let’s rip off the Band-Aid and see how our prognostications panned out.Best team that won’t make the playoffsWhat we said before the season:We thoughtthe Jets, Colts, and Bears would be good, but not good enough. We also picked a 10 to 11 win season for the Bears, thinking they would only miss the postseason due to their powerful division. Conversely, one of us thoughtBuffalo could miss out“given that the offense is weaker without a blue-chip prospect.”What actually happened:The Jets and Bears struggled from the startand fired their head coaches before December. Both franchises finished 5-12 and have many issues to repair before even thinking about a playoff run. The Colts narrowly missed out, finishing 8-9 in an AFC South where hovering right below .500 lands you in playoff contention. As for the Bills, who earned an AFC Championship berth, their offense was anything but weak thanks toNFL MVP Josh Allen. Only the Detroit Lions scored more points than Buffalo this season.MVPWhat we said before the season: Patrick Mahomes or CJ Stroud?Our writers were split. We picked Mahomes thanks to a “rejuvenated offense” and because “he still can lead the Chiefs to those inexplicable comeback victories.” Stroud got votes because we thought his new offensive weapons, Joe Mixon and Stefon Diggs, could catapult the second-year slinger to 30-plus touchdowns.What actually happened: Allen (27 first-place votes) narrowly won the awardover Lamar Jackson (23 first-place votes). The Chiefs offense, meanwhile, was anything but rejuvenated. Mahomes’ connection with Travis Kelce waned as the season wore on. Though Mahomes pulled a rabbit out the hat many times this season, it was the Kansas City defense that led the way. Stroud’s shiny new wideout, Diggs, tore his ACL in October. Stroud threw 20 touchdowns and while he showed flashes of greatness, he was also on the ground a lot and regressed from his superb rookie season.View image in fullscreenWe told you he was good …Photograph: Geoff Burke/USA Today SportsRookie to watchWhat we said before the season:We devoured theCaleb Williams hype, with two of us salivating at the quarterback’s offensive weapons. We also gave a nod to Colts’ defensive endLaiatu Latu, believing he could touch double-digit sacks in his debut campaign. One of our writers was sage enough to see the greatness ofJayden Danielsearly, believing his numbers would be boosted thanks to Washington often “playing from behind.”Patrick Mahomes was chasing Super Bowl history. He left humbled and harassedRead moreWhat actually happened:Williams had a subpar rookie campaign, marred by bad coaching and holding on to the ball too long. He was sacked a whopping 68 times, the third-most in NFL history. Latu, the first defender taken in the 2024 draft, was disappointing with just 16 solo tackles and four sacks. The home for disruptive rookie defenders proved to be in Los Angeles as Rams outside linebackerJared Versewon Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. His teammate, Braden Fiske, finished third.Daniels, the clear Offensive Rookie of the Year, was an absolute revelation. He led the Commanders to a 7-2 start, capped off bya Hail Mary win over Chicago. It soon became clear that the dual-threat Daniels was a generational talent.AFC East championWhat we said before the season:One of us believed the “indefatigable” Allen would lead Buffalo to another AFC East title.Two of us picked the Dolphins, more as an indictment of Buffalo’s defense, “for the first time in the Sean McDermott era, they’re lacking ability and depth at linebacker and safety.” Then there’s the writer who didn’t even mention the Bills and thoughtthe Jetswould take the title because the “sky’s the limit.” Be nice: the same writer was first on the Daniels bandwagon.What actually happened:The Dolphins finished below .500 in a division where half the teams are rebuilding and, shocker, capped off the season with Tyreek Hill throwing in the towel.Buffalo ran away with the division.AFC North championWhat we said before the season: Most of us picked the Ravenswith some heavy doting on Jackson (“Explosive! Sensational!”), though we did see some potential weak spots with Baltimore’s “brittle offensive line; and a new, first-time defensive coordinator.” One vote went tothe Bengalsbased largely on Burrow’s renewed health. His blond hair only added to the swagger. Not a word about Pittsburgh or Cleveland.What actually happened: The Ravens took the AFC North titlefor the second-straight year. Jackson, who proved impossible to contain, put up better numbers than his two MVP years. Derrick Henry was a juggernaut, finishing with his highest yards per carry total of his career. The Bengals started slow but finished with a five-game win streak and narrowly missed the playoffs. But it was Mike Tomlin and the Steelers who proved again to be a model of consistency (some might say consistently above average but not spectacular). There was a lot to like about the 10-7 Steelers, who earned a playoff bid, even if they fizzled on the final stretch.AFC South championWhat we said before the season: It wasa Texans sweepfor our writers who all believed Stroud’s encore to his rookie season would be special, and that “Houston’s defense will rise to match Stroud and the offense.” There was no love for the Jaguars who our writers predicted would “plummet” under “one-hit wonder head coach Doug Pederson.”What actually happened:Here’s something we don’t get to say often in this space –we were right!Other than hapless New England and Dallas, Houston didn’t dominate anyone or upset any juggernauts on the way to the AFC South crown. But at 10-7, they got the job done. We were also right on the defense making strides; they finished sixth in the league with 315 total yards allowed per game. As for the Jags, their defense was among the NFL’s worst and Pederson was let go after an embarrassing 4-13 season.AFC West championWhat we said before the season:Did anyone have the guts to pick anyone other than the owners of the division for almost a decade? No way. We pointed out that the Jim Harbaugh-Justin Herbert pairing was intriguing, but the rest of the Chargers roster was “barren … Outside the offensive line, the team is either slow or old.” Yeah,clean sweep for the Chiefs.What actually happened:Shocker,the Chiefs won the division yet again, but this iteration of the AFC West was arguably the best in football, along with the NFC North. It wasn’t quite as pretty as usual for the Chiefs with a struggling offense and holes across the board. But wins are wins and Kansas City collected 15 of them, including two against the Chargers, their biggest divisional threat. The Harbaugh-Herbert pairing was as advertised – until the playoffs anyway – and the defense outperformed expectations in the first half of the season. At 11-6, Los Angeles secured the No 5 seed, while the surprising Denver Broncos snagged a third AFC playoff spot at 10-7. Denver and Sean Payton appear to have found their guy in rookie Bo Nix.NFC East championWhat we said before the season: All four of us picked the Eagles, though one of considered Dallas for a moment. We loved the additions of Kellen Moore and Vic Fangio to Nick Sirianni’s staff and agreed that the Eagles “have the most complete roster in the division – perhaps the whole conference.”What actually happened: We were right.The 14-3 Eagles soared to another division title thanks to such a complete and talented roster. Weirdly, the Eagles flew a bit under the radar in the regular season, despite Saquon Barkley’s historic run aided by the best offensive line in football, a punishing defensive front four, and two of the best coordinators in football.What we didn’t see coming were the Commanders, who earned a playoff berth at 12-5. Daniels was the story, but Dan Quinn deserves a lot of credit for fast-forwarding a rebuild after Washington finished 4-13 in 2023.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We thought the “insane defensive line starring Aidan Hutchinson and a (hopefully healthy soon) DJ Reader … will catapult the Lions to a deep playoff run” but did acknowledge a “momentous battle could be in the making between Detroit and Green Bay.” One of us expected “Chicago to make some noise as well.” We did project that three teams would finish with at least 10 wins though did not specify which three.What actually happened: Three NFC North teams did, in fact, top 10 wins. The division winner Lions finished 15-2 thanks to their 33.2 points scored per game, the most in the NFL. Coordinators Ben Johnson and Aaron Glenn were wizards, with Glenn’s defense surviving the loss of its best player in Hutchinson. Green Bay hung in there at 11-6 and finished third but struggled mightily without a bona fide WR1. It was the Sam Darnold-led 14-3 Vikings who helped Minnesota finish as division runners-up. Darnold looked like a changed quarterback for the first 17 weeks of the season before imploding in Week 18 against Detroit with the division title and home field on the line. Chicago, with just five wins, finished in some deep crevice of the division’s basement.NFC South championWhat we said before the season:Three of us pickedTampa “by default.”We said some nice things about Baker Mayfield but mostly wanted to move on. One bold soul picked the Falcons. “Kirk Cousins can unlock Kyle Pitts and Drake London’s massive potential.”What actually happened:10-7 wasmore than enough for Tampa to take the division. Mayfield was fun to watch but you never got the sense this team could make a deep playoff run, especially with an atrocious pass defense. Atlanta finished 8-9 but Cousins deteriorated as the season wore on and was eventually benched for rookie Michael Penix Jr.NFC West championWhat we said before the season:Weall picked the 49erscoming off theirSuper Bowlappearance. We thought San Francisco would “roll to the division title” with its “all-star cast.” Seattle’s explosive offensive intrigued us and most of us thought the Rams would be in the mix, “earning a home playoff game.” One of us wasn’t sold on the “Rams having a repeat of last year’s surprise with no Aaron Donald around.”What actually happened:The49ers shockingly fell from first to worst, occupying the NFC West basement for the first time since 2020. So many things went wrong for San Francisco, from Christian McCaffrey’s injury limiting him to five (largely unproductive) games to defensive coordinator Nick Sorensen being overmatched to all theDeebo Samuel drama. The Rams and Seahawks finished 10-7, with Los Angeles winning the title via tiebreaker. Coaching mastermind Sean McVay and a young defense led the charge. The Rams entered the postseason on a defensive roll, holding four of their last five opponents to under 10 points. Seattle had plenty of offensive explosiveness, but it was their improved defense that helped secure their third straight winning season.AFC ChampionshipWhat we said before the season: We loved Kansas City,with one writer picking them over the Ravens and two others over the Texans. One of us flipped the script andpicked Houston to top the Chiefs.White cornerback, Black QB: did Eagles grab ultimate DEI Super Bowl win?Read moreWhat actually happened:Chiefs! Bills!The matchupwe all wanted but no one predicted. As Buffalo entered Arrowhead, this felt like Allen’s best chance to finally beat Mahomes in the playoffs. But, as was the trademark of the Chiefs’ season, they found a way topull out a dramatic, narrow win. Buffalo won the total yards and turnover battle, but the Chiefs made key stops when it counted most. How many more times can Buffalo mentally handle saying “there’s always next year”?NFC ChampionshipWhat we said before the season:Two of us had Detroit winning, one over San Francisco, the other over Green Bay. We also picked Green Bay over Philadelphia, and San Francisco over Green Bay.What actually happened:No one sawWashington making it this far, even as the playoffs began, and especially when they headed to Detroit. Daniels and Co stunned the Lions 45-31,turning us all into believers. Had we given deeper thought to our claims about how complete a team Philadelphia was, perhaps we would have offered up more respect.The Eagles’ 55-23 winover Washington was about as lopsided as it gets. Or so we thought.View image in fullscreenWe should have seen it coming …Photograph: David J Phillip/APSuper BowlWhat we said before the season: Two of us believed inthe inevitability of the Chiefs’ three-peat. “Bet against Patrick Mahomes. I won’t.”One of us picked the Packersdespite claiming of Kansas City, “this may be the best team the Mahomes-Reid-Spagnuolo trifecta have rolled out yet.” Our other pick wasthe Texanson the strength of their defense.What actually happened:Wanna talk defense?Hello Eagles. Fangio’s crew stagedan absolute beatdownof the Chiefs in a 40-22 rout. Philly’s defensive line walloped the Chiefs, sacking Mahomes six times, the most of his career. Even more impressive is the fact that Fangio didn’t dial up a single blitz. This Super Bowl was among Mahomes’s worst performances in a big game. His passes were off-target and he looked off-balance from the start of the game.Congratulations to the Eagles – and to us for being not quite as wrong as we could have been. But we still learned a few things. Inevitability is a myth. Complete teams are the ideal. Oh, and never ever pick the Jets.Explore more on these topicsNFLKansas City ChiefsPhiladelphia EaglesUS sportsSuper BowlShareReuse this content"

But like everything, it will all depend on how well he can adapt to the car and how well he can adapt to the team.”Williams finished ninth out of 10 last season and are still in a process of rebuilding, with their sights set on the regulation changes in 2026 to really enjoy the fruits of their labour. However Sainz, his Thai-British teammate Alex Albon and the team principal, James Vowles, were all confident they had made significant steps forward with this year’s car, and expected to be more competitive in 2025.Albon also noted there was no little disquiet among drivers over the FIA’s recently announced rule amendments that will impose heavy fines for swearing and that may even lead to race bans.“There’s definitely been discussions about it. We’re still ongoing about how we want to set out what we say around it,” he said. “It is a delicate matter – do we think it’s right? Of course not.”The FIA’s stance may lead to confrontation later in the season. The clampdown is understood to have been led by the FIA president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, and last year it provoked fury from Max Verstappen when he was given a community service punishment for swearing in a press conference. The drivers responded by demandingthe FIA treats them like adults.At the Williams launch Albon noted he did not believe drivers should be “monetised” by the FIA. Last season, when they demanded to know where the money from fines was spent, Ben Sulayem said it was “none of their business”.Explore more on these topicsLewis HamiltonFerrariFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

After two weeks of working on the crux pitches, she climbed the entire route in a single push, becoming the first woman to climb a 5.14b big wall, breaking a major barrier in the sport.Then a sport climber, DiGiulian was incredibly strong on single-pitch routes, but unaccustomed to the complexity of big walls. “I had climbed 5.14d, so I thought the 5.14b pitches wouldn’t be so hard, but I learned how much the logistics, weather, and fatigue add up,” she says.Big wall climbing forced DiGiulian to embrace a greater sense of adventure and combine multiple skills, which became her new obsession. “I love long days on the wall, working on a project, being away from the chaos of the rest of life,” DiGiulian says. “It’s all-encompassing.”However, breaking the barrier came with its own set of challenges. Despite leading all of the hard pitches of Bellavista, online trolls claimed that her climbing partner, Edu Marin, had led her up the route. “Every time I do a project with a guy, people assume my partner leads the hard pitches, even if there is photo or video evidence otherwise,” DiGiulian says. “It’s really aggravating.”Fortunately DiGiulian had bonafides to back it up. After an undefeated run as a competition climber, winning four PanAmerican titles, three National titles, and Female Overall World Championships title in 2011, she transitioned to sport climbing, then to big walls. She has more than 30 female first ascents and 12 first ascents, most recently leading an all-women team up a 2,000-foot limestone wall in Spain dubbed “the hardest multi-pitch route ever climbed by an all-female team.”After each groundbreaking climb, a steady stream of harassment would follow. In 2018 DiGiulian shared her experience being bullied in anInstagram post that quickly went viral. “It had been building for a long time, away from the public eye,” recounts DiGiulian. “I had tried to resolve it in other ways, but nothing worked. I’m glad that I said something.” The post became a watershed moment, catalyzing a much larger conversation about sexism in climbing.View image in fullscreenSasha DiGiulianPhotograph: Keith LadzinskiDiGiulian believes a lot of the skepticism comes from being an outsider. “I don’t look or act like a stereotypical climber. I’m not a dirtbag eating cans of tuna; I had blood fingers with pink nails.” DiGiulian says. “I’m a kid from the big city with feminine traits, which led people to not believing my story.”Growing up in New York City, DiGiulian started climbing when she was just six years old at her brother’s birthday party. At 12, she won her first Continental Championships and soon after signed her first sponsor, MadRock. After graduating high school she won her first World Champs, then deferred her acceptance to Columbia University to focus on climbing.Months later she sent Pure Imagination, an iconic route in the Red River Gorge, on just her sixth try. At the time it was rated 5.14d, making her the first North American woman to climb the grade. The news made headlines around the world and landed her a guest appearance on Oprah.“I’ve been in the spotlight since I was a teenager,” DiGiulian says. “Over my career, I opened doors and got bloody going through them, but hopefully that helps female climbers have less friction. That would make me happy, for others to have less criticism.”When she was young, DiGiulian said the pressure would get to her more. “I was dealing with an eating disorder, so being fat shamed was really hard on my mental health,” she says. “There are people who count my entire career as a fraud or fake. We say haters gonna hate, but I’m not bulletproof.”In 2020 DiGiulian’s career was derailed by hip dysplasia. “My femur would pop out of its socket while training and an MRI showed that my cartilage was degenerating,” she says. The injury resulted in five surgeries, which took two years to recover from. “I was flattened, literally and figuratively. I had to find a purpose outside of climbing.”She used the time to write a book and start a company, while working on her mental health. “Therapy helped a lot. I turned over a lot of stones and found ways to stop listening to the haters. I’ve always felt like an outsider and the break helped me recognize that I don’t need to be an insider to feel grounded.”View image in fullscreenSasha DiGiulianPhotograph: Courtesy of Sasha DiGiulianHer company, Send Bars, focuses on issues she cares about most. “Climbing is a sport with a lot of eating disorders and lack of nutrition. It can be unhealthy at times, but food can be empowering if we allow it to. That’s the goal of the company.”The confidence gained away from climbing helped when she returned to the sport. “After most female sends, the routes are immediately downgraded by male climbers,” DiGiulian says, “but I’ve learned to just be proud of what I’ve done and confident in who I am.”Downgrading is assigning a lower grade to a route after it’s established, ostensibly due to factors like the rock changing over time. However, it is often used as a subtle way to demote the accomplishments of female climbers, one of the ways that sexism shows up in climbing.Despite her public appeal for more respect in the climbing community, DiGiulian still receives malicious messages and negative comments about her weight, makeup, clothes and relationships. “I get a lot of hate for being a sellout,” says DiGiulian, “but now see that a lot of it comes from jealousy.”Over time, she has learned to use negativity as fuel. “I know I’m challenging the hierarchy of climbing. Bro culture is threatened by my success, so they try to take me down. I try to focus on the positive impact I’ve had, like helping the sport go mainstream, creating more opportunities for everyone.”DiGiulian hopes to be remembered for establishing a new baseline for female climbers, including how they are recognized, treated and paid. For example, she was the North American climber to be sponsored by Adidas, who now has dozens of comp, sport, and big wall climbers on their roster. “I’m never going to be the strongest climber ever, but I’m proud that my success has helped create an easier path for young climbers growing into the industry.”More than anything, DiGiulian recognizes the privilege of being a professional climber. “We’re role models as much as we’re rock climbers. Going public about bullying was hard for me, but it catalyzed a massive shift towards respect and equity. It created more accountability for the actions of everyone, and that’s the golden rule in society.”Explore more on these topicsSportMountaineeringUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Brady Tkachuk bowled over 6ft 6in Niko Mikkola with one of his game-high eight hits, and Matthew Tkachuk gave Patrik Laine an earful before a faceoff as the Americans began to take over.Marner’s OT winner lifts Canada over Sweden in 4 Nations Face-Off openerRead moreThe scoreboard made it look like more of a rout than it was for the first two periods, when quality chances were at a premium and space on the ice was hard to find. Matt Boldy scored the go-ahead goal on a textbook deflection of Minnesota Wild teammate Brock Faber’s shot late in the second, then the floodgates opened early in the third.Many fans hadn’t even returned to their seats from intermission when Matthew Tkachuk sailed a long shot in past Juuse Saros 15 seconds into the period. Saros then gave up another softie to Jake Guentzel, and Brady Tkachuk beat the struggling Nashville Predators goaltender again to make it three US goals in less than three minutes.That onslaught quieted the very pro-Finland crowd full of Canadians eager to root against their country’s biggest hockey rival. Some even booed the US anthem before the game, and there was plenty more where that came from for Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews several times he touched the puck.Boo’s and whistles rain down as the U.S national anthem is sungpic.twitter.com/FelfCjhdMR— Mollie Walker (@MollieeWalkerr)February 14, 2025Matthew Tkachuk added another for good measure on the power play with 8:47 left, and that was enough for the “U-S-A! U-S-A!” chants to fill the bowl at Bell Centre. In the waning minutes, a few US fans proclaimed, “We want Canada!”Finland only gave fans one real opportunity to cheer, when late-added defenseman Henri Jokiharju beat Connor Hellebuyck clean on a shot 7:31 in to make it 1-0. Hellebuyck stopped the next 18 shots he faced to finish with 20 saves.The same could not be said for Saros, who allowed six goals on 32 shots and could be replaced in net by Kevin Lankinen for Finland’s game against Sweden on Saturday.The US do not need to worry about making a switch there, but coach Mike Sullivan made some keen midgame adjustments that contributed to his team moving to the top of the 4 Nations standings one turn through round-robin play.During the second period Sullivan moved Brady Tkachuk to left wing with Eichel and Matthew Tkachuk, and Kyle Connor to the second line alongside Matthews and Jack Hughes, and he flip-flopped his second and third defense pairs to put Noah Hanifin with Adam Fox, and Jaccob Slavin with Brock Faber.Matthew Tkachuk, fresh off winning the Stanley Cup with the Florida Panthers last season, finished with three points thanks to an assist on Ottawa captain Brady Tkachuk’s second goal of the night. Defenseman Zach Werenski also had a three-assist game.Rivalry day at the 4 Nations starts Saturday with Sweden against Finland at 1pm ET, followed by the US and Canada at 8pm.Explore more on these topicsIce hockeyUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He was shown a red card by the referee, Michael Oliver, and faces an extended touchline ban if found guilty.Hulshoff, who received his red card in the tunnel, is also accused of acting in an improper manner and/or using insulting and/or abusive words and/or behaviour towards a match official. It is further alleged that Liverpool’s assistant manager acted in an improper manner and/or used insulting and/or abusive words and/or behaviour towards a match official after being sent off.The two clubs have been charged with failing to ensure their players and/or occupants of their technical areas did not behave in an improper and/or provocative way following the final whistle.Everton, Liverpool, Slot and Hulshoff have until next Wednesday, 19 February, to respond.Speaking before the charges were issued, Slot expressed regret for allowing emotions to get the better of him on Wednesday and said he hopes to react “differently next time”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the Dutchman was contrite about his behaviour on the pitch. “I think what happened was that the extra time, the additional five minutes ended up being eight, a lot happened and emotions got the better of me,” he said. “If I look back at it, I would love to do it differently. I’m hoping to do it differently next time. What exactly has been said or what has happened, there is an ongoing process and I don’t want to disturb that. I can’t go into details.”Slot explained that several incidents caused his anger to rise during stoppage time at Goodison, and not only Oliver’s and the video assistant referee’s refusal to penalise the Everton striker Beto for a push on Ibrahima Konaté in the buildup to James Tarkowski’s 98th-minute leveller.“Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional,” he said. “There was a VAR incident for two minutes where he checked. I thought maybe the only thing that could happen was he looked back at the foul. Then I thought: ‘Maybe it’s offside?’ Then of course you hear their fans cheering and you think: ‘OK, it wasn’t offside.’ Many things happened in extra time but, like I said, it wouldn’t be smart to go into every single incident.”Liverpool will be without the suspended Jones for Sunday’s visit of Wolves. Cody Gakpo could also miss out with a foot injury sustained in the derby. Slot intends to speak to Jones about his furious reaction to Doucouré celebrating in front of the Liverpool fans, but backed the homegrown midfielder.“I like a lot that he stands up for the team – for the team and for the fans – but there are other ways to do that maybe,” said Slot. “I will talk with him about that, but it is the same for me. I should have acted differently after the game as well. It’s an emotional sport and sometimes individuals, out of emotion, make the wrong decision. That’s definitely what I did.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotEvertonnewsShareReuse this content"

A brilliant header to equalise before setting up Kaoru Mitoma’s winner gave Fabian Hürzeler’s side the confidence boost they needed after their 7-0 mauling at Nottingham Forest, with Rutter justifying his manager’s decision to leave João Pedro on the bench. Rutter – who has seven goals in all competitions – did not start a Premier League game in January after struggling with a hamstring problem and Hürzeler has been mindful of protecting the 22-year-old, although he will be itching to face Enzo Maresca’s side for the second time in six days. “There were a lot of personal duels and he proved that he can win the majority of them, and that’s why I’m happy with him,” said Hürzeler.Ed AaronsBrighton vChelsea, Friday 8pm (all times GMT)2Sterling as false 9 for depleted Arsenal?Kai Havertz suffered aseason-ending muscular injuryduring Arsenal’s winter trip to Dubai, causing further problems for Mikel Arteta. The attacking options remaining in the Gunners’ bullpen are limited, with Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli and Gabriel Jesus already watching from the sidelines. Arteta could be forced into utilising a false 9 for the trip to Leicester and the ideal option could be Raheem Sterling. The former England international has not set north London alight since moving on loan from Chelsea in the summer but has experience of playing down the middle from his time at Manchester City, some of that playing under Arteta when he was Pep Guardiola’s assistant. Sterling has become yesterday’s man, a winger that City were happy to part with and then Chelsea likewise and he is yet to prove either of those decisions wrong this season. Maybe the backing of Arteta in a key role could be the boost he needs to get back to his best. He will be confident of giving the Leicester defence something to think about.Will UnwinLeicester vArsenal, Saturday 12.30pm3Aina returns to SW6 in fine fettleOla Aina was on loan at Fulham when they went down during the 2020-21 season. The versatile full-back made 31 appearances in the Premier League, scoring twice, but the move was not made permanent and Aina returned to Torino. He had another year in Serie A before joiningNottingham Forestand is now pushing for Champions League qualification. Forest are in third before heading to Fulham on Saturday and Aina has been an important part of their rise. The 28-year-old can play on both flanks, is capable of operating as a wing-back and is adept on and off the ball. He is in fine form before taking on his old team.Jacob SteinbergFulham v Nottingham Forest, Saturday 3pm4Kudus fighting for his place under PotterMohammed Kudus is having an underwhelming season. The West Ham winger did not see eye to eye with Julen Lopetegui and he has been disappointing since returning from a five-match ban in December. Kudus has one goal in his past 12 games and was erratic in possession during West Ham’srecent defeat at Chelsea. He gave away the ball too often and must improve when Graham Potter’s side host Brentford. Potter is short of attacking options but Kudus’s place will be under threat if he has not woken up by the time Crysencio Summerville returns from a hamstring injury.JSWest Ham vBrentford, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenMohammed Kudus needs to rediscover his form against Brentford.Photograph: Ryan Browne/Shutterstock5Welington should beef up SaintsAside from their most optimistic fans,Southamptonare planning for life back in the Championship. The short-term prospects for the club are, to be polite, subpar, but they still possess a young squad with plenty of potential. They have numerous players who can lead a promotion charge, though others will be sold because they have outgrown the Saints. One of their latest arrivals, providing hope among the gloom, is the Brazilian left-back Welington. The 23-year-old defender has made two first-team appearances since arriving from São Paulo and has acquitted himself well in England, helping secure a debut win at Ipswich. A Brazil Under-23s international, Welington was aggressive in his duel with Omari Hutchinson and it is this sort of commitment Saints require at the bottom. The situation is bleak and individuals need to stand up and be counted, something Welington is eager to do.WUSouthampton vBournemouth, Saturday 3pm6Khusanov can show he is settledThe treatment table at the City training ground is mainly occupied by defenders. Manuel Akanji and Nathan Aké were forced off in midweek against Real Madrid to give Pep Guardiola a potential head-scratcher for Newcastle’s and, more specifically, Alexander Isak’s visit. Abdukodir Khusanov’s debut,against Chelsea, was a struggle for the defender and those watching through their fingertips, as everyone was left to feel sorry for the new arrival. The Uzbek had to wait for his second appearance, coming on in difficult circumstancesat Leyton Orient in the FA Cupwhere he acquitted himself well. Playing Khusanov against Chelsea was somewhat unfair, the defender having arrived in the country only days beforehand, and his mistakes were understandable in the circumstances. Time has passed and he has been offered some time to settle and will be eager to show that first impressions do not matter much in this industry.WUManchester City v Newcastle, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenAbdukodir Khusanov looks ready to put his shaky start behind him.Photograph: Adam Davy/PA7Malen and Philogene face offThe winter transfer window presentedAston Villaanother opportunity to trade. Last summer Douglas Luiz and Moussa Diaby departed for a combined total of almost £100m. Villa’s headline January sale was Jhon Durán to the Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr for an initial £65m. But the £20m exit to Ipswich of the winger Jaden Philogene, still a raw, inconsistent talent at 23, allowed them to sign Donyell Malen, a 26-year-old Netherlands regular who played in the Champions League final for Borussia Dortmund last season. It felt like a smart upgrade. Malen has been omitted from Unai Emery’s Champions League squad – the victim of the arrivals of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio on loan – but on Saturday he has another chance to impress after an encouraging first start in Villa’s FA Cup fourth-round victory against Tottenham. Philogene, too, will want to prove a point on his return to Villa Park, fresh from scoring his first Ipswich goal in a Cup win at Coventry.Ben FisherAston Villa v Ipswich, Saturday 3pm8Wharton returns as crucial piece for EaglesThe return of Adam Wharton after more than three months out in Crystal Palace’s comfortable FA Cup win against Doncaster was the latest good news for Oliver Glasner, with the England midfielder playing 62 minutes, having come on as a substitute againstManchester Unitedthe previous week. “It was the first time in my career that a player had been out for three to four months and had just one week of training with us – even then, we had to manage the training at the beginning – that I called him up for the squad,” said Glasner after the win at Old Trafford. “His performance throughout the week was impressive.” Wharton started every game for Crystal Palace last season after Glasner’s arrival in February and earned a place in Gareth Southgate’s squad for Euro 2024 for his efforts; now the 21-year-old is expected to line up alongside Will Hughes against Everton on Saturday at Selhurst Park. Glasner should also have Eddie Nketiah, Eberechi Eze and Ismaïla Sarr back as Palace attempt to build on their excellent recent form.Ed AaronsCrystal Palace v Everton, Saturday 5.30pm9Wolves may target GravenberchLiverpool’s ability to get their title push back on track against Wolves will rely heavily on how quickly Ryan Gravenberch can bounce back from a tough game at Everton. The 22-year-old has become a key figure in Arne Slot’s midfield setup after a quiet debut season, finding his stride in a deeper role. His ability to read the game and win back possession has proved essential in the leaders’ more measured approach this term. But rare signs of discomfort for Gravenberch were lit brightly under the lights at Goodison Park and revealed the vulnerabilities in Liverpool’s system when he is stifled. The physicality and pressing from Beto and Abdoulaye Doucouré nullified his influence and disrupted Liverpool’s overall rhythm. Vítor Pereira was surely watching and may well try to do the same. With a quick and clever player in Matheus Cunha at his disposal, he could make a couple of tweaks and take a page out of David Moyes’s playbook.Yara El-ShabouryLiverpool v Wolves, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenLiverpool will need a strong performance from Ryan Gravenberch to bounce back against Wolves.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock10Tel time for TottenhamMathys Tel’s consolation goal at Aston Villain the FA Cupwas a positive for Tottenham amid another defeat. The France Under-21s forward has been brought in by Ange Postecoglou to inject energy and clinical finishing into his struggling team. Manchester United were rumoured to be interested in the Bayern Munich loanee and it is obvious why the teenager was on numerous shortlists in Europe. He may not have been too keen on joining a big club in a downward spiral but playing in the Premier League and living in London were an enticing prospect. A league debut this weekend will add an element of excitement amid the battle to find out which team has slipped furthest into mediocrity thanks to long-term mismanagement. Tel will embrace the chance to show the home fans what they can expect from him, especially given his deal could be made permanent in the summer. He will also want to show what United are missing, given they allowed two of their own wingers, Marcus Rashford and Antony, to leave in the winter window, leaving them light of options.WUTottenham v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pmPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool2435572Arsenal2427503Nottm Forest2413474Chelsea2416435Man City2413416Newcastle2413417AFC Bournemouth2413408Aston Villa24-3379Fulham2443610Brighton24-33411Brentford2403112Crystal Palace24-23013Man Utd24-62914Tottenham Hotspur24112715Everton24-52716West Ham24-172717Wolverhampton24-181918Leicester24-281719Ipswich24-271620Southampton24-369Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendLiverpoolArsenalNottingham ForestChelseaManchester CityNewcastle UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

City and the league asked for further deliberations regarding the effect these aspects would have on the rules more broadly.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That answer has now been given, with the tribunal saying: “The three respects in which the APT rules and amended APT rules were unlawful cannot be severed with the result that the APT rules as a whole are void and unenforceable.”The ruling could open the door for clubs who had APT deals rejected under the original rules to seek compensation from the league.The league has authorised a new set of APT rules in the interim and those rules are not directly affected by the judgment. The league believes it has dealt with the concerns raised by the tribunal in its redrafting, butCity have challenged the new rulestoo and the same tribunal is to adjudicate on their suitability in the coming weeks.If the new rules are also adjudged to be unenforceable it will almost certainly occasion a crisis of confidence in the league’s ability to function, at the same time as the verdict on the 130 disciplinary charges brought against City is anticipated, and plans for an independent regulator for the game come close to completion in parliament.In a statement on Friday the league asserted the validity of the new rules. “The league continues to believe that the new APT rules are valid and enforceable and is pressing for an expeditious resolution of this matter,” it said. “The new APT rules are in full force and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system, including to submit shareholder loans to thePremier Leaguefor fair market value assessment.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The protest banners. The chants. It is a scene we are familiar with, the anti-Daniel Levy movement, mobilised on the High Road outside the stadium he built, and we are about to see it again.The last time was before thePremier League game against Liverpoolon 22 December and there were a couple of hundred there, along with the obligatory rubber-neckers, including the photographers who filed their pictures back to the news desks. It is amazing how the tight-angle shots come across. The tourists got out their cameraphones. Of course they did.Amorim admits Manchester United will have to sell before they buy in summerRead moreThe organisers gave away black balloons, with Levy Out written on them, and the idea was for people to release them in the 24th minute of the game. The black was for doom and gloom; the number for Levy’s 24-year chairmanship.Did anything happen? It was hard to make out a coordinated display. Luis Díaz had put Liverpool in front on 23minutes and maybe that drew the focus. Then again, there was the sight of what looked like a couple of dog-poo bags blowing around the pitch for the remainder of Liverpool’s 6-3 win. The realisation would dawn; they were burst balloons. Either way, there was a metaphor.Spurs had entered the game in 11th place. Four weeks earlier, with the team 10th,Ange Postecoglou had saidthere would be “a lot of scrutiny” on his position as the manager if they remained there at Christmas.The club are 14th before Manchester United’s visit on Sunday and Postecoglou has indeed been questioned. He has overseen the collection of seven points from 11 matches.Spurs exited the Carabao Cupand FA Cup last week at Liverpool andAston Villarespectively. They are still alive in the Europa League and that is huge for Postecoglou. Just as important has been his mastery of the narrative around his injury-ravaged squad.View image in fullscreenA banner protesting against Daniel Levy and Enic, the major shareholder in Spurs.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesThe biggest takeaway during games from their horror run has been the lack of supporter calls for Postecoglou to go. There was mockery at Villa Park last Sunday for how badly his team played in the opening 20 minutes. But the diehards do not blame him in the first instance.They blame the man who asked Postecoglou to manage for so many weeks with threadbare resources, especially throughout January when the transfer window was open. They blame the man who they believe has not gone deep enough with his investment in the squad, the lone constant from the past 24 years as managers of all profiles have come and gone with only one trophy delivered –the 2008 League Cup. They blame Levy.It is the Change for Tottenham action group that have organised Sunday’s demonstration. The plan is for fans to gather at 2.45pm where Lordship Lane meets the High Road and march peacefully to the ground. After the full-time whistle, there is to be a sit-in protest in the South Stand Lower. “This is about passion, pride and protecting our club from greed-driven failure,” the group said. “To make it clear to the board that enough is enough.”If previous actions have been underwhelming, it will be interesting to monitor this one because feelings are running high and the club have arguably never been lower in the Levy era. The 2003-04 season was a disaster under the caretaker manager David Pleat, who stepped in afterGlenn Hoddle was sacked in late September. The team were never higher than 10th, grubbing around in the lower reaches of mid-table for most of it before ending up 14th. It was early days for Levy.There was also the notorious two points from eight matches at the start of 2008-09 underJuande Ramos, which led to the call for Harry Redknapp. At about this time of the season, Redknapp had Spurs 17th but the trends were upward and they would finish eighth.What makes it more frustrating now, more difficult to fathom, is that Spurs are firmly established among the financial elite. According toDeloitte’s most recent Money League for 2023-24– published on 23 January – the club were the ninth-richest in world football with an annual turnover of £512m. This was during a season when they did not compete in Europe. Spurs’s most recent accounts for the year ended 30 June 2023 – published on 3 April 2024 – had shown record revenue of £549.6m.Commercially, 2023-24 was a blockbuster period. The top-line figure of £247.4m was up £19.65m on the previous year and was helped by the stadium’s capacity to stage concerts and other sporting events. Levy has driven this, it is down to his business acumen and there is a part of him that surely believes he has held up his end. It is not as if he has failed to spend on transfers. He has overseen an outlay of £550m in net terms on players since the rebuilt stadium opened on 3 April 2019. Levy cannot play centre-half, the area where Postecoglou has been hardest hit by injuries.Yet there are details within it all, taking in the kind of players bought, their profiles, the bets on potential. A line that damned Levy was provided by Deloitte, the one which showed Spurs’s wages-to-revenue ratio for 2023-24 was 42% – the lowest in five years and a number that was significantly lower than the other clubs in England’s “Big Six”.If you do not pay the top wages, you do not get the superstar players. The 42% spoke to excessive caution, a lack of ambition, feeding the “profit over glory” criticism from protesting supporters. In this context, the optics of Levy’s salary are not great. According to Spurs’s most recent annual report, he received remuneration of £3.581m, plus an accrued bonus of £3m paid across the year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is a buyer, agents and financiers have claimed. It is known that Amanda Staveley, the former Newcastle director who brokered the Saudi takeover at St James’ Park four years ago, has become a figure of influence at Spurs.The Guardian reported on Wednesday that a group of private Qatari investors were looking to get on board.View image in fullscreenTottenham have tumbled out of both domestic cup competitions in February.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockSpurs’s ownership structure shifted on 5 October 2022 when Joe Lewis, the billionaire businessman and ultimate benefactor, stepped back from his publicly stated position. He ceased to be a part of the Lewis Family Trust which controls Spurs, transferring it to unnamed members of his family.The 88-year-old Lewis has subsequently endured a well-documented fall from grace. Charged with insider trading in the US on 26 July 2023, he was sentenced to three years of probation and fined $5m (£4m) on 4 April 2024.The Lewis Family Trust owns 70.12% of Enic, the company that holds 86.58% of the shares in Spurs. Levy and certain members of his family own the other 29.88% of Enic. Lewis has two children, Vivienne and Charles, and the family’s interest at Spurs is being looked after by two trustees. Vivienne attends Spurs games but she does not have an input into the day-to-day running of the club.The Guardian understands that the Lewis family are open to selling but what of Levy? He is consumed with Spurs, working around the clock to make them better and push the brand, especially in North America. Could he walk away? Perhaps not, which is why his staying on to run the club under new ownership if there were a sale ought not to be discounted.Postecoglou is focused on the Manchester United match. He has had it circled in his diary for a while, describing it at the end of January as a “point for us to relaunch our campaign”, mindful as he was that some of his injured players would be back.How is that looking? The goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario is poised to return to the starting XI and Destiny Udogie and James Maddison are expected to be in the squad. Brennan Johnson, Timo Werner and Wilson Odobert are back in training. Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, Radu Dragusin, Dominic Solanke and Richarlison remain out.Postecoglou said that centre-half Van de Ven had been to see a biomechanical expert outside the club as they seek to get to the root of his hamstring issue and “make sure his body is better equipped to handle the kind of athlete he is”. Van de Ven – and Romero, for that matter – may have to be patient. It is not a commodity that is in plentiful supply at Spurs.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecogloufeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday it emerged that Ratcliffe is to cut as many as 200 employees, having previously made 250 redundancies in the summer and autumn.On Wednesday it was reported that Ratcliffe is undertaking these and other money-saving measures toavoid the club going bankrupt, after it lost £300m in the past three years. While United are yet to officially confirm the new redundancies, the email suggests this and other matters will be discussed at the meeting.Ratcliffe is being cast as Scrooge but Glazers made Manchester United’s mess | Jamie JacksonRead moreIt says: “We are aware of media reports this week speculating on a number of issues relating to the club. We recognise this is unsettling for you all. In terms of what has been reported there is no further information that we can share with you at this point. However, we will hold a team briefing on Monday 24 February at 2.30pm during which we’ll be able to talk to you further.It will come as no surprise that the club must explore every option, including reducing costs and raising revenues. There are no final decisions currently.”Ruben Amorim has admitted Manchester United will have to sell players before they can strengthen in the summer window due to straitened finances.During the recent window, United could afford only a£25.1m outlay on the full-back Patrick Dorgufrom Lecce and £1.5m on the centre-back Ayden Heaven from Arsenal. While this was possible without sales, Amorim has warned that a summer repeat will not be possible in regard to permanent transfers.View image in fullscreenRuben Amorim accepts the club will have to sell before they can add to their squad.Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Richard Sellers/Apl/Sportsphoto“Here is simple – to do something we need to sell players,” said the head coach. “We cannot do [signings] now. The window is closed. We need to focus on the games that we have, especially the next one, and then in the summer we will see.”Ratcliffe’s Mission 21 and Project 150 are plans for United to win a 21st league title by the club’s 150th anniversary in 2028. “Yes, we talk about that,” Amorim said.I sense from day one our focus is to win the Premier League, and we can change everything in a few years. I don’t know how long it is going to take.

Ilias Chair scored twice, with Koki Saito and Ronnie Edwards also on target on a disastrous first day at the office for the new Rams manager.Eustace raised eyebrows this week by leaving Blackburn, a side challenging for promotion to the Premier League, for one battling against the drop into League One. While Rovers are fifth, Derby’s humbling in west London meant they slipped into the bottom three on goal difference. Eustace certainly knew what was in store for his new side on Friday night, as his final league match with Rovers was a 2-1 defeat at Loftus Road just 10 days earlier.Blackburn risk burnout as Venky’s blunder in waving goodbye to EustaceRead moreDerby had actually started with a lot more purpose than in recent weeks, but that disappeared the moment they fell behind to the home side’s first shot on target. Michael Frey did well to hold the ball up between three Derby defenders on the corner of the penalty area before smuggling it out to Chair. The Moroccan midfielder let the ball run across his body, turned and launched a rocket past the dive of the visiting goalkeeper Jacob Widell Zetterström and into the top corner.Derby could have equalised when a headed clearance dropped to Ebou Adams just inside the box but he blazed the chance over the crossbar and then Frey almost topped Chair’s strike with an even more spectacular effort, but his first-time volley from 25 yards flew narrowly wide.View image in fullscreenDerby’s new manager John Eustace applauds the fans after his team’s defeat at Loftus Road.Photograph: John Walton/PABut moments later Rangers did have a second after Chair pinged a low cross into the area. Zetterström dived out to block the danger but succeeded only in pushing the ball to the feet of Saito, who took a sideways touch before lashing into the roof of the net from six yards.Eustace’s first half-time team talk needed to be a good one, but whatever the message was it failed to have the desired effect. Just before the hour mark Chair had his second, and QPR’s third, when he tucked away a cutback from the Tottenham loanee Yang Min-hyeok.Then Edwards, on loan from Southampton, headed the fourth from Kenneth Paal’s free-kick as Rangers, who could be dark horses for the playoffs, wrapped up a seventh win in eight home outings. A miserable night for Eustace was summed up when his side finally created a decent chance only for Kayden Jackson to stab it over from three yards out.“Obviously I’m really disappointed with the result,” said Eustace after the match. “I learnt a lot about the group tonight, and there’s lots I’m excited about. There is also lots we can improve on.”“I thought we started well but the goal they scored knocked the wind out of our sails. Then we didn’t defend the box well enough for the second, third and fourth goals. I know this group of players is going to fight for every point and the hard work starts on Monday. We’ve got an exciting week ahead on the training pitch and lots to work on.”On the impending relegation battle he faces with the club where he ended his playing career, Eustace added: “I’ve come to Derby not just for the short term but for the long term, and it’s my job now to give as much confidence as I can to the players. You can see they are low on confidence at the moment.”The QPR manager, Martí Cifuentes, said he “liked a lot of things about the performance” as his side bounced back from midweek defeat to Coventry. “We didn’t really know what to expect from them [Derby] but everybody was so committed.“Ilias Chair is one of the best players in the league,” Cifuentes added. “I’m glad he got two goals. He’s a bit angry at me for taking him off because he wanted a hat-trick. We are happy he is playing well.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipQPRDerby Countymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was only when Al-Nassr walked away from a deal for Leverkusen’s Victor Boniface and bought Jhon Durán from Aston Villa that the Bundesliga champions were forced to stand aside, paving the way for West Ham to ramp up talks with Brighton and bring Ferguson to east London for the rest of the season.It was a move that made sense for all parties. West Ham had the solution to their injury crisis in attack, Ferguson had the chance for a fresh start and Brighton had not lost complete control of a potentially lucrative asset. There is no option or obligation to buy and there is a good chance there will be a big market for Ferguson this summer if he rediscovers his goalscoring touch. Paul Winstanley, Chelsea’s co-sporting director, was previously at Brighton and is well aware of the Irishman’s talent.Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreFor Graham Potter, though, there is no point in worrying about whether West Ham will be able to sign Ferguson permanently. “I don’t think we should think like that,” the head coach said before his team host Brentford on Saturday afternoon. “We should think about how we can help Evan enjoy his football, bring the quality that we know he has. Let’s just focus on that. Let’s focus on having the best 14 matches we can.”Is Ferguson ready to be thrown in from the start? Potter could tread carefully, even though Niclas Füllkrug andMichail Antonio are long-term absentees. He is conscious of Ferguson’s recent return from an ankle injury. The forward was out for six weeks before a late appearance as a substitute duringBrighton’s 7-0 defeatat Nottingham Forest this month and his confidence has waned during a period in which he has gone from being talked of as a £100m player to being written off as another youngster given too much, too soon.Expectations have to be kept realistic. Ferguson was hugely exciting when he burst on to the scene during the 2022-23 season and scored 10 goals in 25 appearances. He looked explosive and there were comparisons to Harry Kane. It all looked so natural when Ferguson scoreda hat-trick against Newcastleat the start of the following campaign. His rise seemed unstoppable. There was constant noise about a big-money move. Football, though, has a funny way of dragging people down.The conversation changed when Ferguson’s form slowed after the win over Newcastle. Close watchers of Brighton wondered whether the Republic of Ireland international, who finished last season with six goals, was suited to Roberto De Zerbi’s style of play. The former Brighton striker Warren Aspinall has argued Ferguson was set back by “the De Zerbi way of coming short for everything”. Potter will want him to be a focal point, stretch defences and make space for Jarrod Bowen, Lucas Paquetá and Mohammed Kudus.View image in fullscreenInjuries have hampered Evan Ferguson’s progress in the last couple of years.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPABut West Ham fans must be patient with Ferguson. He has been hit by a variety of injuries, slowing his momentum, and went almost a year without scoring for club or country before Brighton’s 2-2 draw with Wolves last October.Ferguson was no longer terrorising defences. He was behind João Pedro, Georginio Rutter and Danny Welbeck at Brighton and could not earn the trust of Fabian Hürzeler, who replaced De Zerbi last summer. Ferguson has made only two league starts under Hürzeler and his ball retention was criticised by the German after he was substituted after an hour against Newcastle in October.The hope has to be that a reunion with a familiar face gets Ferguson back on track. There is an obvious benefit to working with someone as measured as Potter. He gave Ferguson his debut at Brighton and knows all too well how reputations can be torn to shreds afterhis torrid time at Chelsea.“Sometimes with young players we jump in too quickly,” Potter said. “I think until you’ve made 50 appearances, it’s always a good number to go: ‘OK, now we can assess where things are.’ And if you’ve had some injuries it’s not easy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But injuries can stop you and all of a sudden you haven’t played as much, you haven’t scored as much and then you’re not quite the same thing. But the quality is still there.

It was his understanding of the game – when to drop into space, how he received the ball. The quality of the finishes was almost like there’s a calmness to him that made you think it wasn’t a 17-year-old.”Ferguson played as if in his 20s. “He’s a calm guy, he’s level‑headed, he understands the game,” Potter said. “Really good finisher, works hard off the ball, just wants to play. A good team player. Hopefully we can help him. He needs to be on the pitch regularly.

But I sense they want to move on and get rid of this past as quickly as they can.“It was good to hear what they had to say. My gut feeling of them is they want us to spend. When I say that I mean they want us to buy the correct players. There will be a lot of change here because there are a lot of players out of contract in the summer. How quick can we build that up? I don’t think you expect it to be done in one transfer window. This will be the first summer transfer window for TFG and maybe from there we will start to judge it more.”Moyes signed a two-and-a-half year contract when he replaced Sean Dyche as manager last month and believes TFG’s vision matches his strengths. “I think my biggest quality would be building football clubs and trying to take them on,” he said. “I think that if I get the chance, I can do that. But everybody wants it done in a rush. When Everton had the last owners they probably had more money than they’ve ever had. This might not be a club that can get built that way. This might need to be a club that gets built with progress year-on-year.“I don’t think we’re going to have enough money to say we will suddenly be back competing again.

Arteta said the “unexpected” injury had occurred when Havertz tried to block a free-kick in training but insisted the team’s experiences with adversity would make them resolute over the closing weeks.Akanji out for 10 weeks, Slot’s regret, Arsenal injuries, and more: football news – liveRead more“We were having a great camp in Dubai, recharging, training, having some time off and connecting again with nature in a different environment, and then the injury happened in a very unexpected way,” Arteta said. “Certainly it is a big blow because of the injuries that we have but, fortunately, we’ve been through a lot this season.“We have played without Gabriel Magalhães, without William Saliba, Ben White all season, TakehiroTomiyasu all season, Riccardo Calafiori for two months, Mikel Merino for two months, Martin Ødegaard for two months, Bukayo Saka for three months, Gabriel Jesus … all of them. So that’s it, that’s the challenge ahead. I love it and look forward because we are still where we are with all the things I mentioned on top of playing four times with 10 men, blah blah blah. Let’s see what the team is made of.“We’ve been through a lot and we have sustained the level of performance and results until this point, so we are more than capable of doing it. That’s the only thing that we’re going to be looking at.”Arteta said he did not intend to hasten Saka’s return to the first team, describing it as “too early”, but denied the England forward had experienced a relapse in recovery from his hamstring injury. “There’s no setback, he’s fine,” Arteta said. White is fit to return to the squad for the first time since Novemberfor Saturday’s early kick-off at Leicester.By way of further motivation, Arteta watched Liverpool drop points this week, thanks to theirlate derby draw at Goodison Park. Arteta was on the cover of the programme, in his former life as an Everton midfielder, and said James Tarkowski’s late strike could help change the momentum in the title race.“When the gap becomes a bit smaller than you expected, it’s always really positive,” he said. “You need that, generating momentum, and the next few weeks are going to be critical as well to understand where we are after the international break, with six or seven weeks to go in the season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I really respect Erling and what he’s done in his career is unbelievable, but we really love Alex.”Where Haaland is perhaps more of a traditional forward and has a set tactical role in Pep Guardiola’s side, Isak remains a somewhat unconventional frontman. “I don’t think you can compare Alex to anyone,” said Howe. “Alex is very, very different to any other striker I’ve seen or worked with.“He does things that aren’t like your traditional centre-forward. He’s almost a winger combined into a striker’s mentality because his footwork and dribbling ability is so good. That’s almost winger-like and then you put him into the middle of the pitch and, with his pace and technical ability and exceptional finishing, he’s sort of got the whole package linked into one. He’s very unique and I’d encourage him to stay that way.”City’s recent stumbles have opened the door to potential Champions League qualification for Newcastle as Howe’s Carabao Cup finalists enter a crucial run of fixtures. “This is a tough period of games and, in the Premier League, is probably season-defining,” said Newcastle’s manager, whose side are sixth, level on points with fifth-placed City, and face Nottingham Forest at home next Sunday before visiting Liverpool the following Wednesday.Howe’s cause is aided by his willingness to be tactically adaptable and alter Newcastle’s high-intensity pressing approach when circumstances demand. But he does not agree with suggestions that the more positional brand of football that revolutionised English football following Guardiola’s arrival at City is all but over.“Interesting question,” Howe said. “I don’t think positional play is dead but the game is always evolving and you’ve got to keep changing with it. It’s certainly evolved from three or four years ago. The perfect system doesn’t really exist.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But on the other hand if all the players do what they want, you have chaos. You do need structure but I do think that, if you go too far one way, it’s a negative.”Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedEddie HoweErling HaalandManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

Barclay was also a prolific writer of football books as well as an engaging and charismatic voice on the sport for various radio and television shows, most notably Sky Sports’ Sunday Supplement.“It is with the greatest sadness that we must announce the death of our dear Patrick Barclay,” read a statement from Barclay’s family. “A celebration of Patrick’s life will be held at a later date. Meanwhile, we hope that the family’s wish for privacy is respected.”Rossi ruins golden dreamRead moreBorn and raised in Dundee and a fan of Dundee FC, Barclay joined the Guardian as a subeditor from the city’s Evening Telegraph newspaper in the 1970s, before becoming a football writer. He worked alongside the Guardian’sfootball correspondent, David Lacey. When the Independent launched in 1986, Barclay became the paper’s first football correspondent . He moved to the Observer in 1991 and five years later became football correspondent for the Sunday Telegraph, a post he held until 2008.View image in fullscreenPatrick Barclay, pictured in February 2009, shortly after joining the Times.Photograph: Graham HughesA year later Barclay became the Times’s chief football commentator and remained in that role until December 2011. A year later he began writing for the Evening Standard, the last newspaper he worked for. Overall, Barclay covered seven World Cups, eight European Championships and four Africa Cup of Nations, as well as serving as chairman of the Football Writers’ Association.Barclay’s most acclaimed book was probably his 2005 profile of José Mourinho, Anatomy of a Winner. His other titles include Bloody Hell!: The Biography of Alex Ferguson, The Life and Times of Herbert Chapman and Sir Matt Busby: The Man Who Made a Football Club. The latter was shortlisted for the Cross Football Book of the Year at the Sports Book of the Year awards in 2017.“Such awful news. Paddy Barclay has died,” wrote the football journalist Philippe Auclair on Bluesky. “A super writer, a magnificent man, a friend of 30 years. How we will miss that smile.” Paying his own tribute, the Guardian’s chief sports writer, Barney Ronay, wrote: “So sad. He was very nice to me as a new person on the beat many years ago. Always remembered that. And always just so funny.”Manchester United also paid tribute to Barclay. “Paddy will always be held in great esteem by everyone at Manchester United and we send our sympathies to his loved ones at this time,” read a statement by the club. Everton and Fulham were among the other clubs to pay tribute to Barclay.Explore more on these topicsFootballnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m waiting’Manager confirms Manuel Akanji out for up to 10 weeksJamie JacksonFri 14 Feb 2025 17.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 17.34 ESTSharePep Guardiola has pointed to Liverpool being unable to beat Manchester City’s 100-point Premier League title triumph as an example of how many of his team’s records may never be beaten.Guardiola led City to a record points total in 2017-18. That was the first of City’s six championships under him, with last season’s fourth in succession also a record achievement.‘I wouldn’t swap him for anyone’: Eddie Howe happy to take Isak over HaalandRead moreGuardiola’s side are now 16 points behind Liverpool, with injuries a major factor in City’s uneven campaign. During Tuesday’s3-2 Champions League lossto Real Madrid, Jack Grealish and Manuel Akanji became the latest to suffer problems. While Grealish may recover from what is thought to be a muscle problem for Saturday’s visit of Newcastle, Akanji is to undergo surgery on an abductor injury and will be out for up to 10 weeks.Guardiola said that due to the accumulation of game-time for players, numerous injuries are inevitable, which in his opinion makes City’s supreme success under him more remarkable. “[Even] with that [injuries], we took all the records in England. Nobody has done four Premier Leagues in a row,” said Guardiola. “It’s different when you break your own record and say: ‘What’s next?’ We have all the records – had 100 points in a season. I said many times to the players, when I analyse the last nine years, we’ve had a really really bad three months. It’s not bad, no? People are saying: ‘What’s happened Pep?’ But what has happened in the past [under him]? That is not normal now, or in the past.“Who would do 100 points now? I’m waiting. Or four in a row, I’m waiting. Have you seen Liverpool this season? They cannot do 100 points already, definitely cannot – 99 but not 100.”Despite the injuries, Guardiola will take his strongest possible squad to June’s Club World Cup in the US. “It will be summer time there, we will go with the families, we will train when we have to train and prepare the games,” he said. “It is important for the club, financially and for the prestige. We will welcome people [youngsters] from the academy [too].“After we’ll see if I give extra time to some to arrive late [for pre-season] and maybe the first games of the Premier League or the first games of the season. We will see how they arrive [condition] and how many minutes some players play.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After his win, Littler – the world champion and defending Premier League champion – admitted his frustration at the “pretty bad” situation faced by the players.In response, world darts’ governing body has stressed action can be taken should the circumstances again go beyond expected reasonable behaviour.“Following Thursday’s Premier League Darts night in Glasgow, the PDC wishes to strongly reiterate that it does not condone any behaviour which can disrupt an event, such as whistling or booing when players are throwing,” the PDC said in a statement.“Every player goes on stage with the intention of performing to the best of their ability and providing an entertaining spectacle for all fans, whether in the venue or watching worldwide. As per the terms and conditions of entry to events, spectators who act inappropriately can be removed from the venue.“The PDC works closely with Premier League venues, who have responsibility for crowd control, to take proactive and decisive action against those who behave inappropriately.“The vast majority of fans who attend our sell-out events on a regular basis also condemn this behaviour and we will continue to promote a positive atmosphere which gives all players the opportunity to play to the best of their ability in every match.”The Premier League continues with night three in Dublin on 20 February. Humphries, who won the opening night in Belfast, leads the table with eight points. Littler is second with five, with Michael van Gerwen third on four points.Explore more on these topicsDartsLuke LittlerScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

It has a rich sports history and a rich cricketing history, and it’s supported by passionate fans. Old Trafford itself is a landmark. The rich legacy of the Lancashire CountyCricketClub is unparalleled. So in a nutshell, the Manchester Originals is hugely attractive.”Was he worried about the Manchester rain washing out games in a time of weather extremes. “I have not thought about that per se, and the weather gods are not in our hands, so …”The deal gives Lancashire a payday in excess of £25m plus 3% of the new TV deal to come in 2029.

She stopped the Bruins’ 10-0 run with a three-pointer that kept the Trojans ahead 38-35 at the half.It was her second-highest scoring game of the season, just two points shy of her 40-point effort against California Baptist on 3 December.“I wear #12 to be like JuJu,” read a sign held by a youngster.So did the predominantly cardinal-clad crowd that was diverse in its age, gender and racial makeup, a testament to Watkins’ drawing power and the support she enjoys from the nearby Watts community where she grew up.The stars were out on the rainy night, too.Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers wore a JuJu T-shirt. Watkins spotted actors Kevin Hart and Issa Rae, along with singer Monica.“When you have people like that show up you can’t disappoint,” Watkins said. “I’m really just like a kid out there and just living out my dreams.”She was coming off a nightmarish stretch, having shot 12 of 45 from the floor in her last two home games. She was just 4 of 25 from 3-point range in that span, too.“It has been a tough couple weeks for me,” she said. “There’s a lesson in everything and I think that is to always stay joyful on the court.”Watkins hit 6 of 9 three-pointers and 8 of 10 free throws to go with 11 rebounds, eight blocks and five assists.“I didn’t plan on having that many blocks but that’s what we needed to win,” she said.View image in fullscreenUSC’s JuJu Watkins and UCLA’s Londynn Jones battle for a loose ball in the second quarter at the Galen Center on Thursday night.Photograph: Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesTypically cool with a demeanor that gives away nothing, Watkins was energized from the start, winning the opening tipoff. She missed her first shot, but quickly hit a three, one of her three in the first quarter.USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb relished her superstar’s response to the recent tough times, saying, “JuJu’s just heroic shot-making and effort and intensity, especially coming with the million questions she gets when it’s not perfect out there.”Fans were on their feet in the closing minutes, creating the kind of raucous atmosphere that keeps growing in Watkins’ second year. NFL rookie of the year Jayden Daniels, Kelsey Plum and Dearica Hamby of the LA Sparks, and Vanessa Bryant and daughter Natalia were also in the crowd cheering her on.“This is a historic Galen [Center] performance,” Gottlieb said.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

He attended the summit with other global leaders, including the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, the Canadian PM, Justin Trudeau, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.In his speech in the Grand Palais, Vance made it clear the US was not going to be held back from developing the tech by global regulation or an excessive focus on safety.“We need international regulatory regimes that foster the creation of AI technology rather than strangle it, and we need our European friends, in particular, to look to this new frontier with optimism rather than trepidation,” he said.China was also challenged. Speaking in front of the country’s vice-premier, Zhang Guoqing, Vance warned his peers against cooperating with “authoritarian” regimes – in a clear reference to Beijing.“Some of us in this room have learned from experience partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure,” he said.Delivered weeks after China’s DeepSeek rattled US investors with its powerful new model, Vance’s speech made it clear that America was determined to remain the global leader in AI.2.Going it aloneUnsurprisingly given Vance’s exceptionalism, the USdeclined to sign the diplomatic declarationon “inclusive and sustainable” AI published at the end of the summit. But the UK, a major player in AI development, also refused, stating that the document had not gone far enough in addressing global governance of AI and the technology’s impact on national security.The failure to achieve consensus over a seemingly uncontroversial document, makes achieving meaningful global governance of AI appear an even more distant prospect. The first summit, at Bletchley Park in the UK in 2023, at leastachieved an agreementbetween major nations and tech firms over AI testing – albeit on a voluntary basis.Gatherings at Bletchley and Seoul a year later had achieved careful agreement, yet signs this wouldn’t happen at the third gathering were already clear on the opening night. In his welcoming speech,Macron pushed the casefor investors and tech companies to view France and Europe as AI hubs, while throwing shade at Donald Trump’s focus on fossil fuels.Referring to the vast energy consumption needed by AI, Macron said France stood out due to its reliance on nuclear energy.“I have a good friend on the other side of the ocean saying ‘drill, baby, drill.’ Here, there is no need to drill. It’s plug, baby, plug. Electricity is available,” he said. It confirmed an undertone of differing national outlooks – and competition – at the summit.Nonetheless Henry de Zoete, a former adviser on AI to Rishi Sunak in Downing Street, said the UK had “played a blinder”. “Not signing the statement brought vital good will with the Trump admin at little cost,” he wrote on X.3.Playing it safe?Safety,top of the agendaat the UK summit, was not at the forefront in Paris despite ongoing concerns.Yoshua Bengio, a world-renowned computer scientist and chair of amajor safety report released before the summit, told the Guardian in Paris that the world is not addressing the implications of highly intelligent AIs.“We have a mental block on the idea that there will be machines that are smarter than us,” he said.Sir Demis Hassabis, the head of Google’s AI unit, called for unity in dealing with AI after the lack of agreement over a declaration.“It’s incredibly important the international community continues to come together and discuss the future of AI. We all have to be on the same page about the future we’re working to create.”Pointing to potentially worrying scenarios such as powerful AI systems behaving deceptively, he added: “These concerns are not far-off or far-fetched, nor are they limited to one particular geography. They are global concerns that require focused, international cooperation.”Safety aside,some key themeswere given a prominent hearing at the summit. Macron’s AI envoy, Anne Bouverot, said the current environmental trajectory of AI was “unsustainable” while the general secretary of the UNI Global Union, Christy Hoffman, said AI could become an “engine of inequality” by driving productivity gains at the cost of workers’ welfare.4.Progress is acceleratingThere were many references to the pace of change. Hassabis said in Paris that artificial general intelligence – a theoretical term for AI systems that match or exceed humans at any intellectual task – was “only perhaps five years or something away”.Dario Amodei, chief executive of US AI company Anthropic, said that by 2026 or 2027 AI systems will be like a new country joining the world. It will be akin to “an entirely new state populated by highly intelligent people appearing on the global stage”.Urging governments to do more to measure the economic impact of AI, Amodei warned that the advanced AI could represent “the largest change to the global labour market in human history”.Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, flagged thestartup’s latest product, Deep Research, which was released at the beginning of the month. It is an AI agent – the term for a system that can carry out tasks on users’ behalf – and is powered by a version of OpenAI’s latest cutting-edge model, o3.Speaking at a fringe event, he said Deep Research could carry out a “low single-digit percentage of all the tasks in the economy in the world right now … which is a crazy statement.”5.China offers to helpDeepSeek’s founder,Liang Wenfeng, did not attend the Paris summit although there was no shortage of discussion of the startup’s achievements. Hassabis said DeepSeek was “probably the best work I’ve seen come out of China”. He added, however, that there was “no actual new scientific advance there”.Guoqing said China was willing to work with other countries to safeguard security and share achievements in AI to build “a community with a shared future for mankind”. One Chinese AI company in Paris, Zhipu, predicted AI systems achieving “consciousness” by 2030, adding to the number of claims at the conference that super-powerful AIs are round the corner.6.The shadow of MuskThe world’s richest person still managed to have an impact on events in Paris despite not attending. A consortium led by Elon Musklaunched a near-$100bn bidfor thenon-profit that controls OpenAI, triggering a flood of questions for Altman, who is trying to convert the startup into a for-profit business.Altman told reporters “the company is not for sale” and repeated a tongue-in-cheek counter offer: “We are happy to buy Twitter.”Asked about the future of OpenAI’s non-profit arm, which is supposed to be spun off as part of the overhaul while retaining a stake in the profit-making unit, he said: “The non-profit will survive as a very, very strong thing … and we are totally focused on making sure we preserve that.”In an interview with Bloomberg, Altman said Musk’s bid was probably an attempt to “slow us down.” He added: “Probably his whole life is from a position of insecurity – I feel for the guy.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverComputingFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronNarendra ModiJD Vancekey takeawaysShareReuse this content"

Moving from designing chips to making its own complete processor could also put Arm into competition with some of its biggest customers in the £500bn semiconductor industry.Arm declined to comment. Shares in the company rose by more than 6% on Thursday after the Financial Times reported on the plans.The Financial Times also reported that the launch of Arm’s own chip is one step in a larger plan by SoftBank’s founder Masayoshi Son to make more money from its own intellectual property by moving into AI chip production and building a vast infrastructure network for artificial intelligence.View image in fullscreenSoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son.Photograph: Koichi Mitsui/AFLO/Rex/ShutterstockLast month, Son unveiled his Stargate initiative with OpenAI, which will spend an estimated £400bn building AI infrastructure, with Abu Dhabi state fund MGX and Oracle also providing funding, and Arm as a key technology partner alongside Microsoft and Nvidia.Arm’s chip is expected to be a central processing unit (CPU) for servers in large datacentres and customisable for clients including Meta, according to those familiar with the plans. Production will be outsourced to a manufacturer such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, these people said.Another deal integral to Arm’s chipmaking project is Softbank’s expected acquisition of Ampere, an Oracle-backed chip designer of Arm-based chips for servers thatcould be valued at close to $6.5bn(£5.15bn).Cambridge-headquartered Arm has more than doubled in value to $173bn since it listed on the Nasdaq in 2023, buoyed by investor interest in AI. Arm had previously been listed in London, before Softbank took it over in 2016.Meta is the latest big tech company to turn to Arm for its power-efficient server chips instead of Intel and AMD, while Arm’s partnerships with Nvidia and Amazon have driven its rapid growth in the datacentres that power AI assistants from OpenAI, Meta and Anthropic.Explore more on these topicsArmTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

About 52% of its total downloads were from Apple’s App Store, while 48% were from Google Play in the US last year, Sensor Tower said.Is TikTok a national security threat – or is the ban a smokescreen for superpower rivalry?Read moreThe law that requires ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US assets or ultimately face a ban was signed by then president Joe Biden in April last year, triggered by national security concerns and fears that China could use the video-sharing app to spy on American users.The US has never banned a major social media platform and the law that passed last year gives the government sweeping authority to ban or seek the sale of other Chinese-owned apps.Trump said on Thursday that his 75-day deadline on TikTok could be extended.The turmoil at TikTok attracted several potential buyers, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50bn.Trump has said that he was in talks with multiple people over TikTok’s purchase and would likely have a decision on the app’s future in February.Explore more on these topicsTikTokAppleGooglenewsShareReuse this content"

Deel went on to work for Cisco, which is the number one supplier of corporate phones in the world, and used the tune.It went global.If a banger is defined as something that raises your blood pressure, then yeah, I define it as a bangerJonathan HomseyOpus No 1 is known globally for its place on the digital technology conglomerate Cisco’s hold playlist – and its part as the ambient backdrop for a 2023 Bud Light commercial. It has 2,288,086 plays and counting on Spotify.In 2018 Centrelink changed its tunes from a more classical selection that included Frédéric Chopin’s Waltz #3 in A Minor to have the synth melody of Opus No.1 on the playlist.“I thought that this was just the Centrelink song,” Kea said. “But it turns out that even people in Switzerland and Poland and like every other country have heard this song before.”While Australians aren’t alone, they are inspired. In 2023 artist Jonathan Homsey created a work for the Fringe festival where part of the audience stood in the Melbourne City Baths while a dancer performed a routine and the song reverberated across the pool.Lockdown acted as the muse.“I just wanted this communal experience to bring people back to that moment,” Homsey said. “I wasn’t the only one who was on hold while in the bathroom, on hold while brushing their teeth.“The music is the sound of purgatory.“I went through multiple lockdowns. The work [was] in cycles. So every 10 minutes I went back to dancing to the song as kind of a metaphor of, oh, here I am again.”Director at Music On Hold Australia, Jenny Crosby, said the winning formula of a good hold song is: a decent beat, consistent volume and can’t arouse too much emotion.Playing the radio, for instance, can upset listeners if they hear news they don’t like.“Honestly, if it was in the world of music generally, hold music would be very boring,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, the group took a series of unrelated detours into tangential areas like third-party ballot access, and its effort to uncover fraud reaffirmed what numerous studies, court rulings and bipartisan investigations have concluded: voter fraud is extremely rare.The lack of evidence has not stopped Republicans in Congress and state legislatures fromcontinuing to push restrictive voting lawsaimed at addressing this phantom threat. Meanwhile, Musk is claiming that “fraud” justifies his efforts to slash government operations, butsimilarly has not revealed much evidence.The Fair Election Fund has now gone radio silent. Sitemap data shows that the website has not been updated since October, and the X/Twitter account for the group has not posted since November. The group’sspokesperson, former representative Doug Collins, becameTrump’s veterans affairs secretary, and is now alsoleading the office of government ethics.Close ties to world’s richest manThe Fair Election Fund is a fictitious name for another 501(c)(4) non-profit, Documented can reveal, and operates within a network run by Musk’s top political advisers. The group received funding from the same dark-money vehicle Musk has used to channel his political spending, and alsorouted fundsto another Musk-backed non-profit.The group is housed within a non-profit now called Interstate Priorities, formerly known as the For Which It Stands Fund. Formed on 3 January 2023, the non-profitraised $8,226,000 from a single donation in 2023.The group is led by Victoria “Tori” Sachs, a Republican operative who was also executive director ofAnd to the Republic, a group also formed in January 2023 thatsupportedRon DeSantis’s presidential bid, including by funding DeSantis’sprivate jetsandhosting quasi-campaign events.The naming of the two Sachs-led groups – And to the Republic and the For Which It Stands Fund – and the timing of their creation in January 2023 suggests that the group that now houses the Fair Election Fund was originally intended to support DeSantis’s run, which Muskinitially supported.Sachs’s involvement continued through 2024, with her name appearing onrecordsthat accompanied the Fair Election Fund’s broadcast purchases.Since 2022, Musk has beensecretly channeling his political spendingthrough a dark-money non-profit called Building America’s Future. That group is run by Generra Peck and Phil Cox, two Republican operatives who were involved in DeSantis’s failed presidential bid andnow advise Musk.

Cox’s digital marketing firm IMGE LLC, whichprovides services to several groupsin the Musk-backed, Building America Future-tied universe,manages the Fair Election Fund’s Facebook page, and an IMGE employeeappears to be responsiblefor articles on the Fair Election Fund’s website.The Fair Election Fund/Interstate Priorities also acted as a conduit to support other Musk-backed groups. The group’s2023 tax returnshows that it made a $1,550,000 grant toCitizens for Sanity, whichMusk funded in 2022 through Building America’s Future, and which airedracist and transphobic adsthat election cycle. That grant made up almost the entirety of Citizens for Sanity’sfunding in 2023.In the 2024 election cycle, Musk publicly disclosed at least $277m in political contributions to Super Pacs that worked to elect President Trump and otherRepublicans. It is not known how much he may have given to other politically active groups that disguise their donors.A detour into third-party ballot accessThe Fair Election Fund’s goal of exposing election fraud seemingly turned up nothing of significance.Out of its $5m fund, the group announced $75,000 in “bounty” payments, releasing$50,000in July 2024 and$25,000in September 2024. The Fair Election Fundpromisedthat it would “highlight” the election fraud stories it gathered through these payments via “aggressive paid and earned media campaigns”, but it never did so, which suggests that none of the evidence generated was consequential or credible.Instead, the group took a detour in July 2024: it launched a$175,000ad“blitz” targeting North Carolina state board of election (NCSBE) members whodelayedplacing third-party presidential candidates Cornel West and Robert F Kennedy Jr on the ballot. At the time, Republicans and their allies believed that West and Kennedy wouldact as spoilers to help Trump, by siphoning left-leaning votes away from the Democratic presidential nominee.Ironically, the NCSBE had delayed a decision on West’s and Kennedy’s ballot eligibility based on evidence thatpetitions were obtained through fraudulent means– concerns that would seem to align with the Fair Election Fund’s stated mission of exposing election fraud.The Fair Election Fundadsdeclared that the Democratic members of the NCSBE were “blocking your voting rights”, and offered a reward for evidence of the members’ “shady backroom deal”. The group alsoprojected imageson the side of the NCSBE’s building, and drovemobile billboardsaround the agency’s headquarters.The Fair Election Fund also randigital adsin North Carolina featuring Black voters, some of which asserted that “African American voices are not being heard”, while others declared “Support Equality, Support Inclusion, Support [Cornel West’s] Justice for All Party”. The group pushed similar efforts in states such asMichigan.Democratic lawyer Marc Elias, who sought to keep West off of ballots in North Carolina and elsewhere, was a frequent target of the group. In October 2024, the groupannouncedthat it would be running a six-figure ad buy to “troll” Elias. The ads included mobile billboards around the Elias Law Group office as well as a full-page ad in the Washington Post, which declared: “We beat Marc Elias and his racist voter suppression lawsuits … He tried to disenfranchise tens of thousands of voters who support Cornel West, but the Fair Election Fund stopped him.”The Fair Election Fund then veered into a series of efforts to chase other trending rightwing conspiracy theories.For example, over the summer, the Fair Election Fund seized on to a far-fetched conspiracy theory about theonline fundraising platform ActBlue, claiming to have found “60,000 potential discrepancies” in ActBlue-facilitated contributions to the Biden-Harris campaign, based on an investigation conducted “from late July to early August”. The group claimed to have “spent $250,000on these initial findings” – a jaw-dropping sum to spend on a brief review of campaign finance records.The group then announced a $50,000 ad buy in several swing states soliciting evidence from people who claim to have been “defrauded by ActBlue”. No evidence from this “investigation” has been made public.In fall 2024, asconspiracy theories about noncitizen votinggained momentum, the Fair Election Fundannouncedthat it would belaunchinga “six-figure investigation into noncitizen voting in seven key swing states”. The results of this “six-figure investigation” were never made public.This article was produced in partnership withDocumented, an investigative watchdog and journalism project.

To make £1,000 a week a couple of years ago it took about 50 hours, he says, whereas now it’s about 70 hours – with most drivers needing to pay insurance, tax, vehicle fees and upkeep, fuel, licenses, rent, bills and living costs.Waite claims that, after the supreme court classed Uber drivers asentitled to workers’ rights such as holiday and sick pay in 2021, the company has reduced fares for drivers to make up the cost.To contest his working conditions, Waite will not be working for private hire driving apps between 4pm and 10pm on Valentine’s Day. He’s taking part in a log-off action against Uber, Bolt and Addison Lee, withdrawing his labour alongsidethousands of othersto demand better pay, rights and safety measures.Friday’s action has been organised by drivers for the three companies and is supported by the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB). “Drivers report that their conditions have only worsened following the [2021] ruling, since Uber responded to the forced introduction of rights by cutting its rates,” the IWGB says. About 200 drivers from cities across the country got in touch with the Guardian to share their views on the action.Waite, who is also signed up with Bolt, says Uber is a fantastic app which has “done so many amazing things for how people get around”. But he says declining pay has “reached a point where I can’t do it”. He’s considering leaving the job.The Valentine’s Day action will be “about raising awareness amongst drivers [and] building that momentum”, Waite says. “We power Uber, we power this system. If we’re united, we can actually make a change.”Another driver who plans to log off on Friday is Isaac Mohammed, 30, a part-time driver in Cardiff since 2016.“Uber used to be the best ride-sharing app, but over the past two years, things have changed drastically,” Mohammed says, adding that for some rides the rate can be less than £1 a mile – including holiday pay – whereas previously it was often £3 a mile.“Nowadays, having a takeaway for me is seen as a luxury,” he says. “It’s very hard to survive, unless you’re living in your car.”A core issue for Mohammed is what counts as working time. Uber calculates it from when a ride is accepted until the passenger exits, but he says this doesn’t account for time waiting for rides – which means the pay is effectively lower.Also taking part is Kieran Airey, a 36-year-old in Merseyside, who drives for Uber and a local private hire firm. He says he noticed in early 2024 it was taking longer to hit his target of £200 a day. That meant working around 55 to 60 hours a week, up from 45 hours. “At one point, I was working basically seven days a week,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘I just want fair pay for fair work,’ says Kieran Airey, 36.Photograph: Kieran Airey/Guardian CommunityHe found it harder to take his 14-year-old son to football, ate processed, microwavable meals rather than home-cooked dinners because of his increased fatigue and had to take weekend naps, so “I had enough energy to work that following night”.Airey says he’s frustrated by a lack of transparency about algorithms and payment structures. “I just want fair pay for fair work,” he says.‘It’s a nightmare’: couriers mystified by the algorithms that control their jobsRead moreUber denies claims drivers are unfairly paid. “Uber provides a national living wage guarantee to all drivers, topping up their earnings if they ever fall below that level, although most drivers can and do earn much more,” a spokesperson said.“All drivers are also paid holiday pay weekly as cash, which represents an additional 12% of their earnings paid out weekly,” drivers have “the freedom to work where and when they want” and “industry-leading rights”.An Addison Lee spokesperson said the company had “a close working relationship with our drivers” and does “not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels” on Friday. A spokesperson said Bolt is “committed to ensuring our prices balance the earning needs of drivers with affordability for passengers”, adding that “all drivers receive holiday pay and monetary supplements to ensure they earn at least the national living wage, alongside a pension”.Gavin, a 45-year-old driver for Uber and Bolt in Birmingham, says he sympathises with some concerns, but is not taking part in the action.“I really have to be grateful for Uber giving me this opportunity to earn a living being a private hire driver,” he says, adding that he enjoys the freedom of setting his own schedule – around children aged 17, 19 and 24 – and earns more than his previous job.But 54-year-old Martin Hayward in Southampton, a private hire driver for 20 years, is taking part and says the log-off action doesn’t go far enough to have an impact. “I’d happily log off for a week,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘I work seven days a week for less than £500,’ says Martin Hayward.Photograph: Martin Hayward/Guardian CommunityHe claims he could make around £750-a-week before October last year, but now gets about £450 for the same hours.“I work seven days a week for less than £500. I don’t have any social life,” he says. “The worst thing about being a driver is that you’re constantly taking people places where they’re going to have a nice time – the theatre, or on holiday, or on a trip, or a cruise. You’re just thinking … I can’t do any of these things.“It just floors you.”Explore more on these topicsGig economyUberValentine's DayfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That may sound like a grandiose comment, but it’s true. As a trilogy, the original games from 2007-2013 effortlessly plucked the most cerebral ideas from the sci-fi genre and slotted them into a memorable military role-playing game that had players invested from beginning to controversial end.Whether you prefer the hopeful, optimistic outlook of Asimov, the dark and reflective commentary of Shelley, the accessible thought experiments of Star Trek, or the arch melodrama of Battlestar Galactica, Mass Effect has it all. The trilogy is as happy grazing on the western-inspired tropes of Star Wars as the “hard” sci-fi of Iain M Banks, blending all its moods and micro-stories into a compelling, believable galaxy that somehow walks a line between breathless optimism and suffocating bleakness.Why Mass Effect is some of the best sci-fi ever madeRead moreMass Effect is special. And like any successful video game series, the achievement of the franchise rests on the shoulders of a huge assembly of developers. BioWare project director Casey Hudson and the studio’s co-founders, Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, get a lot of the credit, but so much of its soul comes from BioWare’s other creatives, too. The writing of Drew Karpyshyn, the art direction of Derek Watts, the vision of lead designer Preston Watamaniuk … and the soaring, cinematic music of Jack Wall.Every second you play you can feel the suffocating inevitability of sacrifice closing in around you. It needed music to match“I had made a soundtrack for Jade Empire very successfully with BioWare before Mass Effect,” Wall tells me, when I ask how he became part of the team working on the original title. “Then, they put out an audition process for what the team was calling SFX, the codename for Mass Effect. It was a blind audition, and BioWare got the files back from a number of composers. The team would listen to all those different things and decide who nailed it the most for the tone or the feeling they were picturing. And I won that audition blind.”Almost immediately, Casey Hudson got to work on giving Wall the brief. “His mandate was ‘I want this to sound like 80s sci-fi music’. No Star Wars, nothing like that, more like Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Blade Runner. Those were the main ideas.” Hudson specifically wanted to channel that vintage analogue synth sound that defined the science fiction of the era (especially in movies) and imagined the multilayered, multitextured approach from Tangerine Dream as the perfect accompaniment to the dense and complex Mass Effect universe.Wall explains that BioWare played him a piece of music written by another composer called Sam Hulick, who had also auditioned for the project. While Hulick wasn’t chosen to be the lead composer (because he was considered to be too junior for the job), Wall gave him equal credit on the soundtrack, thanks to his “incredibly important” contributions to key themes in the first game.It wasn’t until Mass Effect 2 that the music really came into its own, becoming integral to the whole experience. Where Mass Effect has this almost utopian outlook, channelling the optimism of mid-20th century sci-fi to establish its universe, the sequel is darker. The end of everything is nigh. From the off, you’re told the final act is a “Suicide Mission”, and to get your affairs in order before you reach the point of no return. There’s a pervasive pessimism, and every second you play you can feel the suffocating inevitability of sacrifice closing in around you. It needed music to match.“Right at the beginning of the development, Casey Hudson came in and said ‘I’d love to write the ending now’,” Wall says, “‘because everything’s going to culminate there. I want that to be the main moment that everyone remembers. He gave me some guidance, and talked me through what he wanted [players] to feel – which is always the best way to work with a director.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has a more orchestral bias than anything from the first game, and reflects the serious overall tone. It shows how rapidly Mass Effect matured from one game to the next.“It had to be epic, it had to feel cinematic, it had to feel ‘one man against everything’,” says Wall. “You needed to feel like you were saving the world, saving the galaxy, whatever. I came up with that main theme, and [Hudson] liked it pretty much immediately.”But before Wall and Hudson could start fitting the pieces together, there was some maintenance to be done. BioWare and Wall were unimpressed by how the music in the first game had been patched into the final product. “The transitions were terrible,” Wall says when I ask for examples, “and it just didn’t do justice to the music.“So, what we decided is that in Mass Effect 2, I would do all the implementation, which was something I’d never done before,” he continues. “I had an amazing assistant called Brian DiDomenico who worked with me in my studio every day; he sat in my vocal booth with a desk and aPC, and I would send him my tracks, he would implement them into the game, and I would do a play test there and then. And we would tweak it until it was really good … BioWare was known for only putting out a game when it was ready, and so things got delayed a lot, but fans were super happy when they got it.”Wall remembers finishing the game, noting that the whole ending sequence came through “in little tiny pieces of video that were spewed out by the game engine”. He took the files and fed them into a movie editor on his Mac, pieced the ending together, and edited Suicide Mission into it. He then wrote different endings to the track, reflecting the choices of the player.View image in fullscreen‘The end of everything is nigh’ … Mass Effect 2.Photograph: EA“It was the biggest mind-fucking thing I’ve ever done in my entire life,” he laughs. “And there was no one available to walk me through it, because they were all freaking out trying to finish the game. I handed it in, and they had to do a lot of massaging on their end in order to get it to work, but they did it … and the result is still one of the best ending sequences to a game that I’ve ever played. It was worth all that effort.”Wall did not return to score Mass Effect 3, the least well-received game in the trilogy. “Casey was not particularly happy with me at the end,” he says. “But I’m so proud of that score. It got nominated for a Bafta, and it did really well … [even if] it didn’t go as well as Casey wanted.” Talking to Wall, I sensing an almost Fleetwood Mac level of creative tension between him and Hudson; the duo made something amazing that would live in the hearts of sci-fi and RPG lovers for ever, but at the cost of some relationships.“Fallouts like that happen, it’s just part of the deal,” he says. “It’s one of the few times in my career that’s happened, and it was a tough time, but it is what it is.”Mass Effect 2’s final mission can be survived. If you make all the right choices, and execute the plan with absolute lucidity and determination, you can save your main character and all of the crew as they stare certain death in the eye. But the much more likely result, at least for most players, is that you lose at least one member of the team. This ragtag bunch of heroes becomes splintered, and limps into the climax of the series wounded, demoralised and desperate. To me, it’s a reflection of the brutal reality that good sci-fi reveals – a dramatic, honest look at the best and worst of human nature.Mass Effect Legendary Edition, which includes Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2, is available now on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.Explore more on these topicsGamesHigh scoresXbox series S/XPlayStation 5PCinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus, letters fromRoger FosterandDavid BaughFri 14 Feb 2025 13.22 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 13.23 ESTShareIt is good to read of Sundus Abdi’s renunciation of digital photography as a means to capture the personal and ephemeral aspects of her photographic life (The one change that worked: I began a quiet, satisfying rebellion against the digital age, 10 February). Photography with a smartphone has much to answer for the disposable image, often captured in an instant with little attention.In contrast, analogue photography, as she states, demands time, patience and thought. It also requires an investment in film and processing, knowing there are only 36 exposures on a roll of 35mm film. It has been hugely encouraging to discover a rise in the number of film-processing laboratories around Britain, which are clearly answering a need. Also, there are now many more new exciting film emulsions on the market.Digital imaging memory hardware is no match for the photographic scrapbook, which does not require a battery or power supply. Hard-copy prints take on their own existence as part of a continuing historical narrative; something that future historians and librarians will, I’m sure, be thankful for. I wish Sundus Abdi much joy in being part of this ongoing story.Julius SmitEastbourne, East SussexI experienced a moment of joy and recognition on reading Sundus’s account. Last year, I decided to give this a try. My refurbished 1970s vintage SLR camera has more than satisfied my inspiration; Sundus is right about the anticipation that comes with the wait for developed pictures, and I’ve also enjoyed learning techniques to improve my results. Every picture is a carefully planned and considered composition, and a learning experience – everything that digital snaps are not. My only concession to digitalisation is a light meter app.David R FrekeLondonThis article brought back many happy childhood memories of the anticipation of having mybox browniefilms developed by the local chemist. The thrill of seeing the successful prints, offset by the not infrequent disappointment of seeing a blank or grainy print, with its attached advisory sticker.In this increasingly digital age, the traditional family photo album will be a thing of the past. Accessing images stored in a cloud is soulless exercise compared with leafing through a photo album and sharing the memories, however imperfect the pictures may be. Undoubtedly the technology behind all things digital is extremely clever, but with the rapid growth and reliance on apps, we are creating a society that is similarly all image but sadly unreal.As it always has been, the choice of how we use technology is ours. Let’s hope for all our sakes we choose wisely.Roger FosterRipley, DerbyshireI read this with real interest because I, too, still use a film camera. The deferral of seeing the result adds to the anticipation and is a throwback to days before instant gratification. Because of this, each picture requires some consideration prior to releasing the shutter, but this can improve your powers of observation. Also, prints that you can hold are far nicer to view and can easily be kept in albums. The simple pleasure of discovering a stash of old photographs is going to become a lot rarer for future generations, which is a shame.Finally, I also admit to really liking black-and-white photography. I particularly like the effect that it can add to all manner of subjects. It is also easy to develop and print yourself, but now I’m probably entering into nerd territory.David BaughSwanage, DorsetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But sometimes we should pause to celebrate – to feel genuine awe – at the wonders that we have seen. Amid all the wars, the disasters and the crimes of the last half century, we have witnessed nothing short of a miracle.Vaccination, in addition to clean water, sanitation and improved nutrition, has been one of the greatest contributors to global health. It is responsible for much of the astounding fall in child mortality, which plummeted by 59% between 1990 and 2022. It has saved more than 150 million lives, mostly of infants,sincethe Expanded Programme on Immunisation was launched by the World Health Organization in 1974. Initially designed to protect children against diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, polio and measles, the scheme has since been extended to cover more pathogens. Then, in 2000, came the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), a public-private organisation that provides financial and technical support for vaccination in poorer countries and negotiates with manufacturers to lower costs.The results have been remarkable. Prevention is better – and cheaper and easier – than cure. Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980. Almost all the worldis now polio-free. Cases of many other diseases have been slashed. Much more can be done: an estimated 5 million children have beenprotected against malariasince routine vaccinations were launched a year ago. And from a scientific perspective, we are enteringa golden age of vaccines.Yet this is a dangerous moment in other ways. The climate crisis is spurring disease outbreaks. Conflict has dramatically increasedthe number of unprotected children. Vaccinescepticismhas grown. Now cuts to funding threaten to turn the clock back. The trashing of USAid will hinder delivery and hashalted a groundbreaking programmeto create new malaria vaccines. Robert F Kennedy Jr – who once claimed that “no vaccine is safe and effective” and who tried to persuade the US government to rescind authorisation for the coronavirus vaccine at the height of the pandemic – wasconfirmedthis week as health secretary.Now the UK, one of Gavi’s founding donors and the country which has given most to its core programme, is consideringa significant cut to its support. This would be a grave error. While some aspects of Gavi’s approach have faced sensible scrutiny in the past, it has vaccinated over 1 billion children and done so cost-effectively: 97 pence in every pound it is given goes on vaccine programmes. Its success is also evident in the number of countries which have graduated from being beneficiaries to paying their own way; some, including Indonesia, are becoming donors in turn. And Gavi’s stockpiles help to keep people safe in wealthier countries too, as well as ensuring that poorer nations are healthier and more stable.For all these reasons, Gavi has long enjoyed bipartisan support in the UK, which has given it more than £2bn over the last four years. Now, more than ever, its funding must be sustained. The world is full of apparently intractable conflicts and complex moral dilemmas. Few decisions are truly simple for governments. But this one is a no-brainer. It should astonish us that we can so easily save lives. It should be self-evident that we must continue to seize that opportunity.Explore more on these topicsVaccines and immunisationOpinionHealthWorld Health OrganizationChildrenClimate crisisUSAidUS politicseditorialsShareReuse this content"

Support unionsEric BlancOrganized labor could be Trump’s kryptoniteFri 14 Feb 2025 08.50 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 10.30 ESTShareCan anybody stop Trumpism? Progressives are understandably worried. Though federal judges may temporarily pause some of the new administration’s most brazenly illegal executive orders, a hyper-conservative supreme court lies waiting in the wings. And looking ahead to 2028, it’s hard to feel hopeful about defeating Maga given that the Democratic party continues to hemorrhage working-class voters.But there’s no need to despair. A powerful force in our society has the legitimacy, resources and leverage to turn things around: organized labor.Unionscan beat backDonald Trump’s attacks, expose his sham populism, and – by uniting workers around their shared economic interests – help isolate his xenophobic scapegoating.Rather than hibernate for the next four years, or limit ourselves to posting online about the president’s latest outrages, each of us can lend support to workers organizing at federal agencies, schools, Starbucks, Amazon, auto plants and beyond. Just as importantly, we can expand the labor movement’s reach byunionizing our own workplaces. It won’t be easy to counter Trump’s shock-and-awe offensive, or to fill the void left by theDemocrats’ disarray. But it’s both necessary andpossible.Trump’s neofascism is here now. Here are 10 things you can do to resist | Robert ReichRead moreConsider Trump’s latest moves. While he can appoint his cronies to head crucial civil service agencies, it is still unionized federal employees who make these institutions run. And their resistance to his power grab – through defying the new administration and enlisting public support – constitutes our best hope for protecting these services upon which millions of Americans depend.Remember the government shutdown during the first Trump administration? By late January 2019, the crisis had already lasted a month, with no end in sight. But then the flight attendant leaderSara Nelsonbegan making national waves by agitating for a general strike, stressing the public safety dangers of not paying the people whose labor makes air travel possible. On 25 January, various air traffic controllers refused to come into work, resulting in a temporary grounding of New York flights. Only a few hours later, Trump announced a deal to end the shutdown.The administration’s connection to the world’s richest men – Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg – makes it easier for anti-Trump sentiment to channel into workplace battlesResisting Maga’s barrage is crucial. But it would be a mistake to fight only on the right’s chosen political terrain. Trump’s achilles heel is that he won by speaking to the economic grievances of working people, but heads an administration of and for billionaires obsessed with maximizing their own profits and control. Centrist Democrats have generally been unable to expose this contradiction, as they too are often tied to big business. But combating corporate greed is the labor movement’s bread and butter, which is why unions in our era of rampant inequality are experiencing record-high levels of popularity, even among conservatives and independents.The administration’s connection to theworld’s richest men– Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg – makes it easier for anti-Trump sentiment to channel into workplace battles. When Tesla factory workers unionize, or coders at X push back against their boss, this is now de facto a confrontation with the White House. By scaling up high-publicity union drives and strikes for economic dignity across the country, labor and its supporters can force politicians to show which side they’re really on.Even labor struggles focused on economic issues can have dramatic political repercussions. Faced with Trump’s efforts to deprive workers of the right to unionize by kneecapping the National Labor Relations Board, every union drive is now on a collision course with the new regime. Moreover, since workplaces bring together people from a wide range of backgrounds and ideologies, union organizing requires listening to and persuading people who disagree with us, a skill sorely lacking among most progressives today. Effective persuasion happens not by haranguing or shaming others, but rather by finding points of commonality – often economic – around which working people can come together.Through this patient process of building solidarity across differences, labor organizing is uniquely positioned to convince large numbers of Americans to direct their anger at the bosses above (and their political proxies), instead of immigrants or trans people.Unsurprisingly, union members voted for Kamala Harris by a16-point marginin the last election; indeed, Trump would probably have lost had the US labor movement represented a significantly higher percent of the American workforce.Despite Trump’s constriction of labor rights, conditions overall remainfavorablefor union growth. Organized labor, for example, issitting onan unprecedented war chest of roughly $38bn in assets, over a third of which are highly liquid. This is more than enough to defend againstProject 2025while simultaneously going on the offensive against corporate America. Big, assertive unionization battles could lay bare Trump’s oligarchic allegiances, while pressuring Democratic politicians to champion economic populism.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Most remain exceedingly risk averse, narrowly focused, and deferential to establishment politicians. For that reason, labor’s post-pandemic upsurge has been driven from below, with young, left-leaning workers taking the lead – most recently at theWhole Foodsin Philadelphia that voted for a union last Monday. But to scale up widely enough to transform the US, this grassroots uptick will need deep-pocketed labor leaders to fully jump into the fight.It remains to be seen whether unions can rise to the challenge of Trumpism. For the sake of our democracy, our livelihoods, and our planet, let’s hope they do.What’s giving me hope nowWhat’s giving me hope is that PhiladelphiaWhole Foodsworkers last Monday voted to unionize, 130 to 100. It’s a really big deal: this was only the second time American workers have defeated Amazon in a union election. Many in the labor movement were expecting a loss, since Maga is now in office and since management – headed by Trump’s new billionaire buddy Bezos – went scorched earth against the nascent union effort. But a multiracial crew of young, self-organized, left-leaning workers proved the skeptics wrong, as so often has been the case since 2021. Labor passed its first big test under Trump, and hopefully we’ll see many similar wins in the months to come.Eric Blanc is the author of We Are the Union: How Worker-to-Worker Organizing is Revitalizing Labor and Winning Big, which is out with UC Press in February 2025Explore more on these topicsUS unionsFighting BackUS politicsDonald TrumpElon MuskJeff BezosWhole FoodsAmazoncommentShareReuse this content"

Even though we’re paying for 100% renewable energy, I still feel guilty.Avoid AI and catch a bus: Guardian readers share their top climate goals for 2025Read moreWe put off using the air-con for as long as possible, first by turning on the overhead fans we’ve installed in every room. Fans don’t lower the temperature, but extra air flow makes a roomfeelabout 3C cooler. Fans are cheap to run and, when combined with air-con, cut the energy needed for cooling.We also lower the blinds. Up to87% of a home’s heatis gained through windows, and every square metre of glass hit by direct sun can generate as much heat asa single bar radiator.Unfortunately, our blinds are black and absorb more heat than they repel. Our next investment will be blinds with a thin coating of reflective aluminium. The suppliers say they can reduce temperatures by up to 8C compared to rooms without window coverings.Aluminium may beat back the heat when it’s bonded to a blind, but in other settings it acts as a super conductor. Our windows are double-glazed but the aluminium frames radiate like hotplates.This could have been avoided by installing a gasket.“The gasket provides a thermal break so the inside and outside of the frames operate at different temperatures,” explains the architect Jeremy McLeod, founder of Breathe Architectureand Nightingale Housing, who has been designing buildings that score at least 7.5 on theNatHERS energy rating scalesince 2015.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailOur tower block was constructed in the 1990s, so perhaps the builders can be excused for not insulating the window frames, but McLeod reckons thermal breaks should now be standard in any new apartment. The additional cost is quickly recouped in energy savings and is falling fast as these frames become more common.Ideally, we should use external shades to prevent the sun hitting our apartment windows in the first place.But Melbourne is a windy city, and the higher up you go, the stronger the wind gets. “There’s a lot of nervousness about fixing a shade sail to a tall building,” McLeod says.Good engineering and sensors that retract the blinds in high winds might overcome this challenge, but building rules prevent us modifying the outside of the building. The rules can only be changed at an AGM or by special resolution, with the support of 75% of lot owners.As homeowners, we at least have the right to make changes inside our apartment. Renters must resort to temporary fixes, such asdouble glazing with bubble wrap, or using cardboard to shield windows when temperatures climb.Emma Bacon is the founding director of Sweltering Cities, which this month convened Australia’s firstExtreme Heat Awareness Day. She warns that climate change makes heatwaves more dangerous, but the impact is not equally shared, since renters are more likely to live in poorly built homes without insulation or air-con.Then there’s location to consider. “Lower income suburbs have a higher heat island effect,” says Bacon. “The hotter your suburb is, the poorer it’s likely to be,” she says.“Putting trees on a street can reduce the urban heat island effect by several degrees. And if your street is 3C cooler then your home will be 3C cooler too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last year, the bar wasraised to seven stars, but some states aredragging their feeton complying. And Bacon says the scale is out of date because it’s calibrated to historical climate data rather than today’s hotter summers.She identifies crucial things to look out for when considering building or buying a house in a suburban growth area.“The first is simple commonsense measures, such as the colour of the roof or whether there is any space around the house for planting trees,” she says.Research shows thatlighter coloured roofscan save households almost $700 a year in energy costs.Another is the direction a house faces, which affects how hot or cold it gets.Then there is energy efficiency, such as good insulation, deep eaves for shade, solar panels and double- or triple-glazed windows.Bacon says getting a home to beat the heat can mean pushing developers hard.“The priorities of the building industry are not necessarily to inform customers what it might be like to live in the house in terms of thermal comfort or energy efficiency.”While acknowledging that housing is already too expensive, Bacon thinks trading off thermal comfort for affordability is a false economy.“Without good thermal efficiency and high design standards the more expensive housing will become, not just for the households paying high energy bills but for all of us through higher carbon emissions.“There are so many choices that are much easier to make at the point of building rather than retrofitting.”That’s something I reflect on every time I switch on the air-con.Explore more on these topicsHousingChange by degreesAustralia weatherClimate crisisArchitecturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Captain of the Matildas, she became a household name – and the inspiration for children across Australia – as she led her team to victories during the 2023 Women’s World Cup.She is a well-loved and well-resourced woman of colour at the peak of her career. Yet despite all of this, she was stripped of her agency by authority and dragged through the courts in a case that should never have proceeded.Imagine how this plays out for the thousands of women of colour who don’t have Kerr’s platform, financial resources or legal support. Many wouldn’t have had the means to fight back. Many wouldn’t have been believed.From the moment the allegations against Kerr surfaced, public scrutiny here and in the UK was quick and in many cases unforgiving. She was called aggressive, racist and her actions immediately criticised without context or understanding. But history shows us that men in sport – and society – are given far more leeway. We’ve seen male athletes do far worse, yet they are granted second, third and even fourth chances. Kerr was put on trial.Men are more likely to be allowed to make mistakes. Women – especially women of colour and women who don’t conform to passive, demure stereotypes, who do not bow their head meekly and apologise – are often punished. And, as many commentators have previously noted, it is far harder for women to recover from public shaming than men.Sam Kerr will not face disciplinary action at Chelsea as coach says apology ‘enough’Read moreIn Australia, the more you fit into what society sees as “white”, the closer you are to power – and with this proximity to power you’re assumed to be credible, respectable, and deserving of protection. The further away, the more likely you are to be questioned, scrutinised and disbelieved.This case exposes just how little racial literacy exists in public discussion, and how important this kind of learning is in institutions. In Australia, we see this in the ongoing targeting of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who face disproportionate rates of incarceration and harm within our legal system, and how Indigenous women are also often misidentified as perpetrators of family violence.We need a deeper understanding of how gender and race go together to create injustice in legal systems. The commission’s proposed National Anti-Racism Framework focuses on the importance of understanding how different forms of discrimination overlap. It would improve education about race and racism, and ensure police receive proper anti-racism training.This case played out in the UK but the broader issues are equally relevant in Australia: it showed example after example of systemic racism and sexism: Kerr being patronised as “little missy” while a white man in power failed to recognise his privilege; two queer women corroborating each other’s testimony and yet their voices being dismissed in favour of one man’s. No acknowledgment of the fear experienced being locked in a car by a man – despite the very real threats these situations pose for women.We know that women’s experiences, especially women of colour or queer women, are routinely ignored or minimised by legal systems. Kerr – by her own admission – did not handle the situation well. But would she have been charged if she were a man? Or white? Or straight?Women already face so many legal barriers when it comes to speaking up against discrimination or violence. Statistics show that women do not report violence against them, partly because they don’t trust how the system will deal with them.It forces us to ask who really has access to justice in systems which still centre white men’s experience.In the end, credit must go to the jury – a diverse group of everyday people who heard the evidence and found her not guilty. This case is a reminder of the importance of juries that reflect the real world, rather than systems of power designed to uphold privilege.Power and privilege shape who is believed, who is punished and who gets justice. Until we dismantle these systemic inequalities, cases like this will continue to happen – not just to high-profile women of colour like Kerr, but to those whose voices are rarely, if ever, heard.Dr Anna Cody is Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner and Giridharan Sivaraman is Australia’s race discrimination commissionerExplore more on these topicsSam KerrOpinionRaceGendercommentShareReuse this content"

And it could be brilliantly transformative for EnglandFri 14 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 10.45 ESTShareLast week saw the launch of what could be – if done right – the most important political policy in a generation. You may not have heard about the newland use framework, but if you did hear something, chances are it wasn’t good. “National suicide!” declared the shadow farming minister, Robbie Moore, who described the policy for good measure as “food lunacy”.I should confess that I am the original author of this lunacy. It was one of the key recommendations of the 2021National Food Strategy– an independent review I was commissioned to write by the then Tory government. The purpose of the land use framework was – is – sane enough. It is intended to inform and streamline planning decisions and steer other government incentives, to ensure that areas of land are used in ways they are naturally well suited to.It will be, in essence, a map: one that contains multiple levels of data about the natural and human geography of England. Anyone – planning official, farmer, developer, householder, renter or merely interested citizen – will be able to use this map. By clicking on a given area, you’ll be able to access detailed information on, for example, local soil health, agricultural productivity, the risk of flooding or drought, carbon sequestration potential, biodiversity, land ownership and tenure, planning records and infrastructure suitability, water resources and pollution levels, or economic land use trends.Land use plan for England to map best areas for farming and natureRead moreA huge amount of this information already exists, but it is squirrelled away in discrete and inaccessible pockets of local or national government. Bringing it together in one place like this will, for the first time, enable every English citizen to get high-quality data about the land they live on, and its potential uses. It will also be – astonishingly – the first time every government department has had access to the same data.And this brings us to its second purpose. The data will be used to better inform and align government policy, across all departments, at a time when using our land wisely matters more than ever.For most of human history, everything we needed – water, food, trees to burn or build with – was on the surface of the Earth, created by the direct action of sunlight on land and sea. Then we discovered millions of years of stored sunlight buried deep underground, in the form of coal, gas and oil. For the past two centuries, cheap energy, synthetic materials and industrial agriculture have driven an unprecedented expansion of human prosperity, and population.But we can no longer afford this dependence on fossil fuels. The climate crisis, geopolitical instability, and the depletion of easily accessible fuel reserves mean we must once again turn to the land to meet our needs. Not only for food and housing, but also for cheap, secure, sustainable energy. We need to grow trees to soak up some of the carbon we have already released into the atmosphere. And we need to reverse the collapse in biodiversity, before it threatens our own survival. Without pollinators or healthy soil micro-organisms, we won’t be able to grow enough food to feed ourselves.All this makes it vital that we use every area of land cleverly, maximising its natural potential. The English landscape is wonderful in its variety: a mosaic of rolling hills, flat fenlands, chalk downs, limestone dales, peat bogs and wetlands, not to mention our huge urban conurbations. Different landscapes are suited to different uses. For example, there is no point building solar farms or housing estates on fertile land that would be ideally suited to farming. Likewise, there are areas of land that are too rugged or infertile to make farming productive. But existing farmers in these areas can’t be expected to diversify into, say, restoring biodiversity or eco-tourism if they can’t get planning permission to convert barns into leisure facilities.The need for joined-up thinking is both obvious and urgent. The Tories began work on the land use framework before the last election, andLabourhas picked up where they left off. Such rare continuity is reminiscent of the 2010 coalition government’s embrace of Labour’s education reforms: an attempt to set aside ideological flip-flopping and do the right thing for the country.Contrary to Moore’s nightmares, this is not some radical leftwing plot to dictate what farmers must do with their land. It is an attempt to bring coherence to land use decisions, which are currently fragmented across multiple government departments, leading to contradictory policies, sclerotic planning processes and widespread inefficiency. At a time when funds are limited, it also makes sense to ensure that agricultural grants and other government incentives are based on the best, most granular information.Land use plan for England to map best areas for farming and natureRead moreThe problem is that this policy has been launched into the febrile atmosphere caused by the mishandledinheritance tax changesfor farmers. This has created huge uncertainty and anger, with many farmers afraid that they won’t be able to pass their farms on to the next generation. Given the relatively small amount of money this measure is expected to raise, it is hard to justify the level of anxiety and political backlash it has caused.People are spooked, so they are seeing monsters everywhere. But the land use framework is not a Stalinist five-year plan. It won’t force landowners to do anything. It will merely create better information and wiser incentives, enabling farmers to make more profitable and sustainable choices about how to use their land. Done right, it should also improve and speed up planning decisions,making it easier for farmers to build new agricultural buildings, renewable energy projects or tourism and leisure facilities. In short, it creates a smarter, more joined-up approach to land management, rather than imposing top-down diktats.This is a moment for pragmatism, not polarisation. The land use framework could be the most important reimagining of how we use our land since the second world war. Back then, the question was stark: how do we feed ourselves in the face of the U-boat threat? Today, the challenge is just as existential: how do we feed ourselves in the face of climate and biodiversity collapse, while boosting economic growth and using the land we have wisely?Without this framework, we will remain mired in contradictory regulations, tangled bureaucracy and reactive decision-making, all of which fail to address our long-term challenges. Success will depend on collaboration, evidence-based policy and long-term cross-party commitment–not political point-scoring. We have to get this right, to secure a sustainable, prosperous future for generations to come.Henry Dimbleby is managing partner of Bramble Partners, which invests in and advises businesses that are creating a sustainable food systemExplore more on these topicsFarmingOpinionRural affairsPlanning policyLabourGreen politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Campaigners try to create an impression that the herd is moving their way, hoping to set off a stampede. “‘Chaotic’ assisted dying bill at risk over High Court U-turn”, goesone headlinethis week. But as the assisted dying bill makes its slow way through detailed scrutiny in Kim Leadbeater’s committee, it’s not happening. Only in the pages of the Tory press are MPs stampeding: actual MPs seem to be moving little, and if anything in favour, according to the campaign group Dignity in Dying. The vote at second reading was won by 55.Leadbeater’s amendment to replace a high court judge’s approval for an assisted death with a panel of three professionals – a psychiatrist, social worker and lawyer – set off an avalanche of claims that this was tipping the vote against her. Here’s the Mail’s headline:“Social workers to sit on ‘death panels’ in Labour MP’s watered-down assisted dying bill”. Social workers! According to the Mail’s story, MPs who had previously backed the bill “said they were now thinking again amid an angry backlash”. The Times quoted10 Labour MPs signing a protest, without mentioning that these 10 MPs were always against assisted dying.The Times has been relentless. According to one of its reports, medical experts have warned that amendments to the bill could be a “slippery slope” – the experts being, of course, those who were always anti-assisted dying. Leadbeater’s amendment is due to practical evidence from the likes of the former supreme court justice Jonathan Sumption that high court judges in an overwhelmed court system couldn’t take this on. Nicholas Mostyn, a former high court judge, gave evidence that the bill “would not fly at all” without “enough judges to go around”. The justice ministry requested this change, though the justice secretary,Shabana Mahmood, opposed it. The former president of the supreme court Brenda Hale gets much coverage for suggesting a district or circuit judge could take this on, but as a prominent supporter of assisted dying, she told theFinancial Timesthat she didn’t think “the proposed panel is necessarily a bad thing”.Rather less coverage goes to her support for an amendment,backed by Humanists UK(of which I am vice-president), that extends eligibility for assisted dying to 12 months before death, not six months, to allow for those with neurological conditions such as motor neurone disease or Huntington’s.Amendment 234, which is highly unlikely to pass, lays the ground for a future extension. Most people travelling to die at Dignitas in Switzerland have longer thansix monthsto live. Polling for Humanists UK shows amajority of voterssupport there being no time limits for those with degenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, by 73% to 9% against.This is just one of more than 350 proposed amendments to the bill. Many of these seem intended to gum up proceedings, so when the committee ends by mid-April opponents can protest that too many amendments went undebated. All kinds of angles and wrangles are in play. How about this indignationfrom the Telegraph: “Depressed people who are terminally ill could be eligible for assisted dying.” Some, who are dying in pain and seek a quicker death, may indeed be depressed. But if that disqualifies them, it’s a catch-22. Should only the cheerful be qualified to end their lives?The well-financed but opaque campaign Care Not Killing has put out a tidal wave of online messages to postcode-targeted voters featuring apicture of their local MP. They feature the following message: “Breaking News. MP ‘watering down’ assisted dying protections. Your MP must reconsider their position.” Typical is one sent to abstainer Chris Bryant’s voters, which cost the campaign in the region of £500 to be seen up to 15,000 times on a screen. Will MPs take fright? I’d imagine not: the polls for years have been strongly in favour of assisted dying. YouGov’s tracker holds steady, with68% of the publicsupporting assisted dying. Others are even higher.The Labour MP Lewis Atkinson, a Leadbeater supporter who sits on the bill committee, has been subjected to such ads, along with a prolific religiously organised write-in. Opponents on the committee, he told me, are trying to kill the bill with delays: the committee spent 10 hours over the first two days of this week discussing one clause. When some near-identical amendment was refused, Danny Kruger, a committee member and lead opponent of assisted dying,tweeted outthat the committee has refused to exclude people with impaired judgment or those “unduly influenced” by others.Atkinson said this was nonsense, explaining that an amendment using the word “manipulated” might not be selected over another near-identical one using the proper legal term “coerced”. . But they can claim the bill’s proponents rejected the idea of manipulation. He fears they will run the committee out of time, and then claim that the debate was stifled. The argument made by theUK’s highest-ranking Catholic bishop, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who claimed that MPs spent “more than a hundred times longer debating foxhunting than assisted dying”, will certainly not be the case. The religious have a considerable army behind them, but mostly they are not as honest about their God-driven reasons for opposing the bill as the single campaigner I spotted recently in Westminster with a placard reading “Suicide is self-murder. Don’t go to hell.”The point of a bill committee is to take screeds of evidence in order to improve it. But you can expect any change to the bill to be greeted by sham indignation from those who have always been opposed to it. The last word goes to the Express, the bill’s unexpected sole champion in the rightwing media. Headlined “Plotters against assisted dying bill must not win”, it concludes “the wreckers within Westminster should know that millions of people will be outraged if this vital reform is delayed. We will not give up this fight.” It only takes 28 MPs to change their mind for the bill to fail.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 14 February 2025. An earlier version incorrectly described Jonathan Sumption as a “former chief justice”; he is a former supreme court justice.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingOpinionNewspapersReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

Both camps issued dire warningsFri 14 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 08.27 ESTShareIwas a technophile in my early teenage days, sometimes wishing that I had been born in 2090, rather than 1990, so that I could see all the incredible technology of the future. Lately, though, I’ve become far more sceptical about whether the technology that we interact with most is really serving us – or whether we are serving it.So when I got an invitation to attend a conference on developingsafe and ethical AIin the lead-up to theParis AI summit, I was fully prepared to hear Maria Ressa, the Filipino journalist and2021 Nobel peace prize laureate, talk about how big tech has, with impunity, allowed its networks to be flooded with disinformation, hate and manipulation in ways that have had very real, negative, impact on elections.But I wasn’t prepared to hear some of the “godfathers of AI”, such as Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, Stuart Russell and Max Tegmark, talk about how things might go much farther off the rails. At the centre of their concerns was the race towards AGI (artificial general intelligence, though Tegmark believes the “A” should refer to “autonomous”) which would mean that for the first time in the history of life on Earth, there would be an entity other than human beings simultaneously possessing high autonomy, high generality and high intelligence, and that might develop objectives that are “misaligned” with human wellbeing. Perhaps it will come about as the result of a nation state’s security strategy, or the search for corporate profits at all costs, or perhaps all on its own.“It’s not today’s AI we need to worry about, it’s next year’s,” Tegmark told me. “It’s like if you were interviewing me in 1942, and you asked me: ‘Why aren’t people worried about a nuclear arms race?’ Except they think theyarein an arms race, but it’s actually a suicide race.”It brought to mind Ronald D Moore’s 2003 reimagining of Battlestar Galactica, in which a public relations official shows journalists: “things that look odd, or even antiquated, to modern eyes, like phones with cords, awkward manual valves, computers that barely deserve the name”. “It was all designed to operate against an enemy that could infiltrate and disrupt all but the most basic computer systems … we were so frightened by our enemies that we literally looked backwards for protection.”Perhaps we need a new acronym, I thought.Instead of mutually assured destruction, we should be talking about “self-assured destruction” with an extra emphasis: SAD! An acronym that might even break through to Donald Trump.The idea that we, on Earth, might lose control of an AGI that then turns on us sounds like science fiction – but is it really so far-fetched considering the exponential growth of AI development? As Bengio pointed out, some of the most advanced AI models have alreadyattempted to deceive human programmersduring testing, both in pursuit of their designated objectives and to escape being deleted or replaced with an update.When breakthroughs in human cloning were within scientists’ reach, biologistscame togetherand agreed not to pursue it, says Stuart Russell, who literally wrotethe textbookon AI. Similarly, both Tegmark and Russell favour a moratorium on the pursuit of AGI, and a tiered risk approach – stricter than theEU’s AI Act– where, just as with the drug approval process, AI systems in the higher-risk tiers would have to demonstrate to a regulator that they don’t cross certain red lines, such as being able to copy themselves on to other computers.But even if the conference seemed weighted towards these future-driven fears, there was a fairly evident split among the leading AI safety and ethics experts from industry, academia and government in attendance. If the “godfathers” were worried about AGI, a younger and more diverse demographic were pushing to put an equivalent focus on the dangers that AIs already pose to climate and democracy.We don’t have to wait for an AGI to decide, on its own, to flood the world with datacentres to evolve itself more quickly – Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, OpenAI and their Chinese counterparts are already doing it. Or for an AGI to decide, on its own, to manipulate voters en masse in order to put politicians with a deregulation agenda into office – which, again, Donald Trump and Elon Musk are already pursuing. And even in AI’s current, early stages, its energy use is catastrophic: according to Kate Crawford, visiting chair of AI and justice at the École Normale Supérieur, data centres already account for more than 6% of all electricity consumption in the US and China, and demand is only going to keep surging.“Rather than treating the topics as mutually exclusive, we need policymakers and governments to account for both,” Sacha Alanoca, a PhD researcher in AI governance at Stanford, told me. “And we should give priority to empirically driven issues like environmental harms, which already have tangible solutions.”To that end, Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face – a collaborative platform for open source AI models – announced this week that the startup has rolled out anAI energy score, ranking 166 models on their energy consumption when completing different tasks. The startup will also offer a one- to five-star rating system, comparable with the EU’s energy label for household appliances, to guide users towards sustainable choices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And beyond regulation, “to make sure there is a culture of participation embedded in AI development in general”, as Eloïse Gabadou, a consultant to the OECD on technology and democracy, put it.At the close of the conference, I said to Russell that we seemed to be using an incredible amount of energy and other natural resources to race headlong into something we probably shouldn’t be creating in the first place, and which the relatively benign versions of are already, in many ways, misaligned with the kinds of societies that we actually want to live in.“Yup,” he replied.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionEuropeClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

Patients who attend the screenings tell of the joy of escaping into movie magicLibby BrooksFri 14 Feb 2025 08.45 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 08.47 ESTShare‘MediCinema is part of my life,” says 12-year-old Lucas Rae-Shreenan. “It just takes me away from what else is happening.” Lucas has been going to screenings put on by the charity, which builds, installs and runs cinemas in hospitals, since before he could talk. His mother, Melanie, would pop him in the pram in front of the screen to get a break from the neonatal unit. On Sunday, that charity will receive the prestigious outstanding British contribution to cinema award at theBaftas.MediCinema has helped Lucas – who spent a sizeable chunk of his childhood at the Glasgow’s royal hospital for children, after he was born with an extremely rare chromosome disorder that means he cannot eat or drink – to become a committed film fan.He even made his own marmalade sandwich out of felt to complement his blue duffle coat costume for a special preview screening of Paddington in Peru last November, unaware that a surprise guest, Hugh Bonneville who plays Mr Brown, was making an appearance.But for Lucas, the best bit about MediCinema is the volunteers who bring patients from the wards and keep them company at the screenings. “One person Billy is in his 80s and we’ve been friends for ages,” Lucas says. “He lets me help him with his jobs, he lets me take the register and take the tickets. Then we sit together and have a wee catch-up before the film starts.”View image in fullscreenLucas Rae-Shreenan with Hugh Bonneville at a MediCinema screening of Paddington in Peru at Glasgow’s Royal hospital for children in November.Photograph: Mark Runacles/Mark RunnaclesLast Monday at around 5.45pm, Billy Rodden and four other volunteers were waiting at the entrance to the purpose-built cinema, with rainbow-coloured seats and clear space at the front to park beds, wheelchairs and IV drips.“The wee ’uns love it,” said Rodden, who has volunteered for the charity for 16 years. “You see the expression on their faces, especially the ones who are in hospital for months at a time, they get to do something normal for a few hours.”As children and their carers began to arrive for the screening of the animated comedy caperDog Man(based on Dav Pilkey’s hugely popular graphic novel series) Rodden strolled around the tiered seating, pausing for a high five here and thereThe audience comprised all ages, stages of treatment and pyjama styles. Everything about the space replicated an ordinary cinema – comfy seats that may encourage a parent or two to nod off; the encompassing darkness, requiring volunteer ushers and the two attending nurses to use torches when assisting toilet visits; the surround sound; and the soundproofing to ensure that nearby wards are not disturbed.Indeed, the only difference between this and a commercial screening is the absence of rustling of snack packets, a blanket policy so that those who are fasting or on restricted diets don’t feel left out.Many of the youngsters are accompanied by their parents. As Melanie, Lucas’s mother, says: “The first time we went it was more of a lift for me.”“But as the years went, the staff became his friends. They’ve known him since he was a baby and watched him grow up. They went through all his milestones with me.”Lucas was also diagnosed with autism at the age of three. “Now the volunteers print out the timetable for him because he enjoys the routine. They take a lot of time with him and it breaks up his day”.“Kids have their own rooms on the wards but can feel quite isolated,” says cinema manager Kate Thomson. “Here, they get to see other kids in hospital, some of them make friends and you can really tell it’s changed their day.”View image in fullscreenMediCinema at St Thomas's hospital, London.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianThe screenings also offer a chance for parents and patients’ siblings to be together as a family, says Thomson. There are private viewings for immunocompromised kids and teenagers can bring schoolfriends in to see a film ahead of its cinema release: “It makes them feel cool, which I’d imagine is not something they feel often in hospital.”The idea for MediCinema came about in 1996, when founder Christine Hill was inspired after seeing nurses at St Thomas’ hospital in London wheeling patients outside in their beds to watch the boats go by on the River Thames.The first MediCinema opened at St Thomas’ in 1999 and the most recent in Alder Hey in Liverpool last November. The charity now has six purpose-built hospital cinemas across England Wales and Scotland, with new MediCinemas soon to come toGreat Ormond Street in London and the Oxford Road campus of Manchester universityNHStrust – the largest trust in the UK. The cinemas operate at no cost to the NHS and in partnership with local hospital charities. And MediCinema’s ambition is to become a national charity with their screens in every NHS region.CEO Colin Lawrence hopes their “incredible” Bafta recognition will hasten that ambition. “It’s such a simple concept that we’re able to have a scalable impact in such a profound way for patients.”“When you walk into MediCinema you don’t feel that you’re in a hospital any longer. You’re enjoying something which everybody in the outside world has access to and that’s a very empowering thing.”“Not only does it bring all the wonder of film, taking you to a place that you might not be able to get to physically, but it diminishes stress, changes people’s moods and you can create connections with other parents or patients.”Lawrence says that the non-medical volunteers who facilitate patients’ visits are just as vital to the whole experience as the hospital staff.View image in fullscreenLucas during one of his early MediCinema screenings“You’ve got somebody who’s not part of the hospital environment, coming into your ward, talking to you about the film saying, ‘We can make this really easy for you’. That’s giving people a sense of agency, isn’t it? There’s a human to human conversation with somebody that sees you as another person, not as a bed number.”That’s precisely the phrase that 27-year-old Claire Pitt Wigmore uses about her own experience of MediCinema at Guy’s and St Thomas’, where she received inpatient treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma for 12 weeks.“It really became a lifeline for me. I wasn’t able to function as a normal human and at times I felt incredibly isolated, sad and angry,” says the guitar teacher and performer, who has been cancer free for 18 months.On her first visit, she had anticipated “a few chairs and a projector. I didn’t expect to walk into a built-in Odeon.”“The volunteers and staff got to know you on first-name terms and asked about your life outside of being in hospital. It was really reassuring to be known as Claire the person, an individual rather than a bed number.”For Nathan Askew, chief nursing officer at Alder Hey, the charity allows staff to build a more relaxed relationship with patients as well as have some fun themselves. “It’s hard working for the NHS at times and this is such a lovely way to use your nursing skills. The children and their families see you in a different role to when you’re their allocated nurse on the ward, and it’s really a bit of a reprieve for everyone.”“The beauty of MediCinema is that it can do so many different things,” says Askew, who has been working with the charity since it opened its cinema at St Thomas’. “For older patients, they’ll do the silver screenings, where you can see someone who’s quite confused with dementia have a period of relative calm through the experience of the film and music. Then there might be a screening for a group of young people who have got the same condition, like a stoma bag, which can be really difficult to talk about.”“You can provide a really tailored experience, so maybe that’s somebody at the end of their life who can have their family around them to watch a movie. And at the other end of the scale you’ve got complete escapism. Film transcends all ages, all cultures, all backgrounds – it’s really powerful.”Explore more on these topicsFilmHospitalsNHSHealthBaftasAwards and prizesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the roar of a wrestler’s body-slam or a diva’s ovation – throaty, triumphant, immoderate. Thomas’s exhibition is all that, and glamorous too, opening with a room of monumental portraits of black women. All are painted on panels with rounded corners – no frame is enclosingthesewomen.Working from staged photographs and found images, Thomas’s compositions are hymns to excess. Figures emerge in fragments from layers of pattern, like the swirling kimonos that unfurl to reveal body parts in Japanese woodcuts. The bodies themselves are radically flattened, rendered in simplified graphic forms like Tom Wesselmann’s Great American Nudes of the 1960s. Yet unlike those nudes, Thomas’s figures have names, and eyes, and agency. Posed naked on a couch covered in florals and animal prints, the woman in A Little Taste Outside of Love (2007) is identified as the artist’s ex-girlfriend Maya.In navigating the territory between joy and sorrow, Thomas has two great weapons at her disposal: rhinestones and Eartha Kitt. A liberal crusting of the former gives these flat paintings depth and movement. In Mama Bush: (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher, violet and indigo highlights sparkle from the artist’s mother’s rhinestone afro. Her smile radiates with such a shimmer you can barely focus. A recent painting of a medical student called Din dances before your eyes in iridescent starbursts.View image in fullscreenMickalene Thomas, Mama Bush: (Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher (2009).Photograph: © Mickalene ThomasThomas reflects on the way black women have been pictured – or not. Tucked in the margins of historical paintings, naked and available as “exotic” objects of desire, occupying their accepted roles as performers. Rhinestones were created to dazzle under electric light and create spectacle on stage. They dress bodies that move for pleasure and entertainment. In applying them to a fixed surface, Thomas makes the viewer do the work. The women in her paintings are going nowhere. We have to move to make them sparkle.Two devastating works are soundtracked by Eartha Kitt. In Me as Muse (2016), a bank of TV screens flickers between patterns and body parts, slowly revealing the reclining nude form of Thomas herself. The audio is a BBC interview in which Kitt describes being cast out of her family, her early years of service and abuse, and the love that evaded her: “There were plenty of men who wanted to lay me down, but none who wanted to raise me up.”In an adjacent gallery, four screens show Kitt singing Angelitos Negros alongside Thomas and two other women, styled and filmed as though all were performing in the 1960s. Their voices implore an artist to paint black angels into a church interior and break the customary depiction of heaven as a literal zone of white supremacy. Kitt weeps as she sings. Thomas, the painter, accepts her challenge, filling the gallery with exalted figures.View image in fullscreenMickalene Thomas, Sleep Deux Femmes Noires (2012).Photograph: © Mickalene ThomasThis exhibition borrows its title from American scholar bell hooks’ all about love (1999), which argues for the importance of love, whether sacred, familial, social or romantic. Taking over the Hayward with domestic furnishings, disco music, shrines filled with favourite books and even shag carpeting, Thomas makes space for intimacy of all kinds. For hooks, the invitation to cherish love had a political imperative: “I feel our nation’s turning away from love as intensely as I felt love’s abandonment in my girlhood.” It’s a sentiment that has become more poignant 25 years after it was written.Danger Came Smiling, an exhibition byLinder, the scalpel-wielding post-punk queen of photocollage, runs concurrently. The juxtaposition is superficially odd: Thomas is glitzy exuberance; Linder, surgical cool. Thomas is monumental. Linder is often confined to the dimensions of the magazine from which she slices imagery. Yet the pairing proves surprisingly canny. Both artists are involved in dissecting the feminine image. Both work with soft-porn and fashion photographs. Both use their own body – Linder flexes her back muscles and dons a boxer’s breastplate; Thomas appears in a tiger-print leotard performing wrestling manoeuvres.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A suite of works in which ballet positions are disrupted by strange undersea creatures was made, Linder notes, while she was caring for her elderly parents. Self-portraits in which she appears covered in coloured goo relate not only to a fetish known as “sploshing” but also to the soft foods with which elderly people can be spoon-fed.The best works here are a deceptively simple marriage of two impeccably matched elements. A woman leaning to embrace a man instead jams a fork into her eye. A “perfect” Aryan athlete transforms into a piece of industrial furniture. Nudes airbrushed to marmoreal smoothness sprout crystal protuberances. This is work of tremendous restraint. The results are frequently brutal.Mickalene Thomas: All About LoveandLinder: Danger Came Smilingare at the Hayward Gallery, London until 5 MayExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its creator and star talk wigs, unfinished business – and what it’s really like being queer in Jamaica todayEllen E JonesFri 14 Feb 2025 08.00 ESTShareYou’ve probably never met anyone quite like Millie Black, the detective protagonist of a new Jamaica-set crime thriller. ButMarlon Jameshas. James is the acclaimed author of five novels, including 2014’s Booker prize winner,A Brief History of Seven Killings, and now he’s making the move into television, as Get Millie Black’s creator – with a disputed source of inspiration. “I keep telling my mother it is not based on her! She thinks I’m in denial,” he tells me down the line from his art-filled Brooklyn apartment.James’s mother, Shirley Dillon-James, was “a pioneer”, he admits: one of the first women to make detective in 1950s Jamaica, “so she was basically working for the queen. She dealt with colonialism, sexism, all of that stuff.” Jamaica gained independence from the UK in 1962, but the “colonialism” and “sexism” parts still figure for Millie Black as she negotiates a career begun in London’s Metropolitan Police, and now transferred to the Kingston Central Division. But also: “Millie may be more influenced by me than by my mom,” says James. “In the sense that I’ve always looked at writing as a form of detective work. It’s always been, how am I gonna solve this mystery?”Ultimately, it is neither the writer nor his mother who will for ever be associated with this instantly iconic TV cop. That honour goes toTamara Lawrance, who stars as Millie – and she couldn’t be happier about it: “If this became the thing I’m known for, I’d be so thankful,” she says. “It really changed my life.” The series opens with a flashback to Millie’s childhood in Jamaica, and the close sibling bond that was severed when their mother sent her to London to live with relatives. Now back in Jamaica for more than a year, Millie is attempting to rebuild family ties and, in the meantime, has become close to her detective partner, Curtis (Gershwyn Eustache Jr), a gay man who must keep his sexuality secret from the rest of their colleagues.View image in fullscreenOfficer politics … Tamara Lawrance and Joe Dempsie in Get Millie Black.Photograph: Des Willie/Channel 4/HBOLawrance was raised in north-west London by her Jamaican mother and always felt connected to her roots through food (“I grew up eating dumpling, callaloo, corned beef and rice – all the staples”) and music (“My mum was a big fan of Sizzla Kalonji, Capleton, Queen Ifrica, Buju Banton”). Still, the show’s shoot was the first time she’d been to Jamaica since she was a toddler and it had a profound effect: “My mum has always been very open and warm, people gravitate to her, and when I went to Jamaica, I saw that in almost everyone I encountered,” she explains. “I felt a lot of who I am sort of synthesise, […] to see that this might come from growing up on an island, not having to be ‘a Black person’, but [in a place where] you form your identity around your personality, rather than your skin colour.”It was also Lawrance’s bone-deep understanding of the nuances of British-Caribbean identity that helped land her the role. She’s so good as Millie Black – competent but fallible, assertive yet vulnerable – you could easily believe it was written with her in mind. In fact, there was a lengthy casting process, says James. “I don’t even think I knew who she was; we were seeing so many people. Then the casting director sent us this video and I’m like: ‘Oh my God! It’s Millie!’” Lawrance wore a shoulder-length, straight-hair wig to audition, “which is not what Millie would wear at all”, but her innate Millie-ness shone through. “Because, more than anything else, Tamara didn’t need cues as to when to switch to Jamaican.”He’s referring to Millie Black’s blend of British-accented English and Jamaican patois, a fairly common way of speaking in many British-Jamaican households. “It was a relatively instinctive choice for me, because of who I understood Millie to be,” says Lawrance. “Somebody who is trying to reintegrate herself, but is ultimately going to be perceived as foreign in Jamaica.”Rapid code-switching is just one of the ways Get Millie Black explores its central theme: the knotty, centuries-old, back-and-forth relationship between Britain and Jamaica. James is a Jamaican national who now lives in the US, where Get Millie Black aired to rave reviews on HBO Max at the end of last year. But “the primary relationship [for Jamaica] is still the UK”, he says. “My Aunt Enid lived there, my Uncle Oscar lived there, my Aunt Pearl lived there … and my Uncle Errol was literally on the Windrush.” That is, the HMT Empire Windrush passenger ship, which landed on British shores in 1948, and became synonymous with postwar Caribbean immigration.View image in fullscreenGender agenda … Chyna McQueen and Tamara Lawrance in Get Millie Black.Photograph: Channel 4“That Steve McQueen series, Small Axe, hit hard because so many of my family went through it, and yet at the same time so much of that world was totally foreign.” The popularity of the London-originated lovers rock reggae sub-genre, for instance. “They have this big moment where everybody’s singing [Janet Kay’s 1979 UK hit] Silly Games, like it’s a major anthem. Me and the other Jamaicans were like: ‘Do you know that song? I’ve never heard of it …’”Even growing up in Jamaica in the 1970s and 80s, studying Shakespeare and Dickens at his prestigious all-boys high school, James felt the influence of the erstwhile “mother country”. “The first time I came to London, I realised I sounded like the butler, because of the English I learned … So why the UK? Because there’s unfinished business.”Namely, the transatlantic slave trade and its legacy, which finds contemporary parallels in the international human-trafficking case Millie and Curtis stumble into. “The slave trade never really ended,” says James. “Yeah, sure, it’s a reverse trade; now we’re going to Europe instead of the quote-unquote ‘colonies’, but it’s still people being trapped. It’s still people being tricked. It’s still people being forced to do things they don’t want to do.”In the show, when Scotland Yard catches wind of Millie’s investigation, they send out a white British detective, Luke Holborn (Joe Dempsie), to assist. Or should that be “take over”? Millie’s relationship with him is occasionally collaborative but mostly antagonistic, an aspect of the writing Lawrance particularly appreciated: “We see a lot of Black characters on TV, especially British TV, that assimilate,” she says. “I don’t think we see very many Black characters that are very pro-Black, in a way that hasn’t become cartoonish or comedic. But Millie is, and she doesn’t give a heck, really, what this guy thinks about her.

(Though this, it has been argued, is itself a legacy of British colonialism.) Through the character of Hibiscus, an impressive performance from trans Jamaican actor Chyna McQueen in her first screen role, Millie is connected to the Gully. This is the local nickname for the storm drains below Jamaica’s New Kingston financial district which, until recently, provided refuge to a real community of LGBTQ+ people. Nowadays most of the former “Gully Queens” have moved on, says James. “Jamaica has come a long way with homophobia – I speak as a queer Jamaican who is there all the time. At the same time, trans women don’t feel safe. A lot of the trans women, including in our cast, have already fled.”Meanwhile, back in the UK, Lawrance, who also identifies as queer, sees Get Millie Black as part of an exciting effort to diversify the stories told about Black Britons on screen, alongside another of her recent, acclaimed projects,Mr Loverman. “You know, I’ve never seen love and relationships explored with that sensitivity or honesty before on British TV,” she says of the BBC adaptation of Bernardine Evaristo’s novel about a closeted Antigua-born Londoner reaching crisis point. “And likewise, I’ve never seen Chyna McQueen on TV before, y’know?”Even within Get Millie Black, multiple perspectives are included, a technique readers of A Brief History of Seven Killings will know well. Also characteristic of James’s style is the deep appreciation for Jamaican music, evident from the opening bars of the theme tune, a new mix of Shanique Marie’s Ring the Alarm that is surely destined for the UK charts (“No, but listen, what a banger!” says Lawrance).It all adds up to a cop show that depicts Caribbean culture with a thrilling intensity still too rarely seen on British television. The anti-Death in Paradise, if you will? James, personally, has nothing against that long-running cosy crime drama, set on the idealised island of Saint Marie. “I think Caribbean comfort food is always welcome,” he says, diplomatically. But Millie Black? She would definitely insist on a little more hot sauce.Get Millie Black is coming to Channel 4 next month.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionDramaMarlon JamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cue the conservative outrage …Steve RoseFri 14 Feb 2025 09.59 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 12.51 ESTShareOf all the times to recast the most iconically American comic-book character with a Black actor and then pit him against a violently angry supervillain with an unnaturally reddish skin tone, who also happens to be the new US president … Sorry if that’s a spoiler, but it is in thetrailer for the new Captain America: Brave New World, just released into a tumultuous Trump-run America that’s itching for another culture war.IfMarvelwas looking for some attention to reignite its beleaguered movie franchise, it seems to have found it – but not necessarily the good kind. If nothing else, the image of a raging red superbeing rising up from behind the presidential podium and then trashing the White House is sure to provoke a reaction. As Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson takes up the star-spangled shield passed on to him by Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers, his casting has already incensed a certain bracket of social media: “The new Captain America! DEI hire!”; “Sounds like another woke disaster from Hollywood”; “Boy, did you not get the memo? America just voted for Trump – your film is dead on arrival.” It’s a wonder Trump hasn’t signed an executive order banning the film yet.Mackie gave his adversaries even more ammunition a couple of weeks ago when he told the Italian press: “To me Captain America represents a lot of different things and I don’t think the term ‘America’ should be one of those representations.” Again, you can imagine the reactions – even if, as fans pointed out, Mackie’s predecessor in the role, Chris Evans, madevery similar commentswhen he was promoting Captain America: “I’m not trying to get too lost in the American side of it. This isn’t a flag-waving movie,” Evans said in 2011. Mackie had to walk back his comments the next day on Instagram: “Let me be clear about this: I’m a proud American and taking on the shield of a hero like Cap is the honour of a lifetime.”These are not the only battles the new Captain America finds itself caught up in. Attention has also focused on Ruth Bat-Seraph, aka Sabra, a minor character in the movie played by Israeli actor Shira Haas. In the original comics, Sabra was “the first Israeli superhero”; a mutant with superpowers who was formerly a Mossad agent. She’s had a bit of a makeover for the movie: no longer a mutant or a Mossad agent but very much a combat-ready operative.In a joint letter, some Palestinian cultural groups complained: “By reviving this racist character in any form, Marvel is promoting Israel’s brutal oppression of Palestinians.” They have called for a boycott of the movie, and pro-Palestinian protesterspicketed the Hollywood premierethis Tuesday, holding up signs saying things such as “Disney supports genocide” – again, necessarily not the good kind of attention.View image in fullscreenRemind you of anyone? Red Hulk/President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford).Photograph: Marvel StudiosAs if that weren’t enough, Brave New World has been plagued by reports of rewrites and reshoots, as well as recastings. William Hurt, who was set to play the US president, Thaddeus Ross, died in 2022 and had to be replaced by Harrison Ford. It was originally slated for release in May 2024. According to one insider, late last year it had gone throughthree rounds of test screeningsand was still getting negative feedback. The film-makers have denied this, although director Julius Onah acknowledged: “Every movie of this scale has additional photography baked into the creative process. There are things you’re going to refine and the story is going to evolve.”Without those delays, the movie might well have come out in the late Biden era, rather than the febrile first few weeks of Trump 2.0. At least they changed the title – the original, Captain America: New World Order might have been too much for the conspiracy theorists to handle.It was somehow inevitable that all this would befall Captain America, rather than any other superhero. He’s always been the moral conscience of the Marvel universe, and by extension, the nation. The character was created by Jewish writers Jack Kirby and Joe Simon in 1940, primarily as a wartime propaganda tool – the US actually entered the war a year later, so perhaps it worked. The cover of issue #1, showing Captain America socking Adolf Hitler on the jaw, told you exactly where his loyalties lay. Now, 85 years later, we find him socking the fictional US president in the jaw instead. And this at a time when the real-life president is happily dining with white supremacists and Nazi sympathisers such as Nick Fuentes and Kanye West (whose recent X post declaring “I’m a Nazi” ought to clear up any ambiguity). Not to mention Trump’s ubiquitous righthand troll Elon Musk, who has done nothing at all to correct impressions that he gave a Nazi salute at Trump’s inauguration a few weeks ago. It leaves you wondering who the real good guys are.View image in fullscreenThe first issue of Captain America, March 1941.Photograph: Courtesy of MarvelTime and again, it’s been down to Captain America to figure that out. While other Marvel movies have gadded about in weightless fantasy realms (Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, Deadpool), the Captain America movies have often reflected off-screen political reality – and despite his ludicrously patriotic get-up (often worn by Trump supporters, or Photoshopped on to Trump himself), Cap has never been afraid to turn against his own government.It’s worth recapping the saga so far. Origin movieCaptain America: The First Avenger, released in 2011, explained how weedy army recruit Steve Rogers (Evans) was given an experimental superhero-creating serum in the 1940s, and riffed on his deployment as a wartime propaganda mascot. Things got interesting with 2014’s The Winter Soldier, in which Rogers is thawed out in the present day and finds the US about to instate a global surveillance regime that would predict and preemptively eliminate threats. This was the era of the Edward Snowden leaks, so the paranoid conspiracy element was not too difficult to swallow. But good old Cap wasn’t having it: “This isn’t freedom – it’s fear,” he said, stepping away from his quasi-military role. He was right: it later transpired that the US government had been infiltrated by the neo-Nazi organisation Hydra – again, a concept that’s no longer too difficult to swallow.And by his side in his fight to de-Nazify the government was Mackie’s character, Sam Wilson, aka Falcon, a modern-day Iraq war veteran who befriended Rogers. In 2016’sCaptain America: Civil War, Rogers and Wilson again fell out with the authorities, refusing to agree to UN oversight of “enhanced individuals” – those with superpowers. They trusted their own judgment above that of the politicians.View image in fullscreenChris Evans in Captain America – First Avenger.Photograph: Marvel Studios/Sportsphoto/Allstar2019’s all-conquering Avengers: Endgame culminated with Evans’ Captain America retiring, and passing on his shield to Mackie’s Falcon. After that the saga headed into race politics and Black history – possibly blown in that direction by the cultural winds post-Black Lives Matter. In his small-screen spin-off Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Falcon hands the shield back to the government – “It feels like it belongs to someone else,” he says. Not only does he deem himself unworthy, his patriotism to a country that enslaved and discriminated against his forebears is understandably conflicted. Another Black character tells him: “They will never let a Black man be Captain America, and even if they did, no self-respecting Black man would ever want to be.” Sure enough, a new, white Captain America is anointed: John Walker, played by Wyatt Russell. But to cut a long story short, it turns out he’s unworthy, and Wilson ultimately winds up with the shield again.Politics were very much in the minds of the Russo brothers, who jointly directed Winter Soldier, Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. “Those movies are very much about what went on in this country over the past four years,” Joe Russotold me in 2021. “Some of the worst people were being attracted to politics and were representing us collectively … We believed strongly that the reach in those movies was so significant that they could be influential in helping people potentially make better decisions. We thought that they were a really powerful tool, at exactly the right time.”Brave New World should at least satisfy fans who wanted a political action thriller along the lines of Winter Soldier, with no space people turning up from parallel universes. Mackie’s fledgling Cap initially agrees to work with Ford’s new president, but before long, he’s disobeying orders and going rogue once again to investigate a conspiracy. Despite the raging Hulk “reveal”, and the president surviving an assassination attempt, Ford’s character is not all that Trump-like: he cares about international cooperation, he has a Black female head of security, and he even gets on an exercise bike on Air Force One. Depending on how you see it, this is either a bullet dodged or a punch pulled. This president does, however, outsource tech and military innovation to a shifty, unbiddable genius scientist who’s described as “his own personal thinktank” – remind you of anyone?There’s no telling how any of this will play in today’s movie landscape. Marvel movies have been at the vanguard of Hollywood representation in recent years but this has not translated into box-office success lately. Recent movie outings such as The Eternals and The Marvels – neither of which were directed by or centred on white men – were met with opposition by some fans (especially the vehement “Everything is woke” brigade), but also by some critics (for not being very good). Meanwhile, Marvel’s franchise-milking small-screen offshoots (Loki, Wandavision, Ms Marvel, She-Hulk, etc) and confusing “multiverse” storylines have turned off even more viewers. It’s telling that Marvel’s only recent box-office success was the more flip and irreverent Deadpool & Wolverine (led by two white guys).View image in fullscreenFlorence Pugh in Thunderbolts.Photograph: Marvel StudiosSo perhaps the message is: nobody’s in the mood for superheroes getting too real and political any more, and the era of applauding movies for representation has been killed by Trump’s anti-DEI edicts. Marvel seems to be hedging its bets: next up, in April, is Thunderbolts – the first outing for a new bunch of (overwhelmingly white) superhero misfits, including Florence Pugh and Wyatt Russell’s John Walker.But ultimately, Mackie was right when he said Captain America was not really about “America”. Unlike the cosplaying Trump supporters, he’s more loyal to American values than to the flag, and over his long history, he’s often had to remind the nation what those values are. In one comic-book story (What If … #44), 1940s Captain America wakes up in 1984, where he finds a fascist “America first” president who is persecuting minorities and promising to make America great again. Cap lays it downin no uncertain terms: “Without its ideals – its commitment to the freedom of all men, America is a piece of trash! I fought Adolf Hitler not because America was great, but because it was fragile! I knew that liberty could as easily be snuffed out here as in Nazi Germany!” Maybe they can use that storyline for the next movie, if there is one.This article was amended on 14 February 2025. The Falcon character Anthony Mackie plays is Sam Wilson, not Jackson as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsFilmCaptain America: Civil WarCaptain America: The First AvengerCaptain America: The Winter SoldierUS politicsHarrison FordMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They all drop into squats and start pushing each other’s knees, trying to make their opponent fall over. On a rainy Saturday afternoon in south London, the women, wearing sweatpants and smiles with giddy energy, are learning some judo and wrestling moves, how to flip each other’s bodies over on a mat, and the basics of defence through a game called Sticky Hands. “I liked the grappling on the floor,” says one of the group, 26-year-old Becky. “I couldn’t stop giggling while we were doing it.”Jackson, a calm presence at the centre of the room, was a teenage judo champion. She’s also a performer, theatre maker and movement director, who has worked on shows includingI, Joanat Shakespeare’s Globe,Cowbois at the RSCand her solo show Endurance, about ultrarunning and resilience, which landed at the intersection between theatre, dance and sporting spectacle. Today she’s training up a Girl Gang, which will form part of the cast for her show WrestleLadsWrestle, which premiered last year in Manchester and is embarking on a tour. In each venue she forms a new amateur cast, assembling women in Sheffield, Cambridge and this group in London.Much in the same way Buffy the Vampire Slayer activated all the potential slayers at the series’ climax, rather than keeping power for herself, Jackson aimed to show all women their potential. “I wanted a real cross-section, as if somebody who’s working in accounts suddenly heard the call and they left the office and kept walking and landed in the theatre and ended up on stage.” One of the new Girl Gang, Ece, 22, admits: “I was far out of my comfort zone. It’s not very often that you go round pushing people. But it was good. I did feel empowered.”View image in fullscreen‘I did feel empowered’ … WrestleLadsWrestle at Home, Manchester, in 2024.Photograph: Chris Payne“We’re much stronger than we think we are,” says Jackson, talking about how women can discover how to use their own weight, their centre of gravity and the huge amount of power in their legs to stand their ground, rather than heed society’s messages “to be slimmer and slimmer and reduce our body size and our visibility in the world”. And also just to have fun. “Wrestling and rolling around on the floor and getting carried away, I just really love that,” says Jackson, “and it feels like a rebellious thing to do still, which it shouldn’t be.”The story of WrestleLadsWrestle comes from a personal memory, when Jackson was growing up in the Midlands and witnessed her Bolivian mother being racially abused in a checkout queue. She remembers her 4ft 11in mum shrinking in the presence of a tall, older man. “My memory is of her making herself invisible,” says Jackson. “It was a moment of powerlessness.” It wasn’t long after that that Jackson’s mum sent her and her siblings to a dojo to learn judo. “She gave her children the gift of self-defence, or the gift of violence, however you choose to look at it.” The show Jackson has made is in part wish fulfilment, an expression of all the times she imagined fighting back like a mini superhero, the clever things she should have said; it’s also a feminist battle cry and “a really joyful reclamation of space, and this memory”. But it’s also about memory itself, and how our black-and-white narratives often aren’t all they seem.Teenage Jackson never took her fighting skills outside the dojo – “I was actually really quiet at school, but in competition I was really confident” – but she does remember specialist self-defence teachers coming to the judo sessions. All the men would go off and do weight training while the girls would have a workshop on how to convert their judo skills into something they could use in a real-life attack. Everyone took that to be completely normal: the onus on women to defend themselves rather than men not to attack women.View image in fullscreen‘I wanted a real cross-section of women’ … WrestleLadsWrestle at Home, Manchester, in 2024.Photograph: Chris PayneThrough judo, Jackson learned to evaluate risk, she says. And her training was hugely formative in many ways. “I got to learn how to use my body beyond the aesthetic,” she says. What mattered was what her body could do, not what it looked like. “I also got a real sense of the direct correlation between the work you put in and the mastery of things. I think dancers and musicians also feel that. For acting, it’s more nebulous.”What Jackson wants to give the women in her Girl Gangs is a chance to play out a version of themselves they haven’t inhabited before. The age range across the different cities is wide, with some women in their 60s. They all gave themselves wrestling names. “One called herself the Granny Grappler,” says Jackson. “I’m just loving it for her. She’s really strong and capable and brilliant. And another of our over-60s called herself the Ovarian Barbarian.

Maria, on the verge of flunking out of nun school, didn’t stand a chance. The PG sexual tension then becomes unbearableduring a ländler; the captain can’t take his eyes off Maria, forcing her to blush so hard that she legs it back to the abbey. But after the reverend mothertalks sense into her(choose the captain, not God, duh!) the pair reunite and finally confess their love in a gazebo, before singing in the moonlight: “Here you are standing there loving me, whether or not you should”. Not even the revelation that the actors were told off forlaughing so muchduring filming can dim the romance – it only adds to the adolescent thrill of it all. And the one tiny, goose-pimply moment that tops it off is Von Trapp whispering: “Oh, my love.”Hollie RichardsonBad timing in CasablancaView image in fullscreenIngrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.Photograph: Warner Bros./Kobal/REX/ShutterstockIt’s 1940 and Paris is falling to the Nazis, watched from a high window by Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund, who, with devil-may-care defiance, drink champagne and crack wise about their “bad timing” in choosing now to fall in love. What was Ilsa doing 10 years ago, Rick wonders. Ilsa says she was getting braces fitted for her teeth and asks him the same question. Rick answers with a reticent, manly smile, as if amused by a memory that would never otherwise be dredged up: “Looking for a job …” Apart from anything else, this is a great age-gap romance (Humphrey Bogart is 43; Ingrid Bergman, 28) and the film alludes, perhaps daringly, to the fact that Rick was an adult during the Depression, while Ilsa was a schoolgirl (he does, after all, call her “kid”). While she was sublimely innocent of life’s cares, Rick was worried about money. Perhaps even now, he does not care to tell Ilsa exactly what he was doing when she was getting her braces fitted. There is such gorgeous, protective romantic gallantry in this moment.Peter BradshawThe photograph at the end of TitanicTypically, when I tell people thatTitanicalways makes me cry, they assume I mean the scene where Leonardo DiCaprio sinks into the abyss. Incorrect. That scene is just fine. What really gets me is the very end of the movie, when the camera pans over elderly Rose’s photos as she sleeps (or dies). This woman lived a full life – married, had kids, rode on horseback, travelled the world – yet in her final moments, what she remembers is a brief, long-ago affair with a man who never got to age. That, at the age of 101, Rose DeWitt Bukater would still think about her two torrid days with Jack Dawson – that your love could burn so intensely you feel it for the rest of your life; that his face could be so beautiful it haunts your final hours– was a cataclysmic revelation to my 12-year-old self. And it remains James Cameron’s most convincing fantasy, an insanely romantic notion that, despite all my lived experience, reason, equanimity and general distaste for mushiness, still hits.Adrian HortonAwkward listening in Before SunriseA boy and a girl step into a listening booth. They don’t know the record shop or the city; they barely even know each other. Director Richard Linklater decided not to play his actors the track – Come Here, by Kath Bloom – before filming and you can see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy suppressing smiles when the vocal kicks in, tempted to deflect the song’s raw emotion by cynically laughing it off. The awkwardness builds. We assume that a fumbling kiss must be coming. But it is the song that’s the kiss. It moves them and blesses them and allows them to stroll on through the city and have another kiss somewhere else.Xan BrooksAn orphaned lamb in God’s Own CountryPlaying out in the harsh setting of a Yorkshire farm, God’s Own Country is about a young man, Johnny (Josh O’Connor) whose family life, though rooted in love, is as jagged and inhospitable as the landscape. Then Gheorghe (Alec Secareanu), a Romanian, turns up to help with lambing. Unlike the Saxby family, Gheorghe has a softness to him, and a kindness. In one scene, Gheorghe dresses an orphaned lamb in the skin of another that has just died, so that the tiny creature is accepted, and suckled, by a new mother. It is the film’s turning point: the moment when Johnny begins to learn the meaning of gentleness, tenderness and love.Charlotte HigginsEyes lock over La Vie en Rose in A Star Is BornThe first meeting between Ally (Lady Gaga) and Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) – if you can call it that – is so heady, so beguiling, that it makes A Star Is Born’s inevitable slide into tragedy even more devastating. At the film’s core is the idea that true love allows you to see someone’s true self, without any of the baggage that comes from fame or money or addiction – and that great art might be a way to communicate that truth to the wider world. Watching Jackson go from scepticism to adoration to love at first sight in the course of one song feels like the apotheosis of that idea.Shaad D’SouzaA damp proposal in Pride and PrejudiceIt’s hardly a picture of an aspirational romance. He’s just a boy, standing in front of a girl, telling her that in spite of his better judgment and her lower social class, he loves her “most ardently”. A roiling argument understandably ensues. Though what gives the scene, from Joe Wright’s 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, a sense of romantic drama is composer Dario Marianelli’s racing score, the pounding rain, the lush greenery and, most importantly, the burning chemistry between Keira Knightley’s Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen’s Mr Darcy. Between trading barbs thick with sexual tension (Elizabeth: “your arrogance and conceit, your selfish disdain”) the rain-drenched protagonists draw closer and closer until they are inches away from a kiss. When Darcy pauses and walks away, Elizabeth’s face says it all: love can be very confusing.Rebecca LiuThe press conference in Roman HolidayIn just a few minutes, during which only coded formalities are spoken, Crown Princess Ann (Audrey Hepburn) clocks that one of the reporters lined up before her (Gregory Peck) is the man with whom she has been secretly carousing around Rome; he indicates that he is not going to betray her; and both of them acknowledge that despite the depth of their feelings, this is where they must leave it – although he can’t help but look back towards the empty stage when everyone else has gone. Never have discretion, restraint, dignity, realism and the sadness of a road that cannot be taken seemed so romantic.Chris TryhornA pregnancy test in If These Walls Could Talk 2The three parts of this little-seen 2000 film are each set in the same house in different time periods; all three sets of inhabitants are lesbians. In the final section, set in what would have been the present day when the film was released, a couple played by Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres are trying for a baby with a sperm donor. It ends with a wonderful scene in which Stone’s character has found out she is pregnant and the pair dance around the bathroom in their slippers to Natalie Cole’s This Will Be. It may not be anything like your classic fairytale ending – there’s no grand gesture, no heartfelt speech, and obviously no Prince Charming – but it shows a private, joyful moment between two people who have been loving each other for a long time.Lucy KnightSilence in the diner in The Bourne UltimatumEconomy is the key to romance in the movies. Here, we see two people, shot in alternating over-the-shoulder closeups. After some exposition, Bourne asks what we’ve all been thinking: why do you keep popping up in his movies? Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) takes a beat, puts down her coffee cup. “It was difficult … for me. With you.”They look at each other, Nicky searching his face for clues, Bourne granite-faced. The silence stretches, uncomfortably (actually, 15 seconds). We’re also looking at their faces for clues.“You really don’t remember anything?”“No.”Two cops walk in. “We need to go.”And … back to the Bourney stuff. But it’s all there, in that 40-odd seconds, for viewers to divine for themselves.Jason DeansA last-gasp declaration in A Matter of Life and DeathFalling in love as you believe you’re about to die? Opening scenes don’t get more operatically romantic. It’s the second world war, and Royal Air Force pilot Peter Carter (David Niven), his plane badly damaged, is signing off from this mortal realm to radio operator June (Kim Hunter). Quoting Walter Raleigh and poet Andrew Marvell (“What a marvel!”), Niven makes Carter the quintessential dashing Brit, his stiff upper lip softened by a smile. He asks June if she’s pretty: “Not bad,” she replies sorrowfully, a sublime comic moment from Hunter that tempers the whole scene. The film began production in the same week the war ended, and the whole thing is charged with love for existence itself: “I love you, June, you’re life and I’m leaving you,” as Carter says so magnificently.Ben Beaumont-ThomasThe mushroom omelette in Phantom ThreadGrand romantic gestures are not part of most people’s lives, the quotidian reality of being and putting up with someone barely recognisable from the fantasy offered up on screen. But Paul Thomas Anderson’s magnum opusPhantom Threadshows us an epic act of love that’s both absurdly perverse and immediately relatable. It’s the moment when, putting two and two – and mushrooms – together, Daniel Day-Lewis’s petulant egotist knowingly eats the poisoned omelette made by Vicky Krieps’s exasperated bride. It’s about so much – relinquishing control, understanding balance, embracing change, a dom allowing another dom to play sub – and it’s easily the most romantic movie moment to precede a hellish, fight-for-your-life day on the loo.Benjamin LeeSally Hawkins’ declaration in SpencerView image in fullscreenSally Hawkins and Kristen Stewart in Spencer.Photograph: YouTubeWhile there are myriad possible inspirations for Maggie, Diana’s royal dresser in Pablo Larraín’s biopic, there is no evidence of queer romance or close adoration in Diana’s own life. But when Maggie, played by Sally Hawkins, tells Kristen Stewart’s Diana, “I’m in love with you. Yes, I mean in that way. Completely,” you feel comforted that this woman who is so tormented by the expectation of performance in a loveless marriage finds some genuine kinship, even if it’s not totally returned in that way, and even if it is fiction. The royal family want to subject Diana to treatment for her illness, to which Maggie says, “Fuck doctors, what you need is love. Love, shocks and laughter.” The two run around on the beach, Diana finally knowing love and freedom, before departing – implicitly for ever.Jason OkundayeA heroin-hallucinated kiss in Sid & NancySex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) and his girlfriend Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb) are slumped in bed in a smack-induced stupor. “Just gimme a kiss,” slurs Sid. Cut to a wide-shot of the pair in a smoky, steely-blue New York alleyway, snogging against a dumpster as rubbish falls from the sky in slow motion; the woozy score mounts and spirals, a synthesised ticking sound seeming to warn the pair that time is running out. There is nothing romantic about where the film is heading, and its director Alex Cox rightly regrets the “bogus” ending, in which the dead lovers take a yellow taxi cab to the afterlife. (“We should have shown Sid dying in a pool of vomit,” Cox said.) But that only makes this fleeting hallucinated kiss, mournfully photographed byRoger Deakins, all the more precious.Ryan GilbeyThe will-they-won’t-they close of The LunchboxThis Mumbai-set romance is a film of exquisite poignancy and restraint in which – spoiler alert – the couple don’t even meet. They connect via a mixup over a misdelivered lunchbox and communicate via chaste letters. A meeting is arranged, but the lonely Saajan (Irrfan Khan) steps back, doubting himself, unable to take the decisive step that will return him to life. The final scene always has me holding my breath. Ila (a luminous Nimrat Kaur) has finally resolved to leave her neglectful and unfaithful husband. She sells her wedding jewellery and writes – in her head – a final letter to Saajan as she prepares to catch a train for Bhutan, where happiness is valued higher than money. Or is that just a dream? Is something far darker planned? But Saajan has at last found his own courage and, squatting in the train carriage amid the singingdabbawalaswho can lead him to the owner of the lunchbox, is making his way to Ila, his soulmate. Will they connect or will he arrive too late? The ending is left open. I can think of no other film in which I yearn quite so ardently for the two to live happily ever after.Imogen TildenThe fish tank in Romeo + JulietThere’s no pretending we don’t know how this story ends. Even so, the love-at-first-sight moment in Luhrmann’s Shakespeare update is the cutest of meet-cutes. At the Capulet ball, Des’ree croons the film’s slowest, most beautiful song, while Romeo the knight (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet the angel (Claire Danes) catch each other’s blue eyes, either side of an ostentatious aquarium. The barrier between them deflects their glances and distorts their curious faces. They are almost kissing, so close that Romeo bumps his nose on the glass. The illusion places them both together and apart, flesh and ghosts in the same instant – the whole story of the play in a minute of screen time.Pamela HutchinsonThe final-reel revelation in You’ve Got MailThe final scene of Nora Ephron’s You’ve Got Mail is one of the most spellbinding in romcom history. Bookstore owners Joe (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen (Meg Ryan) fall in love as anonymous strangers on the internet, back when we all had dial-up modems and tinder was used to light a fire. When Joe learns Kathleen is actually the woman he put out of business, he works to win her over through friendship – and succeeds. I’ve never not cried at the climax, when Joe walks round the park with his adorable pup Brinkley and Kathleen tears up because she’s happy it’s him. “I wanted it to be you. I wanted it to be you so badly,” she says, as he wipes the tear from her cheek and says, “Don’t cry, shopgirl”. Yes, some of it is dated, but the message stands: true love transcends all else.Nadia KhomamiA birthday surprise in Betty BlueA hapless handyman and a volatile woman are motoring through rural France in a magnificent yellow Mercedes. It is the golden hour before sunset – the clock is stuck on this hour in Betty Blue – and they’ve run out of road. Penniless, aspiring writer Zorg reveals that, somehow, he’s bought this land for Betty. He pops the Mercedes’ boot to reveal her birthday cake, candles ablaze. They embrace and the cake goes flying. They are fantasists and dreamers. Betty is 20, my age when I watched this film, where every scene shimmers with colour and passion. It is probably unacceptable to enjoy Betty Blue today. Unless you’re 20, in which case you’re allowed to love this indulgent, doomed true romance.Patrick BarkhamSomeone else’s diary in The English PatientView image in fullscreenFiennes and Scott Thomas in the film.Photograph: Cinetext/Miramax/Allstar“Am I K, in your book? I think I must be.” It’s still impossible to figure out why this moment inThe English Patientis so touching. To recap: Ralph Fiennes is quite hot, I guess, but also quite a difficult individual – even (spoiler) before he gets burned to a cinder. Taciturn, complicated; he’s not lousy with friends, put it that way. Kristin Scott Thomas is just staggeringly beautiful in this film, but female actors often are, to no noticeable emotional effect.They’ve been stuck in a moment of high jeopardy, a sandstorm; she’s found his diary, he adores everything about her. She could let it lie. He definitely wouldn’t have pushed it (see taciturn, above). She essentially seals her own fate, unleashes everything, by asking – in the very question, she declares her own feelings. But so discreetly!Zoe WilliamsThe kiss of life in The MatrixThe Wachowskis’ epic paranoia fable is about many things: human batteries, downloading things into your brain and how to wear awesome leather overcoats – but at its heart it’s an amazingly powerful love story, without which none of the other crud about computer simulations and sentient programs would have a fraction of their impact. Yes, the film is about the search for The One, but it’s also about the search for “the one” (which means that, bear with me here, Trinity is actually the film’s protagonist, not Neo).Part of the not inconsiderable brilliance of this film is the way it all ties together in the climactic clinch. Picture the scene: inside the Matrix, the agents have just filled Neo full of lead; aboard the Nebuchadnezzar, real-world Keanu, in his fetching suedehead and grey rags, is dead on the table, and Trinity gives it everything with her life-restoring smooch. (She does spoil the effect slightly, true, by barking “Now get up!” in a drill sergeant’s voice straight after.) It’s the messianic resurrection of the dead Neo, the moment of face-exploding victory, and of course a heart-rending piece of human-on-human intimacy as marauding metal jellyfish try to rip everyone to shreds. As a distillation of the power of love it could hardly be bettered.Andrew PulverA Mills & Boon moment in Bram Stoker’s Dracula“I have crossed oceans of time to find you.” In a movie devoted to the complications of Francis Ford Coppola’s libido, the cinematograph scene is the one unabashed, Mills & Boon, full-swoon moment. Gary Oldman’s hip Transylvanian gunslinger catches up with Winona Ryder’s Mina in London, introducing himself with a touch of Borat: “Do not fear me.” About to take what he wants, but confronted with her innocence, he suffers a case of canine erectile dysfunction, and they wind up petting a giant escaped albino wolf. Coppola is unable to still his beating art: the vampire gliding his would-be lover backwards through the sumptuous period sets; the Slavic lashings of Wojciech Kilar’s score drenching them; and the undead marvels of the cinematograph all around, revealing the director’s true infatuation.Phil HoadThe first meeting in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindIn a film full of moments that capture the messy, intractable nature of romantic love, it’s the scene where Kate Winslet’s Clementine and Jim Carrey’s Joel first meet that never fails to seal the deal. With its non-chronological structure (crucial to the premise of Joel recalling the couple’s relationship as he undergoes a procedure to delete Clementine from his memory), the boy-meets-girl moment occurs at the end of the film, just before the erasure process is complete and he will, supposedly forever, forget that his ex existed.The setting is fittingly devoid of glamour: they are sitting on steps at a windy beach in Montauk, she wearing her signature bright orange hoodie, he eating a plate of picnic food. But then come the glimpses of an affinity that will grow so strong that even memory erasure cannot break it. She takes food off his plate without his permission (“It was so intimate, like we were already lovers”, Joel recalls). He tells her with heart-searing restraint: “I think your name is magical.”It’s all so very apposite to the film’s fundamental message that love can be, at its best, the ordinary, the incidental, even the mundane.Devika BhatA kiss by a BMW in Pretty in PinkIt was the kiss at the end that did it. Girl meets boy, falls out with boy, but romance and hormones conquer all, leading to a very passionate congress in a car park, as the credits roll to Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. I’m talking about the final scene in Pretty in Pink, a film that struck a nerve. It still does, for some unfathomable reason.Rich boy Blane (Andrew McCarthy) was nothing like teenage me. And kooky girl Andie (Molly Ringwald) was nothing like any of the girls I knew back then.In truth, there weren’t that many of them, if any. Still, she seemed bewitchingly beautiful and he was a total dork. And they ended up together! Now I remember why I liked it so much.Nick HopkinsSeeing each other in Portrait of a Lady on FireView image in fullscreenNoémie Merlant and Adèle Haenel in Portrait of a Lady on Fire.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyThe romance of Portrait of a Lady On Fire is as beautiful as it is unsentimental. Marianne, an artist, has been painting Héloïse without her knowledge. But when Héloïse eventually finds out and agrees to sit for the portrait, around halfway through the film, she carefully reveals that she, too, has been secretly observing Marianne. As they exchange notes on each other’s barely perceptible habits, their imbalances of power, social and economic, are levelled out. The situation may have been transactional at the start, but in this moment they become equals. They don’t kiss, yet, but acknowledge their desire by really seeing each other. Gorgeous.Rebecca NicholsonThe start of UpUp begins with old-man protagonist Carl as a young kid, meeting his soulmate Ellie. They’re both obsessed with adventure, and he promises to take her on their own one day.The swelling music of the ensuing montage has a Pavlovian power over my tear ducts now, scoring the most exquisite, tragic romance to ever (nonsensically) open a kids’ film. There’s a marriage, a house, a nursery – and then a calamitous visit to the fertility doctor. Afterwards, Carl spots Ellie sitting in their garden, her devastated eyes closed to the sun. He joins her out there to remind her of that other adventure he promised.Accidents will thwart that dream too, but life goes on – and now they are grey and laughing and slow-dancing in the living room. I won’t spoil what happens next, but it has eclipsed the rest of the plot for me. Something about robot dogs who talk? Who cares. I’m scrolling back to the start.Steph HarmonSharing a laugh at a boring party in The Age of InnocenceThere are plenty of scenes in cinema of men falling for women based on their looks, and you’d have to be a fool not to see that looking like Michelle Pfeiffer certainly helps in that department. But what makes this scene from The Age of Innocence so magical is the giddy way that Daniel Day-Lewis giggles at her mischievous perspective on polite New York society, showing us that repressed straight arrow Newland Archer is attracted – almost against his will – by the countess Ellen’s sense of humour. She’s witty, perceptive and irreverent, which he finds magnetic, and he’s startled by that, as if he’s never met a woman who made him properly laugh before – which given his respectable life among predictable people, he probably hasn’t.Catherine BrayThe end of CarolWhen I learned Todd Haynes was adapting Patricia Highsmith’s novel The Price of Salt, my first thought was: “I hope he doesn’t change the ending” – a rare happy one for a lesbian couple in a novel published in 1951. Therese realises she must be withCaroland rushes out of a party to find her in a restaurant, thinking: “It would be Carol, in a thousand cities, a thousand houses, in foreign lands where they would go together, in heaven and in hell.” But Haynes captures these breathless final pages so perfectly, Carter Burwell’s rich score swelling as Therese (Rooney Mara) spots the statuesque Carol (Cate Blanchett) and walks towards her. No words are needed; you can feel the weight of everything they have been through over the last two hours, how far we have come in regards to same-sex love over the last century. The moment they lock eyes makes me cry every time.Sian CainCooking in MoonlightView image in fullscreenTrevante Rhodes and Andre Holland in Moonlight.Photograph: David Bornfriend/Plan B Entertainment/AllstarRomcoms are forever telling us that the height of romance is a big gesture: an airport run; a limo; a boombox. But those big demonstrations are for the film, not the beloved. InMoonlight, that act of love is a small one: Kevin cooks a meal for Chiron. But that dish could not be freighted with more meaning, hence why the griddled meat, clumsily moulded rice and smattering of herbs take on such a heartstopping quality, in Barry Jenkins’s intimate direction of the glowing last act. Here at last is the tenderness Chiron has always needed; here, at last, is love.Caspar SalmonA healing touch in WALL-EWe’ve all been out of love, but few longer than when WALL-E the Waste Allocation Load Lifter robot finds himself stranded for 700 years on an otherwise deserted futuristic planet Earth. When Eve the Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator arrives to scan the planet for sustainable life, WALL-E falls in love and does everything any self-respecting single robot would do – desperately tidying up his embarrassingly messy bachelor pad, and wooing Eve with the first sprouting plant on Earth for 700 years. If you don’t have a tear in your eye when Eve restores the broken WALL-E’s personality by holding hands and giving him a kiss to Michael Crawford’s It Only Takes A Moment from Hello Dolly, you’re simply not human.Rich PelleyThe poppyfield kiss in A Room with a ViewHard to overstate the contrast between grey central London in 1986 and the golden, creamy world of Ivory and Merchant. I’d bunked off school to go and see A Room with A View, and from the very first moment I was pulled through the magic portal. When Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) – a bit grumpy and moody, prickly, wooden and wonderful – stepped through a Florentine meadow full of sunshine to be passionately kissed by George Emerson, I felt as if I would explode, and for days afterwards I was vibrating with excitement. A 14-year-old full of longing and dreams, waiting for her life to start and hoping it would all be just like this.Bibi van der ZeeCycling in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance KidThere is something exhilarating about the impossibly gorgeous Katherine Ross riding on the handlebars of the impossibly gorgeous Paul Newman as they lark about before heading to the wilds of Bolivia. The fun bike stunts (mostly done by Newman himself), interspersed with dazzling smiles and streaming sunlight, come with a brief sense of freedom, before Butch and Sundance must go on the run. The sweetness is cut through with a sense of what can never be – not least because Ross is actually the girlfriend of Newman’s partner in crime, played by Robert Redford.Music is key. The gentle melody of Burt Bacharach’s Raindrops morphs into jaunty vaudeville music as Newman shows off madly, before crashing backwards into a fence. The kiss he blows to the bull is just fabulous. Purists might say the scene doesn’t fit with the rest of the film. But it’s gloriously romantic never the less.Clare MargetsonBuns and lung disease in Brief EncounterBrief Encounter is usually described as a weepie. It’s easy to forget how queasy it is, too. Noël Coward and David Lean’s film is totally vertiginous; it snatches the breath as though you were teetering on the platform edgeas the express train screams past.Even its most doe-eyed moment makes you feel a bit sick. After their first jolly, innocent-ish, accidental afternoon together, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard have tea and buns in the station cafe before their trains. He starts evangelising about preventative medicine for pneumoconiosis and, very suddenly, she realises she’s in love with him. And he knows. And it’s mutual. Everything changes in a silent, polite split-second of horrific electricity. And then the awful, glorious fall.Catherine ShoardShare your viewNow it's your turn – what's your favourite romantic moment in cinema?

You’d be over by your third album’: De La Soul on grief, Gorillaz and never giving upStevie ChickTwo years after the death of Trugoy, the remaining duo are still feeling raw. They relive the daisy age they built together – and explain how their late bandmate inspires themFri 14 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 14 Feb 2025 04.53 ESTShareIn early 2023,De La Soul– Kelvin “Posdnuos” Mercer, Dave “Trugoy the Dove” Jolicoeur and Vincent “Maseo” Mason – were preparing the reissue of perhaps the most warmly loved discography in hip-hop. Their albums had long been absent from streaming platforms, due to disagreements with their old label, Tommy Boy, and issues over samples that needed to be cleared. “It felt like we’d been erased from history,” says Posdnuos. “A whole new generation wasn’t being introduced to our music.” After years of legal wrangling, the first six albums were primed to resurface, promoted by TV appearances and a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London. De La Soul’s long-awaited resurrection was about to happen.But Posdnuos was anxious. While Maseo and their longtime producer Prince Paul had been working on the reissues, Posdnuos and Trugoy had spent 2022 on Gorillaz’s epic world tour, performing their collaboration Feel Good Inc each night. “Dave had been having issues with his heart for a few years,” Posdnuos says. “And it was alotfor him to go out and perform that song. I told Mase: ‘I don’t know how we gonna put new music out or play De La shows where Dave will have to be on stage for an hour.’ But I didn’t knowhowserious it was, because Dave wasn’t letting us know.”Trugoy died on 12 February, two weeks before the reissues were released. “It was devastating,” Posdnuos says by phone, almost two years to the day after Trugoy’s death. “It’s still shocking to me.”View image in fullscreen‘Lots of other MCs were clowning around like us – we put it on record’… (from left)Maseo, Posdnuos and Trugoy in 1989.Photograph: Paul Natkin/WireImage/Getty ImagesTheir friendship had held strong for almost 40 years. The trio developed their bond in the summer of 1985, stuck inside studying at Amityville Memorial high school in Long Island, New York, having failed their English exam. Today, on a separate call, Maseo reckons that enforced stint in summer school was a “divine intervention”. Without it, they might never have become De La Soul, might never have reshaped rap’s macho paradigm in their own joyful image or kickstarted the Native Tongues movement that defined late-80s hip-hop in New York.“Hip-hop drew us closer together,” says Posdnuos, speaking as he and Maseo prepare to reissue 2004’s The Grind Date. A budding DJ who wrote rhymes for friends, he never liked the sound of his voice, he says, although he loved messing about with Trugoy and Maseo, imitating heroes such as Slick Rick and Doug E Fresh. “But then I realised: Dave is actuallygood– the way his voice sounds, the cool metaphors he’s coming up with. And he’s egging me on, too: ‘Yo, Merce, I love your cadences.’”This spirit of encouragement was crucial to the group’s development. Their conversational flows and lyrics laden with in-jokes seemed weird in the context of the braggadocious rap of the time, but in the safe space of Maseo’s basement, the nascent De La Soul flourished. “If we’d paired with other people, maybe we’d have tried to be braggadocious,” Posdnuos says. “But we implementedfuninto our rhyming – the intelligence we displayed at school. Later on, we realised lots of other MCs and groups were clowning around like us, but when they got down to business they presented themselves in a different way.Weput it on record.”People would tell us: ‘You’re our introduction to hip-hop.’ Our honesty – our vulnerability – was our superpowerCollaborating on rhymes gave Posdnuos an intimate insight into Trugoy: “The way Dave would word things, it was a peek into another aspect of him. Like the way he could read a newspaper, the way he took in information – this fierce intelligence would come out in the way he chose to write.” But Trugoy also had an irrepressible humour that brought their music alive. “Dave could mess up a rhyme and then spin it off into saying something so silly and we’re all laughing. That’s where all the skits came from.”Mason’s friend Prince Paul, a DJ and producer with the Brooklyn crew Stetsasonic, was taken with an early demo and adopted a protective, almost paternal role in the group. “Paul brought an amazing order to our young, chaotic, creative minds,” says Posdnuos. “He made sure our camaraderie continued in the studio and told us: ‘Stay supportive of each other.’” Paul loved the trio’s clowning and “kept the environment clean and safe for us: ‘No rules, just go for it!’”And they did. The resulting debut album,3 Feet High and Rising, still sounds like nothing else, a riotous whirlwind of daffy skits, rhymes that tempered wisdom with wit, and beats that lifted from pop and soul classics to became classics in their own right. 3 Feet High fielded anthems of oddball individualism (Me, Myself and I), anti-drug messages (Say No Go) and a sublime love song that stitched together Steely Dan’s jazz-rock licks and Otis Redding’s plaintive whistle (Eye Know), while Prince Paul translated the trio’s playfulness and in-joking into the skits that linked the tracks together.A sublime love song … watch the video for Eye Know.Meanwhile, Tommy Boy cannily marketed the group. The sleeve designer Tony Mott later explained the DayGlo, flower-strewn sleeve as a conscious move away from “the prevailing macho hip-hop visual codes which dominate to this day”, while magazine ads depicted preppy white yuppies and middle-aged Black women who had gone shopping for U2 and Patti LaBelle albums, but came home with De La Soul instead. The inference was that De La Soul were reaching markets usually beyond rap’s reach. “People were so enamoured with the fluorescent colours, the bright messaging, sitting among everything else in the culture,” says Posdnuos of what the band called the daisy age. “They’d tell us: ‘You’re our introduction to listening to hip-hop.’ Our honesty – our vulnerability – was our superpower.”The album topped Billboard’s R&B/hip-hop chart (and reached No 13 in the UK album chart). It spearheaded an insurgent movement of kindred spirits – including A Tribe Called Quest, Queen Latifah, the Jungle Brothers and Black Sheep – known as the Native Tongues. Received wisdom has it that the group then rebelled against the boho hippy image bestowed upon them with a self-inflicted sophomore slump, 1991’s De La Soul Is Dead. It did feature three wilted, unpotted daisies on the cover, but Posdnuos says the truth is more nuanced. “The second album was still bright and fun,” he says. “OK, the word ‘dead’ in the title doesn’t help … But we meant it to indicate we were transferring to another plane, that we were metamorphosing into older kids. We were just growing. It was a beautiful, funny, zany album.”We got so much to give – for ourselves, for our legacy, for Dave. His family were adamant: ‘If you stop, Dave stops’But there were also darker moments, he acknowledges – tracks such as My Brother’s a Basehead and Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa, a decidedly unfestive narrative involving the murder of a sexually abusive father working as a department-store Santa. “My storytelling instincts were emerging,” says Posdnuos. “My own brother was a freebaser, so I based that song loosely on him; I’m glad to say he’s been sober for many a year now. And Millie was inspired by seeing a homeless guy in a Santa suit in the subway, but also by someone dear to me who’d been molested by her father. The emotion I put in my pen was real.”De La Soul is Dead didn’t replicate 3 Feet High’s smash success, but it signalled their intention to evolve within a genre still so young that no one knew what a long-term rap career might look like. “Hip-hop used to be like dog years,” Maseo says. “You’d be over by your third album.”But De La Soul’s third, 1993’s Buhloone Mindstate, was a mature, jazz-informed masterpiece, the zaniness tempered by loss, the waning of the Native Tongues collective and the responsibilities of adulthood. “We were all new parents,” says Posdnuos. “Our lives were changing, we were calming down. But we still really confident and secure in our creativity.”Guest appearances from the funk veterans Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley and Pee Wee Ellis were inspirational. “It was amazing, the soulfulness of it all,” says Posdnuos. “We got to see them cookin’, coming up with things on the spot. Afterwards, we sat around with them for hours and the James Brown war stories came out. And the way they joked and bugged out … We were like: ‘That’s us! They just like us! We just don’t have instruments!’”View image in fullscreen‘This fierce intelligence would come out in the way he chose to write’ … Trugoy in 2016.Photograph: Matthew Eisman/Getty ImagesThe terrain grew trickier for De La Soul, however. “Younger rappers were taking shots at us, calling us ‘old skool’ even before we had a fourth album out,” says Maseo. De La Soul’s fourth, 1996’s Stakes Is High, was dark and weighty, its title track a rumination on poisonous concepts of realness in hip-hop, produced by “the amazing, unfathomable” J Dilla. Posdnuos says Trugoy – “being the super-genius he is” – delivered the first verse in one take, “like the Old Testament, the Qur’an and the Torah wrapped together”.Label troubles hobbled the third part of the mooted trilogy Art Official Intelligence, but in 2005 they were approached by Damon Albarn to make a record with Gorillaz. “It was a blessing,” says Maseo. “They offered us a track, but we explained we wanted tocollaborate. That broke the ice for our brotherhood with Damon. Next thing, a lotta tequila and weed came out and he’s playing us 30 song ideas. Feel Good Inc popped up and it was a vibe.” The creative connection between the MCs remained as sharp as ever. “We was at this Ginsu-sharp level of rhyming,” Posdnuos says, referring to an American knife brand. “Me and Dave always playing off each other, even still.”‘A new style of speak’: the lyrical genius of De La Soul’s Trugoy the DoveRead moreEven as they had to turn to crowdfunding for their most recent album, 2016’s And the Anonymous Nobody, the friendship between the trio sustained them. “Once you travel with someone, that’s when you get to know a motherfucker,” says Posdnuos. “We had to figure things out. Like: we on the bus for three months and Mase is smoking weed every day and I am sick of smelling weed. Merce wants the bus really hot, Dave wants it really cold. But we had brotherly love.”Maseo agrees: “It’s a brother­hood, because friends fall out, perhaps for ever. But when your love is that deep, like family, you find a way to make things work out.”Trugoy’s surviving brothers feel his loss keenly, but they are adamant that De La Soul will continue. “Mase and I had a conversation, four days after Dave’s death, and we were like: ‘We can’t stop, we gotta keep pushing.’ We got so much to give – for ourselves, for our legacy, for Dave. His family were adamant: ‘If you stop, Dave stops.’” They have continued to tour as a duo, often flanked by kindred spirits such as Yasiin Bey, Talib Kweli and Dres from Black Sheep; they say new De La Soul music will come out at some point.Maseo says there have been “strong discussions” over reuniting with Prince Paul to cut new tracks, while a long-promised album with Pete Rock and DJ Premier and the unreleased third volume in the Art Official Intelligence trilogy weighted towards DJing and instrumentals – both recorded before Trugoy died – could be released. “It’s a responsibility at this point,” says Maseo. “Not just to hip‑hop, but to ourselves and Dave.”Posdnuos adds: “It might sound weird, but when I’m on stage now, Dave is on stage with me. He’s there. It took a minute to get used to not hearing his voice when I’m expecting to hear him ad lib, or his rhyme is supposed to come in, but he’s there; I feel him. And now I gotta carry the rhyme on for him, with him speaking through me.”The Grind Date is reissued on 21 March on BMGExplore more on these topicsDe La SoulHip-hopRapPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Alongside them will be sourdough and a tin of Chinese seaweed caviar decorated with the Bafta mask – and eminently repurposable as a pillbox.Hemel Hempstead chicken also comes two ways (roasted, and in a terrine) for the main, alongside scorched carrots and alyssum, while vegetarians are offered “roast crown prince (squash)” with accompaniments including a zero-waste root bhaji.The pièce de résistance is the “Bafta popcorn sundae”: a white, orange and gold-coloured chocolate tub filled with strawberry mousse and topped with salted caramel popcorn. The dessert, which may bear apassing resemblanceto a KFC bucket, can either be eaten entirely on the night or its innards scooped out and the shell retained as a souvenir.View image in fullscreenThe vegan caviar served at this year’s Baftas.Photograph: DDA PR“I imagine a lot of people will go in without a spoon,” predicts Crow of the pudding, adding that how long the container takes to melt “will depend on how warm your hands are”.Sweaty-palmed hopefuls on Sunday night include best actor nominees Adrien Brody, Timothée Chalamet and Ralph Fiennes, while Demi Moore is the frontrunner for the best actress prize.It was confirmed on Friday that Moore’s rival, disgraced Emilia Pérez star Karla Sophía Gascón, will not be attending the ceremony, although director Jacques Audiard and the rest of the cast will be in attendance.It is widely predicted Brady Corbet’s epic drama The Brutalist will clean up in the best film category, but a homegrown bias could give Edward Berger’s Conclave the edge.TheBaftasmark the last major awards ceremony to take place before Oscar voting closes on 18 February.Explore more on these topicsBaftasFoodAwards and prizesnewsShareReuse this content"

It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Saldaña] and Selena [Gomez]. And our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.”‘They chucked her under the bus – then reversed it back over her’: has the Emilia Pérez backlash gone too far?Read moreNetflix and Gascón’s personal representatives have been criticised for not spotting their client’s problematic tweets earlier. Bajaria said the episode would probably mean a change in internal policy, commenting: “I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about re-evaluating that process.”Yet she also expressed concern about the logistics of rolling out such a process. “I think you also have to [ask]: are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousands of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and license? It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.”Senior publicists expressed concern to the Guardian last week about internal handling of the affair, with some suggesting the company had abandoned its duty of care to a relative industry newcomer.They also suggested that the likely repercussions of the slip would be causing considerable headaches for Netflix staff.“If Netflix boss Ted Sarandos,” said Variety executive editor Steven Gaydos, “who’s spent millions campaigning for awards for the film, finds out this social media history was known, and not surfaced to him by anyone on his team … watch this space.”The rise and fall of Emilia Pérez: how did it all go so wrong for the Oscar-nominated film and its star?Read moreThe stars of the film have also spoken out over the past week, with Gomez telling the Santa Barbara film festival that while “some of the magic has disappeared”, she continues to be proud of the film.That sentiment was echoed by Bajaria, who said Netflix stood by its decision to acquire the film after its rapturous reception at Cannes last May. “If you asked me today, everything that I know, we would still buy the movie today,” she said. “That movie is incredible and it’s creative and it’s bold. That’s what you want. You want to take those big swings.”Gascón has repeatedly apologised for posts on her X account, which she has now deactivated. After an emotional hour-long interview on Spanish TV last weekend, the star has now said she will withdraw from the media to try to allow the film to speak for itself.Variety later reportedthat Netflix is no longer covering expenses for Gascón’s travel to awards shows; her Spanish publishers have also dropped her. On Thursday it was confirmed that she will not be attending this Sunday’s Bafta awards ceremony in London.Explore more on these topicsFilmEmilia PérezSocial mediaJacques AudiardNetflixnewsShareReuse this content"

In remarksreported by the Hollywood Reporter, Swinton took aim at the “entitled domination and the astonishing savagery of spite, state-perpetrated and internationally enabled mass murder … unacceptable to human society”.She added: “These are facts. They need to be faced. So for the sake of clarity, let’s name it. The inhumane is being perpetrated on our watch. I’m here to name it without hesitation or doubt in my mind, and to lend my unwavering solidarity to all those who recognise the unacceptable complacency of our greed-addicted governments who make nice with planet wreckers and war criminals, wherever they come from.”Swinton also made a more explicit jab at Trump’s plan to redevelop Gaza as a coastal resort, by praising independent cinema as “an unlimited realm, innately inclusive, immune to efforts of occupation, colonisation, takeover, ownership or the development of riviera property”.Swinton’s speech followeda vigil that took placeat the opening ceremony in support of Israeli actor David Cunio, who was taken hostage in the 7 October attack on Israel and is yet to be released. The festival’s artistic director Tricia Tuttle joined actors Christian Berkel, Andrea Sawatzki, and Ulrich Matthes in holding up a photo of Cunio, with a documentary about Cunio, called A Letter to David, due to receive its world premiere at the festival.Berlin’s 2024 edition was dogged by controversy over the Gaza conflict, with participants in the awards ceremonycondemning Israel and calling for a ceasefire, followed by German politicians attacking the festival and Germany’s culture minister Claudia Rothdescribing the protestsas “shockingly one-sided and characterised by deep hatred of Israel”.Tuttle later saidthat the controversy had meant that some film-makers were “questioning whether they want to come” to the festival over fears of censorship.At a press conference following her Golden Bear award, Swinton said that she had not heeded the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) campaign group’s call to boycott the festival after the 2024 protests as it would be “more useful” for her to attend. She said: “I’m a great admirer of and have a great deal of respect for BDS and I think about it a lot … I am here today – and yesterday and tomorrow and the next day – because I decided to come, I decided it was more important for me to come. I was given, thanks to the festival, a platform which I decided in a personal moment was potentially more useful to all our causes than me not turning up. It was a personal judgment call, that I take full responsibility for.”Explore more on these topicsFilmTilda SwintonBerlin film festivalFestivalsGermanynewsShareReuse this content"

The Latin script so small it can be a challenge to read and the parchment so thin that the pages have to be turned with extreme care.The Bible was created by a person known as the Sarum master or Sarum illuminator (Sarum is an early name for Salisbury) almost certainly for a wealthy individual.Anne Dutton, Salisbury Cathedral librarian, said the book was of great artistic value with huge significance to Salisbury. Over the centuries it had always been in private hands, she said, only making brief public appearances in the sale rooms of auction houses and art dealers and never going on public display.The Bible was bought last year from its previous owner bythe charity Friends of the Nations’ Libraries, which raised £90,000and donated it to the cathedral.View image in fullscreenCanon treasurer Ed Probert, librarian Dr Anne Dutton and the Very Rev Nicholas Papadopulos, dean of Salisbury, with the Sarum Master Bible.Photograph: Salisbury CathedralDutton said the Sarum master was one of the greatest artists of the time, a manuscript illuminator working in the 1240s and 1250s, with between five and seven surviving manuscripts attributed to them.“In some of these manuscripts, including our Bible, it is clear that the Sarum master is working with several assistants. This indicates the existence of a workshop. There may have been three or more artists, but it’s not clear,” Dutton said.View image in fullscreenA page from the Sarum Master Bible.Photograph: Salisbury CathedralEach book of the Sarum Master Bible begins with an intricate decorated initial. Some are ornamental; others contain human figures, frequently illustrating scenes and characters from the Bible. The initials use a rich colour palette, including a distinctive green.The work is a copy of the Vulgate Bible, which had been translated into Latin by St Jerome. It contains prefaces to many of the books of the Bible, written by St Jerome and other early theologians.It is not known who the book was made for. Dutton said: “The volume is clearly intended for private use. It’s too small to have been intended to be used in church services. It’s an expensive book, and would have been commissioned by a wealthy individual.”There was a great deal of artistic activity in Salisbury in the 13th century.The cathedral was under constructionand was being decorated with wall paintings, ceiling paintings, sculpture and stained glass. It is likely that the different artists working in the city, including the Sarum master, drew inspiration from and influenced one another.The dean of Salisbury, the Very Rev Nicholas Papadopuloss said: “It is thrilling to welcome this important and beautiful manuscript back to Salisbury and to share it with our many visitors to the cathedral.”The Sarum Master Bible will go on display atSalisbury Cathedralfrom 28 February to 20 March.Explore more on these topicsThe BibleHeritageChristianityWiltshireAnglicanismReligion (Books)Religion (World news)featuresShareReuse this content"

On Friday morning, a small number of Creative Australia staff in the Sydney office walked out in protest.The award-winning artist and Dagostino were announced last week as thesuccessful team for the 2026 Biennaleon the advice of a panel of independent industry advisers.But after a late-night board meeting on Thursday, Creative Australia took the unprecedented step todump the team after criticism of Sabsabi’s artby The Australian newspaper and the shadow arts minister, Claire Chandler.In a statement they said: “The board of Creative Australia has made the unanimous decision not to proceed with the artistic team chosen for the Venice Biennale 2026. Creative Australia is an advocate for freedom of artistic expression and is not an adjudicator on the interpretation of art.“However, the board believes a prolonged and divisive debate about the 2026 selection outcome poses an unacceptable risk to public support for Australia’s artistic community and could undermine our goal of bringing Australians together through art and creativity.”Guardian Australia understands that Larissa Behrendt was the only board member not present for the unanimous decision.On Friday the arts minister, Tony Burke, said: “By law I don’t have the power to direct Creative Australia – and did not.”“They have made their decisions and they’ve put their reasons out there.“I’ve always been supportive of Creative Australia.”Staff involved in the 2026 Venice Biennale organisation were only told of the board decision at the same time Creative Australia made a public announcement, late on Thursday.On Friday, Australia’s peak advocacy body for contemporary Australian artists condemned Creative Australia’s decision.The executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts (Nava), Penelope Benton, called it “deeply troubling”.At the core of the controversy is Sabsabi’s 2007 video installation titled You, which includes images of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.The artist donated the work to Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) in 2009.Benton said the work exemplified Sabsabi’s ability to contextualise contested histories and challenge dominant narratives.Khaled Sabsabi never thought he’d be Australia’s pick for the Venice Biennale - podcastRead moreThe gallery that has represented Sabsabi for more than a decade, Brisbane’s Milani Gallery, called for the artist to be reinstated as Australia’s representative in Venice in 2026.The Western Sydney Arts Alliance also called for the artist’s immediate reinstatement, a formal apology and for Creative Australia to provide full transparency around the decision-making process.Guardian Australia contacted several members of the board for comment.– With Steph HarmonExplore more on these topicsVenice BiennalenewsShareReuse this content"

These include “models of vehicles”, “computer programmes and electronic comic books”, “electronic publishing” and design, encompassing uses such as restaurants, cocktail lounge services and accommodation.The claims were made by Kleindienst, founder of the Kleindienst Group which claims to be the largest European property developer in the United Arab Emirates.A spokesperson for Kleindienst confirmed that the businessman has plans to utilise the Bond name if he wins his challenge, and that an “announcement is coming soon”.The EU cancellation actions were filed on 27 January. While no date is provided for the timing of the filing of the UK actions, they are also likely to have been made recently as the cases are listed as “awaiting defence”.The James Bond trademarks are officially registered to US-based company Danjaq, which controls the rights to worldwide traditional James Bond merchandising in conjunction with Eon.Eon, the UK-based production company responsible for turning Ian Fleming’s James Bond into one of the most successful film franchises in history, is run by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson, who are fiercely protective of the intellectual property rights associated with 007.Danjaq also co-owns the copyright to the existing James Bond films, along with MGM Studios, which wasacquired by Amazon for $8.5bn in 2021– the same year the last outing of the franchise, No Time to Die, hit cinemas.“Following the date of the filing of the cancellations Danjaq has two months to submit their defence,” says Caddle. “If Danjaq want to keep these alive they will need to engage in a trademark office action to show that they have used James Bond in the areas being challenged in the last five years.”James Bond is also likely to be trademarked in the United Arab Emirates, where Kleindienst operates his property business and where the filings list his residence as a hotel, but the trademark office there is not readily publicly accessible to be able to ascertain whether similar cancellation claims have been made.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In any case, Danjaq would certainly counter-challenge. James Bond is still well used and loved. I don’t think that route would be straightforward for him [even if he were to win].”Eon and Danjaq were contacted for comment.‘Bond’s audience will be patient’: Amazon MGM Studios’ boss on the hunt for a new 007Read moreMeanwhile, the ongoing saga ofwho will replace Daniel Craigas the next James Bond and when the next film will be announced rumbles on. More than three years on from his final appearance as 007, fans are no closer to knowing who his replacement will be.Articles have suggestedthat Broccoli, who along with Wilson maintains strict control over the film franchise and who plays Bond, did not hit it off with Amazon executives after the deal to buy MGM.In an interview with the Guardian last year, Jennifer Salke, the global head of Amazon MGM Studios, played down reports she got on the wrong side of Broccoli for raising the idea of a Bond TV series.“We have a good and close relationship with Eon and Barbara and Michael,” said Salke. “We are not looking to disrupt the way those wonderful films are made. For us, we are taking their lead. The global audience will be patient. We don’t want too much time between films, but we are not concerned at this point.”Explore more on these topicsJames BondIntellectual propertyDubaiEuropean UnionFilm industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Their voices bring an unparalleled authenticity to the music.“They all have their own individual, often atonal melodies but when you put a flute against a red-breasted nuthatch, for example, the synergy is amazing. I picked out sounds that I felt were the soloists, like the wolves, and others that were more atmospheric, like the wild winds of Antarctica, and treated them in a similar way to a trombone or a guitar … The wolves are howling with great soul, great passion, and accompanied by a trombone following their line. It’s jazz, the jazz wolf of the Arctic tundra.”Wild Concerto is inspired by the remarkable migration of the Arctic tern from pole to pole, and some of the birds and animals possibly encountered along the way.View image in fullscreenWild ConcertoPhotograph: Archie BrooksbankThere is an environmental theme to the work, Stewart said. “Many of these species are endangered and their sounds could vanish in our lifetime. Through the Wild Concerto, their voices are immortalised.”Over six decades, he has captured the sounds of the natural world, from lush rainforests to remote Arctic tundras – sounds that have been heard in natural history series such as Our Oceans and Blue Planet as well as about 150 films, including Cold Mountain and Frozen.With an archive of almost 100,000 recordings from more than 60 countries, he has been described as the David Attenborough of sound.Stewart said: “I was so sceptical about sticking natural sounds with music. So many saunas and salons play new age music with pianos and oceans and I thought that’s what it was going to sound like. But I was just gobsmacked. Stewart [Copeland] is a brilliant talent. He’s combined natural sounds and music seamlessly. This is another avenue for people to listen to nature. It’s giving the animals another voice.”View image in fullscreenMartyn Stewart said the album immortalised the sounds of many animals who are endangered.Photograph: Archie BrooksbankHe hopes the album will raise awareness of creatures that are extinct, endangered or so affected by noise pollution that their sounds cannot be captured cleanly. “Two-thirds of the species in my library are now basically extinct. Twenty-five or 30 years ago, when I wanted to record one pristine hour of sound, it took about three or four hours to do that with minimal editing. Today, if I want to record an hour’s pristine sound, it takes about 2,000 hours to get that because there are so many manmade sounds in the environment … There’s about 10 endangered species on the album … poison dart frogs, wolves, Galápagos tortoise.”For Copeland, the idea of using sounds from the animal kingdom was “immediately intriguing”. He recalled his first film score for Francis Ford Coppola, Rumble Fish, and Oliver Stone’s Wall Street, where his sounds included dogs barking and billiard balls clacking.In avideo filmed at Abbey Road Studio, Copeland says: “As I’m composing these sounds, I’m very aware of Martyn out there on his hands and knees in the deepest jungles getting bitten by tsetse fly, black mamba, tarantula, because he has to go far away because of sound pollution … to get this incredible library of sound.”Stewart donated his entire archive tothe Listening Planet, a charity he co-founded with his niece Amanda Hill, which celebrates biodiversity, advocates for conservation, and “reminds the world why nature’s voice is worth listening to”.Wild Concertois released by Platoon Records on 18 April. Copeland willjoin fellow composer Arash Safaian at Kings Place, London, on Earth Day, 22 April,to discuss the compositionand the wider relationship between music and nature,before his nationwide tour.A track from the album,White Throated Sparrow (Is Happy On the Glacier),can be heard here.This article was amended on 14 February 2025 to correct the spelling of Arash Safaian’s surname, and to add information about the donation of Martyn Stewart’s archive to the Listening Planet charity.Explore more on these topicsMusicWildlifeBirdsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a human thing, very natural.”Her images focus onArbor Low, a stone circle high in the Peak District in Derbyshire. They capture people gathering to take part in celebrations and to meditate. In one photograph a woman bangs a drum at the stones; in another a man holds an Egyptian carving of a serpent to the sun.“Arbor Low has been a gathering place for thousands of years,” Hou said. “It is a living space. When I was there I felt like it’s really a safe space for everybody to find solace.”View image in fullscreenImage by the artist Serena Burgis titled Mama on the Hilltop that is part of the Echoes: Stone Circles, Community and Heritage photography exhibition at Stonehenge.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThe EnglishHeritageprehistorian Jennifer Wexler said there had been a noticeable rise in people visiting stone circles after the Covid crisis and as concerns about global issues such as the climate emergency have increased.She said: “Stone circles connect the past with the present, linking personal histories to community and memory to belonging. These sites continue to inspire us as symbols of connection, belonging and meaning.”The British-Thai artistSerena Burgis, 24, from Dorset, produced striking images of theKingston Russell stone circle,where she spent a lot of time with her British father as a child.View image in fullscreenAn image by artist Sally Barton titled Offerings.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianShe said she found it a very “English” space but for this project worked closely with her Thai mother and other women from the local south-east Asian community, photographing them at the site.Burgis said: “Most of them had never been there so it was really fun. We had picnics, which is obviously a very English thing to do, but also a very Thai thing. There’s something about sitting on the earth, sharing food together.”The artists had been invited to take photographs of any free English Heritage sites but all, by coincidence, chose to turn their gaze on stone circles.Burgis said she felt stone circles were part of everyone’s history, rather than an elite few. “There can be something humble about them. They’re not a castle, not a wealthy place. They’re for everyone.”View image in fullscreen‘Stone circles bring people together’: Yuxi Hou, with some of her photography.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThe third artist,Sally Barton, 25, from Sheffield, was inspired by the Nine Ladies stone circle, also in the Peak District.One of her images has been presented as a version of a trade union banner, a nod to her family’s links to the Labour party. Another shows a set of goalposts decorated with ribbons. “Football is a ritual to many people,” she said.For Barton, the Nine Ladies circle was one of her beloved playgrounds when she was young and she worked with local primary school children for some of her pictures in the exhibition. “I wanted to remind children local to the site that the stones are theirs.”The exhibition, Echoes: Stone Circles, Community and Heritage, is part of a wider collaboration between English Heritage’s national youth engagement programme,Shout Out Loud, and the international platformPhotoworks. It opens on Saturday 15 February and runs until Sunday 7 September 2025 at the Stonehenge visitor centre.Explore more on these topicsHeritagePhotographyStonehengeDorsetDerbyshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Veteran German director Tom Tykwer has created a heavy-footed magical-realist romp lasting two hours and 40 minutes about a complicated extended family in Berlin whose painful lives are turned around by a magic refugee whose purpose is to salvage their happiness. The film twice uses Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody to provide a jukebox blast of energy – the second time at the very end, worryingly indicating that the classic track is being brought on to save the day because the film is out of ideas.Lars Eidinger gives a muscular, unselfconscious performance as Tim, a thoroughly modern cool dad who writes advertising copy for environmentally conscious brands, cycles everywhere in the driving rain and has a disconcerting habit of stripping naked when he gets back to his bohemian apartment. Nicolette Krebitz plays his wife, Milena, who is trying to establish a community theatre in Africa with a German government grant. But their teen children, eco-protester Frieda (Elke Biesendorfer), who has just had an abortion, and VR gamer nerd Jon (Julius Gause) are unhappy. There is also Dio (Elyas Eldridge), Milena’s son by Godfrey (Toby Onwumere), with whom she co-parents.When their cleaning lady drops dead one day in their kitchen, a very peculiar thigh-slapper of a comic moment that is evidently intended to satirise (and yet also ultimately forgive) their entitled prosperous arrogance, the family has to get someone else in; this is Syrian refugee Farrah (Tala Al Deen), who is wise and all-knowing, with a private grief in her own life.Farrah turns the family on to an experimental treatment for depression: a throbbing, flashing light you gaze into that helps your body to release endorphins. Tim’s family are coming into mystic alignment with Farrah’s …There is quite a bit of energy in this film, but it’s shapeless and undirected, and seems to be making an unearned claim on our affectionate regard for how chaotically adorable and yet meaningful the whole thing is. The final sequence, though initially very striking, raises serious ideas and moods which the film itself is unable to absorb.Das Licht (The Light) screened at theBerlin film festival.Explore more on these topicsBerlin film festivalDrama filmsGermanyComedy filmsRefugeesComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The neck is a dead giveaway. Our faces are lies and our necks are the truth. You have to cut open a redwood tree to see how old it is, but you wouldn’t have to if it had a neck.”This sharply funny essay collection was a hit for theWhen Harry Met Sallywriter who famously maintained “everything is copy”. Along with bemoaning the state of her neck, she reflects on her culinary misadventures, an underwhelming encounter with JFK, and the state of women’s handbags with their “morass of loose Tic Tacs, solitary Advils, lipsticks without tops, ChapSticks of unknown vintage, little bits of tobacco even though there has been no smoking going on for at least 10 years”. There are titbits of wisdom, too, among them: “Anything you think is wrong with your body at the age of 35, you will be nostalgic for at the age of 45.”This is an old recording, made when the book was first published in 2006 and unavailable in the UK – until now. Gloriously, Ephron is the narrator because who else could do her fiercely candid and funny prose justice? It also features an introduction, written and narrated by theEverything I Know About Lovewriter Dolly Alderton, which pays adoring tribute to Ephron’s “bold truth-telling”.Available via Penguin Audio, 3hr 58minFurther listeningHow Good It Is I Have No Fear of DyingLara Marlowe,Apollo, 8hr 32minReporter Lara Marlowe narrates her book documenting the experiences of 29-year-old Yulia Mykytenko, an army officer fighting on the Ukrainian frontline.WantGillian Anderson,Bloomsbury, 12hrThis compendium of essays detailing the sexual fantasies of anonymous women from around the world is collated, edited and narrated by the actor.Explore more on these topicsBooksAudiobook of the weekEssaysNora EphronAudiobooksreviewsShareReuse this content"

His parable about a priest suspected of abuse was, he has said, partly prompted by the search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq: war justified by unproven conviction. He depicts a 1960s Bronx school where Sister Aloysius (Maxine Peake), implacable school principal, insists that Father Flynn (Ben Daniels) has behaved inappropriately towards Donald, the school’s sole Black student – yet she lacks evidence.Peake maintains a beady eye and ramrod straight spine. Her deep, rustbucket voice of judgment is cut with a squeal of contempt. Daniels leans into his twinkle. His sermons sound like a hand extended to the congregation; his vestment gleams a verdant green. Her starch meets his charisma; dogged belief confronts impassioned rebuttal.Shanley sets his play precisely in 1964 – pop culture and protest will soon ignite the US, yet the school appears impervious to change. On Peter McKintosh’s inhospitable set, its walls a grim charcoal, only a leafless branch and bare swathe of earth hint at autumn.View image in fullscreenLeaning into his twinkle … Ben Daniels as Father Flynn in Doubt.Photograph: Simon AnnandLindsay Posner’s emphatic production is finely cast, but as the play reaches its pointy confrontations, he has the actors slow down and shout it out. Thumpity argument is effective, but Shanley’s play could be more spry and guileful. An earlier scene has greater spark – Flynn slipping into the principal’s chair as if by right, a convivial atmosphere suddenly bristling.The Catholic church’s cruel mishandling of abuse has only become more evident since Doubt premiered – though we now try to foreground survivors. Shanley doesn’t bring Donald on stage (nor does the boy accuse Flynn) – rather, we see his mother (Rachel John, poised and wary) with her own reasons for not joining Sister Aloysius’ crusade.Sister James (Holly Godliman, excellent), the young nun who first raises suspicions, loses sleep and peace of mind. Doubt prowls around the mess of human motive. “Things are in the air and you leave them alone if you can,” declares Donald’s mother – but how do you live with the things you’d rather not know?AtUstinov Studio, Bath, until 8 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreMaxine PeakeTheatre Royal BathreviewsShareReuse this content"

Nothing lasts forever though. Maybe we’re already in a bizarro era of war as peace and ignorance as strength. It may explain whyBartees Strange, the queer American rocker known for anarchic, genre-mashing indie, is now produced byJack Antonoff, whose aesthetic is earnest, playlist-friendly craftsmanship. The results are frustrating. Nearly every one of these 12 tracks has something to commend, but there’s a persistent inability to spin fleeting moments into a compelling song.The spectre of Yves Tumor’s solipsistic rhapsodies hangs overHorror, but painted in a timid shade. The quiet-LOUD-quiet trick is played repeatedly, although there’s little reward in taking savage left turns if you always end up in the same place. It doesn’t help that Strange’s squalling guitar is erratically mixed: onWants Needsit hints at peak Thurston Moore, but it’s far too attenuated on Sober. Baltimore is better, the tension between its pugnacious, distorted solo and Strange’s vulnerable introspection playing well. And the gloriously savage Prince-at-CBGB Loop Defenders is a treat.Horrormay be uneven, but Strange will always be worth another try – unlike other American experiments.Watch the video for Sober by Bartees Strange.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockThe ObserverIndiereviewsShareReuse this content"

Using Arabic quarter-tone scales with guitar, horns and traditional percussion such as the darbuka drum, Ahmed’s music is a fiery blend of instinctive soloing with melodic lyricism. While 2019’s Polyhymnia took inspiration from formidable women such as Saudi Arabian film-maker Haifaa al-Mansour, Ahmed’s fourth album turns towards folk traditions to produce 10 tracks of atmospheric intensity.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for A Paradise in the HoldDrawing on the polyrhythmic Arab sea-musicfijiriand wedding poetry, the album marks the first time Ahmed has collaborated with other singers. On opener She Stands on the Shore, vocalist Natacha Atlas’s warm tenor interweaves seamlessly with Ahmed’s plaintive trumpet melody, swelling over bowed bass to evoke the undulating waves, while Randolph Matthews’ lower register on To the Lonely Sea artfully embodies an eerie sense of hard winds and crashing waves.Some features are less effective, with the droning bass of Though My Eyes Go to Sleep, My Heart Does Not Forget You jarring against Alba Nacinovich’s keening melody, and the group vocalisations of Al Naddaha struggling to be heard amid Ahmed’s doubling trumpet lines. Instead, Ahmed excels when her compositions play fast and free. The fierce polyrhythms of wedding song Her Light spiral into an ecstatic dance, while the joyous Into the Night features Ahmed’s extended family performing traditional ululations and hand-clapping to continue the sense of celebration.The 10-minute title track is another highlight. Pearl-diving music is an a cappella vocal tradition for guiding ship workers by blending rhythmic droning with high-register melody, and Ahmed uses a processed sample of one such performance to build a vamping groove alongside bass clarinettist George Crowley’s expressive solo and percussionist Corrina Silvester’s extended darbuka break. The effect is infectiously jubilant, drawing the listener into Ahmed’s distinct and modern imagining of Bahraini tradition.Released on 28 February.Also out this monthReunion Island producerJako Maron’s latest album,Mahavélouz(Nyege Nyege Tapes) is a thumping techno odyssey centred on the country’s stringed bobre instrument. Blending processed kick drums with the bobre’s harsh twang, tracks like Zésprimaron are invigoratingly loud, channelling the raw chaos of 90s rave-era Prodigy. Korean instrumentalistPark Jihacontinues her exploration of traditional instruments such as the piri and saenghwang to produce expansive ambient soundscapes onAll Living Things (Glitterbeat). Showcasing a more intricate compositional style, heavily layered tracks like Grounding and A Story of Little Birds are beautifully enveloping.

In any other year a film about two snipers holding guard over an abyss filled with monsters wouldn’t feel like standard date night fare but there are more traditional romcom beats here than one would expect and ultimately want.Captain America: Brave New World review – Harrison Ford juggles green screens, red fists and vanilla plottingRead moreWhen the film, from The Black Phone and Doctor Strange director Scott Derrickson, starts off in genre territory, there’s some low-level fun to be had. The setup has a non-triggering Covid-era feel to it, as Miles Teller’s soldier-for-hire Levi finds himself an unlikely new gig, spending the next year alone in a watchtower. In a brief handover from an underused Sope Dirisu, playing his predecessor, he’s told that the gorge beneath him must be guarded not from those trying to get in but holding strong against whatever might come out. He suggests it’s the gates of hell.But before we get a chance to find out, very soon into Levi’s 12-month shift, he spots Drasa, his slinky Lithuanian equivalent played byAnya Taylor-Joy, over the gorge. The duties are split up by countries from the east and west, inserting what could have been a neat tension similar to that introduced in last year’s space station-set thriller ISS, but instead … hormones. He’s horny and she’s hot, so the pair start breaking the rules by communicating via adorkably annoying written messages as if they’re characters in an early 2000s Sundance movie. Here’s where the good will of the setup starts to dissipate as the pair risk life and limb for date night, him zip-lining over the gorge so he can eat her homemade rabbit pie as they dreamily stare out into the eerie clouds ahead of them. Predictably, taking a break from keeping watch over some unspecified inferno, along with playing loud music to each other over the mist, is not a good idea and the pair find themselves besieged.There’s an inevitable set of dim-witted circumstances that soon drops them into the gorge where they find some sub-Annihilation production design and we find that things aren’t exactly what they seem. Well, plot-wise they mostly are, a thinly sketched conspiracy involving Sigourney Weaver’s shadowy recruiter unfolding in exactly the way we expect. The real big reveal is that despite looking like it was based on a video game that your younger brother obsessively plays, The Gorge is in fact an original, or whatever that word means when the plot and aesthetic feel like they’ve been stitched together from so many other films. It plays like a particularly unexciting Resident Evil sequel with the pair trying to outrun some unimpressive twig creatures and remain uninfected while finding out information from point-and-click sources.Screenwriter Zach Dean, whose credits include The Tomorrow War and Fast X, wildly overestimates our investment in the central romance, bravely centre-staging it despite giving us no reason to root or care for the couple. There could have been something darkly funny about a pair of sociopathic killers getting hot and heavy while bonding over the ruthlessness of their profession but, instead, they’re boringly haunted by it, hoping the other one might save them. Both actors are in full, show-me-the-money autopilot mode, flatly flirting with such lack of passion it feels as if their real-life partners are awkwardly watching off-camera, Taylor-Joy particularly inert as Manic Pixie Dream Sniper.There are touches of above-average streaming craft here, distancing it from the standard Netflix equivalent – an indistinctive yet solid score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, some grand cinematography from Guillermo del Toro fave Dan Laustsen – but the film bears too much of that synthetic Apple feel, as if it was primarily made to show off the abilities of a new iPhone. Given how so many of the company’s streaming shows and films are barely marketed, The Gorge feels like another one that will easily, and deservedly, disappear into the abyss.The Gorge is now available on Apple TVExplore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsHorror filmsAnya Taylor-JoyApple TV+Romance filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It took a girls’ high school football team, crashed their plane in a mysterious wilderness, and teased viewers with their eventual descent into sacrifice and cannibalism. That, alone, would have sustained most shows. But Yellowjackets divided itself in two and added a retro twist. The wilderness, flesh-eating years were flashbacks to the 90s, while it added an outer coating of the survivors as they are now, in their 40s, still trying to cover up what they did when stranded. It had an outstandingly culty cast, including Juliette Lewis, Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci, and above all, it was a lot of fun.But the second season faltered slightly and seemed unsure what to do with its own success. It lurched forward, but the plot became circular, and began to eat its own tail; whole episodes passed without shifting things in any significant direction. And then, with a typical flourish of excess, it set fire to the past and the future. In the wilderness, it burned down the cabin in the woods where the girls (and Travis) had been sheltering; in the present, it unexpectedly killed off one of its big-name leads. Yellowjackets may have taken its time to get there, but boy did it get there – and with panache to spare.It returns having undergone a necessary reset. Based on the four episodes available in advance, in taking a torch to things, it appears to have rediscovered that initial anarchic energy. It is funny and zingy, and occasionally scary, too. In the wilderness, still miraculously alive and even more miraculously undiscovered, the group has made it to spring. The chill and hunger of winter have abated, meaning they no longer have to eat the frozen corpses of their teammates. At least, not for now, but these girls are not quitters!Following Lottie’s lead, they create their own pagan-ish faith and rituals, to give thanks for their survival. It all goes a bit Midsommar via Glastonbury festival. Some of the girls are onboard with this. Young Shauna (Sophie Nélisse), whose viciousness has been building since the beginning, is emphatically not onboard with this, not least because her dead baby plays a significant part in the group’s ceremonial posturing. Meanwhile, Coach Ben (Steven Krueger) is still missing and suspected of arson and attempted murder. Poor old Travis (Kevin Alves) is being coerced into taking mushrooms by Lottie (Courtney Eaton), who sees him as a visionary, and some of the peripheral cast, who barely got a word in early on, are starting to play a bigger role. “What, do you like, actually have a personality?” says Shauna, a knowing nod to the new-ish Yellowjackets’ move into the spotlight.View image in fullscreen‘Panache to spare’ … Yellowjackets season three.Photograph: Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIMEIts sense of humour is definitely back, too, which is a relief for a show about teenage cannibalism. In the present day, one of the best running gags is that Shauna (Lynskey) is now a suburban mum and wife, who has mundane household chores to do. Yet she was the butcher in the wilderness, and her bloodthirstiness hasn’t gone anywhere. Watching her kick against domestic obligations is a treat. Meanwhile, adult Misty (Ricci) is reeling from the events of the season two finale, and is questioning whether the group really sees her as a friend, while trying out a hilarious new identity. Van (Lauren Ambrose) and Taissa (Tawny Cypress) are bringing the horror, as their rekindled relationship enters creepy waters. Newcomer Hilary Swank will join the cast later in the run.After four episodes, it isn’t clear whether Yellowjackets has entirely shrugged off the issues of season two. The survivors must be about halfway through their ordeal in the woods, but it is hard to say whether it has regained that sense of momentum, or whether it still feels as if they’re making it up as they go along. It does appear to have seen the need for a coherent thread to tie everything together, and is giving it a go, while simultaneously twirling that thread around in the air like a big camp lasso, grabbing anything it brushes past. It might take the whole season to work out if it has grabbed anything useful. Yellowjackets remains witty, self-aware television. The soundtrack is great, it dares to wander off into long, hallucinogenic dream-like sequences, and you’re never quite sure who is going to make it out alive (in the present day, at least). Even if they are winging it plot-wise, it’s hard to care too much, when it’s as enjoyable as this.Yellowjackets is on Paramount+ now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s never subtle – Miekelson’s performatively woke, Just Stop Oil-supporting daughter, for example, feels straight out of central casting – but it confidently hits its broad sitcom beats.BBC iPlayer, from Thursday20 FebruaryReacherView image in fullscreenThe ultraviolent lunkhead is back … Alan Ritchson in Reacher season three.Photograph: Jasper Savage/PrimeTV’s alpha male, ultraviolent lunkhead returns and nothing much has changed:Jack Reacheris casually shattering the nose of a sleazebag in a cafe, literally in between sips of coffee.

When teenager Johanna’s best friend is killed, the community’s suspicion immediately falls upon her. There’s clearly a ritual element to the killing, so Johanna’s teen-goth awkwardness is interpreted as a red flag. It’s an odd genre mashup of Scandi noir and YA melodrama from the Walter Presents strand, which uses the icy harshness of its setting to tense and frequently gory effect.Channel 4, from Thursday20 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingDramafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Jagged battlements and conical heaps stretch to the horizon.At the base of these cliffs stands a cluster of large, elegant houses. This is Melnik, Bulgaria’s smallest town, with just 194 residents. Despite its diminutive size, the town is famous as the heart of Bulgaria’s wine region. Every year, on 14 February, thousands of visitors arrive for Saint Trifon’s Day, a celebration of the patron saint of winemaking, which is a much bigger deal than Valentine’s Day, and dates back centuries.The festivities begin when the wineries in the surrounding hills open their doors to visitors for tastings of the local red wine, but soon take on the atmosphere of a village fete when meat is thrown on the grill, and bagpipes, drums and fiddles strike up. Women in traditional dress lead ahoro, a Bulgarian folk dance where the dancers link hands and move in winding lines. From here, the party moves on to the taverns in Melnik, which fill to the rafters, the noise growing proportionately to the number of jugs of house wine consumed – which is quite a few since they start at about £10 a litre. Soon, everyone is dancing again as an impromptuhoroweaves between the tables and chairs.View image in fullscreenWomen in traditional dress lead a folk dance.Photograph: Niko LatrenchevFor most of the year, however, Melnik is a peaceful place. Two weeks before the festivities begin, I arrive for my fourth visit to the town and, as usual, I have barely stepped out of the car when I am called over by a man selling wine.“You have to try it. I made it,” he says, pouring me a glass of red from a two-litre plastic bottle. It is pleasantly sweet and easy to drink, but it makes navigating the cobblestones harder as I climb a sidestreet between old stone houses.The party moves on to the taverns in Melnik, which fill to the rafters, the noise growing proportionately to the number of jugs of house wine consumedMost of Melnik’s buildings date back to a time known as theNational Revival, in the 18th and 19th centuries. Despite still being under Ottoman rule, Bulgarian writers and revolutionaries led a movement to promote patriotism, sparking a revival of local culture. Wealthy merchant families built their homes in a distinctive style, with overhanging upper floors, large windows and intricate decor. One of the best-preserved,Kordopulov House, is open to visitors. It looms over the road below, made to draw traders’ eyes. Following in their footsteps, I enter a large reception hall with stained glass windows. Next door is a chamber for private dealings, with a secret room hidden behind some bookshelves. The whole family could sit here to listen in on trade deals.View image in fullscreenMavrud, a wine supposedly favored by Churchill, is available for tasting at the Melnik Wine Museum.Photograph: Eloise StarkMany similar buildings now sit empty in the town. During the Ottoman era, Melnik was a major trading hub, and most of its population was Greek. In 1912 the town was incorporated into the newly founded Bulgaria, and a year later the Greek government ordered Melnik’s Hellenic community to relocate across the border, just 30km away. There is a disproportionate grandeur to these large empty houses, as though skyscrapers had been left behind in a village. They look out on to quiet streets, and the only merchants left are the ones selling wine and jam to tourists.The entrance fee to the wine museum includes tasting a variety supposedly favoured by Winston Churchill, who was said to order two barrels each yearBack on the main street, I follow a sign to theWine Museum, where information panels formatted as old scrolls and archive photos of winemakers line the walls. Wine has a long history here, dating back to the Thracians, who inhabited the region from about 1,000BC to the sixth century AD. According to the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder, the first European wine grower was a Thracian named Evmolp, and Thracian wines are mentioned in Homer’s epics.The small exhibit serves as a cultural alibi for the museum’s tasting section, where large barrels await. The £4.50 entrance ticket includes five wine tastings, including a variety supposedly favoured by Winston Churchill, who was said to order two barrels each year. Locals love the tale, even if there’s no hard evidence.“Winston Leonard … What comes next?” asks the museum guide. “Erm … Henry?” I offer. “Spencer! Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill,” he says, handing me a glass of red mavrud, Churchill’s alleged favourite tipple. I see why he might have liked it. It has hints of tobacco, as though I was smoking a cigar while drinking.View image in fullscreenIvan, a guide at Melnik's Wine Museum, places a label on a  bottle.Photograph: Eloise StarkBut my favourite is a rosé made from a local grape calledsiroka melniska(broad-leaved melnik). It is light and fruity, and reminds me of fizzy fish sweets – apologies to wine connoisseurs. I ask for a bottle to take home. The guide fills it from the barrel, puts a cork in it, melts wax on top and hands it to me with a flourish.At dinner, sitting at a wooden table outside amehana, or tavern, the smell of grilled meats fills the air, but I order a vegetable stew with slices of aubergine that melt in my mouth, alongside Bulgarian flatbread with paprika and cheese. Dessert is homemade ice-cream with caramelised nuts and candied figs.Melnik is falling into a sleepy torpor when I leave shortly after sunset. It will need all of its energy come 14 February, when visitors from throughout Bulgaria arrive to pay tribute to Saint Trifon. How he earned the title of the patron saint of winemaking is a mystery. Little is known of Saint Trifon other than the fact he was beheaded in the year 250 for being a Christian. Bulgarians have filled in the gaps with little regard for chronological consistency, however. Local lore states that Trifon was the Virgin Mary’s brother. Carrying a newly born Jesus, Mary passed the saint tending his vineyard, and he yelled after her: “Where are you taking that bastard?” With those charming words, he swung his scythe and accidentally cut off his nose.Today, the festival is more about wine than about the saint, affectionately nicknamedbeznos, or noseless. It is also, increasingly, about love. When I attended last year, I asked a young couple drinking wine in a spa hotel whether they were there for Saint Trifon’s or Valentine’s Day. “Both,” they replied. After all, wine and romance are a perfect pairing.Eloise stayed at Hotel Melnik, which hasdouble rooms from£49 (115BGN)a night,hotelmelnik.comExplore more on these topicsBulgaria holidaysValentine's DayEurope holidaysWine holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No, it’s “a journey of the senses”, over tandoori duck seekh kebab, sea basspollichathuand a few fancy cocktails, to help you transcend your earthly confines. This is “more than just a meal; it’s an ascent to new experiences”, proclaims the website.Being a huge fan of restauranthyperbole, I love it when dinner promises to change me metaphysically. The website goes on to refer to Vatavaran’s owners, chef Rohit Ghai and Abhishake Sangwan, as “visionary”, and in doing so strays perilously close toDavid Icketerritory. Elsewhere on the site, Himalayan analogies are stretched like climbing ropes off the side ofNanda Devi: the show kitchen private dining room, we are told, is “a dynamic, participatory journey through the flavours of the mountains”, but I’d rather not –PDRsare the last refuge of the scoundrel, after all.View image in fullscreen‘Peculiar’: Vatavaran’s indori poha chaat.Vatavaran is on multiple levels in a gargantuan, higgledy-piggledy former cocktail bar on Beauchamp Place; one server informed me randomly as I entered that “the loos are in the basement”, clearly preempting my later lostness. A great deal has been spent on abstract art and fancy wallpaper to make the place look pretty, though if this clonking behemoth of real estate were in Huddersfield rather than Knightsbridge, it would make a pretty good Wetherspoons. The menu, meanwhile, may claim to cover the Indian subcontinent, but the likes of beetroot chops and kidney bean kebabs seem far more modern and experimental than wildly authentic.The main dining room was a bit chilly, and our table for two was blasted further by an aircon vent that helpfully rearranged my fringe while I ate a stale trio of poppadoms with pleasant mango and tamarind chutneys; a whole £7 was added to our bill for that particular treat. At first, we were the only guests, but our server was flummoxed even by that. What puzzled me more, however, was the large, apparently out-of-operation cocktail bar through which all our food emerged. Was there a dumb waiter behind it, delivering plates up from the bowels of the building? At any rate, there was no smell of cooking at all, so for all I knew they were maybe ordering things in on Deliveroo.Two plates appeared over on the bar: first, that kidney-bean kebab, which turned out to be minced, unseasoned beans shaped into a patty, fried and garnished with cremated lotus root. It was grimly edible, but only if you wereveryhungry. Then a bowl of peculiarindori pohachaatin which wet, structureless dumplings were hidden in a tamarind sauce. Not offensive, but also not all that nice, either.Our table for two was blasted by an aircon vent that helpfully rearranged my fringe as I ate a stale trio of poppadomsAnother small plate arrived,dal bati, a mixed lentil dal with hard bread balls. Bati should err on the chewy, but these were largely inedible and the haphazardly seasoned dal felt as if it had recently been reheated. Was there even a chef in the building? Granted, the earlier overcooked lotus root did suggest that someone, somewhere, had access to a fryer. I wrapped my scarf up tight and gestured amiably at the servers, pointing them to the air-conditioning unit that was still piping cold air at my neck. They looked at me blankly, without being quite able to crack my code.Two prettily presented non-alcoholic cocktails appeared with a flourish, so they clearly had a bartender in the house – atejwithTajín, passionfruit and grapefruit, and a delicatetulsimade with cucumber, lemongrass, basil and apple. If only such artistry had extended to anything in the dining room. By this point in our meal, the place had started to fill with what seemed to be rich tourists pointed here by posh local hotels. “Save yourselves!” I stopped myself from shouting. “Run!”View image in fullscreen‘Cremated’: Vatavaran’s lotus kidney kebab.Fancy-pants places such as this make me rather irate, because they exist largely only in the meetings before their opening dates. “Behold, our extremely lofty cookery. Customers will be jolly happy to have us.” But by the time our mains arrived, I had lost all impetus for eating. A £24 tandoori lamb chop with black cumin was spongey, overcooked and suspiciously un-tandoored: there was no discernible charcoal smell, nor that unmistakable scent of sizzling lamb fat. Butter chicken, by contrast, was a safer option, and a welcome one, because it had a pleasing and vibrant sunset-coloured sauce finished with fenugreek. The accompanying roti, on the other hand, were stale and unlovable.I pondered a lot about Vatavaran in the days after our visit. Was there anything else I should have ordered? Fish cooked on a rotisserie (or so the menu said), or the lobstermoilee? Then again, if even your dal is uninspiring, there’s no way I’m chancing you making a decent coconut-cream sauce to go with lobster. TLDR: Vatavaran may be a Himalayan dining experience, but I’d rather be rescued from the Mera Peak with missing toes than eat there again.Vatavaran14-15 Beauchamp Place, London SW3, 020-4618 3971.

Not in an annoying mini-mic-on-the-high-street kind of way, but, rather, I ask everyone from taxi drivers and hairdressers to fellow drinks enthusiasts about what they’re drinking. I recently asked a shop manager what he thought of South African wine, and he responded by throwing his hands in the air and exclaiming: “Eurgh! I can’tstandpinotage!”The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This cross between pinot noir and cinsault was developed in South Africa, and it’s the country’s signature grape variety, but its reputation for conjuring notes of burnt rubber and paint has, I fear, tarnished the rest of the country’s wine output. Which is a crying shame, considering how much else there is to be delighted by.I recently spent some time in and around Cape Town, where the first vines were planted in 1655 by the colonising Dutch East India Company. It’s a region that you’d think would be solely defined by the strong African sun, but my visit at the hottest time of the year was marked by a strong southeasterly wind that was channelled through the vineyards by the mountain range that frames the city. Nicknamedthe Cape Doctor, it cools and provides freshness, and also blows away pests and diseases.Despite these excellent conditions for ripening grapes while retaining freshness, the area (and South Africa as a whole) got into its wine stride only in the past few decades. Problems with overproduction in the early 20th century were exacerbated by the subsequent boycotts and sanctions of the 1960s, in protest against the apartheid regime. When those were lifted in the 1990s, there was a larger focus on smaller production, higher quality, and both ecological and social sustainability (it is now common for larger wineries to support one or more social initiatives in the surrounding areas).While pinotage is still made in South Africa (it dips in and out of fashion), most of the nation’s production these days focuses on French grape varieties. Cabernet sauvignon is the most widely planted red wine grape, chenin blanc the white, and they range from the dry and simple or complex and layered, to succulent and sweet. There is alsométhode cap classique(MCC),a local sparkling wine made in the champagne method, but significantly cheaper. Graham Beck makes the best-known MCC in the UK market, and for good reason, not least because it’s staunchly reliable.The country’s wine industry is only just getting back on its feet after South Africa’s incredibly challenging Covid restrictions that saw it ban all alcohol sales and exports, so the easiest thing we can do to support them is to buy their wine.Four Cape wines to tryA Fistful of Schist Chenin Blanc 2024£7.95 The Wine Society, 12.5%.

Prop styling: Anna Wilkins.The sweet spotDessertRavneet Gill’s recipe for tapioca pudding with roast rhubarbA novel twist on rhubarb and custardRavneet GillFri 14 Feb 2025 10.00 ESTShareI’ve converted many people to tapioca with this recipe, so if you are a sceptic, I urge you to close your eyes and give it a try. This pudding is nothing like the frogspawn texture you might remember or the sticky, unpleasant mouthful you might expect. Rather, it’s a delicate, beautiful dessert with pearls swimming in silky custard, perfectly contrasted with sharp, sweet and tangy roast rhubarb.Tapioca pudding with roast rhubarbThis will keep in the fridge for up to three days, though the tapioca may need some additional milk or custard to loosen when you reheat it.Prep10 minMacerate20 minCook45 minServes4100g small pearl tapiocaFor the custard200ml whole milk200ml double cream1 vanilla pod, split lengthways50g caster sugar3 egg yolksFor the roast rhubarb200g rhubarb, trimmed and cut into chunks30g caster sugarToss the rhubarb and sugar in a large bowl, then leave to macerate for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Spread the rhubarb mixture on a baking tray, roast for 12–15 minutes, or until slightly tender, then remove and leave to cool.While the rhubarb is roasting, put the tapioca in a sieve and rinse under cold running water until it runs clear. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil, then add the tapioca and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10–15 minutes, until the pearls are mostly translucent. Drain through a fine-mesh sieve, then rinse under cold water to stop the tapioca cooking further.In another saucepan, heat the milk, cream, vanilla pod and half the sugar over a medium heat, stirring to prevent the milk from catching. In a heatproof bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the remaining sugar. When the milk mixture is steaming and just below boiling, slowly pour two-thirds of it into the egg yolk bowl, whisking continuously. Tip the yolk mixture into the saucepan with the remaining milk and cook, stirring, over a low heat for five to seven minutes, until the custard thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon; don’t let it come to a boil. Take off the heat, then strain through a fine sieve to remove the vanilla pod and any lumps.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Stir the custard into the cooked tapioca, then spoon into four bowls.
