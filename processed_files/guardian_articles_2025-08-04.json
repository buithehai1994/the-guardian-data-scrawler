Of course he did.“She’s a registered Republican? Ooh, now I love her ad. Is that right? IsSydney Sweeney… You’d be surprised at how many people are Republicans. That’s what I wouldn’t have known. But I’m glad you told me that. If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”Sweeney, for the uninitiated, and there can’t be many, first gained prominence for her roles in HBO’s Euphoria and The White Lotus and more recently co-starred in thethriller Echo Valleywith Julianne Moore.It has, however, been the 27-year-old’s “more is best” approach to commercial tie-ups and a tendency for the social media algorithms to promote her that has made the actor inescapable.She is everywhere, smiling with a dab of rejuvenating cream on her face, straining to inject cool into clog-shaped black loafers or taking selfies with a dog to promote Samsung flip phones.She can even be found in your bath tub thanks to a collaboration with a men’s personal care company to create a soap called Sydney’s Bathwater Bliss that contains a small amount of the actual water in which she has washed.Her latest advertising campaign has led her into more dangerous waters. “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality, and even eye colour,” she purrs inan advert for American Eagle denims. “My genes are blue,” she says as the camera lingers on her eyes. The strap line: Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.View image in fullscreenSweeney’s American Eagle ad campaign has become embroiled in controversy.Photograph: David ’Dee’ Delgado/ReutersThe whiff of controversy was inevitably picked up with claims that the ad was elevating the white, blond and blue eyed.One TikTok reactionvideothat received hundreds of thousands of likes commented “it’s literally giving … Nazi propaganda”. JD Vance, never one to miss such a moment, criticised the unhinged Dems and hailed an “all-American beautiful woman”. “So much of the Democrats is oriented around hostility to basic American life,” he added.Then, amid the extra scrutiny of the woman behind the storm, it emerged that Sweeney had registered as a Republican voter in Florida a few months before Trump won his second US presidency.As Trump’s delight illustrated, the benefit to the president is clear, said David Cracknell, a former political editor of Rupert Murdoch’s Sunday Times who now runs his own PR company.There is a long history of politicians chasing the celebrity endorsement, with JFK among the earliest to spot the benefits of having Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr on his side.Last summer, Harvard University’s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation published research that suggested celebrity voices could be “incredibly powerful” in promoting civic engagement and altering polling numbers. Online voter registration and poll worker volunteer rates were found to increase when a celebrity promoted them.Celebrity endorsements from the likes of Taylor Swift and Oprah Winfrey did not help Kamala Harris’s cause at the last election but the tacit endorsement of a young woman could be particularly helpful at a time when Trump is under pressure over his pastrelationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. However, Cracknell said the upside for the celebrity was far less clear.“It usually does end in tears when any celebrity gets involved in politics, just look at Kanye West and how his endorsement for Trump was mixed up with his reputational downfall,” said Cracknell. “Then he said later that he felt used by Trump. More fool you for getting involved because the politicians are much better at manipulating the media, they are doing it on a second by second basis, Trump literally.”Mark Borkowski, whose PR clients have included Michael Jackson, Joan Rivers and Van Morrison, said avoiding political entanglements, particularly in the infancy of a career when hopefuls rely on goodwill from all sides, was vital.From Sydney Sweeney to Dunkin’, why brands think being hot and white is ‘great genes’ | Arwa MahdawiRead moreWhenTaylor Swift praised two Democratic candidatesin her home state of Tennessee back in 2018 it led to a fearsome backlash but she stuck to her guns, going on to back Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for president.It can hardly be said that her career has suffered but Swift was established, said Borkowski, as were other celebrities, such as John Wayne and Charlton Heston who threw themselves into political causes, the former with the Republican party and the latter the civil rights movement and then the National Rifle Association.“I am fascinated by Sydney Sweeney,” Borkowski said. “She’s become the sort of delicious siren of the gen Z media. She has got all the echoes of Jayne Mansfield or Marilyn Monroe, but she’s totally overpromoted.“She’s clickbait and it’s the worst idea to declare a political affiliation, especially in the inferno that is American discourse. It’s a massive PR risk because she hasn’t made it yet. She is not Margot Robbie, she does not have Oscars behind her.”As if to illustrate the danger for celebrities who dip a toe in American politics, Trump later doubled down on his Truth Social platform to praise Sweeney’s instincts and castigate Swift.He said: “Ever since I alerted the world as to what she was by saying on TRUTH that I can’t stand her (HATE!) She was booed out of the Super Bowl and became NO LONGER HOT.“The tide has seriously turned – Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Sweeney is yet to comment on her political sympathies butplenty of others, beyond Trump, will have a say, said Borkowski. “Silence in politics is really important now because if you don’t, you’re going to be exposed by the full weight of the opposition on social media,” he said. “It’ll be carnage. She’s a bombshell, but she’s not box office yet.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTaylor SwiftKamala HarrisJoe BidenSydney SweeneynewsShareReuse this content"

I tried one for two weeksCelebrities have been sporting them on walks and influencers are peddling them on TikTok – what are they and what are the benefits?Tell us: share your experiences of traveling with friendsMadeleine AggelerMon 4 Aug 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.01 EDTShareAfew months ago, something changed. One minute, people were trudging along as usual; the next it seemed like every third person I passed on the street was wearing a weird, heavy little backpack. Initially, I mistook several of these bulky, menacing items for bulletproof vests. (Scary.) Eventually, I realized they were simply the latest fitness trend: weighted vests.Celebrities have beensporting them on walks, Peloton instructors are making videosexplaininghow to use them, and influencers are peddling them onTikTok.Publicationshave written about their growing popularity among “the menopause set”, asAllureput it, because of their supposed ability to help with muscle strength and bone density as one ages.“It really has gotten so much attention lately,” says Dr Elaina Manolis, a physical therapist and clinical professor at Northeastern University. The practice used to be called “rucking”, she notes, because people would walk with heavy rucksacks.One reason for this spike is that the vests don’t look so much like bulky backpacks anymore, Manolis suspects: “They’re sleek and cute,” she says. She also believes it’s part of a bigger societal trend. “Culture has shifted so much for the positive in women’s health, and in understanding the importance of strength training and bone density,” she says.So are weighted vests the miracle workout upgrade some claim? I tried one for two weeks, and asked experts for advice.What is a weighted vest?They are vests that are weighed down with iron sand or small weights. “They can be thought of as ‘hyper-gravity’,” says Dr Abbi Lane, assistant professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan. “They add a little bit more weight and resistance.”Typically, they weigh anywhere from five to 30lbs (2.26 to 13.6kg), and are worn across the shoulders and upper torso. Some are small, with straps across the chest. Others are bigger, cover most of the torso and look disconcertingly like bulletproof vests.View image in fullscreenInitially, I mistook several of these bulky, menacing items for bulletproof vests.Photograph: Madeleine Aggeler/The Guardian“Start with a vest that’s no more than five to 10% of your body weight, and build from there,” says Dr Mary Claire Haver, obstetrician-gynecologist and medical advisory board member ofLet’s Talk Menopause.I ordered a 16lb (7.25 kg) vest by a brand called Prodigen that seemed relatively comfortable and wouldn’t make me look like I was on my way to a gun range.How do you use a weighted vest?Weighted vests are different to other equipment in that they can be worn pretty much anywhere and at any time.“Whereas you might do resistance training in a gym for 30 minutes twice a week, you could put on the weighted vest during other activities,” says Lane.It’s still best to limit one’s use though, especially in the beginning.“I don’t recommend it for everyday use,” says Manolis. Most daily tasks involve a lot of bending and stretching, and adding weight raises the risk of injury.Manolis recommends wearing a vest when walking – which she calls “a very underrated exercise as it is” – because you are in an upright posture and the potential for injury is much lower.If you are confident in the vest, you can also use it for “light aerobics, strength training and even short bouts of running”, says Haver. Make sure your joints can tolerate the load though. Start by wearing the vest for a short period of time, then build up. “Aim for 20-30 minutes a day, and listen to your body,” says Haver.What does a weighted vest feel like?Twice a week, for two weeks, I wore my vest for my current favorite physical activity: walking on the treadmill in the air conditioned gym whilewatching Veraon my iPad. When I first strapped it on, the vest felt heavy but oddly comforting – like a thunder shirt for dogs.As I started walking, I was surprised by how off-balance I felt. It took me a few minutes to find my stride, and holding myself upright and centered required more core strength than I had expected. By the time my 30 minutes was up, DCI Vera Stanhope had realized that all was not as it seemed in her murder case, and I was breathing noticeably harder than usual.Why did it feel more challenging? I have previously weighed 16lbs more than I do now, and I don’t recall feeling more tired when I walked.When you wear a vest, “the weight is not distributed throughout the body,” explains Lane. “When I was 16lbs heavier, my legs and arms were bigger too. When you have the vest, it’s all in one place and you have to adjust your center of mass,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis challenges your balance, but it’s important that the vest not be so heavy that it requires you to significantly change your gait. “That’s how injuries can happen,” she says.Over time, I felt less off-kilter when I wore the vest. My walks felt more intense than usual, but not unpleasant.What are the benefits of wearing a weighted vest?Weighing down your body with a weighted vest has a number of benefits, says Manolis. When your body is heavier, moving requires more muscle, she explains. And over time, as more muscle develops, strength improves. The greater weight will also require more energy to move, and thus your body will burn more calories.Someresearchshows that long-term use of weighted vests can prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women, a population particularly at risk for low bone density and resulting conditions like osteopenia and osteoporosis. Manolis suggests that this may be because the added top-down pressure that a vest places on one’s skeletal system can improve how quickly bones repair themselves.Most studies on weighted vests and bone density have been small though, warns Lane – fewer than 20 people. Thebiggest studyon the topic had 150 participants. The one-year, randomized control trial explored whether exercising with a weighted vest could offset bone loss in older adults who were trying to lose weight. It did not.“The research here is not super fleshed out yet,” Lane says.The flexibility and affordability of weighted vests mean they can still be a useful piece of equipment. “We’re finally talking about muscle and bone loss in midlife women,” says Haver. “And weighted vests are a simple, affordable way to help combat that.”Ideally though, they would be used in conjunction with other forms of cardio and strength training. “I think of things like weighted vests as the cherry on top,” says Lane. “Potentially beneficial, but nothing replaces aerobic and resistance exercise.”What are the risks of wearing a weighted vest?The greatest risks come from wearing a vest that is too heavy, or wearing one for too long.“It can cause joint strain, poor posture, or even back or knee pain,” says Haver. Proper fit and gradual progression are key, she says. And if you ever feel discomfort, stop. “Don’t push through pain,” she warns.VerdictI’ve worn my weighted vest a few more times since my two-week trial. I don’t love how sweaty it makes me. I’m also not sure about the best way to clean it as the manufacturer didn’t provide any instructions. (I’ve been using cleaning wipes – please don’t tell me if this is wrong.) But it is a nice way to add some difficulty and novelty to my Vera walks.Still, I don’t think it’s going to become a staple in my routine. I strength train several times a week, and a set of heavy squats feels like a more effective, challenging and satisfying way of strengthening my legs andbonesthan walking with 16lbs of extra weight.I did enjoy that it made me look like an action movie hero though. When I asked my partner how I looked in it, he responded: “Tactical.” That’s way cooler than my usual gym look: sweaty 30-something woman in a Rainforest Cafe T-shirt.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyFitnessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the 35-year-old factory worker from Cwmbran in southWalesalso had little idea that a loan he took out in 2017 to buy a second-hand Suzuki Swift would place him at the heart of a David v Goliath battle.His case would go on to expose egregious commission practices in the car finance market andlead to a compensation schemethat could cost some of the UK’s largest banks and specialist lenders up to £18bn.“I thought it would be like when you did those PPI claim forms: you were just going to get a few pounds in the bank in a month or two. That’s what I expected this to be,” Johnson said. “I had no idea it would turn into what it has today. I had no idea the impact it would have.”What started as interest in a Facebook advert about potential misselling of car loans led to a three-and-a-half year legal battle escalating to the UK supreme court. On Friday, Johnson’s case was the sole one of three consumer complaints left standing, with supreme court judges concerned abouthis “unfair” treatmentby car lenders.That was due in part to the size of the commission that the lender paid to the car dealer – a quarter of the Suzuki’s near-£6,500 price tag – as well as a failure to disclose that a single lender, in this case South Africa’s FirstRand, was given first dibs on the contract, rather than it being taken to a panel of lenders to secure the best deal.Johnson admitted that he did not read all the documents that the Cardiff dealership gave him about the blue hatchback. But the supreme court questioned whether it was reasonable to expect “commercially unsophisticated” borrowers to read and understand the terms of the commission buried in reams of fine print.“It was a very rushed process where they gave me a big box full of paperwork and expected me then to comb through hundreds of pages,” Johnson recalls. “I felt like they were telling me what I needed to know. I had no idea that they were leaving things out.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Wrench, from Trentham, Staffordshire, lost his claim in Friday’s ruling.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianOnce lawyers explained the terms of his loan, Johnson was floored. “As all the evidence and all the information was presented, I almost found it unbelievable.”His case, which has dragged through Britain’s legal system since November 2022, exposed the complex and symbiotic relationship between lenders, manufacturers and car dealers in the UK’s multi-billion pound motor finance industry. Between 80% and 90% of new cars in the UK are now bought using borrowed money, with dealers paying commission to lenders. Had the two other cases bundled with Johnson’s claim been upheld, the industry could have faced a massive compensation bill fit to rival the £50bn PPI scandal.Johnson, speaking during a trip to Butlin’s in Minehead with his six-year-old daughter, said the entire saga had been stressful at times and pushed him out of his comfort zone.He even gets recognised on the street, thanks to doing TV interviews. “I’m not shy, but I kind of keep myself to myself, so it’s just a bit strange for me.”However, he feels it is a small price to pay to hold lenders to account. He said one car finance company contacted him in recent months to ask how it could be more transparent with buyers.Johnson is hoping those changes last, and that theregulator’s new compensation schemewill give money back to consumers who were unknowingly overcharged. “Hopefully it opens up a way for people in my position to be able to get what they should back. I would definitely do it all again.”Even Andrew Wrench, 61, who lost his case in the same court ruling on Friday, said it was worth the battle. Judges rejected Wrench’s case, alongside another filed by Amy Hopcraft, a nurse, which argued that commissions paid to car dealers amounted to bribes, and that dealers should be acting in customers’ best financial interests.View image in fullscreenMarcus Johnson said one finance company. contacted recently to ask how it could be more transparent with buyers.Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/The GuardianWhile it proved a disappointing end to his 26-month court battle, Wrench said family and friends were proud of his work. “My nephew Billy said ‘Look, you’ve highlighted it. You’ve done the right thing. A lot of people respect you for that, and be proud of what you’ve achieved, because there are going to be some compensatory packages for consumers.’”Car loan scandal: what the supreme court ruling means for UK motoristsRead moreWhile Wrench will not get a payout on that single claim, he acknowledged that there could have been sweeping repercussions had his case been upheld. Car lenders have warned that a big compensation bill could push some firms into failure, while others would offer fewer, or more expensive loans, to claw back their losses. That could restrict options for people who relied on credit.Spooked by the warning, Rachel Reeves subsequently launched a failed attempt to intervene in the supreme court ruling, and warned judges to avoid handing a “windfall” to consumers. The chancellor later consideredoverruling the supreme court with retrospective legislation, in order to limit a potential £44bn bill.“I didn’t want anybody to lose jobs. I don’t want the economy to be affected. And the Treasury is already in a mess anyway,” Wrench said. “I wasn’t in it for that, and I wasn’t in it for compensation at all. I was in, from the get-go, [to expose lenders] that were deceitful, dishonest and otherwise.”But Wrench’s work is not over. He has one more car finance claim to pursue, and has two other unrelated cases – on mortgage terms and diesel emissions claims – making their way through the courts.In the meantime, he is keeping inspirational figures, such as the underdog lawyer and environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich, in mind. “She risked everything to take on the big boys.”Explore more on these topicsMotor financeWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We spoke to four families about why they enjoy watching bands together.‘It felt like a multi-generational event’Mark Taubert, his seven-year-old son and his 12-year-old daughter were one of many families in attendance at Stevie Wonder’s Cardiff concert in Blackweir Fields, Cardiff, in July. “He came on to the stage and lit the place up with his charisma and magnetism. I was surprised to see quite a few different age groups in the crowd. ThenStevie Wonderbrought two of his own children on stage, and it felt even more like a multigenerational event,” he says.“My son Idris even had a brief restorative snooze during Living for the City, but then woke up for Sir Duke – one of his favourites.”Even if Idris didn’t fully appreciate the whole show, Mark hopes his son will in future. “In 80 years’ time, Stevie Wonder will just be this sort of legendary figure of the past, and my son will be able to say that he saw him.”It was quite the contrast to the gigs of his youth, Mark says. “My worst was Guns N’ Roses in Mannheim when I was 16. There was a riot at that show. It wasn’t necessarily something I’d take my kids to.”‘We combined Jesus and Mary Chain with a trip to the skatepark’View image in fullscreenJames Cooper and his daughter Astrid.Photograph: Guardian CommunityBefore the Oasis reunion tourcommenced in July, The Jesus and Mary Chain played Tramshed in Cardiff in June. The gig was a bonding experience for James Cooper and his daughter Astrid.“As a fan of theJesus and Mary Chainsince I was 15, I was delighted that my daughter Astrid declared that they were her favourite band too,” he says. “I recalled to Astrid that JAMC were the precursors to Oasis – being warring brothers on the same label and paving the way for Oasis in many ways – but loads better! We are both skateboarders, so we combined the day with a trip to the skatepark. I considered ourselves very lucky that we got to see the far superior band in a small venue.“My daughter loved the day and the experience. She didn’t get emotional like I did, though. It was maybe more significant for me, as she is almost same age as I was when I first saw them at 15.

In a previous social media tirade last week, he said of Russia and India: “They can take their dead economies down together.”India to still buy oil from Russia despite Trump threats, say officialsRead moreAppearing on Fox News on Sunday at the weekend, his hardline deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, did not hold back as he took direct aim at India, stating that Trump had made it clear “it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this [Ukraine] war by purchasing the oil from Russia”.The whiplash the last few days have caused in the corridors of New Delhi is palpable. It was only February when India’s prime minister,Narendra Modi, was one of the first world leaders to be hosted by Trump and the two men embraced each other and hailed their “great friendship”. Indian officials were adamant that Russia had not even come up in trade negotiations until Trump’s public outburst.India had come to view the US as one of its strongest and most reliable partners, united by the bonhomie between its leaders and growing cooperation on everything from regional security and defence to bilateral trade, intelligence, technology and an increasingly powerful Indian diaspora in the US.A united geopolitical ambition to counterbalance the power of China had only brought them further together under recent presidents.Yet it did not go unnoticed by India that China – the other big buyer of sanctioned Russian oil, which also has leverage over the US in the form of rare earths – has not received similar threats, and neither has Turkey.Trump’s moves have been met with a frosty, if not outright defiant, reception among Indian officials. After Trump told reporters he had heard India would “no longer” be buying Russian oil,he was swiftly contradicted by Indian officials over the weekend, who said there would be no change in policy.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi and Vladimir Putin at a Brics summit in 2024. ‘India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership,’ India’s foreign ministry spokesperson said.Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/ReutersUnder India’s “non-alignment” foreign policy it has maintained a close partnership with Russia over decades while strengthening ties with the US; a position largely tolerated by Washington and reiterated by Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, following Trump’s threats.“Our bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country,” said Jaiswal. “India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership.”In a column in the Indian Express, Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, did not mince his words. “Donald Trump was supposed to be good for India in his second presidency,” he said. “He has turned out to be a nightmare.”Saran was among those who called for India to follow the example of China and Brazil and stand up to Trump. He insisted that although there would be “pain in resisting Trump … we should be prepared to endure it”.“Submitting to his exaggerated demands, which are now political as well as economic, would severely undermine India’s national interests,” said Saran. “We cannot give any country a veto over which countries India should or should not partner with.”It is widely agreed among analysts that Modi has been put in an unenviable position by Trump; either acquiesce to Trump’s demands and see loss of face domestically or reject them and face sky-high tariffs – and possibly other punitive actions – that would cripple the Indian economy.The Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta said India was not the exception in mistakenly thinking that “Trump is purely transactional and that by placating him, pandering to his ego and giving him good headlines, it will be enough to make him quietly dial back”.One of the major sticking points for Modi, he said, was the highly public nature of Trump’s threats, which had complicated the possibility of backdoor negotiations over India quietly moving away from buying Russian oil and arms.He said Trump had already “frankly humiliated the Indian prime minister” over the recent India-Pakistan conflict in May, where Trump had publicly taken the credit for negotiating a ceasefire – a position vehemently denied by the Modi government in the aftermath.Trump’srecent embrace of Pakistan, signing deals with India’s enemy on cryptocurrency, mining and oil – and even having the chagrin to suggest India may one day buy Pakistani oil – as well as hosting the Pakistan army chief for lunch in the White House, had only added insult to injury.Mehta said suspicions towards the US in New Delhi now resembled those of 1971, when President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, sent warships to India in what is considered one of the lowest points of the US-India relationship. “The damage is already done,” said Mehta. “No matter what deal they come to now, distrust of the US is only going to continue to skyrocket.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaDonald TrumpNarendra ModiUS foreign policyRussiaUkraineOilanalysisShareReuse this content"

I knew I had to stop throwing food away. I immediately became much more creative with the meals I was making …Chiara WilkinsonMon 4 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 05.09 EDTShareFrom calendar-keeping to cooking, for years, my hyper-organised personality crept into every corner of my life. I would save Instagram recipe videos and cuttings from weekend newspapers and use them to plan shopping lists with grand ideas about midweek dinners: a white bean stew pencilled in for one night, tacos another, homemade burgers another. I was always overambitious.You would think this level of planning would translate into less food waste. But a busy routine working in London, often with last-minute events and long commutes, meant I was too tired to make anything when I came home. By Wednesday, I would fill up with shop-bought sushi or soup. More often than not, I would get to the end of the week with a fridge full of wilted ingredients, which I would quietly chuck into the food waste. I felt guilt and shame, but I was stuck in a loop.View image in fullscreenWilkinson: ‘It took the idea of growing my own food to truly understand its value.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianIt took an audit of my spending last summer to get myself in check. During that time, I also decided to grow tomatoes in the garden of my shared flat. I was a novice gardener, but soon I became obsessed with caring for these plants. It was as if a switch had been flicked in my mind – as if it had taken the idea of growing my own food to truly understand the value and timescale of food production. I made a commitment to myself then and there to change my habits.Now, I save every last scrap of uneaten food and integrate it into my next meal: using cubes of stale bread to bulk up soups, or cracking an egg or two into a three-day-old chilli for a breakfast shakshuka. I have a container of vegetable skins in the freezer, which I’m planning to boil for stock. Quick-pickled carrots or cucumbers, with a splash of soy, are a go-to for brightening boring carbs.The scandal of food waste – and how we can stop itRead moreWhen I can, I’ll pick upToo Good to Goboxes, which contain surplus food from local cafes, restaurants and bakeries for reduced prices, and challenge myself to make something quick and tasty from the random assortment. It’s usually a soup, or “stovies” – a Scottish dish made with boiled potatoes and whatever meat is available.I also broke the closed-minded rules I had cemented in my head about food. Fruit can go with savoury dishes, for instance – apples work well in curries, while berries add colour to a salad. I used to shy away from beige on beige, but leftover roast potatoes with garlic and spaghetti is a new favourite. A lot of this is probably obvious to most people – but for me, it has been something of a breakthrough, although not without a few flavour disasters. I’ve learned that Sichuan pepper and mint should be used sparingly, and that it is possible to addtoomuch chocolate to a chilli. My way to make anything edible is to cover it in sriracha.I’m less ambitious with midweek meals now, but I’m much more creative. I have saved money and time, and will no longer wince when I open the fridge at the end of the week. It’s been freeing, in a way – and has helped me embrace spontaneity in other parts of my life, such as social plans. Best of all, I’ve rediscovered what I loved about cooking in the first place: the joy of making something delicious out of almost nothing.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedFoodHealth & wellbeingFood wastefeaturesShareReuse this content"

More than 200 people have already been arrested in response to the proscription last month.A Met police spokesperson said the organisers of Saturday’s planned protest are attempting to put the overcrowded criminal justice system under further pressure.“We are aware that the organisers of Saturday’s planned protest are encouraging hundreds of people to turn out with the intention of placing a strain on the police and the wider criminal justice system,” they said.“The Met is very experienced in dealing with large-scale protests, including where the protest activity crosses into criminality requiring arrests. Our officers will continue to apply the law in relation to Palestine Action as we have done since its proscription. Anyone showing support for the group can expect to be arrested.”Starmer’s official spokesperson urged people not to attend. “Any action that is in support of a proscribed group in the UK, of course we do not support and the court has confirmed their continued proscription status,” they said.“The home secretary previously said that those who seek to support this group may yet not know the true nature of this organisation, but people should be under no illusion this is not a peaceful or non-violent protest group.”Sadiq Khan, who was vocal in urging Starmer to recognise a Palestinian state, declined to weigh in. A spokesperson for the mayor of London said: “The policing of Saturday’s planned protest by Defend Our Juries is an operational decision for the Metropolitan police.”On Tuesday, a delegation organised by Jewish Voice for Labour will deliver a letter signed by 300 Jewish figures to No 10 and Cooper urging a lifting of the ban on the group.Also signed by the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman KC and the playwright Gillian Slovo, it will express “horror” at the actions of Israel.The letter will say: “We consider the proscription of Palestine Action to be illegitimate and unethical. It is time to end the government’s hand-wringing over the level of slaughter and suffering in Gaza and the West Bank, mixed with tacit support to the Israeli state.The Met is sceptical of claims that thousands of people could turn up on Saturday. The force believes that a total in the low hundreds is more likely. Anyone arrested risks a terrorism conviction.At other events that led to mass arrests, the Met has arrested people, confirmed their identities and home addresses, and then quickly released them on bail so they could be dealt with later.Police resources will be stretched at the weekend as a large, separate pro-Palestinian march is also scheduled for Saturday and anti-immigration protests are expected.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries denied any plot to overwhelm the police and the court system, as reported in the Telegraph on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are not the ones planning to ‘overwhelm’ the system,” they said. “If the Met exercises common sense and discretion and upholds its obligation to uphold the right of people to exercise their rights then nothing is being overwhelmed.“It is a difficult position for Sir Mark Rowley [the Metropolitan police commissioner] to be in. Based on what has happened on previous occasions it would be surprising if no one is arrested but on the other [hand] everyone is going to be doing the same thing and it will be a challenge to arrest more than 500 people given that we think there are about 520 available police cells in London at any one time.”They believed Rowley would be factoring in last week’s high court ruling giving permission to the co-founder of Palestine Action to bring a legal challenge to the home secretary’s decision to ban the group.Other forces exercised discretion not to arrest people at similar protests in Derry, Edinburgh and elsewhere, they added.The protests would take place regularly in future, they said, adding that it was becoming “a badge of honour” to be arrested.Defend Our Juries has held discussions with MPs about taking part but there was a reluctance on the basis of concerns it could lead to suspension from parliament.About 40 pro-Palestine protesters gathered outside the Labour party headquarters on Monday evening.Campaigners held Palestine flags and chanted “Shame on Keir Starmer, shame on the Labour party, shame on David Lammy” while banging steel pot lids outside the office in Southwark, London.One sign displayed by the group read “We support the legal application to de-proscribe Palestine Action. Fight racism. Fight imperialism.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The criminal justice system will always be ready to deal with sudden surges coming through the courts.”The Home Office did not respond to questions about the planned protest.Explore more on these topicsProtestMichael RosenMike LeighMetropolitan policeLondonIsrael-Gaza warPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Police are understood to be treating him as a victim, not a suspect, at this stage. Police have said he was admitted to hospital “with serious injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening”.CCTV from the busy central London station has been recovered and studied by detectives. Robinson had been leafleting at the station earlier, and on the video can be heard saying “he come at me”.Robinson is a former leader of the extreme-right English Defence League. The far-right monitoring group Hope Not Hate describes him as the “best-known far-right extremist in Britain”.Police believe he left Britain shortly after a video was put online showing him near the injured man.The video does not show how the injured man came to be lying motionless on the floor.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

About 50 people a week are expected to be returned during the pilot of the so-called “one in, one out” scheme.The Home Office said the pilot was “operationally ready” and that detentions could start within days. The summer months, when the weather tends to be better, are usually the high point for crossings, with 898 arrivals on 30 July alone.Napier barracks to continue housing asylum seekers after small boat influxRead moreSince the start of the year, about 25,000 people have sought asylum by arriving on small boats across the Channel. The Conservatives have panned the scheme, saying the numbers arriving would mean it was the equivalent of “17 in, one out”.Nationalities at the greatest risk will be prioritised on the newly opened safe route and will be subject to full documentation and security and eligibility checks.The pilot scheme runs until June 2026, after which both the UK andFrancehave said they will assess its future.The final text of the deal was signed by the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, and her French counterpart, Bruno Retailleau, last week, and approved by the European Commission, which was thought to be a potential obstacle.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the agreement was “the product of months of grownup diplomacy delivering real results for British people as we broker deals no government has been able to achieve and strike at the heart of these vile gangs’ business model.“The days of gimmicks and broken promises are over – we will restore order to our borders with the seriousness and competence the British people deserve.”Cooper said the government would robustly defend any legal challenge, saying it had learned from thefailed Rwanda deportation schemeunder the Conservatives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The strongest gust away from mountains was 80mph at South Uist.Storm Floris was the UK’s sixth named storm of the 2024-25 season and the first since Storm Éowyn in January.View image in fullscreenPeople run for cover during Storm Floris in Portstewart on the north coast of Northern Ireland.Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/ReutersIts arrival led to an amber weather warning across much of Scotland, with police advising against unnecessary travel. The alert, which warns of there being a danger to life, is in place until 11pm on Monday.A yellow weather warning was in place across southern Scotland,Northern Ireland, parts of north Wales and northern England. It warned of “unseasonably strong and potentially disruptive winds” until midnight.Rail travel was severely disrupted, with LNER telling passengers not to travel north of Newcastle. Avanti West Coast advised people not to travel north of Preston.ScotRail said there would be a blanket 50mph speed restriction and many services stopped at midday.Posting on social media, the rail operatorasked people who lived near railway lines to tie down garden furniture and trampolines because of the danger of them blowing on to tracks.Disruption to the rail network in Scotland will probably continue into Tuesday, passengers have been warned. Network Rail said it was working tirelessly to clear routes blocked by falling trees and debris but some checks will need to be carried out on Tuesday morning.Weather warnings for Monday and TuesdayThe Forth Bridge wasclosed to doubledecker buses, motorcyclists and pedestriansand many other bridges were closed to high-sided vehicles. In Newcastle, the Tyne Bridge was closed to all traffic because of the wind.A number of campervans were blown over on the A87 road, which leads to Portree on the Isle of Skye.The aviation analytics company Cirium said 68 flights from UK airports on Monday were cancelled including 12 at Aberdeen, the worst-affected airport.Monday’s performance of the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo was cancelled, the first time in its 75-year history that it had not gone ahead because of the weather.A swathe of Edinburgh festival fringe events were also cancelled, with the Pleasance Courtyard and the Pleasance Plazaboth closed until 6pm.Edinburgh zooclosed at lunchtimebecause of the escalating wind speed.School pupils in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles were warned that the delivery of some exam results, expected on Tuesday, would be delayed.0:23Cow chaos after Storm Floris blows down fences setting bovines loose in North Lanarkshire – videoFloris is the strongest named storm to have occurred in the month of August. Since the naming process was started in 2015, there have been five named storms in August. The Met Office forecaster Peter Sloss told BBC Radio Scotland it represented “uncharted territory”.Dr Jess Neumann, an associate professor of hydrology at the University of Reading, said summer storms came with added dangers.She said: “There is a potential danger to life as Storm Floris is due to hit during peak summer holiday time when people may be travelling or visiting unfamiliar places outside of their usual area. When the unexpected hits, that’s when people are the least prepared and most at risk.”‘Climateflation’ could push up UK food prices by more than a third by 2050, report saysRead moreLorna Slater, the Scottish Green co-leader, said the storm showed the need for urgent action to tackle the climate crisis.Slater said: “We should not be seeing storms like this in August, but with climate chaos around us these kinds of scenes will only become more common and more severe.”There were reports of fallen trees on roads and rail lines across the affected area as well as power cuts in Northern Ireland, Scotland and northernEngland.Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it was working to restore power to 22,500 properties in the Highlands and north-east Scotland, with more cuts expected later in the day.Not everyone would be reconnected by the end of the day, the company said.SSEN’s director of customer operations, Andy Smith, said Floris was the strongest summer storm it had seen in a very long time. “At the height of summer, we’ve mounted an operation that’s comparable in size to the ones we mobilise when a storm hits during the depths of winter,” he said.The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Matthew Lehnert, said: “Winds will first ease in the west during later Monday but remaining very strong overnight until early Tuesday in the east. Heavy rain may also contribute to the disruption in places.”Explore more on these topicsUK weatherRail transportTransportScotlandEnglandNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s genocide’Nina LakhaniMon 4 Aug 2025 10.48 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 15.59 EDTShareThe UN expert who first warned thatIsraelwas orchestrating a campaign of deliberate mass starvation in Gaza more than 500 days ago, has said that governments and corporations cannot claim to be surprised at the horror now unfolding.“Israel has built the most efficient starvation machine you can imagine. So while it’s always shocking to see people being starved, no one should act surprised. All the information has been out in the open since early 2024,” Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, told the Guardian.“Israel is starving Gaza. It’s genocide. It’s a crime against humanity. It’s a war crime. I have been repeating it and repeating it and repeating it, I feel like Cassandra,” said Fakhri, referring to the Greek mythological figure whose warnings and predictions were ignored.On 9 October 2023 – two days after the deadly Hamas attack – Israel’s then defense minister, Yoav Gallant, declared a “complete siege” of Gaza and said he would halt the supply of electricity, food, water and fuel. By December 2023, Gazans accounted for 80% of the people in the world experiencing catastrophic hunger,according to UN andinternational aid agency figures.The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in GazaRead moreNow, widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease are driving the sharp rise in hunger-related deaths across Gaza, with more than 20,000 children hospitalized for acute malnutrition between April and mid-July, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC),a global initiative that provides real-time data on hunger and famine for the UN and aid groups.The “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out” across the Gaza Strip, the IPC warned in an alert earlier this week.Fakhri was among the first to warn about the impending famine – and the need for urgent action to stop Israel from starving 2 million people in Gaza.In an interviewwith the Guardian published on 28 February 2024,Fakhri said: “We have never seen a civilian population made to go so hungry so quickly and so completely, that is the consensus among starvation experts … ​​Intentionally depriving people of food is clearly a war crime. Israel has announced its intention to destroy the Palestinian people, in whole or in part, simply for being Palestinian … this is now a situation of genocide.”bar chart showing starvation deaths in Gaza over timeThe following month, the international court of justice recognized the risk of genocide in Gaza and drew attention to the “spread of famine and starvation”. The ICJ said that Israel must immediately take all necessary and effective measures, in cooperation with the UN, to ensure unfettered access to humanitarian aid including food, water, shelter, fuel and medicines.In May, the Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, and former defense minister Gallant became the first ever individuals to beformally accused by an international court of deliberate starvation, which is a war crime.In July 2024, a group of UN experts including Fakhri declared a famine after the first deaths from starvation were reported in Gaza. Fakhri also publisheda detailed report for the UN into Israel’sdecades-long control over food production and supplies to Palestinians, a stranglehold which meant 80% of people in Gaza were dependent on aid when Gallant announced the current siege in October 2023.Yet there has been little or no action to stop Israel starving Palestinians, which it has achieved by systematically destroying local food production (greenhouses, orchards, farmland) and blocking aid – in violation of international law.According to Fakhri, this is why famine has now taken hold in Gaza.“Famine is always political, always predictable and always preventable. But there is no verb to famine. We don’t famine people, we starve them – and that inevitably leads to famine if no political action is taken to avoid it.“But to frame the mass starvation as a consequence of the most recent blockade, is a misunderstanding of how starvation works and what’s going on in Gaza. People don’t all of a sudden starve, children don’t wither away that quickly. This is because they have been deliberately weakened for so long. The state of Israel itself has used food as a weapon since its creation. It can and does loosen and tighten its starvation machine in response to pressure; it has been fine-tuning this for 25 years.”chart showing Israel's figures for aid to Gaza, indicating food below subsistence levelsDespite stark images of skeletal Palestinians, the Israeli government and some of its allies have continued to insist that the hunger is the result of logistical problems, not a state policy. Last week Netanyahu said: “There is no policy of starvation in Gaza. There is no starvation in Gaza.”Unicef isamong multiple aid agencies to confirm that malnutrition and starvation have escalated since early March 2025 – when Israel unilaterally violated a ceasefire agreed after Donald Trump returned to the White House. Israel reinstated a total blockade after allowing some aid trucks in during the ceasefire, though UN agencies and charities on the ground said it was never enough to fully meet the needs of the starved, sick and weakened population.The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an opaque logistics group backed by Israel and the Trump administration, began operations in May, with armed security provided by private contractors and the Israeli military. It was authorized to replace 400 UN distribution hubs with just four across Gaza, in response to unproven claims that international aid was being diverted by Hamas.The UN andhundreds of aid groups condemned the move as a weaponization of aid that violated long-established humanitarian norms. On1 June, Israeli soldiers killed 32 people atGHF sites, and since then more than 1,300 starving Palestinians have been killed trying to access food. Israel has long sought to discredit and weaken the UN and other international mechanisms including the courts, which it sees as hostile to its ongoing de facto annexation of Palestinian territories, accusing them of antisemitism.“This is using aid not for humanitarian purposes, but to control populations, to move them, to humiliate and weaken people as part of their military tactics. The GHF is so frightening because it might be the new militarized dystopia of aid of the future,” Fakhri said.In a statement, GHF rejected the reports of Palestinian deaths as “false and exaggerated statistics” and accused the UN of not doing enough. “If the UN and other groups would collaborate with us, we could end the starvation, desperation and violent incidents almost overnight. We could scale up, add more distribution sites and ramp up direct-to-community delivery which GHF is piloting now,” a spokesperson said.The Israeli government did not respond to request for comment.The deaths from starvation and aid-hub massacres come on top of at least 60,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli bombs and tanks.Studies haveconcluded that the real death toll is almost certainly much higher, and Israel has continued to deny international researchers and journalists entry into Gaza.Fakhri and other UN experts have repeatedly urged member states and corporations to act to stop the bombs and famine by cutting financial and military aid and trade with Israel, as well as broad-based economic and political sanctions.“I see stronger political language, more condemnation, more plans proposed, but despite the change in rhetoric, we’re still in the phase of inaction. The politicians and corporations have no excuse, they’re really shameful. The fact that millions of people are mobilizing in growing numbers shows that everyone in the world understands how many different countries, corporations and individuals are culpable.”Fakhri argues that in light of the US persistent vetoing of ceasefire resolutions at the UN security council, it is incumbent on the UN general assembly to call for peacekeepers to accompany humanitarian convoys into Gaza.“They have the majority of votes, and most importantly, millions of people are demanding this. Ordinary people are trying to break through an illegal blockade to deliver humanitarian aid, to implement international law their governments are failing to do. Why else do we have peacekeepers if not to end genocide and prevent starvation?”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaFaminenewsShareReuse this content"

Her life is in danger,” it said. The British embassy in Athens issued a similar statement.As Monday drew to a close, Greek officials said that no decision had yet been made about whether or not to continue the search-and-rescue operation on Tuesday.“Hope dies last,” said one. “Any scenario would be guessing at this point, and it is too early to make any decision.”Even if the coastguard operation was brought to a halt, the search would continue on land, and regular patrol boats would still comb the seas as part of their daily activities.Bourda is not the first Briton to go missing in Greece this summer. Last month, another silver alert was activated after the family of 60-year-old Jay Arnold notified police that he had vanished while holidaying on the southern Aegean isle of Karpathos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police were alerted when he failed to check out of his room on the day he was due to leave. Though his rented car was found parked and locked, authorities have since described the search for him as “going cold”.“We’ve had dogs brought in, drones, specially trained police and volunteers out there looking and we’ve found nothing,” local police officer Panayiotis Fotopoulos said. “It’s very odd, a total mystery, that absolutely nothing should be found after so many weeks. We’re not ruling out that perhaps he fell into the sea.”Last June, the celebrity doctor and TV presenterMichael Mosley was found deadfive days after he went missing on the remote Greek island of Symi. An inquest determined he had likely died as a result of accidental heatstroke after getting lost as he attempted to return from the beach to his lodgings.With its crystal clear blue waters and golden sands, Ofrynio beach is among the most picturesque places in northern Greece, which, like the rest of the country, has been hit by record temperatures in recent weeks.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

They are just two people who are travelling around the world.”He also renewed his criticism on Monday of the UK government, saying it felt as if ministers and officials were just going “through the motions” in their response.A Foreign Office spokesperson said it was “deeply concerned” at Iran’s espionage allegations and that it continues to raise the case “directly with the Iranian authorities”.“We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members,” she added.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Let Bolsonaro speak!”In his ruling, Moraes noted that despite being banned from using social media, the far-right leader took part by phone in a pro-Bolsonaro demonstration on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday. During the rally, one of his politician sons, senator Flávio Bolsonaro, held a phone to the microphone so the crowd could hear the former president speak.View image in fullscreenA frame grab from AFPTV shows Brazil’s senator Flavio Bolsonaro (R) broadcasting a phone call with his father, Jair Bolsonaro, during a demonstration at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro.Photograph: Bruno Kaiuca/AFPTV/AFP/Getty ImagesThe senator himself had posted a video on social media showing Bolsonaro addressing supporters by phone – but later deleted the footage. Moraes argued that the deletion was a “blatant” attempt to conceal the breach of court-ordered restrictions.“The flagrant disregard for the preventative measures was so obvious that – it bears repeating – the defendant’s own son, senator Flávio Nantes Bolsonaro, decided to delete the post from his Instagram account in order to conceal the legal transgression,” Moraes wrote.The arrest order is part of an ongoing supreme court case in which Bolsonaro is accused of leading a plot to overturn the results of the last election, in which current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva defeated the former army captain.The trial is expected to conclude later this year, with Bolsonaro facing a potential sentence of more than 40 years in prison.“Bolsonaro is being arrested gradually,” said political commentator Fernando Gabeira on GloboNews. “The supreme court, consciously or not, is leading him to prison in stages – to avoid a major shock.”In Brasilía, the political temperature has been rising in recent days, with thousands of Bolsonaro supporters on Sunday rallying outside the central bank to offer their support.Many of those protesters urged the US president Donald Trump – whorecently hit Brazil with 50% tariffsin retribution for the alleged “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro – to take further action to help save their embattled leader.“I’d like to give Trump a hug and tell him: thank you for worrying about us,” said Álvaro Junior, 64, one Bolsonaro supporter who was carrying a sign that read: “Thank you, Trump”.Metal barricades have been erected around the supreme court, foreign ministry and congress in anticipation of possible rightwing protests or violence.Trump further stoked the political flames last week by slapping sanctions on Moraes, who the US secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent, accused of being “responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights and politicized prosecutions – including against former president Jair Bolsonaro”.Lindovaldo Ribeiro Paulo, a 43-year-old in a red Maga cap, hailed the sanctions on Moraes, saying: “We feel even more admiration and even love for the American people now.”In Monday’s ruling, Moraes said Bolsonaro had “repeated his unlawful conduct in an even more severe and defiant manner”, continuing to “urge and incite a foreign head of state to take measures aimed at unlawfully interfering with the normal course of judicial proceedings – in an attempt to generate social pressure on Brazilian authorities, in flagrant violation of national sovereignty”.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s hope the BBC have something more fitting lined up to mark its 80th anniversary than Jordan Dunbar’s documentaryLucy ManganMon 4 Aug 2025 16.00 EDTShareLast year, the documentary Atomic People told the stories of some of the survivors of the nuclear bombs dropped in 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Most of them nonagenarians, some in their hundreds, they described with unfaltering clarity their experiences of being caught in the blast. They talked of people coming towards them with organs spilling forth, skin peeling off, one carrying a baby “burned black as stone”, and of lives lived thereafter with knowledge that threatened to corrode them from the inside. Some of the estimated 78,000 who died instantly, out of a population of 350,000, left what looked like shadows against the buildings. Others were vaporised without even that tiny trace. Thousands more would die of radiation sickness by the end of the year, and then would begin the long tail of deaths from cancer caused by direct exposure and mutations passed down to later generations. Survivors were known as “hibakusha”, discouraged from speaking about their awful experiences, and were to varying degrees shunned thereafter, finding it difficult to marry and to find employment as people feared to let them “taint” their families or face the horror they embodied.It was a harrowing, strangely ethereal and delicate 90 minutes of film, as interviewees remembered what their cities were like before the bombs, before the silver shimmer of the B-29 they all recall was first glimpsed against the clear blue sky. They closed their eyes and the very earliest days of childhood lived again. The documentary did not mark any particular anniversary – simply the fact that time was running out for these people, silenced for so long, to tell their stories, allowing them to function, in so far as is ever possible, as the warnings from history they want to pass on.The half-hour of What Happened at Hiroshima, marking the 80th anniversary of the bombings, feels, by contrast, like a rushed, crass thing – a duty done, a commissioning box ticked and a presenter, the journalist Jordan Dunbar, required to try to make up for its slightness by emoting instead. For many, perhaps, this will be the appropriate mode of delivery. I, however – ancient, intolerant, embittered on top of natural cynicism and reserve – still feel it as an unnecessary intrusion into a piece. Detachment and stoicism is what allows others’ stories to be thrown into the sharp, stark relief they deserve. Anything else, I think, pulls focus and does a disservice to the viewer and, more importantly, the subjects.The 30-minute run time is simply too short for such a topic. Take off the introductory few minutes (where they tell you what you’re going to tell you) and the last (where they tell you what they’ve told you) and there is precious little time left to tell anything at all. We skim the preceding history (the Tripartite Pact, 1940! Pearl Harbor, 1941! The B-29 was called the Enola Gay!), then take in a few memories from the quartet of survivors interviewed. We watch Dunbar, visibly moved, in a museum dedicated to the bombings , the room filled with a panoramic photograph of the cities’ devastation. Then we take a brief look at the Cuban missile crisis and estimates of how many nuclear missiles are hunkered and bunkered round the world today – in case we thought the threat had receded.We’re left with just enough time for a furrowed brow and a bathetic comment that the people in charge may not be listening to survivors’ stories. When this generation is gone, asks Dunbar, will our leaders really understand what it means to push the button? This is where my patience really ran out. To descend to this level of asininity after the quiet dignity and appalling suffering recounted by contributors representing such a colossal, profound, world-changing event simply won’t do.I’m going to be charitable and assume that this is not going to be our national broadcaster’s only contribution towards marking the 80th anniversary of one of the worst atrocities in human history, of the dawn of a new age whose darkness and horrors have somehow had to have been accommodated within all of us since, wearing callouses on our souls. I’m going to assume there is something more fitting coming along. Perhaps this programme was intended for a younger, more tender demographic than mine and I am judging it by entirely the wrong criteria. I hope so. But I also hope that we can always distinguish between the need to reach and educate new audiences and the impulse to do so by pandering to them.What Happened at Hiroshima aired on BBC One and is available on iPlayer.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryFactual TVJapanSecond world warreviewsShareReuse this content"

Can’t Look Away tells a devastating story of bereft parents trying to hold the likes of Snapchat to accountCath ClarkeMon 4 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 11.27 EDTShareIn 2020, Amy Neville found her 14-year-old son Alexander dead in his bedroom. He had taken what he thought was an oxycodone pill, bought – according to Neville – from a drug dealer he met on Snapchat. The pill was a fake, laced with fentanyl. Four years later, his mum stood up in the California high school where Alex would have been a student to warn other parents and teenagers about social media. “We give our kids these smartphones. We let them have these apps. And that is the equivalent of dropping them off in the worst neighbourhood in our area.”Neville is featured alongside other bereaved parents in Can’t Look Away, a terrifying new documentary about kids and social media directed by Matthew O’Neill and Perri Peltz, based on extensive investigative reporting by Bloomberg News journalist Olivia Carville. It follows American families who are filing lawsuits against social media companies and campaigning for stricter legislation; they are represented by the Social Media Victims Law Center, a crusading legal firm run Matthew Bergman, a lawyer so charismatic he could probably play himself in a Hollywood movie.The directors ask if the kids have ever watched a suicide. Almost every hand goes upThe conversation around teenagers and social media has evolved beyond kids using their phones at the table.In his 2024 bestseller The Anxious Generation, Jonathan Haidt warned of the links betweenyoung people’s mental health and smartphones. Last month, the technology secretary Peter Kyle apologised for the delay in legislation to keep children safe online.Australia plans to ban social media for under 16s from December.In Can’t Look Away, the agony on parents’ faces as they tell their stories, and relive the trauma, is hard to watch. Toney and Brandy Roberts filed a lawsuit against Meta over the death of their 14-year-old daughter Englyn in 2020; she killed herself after watching a video of a mock-hanging on Instagram. “The social media companies know that our children are so vulnerable,” Brandy tells the camera. “I feel that the only way that they’re going to be forced to change is through a lawsuit. So that’s why we’re joining this fight.”‘The tide has turned’: why parents are suing US social media firms after their children’s deathRead moreWhen I talk to the film’s directors before Can’t Look Away’s UK premiere, they do not mince their words. O’Neill says he previously had no idea how extreme the content that children are exposed to on social media is. “It’s so much more than just addiction, or screen time, or wasting time. What young people see is so different because of the algorithms. What they’re being fed, what they can’t look away from, this is not what they’re searching for. Children are essentially entering into a hellscape that adults don’t know about.”Algorithms decide what you see on social media, based in part on what you have previously liked or commented on, and how much time you’ve spent on other posts. If you linger on a piece of content, the algorithm will feed you more of the same. What that means is that teenagers don’t have to actively search for harmful material for it to appear in their feed. A 13-year-old girl might look for healthy eating advice and end up down a rabbit hole of pro-anorexia content. “It can very quickly turn very dark,” says O’Neill.Mason Edens was 16 when he broke up with his girlfriend; normal teenage stuff his mum Jennie DeSerio thought. In his heartache, Mason turned to TikTok, searching for phrases such as: “My girlfriend broke up with me.” In the film, his mum plays one of the depressing videos that ended up in his feed. It shows a gun in a hand, then an image of blood splatter and the words: “My hand. My head.” Mason killed himself in November 2022. Jennie doesn’t believe that he’d ever searched for the term “suicide” on TikTok.O’Neill says he was shocked by Mason’s feed: “This is not someone crying. It’s not just sad music. It is an image of a gun going into a hand with the exhortation to blow your effing head off. That is not content that a product should be feeding to a child. I think we could all broadly agree on that as a society.”Is it possible, I ask, for the social media companies to filter out harmful content? “If Meta knows what I want to buy before I buy it, there’s no way they can’t figure out how to make sure children aren’t fed content that demonstrates how to die by suicide.”View image in fullscreen‘It can turn dark very quickly’ … the directors of the documentary, Matthew O’Neill and Perri Peltz.Photograph: Bryan Derballa/Getty ImagesAfter screenings of Can’t Look Away, the film-makers often ask the kids in the audience if they have ever watched a suicide on social media. “Almost all the hands go up,” says co-director Peltz.In America, 95% of 13 to 17-year-olds use social media. In 2022, social media companies made an estimated $11bn from advertising directed to under 18s in the US. The longer kids are glued to it, the more billions the companies make, which means there is a huge incentive to design sticky algorithms, says Peltz. “Why are they feeding children material that they can’t look away from? Because it keeps children on their sites for as long as possible. And we know from whistleblowers that that is a business plan. This is not an accident. They are prioritising time on screen over safety.”The film features interviews with such whistleblowers, who say companies have been warned that their products harm children. Arturo Béjar held senior positions at Facebook and Instagram, and became increasingly alarmed by their parent company Meta’s own research. In one poll, one in eight 13 to 15-year-olds said they had received an unwanted sexual advance on Instagram in the past week. Béjar emailed his concerns to Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and other top executives. He says he never received a reply.Can’t Look Away tells the heart-breaking story of Jordan DeMay, a popular, outgoing 17-year-old from Michigan who killed himself after being blackmailed in a sextortion scam. In March 2022, he received a message on Instagram from someone he thought was a girl his own age. After some flirting, Jordan sent her nude photographs. Immediately, the threats started: send money or we’ll share the photos with your friends and family. Less than six hours after the first of these messages, Jordan was dead.Sextortion is one of the fastest growing cybercrimes. Peltz is keen to share with parents the advice she has picked up from several professionals about how to protect children. “Talk to your child. Tell them, ‘If this ever happens to you, do not be afraid to come to us.’ It’s very specific advice that can make a major difference.”View image in fullscreenShowdown … parents demonstrate outside the HQ of Snap Inc, the maker of Snapchat.Photograph: Courtesy: Can’t Look AwayCan’t Look Away ends with some real-life courtroom drama in Los Angeles. Amy Neville, the woman whose son took the fake oxycodone pill, is the lead plaintiff in a case against Snapchat by parents whose children died or were injured after allegedly buying fentanyl-laced drugs. Their lawsuit claims that Snapchat’s design makes it an ideal marketplace to sell illegal drugs, with its disappearing messages that make it difficult for police to trace illegal activity. Another feature is Quick Add, which suggests other users to add. Laura Marquez-Garrett is a lawyer at the Social Media Victims Law Center and explains how it works. “[A dealer will] just find one high school kid in your area. You add them, and then you add all their friends, and then you addtheirfriends.”In a courtroom showdown, Snap Inc’s defence relies on a piece of US legislation drafted before Zuckerberg hit puberty. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has for years acted as a shield (or a get-out-of-jail card, depending on your perspective) protecting social media companies from liability for user-generated content posted on their platforms. In court, Snap Inc’s attorney describes the platform as a tech-service provider, like a phone company. You wouldn’t sue a phone company if a drug deal was made over the phone. The back-and-forth between the lawyers and the judge is a gripping intellectual tennis match.‘No smartphones before 14; no social media until 16’: The Anxious Generation author on how to fight back against big techRead morePeltz tells me that parents often feel powerless. “But this is not a blame-the-parents situation. Companies need to make the changes so that these sites are responsible and are safe for children to be on. Parents can’t be expected to keep up with their children when it comes to digital advances. It’s time for these companies to stop blaming parents.”As for teenagers, people can be judgmental, she says. “I think it’s human nature to say, ‘Well my child wouldn’t buy drugs online.’ Or, ‘My child couldn’t be sextorted.’ The answer is that we can all hope that our children won’t do things like that. But children are children. We all know about the frontal cortex, that it doesn’t get fully developed until your 20s. Children make mistakes. They should be allowed to make mistakes and not have to die as a result.”Can’t Look Away: The Case Against Social Media is in UK cinemas and streaming onjolt.filmfrom 8 AugustIn the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Fever-dreamed by Canadian clowning duo Creepy Boys, this absurd existential rave is brilliantly smart and beautifully stupid.Wriggling on to the stage in sleeping bags with puffy vulval gaps for their faces and arms, Sam Kruger and SE Grummett insist, with increasing desperation, that this is a show about nothing. No serious topic will be tackled here. Not gun violence, not climate change, not gender identity. Creepy Boys want to take those heavy, stressful “somethings” and stomp on them while we dance to techno and watch a soothing puppet show instead. When the eggshell-ridden world outside is so hard to navigate, don’t we deserve some smooth-brained blankness? Like slugs: the ultimate nothing.View image in fullscreen‘Mostly gross’ … Sam Kruger and SE Grummett in Slugs.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianBut sticking to this nothingness proves difficult. Whenever the pair stray into a topic that threatens to be “a something” they retreat, flailing into a cesspit of panic that they’ve ruined the show. Stripped down to bright, tight plastic bibs and free-wheeling genitals, they frantically cover their close-calls with sweaty, delirious misdirections of our attention: Joni Mitchell puppetry; live animations; a two-headed horse. As it becomes harder to stay in the safe zone, every word, body part and casually shoved-in-your-face gun becomes riddled with unavoidably political connotations.The pair admit their work is “a little bit niche and mostly gross” but this howl of a show uses an anarchic, DIY aesthetic to cloak innovative design and complex Derridian concepts. What begins as an effort to distract from the doom-scroll mentality devolves into a critical analysis of the absurdities we accept as the norm. In a world so unruly, theirs seems the only sane response.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)ClownsSummerhallTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Viewers are all enjoying the One Day-meets-High Fidelity vibes ofBBC Two’s nostalgic romance Mix Tape. However, none of them can stand the cassette-crossed lovers’ spouses. Yes, for every role that becomes a firm viewer favourite, another is reviled by the show’s fanbase. Lena Dunham’s latest creation, Too Much, seems to be entirely populated by unappealing characters.Meanwhile, Peppa Pig devotees are in a porcine pickle over the imminent onscreenarrival of a new little sister, baby piglet Evie. Cartoon swine devotees fear this gimmicky addition will upset the delicate balance of the four-way family unit that has been beloved by preschoolers for 21 years. If the oinking blockbuster ain’t broke, why fix it?The current hate figures won’t be the last to spoil a successful programme. We name and shame the unlucky 13 characters who ruined TV shows …Che Diaz(And Just Like That)View image in fullscreenDivisive … Che Diaz (Sara Ramirez) in And Just Like That.Photograph: Craig Blankenhorn/© 2023 WarnerMedia Direct, LLC. All Rights ReservedVanity Fair dubbed the character “divisive”. The New York Times called them “polarising”. Just two of the euphemisms for being downright awful. As Miranda’s love interest in the Sex and the City sequel, so-called comedian Che was much maligned as an unsubtle caricature of a non-binary person. The character simply made no sense, let alone as a match for the hitherto heterosexual Miranda. They spoke as if they had swallowed a gender studies textbook. They laughed at their own non-jokes. They generally jarred with fans. Some feel similarly about Carrie’s rekindled relationship with Aidan, with his mullet, whispery tones and cringe-inducing phone sex. Shudder.Bran Stark(Game of Thrones)View image in fullscreenWidely reviled … Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) in Game of Thrones.Photograph: Courtesy of HBOThat noise isn’t dire wolves; it’s howls of protest from fans. The problematically named “Bran the Broken” spent most of HBO’s fantasy saga on the sidelines – wearing furs, sitting in trees and making gnomic pronouncements like a creepy schoolkid in the corner of the playground. He even disappeared for an entire season and wasn’t much missed. No wonder it was, ahem, “controversial” when this passive fringe figure was suddenly picked as Ruler of the Six Kingdoms. A widely reviled choice.Uncle Albert (Only Fools and Horses)With mega-rated Christmas specials and a dodgy lock-up full of lovely jubbly catchphrases, the Trotter brothers once ruled the sitcom roost. Cushty. While they ducked ’n’ dived around Peckham, Grandad rarely left his armchair in Nelson Mandela House but added a bass note of world-weary, hat-clad, croaky-voiced craftiness. When the actor Lennard Pearce died in 1984, he was replaced by the wackier Uncle Albert – a salty old sea dog with Captain Birds Eye’s beard and precisely one joke, which was starting every sentence with “During the war … ” The decline began, hastened by Del finding love with Raquel and Rodders falling for Cassandra. You plonkers.Scrappy-Doo (Scooby-Doo)View image in fullscreenInsufferable brat … Scrappy-Doo with Shaggy and Scooby-Doo.Photograph: PictureLux/The Hollywood Archive/Alamy“Puppy power! Lemme at ’em, Uncle Scoob! Scrappy dappy Doo!” Pipe down, you insufferable brat. When the Hanna-Barbera cartoon suffered a ratings slump, producers brought in Scooby’s rambunctious nephew to join the ghost-hunting gang as an uncalled-for comic foil. The annoying ankle-biter sparked an immediate backlash. “Zoinks,” indeed. Scrappy was so hated that The Simpsons mocked him with the rapping, surfing Poochie in cartoon-within-a-cartoon The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show.Emily Waltham(Friends)View image in fullscreenUnfunny wet blanket … Helen Baxendale (right) with David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston in Friends.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyCrowbarring a token British actor into an American show rarely works. So it proved when Helen Baxendale earned a big-money transfer from Cold Feet to Friends. Intended to turn the Ross ’n’ Rachel saga into a love triangle, Emily was an unfunny wet blanket who just got in the way. She spent most of her screen time storming out of rooms in jealous huffs. Her arrival led to the ropy London episodes, complete with cameos from Sarah Ferguson and Richard Branson. Emily’s sole saving grace: the gasp-inducing moment when Ross accidentally said Rachel’s name at the altar. Pivot!Nate Shelley (Ted Lasso)View image in fullscreenMore ‘Grate’ than ‘Great’ … Nick Mohammed as Nathan Shelley in Ted Lasso.Photograph: APThe Apple TV+ hit is a feelgood sports-com about teamwork, optimism and compassion. Did it really need to turn one of its supporting characters into an unconvincing panto villain? Shortly after arriving to manage AFC Richmond, our titular hero spotted the kit man’s tactical nous, promoted him to assistant coach and nicknamed him Nate the Great. How did Nate repay him? By demanding all the credit for Richmond’s success, bullying colleagues and mocking his mentor’s panic attacks – before leaving to manage the club’s arch rival. Nate the Grate, more like.The Moon family(Frasier)Physiotherapist-cum-housekeeper Daphne Moon may have been lovable, but whenever her family from back home in Blighty turned up, it was painful to behold. Her brother Simon was a regular visitor to Seattle, appearing in nine episodes as a boozy, boorish numpty, but the actor Anthony LaPaglia inexplicably spoke in a ropy cockney accent, rather than a more logical Mancunian one. Even more inexplicably, he won an Emmy for the role. Equally bad was their battleaxe mother, Gertrude (Millicent Martin).Dana Brody (Homeland)View image in fullscreenSoapy teens … Morgan Saylor as Dana Brody with Timothée Chalamet as Finn Walden in Homeland.Photograph: Kent Smith/ShowtimeThe Showtime series was a tense, knotty espionage thriller about the cat-and-mouse relationship between CIA spook Carrie Mathison and Marine-turned-al-Qaida sleeper agent Sgt Nicholas Brody. Homeland wasn’t an angsty teen soap. Yet this is exactly what it turned into during scenes involving Brody’s sulking, whining daughter Dana. She at least met her petulant match in the vice-president’s hit-and-run driver son Finn, played by a 16-year-old Timothée Chalamet. Wonder what happened to that guy? In other “annoying offspring of TV action men” news, see Jack Bauer’s daughter Kim from 24 – notably when she got trapped in a snare and menaced by a wild cougar. Dammit, Jack!Andy Bernard (The Office US)The Office: An American Workplace wasn’t just a rare US remake worthy of the British original. It became a truly great sitcom in its own right. Cracks appeared, however, when Dunder Mifflin boss Michael Scott departed and preppy sales rep Andy Bernard was promoted to regional manager. Arrogant and anger prone, he lacked Michael’s bumbling humanity and drained the show of its gentle charm. It was like replacing David Brent with Finchy.Henrik Sabroe(The Bridge)View image in fullscreenHandsome but haunted … Thure Lindhardt as Henrik Sabroe in The Bridge.The first two series of the border-straddling Nordic noir were all-timers, following the unlikely duo of neurodiverse Swedish sleuth Saga Norén and her slobby, sarky Danish counterpart Martin Rohde. When the second run ended with Martin jailed, Saga needed a new sidekick, hence the arrival of the handsome but haunted Henrik. The pair soon entered into a relationship (eyeroll). With more focus on the detectives’ private lives, the crime drama lost its way. Back to Sarah Lund’s jumpers, then.Elsbeth Tascioni(The Good Wife)View image in fullscreenKooky … Carrie Preston as Elsbeth Tascioni in The Good Wife.Recurring character Elsbeth was a Chicago defence attorney for whom words such as “quirky” and “kooky” might have been invented. All “I’m so random!” pronouncements and primary-coloured outfits, she was a tryhard irritant who somehow became a fan favourite. Amid the high-class legal drama, it felt as if she had wandered in from a tonally different, inferior show. Which she then got, landing her own spin-off, the Ronseal-titled Elsbeth. There’s no accounting for taste.Cousin Oliver (The Brady Bunch)View image in fullscreenSpawned a syndrome … Cousin Oliver (Robbie Rist) in The Brady Bunch.The disastrous introduction of this previously unmentioned Brady family member coined the US terms “Cousin Oliver syndrome” and “add-a-kid” – shorthand for a failed bid to boost flagging ratings with a supposedly cute child. This blond, bespectacled devil spawn is among the most hated characters in sitcom history. Six episodes after Oliver’s arrival, ABC axed the show. A decade later came another example: Sam, the bowl-cut best friend of Gary Coleman’s Arnold, who joined the Diff’rent Strokes cast for its final two series. It might take diff’rent strokes to move the world, but Sam could do one.The Man in Black(Lost)View image in fullscreenOut to confuse … Titus  Welliver as The Man in Black, AKA John Locke, in Lost.Photograph: PRThe pointless polar bear. The hatch. The Others. The Dharma Initiative. The giant foot statue, Jack’s tattoos. Flashbacks, flash-forwards and sideways flashes. There were many points at which the plane crash drama disappeared up its own rear propeller but the clincher came when a middle-aged man in black became the personification of evil. He had previously appeared as the Smoke Monster, then was able to inhabit the dead. He turned out to be the villainous twin of the mysterious Jacob, white-clad protector of “The Heart of the Island”. All clear? Thought not.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionLostfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That feel like athleisure, but present as tailoring,” wrote Jess. “It’s like a cheat code to life!” (And for any men reading, Peter Bevan recommendeda very similar pairin hisAugust style essentials.)The sober spritzView image in fullscreenNozeco alcohol-free spritz£19.50 for six x 75cl bottles at AmazonLove Aperol spritz, but fancy something new?

The Normanby specimen is still spectacular: it has beaten the 21in “Dorset mega-rat” of 2018.But it’s dead, you say,so we can go back to ourgiant-rodent-free lives?We certainly can’t hope for rodent-free lives. “It is a growing problem,”local councillor David Taylor said, blaming overflowing public bins and overgrown vegetation, among other factors.So, it’s a Normanby problem. Phew.Nope, it’s a great time to be a rat globally.Research on rat numbers published in Januaryfound that rising temperatures and population mean 11 global cities are experiencing significant increases in rat numbers: 390% in Washington DC, 300% in San Francisco and 186% in Toronto, which is reported to be experiencing a “perfect rat storm”, according to a city councillor.New York reportedly has 3 million Remys running around, hence the city appointing a “rat tsar”.How aboutin the UK?Well, the same conditions that allow rats to thrive elsewhere – warmer temperatures, increasing urban populations creating more waste – apply here. Andcuts hitting bin collectionsaren’t helping. Therecent Birmingham bin strikeapparently created a rat “banquet” of refuse.And how bad are rats, exactly?They can destroy infrastructure and contaminate food supplies (costingan estimated $27bn in the US alone) and carry about 50 zoonotic (that’s transmissible to humans) diseases and parasites, such as salmonella and leptospirosis. Research also shows they have anegative impact on the mental healthof people affected by infestations.Ratatouillewas a lie. What can we do?Rats are highly fertile (theoretically, they can conceive every 25 days), mobile and adaptable andcan survive on as little as an ounce of food a day, so not much. Management strategies involve poisoning, trapping and trying to limit their food sources – and New York City and other places are experimenting withrat birth control– but we are fighting a losing battle.Do say:“The Normanby mega-rat is an outlier – most rats are only 6-11in long.”Don’t say:“Good luck shoving that under your chef’s hat.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesAnimalsAnimal behaviourNorth YorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s a frightening recipe for more stasis and more rageMon 4 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 07.47 EDTShareAnew party has launched in the UK, and it didn’t take long for it to become the subject of frantic speculation. Will it split the left? Will it create more of an opening for Reform UK? Should itforge an alliancewith the Greens? The stunning speed with which Jeremy Corbyn’s new party amassed supporters, nowstanding at 600,000in a week, reasonably makes it feel like a real and viable thing. And the next logical step is to assess its chances in meaningfully challenging the mainstream. But the bigger question is, can the mainstream be meaningfully challenged, or is the future one of increasing fragmentation, with a persistent but tense monopoly on power by the political establishment?The signs that the centre is fraying at the margins became clear at the last general election. There was ahistorically low turnoutby share of the population (resulting in themost disproportionateelection outcome in history), Labour won its lowest share of the vote among those in deprived areas, and up came a new crop of independent MPs and Reform winners.Since then, the already “broad but shallow” mandate given to Labour has diminished even more, with approval ratings dropping the most for any governing party within its first year sinceJohn Major’s disasterin the 1990s. And internally, araft of suspensionsover the welfare reform bill continue to expose a party struggling even to maintain satisfaction within its own ranks. This is not a stable state of affairs, but it could very likely be a sustainable one. Because even as establishments rot and lose public support, they still benefit from scale and deep roots within the governing and electoral system – there’s a reason it’s called an “establishment”. Combine this with no proportional representation, and you have a situation where numbers do not necessarily translate into seats.Cycling between two mainstream parties, both out of ideas and solutions for everything from the cost of living to foreign policy, has led to a state of repetitive disaffection. The story in the US is the same. The Democrats were rejected for a second time in eight years in favour of Donald Trump, but Trump himself is now posting thelowest approval ratingof his second term. Neither centrists nor rightwingers can deliver, and yet their parties squat and sprawl on the site of government, with high barriers to entry precluding outside challenge and disincentivising internal reform. This is a recipe for permanent disconnect; failing governments, angry protest movements on the right and the left, quirky election results – and no change. Those individuals who break through, fromZohran Mamdaniin New York to independent MPs in the UK, instead of alerting the parties they are closest to that the political net must be widened, are in fact actively fought against. The most senior Democrats in the House of Representatives havestill not endorsedMamdani.View image in fullscreenJeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana on a picket line outside London Euston train station in 2022.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAAnd why would they if they can stay in their political comfort zone, then win again on their own terms when the disenchantment with Trump kicks in proper, and the cycle resets? In the meantime, the sort of vexation that coalesces around figures such as Mamdani and the UK’s new party means that they inherit a gigantic burden of expectation. It is one that is impossible to fulfil, because frustration with mainstream parties is so high that new ones, unless they become constant foghorns channeling feelings of anger rather than political projects, will have to constantly manage being the voice of outrage against the government, as well as working out how to be the alternative.Adding to the clamouring appetite for sharp challenge is a new information ecosystem where there are now more ways to dispute mainstream accounts of political reality. The process of fragmentation combined with persistent monopoly is one that is mirrored in the media. Over the past two years alone, entire outlets have grown and flourished over what it seems is the media’s inability to adequately capture and express anger over Gaza. From Zeteo (dubbed a “breakout hit”) toDrop Site News, which launched only a year ago, now has almost 400,000 subscribers and closely works with journalists in Gaza, there is a vast appetite for more uncompromising discourse and intimate coverage of the Middle East and complicity on Gaza.Still, this has not diminished anger at mainstream outlets because it is understood that these organisations still have enormous reach and therefore power over public opinion, and by extension political outcomes. It is why the New York Times’s reports on starvation in Gaza have been heavily contested by pro-Israeli government voices, as the paper holds huge authority in the one country that has power over Israel.Despite the chaos of its launch, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve | Andy BeckettRead moreBut all that residual power, from politics to the media, does not change the fact that something big is up for grabs – the default belief that these establishment institutions deserve their power, whether it can be taken away from them or not. Talk about new leftwing movements empowering Reform or the threat to the Labour government (talk that we have been hearing since before the last general election) misses the broader point – it’s too late. Labour is running on inertia, legacy, and historical and physical entrenchment, rather than active belief in the party. It has long given up on shaping public opinion, rather following, headless, what cynical politicians have forged, and economic and geopolitical realities have created. It is now a mutant party that is chasing Reform voters by trying (and failing) to outflank Nigel Farage, while trying to win over pro-Gaza opinion with a bizarre threat torecognise Palestineif Israel does not agree to a ceasefire. As well as trying to continue austerity while putting out the fires that it causes.There are two ways in which new parties and movements can produce results. The first is by actually being in government, and the second is by gathering enough support that they can apply pressure on government. The second is a more immediate and tangible way forward, but the problem is that the scale and range of what incumbent parties have failed to address, or take control of, is now too wide and polarised for any outside pressure to create breakthrough.The risk now is of a sort of permanent bifurcation. On the one hand, increasingly out-of-control hysteria on immigration empowers ghouls like Farage and makes them and their poisonous rhetoric permanent features of our lives and politics, while rage over Gaza and economic policies constantly clouds the political atmosphere. On the other, a government is caught in the headlights, unable to tackle anything, while also hoping that it’s too big to fail and its opponents too small and diverse to succeed. What if the problem isn’t that the centre cannot hold, but that it can, and in doing so brings about a new, volatile, miserable status quo of escalating rage and impotent government?Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourReform UKJeremy CorbynZarah SultanacommentShareReuse this content"

There must be a reckoningMon 4 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 14.16 EDTShareNothing is more insufferable than someone saying “I told you so”; so please forgive me for being insufferable. On 29 September 2023, after a couple of months spent in the US, Ipublished a columnthat was well summarised in its Guardian headline: “Unless Joe Biden stands aside, the world must prepare for President Trump 2.0”. We can never definitely say “what would have happened if …?”, but there’s a very good chance that had Biden cleared the way for a Democratic primary in autumn 2023 the strongest candidate could have defeated Trump. The entire world would have been spared the disaster now unfolding.“No use crying over spilt milk,” you may say. Yes, but it’s always worth learning lessons for the future. I’m back in the US now, and arecent pollfor the Wall Street Journal found that 63% of voters hold an unfavourable view of the Democratic party. To put it mildly, the Democrats have a way to go.So what, given all that is happening and everything we now know, are the right lessons? The point of mentioning my old column is not to boast of some special insider insight into Washington high politics; the point is precisely that I had none. It was just obviously crazy to put up a visibly old and frail candidate who would be 86 years old by the end of his second term. For comparison, the leaders of the Soviet Union who we think of as the epitome of decrepit gerontocracy were, at their respective moments of unlamented demise, 75 (Leonid Brezhnev), 69 (Yuri Andropov) and 73 (Konstantin Chernenko).It required no special knowledge to see this and most Americans already did. By the time I wrote my column, an opinion poll had found that77% of Americansthought Biden was too old to be president for another four years. It was only the political insiders, the liberal commentariat, the Democratic establishment, who went on agreeing with the president, his family and what was (you couldn’t make this up) actually known informally as the “politburo” of his closest advisers that he was the only man for the job.In their recent, much noticed book,Original Sin, two leading Washington journalists, CNN’sJake TapperandAlex Thompsonof Axios, argue that there was, as their subtitle suggests, a cover up. Biden’s family and the politburo tried to hide his precipitate cognitive decline, confining most of his meetings to between 10am and 4pm. Even cabinet members did not see him up close for many months and in-depth media interviews were as rare as a Pride parade in the Vatican.The authors generously apportion blame to the president, his wife, other family members and his closest advisers, but there’s one set of people they curiously spare: themselves and their fellow Washington insider journalists. Now, I haven’t gone back over all their reporting on CNN and Axios, and there are certainlysome piecesthat should be cited to defend their journalistic record. But there is no doubt that American political journalists in general, and the liberal commentariat in particular, were slow and late to say what most “ordinary” Americans had long since seen.Why? The New York Times writer Ezra Klein digs into this inan episodeof his excellent podcast. Frankly acknowledging that his own February 2024 call for Biden to stand aside was “late”, Klein explores in conversation with Tapper why most others were even later. The answer seems to be a mix of ingredients: journalistic fear of losing access; the vindictive tribalism of the Democratic establishment; deference to an imperial presidency; fear of Donald Trump; worry about Kamala Harris as the presumptive alternative candidate.Fear of losing access is a professional disease of journalism. “You felt like you were destroying all of your relationships with the White House all at once,” says Klein, recalling his February 2024 demarche. “Yes, not just with the White House but the Democratic party,” adds Tapper. My own September 2023 notebook sums up a private conversation with a Washington-based columnist: “Yes, Biden should stand aside. He [the columnist] can’t say it.” (My note continues: “Jill Biden could, but she likes it.”)I know, also from other sources, just how threatening the Democratic establishment could be when trying to close down any questioning of Biden’s fitness to serve a second term. Even in the critical articles that did appear in US media there was a kind of residual deference to the presidency, almost as though they were asking a king to abdicate rather than just another politician to stand aside. Partly this stems from the 237-year-old US constitutional device of rolling your prime minister and monarch into one. In Britain, we confine our residual deference to the monarch while the prime minister gets roasted every Wednesday at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons. Someone in Biden’s 2023 state of dotage wouldn’t have survived two weeks in Westminster.Then there’s the fact that people were already panicking about Trump and it was somehow thought, especially after Democratic successes in the 2022 midterm elections, that Biden was the only guy to beat him. The more so since the presumptive alternative was Harris, who was seen as a relatively weak candidate. And so, for fear of getting Harris and then Trump, they got Harris and then Trump.The simple way Democrats should talk about Trump and Epstein | Peter RothpletzRead moreSome lessons, then, are clear. Tapper and Thompson open their book with a quotation from George Orwell: “To see what is in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle.” But Orwell also calls on us always to say what we do see, even if – no, especially if – it’s uncomfortable for our own side. There’s the double test for journalists: see it and say it.For the Democratic establishment: don’t try to intimidate the media into self-censorship with the argument that they are giving succour to the enemy. You would have been better served by journalists just doing their job, in the spirit of Orwell. Then: change out your old guard. Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, is older than Chernenko and rapidly catching up on Brezhnev. Oh yes, and simply listen to the people you’re meant to represent.The tragedy of this whole story is that the Democrats have a profusion of talent in younger generations – fromPete Buttigieg,Josh Shapiro,Gretchen WhitmerandGavin Newsomto New York’s new star,Zohran Mamdani. They don’t yet have the shared platform that could win a presidential election, but thinkers such as Klein and Derek Thompson, co-authors ofAbundance,the other book of the moment, are already working up some good ideas. The Democrats can probably swing the House of Representatives in the midterm elections next year with a few fresh faces – and by focusing on the already visible negative consequences of Trump for working- and middle-class Americans. But by 2027, in the run-up to the next presidential election, they will need everything they so spectacularly failed to produce in 2023.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJoe BidenOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsDemocratsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

If an effective remedy had existed back then, I would have jumped at itMon 4 Aug 2025 12.57 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 13.16 EDTShareIf there was a five-minute nuclear warning, I’d run straight to my local shop and buy a pack of cigarettes. Even now, after all these years. I stopped more than a decade ago – note that I say “stopped” rather than “gave up” because the latter implies a sacrifice, and I have been brainwashed (OK, hypnotised) not to use the term. But you are never really a non-smoker. You are just a smoker who is currently not smoking. In your soul, you are forever one of the people who leave the table after eating to go and have a conversation outside, even if you physically stay put these days.So, as someone who found it difficult to quit, it’s baffling to hear that although two stop-smoking medications have been available in the UK since 2024, only 0.2% of those attempting to give up have used them, according to ananalysisof NHS data onsmoking in England.Cytisine (which also goes by cytisinicline) is a plant-based product that has been used in eastern Europe since the 70s and may appeal to those who prefer a natural option over a synthetic drug. It mimics the effects of nicotine, and tricks your brain into thinking you’ve had a cigarette. Varenicline – withdrawn in 2021 over concerns about impurities, but now reformulated and rereleased – can apparently reduce the urge to smoke, make you enjoy it less when you do and ease withdrawal symptoms.I tried everything when it came to my struggle with Silk Cut. Patches, gum, lozenges – I carried on smoking while I wore, chewed and sucked them all. I read the world-famous success story The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr (no,not that one). I attended the NHS in-person sessions, three times, to no effect. I was a triple failure, and oddly proud of it for a reason I still don’t quite understand.I had neurolinguistic programming, where the man shook my hand as he greeted me, asking, “And how long was it that you smoked for?”“Oh, I still smoke now. I just had one outside,” I volunteered cheerfully.He tutted and told me that for some clients, talking about smoking in the past tense like that was all it took. I scoffed at those weaklings as I walked to my train afterwards – in a cloud of smoke, obviously.I know judging other parents is wrong. But when it comes to giving kids smartphones, I’m a lost cause | Polly HudsonRead moreThe closest I came to victory back then was a hypnotist recommended by a friend, with the caveat that he sounded so much like Cliff Richard it was hard to take him seriously. She didn’t mention that he worked out of an extremely insalubrious portable cabin at the back of a building site. As I knocked on the tin-can door (while simultaneously putting out yet another last ever cigarette), I reasoned that if he murdered me, I would technically have given up smoking, therefore this would have been a success.Reader, he did not murder me. In gentle, dulcet tones, he told me I felt sleepy, while I felt embarrassed for him because I definitely wasn’t hypnotised. When he “brought me round” he asked me how long I thought I’d “been under”. I’d been thinking about what to have for dinner the whole time, so stifled a giggle as I told him: about 10 minutes. He replied that it had been two hours.The next morning, it occurred to me that I hadn’t even thought about smoking, let alone done it. Thrilled, I sent another friend, who had the same experience. However, a year later, almost to the day, we both started smoking again. I went back for a do-over but it didn’t work.In the end, I probably spent about as much on trying to stop smoking as I had on cigarettes, and the thing that finally worked was free: boring old willpower. It wasagony. Personally, I would have bitten the doctor’s hand off if they could have given me a treatment that worked. And while of course no treatment is 100% effective, as I found out, stopping smoking is hard and gruelling. The moreoptions people have, and the more visible and accessible these options are, the better.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

There are no winners in divorce, but maybe, somehow, we can all be happyMon 4 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 07.08 EDTSharePaul Mooney, the late great African-American comedian and one of the most insightful yethilarious intellectualson matters of race, once quipped that every “racially aggrieved” person once deceased returns in another body to collect what is owed to them. Illustrating the point he suggested that the first Black Oscar winner,Hattie McDaniel(perhaps most famous for playing Mammy in Gone With the Wind), had returned to the world as Oprah Winfrey. If Mooney’s thesis is to be believed, there is amusement to be had guessing which figure from history has returned to us in the form of a newly “ex-Nigerian” Olukemi Olufunto Adegoke Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative partyAppearing on a podcast last week, Badenoch said that sheno longer identifiesas Nigerian. This was bizarre even by Badenochian standards. Her words: “I don’t identify with it [Nigeria] any more. Most of my life has been in the UK …” She went further: “I’m Nigerian through ancestry, by birth, despite not being born there because of my parents … but by identity, I’m not really.”The podcast presenter, the former Tory MP and all-round lovely chap Gyles Brandreth, deserves an award for not falling into a laughter-induced coma as Olukemi Olufunto desperately struggled with a self-imposed form of the late Norman Tebbit’s “whose side are you on anyway”cultural loyalty test.Badenoch isn’t a runaway favourite. Just today Liz Truss, momentarily the Tory leader, now the stuff of actual stand-up comedy,accused herof “repeating spurious narratives” about the economy. That’s a bit cats in a true blue sack: but, listening to the leader of the opposition, now and previously, on matters of race and identity, I do find her confused and confusing.For someone keen to shed the weight of Nigerian origins, she appears to make much of them, if negatively. Nigerians in the diaspora tend to obsess about three topics: making money, Premier League football andNigeria. Of this cohort, Badenoch sounds like a recent “Japa” (a person who migrated from Nigeria usually to the west) who just cannot stop talking about “back home”.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch talking about British immigration policy on Fareed Zakaria’s CNN show.Photograph: CNNA few months ago, the theme was ethnic enmity and corruption. Last month, doing the anti-immigration two-step onFareed Zakaria’s CNN show, she said her daughters were unable to attain Nigerian citizenship because “I am a woman”. That was sad: cue violins. But it’s also nonsense. The Nigerian constitutionconfers citizenship on to her childrenby dint of the fact that one of their parents or grandparents is Nigerian – which is actually more liberal and inclusive than the British approach to citizenship.It is infuriating that Badenoch tends not to do interviews with people with knowledge of Nigeria or even honest brokers on the Black experience in Britain. The result is that her more confusing pronouncements – such as the contention she “doesn’t like socialism” because of her experiences in Nigeria – go unchallenged. A clued-up interviewer might say: “I put it to you that Nigeria is one of the most brutally capitalist nations on Earth, one without any real welfare state. You actually grew up in a recently liberated former British colony that was struggling under the weight of history and IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes – the mother of all austerity regimes.” That’s why her response to even the prospect of an appropriate interviewer is to run a one-minute mile.On one level it’s all comedic, but it also seems sadly revealing. The colonial mindset that everything western is unquestionably superior is one that too many Nigerians have yet to discard: especially Nigeria’s political elite.Call it the Kemi Badenoch conundrum: it’s why the Tories are going nowhere fast | Henry HillRead moreThese interviews also reveal something significant about Britain and the Conservative party. She says these things in public, knowing there is a market for them. In Brandreth’s podcast, Badenoch says she has not experienced racial prejudice in the UK “in any meaningful form”, adding, “People didn’t treat me differently, and it’s why I’m so quick to defend the UK whenever there are accusations of racism.” That’s great for her – go Kemi. But it hardly describes the general Black experience – as we might hope someone with such a profile would do – or anything backed up by data. So she is spouting derogatory nonsense about her country of cultural origin and misleads about the country she calls home. If there is value to her public utterances, it is hard to discern what that is.These are trying times, but those of us who feel proudly able to carry multiple identities – enriched by that privilege and truth – will have to go on without Kemi. Nigerians will have to love her, accepting that love is unrequited. Black Britons will seek to know and understand her, even if she shows no obvious yen to know or understand them.And people can change: for the day will come when tickling rightwing tummies no longer works, and VIP Kemi returns to mundane Earth as Olukemi Olufunto Adegoke Badenoch. We’ll see what she says then.Nels Abbey is an author, broadcaster and the founder ofUppity: the Intellectual PlaygroundDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But until they are, adults can model the positive use of techDr Kaitlyn Regehr is the programme director of digital humanities at University College LondonMon 4 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.46 EDTShareThis summer the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, announcedhe was consideringa two-hour “screen time” cap on children’s use of social media apps – a proposal that is not just insufficient, it’s outdated.Though appropriately placed at the start of the summer holiday – a time when kids’ screen time can increase, along with the onus on parents to ensure the safety of such engagement – Kyle’s announcement is linked to somewhat stale screen time guidance. We should indeed be thinking about moderating time on screens, but the proposed cap addresses only the quantity of consumption, not the quality. Fortunately, as someone who lectures on digital literacy (and is a mother), I can tell you there are some ways to push back and create healthier habits for children this summer – even if the government doesn’t seem to have caught up with them yet.Limiting screen time has been the dominant digital guidance used by parents, educators – and all of us really – over the past decade. This advice emerged afterstudies indicatedthat increasing screen time could be a risk factor for being overweight/obesity in children and adolescents. This was, and is, good guidance to promote physical health. However, it didn’t include robust discussion about how the quality or nature of content online might be affecting mental health.For example, in following this guidance, you could have one child watching CBeebies with their family in a communal space, engaging in discussion; and another child wearing headphones and watching algorithmically driven YouTube shorts. Under “screen time” guidance, these two forms of viewing would be considered equal. But, of course, they are qualitatively very different. In this scenario, one child is engaged in interactive, collective viewing with a parent that might be a jumping-off point for discussion and connection. The other child’s viewing is isolated and fragmented; they are consuming short-form content, probably with little focus on meaningful storylines or characters, on a platform that is still, by comparison, unregulated.YouTubeis where much of our kids’ screen time is spent, and is nowthe most popular first TV destinationfor generation Alpha. A staggering88% of UK childrenaged three to 17 use the platform. And yet YouTube is often not included in discussions of social media bans, and nor was it mentioned in Kyle’s statement.There have been attempts to distinguish between types of screen time, such as “passive” and “active” engagement. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health haspushed for policyto focus on habits and behaviours. This might take into account “active screen time”, which involves cognitively or physically engaging in screen-based activities, such as playing games or completing homework on a computer, and “passive screen time”, which includes non-interactive viewing with low levels of intellectual and social engagement.Similarly, theAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatryrecommends familiarising yourself with what your child is watching and talking to them about it – and in ways that makes screen time more social, educational and creative. However, for the most part, these suggestions have not been fully embraced by the public or political zeitgeist.In encouraging more intentional choices about what and how kids are watching, I am not suggesting that heaping personal responsibility on to individuals is the answer. We are in the midst of a digital public health crisis. One that has prompted theUS surgeon general Vivek Murthy’sto suggest that social media increases the risk that children will experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. Bold policies that address the underlying technical and financial structures of these platforms are necessary. This is where Kyle should direct his attention.In the meantime, the proposals Kyle should be offering the public should not be limply drawn from outdated guidance. Proposals should be based on a deeper understanding around differing forms of usage. They should consider both physical and mental health concerns, and address systemic issues in the design of digital platforms. And crucially, they should take into account not just quantity, but also the quality of our children’s digital consumption.Until then, however, the onus of responsibility will fall primarily on individuals – in this case, on parents – to ensure their children are learning, engaged, active and safe. That sounds overwhelming. I know. If it helps, here are some of the things I’ll be doing with my kids during the summer holidays.For younger children, time off screens is generally better than on. However, when we do use screens, I encourage my own children to watch live TV on platforms such as CBeebies and CBBC, as this provides a diversity of content curated by a children’s programmer. Lots of time and advocacy has gone into producing it.Prioritise active and engaged viewing over passive viewing. This means content that encourages creativity and discussion. This supports active brain engagement, learning and communication skills. It’s often better to opt for collective over solitary viewing, which can act as a springboard for discussion and build critical thinking and social engagement skills.Begin seeding critical thinking about digital content from an early age. You can input questionable images into platforms such asSightengine, and they will tell you how likely each image is to be fake. This is a great way to start conversations about disinformation online.Speak to older children about what they want their digital diet to look like. Together, dedicate half an hour a week to training the machine learning by actively searching for positive content – content that they are passionate about or that makes them feel good. Don’t watch uninteresting, uninspiring content or content that makes them (or you) feel bad. Quickly move past it. And teach them not to like, share things or comment on things that they don’t like. Evencommenting on somethingyou don’t like counts as engagement, meaning you may get more of it.As a family, do an “uninspiring” clean. If it no longer inspires or educates you, unfollow it. This includes exes, TV personalities and brands. Do this regularly to clean up your feed and narrow in on what you do want to see.To combat targeted advertising, there are some Google alternatives you might want to look at as a family. DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus are search engines that do not track you to serve targeted ads. You could also look atStartpage, which allows you to use Google without tracking your digital footprint.Governments may not be properly regulating this technology, but as parents, there are still things we can do. We can be more intentional about our screen use – and in doing so, begin to seed the ideas of healthy, critical screen engagement from an early age.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is the programme director of digital humanities at University College London, lecturing on digital literacy and the ethical implications of social media and AI.

The question is in the ether, with theNew York Timesinterrogating the phenomenon of “heteropessimism” or even “heterofatalism” – women, specifically, viewing their heterosexuality as a misfortune and lifelong disappointment, given the flakiness and apparent commitment-phobia of the men they encounter. Women online have also been deploring the amount of “mankeeping” (shouldering the “structural burden of men’s declining social networks” asthe research teamwho coined the term put it) in their lives.But it has being posed most entertainingly by the French Instagram account @le_trema, created by Maël Coutand. Posts follow a standard format: in faux-reportage style, Coutand says: “Today we’re asking: are heterosexuals OK? (Est-ce que les hétérosexuels vont bien?)” Then there’s a horribly catchy jingle and a clip of some egregious online machismo or manosphere discourse that makes Sinitta’s So Macho look sophisticated – thinkmen thumping each other with tyres, orshaving their eyelashesto look more manly; one tests his “self-control” bytrapping his fingers in mousetraps; anothercrawls along railings to avoid stepping on a rainbow-painted staircase. Women aren’t spared: there’s amother and daughter proudly pregnant by the same guysimultaneously, and amind-bogglingly OTT gender reveal ceremony. The conclusion is inevitably: “Non!”Of course, bigger picture, heterosexuals are fine. Many of us are in happy relationships with sane members of the opposite sex. But more importantly, it’s not straights whosuffer significant physical and mental health inequalitiesandpoorer housing outcomes, who face discrimination and violence for their sexual identity or whose existence is still criminalised in disgracefully large swathes of the world.Teasingly interrogating the wilder, weirder corners of heteronormativity is a fun corrective; speaking to the radio station France Inter, Coutant said people have told him the account has been a starting point to discuss the absurd expectations around masculinity with their teenage sons. It’s also very funny and doesn’t require much French, but beware that earworm of a jingle: the next time you skirt a bare-chested punch-up outside a ’Spoons, read aboutGregg Wallace’s new “men only” chat roomor catch five minutes of Love Island, it will play, unbidden, in your head.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is anincredible achievementand one that will reverberate through the women’s game for many years to come.The head coach, Sarina Wiegman, is simply world class; it’s an overused phrase but absolutely fitting in this case. To reach five major finals in a row (including a European Championship win and a World Cup final with the Netherlands before joining England) is a record that may never be surpassed. She was an inspired choice by Kay Cossington, the former Football Association technical director who targeted her for her ability to build a strong culture and sense of team as much as her obvious tactical acumen.WSL hoping to turn Lionesses fever at Euros into huge boost for domestic gameRead moreThe Lionesses, like their manager, also demonstrate exemplary leadership qualities on and off the pitch. On the pitch, they are wonderfully resilient and determined and simply do not know how to give up.In the semi-final, as even the most ardent England fan was losing hope, they found a way in the 96th minute to claw themselves back into the competition. They had to come from behind three times in the competition and emerged victorious from two penalty shootouts (how very un‑English) to retain their trophy.Off the pitch, they are visible and vocal ambassadors for the game, demanding equal access for girls to play and ensuring that when the baton is passed on to the next generation the game is left in a better place. They utilised their platform to speak out on a range of issues from periods to autism, mental health and bereavement and also took a stand against theabhorrent racism directed at Jess Carter. The Lionesses are the powerful role models our young girls so desperately need.While the England men’s team, under Gareth Southgate’s leadership, embodied a more inclusive vision of Englishness (captured beautifully in Dear England) the Lionesses have embodied a strong powerful sense of a modern young woman. So, congratulations Sarina and the Lionesses, I couldn’t be a more proud English woman.But, with the players now on a well-deserved break, attention will soon turn to the launch of the Women’s Super League season and the need to maximise the momentum from the summer.The Lionesses captured the imagination of the nation. TV audiencespeaked at 16 million for the final, the biggest audience of the year and something that would have seemed unimaginable not so long ago.More than 65,000 fans came to London last Tuesday, in unprecedented scenes for women’s sport, to congratulate their heroines and celebrate their achievements. Even the most ardent naysayers have to admit – women’s football has a passionate and growing fanbase.And it is this very fanbase that presents football with its biggest growth opportunity. Arecent Nielsen reportestimated that women’s football fans worldwide will reach 800 million by 2030. The women’s football fanbase is young, diverse, female skewed and passionate about the women’s game, its values, its inclusiveness and its accessibility. Clubs’ marketing and PR strategies need to reflect this and understand that the way the women’s game is consumed is different from the men’s game.Targeting this fanbase in this way will bring clubs new fans through the turnstiles, new brands and new revenues. Now who couldn’t get behind that opportunity?The challenge for WSL Football (the new company overseeing women’s professional football), working tirelessly to grow the game, is the varying levels of commitment, expertise and investment from the clubs to do just this.Arsenal offer proof that investing in a great product, marketing it to this new fanbase and providing a great match day experience can create a viable women’s football team. They have already sold 15,000 season tickets and, come the opening fixture, the Emirates Stadium will be sold out with Gooners welcoming back both their Lionesses and their Champions League‑winning heroines.View image in fullscreenAlessia Russo, Leah Williamson, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Chloe Kelly and Beth Mead won the Champions League this year.Photograph: Rodrigo Antunes/ReutersBut many clubs are just scratching the surface, focused on the behemoth that is men’s football. And I do understand. If you are responsible for a global brand where the majority of revenue comes from the men’s game, this will be your main focus, but forward-thinking leaders of clubs cannot miss this new growth opportunity. A modern progressive club, attracting purpose-driven brands and engaging the next generation of young fans will need a thriving men’s and women’s team. The younger generation expect better.And if you can’t or won’t invest in it there are plenty who will. Women’s football is becoming fertile ground for investors and private equity as club audiences, revenues and valuations grow exponentially.Michele Kang’s purchase of London City LionessesandAlexis Ohanian’s 10% investment in Chelseais only the tip of the iceberg. These investors bring in much needed revenue to bolster the first team as well as a start-up mindset with the capability and focus to drive commercial growth.The worst thing that clubs can do now is nothing, whether that’s not selling a stake to attract the expertise and investment required or not investing themselves. Put bluntly, it’s time to put up or sell out.Women’s football, in my lifetime, will become the second biggest sport in the world behind men’s football. If you cannot see this after Euro 2025, then you need to take the blinkers off.It’s time to step up and invest. The Lionesses’ legacy depends on you.Kelly Simmons is a consultant for Run Communications’ women’s sport division, Run X, and former director of the women’s professional game at the Football Association.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In fact, the outer path might just be the way to reach your inner peaceMon 4 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.22 EDTShareThe ancient Aztecs aren’t usually grouped with today’s self-help gurus. But their philosophy, preserved in early post-conquest records, offers surprisingly sharp tools for modern life. Unlike stoicism or Buddhism, which emphasize internal reflection as the path to a better life, the Aztecs believed that you should start with your surroundings, your relationships, your body and speech. In their view, wisdom begins outside. Here are 10 lessons from their “outward path”, starting with those that clarify life goals.1 You aren’t really after happiness, you just think you areThe pursuit of happiness is written into the US Declaration of Independence. Aristotle wrote volumes about its role as the chief aim of our life more than 2,000 years before that. While it’s a staple notion in our culture, the Aztecs took a more realistic approach. “Happiness”, when it’s not some complicated idea that’s drifted from our ordinary meaning, is fleeting and tends to be followed by its opposite: pain or at least fatigue.That means “happiness” isn’t a suitable goal in life, though it at first looks plausible. What you truly want is something richer, and they likened it to rootedness: being firmly grounded in your body, mind, society and nature. We make sacrifices for our friends and our children, after all, and we think our lives are better for it. That’s exactly the Aztec point.2 The things that make life worth living also make it fragileA second idea, which finds some expression in stoicism and Buddhism, is that you’re after a life that is invulnerable. It’s the notion that if you’re a good person, none of the things that matter in your life can be affected by life’s unpredictable events, even by tragedies.The Aztecs wouldn’t agree. The best things in life, such as love, integrity and justice, also expose you to pain. Emiliano Zapata, the people’s revolutionary inMexicowho was fluent in Nahuatl and loyal to his people, died young because he refused to betray his values. Aztec ethics embrace this tension: that meaning arises from choices that involve risk. A well-rooted life accepts heartbreak as part of the price of significance.3 The wise don’t think for themselvesIt’s tempting to think that if you were just smart enough, you’d have all the answers. We tend to valorize the “lone wolf” individual who knows better than the crowd. But for the Aztecs, you shouldn’t need to “go it alone” if you live in a healthy community of friends and family. Ideally, good thinking is done in good groups.The Aztecs held structured group deliberations, where even the young had a voice, though experience carried weight. They would advise that you could build your own “decision circle” and vet your goals with people who challenge and support you. If you’re thinking alone, you’re probably not thinking at your best.4 Great courage comes from small thingsThe stories of Aztec heroism during the colonial period are legion. For example, it turns out that Cortés had a son, named Martín, with a Native woman. And though Martín should have been treated well, he was left bereft of political protection some time after his (in)famous father died. Local authorities captured him and forced him to endure brutal torture in an attempt to provoke a false confession. Martín never gave in.While such feats of endurance are partly grounded in a person’s innate personality, Martín may well have learned some of the ways the Aztecs instilled courage through repeated small hardships. They didn’t optimize for ease. They taught their children to sweep before dawn, to carry heavy logs, and to stay up late. But in these many small feats, they also taught them how to sing while they worked and to manage their outlook. Courage starts small and grows strong.5 Social vulnerability builds lifelong stabilityWe live in a world under the constant gaze of others. Yet, if you want to live your life, and not the life “they” tell you to lead, you will have to learn to ignore “them”. Similarly, if you want to live well, to preserve the value of your own self-worth, then you need to learn what is of real value. One father is documented as he proudly recounts doing humble, hard work to raise his son, never stealing even a grain.You can build this skill through strategic vulnerability. Try doing something mildly embarrassing. Speak the truth when it’s awkward. Let your social mask slip. That’s how you can try to gain some distance from “their” gaze.6 Willpower isn’t one thing, it’s threeA paradox I noticed in graduate school was that I had no problem putting in hours of tedious study, but I would cave on my dieting goals if someone put a cookie in front of me. The Aztecs took an approach that solves this paradox. Willpower comes in three forms:Drive (high-intensity action),Durability (consistent effort), andDiscipline (resistance to temptation).You need different tools for different challenges. Running into a flooded basement is not the same as resisting late-night cake. You need to train all three.7 When on the path, it’s easier to stay on the pathConsistent action begets more consistent action. Aztec students swept daily before sunrise and kept their rooms clean. Today, it might be spending 15 minutes each day on a foreign language or making your bed. Whatever it is, hook your new effort to an existing habit to build yet more consistent actions.8 You need to practice cravings to stop themThe Aztecs fasted not to shame their bodies but to train them. Fasting was paired with feasting and used to practice discipline, the kind of willpower that opposes temptation. The goal was a higher-level awareness of your reactions. For example, you might notice that hunger comes in waves, rather than building infinitely. Craving, like emotion, can be ridden out if you know what to expect and why you endure.9 What crosses your lips pre-frames your mindThe Aztecs emphasized “right speech” as a way of aligning outer habits with inner values. Words, once spoken, nudge your mind into specific frames of thought. So they trained children to speak deliberately, truthfully, humbly, and to avoid gossip. Modern psychologists like Robert Cialdini have come to similar conclusions. What you say out loud subtly rewires how you think. So be careful: your words communicate thoughts and calibrate your expectations.10 Why the wise follow the outward pathThe Aztecs believed wisdom starts not with introspection but with habit, ritual and environment. Clean your space. Speak with care. Eat with intention. Build habits that train your body and attune your mind. As you do, your inner world comes into alignment.You don’t need to solve your soul before setting your house in order. In fact, the outer path might just be the way to reach your inner peace.Sebastian Purcell is an associate professor of philosophy at Suny-Cortland in New York, where he researches ethics, Aztec philosophy and mathematical logic.

Ministers performatively “rage” about polluting water companies. Regulators arerejigged. Laws are passed. Yetlittle actually changes. The latest manoeuvre by Yorkshire Water is a case in point – and a revealing one.In March, the companywas ordered to pay £40mfor the “unacceptable impact” of sewage spills blamed on poor maintenance. It was one of six firms caught by Labour’s new bonus ban for the most serious polluters, passed under the Water (Special Measures) Act earlier this year. But the company confirmed to the Guardian that its chief executive,Nicola Shaw, received an additional £660,000 for “investor-related” work last year – on top of her £689,000 take home pay.The money did not come from Yorkshire Water directly, but from Kelda Holdings, the firm’s offshore parent. Usingcomplex corporate structuresto sidestep regulatory scrutiny is not a new trick. Many water companies are structured to allowfinancial engineeringto take place at one remove from the regulated business. But Yorkshire’s executive reward scheme reveals something important about the nature of the bonus ban itself: its design left scope for avoidance. If companies can reclassify pay or shift it between entities, enforcement becomes a matter of interpretation.Ministers say they are “aware” of the payments and Ofwat is “assessing” them. But this is a now-familiar Whitehall formulation – passive, conditional and hollow. The environment secretary, Steve Reed, appears to have a habit of making threats he doesn’t back up. When Southern Water, also under the bonus ban,nearly doubled the pay packageawarded to its CEO to £1.4m, Mr Reed’s response was to urge him toturn it down. No ministerial direction to investigate. No legal challenge or legislative amendment. Just a suggestion.Why the timidity? Because Labour’s tough talk on water is just words. It won’t touch the system that enables this behaviour, and ministers bend over backwards to reassure markets they never will. The Treasury wants Thames Water kept private – warning Mr Reed a £4bn rescue through nationalisation wouldgut his entire budget. No wonder he keepsshroud-wavingabout the cost of public ownershipThe government seems dazzled by private providers. Regulators are being asked to offer “forbearance”, as Mr Reed’s Independent Water Commission suggested. No doubt they had in mind Thames Water, which is facing anestimated £1bnin Ofwat performance penalties. The logic seems to be that enforcement risks spooking the investors needed to fund long-overdue infrastructure upgrades.But this reveals the real problem. England’s water system has beenfinancialisedto the point of dysfunction. Layered holding companies, offshore entities and opaque capital structures mean regulators are chasing shadows. Attempts to govern via gesture – bonus bans, naming and shaming – are no substitute for structural reform.Most countries retain public ownership, recognising water as a public good, not a commodity. The idea that better people could fix the system is a fantasy – decades of extraction, debt-loading and dividend grabs show the model itself is broken. If Labour truly wants to clean up the nation’s waterways, it must confront a hard truth: the incentives of private capital and the obligations of public interest, health and accountability do not align. Until then, expect more sewage, more euphemisms and more payments that defy the spirit – if not always the letter – of the law.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

During the 1970s and 80s, Bowie was not alone. The divided, fascinating city was famously a magnet for young people drawn by a music and club scene unique in Europe.Sadly, living on the edge has these days taken on a different meaning for Berlin clubs struggling to survive in altered times. In a sobering dispatch at the weekend, the Guardian reported that one of Germany’s oldest and most important gay dance clubs has justdeclared itself bankrupt. Founded in 1977 – the year Bowie brought out his classic Low album – SchwuZ became a pioneering presence in the development of Berlin’s LGBTQ+ networks, and a symbol of the freedoms available in a city with a thriving counterculture. It will stay open until October and has launched a fundraising drive, but the prospects look bleak.More broadly,Clubsterben(the death of clubs) is becoming an unhappy fact of Berliner life. Industry organisations warn that a combination of factors isundermining a proud cultural inheritance. Some clubs have failed to recover from the impact of the pandemic. Inflation and higher electricity costs have further ratcheted up the pressure.Soaring commercial rents and gentrification – in a city once described by its mayor as“poor but sexy”– are cumulatively taking their toll. Busche, another famous gay and lesbian club with its roots in communist East Berlin, closed last month, citing rising costs.Wilde Renate, part of a more recent wave of 21st-century household names, will close at the end of the year, after unsustainable rent rises in the down-at-heel Friedrichshain district.Changing habits among the young may also be playing a part. One recent survey of Berlin club owners found that the estimatedaverage age of clubbers was 30, with less buy-in from those aged 18 to 21. Generation Z loves an outdoor festival, but its relish for hedonistic excess in smallish independent venues may not be as pronounced as in previous generations. Cost-of-living related issues have undoubtedly contributed to a fall in overall club attendance numbers.In October, a celebratory festival willmake the casefor the “long-term visibility and recognition” of the city’s clubs. A fightback on their behalf is surely overdue. Last year the federal governmentadded Berlin’s techno sceneto a list of Germany’s “intangible cultural heritage”, compiled for Unesco. But the dangers faced by a sector that risks tipping into sad decline are all too tangible. Regulating commercial rents for locations deemed to be of cultural importance would be one significant way to offer a lifeline.From the Cabaret-style glitz of the Weimar era to 1990s techno startupsbased in urban wasteland, Berlin nightlife has always known how to adapt to the times. But a history so precious should not be abandoned to the whims of market forces. In recent years, many Berliners have mourned the demise of thousands of traditional corner pubs, or Kneipen, as rents have gone up and leases have not been renewed. The city’s remarkable, historic club scene deserves to be treated with more care and respect.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why does recognition depend on Israel’s actions? Surely it should depend on Palestine’s: commitments to abjure terrorism, disarm Hamas, hold democratic elections and, of course, to release the hostages.As forIsrael, UK policy should be to impose draconian sanctions: if Israel continues to act like a pariah state, let it be treated as one. Without sanctions, there would probably still be an apartheid regime in South Africa. The UK must act now, not half-heartedly in September; thousands of children in Gaza can’t wait until then.Doug MaughanDunblane, PerthshireLike so many people in the UK, I thought that my despair and shame over the situation in Gaza could not be deepened.Keir Starmerachieved that. How like this prime minister to obfuscate further and kick any sense of decisiveness into the long grass of contingency.One might think that Britain has some special responsibility for recognising the state of Palestine, whose population it abandoned to the predations of its neighbour in 1948. What will be left ofGaza, the West Bank and its people by September? A genocide? A diaspora? The UK doesn’t negotiate with terrorists, just with war criminals.EmeritusProf Graham MortLancaster UniversitySoon after the atrocities of 7 October 2023 I heard someone on the radio say, with respect to Israel’s imminent invasion of Gaza, “Beware of being goaded by your enemy into doing what your enemy wants you to do.” Nearly two years on, the Israeli government seems hell-bent on creating a moral equivalence between itself and Hamas.If you become like your enemy, then your enemy has won. Thus, despite what it says about recent moves to recognise a Palestinian state, the Israeli government, more than any other, is “rewarding” Hamas for its terrorist actions.The RevRob KelseyBerwick-upon-Tweed, NorthumberlandIt is impossible for us to know the depth of despair Palestinians must feel to hear western nations pontificating that we will not recognise them as a nation if their oppressors stop killing them. It seems this is the ultimate acknowledgment that they have no rights except those we deem to give them. We have expelled them from the land in which they lived to ensure that Europe didn’t have the problem of resettling the thousands displaced by a European war.They are being attacked in Gaza and the West Bank with weapons supplied by western governments. They are being starved in Gaza to keep their oppressor-in-chief in office. And now our governments are praised for condescending to recognise the fact that they are a nation (that has existed for more than 1,000 years). How can we think we have any integrity left in our dealings with the oppressed?Michael McLoughlinWallington,LondonWhat will give greater weight to the call for a two-state solution is outlining the building blocks for establishment of a Palestinian state: for example, Gaza would be placed under UN control to allow for demilitarisation, the physical reconstruction and drawing up a basic law to guide the development of a constitutional state.Gavin WeirCape Town, South AfricaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He elicits cliches of golf courses and cruises enjoyed by older people who are not working. The reality for many, however, is very different.The average age oflabour market exitis rising, reaching a new high last year of 65.7 for men and 64.5 for women. However, we know that many people struggle to remain in work in the years before they reach the state pension age.Poor health and providing care for loved ones are two key reasons. The current labour market offers inadequate support and flexibility for these challenges, and people receive little in the way of retraining or help to use transferable skills. All of this reduces the potential for people to work. This leaves many facing real hardship in retirement, years before they can draw a pension.The wealthy baby boomer stereotype masks a problem – there is significant and increasing inequality in pensioner incomes. We must abandon ageist stereotypes and talk about this group in a more nuanced way if we are to make the right calls on pensions policy – for all our sakes.Fair access to work in later life is already an urgent imperative, and will only become more so if the state pension age is to continue rising.Dr Carole EastonChief executive, Centre for Ageing BetterWhat an insulting and stereotyped picture Phillip Inman paints of early retirees. I earned my choice to retire at 55 by working for almost 40 years and paying into a pension from my early 20s. I’ve never played golf and the idea of a cruise is anathema to me. I’m not working my way through a bucket list and I haven’t left England since I retired. But I do volunteer, putting back into my community along with thousands of other retirees who donate thousands of hours of their time each year. Where would charity shops, community centres, Citizens Advice bureaux be without early retirees? Who would look after all those grandchildren whose parents can’t afford childcare? Mr Inman should widen his outlook rather than write off a whole section of the community with his sweeping comments.Jenny ChittendenMaldon, EssexHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Gould revised and expanded his book in 1996 in part to refute the arguments supporting race-based theories of human intelligence put forward in The Bell Curve, the 1994 bestseller that is mentioned in one of your articles.Gould focused on the work of one Edinburgh alumnus, Samuel George Morton, a Philadelphia physician and natural scientist who had amassed more than 1,000 human skulls, which became the source of “data” for his scientific racism as promoted in American institutions of higher education at the time.Prof Catherine HennessyCrieff, Perth and KinrossThe University of Edinburgh’s embracing racist theories and practices was not, of course, an unusual occurrence. When I joined the geography department of Newcastle University in 1968, the departmental library had a long shelf of bound annual volumes of Eugenics Review. Libraries take journals to support the research of staff who subsequently list articles from the journals on reading lists for students. I know of no one, staff or student, using this academic resource in 1968. My point is that a very simple way to explore the embrace of race theories in British universities is to investigate past subscriptions to journals such as Eugenics Review.Peter TaylorTynemouth, Tyne and WearThe novel that remains really worth reading for a deeply emotive and human understanding of the mechanics and processes of the slave trade is Barry Unsworth’sSacred Hunger, which deserves to be seen in the same small league as Moby-Dick. Though its British hub is Liverpool, it includes Scottish deckhands among its characters, as well as a meeting near the African coast between the slave ship at its centre with a rival slaver captained by a Scotsman, Macdonald. Accounts of ideological superstructure, such as those encouraged by Edinburgh University, provide a surface veneer of the true horror that only great fiction truly plumbs, and in this respect the Unsworth novel is incomparable.Rukun AdvaniRanikhet, IndiaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Have you ever seen the one‑armed man running a bye to the keeper while20,000 people leap and writhe and hold their headsand the one-armed man shouts in agony?Have you ever seen figures picked out in silhouette at the top of the stand, posed in perfect shapes of triumph, dread and fear because another gobbet of time has passed, another dot, because essentially nothing has happened?England and injured Woakes denied as India win fifth Test thriller to draw seriesRead moreHave you ever seen the one‑armed man walk down and prod the middle of the wicket between balls, like this is just another cricket day, and had to swallow a snort of disbelief at the extreme cinematic weirdness of this snapshot in time?At times such as these, immersed in the super-heated bubble at the final day at the Oval, all of this stuff undeniably happening but also basically nothing, a story told only to itself, you do wonder how you’d explain it to someone from Denmark.Words such as nuance, post-colonial, will, protocol gabbled out while the person from Denmark nods politely. Wait. Geopolitics! Hunger! Umpire’s call! And all of this expressed through 25 days of the most stiffly choreographed sporting activity ever devised. This is a game that takes place in trousers. It’s a dance around a semi‑invisible dark red ball.Two hours after the final notes at the Oval all that was left on one of the upper staircases in the stand at the Vauxhall End was a single abandoned black leather slip‑on shoe with an empty carton of snus balanced on top of it, and you thought, yeah, that seems about right. At the end of which India did definitely win here by six runs.On a grey and smudged south London morning, the Oval felt like a mini-Glastonbury before play. All the notes were here, the hum, the crackle, the shouts, the Indian section in the stands rising to wave at Dinesh Karthik as he marched across this sallow old lime green oval like a presidential candidate.This is a very distinct stage for urban sporting theatre. Crawl past on a 36 bus and you get to peer in over that high wall into an empty secret garden, peopled for six months of the year by a man with a broom, but tended and cherished for moments such as this when it feels like nowhere else in the world could possibly exist; and where suddenly something comes up out of the soil, echoes of other days, stored up energy, ghosts at the edge of the action.View image in fullscreenIndia’s Mohammed Siraj (right) and Dhruv Jurel celebrate victory in the fifth Test against England.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe first of those, that first Ashes Test in 1881, was so tense it is said one spectator died of a heart attack, while another chewed through an umbrella handle as Fred “the Demon” Spofforth worked his way through England’s batsmen.What was the modern equivalent here? Breaking your refresh button? Spontaneously combusting your own vape?Cricket, which is always dying even while it throbs with vibrant life, is always doing this to us, and always questioning itself, wondering about the end times even while it’s out there writing Ulysses again.Here England needed 35 to win and India three and a half wickets to level the series. The players came out to a huge rolling wave of applause, India’s fielders breaking from their huddle to sprint in unison, impossibly heroic already, a group who have given us everything over the past two months.And this was a day for Mohammed “the Demon” Siraj, who really is the most lovable maniac in sport, and who bowled like a god here to win this game.Jamie Overton hooked the first ball for four and Surrey-cut the next one and you waited for the energy to shift. Prasidh Krishna just laughed and you loved him for it. Jamie Smith still looked stuck, frozen, drained and was duly euthanised from the crease. England tried to Baz this, to play shots, because how else? But the ball was talking too, and the ball will have its say.Overton lasted one delivery from Siraj, who was bowling to his own stirring one-man montage soundtrack by now. Simple pieces of Test cricket, a leave, were greeted with huge cheers and gasps like Puccini being roared on by a heavy metal stadium.Josh Tongue came and went like filler in a western who exists only to be gunned down in the final shootout. And so it came to pass, as Chris Woakes walked down the pavilion steps for his Lord Nelson moment. Kiss me, Gus.This should not be happening. A one-armed man, sling tucked weirdly inside his woollen jumper, is trying to play elite sport. Gus Atkinson slogged a swirling six over long-on, like a man throwing the last sticks of furniture on to the fire. There was wild impromptu chatter about the tactics, the game‑state of how to rotate the one-armed man, how to farm him, all of it just noise in the dark.Siraj was always going to close this out. Atkinson’s off-stump was flattened and the moment seemed to stretch out. There was a breath, a beat, before the chaos of victory kicked in, figures running everywhere, an unceasing well of drama, needle, blood, skill leading to the perfect symmetry of a 2-2 draw. And all the while underneath the static and the shouts something else seemed to settle, the sound of quiet applause.Never mind the score, or the arguments over moments, luck, injury, whatever. It is simply time for hats off here. Plaudits to India for a wonderful effort. And from a home point of view, for Ben Stokes and the Bazball project.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are you not wrung out, frazzled, wowed? It has been the most glorious experiment, moments of beauty, fun and impossible drama set always to its own insistent set of rhythms.And who knows, we may not see this again. This may be the thing, right here. Who knows if Stokes will play another Test in England? The plan is to keep rolling on, but Australia tends to be a bookend and England’s captain has been playing at this level for 14 years.View image in fullscreenMohammed Siraj bowls Gus Atkinson for the final wicket to give India victory by six runs.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianWoakes may be done. Joe Root, surely not. Mark Wood, not sure. Jofra Archer, not sure. But what a show they have given us. What are they going to say about Bazball? Who’s going to tell them? What sense will this make when cricket has become the Ryder Cup or some colours on a screen with a shouting man from Love Island?Even the ceremonials at the end were part of the theatre, like the final act of a Shakespeare comedy when all returns to laughter, bonds are formed, hands shaken, misunderstandings corrected. Stokes was pale and terse, deep in the Oval indoor school, but he talked first about the spectacle and the brilliance of the series.England do like to chat about being the saviours of Tests. There is self-interest in this. It’s a very well‑paid job. But it is also love, devotion and faith. “As a massive advocate of this format … this has certainly been one of those series that can keep that narrative around Test cricket is dying … so … well,” Stokes shrugged, while also sniffing at the idea that Harry Brook had let his team down byscoring the wrong kind of 111.Stokes made a good point about the selflessness of the remaining England seamers, putting their bodies on the line to fill the breach left by Woakes. He talked about Siraj with genuine admiration, which will, you feel, mean a lot to the man himself. He said he would now be “knocking about” the Hundred, which is a bit like Odin announcing at the end of the Asgard‑Jotunheim War that he fancies a game of Bop-It now.And so we must talk about the past and future, both of which do still have to exist outside the moment. Bazball can be maddening, cult-like, just another clique. England have talked mind‑bending rubbish at times. There have been shoulders picks, good-around-the-group picks. Any divvying up of this result should dwell on the selection of two players who just haven’t had any cricket, most obviously Jacob Bethell, who was shunted into the light and produced a tortured innings, a man out there batting with a stale baguette.View image in fullscreenAkash Deep, Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna of India celebrate after winning the fifth Test.Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty ImagesThe Baz-era has been maddening to every person from every other country who has ever heard a self-assured Englishman explaining the world to them while simultaneously conveying that, yeah, you’re doing really well, but we do still own this. The super cool optics, the iconography of lounging exceptionalism. It has been very funny at times.But this thing has also produced utterly thrilling cricket, sport that is simply unlike the stuff that went before. It has been postmodernism at times, taking these structures and relics and trying to do something new. What is batting? What is a game for? What is a nightwatchman? Test cricket is always an interplay of rules, shapes, tradition and the slightly tortured individuals at its centre. This has been pure personality, those old rules and protocols bent into a framework for self‑expression.It also gave us this final day, because England kept playing the same way to the end rather than falling into respectable defeat, a strange blend of colour, will, drama, art, maths, salt, sweet, sour, bitter, umami; and a reminder that this sport will always leave you both stuffed to the gills and deliciously unsatisfied.At close of play it no longer felt like a chilly November morning. It felt like February. It isn’t overly dramatic to say this might yet be the high point of all this. We will now need to talk about team building and the future. England do look well set for the Ashes, if the bowling can settle down and bodies heal. For now it is probably best just to be glad we got to see it.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Calm, assured, skilful and accurate from the tee. Chapeau.Try of seriesTom Wright, second Test, Melbourne. What a ripper! Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii’s midfield break split the Lions wide open and Wright’s touchdown put his side 23-5 up.Biggest villainHas to be Australia’s now-convicted “mushroom murderer” Erin Patterson. Her shocking court case pushed the Lions way down the news agenda.Unsung heroJac Morgan. The brave back-rower never started a Test but Wales’s solitary representative did himself – and his country – proud.Favourite momentEverything aboutthe second Testwas brilliant. The stroll down to the iconic MCG, the pre-match vibe – excellent use of AC/DC’s Hells Bells as intro music – followed by a belting game in front of 90,000 fans. This year’s cricket Ashes will be fun.Worst momentIdly looking around for my laptop bag only to realise – agh! – I’d left it in a Sydney taxi which was now 25km away. Fortunately, there was a happy ending.This Lions tour was… A reminder that sport is nothing without an audience. The previous Lions tour in South Africa took place behind closed doors; this one was enhanced by up to 40,000 visiting supporters, many of whom have been saving up to make the trip for years. All hail the sea of red.Next stop for Lions should be… To sit down and reimagine what future Lions tours should look like. Australia in 2037 including games in Japan and Fiji? France? South America? Or maybe an oval-ball Ryder Cup equivalent: Europe v the Rest of the World? Before somebody else launches it instead.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s giant second row Will Skelton (centre) impressed, in spite of being on the losing side.Photograph: David Davies/PAGerard MeagherMan of seriesWill Skelton, Australia. The cumulative scoreboard reflects that with the 23st second row on the field, the Wallabies comfortably outscored the Lions. The overarching feeling atfull-time in Sydneywas just what might have happened had he been fit in Brisbane.Try of seriesTomos Williams for Lions v Western Force. Williams’s second try of the match was a peach. Mack Hansen made the initial break, offloading inside to James Lowe, who found Williams dashing down the wing. The scrum-half exchanged passes with Lowe again before diving in the corner. Such a shame he injured his hamstring in doing so.Biggest villainNot one individual but the TMO – a role occupied by various officials throughout – did not have a great tour. In Sydney on Saturday, Dan Sheehan’s blatant illegal clearout on Tom Lynagh went unpunished before a second-half check for the most innocuous of occurrences.Unsung heroCharlie Gamble, Waratahs and First Nations & Pasifika XV. Maybe not unsung given he was named player of the matchfor the FNP sideand was praised for his performance for the Waratahs, but the beauty of tours such as this is watching players such as Gamble rewarded with an unlikely appearance in the series. Alas it didn’t happen.Favourite momentOwen Farrell giving his boots to a child who had run on to the pitch in Sydney, only to be led away by security. These are the sorts of gestures made by Farrell that tend to go unnoticed by those who love to slate the only member of this squad with two series wins to his name.Worst momentSweet Caroline, or something similarly obnoxious, blaring out while players are receiving treatment for worrying looking injuries. It has happened far too often, most recently when James Ryan was knocked cold for a couple of minutes in Sydney. Tone deaf.This Lions tour was… A slow burner and suddenly over too quickly, leaving a lingering sense of frustration that the Wallabies started the Test series so tamely. It did reach a stunning peak at the MCG and it should also be said it is always a stunning country to travel.Next stop for Lions should be… The couch or beach. It is August, the new football season is almost upon us and most of these players – some clearly running on fumes in Sydney – have been going non-step since last September. There are mandated rest periods at the start of next season and the hope is that they are stuck to.Jack SnapeMan of seriesWill Skelton. The return of the Wallabies’ lock flipped the series’ momentum and he starred again in the third Test.Try of seriesTom Wright, second Test. Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii lacerated the Lions’ midfield with his left foot and when Wright crossed, for a moment, Australia believed.Biggest villainDan Sheehan. Tom Curry tackling a mid-air Tom Lynagh was egregious but Dan Sheehan’s elbow to Lynagh’s head was downright ugly.Unsung heroEllis Genge. The prop was unlucky to be benched after a dominant first Test but helped to turn the second match in Melbourne to secure the series.View image in fullscreenEllis Genge fends off Australia’s Langi Gleeson during the second Test match in Melbourne.Photograph: James Ross/AAPFavourite momentThe sheer drama of the final minute of the second Test, in front of 90,000, won’t quickly be forgotten. The controversy made the Wallabies relevant to Australians again.Worst momentThe Wallabies were flying at the MCG but Tom Lynagh’s fumble and Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii’s infringement both led to tries that handed the Lions the impetus and ultimately the series.This Lions tour was …A reset for Wallabies fans, who can now look to the home 2027 World Cup with optimism.

Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Premier League/Getty Images for Premier LeagueHaving lost key players at the back, it appears Bournemouth’s buy-low sell-high model will be tested if they are to again challenge for a European placeByBen FisherMon 4 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 19.33 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:10th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:9thBournemouth kitsProspectsThree months ago,Bournemouthwon at Arsenal for the first time to maintain their hopes of qualifying for Europe with three games to go. It was an impressive comeback victory built on set pieces, Dean Huijsen heading the equaliser from Antoine Semenyo’s long throw – cue the Chill Guy meme celebration – before Evanilson poked in a scruffy but well-worked winner from a corner.Bournemouth came up short in their quest to play in Europe as a positive season fizzled out after three wins from their final 15 matches. And now three of their back five from that day have departed –Huijsen for Real Madrid, Milos Kerkez for Liverpool and Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was on loan from Chelsea, for Arsenal. The expectation is that Illia Zabarnyi will become the next high-profile exit, with Paris Saint-Germain pushing to sign the 22-year-old.The fact Bournemouth sold Huijsen to Real in a £50m deal after a single season and 36 appearances serves as a reminder of the club’s journey across the last decade, and their continued eye for smart business. The thing worth remembering is that while it appears Bournemouth have been decimated, those on the inside recognise this is how their buy-low, sell-high model works. The downside is the breakup of a brilliant, buccaneering defence.Whether Bournemouth can cope with a flurry of key departures remains to be seen but this summer they moved to find a permanent goalkeeping solution in Djordje Petrovic, a £25m signing from Chelsea. Finding a commanding No 1 capable of holding down the position had been a priority after acknowledging the stability rival clubs had gained from making similar moves. Petrovic, who shone on loan at Strasbourg last season, would appear a solid platform on which to build. But for a team that operated with a thin squad last season, it is impossible to shake the sense that starting over represents a daunting task.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerAndoni Iraola led Bournemouth to 56 points last season, their record tally in the top flight, as they finished ninth, equalling their best finish. His appointment two years ago, driven by the now Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes, has proved a masterstroke and last term enhanced the reputation of Iraola, the definition of a hands-on coach, among rivals. The 43-year-old is into the final 12 months of his contract and while he prefers working on rolling contracts, another extension is up in the air. Iraola, who does a good line in self-deprecation, is a self-confessed fidget: he clicks a multi-colour pen throughout interviews and tapes over some of his fingers for superstitious reasons. “It’s stupid,” he said. “But I have done it for so many years that I continue doing it.”Off-field pictureBournemouth’s 80-year-old billionaire owner, Bill Foley, flew from the US in April to formally open the club’s £35m state-of-the-art training complex and on the same visit he shared another welcome nugget: he has agreed a deal to buy their Vitality Stadium home, allowing Bournemouth to expand its capacity to about 20,000. The Cherries have been locked into an onerous lease with the property company Structadene, which bought the ground in 2005, then known as Dean Court, for £3.5m, a deal that helped the club avoid administration. Foley – via his Black Knight consortium – added the Portuguese club Moreirense to his stable, which includes investments in Lorient, Hibernian and Auckland FC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Adrien Truffert has the tools to be a breakout star in the Premier League. Bournemouth sealed the signing of the 23-year-old Belgium-born left-back for an initial £11.4m from Rennes, a fee the Cherries – and some of their top-flight rivals who have tracked the full-back – regard a snip given his profile. Truffert, capped once by France in 2022, was captain of Rennes and made his 150th Ligue 1 appearance in May. Perhaps it is a quirk of fate that as a toddler he lived in Bournemouth for a year with his family.View image in fullscreenAdrien Truffert of Bournemouth tussles with West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen during the Premier League Summer Series.Photograph: Todd Kirkland/Premier League/Getty ImagesStepping upDaniel Adu-Adjei spent the first half of last season on loan at the bottom of League Two, scoring two goals in 17 appearances for relegated Carlisle, so it would be quite the jump if he is involved. The 20-year-old striker, born in Hammersmith to Ghanaian parents, has impressed in pre-season, scoring against Everton, and trained regularly with the first team at the beginning of this year. His father, William, regards Tony Yeboah as one of his closest friends, while Daniel is studying a nutrition course funded by the Professional Footballers’ Association, his go-to dish a BBQ pulled chicken burger. “At Carlisle, I lived by myself and had to cook all my dinners so I learned a lot,” he said.A big season for …Few players had as satisfying a summer as Alex Scott. Even an awkward face mask, the result of a fractured jaw sustained against Aston Villa in May, could not dampen his spirits. Scott starred for England as Lee Carsley’s under-21s won the European Championship in Slovakia, starting all five matches, though he was forced off through injury in the final. Bournemouth paid Bristol City £25m to sign Scott two years ago but his progress has been stop-start and he began only eight matches last season, largely owing to a lengthy knee injury. Scott, 22 this month, is a throwback midfielder, a cute passer with an endearing appetite to get his hands dirty. Everybody is craving to see more of his talent.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26BournemouthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rio Ngumoha further enhanced his first‑team claims with a sparkling display against Athletic Bilbao that underlined the formidable strength, and options, available to Arne Slot.Ngumoha opened the scoring superbly and teed up a goal for Darwin Núñez inside five minutes at Anfield in the first of two pre-season friendlies against the Basque club.Liverpool’s ‘take it or leave it’ £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by NewcastleRead moreA packed Anfield crowd had to wait for the second fixture to catch a first glimpse of new signings Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Ekitiké and Jeremie Frimpong. Ngumoha kept them entertained before then as Liverpool recorded a comfortable 4-1 win in match one. The second game also went Liverpool’s way, a 3-2 victory in which Wirtz, Ekitiké and Frimpong added to the flowing, blistering quality of the champions’ attacking play.Ngumoha is not eligible to sign a professional contract until he turns 17 on the 29th of this month but showed why Chelsea were livid when Liverpool tempted him away from their academy last summer. In only the second minute of his second senior appearance at Anfield the teenager, who made his full debut against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup last season, set off from halfway and, with Athletic defenders all in retreat, curled an excellent finish into the bottom corner of the Kop goal from 20 yards.The left winger produced something similar in Liverpool’s previous pre‑season outing against Yokohama F Marinos last week. That goal came on the dayLuis Díaz completed his £65.5m transfer to Bayern Munich, creating an opening on the left that could be filled by any one of Cody Gakpo, Wirtz, Ekitiké and perhaps the 16-year-old talent from London. His display was enough to prompt chants of “Rio” from the Kop and a song in his honour from the singer who appeared during the interval.Ngumoha’s emergence – predicted with confidence by John Terry when he lamented the youngster’s exit from Chelsea – is timely for Liverpool as they await Newcastle’s next move on Alexander Isak. There may not be a rush to replace Díaz directly given the options already at Slot’s disposal. The Premier League champions can afford to wait on their prime target for the No 9 role and leave their £110m offer for Isak on Newcastle’s table.View image in fullscreenA Liverpool fan holds up a scarf in tribute for Diogo Jota.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThree minutes after his individual goal Ngumoha headed down a Ben Doak cross for Núñez to convert from close range. Anyone looking for clues as to Núñez’s next step – with Al-Hilal interested in taking him to the Saudi Pro League – will have noted the hand-on-the-heart celebration that followed from the £60m-rated Uruguay international in front of the Kop. A glimpse of Liverpool’s past and future, perhaps. Doak and Harvey Elliott, two other players who could leave Anfield in this window, were also on the scoresheet in the first contest against Ernesto Valverde’s side. Ngumoha’s footwork and pace also impressed in the 67 minutes he was on the pitch. He received a well-earned rousing reception when replaced by Trent Koné-Doherty.The opening game started at 5pm as scheduled despite supporters in the Main Stand having to be evacuated just over an hour before kick-off due to a false alarm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were moving moments 20 minutes into both games when everyone inside the stadium rose to their feet to applaud Liverpool’s No 20. Play stopped and players from both teams also joined in the applause for Jota and Silva.Slot was without Virgil van Dijk for both Bilbao games due to illness. The Liverpool head coach indicated the club captain could be a doubt for Sunday’s Community Shield against Crystal Palace. Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez were also absent through injury, forcing Slot to deploy 18-year-old midfielder Trey Nyoni in central defence for the first Bilbao contest and Luca Stephenson at right-back.Goalkeeper Alisson was unavailable having left Liverpool’s recent pre‑season tour of Asia due to personal reasons. Summer signings Freddie Woodman and Armin Pecsi filled in, playing one half each, while Georgia international Mamardashvili made his Anfield bow in the second game behind a central defence of Ibrahima Konaté and Wataru Endo. That is one department where the champions appear light at present. Ngumoha could add to their riches up front.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has not only been quick in the best car on the grid, but consistent and calm. This has not been the stuff of fireworks, but relentless precision. His execution and attitude have no little of the Alain Prost about them and he is shaping up to be a similarly formidable opponent as The Professor.He has gone toe to toe with his teammate, Lando Norris, in these opening 14 meetings and, overall, come out on top. There have been six wins and only twice has he failed to reach the podium. The three consummate victories in a row inBahrain,Saudi ArabiaandMiamimade his title ambitions clear, while errors have been few and far between. A spin in the wet in Australia and a safety car infringement at Silverstone are the only blots on an otherwise immaculate copybook.Next bestLando NorrisEntered the season as favourite and when the McLaren duly proved to be the class of the field was expected to exploit it. However, aftera strong start in Australiait became clear the MCL39 was not quite giving him the feel for the front grip of the car that he likes. It proved costly, particularly in qualifying, and Norris was typically forthright and honest that it was up to him to adapt.Errors compounded his problems, not least crashing in qualifying in Saudi Arabia and hitting his teammate in Canada. In Budapest, he revealed an intriguingly nihilist approach, noting in regards to the title race: “In 200 years no one is going to care. We’ll all be dead.”Rather than settling down to contemplate the meaninglessness of existence in a darkened room the Briton has doggedly stuck at his task and returned some impressive wins with fine drives inMonacoandAustriaand aninspired strategy coup on Sunday in Budapest. If he can eliminate the faults Norris will be challenging his teammate to the end.Room for improvementMax VerstappenBefore the weekend began in Hungary,Verstappen ended speculation over his futureby stating he would be with Red Bull next year, but did not say whether he would see out his contract that runs to 2028.The world champion has acknowledged the title is beyond him this year, but he still craves performance and stability within the team. However, over these 14 races, the form of the car has been sorely lacking, while bringing an end to the turbulence of the past two years and soothing the ruffled brows of the Verstappen camp was at least part of the purpose of theremoval of Red Bull’s team principal of 20 years, Christian Horner.View image in fullscreenVictory at Suzuka in the Japanese Grand Prix was a rare high point in an otherwise disappointing first half of the season for Max Verstappen.Photograph: Issei Kato/ReutersVerstappen has still succeeded in wrestling repeated results, including two impressive wins, from a car that is barely manageable, but he and the team’s focus is now on the future. There are major exams coming up in the form of the new regulations for next season and, for the second half of this one, the question that will dominate is how doRed Bullunder their new boss, Laurent Mekies, now adapt? If the Frenchman fails to deliver, the internal politicking at the team could be fascinating. And brutal.Best newcomerGabriel BortoletoWhen Sauber brought in a new floor in Spain the 20-year-old Brazilian rookie came alive, showing promise given his team’s relatively uncompetitive car. He is in good company in the new intake.At Racing Bulls, Isack Hadjar has been a standout adapting quickly to F1 with consistent, confident performances and largely outdriving his teammate, Liam Lawson, whom Red Bull had rated enough to promote, briefly, to the senior squad at the start of the season. Kimi Antonelli has demonstrated his potential at Mercedes, but has been inconsistent in a car George Russell muscledto a win in Canada.Bortoleto has given the impression he may have so much more to come. After Sauber applied upgrades in Barcelona, Bortoleto took his first points in Austria including challenging Fernando Alonso for seventh place. A crash at Silverstone followed while on slicks in the wet, but he took points in Belgium and in Hungary he was flying. He qualified seventh, 12 places in front of his experienced teammate, Nico Hülkenberg, and claimed sixth in the race after a battling drive. If he can repeat it in the second half of the season, Audi, as Sauber will be next season, have a genuine asset.Earned a holidayLewis HamiltonLeft dejected after two races of, by his own admission, below-par performances – with 16th on the grid in Spa and a 12th in qualifying in Hungary he describedas “absolutely useless”before finishing the race in 12th – Lewis Hamilton even appeared to cast doubt on his future in F1.It was a response, likely a blip, from a driver worn down by having to deal with adapting to his new team under such scrutiny as well as dissatisfaction at how they, and he, are performing. It is unusual for Hamilton to be so publicly hard on himself and perhaps represents real frustration withFerrari, but he has proved repeatedly he is nothing if not a fighter.A step back after what has been a gruelling opening with a new team is clearly required even if, as is believed, he feels there is still enormous work to be done at the Scuderia. Hamilton accepted the process to adapt would take time, but that frustration in Hungary suggests he could be disillusioned despite his belief Ferrari have everything needed to return to the top.He said rather dejectedly in Budapest he would “hopefully” return after the summer break. The touch is still there, as he proved in Silverstone and Spa, but he, perhaps like no other driver, could benefit from a reset over the summer break.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneOscar PiastriLando NorrisMax VerstappenLewis HamiltonFerrariRed BullfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Petchey’s TV commitments meant he was always unable to become Raducanu’s full-time coach and after a trial with Roig following Wimbledon, the 22-year-old will begin work with him in Cincinnati this week. He has agreed a contract until the end of 2025.Emma Raducanu knocked out of Canadian Open in straight sets loss to Amanda AnisimovaRead moreRaducanu has struggled to settle with a coach in recent years until her part-time work with Petchey started to pay dividends earlier this season. A WTA 1000 quarter-final showing at the Miami Open in March was followed by a last-16 run at the Italian Open before she made the last eight in the first women’s tournament at Queen’s Club.Aryna Sabalenka proved too strong for Raducanuin round three at Wimbledon, but this was backed up by a semi-final at the Citi Open as the British No 1 targets being seeded at the US Open later this month. Petchey, who worked with Andy Murray at the start of his career, revealed in July that Raducanu would need to find a full-time coach soon and she has found that in Roig.The Spanish coach worked with Nadal alongside Nadal’s uncle Toni for most of the 22-time grand slam champion’s career and more recently was part of Matteo Berrettini’s backroom staff.Raducanu will stay close to Petchey but turns her focus back to rising up the WTA rankings with a strong display at the Cincinnati Open over the next fortnight.Djokovic pulls out of Cincinnati OpenNovak Djokovic is set to enter the US Open without playing in any warm-up tournaments after he pulled out of the Cincinnati Open.Djokovic has not played since acomprehensive straight-sets loss to Jannik Sinnerin the Wimbledon semi-finals on 11 July.The 24-time grand slam champion struggled with a left thigh injury during his one-sided defeat at the All England Club and after he missed the Toronto Masters, the Serbian will now sit out another ATP 1000 event in the shape of the Cincinnati Open.After being included on the original acceptance list, an updated version on Monday showed Djokovic as a withdrawal.

France’s flagship daily sports newspaper, emblazoned with an image of a yellow-clad Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, arms outstretched and triumphant, with the banner headlineGeante,had almost sold out.Ferrand-Prévot, thefirst French rider to win the Tour de France Femmes, has become a national icon almost overnight. After her Paris 2024 gold medal performance in mountain biking and the Paris‑Roubaix win this spring, Ferrand-Prévot fever has taken over. Cycling’s slumbering giant has finally awoken.Mascots, dogs, and cogs: the Tour de France Femmes 2025 – in picturesRead moreAs a little girl, Ferrand-Prévot asked her mother why it was that she couldn’t race in the Tour de France. “But it’s a men’s race,” came the response. “I wish I was a boy,” the nine-year-old Pauline said.The French have waited a long time to see one of their own in the yellow jersey – 36 years in women’s racing and 40 in men’s – and endured decades of humiliation plus an ingrained sense of inferiority, usually to multiple foreign champions, some of them doped.During that time, there have been other misfiring women’s tours of France, but none of them compare with the significance and scale of the modernTour de France Femmes, which Christian Prudhomme, race director of the men’s Tour and initially sceptical of the women’s race, now sees as equal in stature.For archivists, the last French rider in yellow was Jeannie Longo, who won the Tour de France Féminin in 1989, although that race did not compare with the investment, difficulty and global importance of the modern Tour Femmes.Justifiably, Ferrand-Prévot has been depicted as the successor to Bernard Hinault, the last French winner of the men’s Tour. The celebratory televised phone call from President Macron, within minutes of her victory in Châtel, is evidence of that.Ferrand-Prévot’s Olympic gold came while she was sponsored by Ineos Grenadiers, but their reluctance to invest further in women’s racing led to her off‑season move to the Visma Lease-a-bike team, and a vow to win the Tour within three years. Jim Ratcliffe’s loss has become the Dutch sponsor’s gain.For the French, this was equivalent to England men’s long‑awaited home Ashes win in 2005, or Andy Murray’s breakthrough British Wimbledon victory in 2013. The 33-year-old may well have uncorked fresh ambition within the host nation, and not just in women’s racing.Compare Tadej Pogacar’s muted celebrations afterwinning his fourth Tour de Francea week ago in Paris with the party vibe in Châtel late on Sunday evening and the differences between the men’s and women’s Tour are far greater than just of gender.In stark contrast, there is an openness, joy and freedom of expression to the Tour de France Femmes that puts the monastic and secretive world of its occasionally lumbering male counterpart to shame.View image in fullscreenPauline Ferrand-Prévot celebrates as she crosses the finish line to win the final stage and the race.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAFerrand-Prévot came to the Tour Femmes parchment thin, compared to the rider who powered to victory over the cobbles of Paris-Roubaix in April. The dramatic weight loss enhanced her power-to-weight ratio, but it doesn’t look good and she has readily acknowledged it.“I don’t want to stay like this, because I know it’s not 100% healthy,” she said on Sunday evening, “but we also had a good plan with the nutritionist in the team and everything is in control. I didn’t do anything extreme, and I still had power left after nine days of racing. It’s a tricky subject, because you have to find the limit. I also know that I can’t stay like this forever. It’s the choice I made.”The already lean Demi Vollering, second overall in Châtel, an athlete who has openly talked about teenage mental health and menstrual cycles, also faced questions on whether she would now seek to lose weight to become more competitive.“I could lose weight too, but I don’t want to be extremely thin,” she said. “I’m proud of my weight and want to set a good example. I hope that in the future I can win again and show girls that you don’t have to be super skinny, but that you can also win with hard work and power.“I know that many others struggle with this, so I hope that young girls don’t think they have to be super skinny to ride in the mountains.”Kasia Niewiadoma, the outgoing champion, highlighted the fast-track development in ability within the women’s peloton and said that her own level was “definitely higher” than that of a year ago.“This is the growth of women’s cycling,” she said after finishing third. “I think that the teams are stronger. You can see that a lot of teams have grown in depth – they have really strong riders who can help their leaders.”Of course, the Tour Femmes is not perfect. As the pressure to perform grows along with the rewards, it will inevitably develop some of the same ethical issues that confront men’s racing. But, right now it is refreshing, joyous, dramatic and exciting, with a growing roster of accomplished athletes.“Watch The Femmes” say the caps tossed to the crowds from the publicity caravan. “We don’t need the men any more to exist,” the race director Marion Rousse said earlier this summer after announcing the move to stand‑alone dates for the Femmes in 2026. Rousse is right. Maybe we have been watching the wrong race all along.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are the endless comments online that deride it and then the kids at the ground, rocking their Southern Brave merch and living in a different world. This is a transformative competition for women’s cricket that has also produced a wild, maddening gap in pay. The highest earners in the men’s tournament this year will make £200,000, £135,000 more than the best women’s players; the difference in 2024 was £75,000.There is the mind-numbing debate over whether it should be a Twenty20 show, when the rhythm and beat is the same as that format. Another 20 balls in each innings is unlikely to lead to some utopia. The big one remains this, four seasons down: this is a cricket tournament in which the cricket is always battling for centrality, competing against the big-picture existential questions. Is it cutting through on the BBC? Will it expand? How does the rest of the summer fit around it? Whether David Willey should bowl 10 up front with the new ball becomes increasingly small fry.ECB admits no evidence Hundred has attracted new fans to other forms of cricketRead moreNaturally, in discussing the latest edition – which begins at Lord’s on Tuesday – we can not kick off with a breakdown of Trent Rockets’ spin stocks. The off season brought the great sell-off, the sale of stakes in all eight teams producing an incoming windfall upwards of £500m. Four Indian Premier League sides entered the picture: Sun Group, which owns Sunrisers Hyderabad, bought Northern Superchargers outright while RPSG Group, which runs Lucknow Super Giants, acquired a 70% stake in Manchester Originals.The England and WalesCricketBoard (ECB) rejoiced, with struggling counties suddenly able to address their wishlists. Six of the eight sales have been completed, with deals for Oval Invincibles and Rockets still “on track”, according to the ECB. The new team owners will be granted “operational control” in October. This is a placeholder season before the uber-rich enter their playground.For theIPLfranchises, it is a chance to continue their empire-building, all of them already in possession of teams in leagues elsewhere. The Originals and Superchargers are expected to change their names and the Invincibles – about to join the Mumbai Indians family (their affiliates include MI New York and MI Cape Town) – have been tipped for a re-brand, too.For others it is a chance to turn childhood fandom into something more active. On the Sky Cricket Podcast in February, Nikesh Arora, leading a consortium of tech bros that forked out on London Spirit, explained the group’s motivations. “The best way to describe us is kids who wanted to be really good at cricket, who didn’t get there, who want to be back involved with the game.” And why the Spirit? “There is only one Lord’s, only one team that is connected to the home of cricket.”Ultimately, this is a purchase that goes far beyond a four-year-old competition, the value coming in the history English cricket wrote for itself in the centuries before.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A potential battle with David Warner, who will play for the Spirit, could be a thrill. It could also end up with the vibe of a testimonial, a reminder of what is not happening while this is on.The club to challenge remains the Invincibles, who have won four titles, two each for the men and women. Marizanne Kapp is the clutch overseas all-rounder who rocks up every year and Alice Capsey has been doing this since she was 16. Capsey is joined again by Ryana MacDonald-Gay and Paige Scholfield, all three part of the Surrey side that triumphed in the Women’s Blast final in July. Meg Lanning is their big-name addition.The Curran brothers are constants for the men, alongside Will Jacks and Sam Billings; the men’s Invincibles have six of the XI that played in their first game four years ago. There is a welcome familiarity here that often goes missing in the franchise world, where teams undergo extreme makeovers from one season to the next. This is a club that has been building an identity, only for an unclear picture to emerge as new investors arrive with their own ideas.If you want certainty with the Hundred, there is this: this season marks the end of its turbulent beginning.Explore more on these topicsThe HundredCricketIPLJimmy AndersonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fifa and the five domestic FAs have been given until September to respond.The compensation claim is the result of the CJEU judgment last Octoberin the case brought by former Chelsea and France midfielder Lassana Diarra, who sued Fifa after the world governing body refused to issue him with an international transfer certificate (ITC) to join the Belgian club Charleroi in 2016 after he was found to have breached his contract with Lokomotiv Moscow two years earlier.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Fifa fined Diarra €10.5m and suspended him from football for 15 months for breaching his contract, in a ruling upheld on appeal at the court of arbitration for sport.

Fifa has amended its transfer regulations, although the new rules have not been accepted by the international players’ union, Fifpro.The Justice for Players foundation is understood to have been set up this year with the intention of bringing a mass legal action.Diarra’s lawyer, Jean-Louis Dupont, who won the landmark case at the CJEU on behalf of Jean-Marc Bosman that established the principle of free movement for players out of contract, in 1995, is advising Justice for Players.The legal letter sent to Fifa makes reference to the class action being a multibillion claim. This figure is understood to be based on independent analysis from economists at Compass Lexecon, who have estimated that players would have earned about 8% more over their careers since 2002 had Fifa’s transfer regulations not been unlawfully restrictive.The CJEU judgment ruled that Fifa’s regulations restricted free movement by establishing unlawful criteria for determining compensation to be paid by a player who breaks their contract, allowing the national federation of the former club to withhold a player’s ITC, making the player’s new club liable for the compensation to be paid to the former club and allowing Fifa to impose disciplinary sanctions on the player and their new club.Fifa has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFootballFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Ken McCallum, its current chief, said she was “the first avowed female head of any intelligence agency in the world” and praised her for breaking “through longstanding barriers”. She was, he added: “A visible example of the importance of diversity in leadership.”Dame Stella Rimington obituaryRead moreAn accidental spy, recruited in the mid-1960s as a typist when her husband, John, was posted to India on diplomatic service, Rimington rose through the ranks to end up as chief of the Security Service between 1992 and 1996.After her appointment as director general, she was the first chief of the agency to be named, although no photograph was supplied at first and the only image available was a blurry picture of her in the street wearing a distinctive raincoat.“I’m proud that I was the first woman DG and that, during the time I was there, MI5 changed from being an old-fashioned closet organisation,” she said in aninterview in 2011as she reflected on her secret career.In her first interview after leaving the agency in 2001,with the Guardian, Rimington said she was drawn to the world of espionage despite the fact that when she started at the agency “there were all of these tweedy guys with pipes”.“I still thought the essence of the cold war and spies and stuff was fun. You know, going around listening to people’s telephones and opening their mail and stuff,” she added, though she also conceded MI5 was “overenthusiastic” during the cold war.Rimington held roles in MI5 units tackling counter-subversion, counter-espionage and counter-terrorism, and she acknowledged that MI5 was involved in assessing threats to national security posed by leaders of the miners’ strike in 1984-85.She was also involved in debriefing the star British agentOleg Gordievskyafter he was extracted from the Soviet Union by MI6 in the mid-1980s. Gordievskysaid laterhe “liked her as a woman immensely”, though Rimington said in a documentary she was unaware of the romantic impression she had made on the defector.During her time as MI5’s director general she oversaw an agency making a wider transition from tackling the cold war threat to terrorism, and was the first agency chief to give a public lecture to the BBC.View image in fullscreenRimington turned to writing after leaving MI5, including her autobiography, Open Secret, published in 2001.Photograph: Dan Chung/Reuters“I have set out in this lecture to show that a security service such as MI5 is compatible with personal liberty within our democracy,” she said. Such was her profile, she was considered a model for Judi Dench’s portrayal of M, the fictional chief of sister agency MI6, in a series of James Bond movies.After leaving MI5, Rimington principally became a writer. Her first book was a memoir, Open Secret, published in 2001, though there was a furious row about her decision to write an autobiography at the time. Particular objections came from the SAS, and she was ordered to remove all references to the elite special forces.A series of novels followed, eight with Liz Carlyle, an MI5 officer as the lead character, and two more with Manon Tyler, a CIA agent. In one of her books, Rip Tide, published in 2011, she sent up American officials who imagined that al-Qaida could be bombed into submission.“I’m tweaking the Americans’ tails,” she said, having previously argued in 2009 the US had “gone too far with Guantánamo and the tortures” in an interview with a Spanish newspaper.Born as Stella Whitehouse in 1935, she moved from London to Barrow-in-Furness aged four, and remembered the port town being repeatedly bombed during the war. She married John Rimington in 1963 and they had two daughters, but the couple separated in 1984.Rimington and her husband never divorced, however, and she and John became friends again later in life, living together during the Covid lockdown. “Yes, we argued, but we’ve mellowed. It’s a good recipe for marriage, I’d say: split up, live separately, and return to it later,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMI5UK security and counter-terrorismCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

He faced federal charges of coercing girlfriends into having drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers while he watched and filmed them.He was acquitted last month of the top charges – racketeering and sex trafficking – while being convicted of two counts of a prostitution-related offense.The conviction carries the potential for up to 10 years in prison. But there are complicated federal guidelines for calculating sentences in any given case, and prosecutors and Combs’s lawyers disagree substantially on how the guidelines come out for his case.In any event, the guidelines are not mandatory, and Arun Subramanian, the judge, will have wide latitude in deciding Combs’s punishment.The Bad Boy Records founder, now 55, was for decades a protean figure in pop culture. A Grammy-winning hip-hop artist and entrepreneur with a flair for finding and launching big talents, he presided over a business empire that ranged from fashion to reality TV.Trump says Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’s past comments make pardoning him ‘more difficult’Read moreProsecutors claimed he used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate two now-ex-girlfriends into days-long, drugged-up sexual performances he called “freak-offs” or “hotel nights”.His lawyers argued that the government tried to criminalize consensual, if unconventional, sexual tastes that played out in complicated relationships. The defense acknowledged that Combs had violent outbursts but said nothing he did came amounted to the crimes with which he was charged.Since the verdict, his lawyers have repeatedly renewed their efforts to get him out on bail until his sentencing, set for October. They have argued that the acquittals undercut the rationale for holding him, and they have pointed to other people who were released before sentencing on similar convictions.Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested in a court filing that Combs was the US’s “only person in jail for hiring adult male escorts for him and his girlfriend”.The defense’s most recent proposalincluded a $50m bondand travel restrictions and expressed openness to adding on house arrest at his Miami home, electronic monitoring, private security guards and other requirements.Prosecutors opposed releasing Combs. They wrote that his “extensive history of violence – and his continued attempt to minimize his recent violent conduct – demonstrates his dangerousness and that he is not amendable to supervision”.Explore more on these topicsSean ‘Diddy‘ CombsNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

On Monday, the Met announced that the Health and Safety Executive, the body which investigates accidents, had been informed.Witnesses who were 3 metres (10ft) from where the man landed said he fell from the upper tier of Wembley’s block 511, on to the aisle between block 211 and block 210.Emma, 40, from Liverpool, said the man landed next to a row behind her and her partner, Mike, only five seats away.Oasis ‘shocked and saddened’ after fan dies in fall at Wembley concertRead more“I’ve been feeling awful ever since – I can’t stop thinking about him,” she said. “It happened directly behind our right shoulders. If he had fallen where someone was sitting, it would have killed both people.”Within seconds of the fall, several staff began trying to perform CPR on the man. Mike said: “It’s quite traumatic, seeing people just doing CPR on someone frantically. I haven’t been able to focus on anything else.”Emma and Mike, who declined to give their full names, urged Wembley to review safety and alcohol sales at the stadium.Emma said: “So much beer was being thrown throughout the whole concert. I was surprised they allowed people to bring drinks into the stands. It made the floor really slippy.”She added: “They should put the security guard at the bottom of all the aisles too, and permanently station them there to stop people falling off.”Mike, who works in health and safety, said: “Beer was coming from everywhere. I got hit by an empty cup right on the side of the head. If it had been full it would really have hurt. We started getting beer on us from the moment Oasis came on stage.”John, 52, a delivery driver from Oxford who also declined to give his full name, saw many fans leaning over the balcony from block 511.He said: “There were loads of people who just kept going down to the front and leaning right over. One guy was stopped but after that no security came down. The security was so lax. There’s a rail and a small guard but it did make me think someone could quite easily get knocked off there.”John added: “It seemed unsafe. If they’d have actually posted a security guard at the bottom of those steps, where people were continually going, it would have prevented the fall.”He was also surprised by the level of drinking at the gig. “The amount of alcohol that was sold on the night was quite shocking. I constantly saw people with cardboard cup holders full of pints,” John said.Last week the Times revealed that Oasis fans were consuming an average of250,000 pints a night during the Wembley gigs.A Wembley Stadium spokesperson said: “Wembley Stadium operates to a very high health and safety standard, fully meeting legal requirements for the safety of spectators and staff, and is certified to and compliant with the ISO 45001 standard.“We work very closely and collaboratively with all relevant event delivery stakeholders – including event owners, local authorities, the Sports Ground Safety Authority and the police – to deliver events to high standards of safety, security and service for everyone attending or working in the venue.”Saturday’s concert was the fourth of seven sold-out reunion gigs at Wembley. Despite the tragedy on Saturday, the fifth gig on Sunday went ahead as planned. The sixth and seventh gigs will be in September.Explore more on these topicsOasisLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The lack of moisture has caused embankments to shrink on a 12-mile stretch of track between Gillingham in Dorset and Axminster inDevon.The speed restrictions on the single-track route means trains cannot pass at the usual times and places, and SWR said it had been forced to cut services from the schedule.The operator said dry conditions were likely to continue and that further speed restrictions could be needed.SWR’s chief operating officer, Stuart Meek, said: “We are very sorry for the disruption that customers will experience due to this change, as we know just how important the west of England line is to the communities it serves.“We have not taken this decision lightly … However, to continue operating a safe and reliable service, we have no alternative but to introduce a reduced timetable.”Network Rail’s operations director, Tom Desmond, said: “The safety of our customers is our number one priority, which is why we must impose these speed restrictions.

The vastness of this high-altitude Ecuadorian moorland combines with its near-silence to create an empty, alien atmosphere.But this unique landscape teems with life. The páramo – a high-altitude tropical ecosystem that stretches across the northern Andes – is a living sponge, quietly drawing moisture from the clouds that drift at more than 3,000 metres (9,800ft) above sea level.Endangered mountain tapirs and endemichummingbirds hide among the twisted, copper-barkedPolylepistrees.Beneath the ground, ancient tectonic shifts and glaciers have cracked the bedrock, channelling water through veins that feed six large rivers, supplying mountain communities, cities and fragile ecosystems – including the Ecuadorian Amazon.View image in fullscreenThe Cajas has protected status, but environmentalists argue that mining in surrounding areas will still have an impact on it.That bedrock, however, also holds billions of dollars in gold, silver and copper. For more than three decades, these deposits have made the Cajas a battlefield between Ecuadorians who see large-scale mining as the answer to the country’s economic woes and those who see it as an existential threat.Breaking groundUnesco designated theCajas a biosphere reserve in 2013, but the title offers scant protection. Mining companies nowhold more than 100,000 hectares(247,000 acres) of concessions in the Cajas, with more than 15,000 of those hectares in the páramo.Authorities say that the government has given the most important segments of ecosystems protected or national park status. But scientists argue that the zoning is arbitrary.“What areas are ‘protected’ is a political decision, not a technical one,” says Juan Carlos Sánchez-Nivicela, a herpetologist and conservation biologist who has been studying Ecuador’s high-altitude ecosystems for more than a decade. “You can’t separate these areas. Any damage done to one directly affects the other.”View image in fullscreenGentianella hirculus,known as the Paramo tulip, is an endangered species that grows only in Ecuador’s páramo ecosystem.So far, large-scale mining activity in the páramos has been limited to exploration – in part, thanks to local resistance, inside and outside the courtroom. But now, new battle lines are being drawn in the Cajas.On 23 June, the Canadian mining multinational Dundee Precious Metals was granted its environmental licence for exploitation of the Loma Larga project, which sits on the Quimsacocha páramo and surrounds the protected area.“The company has satisfactorily fulfilled all requirements and prerequisites necessary … which is very difficult and time consuming in my country,” says Patricio Vargas Coronel, president of Cuenca’s Chamber ofMining.“It can now sign the mining contract and begin construction, generating about 1,200 jobs and an investment of $450m (£337m).”Dundee’s president and CEO, David Rae,touts the achievementas “an important milestone for Loma Larga – an attractive future growth opportunity for [Dundee] with significant potential to deliver strong returns for our investors and stakeholders”.View image in fullscreenThe páramo acts like a living sponge, drawing moisture from the air.Activists and ecologists, however, allege that the mine could cause enormous environmental damage, that the government has failed to properly consult local communities, and that they are subject to intimidation and surveillance for protesting against the mine. Dundee rejects the claims.Fragile ecosystems“We are being followed,” says Esther Remache, an anti-mining activist, pointing out the white pickup truck trailing behind.View image in fullscreenFederico Guzman, Cuenca councillor and anti-mining activist, in Quimsacocha.Photograph: Anastasia G Austin and Douwe Den Held/The Guardian“Oh, they’re just looking after us,” replies Federico Guzmán, councillor for Cuenca and another longtime activist, with a wink.The road to Loma Larga is public, and cuts through the Quimsacocha recreation area. Yet, it’s lined with private security personnel who peer out from booths guarding the offices and buildings of Dundee Precious Metals.As Guzman parks his vehicle, the pickup behind also stops and a guard exits, using his phone to film the group of activists, almost all of whom are over 60.“They always follow us when we go up here,” says Remache, who believes this is an intimidation technique. “They’ll openly photograph us … you have to wonder, what are those photos for?”In a letter to the Guardian, Dundee representatives denied these allegations, noting that all Loma Larga security personnel “have undergone human rights training and behave with full respect”. They said that the project’s fence had been frequently vandalised, and guards took action to prevent trespassing, but that Dundee “regularly welcomes visitors to the project area”.View image in fullscreenEsther Remache holds discarded fence material outside a mining concession in Quimsacocha.Quimsacocha, a páramo at an altitude between 3,600m and 3,900m, is a vital water source and biodiversity refuge. It’s here that Sánchez-Nivicela says herediscovered a tiny frogthought to be extinct.“There’s something like 20-plus amphibian species in the Cajas: 80 to 90% of these are endemic – but we keep finding more each year,” he says.Frog back from the dead helps fight plans for mine in EcuadorRead moreScientists warn that mining in Cajas could irreversibly destroy fragile ecosystems and poison the water supply that hundreds of thousands of people depend on.“Protection is not just a matter of the environment,” says Sandra Barros, a municipal hydrology engineer who evaluated the risks of the Loma Larga project. “It is a matter of survival.”View image in fullscreenQuimsacocha is an important water source and biodiversity refuge.Several past referendums held in affected communities had rejected mining in local watersheds. In 2023, a provincial court upheld the decision to suspend the Loma Larga project, but also opened the door for Dundee to revive its project if new environmental studies and local consultations showed support.A new era of Ecuadorian miningIn April, Daniel Noboa, the country’s recently re-elected president, extended the Loma Larga concession for another 25 years. In 2024, he attended theworld’s largest mining conference in Canadato reassure investors that a new era of Ecuadorian mining was dawning.Currentgold prices value Loma Larga’s estimated deposits at more than $6bn. Ecuador’s government also stands tomakehundreds of millions from the project.On 23 June, the country’s environmental ministry quietly approved the project’s environmental licence – the final hurdle for Dundee to begin exploitation.View image in fullscreenThe site of Dundee Precious Metals camp in Quimsacocha, where the company is currently in the exploration phase.Dundee’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) for Loma Larga claimed mining posed only a “mild risk” to the ecosystem. However, astudy by themunicipal water and sanitation company(ETAPA) claimed there were dozens of errors and omissions in that assessment. It concluded mining risked serious, potentially irreversible damage to nature, water resources, and public health in the Quimsacocha region.Other studiescorroborate the ETAPA’s findings.“Do you think contamination would stop at some arbitrary red line just because [the mining company] says that’s where their impact stops? Of course not. Any contamination will end up in the rivers downstream,” says Barros, the ETAPA study’s main author.Dundee, however, called the ETAPAreport “misinformation” and says that it is “designing and advancing Loma Larga in line with the highest standards for environmental and water management”, pointing to the positive results of its EIA, the evaluation and approval of which “is the sole responsibility of the ministry for the environment, not ETAPA”.The environment ministry did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment,and on July 24, Noboa eliminated the environment ministry entirely, transferring its responsibilities to fall under the ministry for mining.Mother of all battlesEcuador’s constitution requires the government to consult local and Indigenous communities before allowing any mining project to begin.Under Noboa, however,allegations of irregularitiesin this process have become so widespread that UN human rights officialsissued a formal warninglast year, saying Indigenous groups and local communities were being excluded from consultations, not offered complete information, and arrested for protest or criticism of projects.“We are concerned that the failure to convene all potentially affected people, together with the lack of full and impartial information regarding the potential negative consequences of these projects have exacerbated social conflict,” the UN experts say.In other parts of Ecuador, thegovernment has responded to protests with force. When communities protested against Canadian mining in Ecuador’s north-western cloud forest last year, Noboa sent in the military. Security forces injured at least 36 people, and more than 100 were charged with terrorism or organised crime offences.In May, the ministry of energy and mines (MEM)said authorities had finished consultinglocal communities on Loma Larga, and reported that they had agreed to let the project proceed to exploitation. Communities had “access to ample, timely and adequate information” on the vote, MEM said.But community members and activists had a starkly different view of the consultation: of eight interviewed, not one said they knew that it had taken place.View image in fullscreenThe Dundee mine site is fenced off and guarded by private security officers.They recalled a day in January, when the environment ministry sent 200 police and troops to “oversee” a vote on the mine outside town. Instead, one said, authorities were forced to cancel the vote.“People saw the soldiers, the militarised area, the tents and they showed up to protest,” says Nataly Torres, a sociologist and member of the community.‘Live sick or flee’: pollution fears for El Salvador’s rivers as mining ban liftedRead moreIn its report, MEM characterises the protest as “violent incidents … restricting the right of other members of the community to be consulted”. Dundee says it cooperated with all of Ecuador’s “strict and well-defined regulations”. In a statement, the ministry said that communities had been consulted in accordance with the law.The fear of state violence now hangs over environmental defenders in the Cajas region as well, activists say.“Now, they have bigger, deadlier arms, and they use them to intimidate us,” Remache says.View image in fullscreenEsther Remache looks out towards a mining concession in Quimsacocha.And the stakes are high for biodiversity, water and communities. “Any disturbance, any change in land use, any extractive activity [in the Cajas] will directly affect species that have nowhere else to go,” Sánchez says. ”We’ll lose not only unique species but also the water supplying entire communities,” he adds.And the outcome here may set a precedent for the rest of Ecuador.“This is the mother of all battles,” says Carlos Castro, a legal professor and opponent of mining in the region. “If we lose here, the rest will fall like dominoes.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentThe age of extinctionMiningAccess to waterIndigenous peoplesEndangered habitatsEndangered speciesEcuadorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On the same day, local temperature records were broken in 39 locations – including in Kyoto, which reached 40C for the first time – with almost a third of the Japan Meteorological Agency’s weather stations reporting highs above 35C. This is the third year in a row that the July average temperature record has been broken, with July 2025 closing out at 2.89C above the 1991-2020 average.In a similarly sweltering South Korea, Seoul had a record-breaking 22 consecutive “tropical nights”, a term used by the Korea Meteorological Administration when overnight temperatures fail to fall below 25C. On Thursday, the minimum overnight temperature in the capital was 29.3C.With August typically the hottest month of the year for both countries, fears are now growing for what may lie ahead. There is some respite on the horizon. Temperatures are expected to fall back to climate average by the weekend. However, long-term forecast models suggest that temperatures will trend above average throughout the latter part of August and into September. The summers of 2023 and 2024 were jointly the warmest recorded in Japan, while 2024 was one of South Korea’s warmest years overall – records that could fall by the end of 2025.Meanwhile, the start of August was unusually wet and chilly for parts of eastern Australia. Complex low pressure systems to the east of the continent brought frequent rain to New South Wales, with large swathes of the eastern coast recording 100-200mm since the start of the month – around double the August average. This moist air flowing in from the Tasman Sea collided with colder air already sitting over eastern Australia. The fallout was a rare significant snowfall event over higher ground in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, where as much as 40cm fell in places – the heaviest for at least 20 years.While there was significant disruption, with more than 27,000 homes losing power and about 200 vehicles becoming stranded, the snowfall was a positive experience for many. “Snow tourists” flocked to affected areas from further afield to enjoy the rare winter wonderland, some of whom came to see snow for the first time in their lives.Explore more on these topicsJapanWeather trackerSouth KoreaExtreme heatAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

Every day I was researching how to get way with murder.“I have come close. I have killed cats to reduce my urges. I have skinned, strangled and stabbed cats.”The teenager, along with a 17-year-old girl, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animals by mutilating and killing them.The pair also each admitted one count of possession of a knife at Ruislip golf course.There was no reaction from the boy as he stood in the dock and was handed a 12-month detention and training order. The girl, who also cannot be named, was sentenced to nine months in custody.Valerie Benjamin, prosecuting, told the court the boy’s “sadistic” actions showed a degree of planning in looking for animals, researching how to kill them and his “desire to go on to killing humans and how it would be to get away with murder and killing a homeless person”.A month after their arrest, the pair were reported missing and were found at a bus stop with a bag containing clothes, toiletries and tins of tuna, the Metropolitan police said.The boy admitted his role in the animal cruelty during his police interview, Benjamin said. He had no previous convictions.She added: “He gave a prepared statement saying he was sorry for what he had done and took responsibility saying he was in a bad state of mind.“He said he suffered depression, anxiety, hallucinations and self-harm.”Explore more on these topicsLondonCrimeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

One diet was made up of UPFs while the other comprised minimally processed foods.When the first group ate breakfast bars and ready-made lasagne, for example, the second ate oats soaked in milk and natural yoghurt and homemade spaghetti bolognese.At the end of the trial, participants on the second diet had lost twice as much weight as those on the first.View image in fullscreenProf Chris van Tulleken, one of the study’s authors, said the results showed the need for government policy to change.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockProf Chris van Tulleken, an author of the study and of the book Ultra-Processed People, said: “The global food system at the moment drives diet-related poor health and obesity, particularly because of the wide availability of cheap, unhealthy food.“This study highlights the importance of ultra-processing in driving health outcomes in addition to the role of nutrients like fat, salt and sugar. It underlines the need to shift the policy focus away from individual responsibility and on to the environmental drivers of obesity, such as the influence of multinational food companies in shaping unhealthy food environments.”The study by University College London and UCL hospitals NHS trust was designed to address the lack of good-quality evidence on the health outcomes of UPFs. The findings suggest that choosing minimally processed foods and cooking from scratch as much as possible rather than buying ultra-processed packaged foods or ready meals may be more effective for losing weight.Minimally processed means that a food has undergone limited alteration from its natural state, for example fruits, vegetables, whole grains, meat, fish and dairy products such as natural yoghurt. UPFs have been significantly altered and typically contain ingredients not commonly used in home cooking, such as artificial flavours, preservatives and emulsifiers.People who followed the UPF diet consumed 120 calories fewer than usual and lost 1% of their weight on average during the study. Those who followed the minimally processed diet consumed 290 calories fewer and lost 2% of their weight on average, including much more fat mass. Over a year, this could scale up to a 13% weight reduction for men and 9% for women, the researchers said.Dr Samuel Dicken, the first author of the study, said that while previous research has linked UPFs with poor health outcomes, not all are “inherently unhealthy”. But, he explained, because UPFs have a softer texture and are more calorie-dense, they do make it easier to overeat.View image in fullscreenDieters in the UPF group started their day with breakfast bars.Photograph: UCLThe study, published in Nature Medicine, split 55 adults with an average BMI of 32, indicating obesity, into two groups, who followed one diet for eight weeks, returned to their normal diet for four weeks, and then swapped to the other diet for another eight weeks.The diets were nutritionally matched in accordance with government advice on healthy eating from theEatwell Guide. Participants had food containing more calories than they needed delivered to their homes and were told to eat as much or as little as they wanted, as they would normally.Participants also completed questionnaires to assess food cravings, which found significant improvements in the number of cravings and ability to resist them on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF one – despite the fact that weight loss is often associated with stronger cravings.The team recommended that policymakers use warning labels, marketing restrictions, progressive taxation and subsidies to increase awareness and make healthy diets affordable for all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Healthy food is up to two times more expensive than unhealthy food.”Rob Percival, the Soil Association’s head of food policy, said: “For decades, the UK government’s ‘healthy eating’ guidelines have neglected processing, assuming that whole foods and ultra-processed products might deliver the same health outcomes. We now know that to be false.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the government had commissioned research to understand more about the health impacts of UPFs and was “committed to tackling obesity and building a healthier Britain”.Meanwhile, the NHS should do more to help those who have come off a course of obesity drugs or just finished a weight loss programme, to ensure they do not regain the pounds they have lost.Such people should receive regular check-ups, advice and tailored action plans to help ensure they stay healthy, according to the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence.How do thediets compare?Minimally processedBreakfast: Cinnamon and apple overnight oatsLunch: Mexican chicken with salad and flatbreadDinner: Home-cooked cottage pie with green beans and cornUltra processedBreakfast: Oat and fruit breakfast barLunch: Meal deal-style packaged chicken tikka wrapDinner: Ready-made cottage pie with greens and cornExplore more on these topicsUltra-processed foodsDiets and dietingFoodHealthNutrition (Life and style)Nutrition (Science)Food sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

The company revealed the size of the pay packets only after the Guardian raised questions about the ability of MPs and billpayers to scrutinise the sums awarded.A Yorkshire Water spokesperson said it complied fully with Ofwat’s requirements on pay disclosure and bonus payments, and that the extra payments relating to work for Kelda Holdings were paid by shareholders rather than billpayers.Yorkshire Water’s group structureExecutive pay at water companies has come under close scrutiny in recent years amid public anger oversewage overflows into Britain’s rivers and seas. That prompted the government first to ban water companies from using money from customer bills to pay bonuses, and then to ban bonuses for the chief executives and finance bosses of companies responsible for serious environmental pollution.Yorkshire Water, which was allowed to raise average annual household bills by 41% to £607, was one ofthe six companies bannedfrom paying bonuses. However, the extra money paid by Kelda Group meant Shaw still made more than £1.3m during the 2024-25 financial year – nearly double the salary reported by Yorkshire Water Services, the subsidiary regulated by Ofwat.The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are aware of these payments, which Ofwat are currently assessing as a matter of urgency.“Undeserved bonuses for water company bosses have now been banned as part of the government’s plan to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good. Any instances of companies trying to circumvent the new rules are completely unacceptable.“The government will leave no stone unturned in clawing back any payments if found to be against the rules.”However, a person with knowledge of Ofwat’s thinking has suggested that the payments are not likely to contravene rules that are narrowly focused on “performance-related” pay, meaning remuneration that does not change from year to year would not be banned.Ofwat has previously raised concerns about the use of offshore corporate structures by water companies, pushing for several of them toclose subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands jurisdiction. Ofwat’s bonus rules would ban performance-related pay even from offshore parent companies, but non-variable fees are unlikely to be covered.Yorkshire Water declined to provide the accounts for Kelda Holdings, which are not publicly available, so it is unclear how the payments were explained.A spokesperson for the utility previously said the fees of £660,000 a year had been “introduced from 1 April 2023 and have remained the same for both years”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Ilkley Clean River Group has written to Vanda Murray, the chair of Kelda Holdings and Yorkshire Water, suggesting that the extra payments from Kelda Holdings undermined a gesture made by Shaw when shepublicly turned down a bonus in May 2023– a month after the offshore payments had been quietly introduced.In June 2023 Shaw said she would forgo a bonus of between £600,000 and £800,000, saying: “I get why people are angry. Seeing sewage in our rivers and seas isn’t right.”Shaw joined Yorkshire Water in May 2022, after a senior job at the National Grid and aschief executive of the High Speed 1 railway line. Including the offshore company payments, she has been awarded £3.8m in total pay over three years.Ilkley is a picturesque West Yorkshire spa town whose river, the Wharfe, wasgranted bathing water status in 2020, althoughpersistent pollution has threatened that designation. The campaigners, led by Prof Becky Malby, wrote: “It appears that the payments from Kelda Holdings bring Ms Shaw’s salary to the level she would expect if she had taken her bonuses.“To the customer the additional payments to Ms Shaw look like a way of ‘working around’ the fact that bonuses were causing public outrage and subsequently banned by government. There is in effect no change to eye-watering salaries at the top of Yorkshire Water.”Yorkshire Water declined to comment further.Explore more on these topicsExecutive pay and bonusesYorkshireWater industryUtilitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The group is part of a global network of similar Facebook pages used by women to seek information about their partners, and warn others of “red flags” from men they have dated.Sarah commented on the original post, saying she and her ex-boyfriend were together for almost five years, “and then he cheated on me and gaslit me saying I was wrong”.She then made her own post in the group, warning other women about her ex-partner. “I was basically just saying that I just want to warn other women,” she said.Through the group, she said, she found out more information about her ex-partner’s behaviour while they were together, and sent him two messages. In one she called him a “pussy”, and then blocked his number.“I messaged him and just basically said, the audacity of you to blame me for the breakdown of our relationship,” she said.“I thought nothing of it until 13 May, when I got a knock on my door, well, banging on my door, at 4.45 in the morning.”Sarah opened the door to three police officers, who told her they were there to arrest her for alleged harassment. “I knew instantly that it was him,” she said.“They took me in, they took my phone, they took my computer, they put me in the back of a van,” she added.She spent about 12 hours in custody, where she was questioned about the messages andFacebookposts.During questioning, Sarah said, she did not dispute any of the evidence police officers put before her.“I’ve got nothing to hide. I’m not ashamed of what I’ve done. I’m doing it to protect women, and if I can just save one woman going through what I’ve gone through, then I’ve done something,” she said.She said police asked her if it was true she had called her ex “a pussy”. “I was like, yeah, you can’t arrest me for calling someone a pussy, that’s ridiculous.”After questioning, she was released without charge. The duty solicitor, Sarah said, told her that in his opinion, “this wouldn’t have happened if [her ex] wasn’t a police officer”.After her release, a police officer came to Sarah’s house and served her with civil court papers, with her ex-partner seeking a non-molestation order.The court rejected his application, expressing concern about “the applicant’s abuse of power in respect of the respondent being arrested at 4.45am by three police officers and a riot van attending the respondent’s property, [and] the applicant’s request for a detective to personally serve the respondent”.Dismissing his application, court papers said it “related to one Facebook post on 6 May 2024 and no other allegations had been raised by the applicant in support of a non-molestation order”.Sarah made a formal complaint, claiming her former partner had abused his position as a police officer by seeking her arrest, but this was rejected after nine months.As part of the investigation, her ex-partner said he had reported her behaviour because she posted details of the police station he worked at.In a letter, an inspector told Sarah that “the service provided [was] acceptable”, and “I do not consider unsatisfactory performance procedures are appropriate in respect of any officers.”“Financially, if I had all the money in the world, I would push and push and push to take this further with lawyers behind our backs,” Sarah said. “But unfortunately, we don’t have the financing to do that.”She said the experience had “changed her whole life”, and that she sometimes had panic attacks when she saw police officers in the street.“I’m struggling to go out and just enjoy myself for the fear that he’s going to be there and he’s going to think that I’m following him,” she added.A Metropolitan police spokesperson said: “In May 2024 officers arrested a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of harassment. After an interview under caution, she was released without further action.“Subsequently, allegations were made relating to an abuse of power by a serving Met officer. These were formally investigated and found to be unsubstantiated.“The action taken in this case was considered to be necessary, proportionate and compliant with thePoliceand Criminal Evidence Act as officers need to conduct prompt and effective investigations.”*Name has been changed.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMetropolitan policeFacebookWomenCrimeSocial medianewsShareReuse this content"

When asked what message Witkoff would take to Russia and whatVladimir Putincould do to avoid new sanctions, the US president answered: “Yeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed.”In Kyiv, there is little expectation that Witkoff will make a breakthrough with Putin, but a hope that Trump’s changed rhetoric and tougher stance on Moscow may lead to a real change in US support forUkraine. Sources in Kyiv said they expected Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, to visit the country towards the end of the week, possibly to coincide with Witkoff’s visit to Moscow.Trump came into office convinced he could do a deal with Putin, but in recent weeks appears to have become increasingly frustrated with Russia’s actions. On Thursday he described its continued attacks on civilian areas in Ukraine as “disgusting” and on Sunday said that two nuclear submarines thathe ordered to be deployed after online threats from the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedevwere now “in the region”, without giving further details.Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on social media: “The concept of peace through strength works.”He added that the appearance of the submarines had silenced Medvedev, whom he described as “one Russian drunk who had just been threatening nuclear war on X”.Trump had initially announced in July a 50-day deadline forRussiaand Ukraine to end the war, but said last week he no longer believed Russia was serious about ending the war and shortened it to “10 or 12” days, later clarified as this Friday, 8 August.Trump has previously said the new measures he has in mind if the deadline is not met could involve “secondary tariffs” targeting Russia’s remaining trade partners, such as China and India.Mykhailo Podolyak, an aide to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said if Russia did not change its course by Friday, Kyiv would expect the “irreversible logistics” of secondary sanctions on Russian oil exports to be set in motion.“After that he’ll look whether this is helping to bring about the end of the war or not, and if not then he will move to the next step,” said Podolyak, in an interview in Kyiv.The next move, he said, could be further sanctions, and the increased militarisation of Ukraine. “Trump has already said he’s ready to sell Europe as much weapons as they want [to pass to Ukraine]. Before he didn’t say that … This is already a different conception of the world,” he said.Before that, though, all eyes will be on Witkoff’s visit to Moscow. On previous trips, he has held long one-on-one meetings with Putin and has spoken of his warm feelings for the Russian leader. On one occasion Putin gifted him an oil painting of Trump, on another, Witkoff arrived without an interpreter and used a Kremlin-provided translator.The camaraderie has left both Kyiv and other US allies wondering whether Witkoff is capable of delivering harsh messages to Moscow, although his visit this week will be the first since Trump’s rhetoric on Ukraine became noticeably harsher.The Kremlin said on Monday it was “always happy to see Mr Witkoff in Moscow” and a meeting with Putin was possible, the spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He described talks with Witkoff as “important, substantive and very useful”.Putin said on Fridaythat he was in favour of “a lasting and stable peace on solid foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and would ensure the security of both countries”.Despite periodically making such statements, Putin has also made clear that Russia’s maximalist war goals remain essentially unchanged, demanding as a minimum control over four Ukrainian regions to which Moscow has laid claim, and a commitment that Ukraine will never join Nato.Direct talks between Russia and Ukraine have taken place in Turkey, with the third round in Istanbul last month, but the last set of talks broke down in less than an hour and the only substantive outcome from the meetings has been a series of agreements on prisoner exchanges. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that a new exchange agreed at the last meeting in Istanbul would result in 1,200 Ukrainian troops returning home.Zelenskyy has said he wants to meet directly with Putin, with Trump or Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as a mediator, but the Russian president has said he sees no point in a meeting until the outline of a ceasefire has been drawn up. However, the delegation he sent to Turkey, led by the former culture minister and patriotic author Vladimir Medinsky, suggests the Kremlin is not serious about a deal.“Those countries who thought Russia was ready for talks, and that the war could end at any moment if Ukraine would only agree to negotiations, they can now see that Russia is not ready for any real talks,” said Podolyak.Russia continues to target Ukraine with almost nightly drone and missile attacks. Last week was one of the deadliest for some time in terms of civilian casualties, with one set of attacks on Kyiv killing 31 people, including five children.Both sides continue to target infrastructure in the opposing country with drones. Russia’s ministry of defence said on Monday that its air defences had intercepted 61 Ukrainian drones overnight.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyRussiaUkraineVladimir PutinDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

Aside from Baumbach-scripted acid insults, tracks include fireworks, gunshots and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.The practice is know as “wolf hazing” and is employed rather than culling as grey wolves are on the federal government’s list of endangered species.Happily, Driver and Johansson’s Academy Award-nominated performances have proved just as impactful for canines as humans.“Drones were deployed in the Klamath Basin of southern Oregon after 11 cows were killed by wolves there in a 20-day period,” reports the WSJ. “Over the next 85 days, when drones were on patrol, only two were killed.”Other emotionally volatile high-points in the 2019 film include Driver’s feeling rendition of Steven Sondheim’s Being Alive and Dern’scaustic broadsideabout the double standards by which mothers and fathers are judged (which found an echo in America Ferrera’s speech in the 2023 film Barbie, which was also co-written by Baumbach). It is not believed either of these moments are also being broadcast to pests.Marriage Story premiered at the Venice film festival in 2019 and was named on many critics’ best of the year lists, comingsecondon the Guardian’s year-end roundup.In his five starreviewof the film, Peter Bradshaw singled out the “central rage-filled confrontation” for praise. “This does feel theatrical,” he wrote, “but in such a lucid and intelligent way.”Explore more on these topicsMarriage StoryScarlett JohanssonAdam DriverAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

That rule would have required a $15,000 bond for tourist and business travelers from two dozen countries with10%or higher overstay rates, mostly in Africa.The newfederal registry noticeof the visa bond pilot program is scheduled to be published on 5 August.“The Pilot Program will enable the Department to assess the operational feasibility of posting, processing, and discharging visa bonds, in coordination with the Department of the Treasury (‘Treasury’) and the Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’), and to inform any future decision concerning the possible use of visa bonds to ensure nonimmigrants using these visa categories comply with the terms and conditions of their visas and timely depart the United States,” it states.Travelling to Trump’s US is a low-level trauma – here’s what Africans can do about itRead moreIt said it would announce the countries in question at the “Travel.State.Gov” website no fewer than 15 days before the pilot program takes effect. It also said the list might change, again with 15 days notice.Tourists and business travelers would receive their bonds back when they depart the US, are naturalized as a citizen or die, according to the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcementregulations.The original six-month pilot program was never implemented.A state department spokespersontold Reutersthat countries would be selected based on “high overstay rates, screening and vetting deficiencies, concerns regarding acquisition of citizenship by investment without a residency requirement, and foreign policy considerations”. The department did not provide an estimate on the number of applicants who could be affected.The Trump administration hascracked downon immigration to the US, including terminating temporary protected status for many people living in the US, and banning immigration visas outright for12 countries.The bond policy could build on the president’s travel ban, whichwent into effect in June, mainly impacting countries in the the Middle East and Africa. Chad, Eritrea, Haiti, Myanmar and Yemen were targeted under the ban and also havehigh rates of visa overstays. Other countries with high overstay rates include Burundi, Djibouti and Togo, Reuters said, citing federal data from 2023.The US Travel Association, a group that represents major tourism firms,said in a statementthat the scope of the visa bond pilot “appears to be limited”, affecting an estimated 2,000 applicants, likely from countries with low rates of travel to the US.The state department last month alsounveilednew guidance directing US diplomats to review the online activity of foreign students before issuing educational and exchange visas. Students who refuse to unlock their social media profiles will be suspected of hiding the activity from US officials.The announcement of the new policy comes as data has shown the US is suffering a sharp decline in tourism, includingan 11.6% decrease in overseas visitors in March, with the tourism industry expected to lose out on billions of dollars this year due to government actions.Travel from Canada and Mexico hasfallenby 20% year over year,accordingto the US Travel Association. That group has also warned about the impact of requiring visitors to pay a $250 “visa integrity fee”, which was included in Trump’ssweeping tax bill last month. That fee, if adopted, would beone of the highestin the world for a country to charge.There have also been increasing accounts of tourists and visitors with valid visasgetting detained by Ice, escalating fears that a trip to the US could carry serious risks.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Is this a thrilling innovation – or a pointless fad?Emma JohnMon 4 Aug 2025 03.01 EDTShareWig, robes and moves like Jagger. Rosamund Pike’s star turn as a crown court judge, at the National Theatre in London, has proved that there’s just one prop you need to turn even the most serious of subjects into a punk performance – a microphone. AndInter Aliais only the latest in a number of major openings to star the humble handheld: from Greek tragedy to Chekhov, the device seems to be increasingly common in West End productions.Microphones were integral toThomas Ostermeier’s meta-theatrical production of The Seagull at the Barbican, and Jamie Lloyd – having used handhelds to transformJames McAvoy into a rapping Cyrano de Bergeracthree years ago – has deployed them in both Shakespeare (Much Ado) and Lloyd Webber (Evita). And no production used them more controversially thanDaniel Fish’s Elektra, whose lead, Brie Larson, spoke her entire part into an on-stage amp, distorting her own voice with a range of effects pedals.The only power she has, the only chance of justice, is through the noise she makesMicrophones have been a source of contention in the theatre ever sinceTrevor Nunn introduced radio mics to the National in 1999. But a handheld isn’t something a director is trying to hide, unlike the miniature, hands-free microphones that audiences are now used to seeing actors wear. “Personally I think those things that sit on the top of people’s foreheads, like a bug, look silly,” says Fish. “But here the microphone becomes an instrument, right? It’s something that the actor can play with so it becomes a very dynamic thing.”While it might not have been in use in Sophocles’ time, Fish found it a fascinating proposition in the rehearsal room. “Elektra is about a woman who refuses to be quiet, so the idea of amplifying and centring her voice felt important,” he says. “This is a person for whom the only power that she has, the only chance of justice, is through the noise she makes.”View image in fullscreenHelped with the story … Cate Blanchett as Arkadina in The Seagull.Photograph: Marc BrennerOne of the memorable elements of Larson’s sonic performance was the way she sang, rather than spoke, the word “no” – highlighting just how many times it appears in the play, although the punk sensibility did divide the critics. Or, as Fish puts it, “the show pissed a lot of people off”.Ostermeier enjoys the “attitude” that handheld mics can bring to a performance (put one in a rehearsal room, and every actor wants to be the one holding it). “Of course, it’s about who has the power to talk and who is excluded, about status and power,” says the German director, “but it’s also about pop culture.” Ostermeier enjoys placing theatre within the context of the entertainment industry it belongs to: his Seagull kicked off with an actor performing some Billy Bragg, then asking the audience if they were ready for “a little bit of Chekhov”.In that deliberately meta production, on-stage microphones were employed throughout to help indicate when characters were speaking to each other or “performing” for a wider audience.Cate Blanchettfound it transformative for the part of Irina Arkadina, a famous actor and hopeless showoff: “They helped the story we wanted to tell,” says Ostermeier, “which is that Arkadina is completely lost in it. She doesn’t have a real relationship with other human beings any more without some form of media in between.”There is nothing new about handheld mics on stage, as all these directors are keen to point out: pioneers from the Wooster Group to Pina Bausch to Marina Abramović were using them in the 1970s. “It’s a technique that’s been around for a long time,” says Katie Mitchell, whose wordless, sonically driven workCow | Deerarrives at the Royal Court in September. “I’ve always been interested in how you can amplify the spoken voice without having to distort your body or your voice to make it sound louder,” says Mitchell, who has been working with microphones for decades now (in her own version of The Seagull in 2006, Hattie Morahan’s Nina whispered her lines into one).A healthy society should have a wide spectrum of performance modesIt’s a paradox of the microphone that while it presents as performative and even political, it can also bring us closer to the character’s subjective experience. “We’re being invited into a more intimate relationship – we can hear their saliva, their breathing,” says Mitchell. That requires technicians as sensitive and responsive as the performers themselves, such as Laura Hammond, the sound engineer who live-mixed the scenes in Elektra. “A lot of times everything just goes into the computer, everything is set,” says Fish, “and that makes me want to pull my hair out.”For some theatre lovers, the current vogue for on-stage amplification is less welcome. One veteran actor in Ostermeier’s own company, who like so many stage actors has trained his voice to fill large spaces, refuses to use microphones. “He’s annoyed because it’s a theatrical fashion,” says the director, “and he doesn’t want to be part of this fashion any more.”Mitchell acknowledges the challenge microphones represent to the proud tradition of voice work in theatre: “There’s a sense if you’re not allowing actors to use all their skill for vocal projection and you’re just mediating it with technology, this undermines that tradition.But I’m always of the position that a healthy society should have a wide spectrum of performance modes.”As ever, there’s a danger that a popular technique becomes a fad, used without a sense or purpose. “It moves from innovation to convention to cliche awfully quickly,” admits Fish. But right now, Mitchell believes the age of the microphone is something to be enjoyed. “All these practitioners have got good political or intellectual underpinnings – let’s celebrate it, and not police each other. Let’s just chill.”Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreRosamund PikeThomas OstermeierTrevor NunnBrie LarsonCate BlanchettfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The setting is Corsica, around the 1990s, in the coastal region of Ajaccio, famously the home of Napoleon. Lesia (played by nonprofessional Ghjuvanna Benedetti) is a moody 15-year-old girl living with her aunt, hanging out with her friends and boisterous extended family of cousins.School is out for the summer and Lesia appears to be getting into a romance with a local boy. Maybe because of this, or due to other reasons, she is ordered to leave her aunt’s house and go to the luxurious and fortified family compound of her widowed father. This is mob boss Pierre-Paul (superbly played by Saveriu Santucci), a heavy-set, slow-moving but intimidating patriarch who is perhaps displeased with her behaviour, but also gruffly tender and indulgent.Lesia soon senses that her dad and his consiglieri are discussing a recent attempted hit on his life, and the need for payback. At first, Lesia had been pining to go back home to her aunt, but soon she is thrilled to be an intimate witness, daughter and lieutenant to her father. Perhaps like Mary Corleone or Meadow Soprano, Lesia has an intense awareness of her own blueblood status and her father’s importance in the world, as well as his importance to her personally. She has, of course, long forgotten about her crush on that callow boy: her father is the real man in her life.The performances of Benedetti and Santucci in the long and intimate dialogue scenes that Colonna gives them are really outstanding, as Pierre-Paul sadly explains the endless cycle of revenge that is now his life, and which began when he had to avenge his father’s death more than three decades previously: “A young man’s anger … all human history is based on it.” We know what’s coming, of course, but the film shows that something in its very inevitability is shocking. An intensely atmospheric, absorbing and exciting drama.The Kingdom is in UK and Irish cinemas from 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsMafiaFranceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a movie about the eternal presence of the dead, which, along with the murmuringly restrained dialogue, makes it comparable to the work of Thai directorApichatpong Weerasethakul.The film’s two key characters unselfconsciously bear names that symbolise the nation. It is 2001, and Viet (Duy Bao Dinh Dao) and Nam (Thanh Hai Pham) are two twentysomething men who were babies when theVietnam warwas concluded. They are coal miners and are in love, often having sex actually down in the mine. These sequences are as bizarre as they are erotic, yet conceivably supposed to be understood on the level of a vision or dream, because the dark coal on which they recline looks like a starlit sky. This could be because the mine is a kind of secular underworld but also because there is surely something uncomfortable and unlikely about sex in these circumstances, as their relationship does perhaps have to kept secret above ground. There is, though, a moment of rare comedy in a line bifurcated with a pause, when they are asked: “When will you two get married … when will you get wives?”Nam is planning to leave Vietnam in a desperately dangerous container unit. But first he has to solve the inexpressibly painful question of where his late father’s remains are – he was killed in action during the war and his body never found. Nam’s mother Hoa (Thi Nga Nguyen), who has a shop selling coal briquettes, is having vivid dreams which she thinks will lead her to the spot, and his father’s old friend and disabled military comrade Ba (Le Viet Tung) has volunteered to join the search, perhaps with memories that he has not yet told anyone about. Their expedition takes them into the forested wilderness, to a whitefaced psychic who is apparently making a living helping people like Hoa, and then also tothe Ba Chuc Memorial to the 1978 massacre by the Khmer Rouge, with its horrendous display of skulls.The terrible sadness of the film is to be found in a rather extraordinary late scene in which Ba reveals something awful to Hoa, who then immediately has to deal with a customer, an interruption to be compared with the one at the end of Brief Encounter. Viet and Nam is a film that first feels opaque and elusive, and yet it becomes drenched with emotion.Viet and Nam is at the ICA, London, from 8 August and is available to stream on SBS On Demand in Australia.Explore more on these topicsWorld cinemaDrama filmsVietnamRomance filmsAsia PacificVietnam warreviewsShareReuse this content"

But for all that this film shows an arguably refreshing and perhaps even radical refusal to problematise the central relationship, it looks pretty shallow in comparison.Elias (Lou Goossens) is a teen boy in ruralBelgium, notionally going out with Valerie (Saar Rogiers), a girl at his school. His grandpa is a farmer nearby, his dad a composer of cheesy but successful pop songs. Elias is quietly stunned when a good-looking boy of his age moves in next door, just arrived from Brussels; this is Alexander (Marius De Saeger). They become friends; Alexander is perfectly calm and candid about being gay and then they become more than friends. They have to deal with homophobic bullying at school and Elias’s discarded girlfriend has to handle her own feelings of anger and rejection.The drama sorts itself out neatly before the closing credits and the older generation on both sides seem to be very enlightened, which is surprising, if admirable, in the case of Elias’s rural farmer grandpa. In the end there is something a little too smooth and passionless in the film – there is nothing, for example to match or even approach the great speech from Michael Stuhlbarg’s caring father to Timothée Chalamet’s heartbroken Elio in Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name. Everyone knows that young love, gay and straight, is (mostly) about heartbreak and about moving on. I’m not sure that this film really understands that.Young Hearts is in UK cinemas from 8 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsLGBTQ+ rightsBelgiumEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

The delay clearly hasn’t put off the throngs of devoted Lambs (Carey’s stans), displaying their fandom with T-shirts referencing other quotes from the diva such as “I don’t know her” and “I don’t have time for the rigmarole”.Carey appears wearing a trans flag-inspired pink, blue and white minidress and a leather jacket embroidered with the slogan “Protect the Dolls”. The opening is relentless as she storms through snippets of Type Dangerous, Emotions, Make It Happen, I’ll Be There, Vision of Love and Dreamlover. While her voice is not as pristine as it once was, her whistle register is still intact and thrills the crowd every time.After that promising start, the show falters with a setlist that hurries Carey – and the crowd – through some of her biggest hits. Fantasy is sloppy and rushed, with only one verse and chorus (plus the Ol’ Dirty Bastard rap, piped in), while a Heartbreaker/Honey mashup is similarly cut short. The crowd are eager to carry her, but even with knowing every word they struggle to keep up with the stop-start pacing.After an outfit change, covered by the first of many drum fills and dance breaks, Carey returns for #Beautiful, her 2013 duet with Miguel, which she rarely performs, exciting those fans (and there seem to be many) who have been tracking her recent setlists. She follows it up with a swaggering rendition of Obsessed – widely understood as her diss track of Eminem – and a playful Touch My Body, which marks the show hitting its peak.The best way to age? Forget the longevity bros – and be more Mariah CareyRead moreA glam moment during Say Somethin’, where the singer’s hair and makeup team come on stage mid-performance to do touchups, is as camp and silly as you’d expect from a diva such as Carey. But after another leisurely outfit change (into the next of a series of sparkly minidresses), the interludes really start to drag, and people begin to drift away. There’s no number of energetic shirtless male dancers who can keep the crowd entertained while Carey is frequently off stage and then, when she returns, increasingly going through the motions.It’s a shame, as the closing numbers feature four of Carey’s best songs from 2005’s The Emancipation of Mimi, including We Belong Together and Fly Like a Bird, but by this point many have lost interest or legged it for the train home. To anyone who thought Brighton Pride would be too small a stage for her to bring her best, Carey proved that she’s still got it, but she could have probably given a little more.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMariah Careylive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Now, of course, conductor Robin Ticciati reverts to Janáček’s original score. I didn’t see Michieletto’s original, however, and so cannot tell how much may have changed dramatically.An inconsistent staging, it transforms an essentially naturalistic work into a symbolist exploration of its heroine’s mind, and an opera essentially about the darkness of the human soul, is now reimagined in antiseptic, clinical white. There’s little suggestion of the natural world that mirrors the central crisis, only a phosphorescent glare seen between the cracks of the white walls that hem Kateřina Kněžíková’s Káťa in. Michieletto is unsparing in his depiction of Kabanicha’s (Susan Bickley) abuse, yet at the same time, the social background is curiously vague here, and we lose sight of Káťa’s tragedy as emblematic of conflicts between reactionary authoritarianism and emerging liberalism.View image in fullscreenInner conflict … Kateřina Kněžíková (Káťa) in Káťa Kabanová at Glyndebourne, July 2025.Photograph: Marc Brenner/Glyndebourne ProductionsInstead, Michieletto realises her dreams and fantasies. She imagines flying free like a bird, though bird cages, proliferating on stage, only serve to enhance her growing sense of entrapment. The angel she dreamt of in church as a child, now stalks her adult imagination, wounded, its wings bloodied. This ambivalent figure, male and stripped to the waist in 2021, has now become female androgynous and Byzantine, though the image is overused. Its feathers flutter down as Kněžíková yields to Nicky Spence’s Boris, though Michieletto ruins the subsequent love scene by bringing Bickley on stage to pluck the angel’s wings and immure it in a cage, a horrendous distraction. Michieletto doesn’t always trust the score: in Act I, the exquisite passage intended to mark Káťa’s first appearance now accompanies furtive groping between Sam Furness’s Kudrjáš and Rachael Wilson’s Varvara, leaving Kněžíková to slope on a few minutes later, though we have already seen her during the prelude.Much of it sounds extremely fine, however, though Ticciati, conducting the London Philharmonic, is perhaps stronger on the score’s lyricism than its incipient violence: the close of Act I, and indeed the climactic storm that unhinges Káťa’s mind, could have been more tense than they were on opening night. Kněžíková is really lovely in the title role, her tone silvery yet warm, her dynamic control immaculate, vivid in her delineation of Káťa’s inner conflict. Spence sounds wonderfully ardent, but by the end we are also painfully aware of Boris’s essential cowardice and weakness of will. Bickley, tremendous here, gives us her most terrifying Kabanicha yet. Furness and Wilson, meanwhile, are just delightful as the couple who manage to escape the nightmare that surrounds them. A flawed production, but finely sung.In repertory until 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGlyndebourneLeoš JanáčekLondon Philharmonic OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

But sometimes they overlap. Discovery doesn’t dawn only from new poets and collections. Dusting off work I’m supposedly familiar with can suddenly reveal new perspectives, especially with a good editor as guide.Last week I re-readJohn Masefieldas the result of a conversation with a writer-friend who gives readings to groups of adult-newcomers to poetry, often bringing well-known hits into his playlist. We soon got into a conversation about John Masefield’s Sea-Fever (tried, tested but, we agreed, far from tired) and he raised a question about the first line: should it be “I must go down to the seas again” or “I must down to the seas again”? I wasn’t sure; he wasn’t sure.I checked in at home with the almost eponymous Sea-Fever: Selected Poems, edited by Philip W Errington, published in 2023. Errington has re-printed the poem as it appeared in Masefield’s first collection, Salt Water Ballads, 1902, where the word “go” is also omitted.The “saltiness” in these early poems is often supplied by the mariners’ dialect as they discuss death at sea, whether by shipwreck or as the result of yellow fever. When Masefield’s poetic persona is close to himself, any lingering saline trace of dialect is washed by an inflowing fresh water tide of romantic longing. The sea is an image of seemingly free movement, and poems like The West Wind and Sea-Fever itself convey that double-expanse: the ever-moving sea and wind, and the human freedom these elements can symbolise.Less specific than some of the poems about the technicalities of sailing, Sea-Fever is a picture made of verbs, assonance, and the conjunction “and”, woven into the rhythmic strokes of a seven-beat line that joins what would be two lines in a traditional ballad. In each of the Sea-Fever quatrains, two couplets share a shanty-like call-and-response. The first ends firmly on the final stress (“sky”, “by”/ “tide, “denied”/ “life”, “knife”) while the second revises the rhythmic emphasis with feminine endings (“shaking”, “breaking”/ “flying”, “crying”/ “fellow-rover”, “over”). Herring-gulls are constantly “crying” in that long “i” sound. But a word with a short “i” (“trick”) is the clinching effect in the last line: as so often, the voyage concludes with death, but the characterisation of life as “the long trick” is what stands out, suddenly intruding on those cliches of “quiet sleep” and “sweet dream” with an unforeseeable adjective-noun combination: “And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick’s over.”But what of that first line, and the word “go” – added for the first time in Ballads and Poems,1910, present in the 1922 Selected Poems, lacking in the 1923 Collected Poems, but back in place in the revised Collected Poems in 1946?Errington quotes from Linda Hart’s A First Line Mystery published in The Journal of the John Masefield Society in 1993: “When asked, in 1927, about the first line of the poem, Masefield stated ‘… I notice that in the early edition, 1902, I print the line “I must down”. That was as I wrote the line in the first instance … When I am reciting the poem I usually insert the word “go”. When the poem is spoken I feel the need of the word but in print “go” is unnecessary and looks ill.’”From Masefield’s comments, it seems he found “I must down to the seas again” unnatural to speak, but that he preferred it to the less jinglingly dactylic rhythm that “go” created on the page. “I must down” is literary, antiquated diction for 1902. The omission of the preposition has distinguished idiomatic ancestry, though. There’s a similar turn of phrase from Shakespeare in King Lear, when Lear says to Cordelia: “Come, let’s away to prison …”The noticeable jolt in Sea-Fever from the reference to “the vagrant gypsy life” is explained in another illuminating editorial note. In manuscript drafts the poem begins, sea-less, “I must go down to the roads again” or “I must out on the roads again”. Those discarded “roads” might have led Masefield to the kenning-like “gull’s way” and “whale’s way”. Perhaps the freedom of the sea and that of the open road and the community of the travellers remained joined together in Masefield’s imagination.By omitting the all-too-necessary “roads”, the Wolverhampton-based poet of the new 20th century expresses the hallucinatory quality of his longing for what had been a mixed blessing at the time, the life of a sailor. His first impulse, to avoid the pedestrian “go down”, is the right one. He is murmuring to himself as if in a fever-dream: “I must down to the seas again …”Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekJohn MasefieldfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Words spill out of Pepys – 1.25m of them – as he bustles around London, building a successful career as a naval administrator while navigating the double trauma of the plague and the Great Fire of London. Historians have long gone to the diary for details of middle-class life during the mid‑17th century: the seamy streets, the watermen, the taverns and, as Pepys moves up the greasy pole, the court and the king. Best of all is his eye for the picturesque detail: the way, for instance, on the morning of 4 September 1666, as fire licks around his house, Pepys buries a choice parmesan cheese in the garden with the intention of keeping it safe.Not all of the diary is in English, though. Quite a lot of it is in French (or rather Franglais), Latin, Spanish and a curious mashup of all three. Pepys increasingly resorted to this home-brewed polyglot whenever the subject of sex came up, which was often. Indeed, sex – chasing it, having it, worrying about getting it again – dominated Pepys’s waking life and haunted his dreams, many of them nightmares. Putting these anguished passages in a garbled form not only lessened the chance of servants snooping, but also served to protect him from his own abiding sense of shame. As an extra layer of concealment, Pepys wrote “my Journall” using tachygraphy, an early form of shorthand.Pepys’s diaries were published in bowdlerised form in the 19th century, and it was not until the 1970s that they became available in 11 unexpurgated volumes. Even then, explains Guy de la Bédoyère, there were many transcription errors and, crucially, no attempt was made to translate the coded passages into English. Historians knew about them, of course, not least because all you needed was a bit of classroom French and Latin to work out their meaning. On 25 March 1668, Pepys records that he has given “Mrs Daniels” eight pairs of gloves “for tocar my prick con her hand”, which is hardly likely to keep anyone guessing for very long.While Pepys’s dark side has long been known, it is something else to be confronted with the evidence laid out quite so starklyAll the same, it has been easy to lose sight of the sexual thread of Pepys’s diary amid all the chatter about navy ships and expensive cheese. Which is why, for the first time, De la Bédoyère has gone back to the original manuscript and translated all of Pepys’s coded entries, publishing them end-to-end with only a minimum of contextual information. The result is an extraordinarily detailed snapshot of life seen through the eyes of a man for whom no day was complete unless he had managed to fondle at least one woman’s “mameles” (breasts) on his way to or from work.In the past, people have blamed Pepys’s bad behaviour on the Restoration. These were the years when the dour pieties of Oliver Cromwell had been replaced by Charles II’s permissive libertarianism. But there is much more – and much worse – to the occluded parts of Pepys’s diary than mere bawdiness. On 3 February 1664, for example, he is travelling in a carriage down Ludgate Hill when he witnesses three men raping a woman and wishes he could join in. On 1 December 1660, he beats his maid Jane savagely with a broom, though it is clear that he is eyeing her up for a future assignation. He often uses the words “towsing” and “tumbling” to describe what he is doing with women which sounds jolly and bucolic until De la Bédoyère explains that these terms are euphemisms for violence.The only occasion on which Pepys might hold back was if he knew a woman was single, which would make any pregnancy impossible to explain away. (It was a mercy that he didn’t realise that an earlier operation for a bladder stone had probably left him sterile.) For that reason, he badgered any girl he wanted to sleep with regularly to get married, so he could carry on regardless. As news of his behaviour got around, so others would try to exploit it. On 11 August 1665, an old waterman called Delkes presented Pepys with his daughter-in-law, who was willing to sleep with him in return for a guarantee that her husband would not be pressed into naval service.And then there was his marriage. Pepys had wed Elizabeth when she was just 14. He was proud of her beauty, congratulating himself on how much prettier she was than the many grand ladies at court whom he encountered on his way to becoming secretary to the navy. Everything else about her frustrated him. He grumbled about her untidiness, extravagance, moodiness and the fact that her heavy periods and a recurrent labial abscess meant that she often wasn’t available for sex. Most of all, he resented the way that she had taken to hiring plain maidservants in the hope that he would leave them alone (it didn’t work). Inevitably he took out his frustrations with his fists: on 19 December 1664 he gave Elizabeth such a black eye that she was unable to go to church on Christmas Day for fear of what the neighbours would think.While Pepys’s dark side has long been known, it is something else to be confronted with the evidence laid out quite so starkly. The man who emerges from De la Bédoyère’s meticulous filleting is no Restoration roustabout but a chilling embodiment of male entitlement. This newly explicit view of Pepys does not negate the continuing value of his diary – which remains a magnificent historical resource – but from now on it will be impossible to go to it in a state of innocence, let alone denial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It gives us a promising flavour of the voice with whom we’ll be spending the next 340 pages.The story begins with deceptive simplicity: “Once upon a time, I had seven dads in seven years. This is the story of those years.” The narrative has a section for each “dad”, charting Andrev’s tumultuous childhood and teens as his mother’s boyfriends come and go, all of them disappointing and disruptive, and several of them violent. The dads are named for their dominant trait in young Andrev’s eyes: so we get the Plant Magician, the Thief, the Murderer, the Artist, among others.It is billed as a novel but we’re in ambiguous territory here. The story is heavily autobiographical, based on Walden’s own childhood experiences. The narrator tells us: “If anything sounds made up, then you can be sure that it is true.” Instead, the inventions are “tucked away in the most mundane parts – like the colour of a cushion”. So we have two Andrevs involved, the child whose bewildered, coming-of-age adventures we follow, and the “real” Andrev, whose name is on the front cover. Metafictional interjections pepper the narrative, the authorial voice frequently intruding to comment on its own decisions, such as Andrev’s observation on the very first page: “I shouldn’t start there. (I have most assuredly already done so, but I think the attempt should remain, given its aptness as a bridge to a dramaturgical arc.)” These postmodern flourishes could have felt grating, but the narrative voice has more than enough wit and charm to carry them off.Walden’s instinct for observation and his ear for prose are flawless – his understated humour is particularly winningIt’s easy to see why the book has been such a hit in Walden’s native Sweden, where it was the bestseller of 2023 across all genres and won the August prize, Sweden’s most prestigious literary award. Walden’s instinct for observation and his ear for prose are flawless. His understated humour is particularly winning. Going to stay with relatives, Andrev is amazed by the number of cousins in the house: “There are so many rooms and so many cousins that I keep finding new ones. It’s like opening doors on an Advent calendar – wow, here’s another cousin.” And then, a few pages later: “When we return to the apartment on Tomtebogatan, new cousins have emerged from the walls.” (He hasn’t yet realised that his aunt is a childminder.)But for all its humour, there is a terrible bleakness at the novel’s core. The men are, almost without exception, selfish, violent, dishonest or cruel; sometimes all of these at once. It is characteristic of Walden’s restraint that one of the most chilling moments in the novel is barely more than an aside, a reference to the friend of Andrev’s mother, Little Cloud, whose ex-boyfriend turned up at her door one night: “He didn’t want to talk. He didn’t even want to come in. All he wanted was to hit her on the head with the hammer and that he did, wordlessly. That’s how she got the hole in her head and learned to hate men.” The childish offhandness with which this moment is treated makes it all the more disturbing.Of all the dads, the brilliantly drawn Plant Magician looms largest in the narrative. Some of the others have a tendency to blur into one another (the book might also have been called Bloody Awful in Pretty Similar Ways). But it’s not really about the dads anyway. It’s about Andrev, and, to a lesser extent, his vulnerable and resilient mother.Beyond the structural device of the seven dads, Walden resists any easy narrative hooks; Andrev warns us not to “harbour expectations of an unexpected twist – this story lacks such inclinations”. Instead, Walden trusts to the precision and flair of his writing alone, and for the most part this decision is vindicated. It is true that the momentum dissipates somewhat in the final third (I could probably have done with one or two fewer dads, but since we’re in the realm of semifictionalised memoir, this is a bit much to ask). However, the writing remains so sharp, so beguiling, so acutely observed that by this point I was willing to follow Andrev/Andrev pretty much anywhere.Rebecca Wait’sHavocis published by Riverrun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

A runaway train is hurtling towards five people tied to the tracks. You can pull a lever to divert the train to a different track to which only one person is tied. Do you intervene to kill the one and spare the five?What if one of the tracks twisted into a really cool loop-the-loop? Or the trolley was replaced by a bloodthirsty Thomas the Tank Engine? Or the whole dilemma was clumsily altered to comment on the political controversy of the day? Originally formulated as a reflection on moral decision-making, the trolley problem found a second life in the 2010s as a well of inspiration for variously silly, irreverent and self-referential trolley-based memes. Now, it may be entering its third era as surreal interactive comedy game The Trolley Solution.Each level plays as a minigame tenuously shaped around the thought experiment. There’s always a trolley, a lever and a pseudo-ethical dilemma, plus a twist to throw everything off the rails. The track is dissected into puzzle pieces that you must reassemble against the clock. A commuter next to the rails needs help remaining emotionally stable by balancing the blasts of serotonin they receive from scrolling social media. One level spirals into a short visual novel about a Japanese girl falling in love with a tram that threatens to murder her high school rival.View image in fullscreenIdeally suited to the era of social media … The Trolley Solution.Photograph: byDanDansIt is, obviously, all very silly, and sees in the trolley problem the same absurdity as the memes. “It’s a serious matter presented in a kind of ridiculous way,” says solo Chilean developer byDanDans. Or, as he puts it in terms of a Reddit thread: “It’s free real estate for shit-posting.”With the basic gag already well worn, byDanDans focused on iterating the dilemma into quirkier scenarios and experimenting broadly with the minigames, before nailing down the final selection. “Some iterations were too bland, too unfunny,” he says. “Or I just couldn’t think of a minigame that followed the four rules I set for myself.” Those rules being that each minigame needed to be fun, connected to the dilemma that unlocks it, do something that hasn’t been seen before, and subvert expectations.Even so, if all this sounds a bit gimmicky that’s largely because it is. The trolley solution may be best thought of as an extended interactive sketch show based around a single joke. But it’s a joke with enough charm and a quick enough punchline (each minigame lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, and the level select screen hints at a concise total run time) that it shouldn’t become stale.In many ways, it’s also ideally suited to the era of social media. The humour is internet-coded and the bite-size minigames are a perfect fit for quickfire TikToks pitched to video game laymen. “I did try to make something easy to pick up and finish,” says byDanDans. “My previous games were too technical and too hardcore for most players. I tried to make something anyone could enjoy.”Enjoy is a slightly weird word to use in the context of an ethical dilemma. If byDanDans were faced with the original trolley problem, what would he do? “I’d have to go with the option that leads to fewer legal repercussions,” he says. “I’d call the cops, scream for help, and try to untie or push them off the tracks.” So he’d ignore the parameters of the thought experiment and concoct a far-fetched scheme for added excitement?

Set amid a family reunion dinner in Northern Ireland, only the women are present here. And in the way of many such theatrical reunions, it leads to an almighty blow-up, yet there is no hint of cliche. Kelly is a talented playwright navigating between black humour and pain.At the head of the table is Eileen (Julia Dearden), a foul-mouthed matriarch whose 90thbirthday they are celebrating. Gilly (Andrea Irvine) is her daughter and the mother of Jenny (Caoimhe Farren), who left long ago for a life in London. Muireann (Muireann Ní Fhaogáin), the youngest, is Jenny’s London-born-and-raised daughter.Slickly directed by Katie Posner, it is horribly, humorously, gripping: reminiscent ofBeth Steel’s Till the Stars Come Downat its best, with flecks of Martin McDonagh’s mother-daughter drama The Beauty Queen of Leenane. Daughters cyclically blame their mothers for the pain and harm they’ve inherited, while letting their fathers off the hook.View image in fullscreenGhosts at the table … (from left) Muireann Ní Fhaogáin, Andrea Irvine, Julia Dearden and Caoimhe Farren in Consumed.Photograph: Pamela RaithEileen appears, at first, like a cartoonishly drawn battleaxe, but she is perhaps best at hiding vulnerability. Gilly has comical spurts of rage despite her cultivated, singalong calmness. Jenny is full of blame towards her, pointing out maternal shortcomings like a stroppy teen, and is superbly played by Farren. Muireann is the flattest character, satirised for her gen Z talk of gluten and environmental harm. She has an eating disorder but it is too briefly broached and appears to fit the greater scheme of a play in which each woman is grappling with suppressed trauma, passed down and ingested as their own.The play travels from dining table realism to the baroque. The rumbles in Beth Duke’s sound design foreshadow this turn into lyrical and symbolic new ground. Talk of Northern Ireland’s past peppered the early scenes but it now becomes clear that this cross-generational family represents a bigger history of violence. The play’s shape-shifting is part of its audaciousness, but this late turn is brief and leaves much hanging.It is a lot to grapple with in 70 minutes and you feel as if Consumed could be developed into a bigger play at a longer length, or streamlined for this shorter one. Either way, its potential is clear.At theTraverse theatre, Edinburgh, until 24 August.

More than 60 years after her death, the blond mop, the wafting white dress and that wiggle of a walk continue to inspire imitators.EastEnders actor Michelle Collins, making her fringe debut, once came across such an acolyte in LA and was fascinated. The woman, in her 60s, pulled up in a motorhome and emerged looking just like the star ofSome Like It Hot. What need for fame, what thirst for attention, what emotional hunger could drive such a person?The encounter stayed with her and, with playwright Ben Weatherill picking up where her late friendStewart Permuttleft off, she now plays Denise, a girl from Southend who has wound up in the US as a 61-year-old Monroe lookalike, hustling for loose change as a street entertainer by a convenient air vent.In front of an adoring audience, Collins plays Denise with a mixture of the hard-bitten and the gullible. Under the direction of Alexandra Spencer-Jones, she also does a suitably breathy and sweet-voiced rendition of River of No Return, suggesting that with the right breaks, this copycat performer could have done all right for herself.View image in fullscreenFandom … Collins in Motorhome Marilyn.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFor no obvious reason, Denise has chosen to tell her life story to her pet snake. And what a dismal tale it is. The script is a litany of letdowns, exploitation, unwanted pregnancy, dead-end gigs, spiced up with one unlikely melodramatic twist. It aspires to be tragic but comes across as plain miserable.It would be one thing if these were the backstage anecdotes of a real actor, quite another for them to be fictional. Why spend time with such a lost and deluded person? My performance was interrupted moments before the fiery denouement by someone falling ill, but it would take more than a dramatic ending to elevate such a dreary play.At theGilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 25 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedyMarilyn MonroeEdinburgh festivalFestivalsEastEndersreviewsShareReuse this content"

Because the boys are Palestinian, and the horse is stationed at a roundabout in Jenin in the West Bank, this is not only a coming-of-age drama but also a look at the brutality of the Israeli occupation, endured by Palestinian civilians over many decades.In this case, the civilians are best friends growing up amid the rubble of repeated invasions, learning to play alongside it. The story begins long before 7 October 2023, although it finishes here, when the model horse is ripped down and destroyed by an Israeli tank.In tone, it is bouncy, droll and warm. Underneath it buzzes with suppressed suffering and fear, but also resilience. Writer and comedian Alaa Shehada begins in standup mode, cracking jokes, engaging the audience: “My name is Alaa, not Allah.”It is clear this will not be a sombre lesson on the Middle East conflict. Shehada now lives in Amsterdam but takes us back to a rambunctious childhood in Jenin, moving through the decades in picaresque strides, from his inseparable friendship with Ahmed, who is born on the same day as him, to school days, a disastrous romance, and the grandfather who gives him a small model horse. It is, he tells us, a symbol of freedom and, years later, a German artist comes to the West Bank to build a five-metre horse out of the rubble of the 2002 Israeli invasion, after the second intifada.View image in fullscreenExuberant … Alaa Shehada in The Horse of Jenin.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIn the foreground are Shehada’s exuberant tales of the 1990s and 00s. In the backdrop hover soldiers with automatic firearms at checkpoints, tanks flattening homes, rockets firing at ambulances, killing celebrated doctors. The parallels from then to now are appalling in their never-ending violent circularity.Artfully directed by Katrien van Beurden and Thomas van Ouwerkerk, the production is one of a number of Palestinian stories at this year’s fringe includingMy Name Is Rachel Corrie,NowhereandBalfour Reparations. Shehada is very funny and full of energy, mixing English with Arabic, using commedia dell’arte masks and mime in funny and haunting ways, taking wry snipes at western media searches for tragic stories in the region. It builds to a gut-punch, although there is no self-pity or sentimentality. This is a production that chooses to find joy amid horror.Alaa’s friendship with Ahmed, in its innocence and loss, is deeply moving.And how can anyone fail to feel the resonance of this amid reports – rejected by the IDF – that the Israeli army is shooting at children?All that is left, in such abject circumstances, is storytelling – and Shehada knows it power.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburghuntil 25 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatreComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

On a night out, she is all fluttering eyelashes and enormous gold platforms. She is not the picture of your average Cambridge undergraduate. Which is exactly the point of this tremendous solo show in whichJade Franks– remember the name – skewers the institution of class privilege in a performance that is as funny as it is politically stinging.She writes from experience. A child of working-class Liverpool (her parents are in the front row at my performance, adding to the backchatting merriment), Franks is employed at a call centre when inspiration strikes. She was always good at school and full of ambition – why shouldn’t she apply to Oxbridge?It is a mere detail that she has to work out where Oxbridge is. She is not easily deterred.One outreach programme later, she is on her way south, moving to Cambridge early to get set up with a cleaning job. What follows in Tatenda Shamiso’s razor-sharp production is a culture-clash comedy in the tradition of Pygmalion and Educating Rita (what I’d give to see Franks star in Willy Russell’s play).Edinburgh fringe 2025: the best theatre and comedy we’ve already reviewedRead moreHer deadpan wit sustains the performance, jokes lining up with jokes by the line, but what drives it all is deep rage. Yes, there are the gags about men who wear jumpers over their shoulders, the arcane hierarchy of schools and the endless skiing holidays. But for all the absurdity of ruling-class behaviour, it is not funny to be sniggered at, patronised and demeaned, to have to make a secret of earning a wage and to hear your accent being parroted back to you.More than that, some of the students she meets, blind to their privilege, revelling in their ignorance, will go on to be politicians, even prime ministers, making decisions about people of whom they know little and could care less. In that, Eat the Rich drills deeper than just one woman’s story of exclusion. Rather, it is a damning portrait of a dysfunctional social order.Change is long overdue, but at least with Franks leading the rallying cry, this revolution will be a right good laugh.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalTheatreUniversitiesHigher educationreviewsShareReuse this content"

I had limited time before my daughter went back to school and having that deadline was a very good thing.I’d always liked ghost stories – MR James and so on – but they were always short. Many are unsatisfactory because they have a buildup, then scramble to an end, and that’s it. I thought there ought to be more than that. But it is hard to sustain tension and fear over a longer book. You can’t just have somebody being terrified every chapter.I made a list of the essential ingredients, beginning with a ghost. I remember writing down “weather”: I loved reading ghost stories that began in foggy conditions. The setting then had to be isolated, a place where nobody would talk about this thing – a conspiracy of silence.I always write by hand. The medical student said: “My sister’s doing a typing course and is looking for things to type.” I sent her the first few chapters but she came back saying her sister couldn’t read my handwriting. She suggested a Dictaphone so I bought a cheapo recorder and read into that. Then she came back and said: “My sister says it’s going to be a bit slow because she is too frightened to do it when she is alone in the house.”Inner-city boys have a look on their faces that says: 'Go on – frighten me.' In 10 minutes, they’re clutching each otherThat sister was Jane Tranter, who went on to be controller of drama commissioning at the BBC. She still remembers it. She said: “I could not listen to it because your voice got very sinister when it was reading certain bits.”The book was published in 1983 and the play opened four years later in Scarborough, where I was born and brought up. The adaptation complemented the book: in a small theatre, it’s like you are the reader alone in the house. I’ve occasionally sat at the back of the theatre at a matinee and watched these inner-London boys of 16 with a look on their faces that says: “Go on then – frighten me.” It takes about 10 minutes and then they all start clutching each other. They change completely.View image in fullscreen‘My voice got very sinister in certain bits’ … writer Susan Hill.Photograph: David Crump/Daily Mail/ShutterstockRobin Herford, directorIn the late summer of 1987, I was working at the Stephen Joseph theatre in Scarborough while Alan Ayckbourn was away at the National. I got to the end of my second year and found I had £5,000 of the budget left. I thought I’d do an extra show over Christmas and figured a ghost story might be a good idea. We had enough money for four actors and we could do it in the bar, where you can get 70 seats in.Stephen Mallatratt, the resident playwright, wasn’t terribly impressed by my idea but he came back a few days later and said: “Have you read The Woman in Black?” I’m a wimp as far as horror is concerned, but this was a human story about a woman who was forced to give up her baby. I was blown away by it, but it had 15 characters. “You haven’t been listening, Stephen!” I told him.He said: “I’ve had an idea about that. I might even be able to give you some change.”He proceeded to write an adaptation for three actors: Jon Strickland, Dominic Letts and Lesley Meade. The designer, Michael Holt, came up with the idea of using gauze: if you light it from one side you can’t see through it, but from the other, it’s transparent. It gave us one of the first rough-magic tools. It’s embarrassingly simple. You can do an extraordinary amount with very little. I commandeered the bar’s kitchens for my five Revox reel-to-reel tape machines, so we could do the sound without hearing “clunk, click”.If I’d had a decent budget, I could have done a super production – but it wouldn’t have engaged the imaginationWe sold out almost immediately. I put in extra midnight performances and there was quite a buzz about it. It’s rare to really frighten a theatre audience, so it surprised us in Scarborough when people said: “I didn’t sleep for three nights after seeing your show.”A year to the day after opening in Scarborough, we had the read-through for the first London production, which opened at the Lyric Hammersmith in January 1989. Had I had a decent budget, instead of mopping up £5,000’s worth of local authority grant, I could have done a super production, but it wouldn’t have engaged the imagination and wouldn’t have run atthe Fortune theatre in London for 33 years. Since then, it has starred actors including Frank Finlay, Edward Petherbridge, Joseph Fiennes and Martin Freeman and I’ve seen tough rugby-playing men cowering amid the screams in the auditorium.The Woman in Blackis touringfrom 24 September to 18 April, beginning at Storyhouse, ChesterExplore more on these topicsTheatreHow we madeStephen Joseph theatreHorror booksSusan HillFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its hero is a bedraggled hermit named Robin (Nicolas Cage) who lives in the woods with his pet pig. Robin is kind of a tough hang – a sullen misanthrope who just barely tolerates the occasional presence of Amir (Alex Wolff), the young businessman who buys truffles from him. We don’t know who Robin was before, but it’s clear that life has taken a lot from him already. And then someone steals his damn pig.‘Always provided a release’: why Aliens is my feelgood movieRead moreHe sets off to rescue her and soon finds himself drawn into the grubby underbelly of Portland’s culinary scene, where chefs and waiters take part in bare-knuckled fights. We learn that Robin himself was once an esteemed chef and, called back into his old world on a quest for vengeance, it briefly looks like Pig is setting him up to be a scruffy John Wick. But, for Robin, revenge is a dish best served with the utmost care.Rather than violent showdowns we get a series of gentle sit-downs. First, he and Amir breakfast on some poorly cooked French toast. Amir tells Robin about his struggles growing up with a domineering father and a mentally ill mother. Robin responds by reminding him that the entire city of Portland is sure to be obliterated by earthquakes soon, so his personal problems really aren’t that big a deal. “You don’t have to care,” Robin assures him.It would be easy to mistake that advice for nihilism, to interpret it as encouragement to swear off humanity the way Robin has. Because he’s not wrong – even if you avoid the floods, everything you love in life will be washed away eventually. So maybe it’s better not to care.But that doesn’t quite jive with the rest of the movie. Setting aside the extremely upsetting pig-napping scene, Sarnoski’s film is crafted with an unmistakable gentleness. The woodland where it begins is captured in long, patient takes that highlight the delicate play of light and water. Later, a home cooking scene is lit with such a gorgeous amber glow that it feels like a childhood memory. Each image is arranged with the care of a master chef assembling elements on a plate, and the yearning score from Alexis Grapsas and Philip Klein complements it beautifully.In short, this is not a film that’s going to tell us not to care. In fact, it’s the very opposite.Robin and Amir follow their breakfast with lunch at a hot new restaurant where plates of foam and smoke are accompanied by impassioned spiels about “the story” each dish tells. Robin summons the head chef and quickly drives him into an existential crisis by asking him simply, kindly, if he actually likes cooking this stuff. Maintaining the monk-like stillness that he carries throughout the film, Robin asks the increasingly frantic chef why he’s letting critics who don’t matter and customers who’ll never think about him again dictate the direction of his life. “We don’t get a lot of things to really care about,” Robin says.What’s beautiful about Pig – beyond the tranquil music, soul-soothing photography, offbeat humour and Cage’s meditative performance – is that it’s a movie about the importance of choosing to care. There’s a reason the film closes with a cover of Springsteen’s I’m On Fire, where love is described in terms of knife wounds and flames. Yes, caring will open us up to failure and pain. Robin himself is a walking embodiment of all the damage that caring can do to a person. But, over the course of the movie, we see him being slowly brought back to life – first by his fierce desire to protect the one creature he still allows himself to love, and then in a growing ability to care about other people too.There are plenty of movies that provide a more conventional “feelgood” role in my life. Ponyo paints the screen with pure joy. Airplane! is a barrage of beautifully braindead humour. When Harry Met Sally fits like a wool sweater and Lord of the Rings sweeps you up into a bucolic fantasy world where good always prevails. But I love Pig because it acknowledges all the reasons there are to feel absolutely terrible and then doubles down on the reasons to feel good anyway.We don’t get a lot of things to really care about, but the list surely includes nice food, good company, and movies like this.Pig is available on Netflix in the US, UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieNicolas CageDrama filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianEastern Ukraine’s biggest city is unsettlingly close to the Russian border and vulnerable to missile strikes, but there is a determination to maintain a cultural life, and a poetry festival is testament to the resilience and creativity of its peopleByCharlotte Higginsin Kharkiv; photographs byJulia KochetovaMon 4 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 05.27 EDTShareThe city of Kharkiv, just 18 miles from the Russian border, is a paradoxical mix of tended-to and broken. Public sculptures are wrapped and coddled in sandbags to protect them from missiles. Flowerbeds in parks are punctiliously maintained. The life of the streets is several notches quieter than you would expect from a European country’s second city – and yet, bookshops, coffee shops and restaurants are open and doing a steady business.But the signs of Russia’s unrelenting attacks on this frontline city are omnipresent. On the roads are rows of rusted lines of the spiky metal tank obstacles known as “hedgehogs”. The magnificent 1920s Derzhprom building, a constructivist masterpiece and the architectural pride of the city, is nowbadly battered.Across the city, windows, blown out from buildings by nightly explosions, have been replaced by sheets of chipboard. One panel in the city centre has been pasted over with a paper cutout of two enfolding arms and the words, “I love you, beloved Kharkiv.”Two images side by side: left is Serhii Zhadan, a Ukrainian poet and writer; right is a view over Kharkiv, very dark clouds in the foreground, lighter sky in the distanceSerhii Zhadan, a Ukrainian poet and writer who is now serving in the Khartiia brigade. Right, the view over the city from Karazin Kharkiv National UniversityCultural life clings on. But it has largely burrowed below ground: the basements of theatres are now theirmain stages; bookshops’event venuesare subterranean. One Kharkiv visual artist,Kostiantyn Zorkin, has created an apt metaphor for the atmosphere of this underground world. A series of his works imagines wartime Kharkiv as a ship alone in stormy seas, its inhabitants huddled, in relative safety, in the vessel’s hold.The city’s population now consists of those who have moved here from places even more dangerous; and those who have stayed in their own city either because they must, or from a refusal to let Kharkiv’s urban life die.Such resolve to stay involves a having made a personal accommodation with the proximity of death. Air defences in Kharkiv are few, and Russia is near. By the time the air-raid alarm sounds, often the missiles are already falling.Two images side by side: left, a man sitting  with an open book on his knees, shot from the neck down; right, some windows of the Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city centre protected with chipboard.Serhii Zhadan reads from Yuliia Paievska’s debut book of poetry at the Meridian Kharkiv festival. Her call-sign is ‘Taira’ and she also serves in the Khartiia brigade. Right, boarded up windows in the Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city centreUnder these circumstances, something as intimate and emotionally charged as a poetry festival – such as the recent two-day event in a below-ground venue in the city centre – takes on a significance and intensity unimaginable in peacetime.When Kharkiv’s most celebrated poet, novelist and musician Serhii Zhadan performs his own poems, some rapt audience members mouth along, clearly knowing the verses by heart.“There are more than a million people in Kharkiv,” says Zhadan, now serving with the local Khartiia brigade, between readings. “They have cultural needs. The festival is important from a psychological point of view: they see that they are not alone, that they have not been abandoned, that there are many people around them who share their values, are on the same wavelength.”View image in fullscreenPoet Yuliia Paievska on stage at the festivalThe festival, organised by publisher Meridian Czernowitz, is the first of its kind in Kharkiv, though the publishing house has conducted events in southern frontline cities such as Odesa, Mykolaiv and Kherson since 2023.“People from frontline cities can go to a shelter and feel safe and listen to poetry – and while they are doing that, they are not sitting at home listening to drones or reading Facebook,” says organiser Evgenia Lopata.People are searching for Ukrainian identity … and people want Ukrainian literature to readEvgenia Lopata“Being here means being part of a community that is supporting each other,” she says. It is partly a case of people connecting to fellow Ukrainian speakers in a city that for years has been mainly Russophone, Lopata adds. Though many inhabitants, particularly in the city’s creative community, have shifted to Ukrainian since Russia launched its invasion in 2022.“People are searching for Ukrainian identity, a lot of people took a big decision to change language to Ukrainian, and people want Ukrainian literature to read,” says Lopata.“We print all our books in Kharkiv,” she adds, “and we can produce our books only because the people employed at the printworks are still working. The least we can do is come here and do readings.” The sizeable printing industry in Kharkiv is precarious, however: in May last year, several S300 bombsbadly damaged the city’s Factor Druk printworksandkilled seven people.The first poet to read at the Kharkiv poetry festival is Yuliia Paievska, a celebrated combat medic with the nom de guerre “Taira”.Two images side by side: left, Yuliia Paievska seated on stage reads from her debut book of poetry at the Meridian Kharkiv festival; right, deserted streets in Kharkiv city centreYuliia Paievska, call-sign Taira, prepares to read from her debut book of poetry at the festival. Right, deserted streets in Kharkiv city centreShe was captured in March 2022 while treating a civilian in Mariupol, and held in captivity in Russia for several months. She endured appalling conditions and torture until her release in June 2022.Paievska started writing poems in captivity, she says, by taking a tiny piece of plaster and scratching words into the cell wall – a forbidden act. “It pulled me out of the abyss,” she says. Afterwards, she could not remember those fragments with any clarity, only the feelings that had created them. But after her release she began writing poems in earnest.“It was a way of remaining human, of preserving your mind,” she says of those wall-scratchings after her reading. “I wrote in order to remember who I was … Everything in the Russian penitentiary system is aimed at making you sure that you cannot control anything.” All she could control, she says, were “my breathing and poem-making”.Two images side by side: left, Ukrainian poet and film-maker Iryna Tsilyk, wearing a dark blue dress; and the statue of Mykola Gogol in Kharkiv, wrapped up for protection.Poet and film-maker Iryna Tsilyk, and, right, the monument to Mykola Gogol in Kharkiv, wrapped up to protect it from Russian missilesIt is life as a civilian that celebrated film-maker and poet Iryna Tsilyk describes as she takes to the stage, reading, among other poems,My Day, an account of the way that contradictory experiences – sheltering from an air attack, making breakfast for a child, weeping in the shower, choosing wine in the supermarket – are uncomfortably compressed together in wartime Kyiv.She speaks too of a mounting preoccupation in Ukraine: how those from different parts of society, coping with widely differing experiences of war and trauma, are divided by mutual incomprehension.She tells the audience of her own experience, when her husband, novelist Artem Chekh, returned home from the frontline in 2016 (he is now serving in Kyiv, after a stint in the battle for Bakhmut in 2023).“It was a date you’ve been waiting for for six months, and a stranger arrives with sunken shoulders and a glassy stare, because he had spent 10 months in the trenches,” she tells the audience.“You have no idea how you can be together, how to talk, and how to rebuild a shared space of intimacy. I think that many couples are experiencing this and some, unfortunately, do not survive.”audience members at the Meridian Kharkiv festival; Kharkiv city centreAudience members at the Meridian Kharkiv festival; right, anti-tank ‘hedgehogs’ on the streets in Kharkiv city centreMany audience members – most of them in their 20s and 30s – stay for the entire programme of conversations and readings that lasts from lunchtime through to 8.30pm. One of the audience, IT worker Olena Dolya, has a fatalistic approach to remaining in the city: “My windows and balcony are intact,” she says. “And I’m more comfortable at home than anywhere else.”She takes regular trips to Kyiv to experience a fuller cultural life: “I need it and I miss it.” She is reading now more than she has since childhood – “it’s one of my ways of staying sane, and it calms me”, she says.It’s very important to have culture during war. It shows you are humanArsenii Vasyliev“It’s very important to have culture during war,” says copywriter Arsenii Vasyliev, also in the audience. “It shows you are human.” According to his girlfriend, ex-librarian Sofia Kyshkovarova, “The festival is a sign that Kharkiv is alive.”According to Zhadan: “War is a state of maximum abnormality, maximum disintegration. It seems to me that culture, above all else, is capable of somehow conveying these things, of somehow articulating them.“In 50 or 100 years, if humanity survives, if books survive, then we will learn about this war primarily through literature.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayUkraineHeritageEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But compelling new evidence suggests the colonel was actually devoted to the starEamonn FordeMon 4 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 05.32 EDTShareAhuckster. A Svengali. A bully. The public perception of Elvis Presley’s manager Colonel Tom Parker has long positioned him as a byword for duplicitous artist representation, where profitability trumps art and the artist always loses out on the lion’s share.You can see why. Born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk, even the name Colonel Tom Parker was a confection and an invention. Therefore, the presumption runs, so was he. But in The Colonel and the King, a new biography of Parker, Peter Guralnick dispels many of these presumptions to present a far more nuanced portrait of a highly moral operator.Guralnick knows the intricacies of this story more than anyone, except perhaps the colonel and Presley themselves, having written two doorstopper biographies of the singer (1994’s Last Train to Memphis and 1999’s Careless Love). His Parker biography is no less hefty, running close to 600 pages.View image in fullscreenDischarged … Presley laughs as he hands Parker his mustering out pay.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveIt is split in two: the first half a biography; the second half a selected republishing of some of the tens of thousands of letters, memos and telegrams Parker produced and archived through his career. Guralnick was given total access to all this correspondence and was able to see the inner workings and strategic thinking of the man behind the public myth.Researching the book, Guralnick reappraised everything he previously thought about Parker to give him “his rightful place in history”, expressing the tricky balancing act of the biographer. “I intended not to excuse him,” he says, “nor to condemn him.”Parker had the tools either to disarm me or to keep me at arm’s length. He was always five steps aheadParker was born in Breda in the Netherlands in 1909 and came to America illegally in the 1920s without documentation. Thereafter he rewrote his own history, claiming he was born in Huntington, West Virginia. He enlisted in the US military from 1929 and then worked the carnivals before managing musical acts such as Hank Snow, Gene Austin and Eddy Arnold. His Damascene moment was seeing Presley on the Louisiana Hayride in January 1955, understanding instantly he would be a new type of star and that Parker should steer him there.He officially took over Presley’s management in March 1956 and represented a new breed of manager who prized art over commerce. His and Presley’s fates, their successes and their tensions became locked together until Presley’s death in 1977.“This is a completely different person to the one people assume him to be,” says Guralnick, who first met Parker in 1988 and regularly corresponded with him. “He was brilliant and he was funny,” he says of Parker’s playful self-mythologising but wily self-protectionism. “He had the tools either to disarm me or to keep me at arm’s length. He was always five steps ahead.”Parker fully understood his role was to make who he called “the boy” a star while being the bulwark preventing his record label, his live agents and Hollywood in their ambition to “blandify Elvis”. Presley was his own sole creative arbitrator. Parker rarely offered advice on staging and gave no advice on song choices or recording. “Elvis was his artist. He embraced the music because he embraced the artist.”View image in fullscreenElvis performing in Tampa, Florida, in 1955.Photograph: (c) Graceland ArchivesArtist management often involves some level of stage management.Brian Epsteinput the Beatles in suits.Andrew Loog Oldhamungroomed the Rolling Stones.Malcolm McLaren, in his mind at least, was puppet-master of the Sex Pistols. Parker, however, rarely meddled. “Elvis was somebody Parker observed as capable of infinite growth,” says Guralnick. Parker rarely lost his temper and worked 16-18 hours a day, seven days a week, for Elvis. His devotion was total.I ask Guralnick if he thinks Parker’s background in the carnival (historically its people were viewed with suspicion as peripatetic outsiders) or as an immigrant was a factor in the public’s prejudicial interpretation of him. He suggests Parker actually leaned into that rather than flinched from it. “Nobody was either more American or more self-created than Tom Parker,” he argues. His entire American life was one of myth-building.One Las Vegas run for Elvis was renegotiated on a tablecloth in a hotel coffee shop. Parker was asked to consider some “other goodies” (an under-the-table deal) but flatly refused. “Everything is on top of the table or forget it,” insisted Parker. “We don’t do business that way.”The negative view of Parker really only developed afterthe death of Elvis. From the mid-1950s to the mid-70s, Parker was “almost universally” admired in the music and film industries, suggests Guralnick. “I talked to a lot of people over the years who did business with Parker and who said you could trust him implicitly,” he says.Parker believed that all business deals should come with unshakeable morality. “He schooled Hank Saperstein [who handled Presley’s merchandise] on the ethics of business,” says Guralnick, pointing to letters Parker sent instructing Saperstein on how to treat staff and manufacturers fairly.Parker was able to persuade RCA to pay over the odds to buy Presley out of his Sun Records contract in 1955, shelling out $35,000 (plus thousands more in back royalties) when the more established artistFrankie Lainehad been bought out by Columbia for $25,000 in 1951. He also renegotiated Presley’s contract with RCA as soon as the hits started rolling in, significantly improving his terms after just 11 months.Aware of Presley’s incorrigible spending and monumental tax burden (they both saw paying high taxes as patriotic), Parker set up an emergency bank account with $1m in case Presley spent his way into trouble. He was also a regular “fixer” for friends in Presley’s “Memphis Mafia”, quietly stepping in to clean up their mess so that the star would avoid the blowback.View image in fullscreenBig money … at the RCA contract signing in 1955 with Parker, left, and Presley’s parents Gladys and Vernon either side of him.Photograph: (c) Graceland ArchivesParker was, however, a gambling addict, losing as much as $800,000 in one Vegas sitting. Both figures shared a love of spending. “Elvis wasn’t interested in accumulating money – he simply spent it,” insists Guralnick. “And the colonel was no more interested in accumulating money. He lost it at the gaming table.”Parker remained loyal to Presley long after his death, despite having been removed from his business affairs by the family estate in 1983. He did not manage another act after Presley, although he did offer advice toCeline Dionearly in her career. It was not that he felt he was an anachronism, more that he believed he had achieved everything a manger could with the biggest star in the world. To Parker every other act and every other deal would be inferior.Guralnick says: “The letters gave me a window into what was behind the public statements,” and his book is less an uncritical laundering of Parker’s reputation and more a timely recalibration of it.Perhaps the biggest myth about Parker was that he trapped Presley into drecky Hollywood films as a proxy for touring internationally because Parker feared being deported. Guralnick, however, suggests he could easily have secured a US passport through his marriage to a US citizen. Plus he was close friends with President Lyndon B Johnson. Why he did not go through the paperwork to do so remains a mystery.Parker’s letters show that he was seriously considering touring Presley globally up until 1960 and in 1973 was looking into a possible Japanese tour. Guralnick says the real reason Elvis never played outside of the US was not due to Parker but Elvis himself. The star was never that interested, but it was primarily down to his addiction to amphetamines and other drugs, as well as his propensity for carrying guns, making crossing borders impossible for him. Parker expressed concern about getting the right security to protect Presley. “What he was talking about was the security to keep Elvis from being busted. Who was going to carry the drugs, which went with Elvis everywhere? Who was going to carry the guns?”View image in fullscreen‘An introvert who acted like an extrovert’ … Parker and second wife Loanne.Photograph: (c) Graceland ArchivesPresley and the Colonel were complexly woven together, but Guralnick found letters where Parker admitted he was never part of Presley’s social circle, yet seemed at peace with that. They almost separated in 1973 after a falling out in Vegas, yet Parker’s letters from this time calmly outline how they could neatly sever the partnership. “I have no ill feelings,” he wrote, “but I am also not a puppet on a string.”It did not come to that because their mutual dependency was so great, as was their mutual admiration. A rare telegram from Presley on signing the original RCA deal told Parker: “I love you like a father.” But this was more than a paternal relationship. There was, Guralnick feels, a deeper psychological tethering.“I came to see the relationship between Parker and Elvis as a kind of shared tragedy,” he says. “Each had their own addictions. [Parker] was somebody who was so vulnerable, not just at the time but vulnerable from his childhood in ways we simply will never know, suffering from some form of trauma, being somebody who really couldn’t stand to be touched by somebody that he didn’t know.”He was “an introvert who had to learn to act like an extrovert in order to survive”, according to Loanne, his second wife.Parker died in 1997 and took some of his secrets with him to the grave, but Guralnick’s book offers the most rounded, complex and myth-dispelling understanding of him we are ever likely to get.The Colonel and the King by Peter Guralnick (White Rabbit, £35).

Scrape into a bowl, add the flour and salt and mix to make a smooth dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.While the dough is chilling, make the salsa. Heat the remaining four tablespoons of oil in a saucepan, add the onions, cover and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and chilli, and cook for another two minutes. Finely chop the roast tomatoes, add them to the pan, then take off the heat.Now fill the pies. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces, then, using a rolling pin or a tortilla press, flatten each piece into a thin 15cm round. Spoon two tablespoons of the feta mixture into the centre of each circle of dough, fold over to enclose and use your fingers to crimp and seal the edges.To finish, gently reheat the salsa, if need be, then stir in the coriander. Heat the deep-frying oil in a wok or deep pan over a medium-high flame, then, working in batches, fry the pies for three to five minutes, until golden all over. Lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on a plate lined with kitchen towel, and serve at once with the warm salsa for dipping.Maria Bradford is a chef and food writer, and owner ofShwen Shwenin Sevenoaks, Kent.

Here’s how to plan for itStart by working out how much income you will need for a comfortable life, to turn what can seem like a pipe dream into a realityHarriet MeyerMon 4 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTShareSet a target incomeRetiring in your 50s can seem like a pipe dream, particularly with the high costs of living and restrictions on accessing your pension until the age of 55 – rising to 57 in 2028. However, with careful planning and consistent saving, you can increase your chances of an early escape from working life.Start by working out how much income you will need in retirement. According to thePensionsand Lifetime Savings Association, a single person now needs about £31,700 a year for a moderate lifestyle, while a couple needs £43,900 between them. These figures cover the cost of running a car, an annual overseas holiday and an off-peak long weekend break in the UK. Early retirees often spend more at first, packing in travel and hobbies while they are still active.One way to guarantee an income for a set period, or the rest of your life, is to buy something called an annuity. In exchange for a lump sum, you get regular payments, but how big these are depend on your health and your age, and if you buy one in your 50s, you will get less each year than if you wait until you are older.According to the financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown, someone earning £26,000 a year and contributing the standard 8% (5% from theirearnings and 3% from their employer) to their pension from age 22 to 68 could build a fund of about £235,000. This could generate an annuity income of about £16,000 a year in retirement on top of the state pension (now £11,973 a year).View image in fullscreenIf you are aiming to have more leisure time by retiring early, you need to work out how much income you will need when you decide to take that step.Photograph: David Martyn Hughes/AlamyIf they stopped making contributions and bought an annuity at age 57, their fund might be closer to £143,000 – reducing their annual income to about £8,000 before the state pension.To retire at 57 with a £16,000 income from a personal pension, they would probably need to contribute about 13% of their salary throughout their working life on top of the 3% employer contribution.“Even for some very high earners, the pressures of mortgages, raising a family, supporting elderly parents and an elevated cost of living can make a retirement in the early 50s a tough ask,” says David Little of the wealth manager Evelyn Partners. “With improved life expectancies, that might mean a 40-year retirement or more.”Start early and maximise tax breaksBuilding up pension savings early is vital if you want to finish work in your 50s. Under current rules, you can pay up to £60,000 a year into a pension, or up to 100% of your annual earnings, whichever is lower, and still benefit from tax relief.Even modest contributions snowball because every year’s gains are reinvested and start earning their own returns.‘A great perk’: seven ways to make the most of your employee benefitsRead moreCheck whether your employer will match any extra contributions you make or let you use salary sacrifice, as both will boost your pension savings.Salary sacrifice boosts your pension because it reduces your gross salary, meaning you and your employer pay less in national insurance. Some employers pass their NI saving on to your pension, too, which can increase the total contribution.View image in fullscreenYou will need to build up pension savings early if you want to finish work in your 50s.Photograph: Fredrick Kippe/AlamyOne partner can boost another’s future income by making contributions for them. Up to £3,600 a year can go into a pension for a non‑earner and still receive basic‑rate relief. (You do not have to be married/civil partnered).Because pensions are locked until at least age 55 (rising to 57 in 2028), many people planning for early retirement also save into an Isa. You can put up to £20,000 a year into an Isa and benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals, giving you a ready‑made bridge between quitting work and tapping your pension.Invest for growth, then protectHistorically, stocks and shares have typically produced much higher returns than cash. “£1,000 invested in a global tracker fund 20 years ago would have grown to more than £5,000 today,” says Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at the investment platform AJ Bell. “The same amount in a cash Isa earning an average rate over the same time period would be worth about £1,500.“Global equity funds are popular with people in their 20s, 30s and 40s as they offer broad exposure. You can choose low-cost passive options like the Fidelity Index World fund, which tracks more than 1,300 companies across developed markets, including big names like Microsoft and Apple.”The £5,000 figure mentioned is based on investments in a stocks and shares Isa, but the principle of long-term compounding applies to Isa and pension investments.As you approach your target retirement age, Coatsworth recommends shifting strategy. “Once you’re within five years of retiring, think about how your pension will be structured. That could mean moving some of your pot into income-generating assets and potentially dialling down risk.”Some pension providers will automatically gradually reduce investment risk as you get nearer to retirement through something known as “lifestyling”, but it is worth checking where your investments are held. Lifestyling usually starts anything between five and 15 years before retirement. However, your pension provider may need to be told your intended retirement age if it is earlier than the default age.Cut costs and clear debtsReducing your expenses can make retiring in your 50s more achievable. High-interest debts, particularly credit cards and loans, should be paid off as soon as possible.Downsizing your home or relocating somewhere cheaper could free up equity and reduce your outgoings, and reviewing bills, insurance and subscriptions could also reveal some easy savings. Even small reductions in spending can reduce the sum you need to live on each year, helping your money last longer.Bridge the gap to state pensionRetiring early means covering the years before the state pension kicks in. Helen Morrissey, the head of retirement analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, says: “The state pension age is on the way up – [it’s] currently 66 and due to hit 68 by the mid-2040s. Given the important role that the state pension plays in people’s retirement income, much more will need to be saved in the pension to bridge this gap.”The state pension is now just under £12,000 a year. “If it increased by 2.5% per year over a period of 10 years, then that would be about £150,000 extra that would need to be saved into a pension to cover that period if you were looking to retire early,” Morrissey says.You need 35 qualifying years of NI contributions to receive the full amountYou need 35 qualifying years of NI contributions to receive the full amount. Beware that gaps in your NI record to raise children or care for others can mean you fall short of the 35 years needed for the full state pension. This is a particular risk if you are aiming to retire early, as you will have fewer working years to make up the shortfall.You can pay voluntary NI contributions to fill gaps in your record.You can take up to 25% of your pension pot tax-free from age 55 (rising to 57 from 2028). This is often taken as a lump sum, but you can also take it in stages. The rest of your pension withdrawals will be taxed as income.Some early retirees buy fixed-term annuities with part of their pension to provide a guaranteed income until state pension age – rates are more attractive now than in recent years.Little warns against cashing in the 25% tax-free pension lump sum too early: “Taking it all at once in your 50s can deplete your pot quickly. Taking it in tranches makes it last longer.”View image in fullscreenFixed-term annuity rates are more attractive now than in recent years.Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/AlamyTrack and adjustRetirement plans don’t need to be set in stone. Stock markets fluctuate, living costs rise, and plans change. Reviewing your savings annually can help you spot problems early and make adjustments.Most pension providers offer online tools to let you test different scenarios. If you are falling behind, you may need to boost your contributions. If your investments perform better than expected, you might gain extra flexibility.“Early retirement is achievable, but it takes discipline and regular checks,” Morrissey says. “It’s worth setting a reminder to review your plans each year.”Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksPensionsRetirement ageRetirement planningFamily financesWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a no-brainer that those with such serious health issues might have to relocate, as you did, for convalescence, for respite care or building work.It seems unreasonable to me to expect friends and family to foot what can be a considerable bill for treatment and, since concentrators record electricity consumption on an integrated meter unconnected to the household meter, it is straightforward to be able to monitor the costs involved.I first approached NHS England to ask if this restriction was NHS policy and whether there were exemptions for cases such as yours.It referred me to the NHS Sussex Integrated Care Board, which explained that patients can nominate a temporary address as their main residence via their service provider in circumstances such as yours.In the meantime, Vivisol responded to my contact by agreeing to reinstate and backdate your rebates to cover the period while you were away.A spokesperson said: “All communication does highlight that the eligibility only applies at the patient’s main address.

But gains can be made at home without any equipment at allKate LloydMon 4 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTShareScroll through social media for muscle-building advice and the message is often clear: go to the gym; lift weights so heavy you can barely finish your final set. “People assume that’s the only way to build muscle,” says Leigh Breen, professor of translational physiology at the University of Leicester. “But there are other ways.”Muscles grow when we place a demand on them that isn’t typical in our daily lives. If that demand is repeated often enough, the muscles adapt: getting stronger and, yes, larger. But they don’t “know” whether this stimulus to the muscle is coming from a heavy or low load.“You can build muscle at home,” he says, especially if you’re a beginner, “using resistance bands or just your own bodyweight – press-ups, squats, dips, lunges – two or more times a week. It’s also possible to build muscle using lighter weights.” What matters is whether the training places a demand on the muscles and is progressive – that is, that the demand is increased over time.The key to sustained improvement, Breen says, is gradually increasing training volume. You might start with a 5kg dumbbell, but progress by going from 10 to 15 to 20 reps a session as it begins to feel easier. “The muscle should feel fairly fatigued – like you couldn’t do too many more reps.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaturday EditionFree weekly newsletterAn exclusive roundup of the week's best Guardian journalism from the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, free to your inbox every SaturdayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was 72 years old, divorced, fierce and sarcastic. She’d later tell me how caring for her mother as she’d slowly declined with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had put her “firmly in the quality over quantity camp”.View image in fullscreenBetsy Lewis.Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The GuardianShe had already been treated for breast cancer, having gone through surgery, radiation and hormonal therapies some years before. She knew very well the promises and limitations of modern oncology, and that each path had its costs. Hard-earned experience meant she harbored few illusions about any of it.I went over the PET scan she’d had before her admission to the hospital. Masses in both lungs.“We know what that means,” she said, pursing her lips.My job was to provide information, I thought then. Her job would be deciding what we did with it.“Well, yes, I don’t think we’re looking at something that’s curable.”Betsy would later tell me that while she wouldn’t call herself a control freak, she felt driven by a deep need to remain in control of her own circumstances.We would spend the next two years figuring out what that meant.Two weeks later, we went over the biopsy results in my outpatient office. The pathologist had finalized a diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma; subsequent testing had shown that her tumor harbored a significant level of PDL1 expression.“And what does that mean?”“It means it would be reasonable to treat you with immunotherapy alone,” I said, explaining that we could use a drug called pembrolizumab to better allow her own immune system to find and kill the cancer cells inside of her body. “We don’t have to start with any chemotherapy.”“Good, because I’m never going to do any chemotherapy.”I nodded, though I’d heard these declarations before from dozens of other patients. But when the scans showed progression, and the progression was causing pain, and the prospect of one’s death loomed ever closer, red lines drawn in the light of better health suddenly didn’t seem so final.“Sure, we can talk about that when we get there.” I instinctively recoiled from challenging my patients’ values. This was what it meant to give our patients autonomy, I thought.She didn’t say anything, but the look in her eyes told me what I needed to know.I’d later asked how her previous experience getting treated for breast cancer informed her approach to this new diagnosis, how she’d come into it with a rare clarity on what she would and would not accept.“The only negative that stuck with me from breast cancer was never to get married again, because my husband was not supportive.”We laughed.“You know, people say, ‘Oh, they fought and fought and fought,’ and I don’t know that I agree with that. I don’t ever want to be kept alive. I don’t ever want my life to be one day of suffering and fighting after another. I don’t want that.”View image in fullscreenBetsy Lewis.Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The GuardianI could appreciate that. I agreed it wasn’t true that the only sane response to lived experience was more of it. But I also thought chemotherapy occupied an unfair place in the popular imagination. Sometimes, the pain, weight loss and weakness that patients and families blamed on paclitaxel or oxaliplatin were just as much caused by the cancer itself. And often, in the grieving imagination of those left behind, a death from cancer gradually became a death from the treatment.Still, there was no denying the toll taken by the indefinite treatments we recommended to patients with incurable cancers.“My nextdoor neighbor was about 10 years younger than I am and she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the same time, my uncle by marriage was diagnosed with a glioblastoma. I was diagnosed with breast cancer. It was like, ‘Don’t drink the water where we are, you know?’” She paused until I got the joke.“I watched both of them, my uncle and my dear friend go from treatment to treatment to treatment. Never, quote, “giving up” and being pushed by their families to continue treatment. And I thought it was very inhumane. If you’re going to extend somebody’s life by a week and a half or six months, and those six months are going to be hell, I’m not going to sign up for them.”A 2016 study had led to pembrolizumab’s approval for a subset of people with advanced lung cancer. Nearly half of the patients in the trial responded to that drug alone without the use of chemotherapy. And, in a disease where survival is often measured in months, nearly a third were still alive five years later. On average, the patients in the trial lived about two years – a meaningful gain for those who might live only a few months without treatment.I talked about this data with Betsy and her family before she eventually agreed to undergo therapy. She later told me she appreciated that I’d been honest and open about the numbers, that she’d had a good idea from the beginning of how long the treatment would be effective.Growing up, Betsy’s family called her Big Momma – “and it wasn’t a compliment … it was basically implied that I was bossy or needed to have things done my way”. That baseline need was further sharpened by her mother’s exacting standards and the subsequent responsibilities she took on caring for her brother, who suffered from severe mental illness. It further solidified, years later, when she had to find ways to make ends meet as a single mother.In an important way, her fastidiousness was rooted in the knowledge that so much depended on her doing things right the first time. As the decades passed, friends and family learned she could be counted on to help them navigate complicated medical decisions like choosing a nursing home or arranging a home health aide. Now, she’d draw on that energy to get through her own cancer treatment.View image in fullscreenLewis says family and friends have been an instrumental source of support.Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The GuardianOver her first few months on pembrolizumab, her chest and back were slowly covered with a fine red rash that itched like hell – a condition called immune dermatitis, which resulted from the same T-cells that were being activated to fight the patient’s cancer mistakenly targeting their skin. The itching went from a mild annoyance to an around-the-clock obsession that made sleep impossible. Betsy herself described her years-long experience with it as “almost torture”.We recommended plastic jars full of steroid creams, metal tubes of steroid ointments and soothing lotions of varying potency. We also tried an assortment of antihistamines without much success. Poring over case reports online, I found some data to support the prescription of gabapentin – a medication typically used to treat diabetic neuropathy – for her itching. That helped a little.She was also getting more and more fatigued. She still worked from home part-time, but she’d finish for the day and collapse on her couch, sleeping for hours at a time. We checked her thyroid and cortisol levels, both of which are commonly affected by immunotherapy. Both normal. We checked her blood counts. Nearly normal. I couldn’t find anything to fix. We were prisoners of the measurable. I was left recommending her to sleep as much as she could and do only as much as her body allowed.Yet despite all of the negatives, the treatment was also clearly working to control her cancer’s growth.I can recall the feeling of anxious anticipation when I got the message that the results of her first scan were ready. It echoed what I’d felt in high school when I’d gotten a large envelope in the mail from a college I’d applied to – a fragile expectation that contained within it an implicit admonition not to get my hopes up.I took a deep breath and clicked on the result. Her cancer was shrinking. The response continued at six months out. It continued at 12 months.It was difficult to live like that, from scan to scan. Not many are equipped to handle that kind of sustained uncertainty. Betsy seemed to be doing well enough with it, though. At least that’s what she let me see.We felt it was worth it to continue. For now.“I am very good at weighing pluses and minuses,” she told me, “but my pluses and minuses can be very different than someone else’s.” I wondered how long this new equilibrium could last.In the first two years after we diagnosed Betsy’s cancer, I wrote 33 progress notes in her chart. That meant I saw her 33 times, an average of about once every three weeks.We developed a strange kind of intimacy. I didn’t know where she grew up, what her house looked like, what her favorite movie was. Yet, I’d seen into her lungs. I knew why she couldn’t sleep. I had data that told me how long she might live.I was witnessing her facing death. I knew in a very real way what she was about.That vulnerability went only one way, however. Though Betsy and my other patients got to know me, I was able to hide behind the dry-cleaned fabric of my white coat and the emotional remove of my role as doctor. That was how I had been taught to be. My patients didn’t need to know about my hangovers, my heartbreaks. They didn’t need to know, I told myself, what treatments I’d recommend to my own family members.Yet I still think Betsy learned enough about what I was about to stick around. I wasn’t as hidden as I thought. There were plenty of oncologists in our city. For a patient to stay with me was a choice, the implications of which I never took lightly. Our relationship was about more than five-year overall survival numbers and maintaining adequate kidney function.To be the doctor she needed, I knew I’d have to find a way to keep giving her more.In the spring following Betsy’s diagnosis, she was admitted to the hospital with bacterial pneumonia. The cough lingered for weeks, though she eventually recovered enough to make a trip to Colorado.A few months later, she suffered a viral upper respiratory tract infection that was soon complicated by another bacterial pneumonia. Her scans became more difficult to interpret, the smoothly outlined opacities of her cancer now superimposed with the ground glass caused by repeated infections. PET-CT scans showed more metabolic activity in the lungs as well, but it wasn’t clear whether this was a sign of growing cancer cells or an immune system struggling to fight off multiple infections.We spent long visits talking about the implications of those hard-to-parse scans, poring over measurements of size, of metabolic activity. I tried to provide reasonable explanations for any increases, explanations that didn’t involve a growing resistance to the therapy that had been so successful for over a year. I wanted to take what I knew about her case to tell a story that was reassuring. I couldn’t adhere any longer to some imagined ideal of impartiality at odds with what I understood it meant to care for another person.I remember one such visit particularly well, a little over a year into therapy. The scan we’d done before the appointment showed new findings in both breasts. This was not an area that lung cancer was known for going, I told her. We couldn’t explain this away.View image in fullscreenLewis holds a Star of David necklace with a diamond that belonged to her paternal grandmother.Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The GuardianShe was unmoved. “I’ve had that right breast biopsied a few times since I was treated for the breast cancer way back when.”“Still, I’d like you to go see the breast surgeon. Get it checked out. There’s a small spot on the PET scan in the left breast too, even though we can’t feel anything there.” She went under protest.A few weeks later, after talking Betsy into another biopsy, the surgeon called me. It was a small cancer on the left side.My colleagues and I discussed her case with all the relevant specialists, and we shared our recommendations with her. She didn’t want to have surgery and she didn’t want to risk an anti-estrogen medication. What was the point of being aggressive with treating the breast cancer at all, she wondered, given that it was more likely that lung cancer would threaten her life first?Even the medicine sounded like too much. She’d taken it for five years following her first breast cancer diagnosis nearly a decade ago, and it had made her so tired. The pembrolizumab was making her tired enough.We agreed – we would watch it. We’d act not to control the cancer, but to control what we would and would not do about it. The decision had emerged from Betsy’s own history with breast cancer and its treatments. She knew in a very real way what each option would cost her.“So what’s going on with my lung cancer, anyway?” Even a change of subject couldn’t get us any real relief.One scan pointed to it looking worse, another better. I squinted at the pixels on the screen. Maybe if I looked hard enough, I thought, I could see what was going on inside those inscrutable cells. It was like staring into the sun.“I’d have to say things are relatively stable. We’ve been seeing small changes in both ways over the last year. Nothing conclusive.”An exhale. A shift in gravity and light. “I don’t know how long I can keep doing this.” Bone-deep exhaustion. The rash and itching that kept her up at night. Nothing I’d tried had worked. She kept refusing oral steroids – the big gun – because prednisone spiked her anxiety and wrecked what little sleep she got.I could see what was coming. And while I could no longer confine myself to a dry recounting of the facts, I didn’t know what else I could say to change Betsy’s mind.What did it mean to fight? Wasn’t it more important to ask what we were fighting for?August in Houston. A hot, hot afternoon. The humid air so heavy it could be cut into blocks and stored.That day, nearly two years into her treatment, Betsy told me she couldn’t work any longer, couldn’t do anything after noon but nap and lie on her couch.When I think about that appointment now, nearly a year later, it seems delusional that I tried so desperately to convince her to change her mind after she went on to tell me she didn’t want any more infusions.But I was motivated, I think, by a need to move beyond a dispassionate recitation of facts and options. I wanted to help her make a choice that was consistent with what mattered most to her, especially if it wasn’t obvious at first.It was a transition that Drs Linda and Ezekiel Emanuel had written about in a landmark 1992 examination of the doctor-patient relationship they had published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, describing how clinicians might move from a purely informative mode to what they termed a deliberative one. But I didn’t know any of that then. I just wanted her to leave my clinic without any regrets.So I tried to talk her out of her decision. She wasn’t in the hospital, after all. She’d just traveled across the country for her stepdaughter’s wedding. She was living alone and independently in her own home. Her last scans showed that the cancer wasn’t growing.The patients in the trial had each received three years of Keytruda, and she’d be stopping short of two.Would she take a break from treatment and restart in a few months when she was feeling better? I asked.No.Would she take a break and consider chemotherapy?Also no.Her daughter Lindsey later told me that she had made the decision to stop therapy with the firm expectation that the end of her life would soon follow. She’d lived with a sense of fatalism since her breast cancer diagnosis; both of her parents hadn’t made it to their 80s. She’d helped so many navigate their final weeks and months, and the knowledge of death’s inevitability was never far from her mind.Her sister Leslie shared with me that she also had a sense that the treatment had bought her enough time to get her affairs in order. Now that she knew she’d done all she could to make sure her children would be taken care of financially, she felt she could let go.When, against her expectations, she made it to fall, she planned for Thanksgiving to be her grand goodbye. Family from across the country flew to Houston to be with her, and everything was arranged just so. But then she made it to Hanukah, then New Year’s. She continued to feel well enough; she was still working; the scans showed no growth.View image in fullscreenLewis, right, talks with a friend at her home in Houston, Texas.Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The GuardianLindsey tried to remind her mother about how the data showed that a small fraction of patients had made it to five years with something like the therapy she’d gotten. “She goes back and forth between being very fatalistic, like where I’m dying imminently … to ‘I’m not that bad, back off, you’re not my mother.’”She’d crested the hill, taken her hands off the handlebars, entrusted herself to what fate had in store. Her final act of control was to relinquish it. Maybe she thought it was the choice that would best ensure the kind of death she wanted.But when February rolled around and she was still going strong, Lindsey had to finally ask, “OK, we need to start talking about your birthday. We’re running out of time. Do you want this party or not?”On an unseasonably cool May afternoon, I joined Betsy’s family and friends to celebrate her 75th birthday in her back yard, where we shared memories over lemonade and fajitas.When we’d stopped the pembrolizumab nine months before, none of us had known if this celebration was in the cards. Now, we sat together, watching the sun set over the neatly manicured flower beds and the precisely arranged folding tables. Drinks were arrayed on the sideboard in the dining room, and trays of tortillas lay ready in the kitchen.Being on the treatment had made this perfect night possible. Coming off the treatment also had.When I’d told her I wanted to write about her story, Betsy said that she supported the idea. She wanted her family to understand why she’d made the choice that she had.I asked her how her relationships with those closest to her had changed in the months since she’d stopped therapy. “Well, everybody is making their pilgrimages. You don’t have to lift a finger, or you can just sit in your house and people can come, and then when it’s time for them to go, they can go home.”But, for now, it wasn’t time to go home yet, not for another few hours.When faced with serious illness, I think we all want to reach that state of balance in which we neither welcome death nor push it away. Betsy had come closer to that equilibrium than most, and she’d done that by being true to herself. As much as she still expected the end of her life was near, that didn’t mean she wouldn’t celebrate it while she still could.View image in fullscreenLewis gently admires a plant in her home.Photograph: Danielle Villasana/The GuardianThe cake was brought out of the kitchen, and as we sang, circled around, I read the inscription in icing – “Happy Birthday, Bestsy” it said.Her sister said the misspelling had been intentional. On this night, so perfectly planned, we all needed a little reminder that some things in these beautiful lives of ours would always remain just beyond our ability to control them."

Even if you don’t have your own kayak or paddleboard festering in the garage, there are dozens of excellent hire places and guided tours up and down the country, on beautiful rivers, lakes, canals and coastlines. I’ve spent a couple of years researching a book about the loveliest, and here are five of my favourites.Whisky and wildlife, HighlandsFor many years theOld Forge Inn– often referred to as the most remote pub in mainland Britain – was well known for its live music sessions that would break out when the whisky started flowing. Locals and visitors were often moved to take down the musical instruments hanging on the walls and burst into tune. It sounded like the best party in the land, all the more so for the degree of difficulty it took to reach it, and the ridiculous beauty of the surroundings. It’s the only pub in the only village, Inverie, on the Knoydart peninsula, a heathery, mountainous hunk of the Scottish west coast that juts between three deep sea lochs, where seals play and white-tailed eagles soar.And now it’s back. There was a period when things went off the boil under new ownership and the parties dwindled, but in 2022 it was bought by the community and thrives once more. Its pontoon has space for six boats, or you can pull up on the beaches nearby.View image in fullscreenThe village of Inverie.Photograph: John Peter/AlamyTheKnoydart Brewery, occupying a deconsecrated Roman Catholic chapel here, supplies the house ales, while a Knoydart venison burger (£18) from the local deer estate is a menu must, along with cullen skink (£11).As there is no road access, people come by ferry from Mallaig, make the 15-milehike from Kinloch Hourn(a taxi ride from Fort William), or even kayak over – a strenuous and splashy seven miles. Far easier is to hire a kayak when you get there fromLove Knoydartand explore the edges of the pristine loch, looking out for sea otters.On of the best places to stay is theBunkhouse, which has dorms and camping with views to the Isle of Rum (dorm beds from £29pp).Arisaig Sea Kayak Centrecan tailor-make day and multi-day wild camping trips in the area from £130pp per day, minimum four people.A beaver safari in KentView image in fullscreenA beaver at Ham Fen, Kent.Photograph: Whittaker Wildlife UK/AlamyHunted for their pelts to near extinction by the 16th century, beavers have been re-established in certain British rivers, including a stretch of the River Stour near Canterbury. They were reintroduced in 2001 at Ham Fen, aKent Wildlife Reservesite near Sandwich, where they thrived and spread.The most enchanting way to spot nature’s cutest carpenters is on a sunset safari by Canadian canoe down the chalk stream waterway, which ends at a riverside pub.Canoe Wild(£37pp) runs an atmospheric trip, timed to pass the places the beavers visit most frequently at dusk, when they’re most active.Starting at Grove Ferry, you’re whisked by minibus to the village of Fordwich for a guided paddle back of just under five miles. On my September trip, a glorious pink sunset was the backdrop at Bootleg Lake, around which many beavers have dens, and we began to notice slippery mud chutes pocked with paw prints. Then, in the near dark … two loud splashes, and a dark shape careering into the water. “Definitely a beaver,” whispered the guides. “When they hear something coming, they whack their wide tails onto the water to scare away predators.”Even a shadowy splosh felt Attenborough-level exciting under a blazing Milky Way, and we finished in the fairy-lit beer garden of the ivy-wreathedGrove Ferry Inn.Nethergongcampsite nearby has pitches from £42.50, as well as a sauna, yoga and bushcraft classes.A hidden brewery in HampshireView image in fullscreenA creek off the River Hamble leads to the Hidden Tap bar, where drinks are lowered down to the stream.Photograph: Gemma BowesThis fantastically quirky paddle involves a hidden creek, accessible only at high tide, and a place where you can order your drink to be brought straight to your paddleboard or kayak.This beer pilgrimage is on the tidal River Hamble, a baby river of 6.3 miles that flows east of Southampton towards the Solent. At its narrow upper end, near Botley, spidery creeks run off at the sides, including one leading to the Botley Brewery’sHidden Tap bar.Those with their own kit can park at Burridge recreation ground on the east side of the river, then follow a leafy footpath through woods to the water. Or launch further upriver from YMCA Fairthorne (for a £5.50 fee), which rents paddleboards and kayaks and has a cafe and campsite (hire from£20, pitches for four people from£39).Heading upstream towards Botley, the river becomes gentler, narrower and shallower until it feels like an otherworldly bayou. Set off at least two hours before high tide so it’s high at the upper, final navigable end of the river, follow the stream through a tunnel and emerge at the foot of the brewery wall. You yell your order up and your pint is lowered down in a wooden box to be sipped while you float.Another short channel, Curbridge Creek, leads to theHorse and Jockeypub’s waterside beer garden.Let off steam by the SevernView image in fullscreenOne-way canoeing on the River Severn (you take the train back, avoiding paddling upstream)Paddling back the way you’ve come can be a downer, not to mention hard work if it means going against the flow, soRiver Severn Canoes’ solution is rather brilliant. At the end of its self-guided trips down the River Severn from the Shropshire town of Bridgnorth you abandon your vessel and catch asteam train backon the Severn Valley Railway to Highley (£15). Routes of several lengths are available, including four hours to Arley (10½ miles).Halfway along there’s a picnic stop on a beach at the village of Hampton Loade, where you could also have a cuppa and a jacket potato at theUnicorn Inn(mains from £7). It has nine (quite basic) B&B rooms as well as a campsite (pitches for one tent sleeping 2-4 people from £20), if you want to make this your base.Finish in Upper Arley in Worcestershire, home to another traditional, 500-year-old pub,The Harbour. Trains run between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth, stopping at Bewdley, Arley and Hampton Loade. Those with their own kayak or SUP can take them on the train for a £5 fee.In Bridgnorth,The Falcon Hotel(doubles from £140) has 14 rooms with whitewashed beams and exposed brick. River Severn Canoes also offers multi-day trips down the river, stopping at campsites.Kingfishers and canoes in CardiganView image in fullscreenA geodesic dome at the Fforest Farm glamping sitePaddling along the thickly wooded tidal gorge of the River Teifi in Canadian canoes feels utterly otherworldly: peregrine falcons zip from steep banks, kingfishers dart above water busy with salmon, sewin (sea trout) and otters, and there’s a little patch of rapids to tackle on an otherwise gentle two-hour tour withHeritage Canoes(£45 adults/£32.50 children). From its woodland base at theWelsh Wildlife Centre and Teifi Marshes nature reserveit’s two miles upriver to Cilgerran, where a 13th-centurycastletowers above the river.Stay at glamping siteFforest Farm(two nights’ B&B for two from £340), a 10-minute drive east of Cardigan, with a range of cabins and tents – the geodesic domes come with their own Japanese-style wooden bathhouse with a super-deep tub. The site has its own atmospheric pub, Y Bwthyn, in a barely converted barn only open to guests, where candles send their twitchy glow onto slate windowsills, cocktails are made with foraged botanicals and local ale comes fresh from the cask. Cilgerran has a couple of heartwarming pubs, including the Cardiff Arms (no website), with a coracle hung outside; or head to Cardigan’s waterside bar atAlbion Aberteifi, Fforest’s hip apart-hotel, or, on the opposite bank, itsPizzatipi, which has a festival feel.Gemma Bowes’Paddle and Pubis published byBloomsbury(£19.99).

But at this year’s Edinburgh Fringe she will be on stage alone, doing all the ‘things I shouldn’t be doing’Paula CocozzaMon 4 Aug 2025 01.56 EDTShareAt 82, Christine Thynne is an emerging artist. “Risk! There’s a colossal amount of risk,” Thynne says. She is about to perform her show, These Mechanisms, over three weeks at the Edinburgh fringe. While “emerging” isn’t a word often applied to artists in their 80s, Thynne says the description is appropriate. “I wasn’ttherebefore,” she says. “I wasn’t a solo performer.”Thynne’s show melds aspects of her life – she trained as a physiotherapist in the 1960s – along with other passions. Among her props are planks, stepladders and water. “Things I shouldn’t be doing,” she says. “Moving scaffolding planks. Changing the shape of stepladders. Carrying water.”She enjoys sea kayaking, having progressed from being coached to paddling the Lofoten islands in Norway, in her 50s. “Sliding up a wave, going down the other side – it was so exciting,” she says. But when she was browsing the Grassmarket area ofEdinburgh, Scotland, where she lives, and saw a brochure for a class inDance Base, Scotland’s national centre for dance, she balked.View image in fullscreenDuring rehearsals for These Mechanisms.Photograph: Amy SineadThe class was free for the over-60s, and Thynne was 68. “I thought: ‘Dare I?’”For many people, kayaking in open water would be scarier than joining a dance class, but “in life”, Thynne says, “there are occasions when you can lose your self-confidence. You can lose your identity. I was very nervous, wondering could I do it, would I be good enough?”She had done a bit of ballet and tap growing up in the north-east of England, and loved sport. Not to compete, but because she “loved the way the body moved”. At 16, she wrote to the chartered society of physiotherapists, and did a course on day release while working locally at Imperial Chemical Industries.“I still love the way the body moves,” she says, “How you can feel the tension in a muscle – is it the right place you’re feeling? Which muscles are weak? Which joints are affected? And how even with simple exercise, you can make people feel much better.”After a divorce in the mid-1980s, she embarked on a second career, teaching movement and music, and anatomy and massage to therapists, while raising two teenage sons.She has loved the outdoors since her mum, who was a professional musician, took Thynne and her two sisters “out into the fresh air, to have this love of the countryside, to go brambling, to walk. She gave that to us.”Thynne, similarly, is “somebody who pushes myself, takes opportunities, takes a risk,” she says. “I’m obviously prepared to go on trying and doing, [asking] can I do this? And then being surprised that yes, I can.”When she went to her first dance session, it was “won-der-ful!” she says, singing the word. “I realised that somebody was teaching me what to do, and there was music playing and I could let go and I felt that joy of my body moving, coming through me.”She progressed to Prime, Dance Base’s semi-professional company for over-60s. After that came funding fromLuminate, Dance Base,Creative Scotlandand Made in Scotland. For These Mechanisms, she has collaborated with the choreographer Robbie Synge. “It’s almost as if I’m having another career.”Along the way, she has learned “to listen … to find out more about myself, my capabilities. How to put my point of view forward, to be part of a team.” She hopes to tour the show overseas.View image in fullscreenChristine Thynne performing with Prime dance company in 2023.Photograph: Amy SineadIn the meantime, she keeps fit. “Each morning, I hang for two or three minutes, take my body weight, then I turn around and hang the other way. Then I do some gentle stretching.” And, of course, she dances. All the time. “I probably dance if I am going from the fridge to the cooker, taking some dishes,” she says, swirling her hands in the air. “Isn’t that what dance is? You just have to let go and explore it.”These Mechanisms isn’t exactly autobiographical, but it “tells a story of persistence, of joy, of risk”, which sounds like Thynne. “You could do this in your 20s, you could do it in your 80s,” she says. “It’s about the limits of the human body and the desire to make things happen.”These Mechanismsruns until 20 August at DB3 as part of Dance Base’s fringe programme, delivered in partnership with Assembly festivalTell us: has your life taken a new directionafter the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60DanceAgeingEdinburgh festivalEdinburgh festival 2025FestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ambigrams – you won’t believe these flipping words!A pun, a puzzle and a work of artUPDATE: Read the solutions hereAlex BellosMon 4 Aug 2025 02.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 11.51 EDTShareDouglas Hofstadter is probably best known as the author ofGödel, Escher Bach, a classic of popular science writing published in 1979.In 1983, he coined the word “ambigram”, meaning a piece of text that can be read in more than one way, an art form pioneered in the 1970s by the typographers Scott Kim and John Langdon. Typically, an ambigram is a word or phrase that has left-right mirror symmetry, or reads the same upside down.Hofstadter, aged 80, is professor of cognitive science and comparative literature at Indiana University, and has produced thousands of ambigrams over the decades. Here’s one that is pleasingly self-referential, taken from his latest book,Ambigrammia. It has a vertical line of symmetry through the “g”, which means you can read it left to right, and also in a mirror. The ‘ambi’ when reflected reads ‘rams’.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Douglas HofstadterHere’s another one, geographically appropriate, that has 180 degree rotational symmetry. (It reads the same upside down.)View image in fullscreenIllustration: Douglas HofstadterIsn’t it clever? The dots underneath the “r” and the “t” do not distract from the letters, but when upside down are clearly the dots on two “i”s.Hofstadter describes each ambigram as a “pocket-sized creativity puzzle.” So I thought they would make a perfect challenge for this column.Flipping wordsDesign an ambigram for the following words:1. DAVE2. OHIO3. UTAH4. RED5.Your own nameThe aim in an ambigram is legibility. You want the word to be as readable as possible. Usually an ambigram has perfect symmetry (mirror or rotational) as in the the two examples above, but not always, as in ‘GREEN’ in the top image.You can use upper case, lower case, or a mixture of the two. You will need to experiment at first. How much you can tweak a letter without making it unrecognisable, and how much you can add without overwhelming the eye?With DAVE, the A and the V are (almost) inversions of each other. Harder is to see how to make an E into an upside down D.I’ll be back at 5pm UK with Hofstadter’s designs for 1 to 5. If you would like me to feature your designs of your names in that post, please eitheremail meor tag me onTwitterorBluesky.UPDATE: To see a gallery of designs for the above challenge click here.Ambigrammiaby Douglas Hofstadter, with an introduction by Scott Kim, is out now on Yale University PressI’ve been setting a puzzle here on alternate Mondays since 2015.

But who will it benefit? And why does he wish the tech giants had moved more slowly?Mon 4 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.37 EDTShareIf you have a mental image of a Nobel prizewinner, Demis Hassabis probably doesn’t fit it. Relatively young (he’s 49), mixed race (his father is Greek-Cypriot, his mother Chinese-Singaporean), state-educated, he didn’t exactly look out of place receiving his medal from the king of Sweden in December, amid a sea of grey-haired men, but it was “very surreal”, he admits. “I’m really bad at enjoying the moment. I’ve won prizes in the past, and I’m always thinking , ‘What’s the next thing?’ But this one was really special. It’s something you dream about as a kid.”Well, maybe notyou, but certainly him. Hassabis was marked out as exceptional from a young age – he was a chess prodigy when he was four. Today, arguably, he’s one of the most important people in the world. As head of GoogleDeepMind, the tech giant’s artificial intelligence arm, he’s driving, if not necessarily steering, what promises to be the most significant technological revolution of our lifetimes.As such, Hassabis finds himself in the position of being both a booster for AI and an apologist for it. The Nobel prize in chemistry was proof of the benefits AI can bring: DeepMind’s AlphaFold database was able to predict the hitherto-unfathomable structures of proteins, the building blocks of life – a breakthrough that could lead to myriad medical advances. At the same time, fears are ever growing about the AI future thatGoogleis helping to usher in.Being an AI ambassador is the part Hassabis didn’t dream about. “If I’d had my way, we would have left it in the lab for longer and done more things like AlphaFold, maybe cured cancer or something like that,” he says. “But it is what it is, and there’s some benefits to that. It’s great that everyone gets to play around with the latest AI and feel for themselves what it’s like. That’s useful for society, actually, to kind of normalise it and adapt to it, and for governments to be discussing it … I guess I have to speak up on, especially, the scientific side of how we should approach this, and think about the unknowns and how we can make them less unknown.”In person Hassabis is a mix of down-to-earth approachability and polished professionalism. Trim and well groomed, dressed entirely in black, he wears two watches: one a smart watch, the other an analogue dress watch (smart but not too flashy). He gives the impression of someone in a hurry. We’re speaking in his office at DeepMind’s London headquarters. On the walls outside are signed chess boards from greats such as Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Judit Polgár. He still plays; there’s a board set up on a table nearby.View image in fullscreenHassabis being awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry by the king of Sweden last year.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was the chess that started Hassabis down the path of thinking about thinking. Between the ages of four and 13 he played competitively in England junior teams. “When you do that at such a young age, it’s very formative for the way your brain works. A lot of the way I think is influenced by strategic thinking from chess, and dealing with pressure.”On paper there’s little else about Hassabis’s background that foretold his future. His family are more on the arty side: “My dad’s just finished composing a musical play in his retirement, which he staged at an arthouse theatre in north London. My sister’s a composer, so I’m kind of the outlier of the family.” They weren’t poor, but not super-wealthy. He moved between various state schools in north London, and was homeschooled for a few years.He was also a bit of an outsider at school, he says, but he seems to have known exactly where he was going. His childhood heroes were scientific pioneers such asAlan TuringandRichard Feynman. He spent his chess winnings on early home computers such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and a Commodore Amiga, and learned to code. “There were few people that were interested in computers in the late 80s. There was a group of us that used to hack around, making games and other stuff, and then that became my next career after chess.”In the 90s, the games industry was already working with AI. When he was 17, he coded the hit game Theme Park, in which players had to build a virtual amusement park. “The game reacted to how you were playing it,” he says. Put a food stall too close to the rollercoaster exit and your virtual punters would start throwing up.I said to Elon Musk, ‘What if AI was the thing that went wrong? Then being on Mars wouldn’t help you’After studying computer science at the University of Cambridge, then a PhD at University College London in neuroscience, he set up DeepMind in 2010 with Shane Legg, a fellow postdoctoral neuroscientist, and Mustafa Suleyman, a former schoolmate and a friend of his younger brother. The mission was straightforward, Hassabis says: “Solve intelligence and then use it to solve everything else.”DeepMind soon caught Silicon Valley’s attention. In 2014 the team showed off an AI that learned to master Atari video games such as Breakout, without any prior knowledge. Interest started to come from now-familiar tech players, including Peter Thiel (who was an early DeepMind investor), Google, Facebook and Elon Musk. Hassabis first met Musk in 2012. Over lunch at Space X’s factory in California, Musk told Hassabis his priority was getting to Mars “as a backup planet, in case something went wrong here. I don’t think he’d thought much about AI at that point.” Hassabis pointed out the flaw in his plan. “I said, ‘What if AI was the thing that went wrong? Then being on Mars wouldn’t help you, because if we got there, it would obviously be easy for an AI to get there, through our communication systems or whatever it was.’ He just hadn’t thought about that. So he sat there for a minute without saying anything, just sort of thinking, ‘Hmm, that’s probably true.’”Shortly after, Musk, too, became an investor in DeepMind.In 2014, Google bought the company for £400m (as a result, Musk and Thiel switched to backing the rival startup OpenAI). It wasn’t just access to cash and hardware that convinced them to go with Google. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were computer scientists like him, and “saw Google as ultimately an AI company”, says Hassabis. He also used products such as Gmail and Maps. “And finally, I just thought that the mission of Google, which is to organise the world’s information, is a cool mission.”View image in fullscreenHassabis speaking before the Google DeepMind Challenge match in Seoul in 2016, in which it triumphed over South Korean Go grandmaster Lee Sedol.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesFrom his office window, we can see the vast beige bulk of Google’s just-about-finished new office, where DeepMind will be moving next year. It’s fair to say the reason the tech giant is putting so much into Britain is because of Hassabis, who insisted on staying in London. “Our first backers were like, ‘You’ve got to move to San Francisco,’ but I wanted to prove it was possible here,” he says. “I knew there was untapped talent around. And I knew, if we were successful, how important [AI] would be for the world, so I felt it was important to have a global approach to it, and, not just, you know, 100 square miles of Silicon Valley. I still believe that’s important.”In 2016, DeepMind again caught the tech world’s attention when its AI defeated one of the world’s best players of Go – a board game considerably more complex than chess. The AlphaFold breakthrough on protein structures was another leap forward: DeepMind has now solved the structures of over 200m proteins and made the resourcepublicly available.But the AI landscape shifted seismically in 2022 with the release of OpenAI’sChatGPT, which captured the public imagination with its uncanny ability to tackle a host of problems – from strategy planning to writing poetry. ChatGPT caught big tech off guard, especially Google. “They really went for scaling, almost in a bet-the-house sort of way, which is impressive, and maybe you have to do that as a startup,” says Hassabis. “We all had systems that are very similar, the leading labs, but we could see the flaws in it, like it would hallucinate sometimes. I don’t think anyone fully understood, including OpenAI, that there would be these amazing use cases for it, and people would get a lot of value out of them. So that’s an interesting lesson for us about how you can be a bit too close to your own technology.”We’ll have something that will exhibit all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10 yearsThe race is now on. DeepMind has become “the engine room of Google”, as Hassabis puts it, and AI is being built into every corner of its business: AI search summaries; smart assistant Gemini (Google’s answer to ChatGPT); an AI image generator (that can add in sound effects); AI-powered smart glasses, translation tools, shopping assistants. How much the public really craves this AI-enhanced world remains to be seen. Competitors are also raising their game. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and others are investing heavily, and poaching talent from their rivals. Zuckerberg is offering $100m salaries for top researchers. Suleyman, who left DeepMind in 2019, isnow head of Microsoft AI, which recentlypoached more than 20 engineersfrom DeepMind. He hesitates to call his former friend a rival: “We do very different things. I think he’s more on the commercial applied side; we’re still focused more on that frontier research side.”View image in fullscreen‘I believe in human ingenuity’ … Hassabis.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianThat frontier to be reached is surely AGI – “artificial general intelligence” – the pivotal point at which AI matches human intelligence. “I don’t know if it will be a single moment. It may be a gradual thing that happens,” he says, “but we’ll have something that we could sort of reasonably call AGI, that exhibits all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10 years, possibly the lower end of that.”In other words, we are in the final few years of pre-AGI civilisation, after which nothing may ever be the same again. To some the prospect is apocalyptic, to others, like Hassabis, it’s utopian.“Assuming we steward it safely and responsibly into the world, and obviously we’re trying to play our part in that, then we should be in a world of what I sometimes call radical abundance,” says Hassabis. He paints a picture of medical advances, room-temperature superconductors, nuclear fusion, advances in materials, mathematics. “It should lead to incredible productivity and therefore prosperity for society. Of course, we’ve got to make sure it gets distributed fairly, but that’s more of a political question. And if it is, we should be in an amazing world of abundance for maybe the first time in human history, where things don’t have to be zero sum. And if that works, we should be travelling to the stars, really.”Is he getting too close to his own technology? There are so many issues around AI, it’s difficult to know where to even begin: deepfakes and misinformation; replacement of human jobs; vast energy consumption; use of copyright material, or simply AI deciding that we humans are expendable and taking matters into its own hands.To pick one issue, the amount of water and electricity that future AI datacentres are predicted to require is astronomical, especially when the world is facing drought and a climate crisis. By the time AI cracks nuclear fusion, we may not have a planet left. “There’s lots of ways of fixing that,” Hassabis replies. “Yes, the energy required is going to be a lot for AI systems, but the amount we’re going to get back, even just narrowly for climate [solutions] from these models, it’s going to far outweigh the energy costs.”There’s also the worry that “radical abundance” is another way of framing “mass unemployment”: AI is already replacing human jobs. When we “never need to work again” – as many have promised – doesn’t that really mean we’re surrendering our economic power to whoever controls the AI? “That’s going to be one of the biggest things we’re gonna have to figure out,” he acknowledges. “Let’s say we get radical abundance, and we distribute that in a good way, what happens next?”Hassabis has two sons in their late teens(his Italian-born wife is a molecular biologist). What does he envisage for their future? “It’s a bit like the era I was growing up in, where home computers were coming online. Obviously it’s going to be bigger than that, but you’ve got to embrace the new technology ... If you become an expert, kind of a ninja, at using these things, it’s going to really empower the people that are good at these tools.”Non-ninjas will still have a place, however: “We need some great philosophers, but also economists to think about what the world should look like when something like this comes along. What is purpose? What is meaning?” He points out that there are many things we do that aren’t strictly for utility: sports, meditation, arts. “We’re going to lean into those areas, as a society, even more heavily, because we’ll have the time and the resources to do so.”View image in fullscreenHassabis, age 23, in 1999, when he was head of Elixir Studios.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianIt’s difficult to see Hassabis himself carving out much of that time, between DeepMind, his drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs and his endless public appearances – the list goes on. “I don’t have much time that isn’t working, seven days a week,” he acknowledges. “I spend time with my kids playing games, board games, and that’s some of my most fun times.” He doesn’t let them win, he says. “We play very competitively.”He’s also a season ticket holder at Liverpool FC and makes it to “six, seven games a year”. He still plays chess online – “It’s a bit like going to the gym, for the mind.” And he’s a mean poker player, apparently. The night after winning his Nobel prize he celebrated with a poker night with Magnus Carlsen and some world poker champions. “In another universe, I might have been a professional gamer.”So, no fears about the future? “I’m a cautious optimist,” he says. “So overall, if we’re given the time, I believe in human ingenuity. I think we’ll get this right. I think also, humans are infinitely adaptable. I mean, look where we are today. Our brains were evolved for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and we’re in modern civilisation. The difference here is, it’s going to be 10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.” The Industrial Revolution was not plain sailing for everyone, he admits, “but we wouldn’t wish it hadn’t happened. Obviously, we should try to minimise that disruption, but there is going to be change – hopefully for the better.”This article was amended on 4 August 2025 because an earlier version said OpenAI’s “ChatGPT3” was released in 2020; that meant to refer to ChatGPT, which was released in 2022. The organisation’s GPT-3 was released in 2020, but not to the general public.Explore more on these topicsDeepMindThe G2 interviewArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleElon MuskNobel prizesSilicon ValleyChatGPTinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The UN migration agency said 157 people were onboard.The IOM’s Yemen head, Abdusattor Esoev, said the boat had been on a dangerous route often used by people-smugglers and was heading to Abyan governorate in southern Yemen, a frequent destination for boats smuggling African people hoping to reach the wealthy Gulf states.Ethiopian and Yemen mapSome of those rescued have been transferred to the Yemeni port of Aden, near Abyan, a security official said.Despite the civil war that has ravaged Yemen since 2014, the impoverished country has remained a popular transit point for irregular migration, in particular fromEthiopia, which itself has been roiled by ethnic conflict.Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Holy See’s secretary of state, said the pope was “deeply saddened by the devastating loss of life”.Each year, thousands of people brave the so-called “eastern route” from Djibouti to Yemen across the Red Sea, in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.The IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the Red Sea route last year, 462 of them from boat accidents.Ayla Bonfiglio of the Mixed Migration Centre research and policy organisation told Agence France-Presse: “This route is predominantly controlled by smugglers and human-trafficking networks … Refugees and migrants have no other alternative but to hire their services.“Migrants are well aware of the risks, but with no legal pathways and families relying on remittances from Saudi Arabia or the Emirates, many feel they have no choice.”At least eight people died after smugglers forced 150 people off a boat in the Red Sea in June, according to the IOM.Yemeni security forces were recovering a “significant” number of bodies, the Abyan directorate said on Sunday.On their way to the Gulf, migrants cross the Bab al-Mandab strait, the narrow waterway at the mouth of the Red Sea that is a popular route for international trade, as well as for migration and human trafficking.Once in Yemen, the Arabian peninsula’s poorest country, migrants often face other threats to their safety.What will the AI revolution mean for the global south?Read moreThe IOM says tens of thousands of migrants had become stranded in Yemen and suffered abuse and exploitation during their journeys.In April, more than 60 people were killed in a strike blamed on the US that hit a migrant detention centre in Yemen, according to the Houthi rebels who control much of the country.The wealthy Gulf monarchies host significant populations of foreign workers from south Asia and Africa.The Abyan security directorate described a huge search-and-rescue operation given the large number of dead and missing people.

Let Bolsonaro speak!”In his ruling, Moraes noted that despite being banned from using social media, the far-right leader took part by phone in a pro-Bolsonaro demonstration on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday. During the rally, one of his politician sons, senator Flávio Bolsonaro, held a phone to the microphone so the crowd could hear the former president speak.View image in fullscreenA frame grab from AFPTV shows Brazil’s senator Flavio Bolsonaro (R) broadcasting a phone call with his father, Jair Bolsonaro, during a demonstration at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro.Photograph: Bruno Kaiuca/AFPTV/AFP/Getty ImagesThe senator himself had posted a video on social media showing Bolsonaro addressing supporters by phone – but later deleted the footage. Moraes argued that the deletion was a “blatant” attempt to conceal the breach of court-ordered restrictions.“The flagrant disregard for the preventative measures was so obvious that – it bears repeating – the defendant’s own son, senator Flávio Nantes Bolsonaro, decided to delete the post from his Instagram account in order to conceal the legal transgression,” Moraes wrote.The arrest order is part of an ongoing supreme court case in which Bolsonaro is accused of leading a plot to overturn the results of the last election, in which current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva defeated the former army captain.The trial is expected to conclude later this year, with Bolsonaro facing a potential sentence of more than 40 years in prison.“Bolsonaro is being arrested gradually,” said political commentator Fernando Gabeira on GloboNews. “The supreme court, consciously or not, is leading him to prison in stages – to avoid a major shock.”In Brasilía, the political temperature has been rising in recent days, with thousands of Bolsonaro supporters on Sunday rallying outside the central bank to offer their support.Many of those protesters urged the US president Donald Trump – whorecently hit Brazil with 50% tariffsin retribution for the alleged “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro – to take further action to help save their embattled leader.“I’d like to give Trump a hug and tell him: thank you for worrying about us,” said Álvaro Junior, 64, one Bolsonaro supporter who was carrying a sign that read: “Thank you, Trump”.Metal barricades have been erected around the supreme court, foreign ministry and congress in anticipation of possible rightwing protests or violence.Trump further stoked the political flames last week by slapping sanctions on Moraes, who the US secretary of the treasury, Scott Bessent, accused of being “responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights and politicized prosecutions – including against former president Jair Bolsonaro”.Lindovaldo Ribeiro Paulo, a 43-year-old in a red Maga cap, hailed the sanctions on Moraes, saying: “We feel even more admiration and even love for the American people now.”In Monday’s ruling, Moraes said Bolsonaro had “repeated his unlawful conduct in an even more severe and defiant manner”, continuing to “urge and incite a foreign head of state to take measures aimed at unlawfully interfering with the normal course of judicial proceedings – in an attempt to generate social pressure on Brazilian authorities, in flagrant violation of national sovereignty”.Explore more on these topicsBrazilJair BolsonaroAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

All of those factors are driven by global heating, NRC says.Some others, including one discovered Thursday on the banks of Cameron Lake in British Columbia, were human-caused, according to officials.Monica Vaswani, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment Canada, said this year is shaping up to be a “particularly bad wildfire season”.“This is not unlike what we’ve been seeing in the last few years … unfortunately it’s kind of becoming a little bit more the norm,” she said.Vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children and those with respiratory or heart issues have been advised to reduce time outdoors in Toronto and the surrounding municipalities. There is a risk for the general population as well and indoor activities are recommended, said Vaswani.So far this year, 6,625,375 sq metres of land in Canada have burned due to fires, which is about 82% higher than all of 2024, which then resulted in 2,785,140 sq metres burned, according to the CIFFC.Republicans complain to Canada over wildfire smoke despite supporting planet-heating billRead moreThe fires have also resulted in several evacuations across Canada in the last week. In northern Manitoba, a full evacuation order was issued for the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation due to wildfires. More than 400 properties have been ordered to vacate as a result on the east coast of Vancouver Island – and the fire is a mere 90km north-west of Victoria, British Columbia.The Saskatchewan village of Pinehouse, located about 500km north of the city of Saskatoon, also was under an evacuation order this week. The largest fires in the country are currently across the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with several larger than 100,000 hectares.The smoke from those fires continues to drift down across the Canadian border with the United States. On Monday, air quality alerts were issued for Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, parts of Nebraska and regions in Illinois and Indiana. People in the eastern states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are also being advised by officials to limit outdoor activity due to the wildfires.Explore more on these topicsCanada wildfiresWildfiresAmericasCanadaClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

It is likely to play a significant role in the company’s plan to increase its oil and gas production to between 2.3m to 2.5m barrels of oil equivalent a day.The company said on Monday it had also started a new oil extension project in the Gulf of Mexico that should add an extra 20,000 barrels a day to its production. The Argos project would be the first in a series of new projects in the Gulf between now and the end of the decade.BP has returned its focus to fossil fuels in recent years after abandoning itsfailed plan to cut its hydrocarbon production, which had favoured expanding in low-carbon energy alternatives, such as offshore wind.Gordon Birrell, the head of BP’s oil and gas production business, said the discovery was “another success in what has been an exceptional year so far” which had underscored the company’s “commitment to growing our upstream” oil and gas production.He added that Brazil was an important country for BP, which will explore the potential of establishing “a material and advantaged production hub in the country”.The Santos basin, which is in coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, is BP’s second discovery in Brazil this year. The group has also announced oil and gas discoveries in Trinidad, Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico, Libya, Namibia and Angola, in a marked retreat from its former green agenda.The company’s plan to become a “net zero” energy company has faceda string of unforeseen hurdlessince it was put in motion inearly 2020.The Covid-19 pandemic triggered one of its worst financial results – a $5.7bn loss for 2020 – since it reported a $4.9bn loss for 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In 2022, it was forced totake a $25bn hitafter offloading its stake in the Russian oil company Rosneft after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.While the company invested heavily in the offshore wind industry, which has suffered increasing costs in recent years, its rivals were able to exploit the surge in fossil fuel prices after the Russian invasion by pumping more oil and gas.BP, which announces its half-year results on Tuesday, said last month that it would sell its share in 10 US onshore windfarms to the New York-headquartered LS Power. On Monday it launched its 50:50 offshore wind joint venture with the Japanese wind company Jera worth up to £4.5bn, which it plans to use to gain some access to zero-carbon wind energy developments while focusing on fossil fuels.Amid BP’s floundering net zero strategy, its former chief executive Bernard Looney was sacked from the company for failing to disclose to the board his relationships with his staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move means Opec+ has now fully reversed its largest tranche of output cuts, made as oil demand slumped after the Covid-19 pandemic.The oil price was down 2% on Monday, with Brent at just over $68 a barrel.Explore more on these topicsBPOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industryBrazilFossil fuelsCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The demolition of 48 cliffside establishments at Bingin beach – ranging fromwarungs(small eateries) and homestays to boutique villas and restaurants overlooking one of the world’s most revered waves – marks a flashpoint in Bali’s struggle with mass tourism, overdevelopment and the desire to retain the cultural and surfing heritage that put the island on the global tourist map in the first place.Bingin is being cleared as part of a campaign led by the re-elected governor, Wayan Koster, to enforce zoning regulations and eliminate unregulated structures on protected government-owned land.“The Bali provincial government is preparing a team to conduct an investigative audit of tourism business permits throughout Bali,” said Koster, hammer in hand at the start of the Bingin demolition in July. “We cannot allow it. If we let these methods continue throughout Bali, Bali will be ruined.”View image in fullscreenDozens of villas and restaurants that were built without government permission on Bingin beach in Badung, Bali.Photograph: Sonny Tumbelaka/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 20 other businesses have also been targeted as allegedly illegal by local authorities at nearby Balangan beach, and others across the Bukit peninsula and beyond may soon face similar action.But for many locals, the loss of Bingin represents a further gutting of a historic and cherished part of the island’s surf culture that in many places has been overtaken by mega resorts, shopping strips and beach clubs.Surfers, many of them Australian, began arriving at Bingin in the 1970s and 1980s, attracted by its perfect mechanical left-hand barrel waves. Local families built smallwarungson the cliffs to serve them. Among them was Kelly’s Warung, established by the family of local professional surfer Mega Semadhi.“This place feels like home, away from the noise and chaos above – a beautiful beach, beautiful wave and people,” Samadhi told the Guardian. “There are not many places like this left.”Over time, the area grew and commercialised, with some rooms now renting for over A$200 a night and small family-run businesses morphing into multi-level luxury suites like the towering Morabito Art Cliff boutique hotel, with multiple swimming pools – and one even in its master suite.As crime surges in Bali, locals are wondering: ‘Are the tourists coming here getting worse?’Read more“The developments got out of control and people got greedy,” said Semadhi, who lives and works in the village nearby with his wife and two young children. “We tried to stop it, but the government didn’t listen to us [at the time]. And now it’s too late.”Semadhi called for the community to be involved in the future of the area. “If they are going to redo it, we want to do it properly. To return the soul of how it started. If we lose this place, all of Bingin will suffer.”Tourists have also expressed dismay; many gathered on the beach throughout the week after the demolition began, completely unaware of the plans.Several Australian expats said they had been advised against speaking out publicly, with concerns they could be deported.An Australian surfer and local business owner, who first visited Bingin over 30 years ago, described it as a “very special place”.“The first time I came down here, we could only eat food and sleep on people’s decks. There was something magical about it,” he said. “Australians were among the first surfers to come here and form a special relationship with the Balinese. There aren’t many places like this left.”Business owners – many foreigners, including Australians – say many of the structures existed before zoning rules were formalised and the land became deemed a protected area, and efforts were made to ensure operations were compliant.Alex Barung, a lawyer representing some owners attempting to halt the demolitions, said the community had tried multiple times to resolve the issue and work with the government.“In 1985, the community realised the tourism potential and built supporting facilities. They lacked capital and so partnered with foreigners – but the businesses came first, before the regulations.”Owners argue that they were operating under customary law, with informal permission from the village to operate.View image in fullscreenCritics question the transparency and consistency of the government’s enforcement of regulations.Photograph: Sara ClericoCritics of the demolition – which officials expect to take a month – warn that erasing Bingin risks destroying a unique cultural and social ecosystem.“This is part of Bali’s surfing heritage,” said Piter Panjaitan, a local surfer and environmentalist. “It became a hotspot, a golden egg of the Bukit peninsula. Now, 1,000 people are losing their jobs overnight. People are crying.”He questioned the transparency and consistency of the government’s approach. “We understand the need to clean up, but why here, and why like this? We want to make Bali better, but we also want social justice.”The demolition highlights challenges in Bali’s growth. The island’s population has doubled since the 1960s to more than 4 million, and tourist arrivals are projected to hit 6.5 million this year.The government has floated – and abandoned – a moratorium on tourism development, opting instead for tighter controls. Local environmental group Walhi Bali said it supported reining in unregulated growth but criticised “selective enforcement”.“From our research, there are many other developments across Bali lacking permits and environmental assessments,” said Walhi Bali’s Ida Bagus Arya Yoga Bharata. “The inconsistency highlights the slow and weak governance in Bali’s development planning.”View image in fullscreenKomang Agus, the manager of Morabito Art Cliff villa, standing amid the rubble.Photograph: Sara ClericoThe head of Bali’s Public Order Agency, I Dewa Nyoman Rai Darmadi, denied claims the demolitions were clearing space for luxury developments. “That’s a hoax,” he told the Guardian. He said it was about safety, with many businesses packed into the steep cliff zone and that public land was “not for business like currently”.“This is protected land. There’s no indication of it being taken over by an investor.”Still, uncertainty looms, even from officials.“Once it’s renovated, it will become an attraction – whether for surfers or something else,” said Governor Koster. “At the very least, tourists will want to come, and it will contribute to the wellbeing of the local community.”And without a clear plan, locals worry the area could be redeveloped without them.But despite the sadness, Semadhi said he was optimistic about the future.“If they are going to do it, then maybe we can do it properly this time, a new beginning. But let us be part of it. Don’t erase the soul of Bingin.”Explore more on these topicsBaliConstruction industryIndonesiaTourism (Australia)Asia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

On the same day, local temperature records were broken in 39 locations – including in Kyoto, which reached 40C for the first time – with almost a third of the Japan Meteorological Agency’s weather stations reporting highs above 35C. This is the third year in a row that the July average temperature record has been broken, with July 2025 closing out at 2.89C above the 1991-2020 average.In a similarly sweltering South Korea, Seoul had a record-breaking 22 consecutive “tropical nights”, a term used by the Korea Meteorological Administration when overnight temperatures fail to fall below 25C. On Thursday, the minimum overnight temperature in the capital was 29.3C.With August typically the hottest month of the year for both countries, fears are now growing for what may lie ahead. There is some respite on the horizon. Temperatures are expected to fall back to climate average by the weekend. However, long-term forecast models suggest that temperatures will trend above average throughout the latter part of August and into September. The summers of 2023 and 2024 were jointly the warmest recorded in Japan, while 2024 was one of South Korea’s warmest years overall – records that could fall by the end of 2025.Meanwhile, the start of August was unusually wet and chilly for parts of eastern Australia. Complex low pressure systems to the east of the continent brought frequent rain to New South Wales, with large swathes of the eastern coast recording 100-200mm since the start of the month – around double the August average. This moist air flowing in from the Tasman Sea collided with colder air already sitting over eastern Australia. The fallout was a rare significant snowfall event over higher ground in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland, where as much as 40cm fell in places – the heaviest for at least 20 years.While there was significant disruption, with more than 27,000 homes losing power and about 200 vehicles becoming stranded, the snowfall was a positive experience for many. “Snow tourists” flocked to affected areas from further afield to enjoy the rare winter wonderland, some of whom came to see snow for the first time in their lives.Explore more on these topicsJapanWeather trackerSouth KoreaExtreme heatAsia PacificanalysisShareReuse this content"

Initially, those would probably include Cathedral Cove/Te Whanganui-a-Hei, Tongariro Crossing, Milford Sound and Aoraki Mount Cook. The fees are likely to be imposed from 2027.The conservation minister, Tama Potaka, said those fees could generate NZ$62m a year “so we can keep investing in the sites that underpin so much of our tourism sector”.The government’s announcements form part of a wider shake-up of conservation law that will also make selling or exchanging conservation land easier and allow more activities to go ahead on conservation without needing a permit.“In the spirit of saying yes to more jobs, more growth and higher wages”, the government would “unleash a fresh wave of concessions” including in tourism, agriculture and infrastructure at some locations, the prime minister, Christopher Luxon, said on Saturday.Fast-track to where? The new law opening up New Zealand to a mining boomRead moreConservation land is protected, publicly owned land and makes up a third of New Zealand territory. It covers areas with biodiversity, historic or cultural value.Some businesses such as ski fields and grazing already operated on conservation land but many other businesses struggled to gain the same permission, Luxon said.It is the latest policy that seeks to loosen regulation on natural sites and species to enable economic growth. In 2024, the government passed a law that could seecontentious miningand infrastructure projects fast-tracked for approval. It has also proposed a law change to make it easier for companies to kill protected wildlife in order to pursue certain infrastructure projects.Conservation and climate initiativeshave also faced budget cuts.But critics say the changes risk harming the environment and vulnerable species. New Zealand has high rates of endemic biodiversity but some species are in worrying decline, witha high proportion threatened or at risk of extinction.Green party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said Luxon was putting profit above the protection of nature.“That tells us everything we need to know about who he thinks he works for. It’s not regular people, future generations or a healthy environment,” she said in a statement to the Guardian.Nicola Toki, the chief executive of New Zealand’s largest conservation organisation, Forest & Bird, said the latest reforms “represent the most significant weakening of conservation law in a generation” and would increase pressure on vulnerable species.“They shift the focus from protection to exploitation, dismantling the very purpose of our national parks and conservation lands.”This story was amended on 5 August 2025 to reflect new information provided by the government that fees will apply to Milford Sound, not Milford Track.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificConservationBiodiversitynewsShareReuse this content"

There were no discussions between the two militaries ahead of the decision, Lee said during a briefing.North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leadership and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong-un, didn’t immediately comment.Shortly after Lee took office in June, his administration switched off propaganda broadcasts criticising the North Korean regime as it looked to revive stalled dialogue with its neighbour.Pyongyang – which had reacted furiously to the hardline policies of Lee’s conservative predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol – has rebuffed recent overtures and said it had no interest in talking to South Korea.Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, said last week that Seoul’s “blind trust” in its alliance with the US and its hostility toward North Korea made it no different from Yoon’s administration.Her comments implied that North Korea – now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia over the war in Ukraine – feels no urgency to resume diplomacy with Seoul and Washington.Seoul resumed loudspeaker broadcasts in June 2024 after Pyongyang sentnearly a thousand rubbish-filled balloonsacross the border in the space of a few weeks. The broadcasts would “deliver messages of light and hope to the North Korean military and citizens”, the South said at the time.South Korea’s broadcasts were blasted from multiple speakers stacked in large racks and included world news and information about democratic and capitalist society with a mix of K-pop music. The sound is believed to travel more than 20km (12.4 miles) into North Korea.The cold war-style psychological warfare campaign further heightened tensions already inflamed by North Korea’s advancing nuclear program and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the US and trilateral security cooperation with Japan.The countries remain technically at war after the 1950-53 Korean war ended only in a truce, and relations have deteriorated in the last few years.With Reuters and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsSouth KoreaNorth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s been a sticking point.New South Wales police said initial estimates put the crowd at 90,000. A spokesperson for rally organisers, the Palestine Action Group, said police had informed them 100,000 people were in attendance – but the group estimated the figure was closer to 300,000.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Johnson also said it was the “most perilous” in his “35 years of policing”.View image in fullscreenThousands of protesters line streets before marching across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.Photograph: Dean Lewins/APHowever organisers estimated it was closer to 300,000.“It’s even bigger than my wildest dreams,” one of the main protest organisers, Josh Lees, said while at the front of the march at the midway point.Lees later said a number of people had come up with a similar figure after crunching the numbers based on widely shared aerial footage.What about an independent expert?Dr Aldo Raineri, a senior Central Queensland University lecturer and expert in crowd safety management, estimated the figure to be significantly higher than what police suggested.Guardian Australia shared drone footage with Raineri that showed the crowd just north of the bridge’s midway point, extending back to Wynyard station and Lang Park, where the march began.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe distance from Wynyard station up to where protesters began to be turned back is approximately 2.5km. The roadway along the bridge is 30 metres wide.Based on these dimensions and what appeared to be an occupancy of three or four people per square metre, he estimated between 225,000 and 300,000 people attended.However, he noted “these figures are really rough, given the variation in density”.Organisers said there were still people at Lang Park, who had not yet started to march, when police sent a message telling protesters to turn back.How does Sunday’s march compare with past marches?Lees said many who had gone to Sunday’s protest felt it was on par with past major protests they had been to, including the anti-Iraq war protest in 2003, which saw demonstrators march through the CBD, and the Walk for Reconciliation march in 2000 which went across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.According to the National Museum of Australia, about 250,000 people walked across the bridge in a continuous stream lasting nearly six hours during the reconciliation march. NMA called it the “largest political demonstration ever held in Australia”.In 2003, police estimated more than 200,000 took part in the anti-Iraq war rally, while organisers put the total at about 300,000, theSydney Morning Herald reported. The paper said it was “thought to be the biggest in the country’s history”.In 2023, an estimated 50,000 people took part in a march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge as part of WorldPride.View image in fullscreenThe wet weather didn’t prevent large numbers of protesters attending the rally.Photograph: David Gray/AFP/Getty ImagesChris Nash, who attended Sunday’s march, said it “felt much bigger” than the 2000 reconciliation march he also attended.“That was much more spaced out,” he said.The former NSW premier Bob Carr marched at the head of the pro-Palestine protest across the bridge. He was the premier during the reconciliation march in 2000.Asked how the crowd sizes compared, he said: “All that matters was that it was a big, beautiful success. A success with cheerful police cooperation and good-natured people motivated by the horror of Israel’s actions in Gaza.”How well did police handle the huge number of protesters?At about 3pm on Sunday, NSW police sent out a mass text message throughout the city ordering the pro-Palestine march to stop due to safety concerns, with authorities turning protesters around at the north end of the bridge.Police sent a second mass text message saying they had consulted with the organisers and were turning everyone around.“We could not get those people, the number, the significant size of that crowd off that northern egress route without risking crowd crush. We could not allow those numbers to then egress into the northern side, into those train stations without, again, that real risk of crowd crush,” McKenna told reporters. He said there were 1,000 police facilitating the protest.View image in fullscreenMounted police at the start of the March for Humanity across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPRaineri said allowing the crowd to amass without effective transport to disperse them would have been unsafe. He said the police went about this the right way by using mass text messages and consultating with protesters.However, some marchers toldLegal Observers NSWthey felt the “confusing and unplanned” directions from police were dangerous and could have caused a crowd crush.“Police had not adequately planned for the initial route to North Sydney and there did not appear to be a plan if crowd numbers exceeded expectations and made entering and leaving North Sydney difficult,” the group’s report on the protest said.Explore more on these topicsSydney Harbour BridgeSydneyProtestIsrael-Gaza warNew South WalesAustralian police and policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Between 1947 and 2019, the island had warmed by 0.7C, while the area covered by glacial ice fell from 289 sq km to 225 sq km.Australian volcano near Antarctica captured on satellite spewing lavaRead moreThe most dramatic changes were recorded on the island’s east, in particular on Stephenson glacier, which has retreated almost 6km since 1947. In the last 20 years, the glacier retreated on average 178 metres a year, the research, published last weekin the scientific journal the Cryosphere, found.“Glaciers are extremely sensitive to small changes in temperature,” said Prof Andrew Mackintosh, one of the paper’s authors and chief investigator at Monash University’s Securing Antarctica’s Environmental Future (SAEF). As the air warms, the melt rate increases and more snow falls as rain, Mackintosh said.“I’ve got no doubt the increase in temperature is primarily responsible for driving the glacier retreat. This shows that no place is free from the influence of climate change.”View image in fullscreen‘It is an absolutely mind-blowing place … with king penguins all around.’Photograph: Matt Curnock/Australian Antarctic Division/AFP/Getty ImagesView image in fullscreenA member of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition in 1948 surrounded by penguins.Photograph: Bettmann/Getty ImagesOn the neighbouring Laurens peninsula, where there are 11 small glaciers, the losses were even more dramatic. The 10.5 sq km of glacier ice that was there in 1947 was at just 2.2 sq km in 2019, the final year of data for the research.“One or two of those glaciers may have already disappeared now,” said Dr Levan Tielidze, the paper’s lead author and research fellow at SAEF.“They are small glaciers, but it’s a sign of what will happen in the future to the larger glaciers on Heard. These findings are a bellwether of change for our global climate system.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterSAEF is now using climate models to understand what could happen to the island’s glaciers in the future under different levels of greenhouse gas emissions.Mackintosh said: “Although this mapping shows stark glacier retreat and further ice loss is unavoidable, whether we retain glaciers or lose most of them entirely is up to humans and the greenhouse gas emission pathway we follow.“It might also mean the difference between a future where biodiversity is devastated, or one where key parts are secured.”loopPristine but vulnerableHeard Islandmade headlines earlier this yearwhen Donald Trump listed it as being subject to a 10% trade tariff, despite nobody actually living there.The pristine world heritage-listed island includes Australia’s only active volcano, Big Ben, and is a magnet for seabirds such as penguins, petrels and albatross, as well as elephant seals and unique slow-growing cushion plants.Dr Justine Shaw, an associate professor at SAEF with the Queensland University of Technology, visited the island in 2003.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

About 50 people a week are expected to be returned during the pilot of the so-called “one in, one out” scheme.The Home Office said the pilot was “operationally ready” and that detentions could start within days. The summer months, when the weather tends to be better, are usually the high point for crossings, with 898 arrivals on 30 July alone.Napier barracks to continue housing asylum seekers after small boat influxRead moreSince the start of the year, about 25,000 people have sought asylum by arriving on small boats across the Channel. The Conservatives have panned the scheme, saying the numbers arriving would mean it was the equivalent of “17 in, one out”.Nationalities at the greatest risk will be prioritised on the newly opened safe route and will be subject to full documentation and security and eligibility checks.The pilot scheme runs until June 2026, after which both the UK andFrancehave said they will assess its future.The final text of the deal was signed by the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, and her French counterpart, Bruno Retailleau, last week, and approved by the European Commission, which was thought to be a potential obstacle.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said the agreement was “the product of months of grownup diplomacy delivering real results for British people as we broker deals no government has been able to achieve and strike at the heart of these vile gangs’ business model.“The days of gimmicks and broken promises are over – we will restore order to our borders with the seriousness and competence the British people deserve.”Cooper said the government would robustly defend any legal challenge, saying it had learned from thefailed Rwanda deportation schemeunder the Conservatives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her life is in danger,” it said. The British embassy in Athens issued a similar statement.As Monday drew to a close, Greek officials said that no decision had yet been made about whether or not to continue the search-and-rescue operation on Tuesday.“Hope dies last,” said one. “Any scenario would be guessing at this point, and it is too early to make any decision.”Even if the coastguard operation was brought to a halt, the search would continue on land, and regular patrol boats would still comb the seas as part of their daily activities.Bourda is not the first Briton to go missing in Greece this summer. Last month, another silver alert was activated after the family of 60-year-old Jay Arnold notified police that he had vanished while holidaying on the southern Aegean isle of Karpathos.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police were alerted when he failed to check out of his room on the day he was due to leave. Though his rented car was found parked and locked, authorities have since described the search for him as “going cold”.“We’ve had dogs brought in, drones, specially trained police and volunteers out there looking and we’ve found nothing,” local police officer Panayiotis Fotopoulos said. “It’s very odd, a total mystery, that absolutely nothing should be found after so many weeks. We’re not ruling out that perhaps he fell into the sea.”Last June, the celebrity doctor and TV presenterMichael Mosley was found deadfive days after he went missing on the remote Greek island of Symi. An inquest determined he had likely died as a result of accidental heatstroke after getting lost as he attempted to return from the beach to his lodgings.With its crystal clear blue waters and golden sands, Ofrynio beach is among the most picturesque places in northern Greece, which, like the rest of the country, has been hit by record temperatures in recent weeks.Explore more on these topicsGreeceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Sorine Gotfredsen, a priest and journalist, wrote in the newspaper Berlingske: “Erecting a statue of a man’s hot dream of what a woman should look like is unlikely to promote many women’s acceptance of their own bodies.”Danish zoo asks pet owners to donate rabbits and horses to feed its predatorsRead moreShe added: “It’s truly uplifting that many find the statue vulgar, unpoetic, and undesirable, because we’re suffocating in overbearing bodies in public space.”The man behind the 14-tonne sculpture, Peter Bech, has said he does not understand the criticism, saying that the stone figure’s breasts are simply “of a proportional size” to its scale.Others have said the criticism reflects society’s attitudes to women’s bodies more generally – and not in a good way. For Aminata Corr Thrane, Berlingske’s debate editor, the scrutiny of the mermaid’s breasts was tantamount to body shaming.“Do naked female breasts have to have a specific academic shape and size to be allowed to appear in public?” she wrote.Noting that the Big Mermaid was “arguably a bit less naked” than her famed petite contemporary in bronze and granite, the Little Mermaid, Corr Thrane added: “On the other hand, she has bigger breasts, and that’s probably where the problem lies.”She added: “Perhaps the two statues – the Big and the Little Mermaid – represent two sides of woman, and the eternal tug of war about what arealwoman is. And perhaps even what a wrong woman is.”In 2006 the Big Mermaid was erected at Langelinie Pier in Copenhagen, near the Little Mermaid. But it was removed in 2018 after locals denounced it as “the fake and vulgar mermaid”.It was subsequently moved to Dragør Fort, until the Danish agency for palaces and culture intervened in March, requesting its removal. Dragør municipality has since reportedly declined Bech’s offer of donating it as a gift.Helle Barth, chair of Dragør muncipality’s climate, urban and business committee, told Berlingske that although it was a nice offer, “it’s just hard to fit in. It takes up a lot of space.”Bech, who has said he made the statue in response to tourists’ comments that the Little Mermaid – inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale – was too small, has said he is often told by people in Dragør that they love his sculpture. He is hoping to find a way to keep it in the town.The Danish agency for palaces and culture declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsDenmarkSculptureEuropeArtWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Industry associations said tens of thousands of jobs were at risk.Local media had reported that after three months of talks, negotiators believed they had secured a 10% tariff on exports to the US, a key market for Swiss products such as luxury watches, jewellery and chocolate but also machinery and pharmaceuticals.But after a 30-minute call with Keller-Sutter on Thursday evening variously described as “bad-tempered”, “disastrous” and “badly misjudged”, Trump imposed a levy even higher than the 31% he had announced on hisso-called “liberation day”in April.Trump tariffs explained: what’s changed and why have Asian countries been hit so hard?Read moreSwitzerland’s blue-chip stock market index opened 1.8% lower on Monday, the first day of trading since the tariff announcement on Swiss National Day, a public holiday. The cabinet said after an emergency meeting it would improve its offer to Trump.“Switzerland enters this new phase ready to present a more attractive offer, taking US concerns into account and seeking to ease the current tariff situation,” it said in a statement, without detailing what concrete proposals it might make.Swiss officials rejected reports that the 39% rate was imposed because of the call between Trump and Keller-Sutter, the finance minister and current president under the country’s rotating system. “The call was not a success,” a government source said.“There was not a good outcome for Switzerland. But there was not a quarrel. Trump made it clear from the very beginning that he had a completely different point of view, that 10% tariffs were not enough,” the source told Reuters.Swiss media were less forgiving. “Faced with Trump, Keller-Sutter was surely too naive,” wasthe headline in the tabloid Blick, while24 Heures saidwhat should have been her “masterpiece” ended up as “the heaviest defeat of her political career”.The rate would have a huge impact on Switzerland’s export-oriented economy and could spark a recession, said Hans Gersbach, an economist at ETH Zürich university, especially if pharmaceuticals, which are not covered, were included.Swiss companies, whose exports to the US account for about one-sixth of their total foreign sales, face one of the steepest US duties – only Laos, Myanmar and Syria had higher figures, at 40-41%. The EU and the UK negotiated 15% and 10% respectively.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Once we have that on the table, we can decide how to proceed.”Parmelin said Berne would move fast, revise its offer and “hope to achieve something” by 7 August, when the tariffs were due to come into effect. He and Keller-Sutter were ready to travel to Washington for further talks if necessary, he added.The business minister said Trump was focused on the US trade deficit with Switzerland, which was Sfr38.5bn (£35.8bn) last year. The country could offer to buy more US liquefied natural gas, as the EU had done, or Swiss companies could invest more in the US, he said.Keller-Sutter said on Friday that Berne would keep talking to Washington but there were only limited concessions it could offer, as US imports already enjoyed 99.3% free market access and multiple Swiss companies had invested heavily in the US.Analysts have said tariffs could still change at any moment because of the unpredictability of the Trump administration, with several suggesting their base case remained that Switzerland would eventually end up with a rate similar to that of the EU’s.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsSwitzerlandDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The wrinkles of concern in the economy are deepening again.”Financial markets are braced for Washington to introduce sweeping, higher “reciprocal” tariffs on imports from dozens of countries from the middle of this week, including Brazil on Wednesday and most other nations from Thursday.Share prices in Switzerland, which is facing a 39% export tariff from Thursday,plunged on Monday, as nations around the world continue to grapple with the fallout from Trump’s erratic global trade war.Financial markets elsewhere rallied, including in London, Frankfurt, and Paris, after a tariff-related sell-off at the end of last week.In tangled negotiations, with the threat of tariffs being withheld, escalated and rescinded on an almost daily basis, Washington remains locked in talks with several countries.A tariff of 40% on US imports from Brazil will begin on Wednesday, and will be topped up to 50% from Thursday.Canada is pushing for a deal to bring downtariffs of 35%on its exports, which was introduced from Friday, while US border taxes on imports from China and Mexico have been paused to allow more time for negotiations.The latest snapshot from Sentix showed sharp declines in investor confidence in Germany and Switzerland in particular after the agreement reached between Trump and von der Leyen at the US president’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The outlet said Johnson traveled with fellow Republican representatives Michael McCaul, Nathaniel Moran and Michael Cloud of Texas, and Claudia Tenney of New York.Johnson told Israeli settlers on Monday that Israel was the “rightful owner” of the contested Palestinian territory,according to a reportpublished on the pro-Palestinian website Common Dreams, and separately,Marc Zell, the chair of Republicans Overseas Israel.Common Dreams quoted Johnson as saying that “the mountains of Judea and Samaria are the rightful property of the Jewish people” and that the territory was at “the front line of the state of Israel, and must remain an integral part of it”.“Even if the world thinks otherwise, we stand with you,” he reportedly added, an apparent reference to recentproclamations by France and the UKthat they would recognize a Palestinian state if Israel did not commit to a ceasefire in Gaza.His visit was immediately condemned by the Palestinian foreign ministry, which issued a statement calling Israel’s annexation of theWest Banka “blatant violation of international law”.Johnson’s stance in support of the settlers, it said, “undermines Arab and American efforts to stop the war and [the] cycle of violence, while flagrantly contradicting the declared US position on settlements and settler violence”.Hundreds of ex-Israeli security officials urge Trump to help end war in GazaRead moreAccording to apost on Xby Zell, Johnson also said the US should use the 250th anniversary of its independence next year “to remind the American people of its Judeo-Christian foundations that were formed here in the land of Israel”.Johnson’s trip comes as pressure builds on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the growing hunger crisis in Gaza, which somecritics have called a genocideorchestrated by Israel.It also comes shortly after a Palestinian American from Floridawas killedin the West Bank by Israeli settlers while visiting family. The Trump-appointed ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, called the killing a “terrorist attack”.Johnson is expected to meet Netanyahu before returning to the US on Sunday.Explore more on these topicsRepublicansMike JohnsonUS foreign policyIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaWest BankUS CongressnewsShareReuse this content"

They are just two people who are travelling around the world.”He also renewed his criticism on Monday of the UK government, saying it felt as if ministers and officials were just going “through the motions” in their response.A Foreign Office spokesperson said it was “deeply concerned” at Iran’s espionage allegations and that it continues to raise the case “directly with the Iranian authorities”.“We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members,” she added.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s consul general in New Yorksaidthat there was “no deliberate starvation in Gaza, only a deliberate disinformation campaign orchestrated by Hamas”.Social media has also helpedspread misinformationabout hunger in Gaza, with photographs and video of cafes being presented as evidence that there is no famine.One Israeli creator on YouTube with more than 400,000 subscribers posted a video entitled “Summer 2025 (Genocide Never Tasted So Good)”, which highlights the existence of several small cafes in Gaza City in an attempt to disprove the existence of food shortages.‘No one should act surprised,’ says UN expert who warned of starvation in Gaza last yearRead moreBut Israeli government dataclearly shows that it is starving Gaza. UN-backed food security experts said that Gaza is currently experiencing a “worst-case scenario” famine. Even Netanyahu’s biggest ally, Donald Trump, has said there is “real starvation” in the territory.Despite such conclusions, pro-Israeli figures have continued to cast doubt on theveracity of imagesof malnourished children. In an interview with Piers Morgan, the US media personality Megyn Kelly dismissed such images as having been “manipulated”, before claiming that Hamas and “frankly a lot of Palestinians” are “masters of propaganda and they’re fine having their own children starve just as long as they can put them on camera”.Such attitudes are reflected in the comments under the Gaza cafes video, where a typical post reads: “It is hard to imagine that people can be so easily fooled into passionately believing the ‘genocide’ and ‘famine’ in Gaza when evidence against such false narratives is so readily available.”But while a small number of cafes are open in Gaza – including some of those in the video – they are operating in a severely limited capacity due to spiralling prices and scarcity of key ingredients, according to Salah Ahmad, the co-founder ofHopeHub, an organization that created co-working spaces for remote workers and students in cafes across the territory.Basic ingredients are hard to obtain, and prices fluctuate wildly from day to day: a kilo of flour can cost $12 one day, and $40 the next. Consequently, the small array of snacks these cafes are able to still offer are usually extremely expensive, Ahmad said.“When you see a small coffee shop or cafe selling drinks or cakes at high prices, it does not truly reflect the reality most people in Gaza are living,” Ahmad said. “In many cases, it is just a small business. The owners are simply trying to survive and feed their families with a sense of dignity.”Of the five cafes in the video, one was not currently open because they ran out of supplies, one said it was reopening after being shut down for several weeks because there were no supplies, and another said it was no longer selling food, Ahmad said.Often, cafes in Gaza remain open even when they do not offer food, as they provide internet connections and electricity from solar panels, Ahmad said. HopeHub is still operating two co-working spaces out of cafes – one in Khan Younis and one in Deir al-Balah.Further confusion has been created by the fact that some of the cafes are posting pictures and videos from before they closed down on. Hamada Ice Cream shop, which has not been open for weeks, recently posted a highlight reel of the pastries, cakes and drinks the cafe once served.“Me and 2 million Gazans are waiting for this moment Oh God, make things easy and these days pass safely, O Lord,” reads the video’s Arabic caption.The few cafes that are open are obviously not able to serve Gaza’s entire population, Ahmad said. “Most people in Gaza right now are poor and trying to survive,” he said.Those who do go to the cafes “might be employees who still receive salaries from international organizations, remote workers, or journalists”, he said. “They are holding on to hope, clinging to familiar routines, trying to stay connected to their memories of a more beautiful Gaza. For them, going out for a coffee is not about luxury. It is about staying human.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesSocial mediaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaFaminefeaturesShareReuse this content"

In a previous social media tirade last week, he said of Russia and India: “They can take their dead economies down together.”India to still buy oil from Russia despite Trump threats, say officialsRead moreAppearing on Fox News on Sunday at the weekend, his hardline deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, did not hold back as he took direct aim at India, stating that Trump had made it clear “it is not acceptable for India to continue financing this [Ukraine] war by purchasing the oil from Russia”.The whiplash the last few days have caused in the corridors of New Delhi is palpable. It was only February when India’s prime minister,Narendra Modi, was one of the first world leaders to be hosted by Trump and the two men embraced each other and hailed their “great friendship”. Indian officials were adamant that Russia had not even come up in trade negotiations until Trump’s public outburst.India had come to view the US as one of its strongest and most reliable partners, united by the bonhomie between its leaders and growing cooperation on everything from regional security and defence to bilateral trade, intelligence, technology and an increasingly powerful Indian diaspora in the US.A united geopolitical ambition to counterbalance the power of China had only brought them further together under recent presidents.Yet it did not go unnoticed by India that China – the other big buyer of sanctioned Russian oil, which also has leverage over the US in the form of rare earths – has not received similar threats, and neither has Turkey.Trump’s moves have been met with a frosty, if not outright defiant, reception among Indian officials. After Trump told reporters he had heard India would “no longer” be buying Russian oil,he was swiftly contradicted by Indian officials over the weekend, who said there would be no change in policy.View image in fullscreenNarendra Modi and Vladimir Putin at a Brics summit in 2024. ‘India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership,’ India’s foreign ministry spokesperson said.Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/ReutersUnder India’s “non-alignment” foreign policy it has maintained a close partnership with Russia over decades while strengthening ties with the US; a position largely tolerated by Washington and reiterated by Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, following Trump’s threats.“Our bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country,” said Jaiswal. “India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership.”In a column in the Indian Express, Shyam Saran, a former Indian foreign secretary, did not mince his words. “Donald Trump was supposed to be good for India in his second presidency,” he said. “He has turned out to be a nightmare.”Saran was among those who called for India to follow the example of China and Brazil and stand up to Trump. He insisted that although there would be “pain in resisting Trump … we should be prepared to endure it”.“Submitting to his exaggerated demands, which are now political as well as economic, would severely undermine India’s national interests,” said Saran. “We cannot give any country a veto over which countries India should or should not partner with.”It is widely agreed among analysts that Modi has been put in an unenviable position by Trump; either acquiesce to Trump’s demands and see loss of face domestically or reject them and face sky-high tariffs – and possibly other punitive actions – that would cripple the Indian economy.The Indian political scientist Pratap Bhanu Mehta said India was not the exception in mistakenly thinking that “Trump is purely transactional and that by placating him, pandering to his ego and giving him good headlines, it will be enough to make him quietly dial back”.One of the major sticking points for Modi, he said, was the highly public nature of Trump’s threats, which had complicated the possibility of backdoor negotiations over India quietly moving away from buying Russian oil and arms.He said Trump had already “frankly humiliated the Indian prime minister” over the recent India-Pakistan conflict in May, where Trump had publicly taken the credit for negotiating a ceasefire – a position vehemently denied by the Modi government in the aftermath.Trump’srecent embrace of Pakistan, signing deals with India’s enemy on cryptocurrency, mining and oil – and even having the chagrin to suggest India may one day buy Pakistani oil – as well as hosting the Pakistan army chief for lunch in the White House, had only added insult to injury.Mehta said suspicions towards the US in New Delhi now resembled those of 1971, when President Richard Nixon and his national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, sent warships to India in what is considered one of the lowest points of the US-India relationship. “The damage is already done,” said Mehta. “No matter what deal they come to now, distrust of the US is only going to continue to skyrocket.”Explore more on these topicsIndiaDonald TrumpNarendra ModiUS foreign policyRussiaUkraineOilanalysisShareReuse this content"

More than 200 people have already been arrested in response to the proscription last month.A Met police spokesperson said the organisers of Saturday’s planned protest are attempting to put the overcrowded criminal justice system under further pressure.“We are aware that the organisers of Saturday’s planned protest are encouraging hundreds of people to turn out with the intention of placing a strain on the police and the wider criminal justice system,” they said.“The Met is very experienced in dealing with large-scale protests, including where the protest activity crosses into criminality requiring arrests. Our officers will continue to apply the law in relation to Palestine Action as we have done since its proscription. Anyone showing support for the group can expect to be arrested.”Starmer’s official spokesperson urged people not to attend. “Any action that is in support of a proscribed group in the UK, of course we do not support and the court has confirmed their continued proscription status,” they said.“The home secretary previously said that those who seek to support this group may yet not know the true nature of this organisation, but people should be under no illusion this is not a peaceful or non-violent protest group.”Sadiq Khan, who was vocal in urging Starmer to recognise a Palestinian state, declined to weigh in. A spokesperson for the mayor of London said: “The policing of Saturday’s planned protest by Defend Our Juries is an operational decision for the Metropolitan police.”On Tuesday, a delegation organised by Jewish Voice for Labour will deliver a letter signed by 300 Jewish figures to No 10 and Cooper urging a lifting of the ban on the group.Also signed by the human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman KC and the playwright Gillian Slovo, it will express “horror” at the actions of Israel.The letter will say: “We consider the proscription of Palestine Action to be illegitimate and unethical. It is time to end the government’s hand-wringing over the level of slaughter and suffering in Gaza and the West Bank, mixed with tacit support to the Israeli state.The Met is sceptical of claims that thousands of people could turn up on Saturday. The force believes that a total in the low hundreds is more likely. Anyone arrested risks a terrorism conviction.At other events that led to mass arrests, the Met has arrested people, confirmed their identities and home addresses, and then quickly released them on bail so they could be dealt with later.Police resources will be stretched at the weekend as a large, separate pro-Palestinian march is also scheduled for Saturday and anti-immigration protests are expected.A spokesperson for Defend Our Juries denied any plot to overwhelm the police and the court system, as reported in the Telegraph on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are not the ones planning to ‘overwhelm’ the system,” they said. “If the Met exercises common sense and discretion and upholds its obligation to uphold the right of people to exercise their rights then nothing is being overwhelmed.“It is a difficult position for Sir Mark Rowley [the Metropolitan police commissioner] to be in. Based on what has happened on previous occasions it would be surprising if no one is arrested but on the other [hand] everyone is going to be doing the same thing and it will be a challenge to arrest more than 500 people given that we think there are about 520 available police cells in London at any one time.”They believed Rowley would be factoring in last week’s high court ruling giving permission to the co-founder of Palestine Action to bring a legal challenge to the home secretary’s decision to ban the group.Other forces exercised discretion not to arrest people at similar protests in Derry, Edinburgh and elsewhere, they added.The protests would take place regularly in future, they said, adding that it was becoming “a badge of honour” to be arrested.Defend Our Juries has held discussions with MPs about taking part but there was a reluctance on the basis of concerns it could lead to suspension from parliament.About 40 pro-Palestine protesters gathered outside the Labour party headquarters on Monday evening.Campaigners held Palestine flags and chanted “Shame on Keir Starmer, shame on the Labour party, shame on David Lammy” while banging steel pot lids outside the office in Southwark, London.One sign displayed by the group read “We support the legal application to de-proscribe Palestine Action. Fight racism. Fight imperialism.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The criminal justice system will always be ready to deal with sudden surges coming through the courts.”The Home Office did not respond to questions about the planned protest.Explore more on these topicsProtestMichael RosenMike LeighMetropolitan policeLondonIsrael-Gaza warPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

Ken McCallum, its current chief, said she was “the first avowed female head of any intelligence agency in the world” and praised her for breaking “through longstanding barriers”. She was, he added: “A visible example of the importance of diversity in leadership.”Dame Stella Rimington obituaryRead moreAn accidental spy, recruited in the mid-1960s as a typist when her husband, John, was posted to India on diplomatic service, Rimington rose through the ranks to end up as chief of the Security Service between 1992 and 1996.After her appointment as director general, she was the first chief of the agency to be named, although no photograph was supplied at first and the only image available was a blurry picture of her in the street wearing a distinctive raincoat.“I’m proud that I was the first woman DG and that, during the time I was there, MI5 changed from being an old-fashioned closet organisation,” she said in aninterview in 2011as she reflected on her secret career.In her first interview after leaving the agency in 2001,with the Guardian, Rimington said she was drawn to the world of espionage despite the fact that when she started at the agency “there were all of these tweedy guys with pipes”.“I still thought the essence of the cold war and spies and stuff was fun. You know, going around listening to people’s telephones and opening their mail and stuff,” she added, though she also conceded MI5 was “overenthusiastic” during the cold war.Rimington held roles in MI5 units tackling counter-subversion, counter-espionage and counter-terrorism, and she acknowledged that MI5 was involved in assessing threats to national security posed by leaders of the miners’ strike in 1984-85.She was also involved in debriefing the star British agentOleg Gordievskyafter he was extracted from the Soviet Union by MI6 in the mid-1980s. Gordievskysaid laterhe “liked her as a woman immensely”, though Rimington said in a documentary she was unaware of the romantic impression she had made on the defector.During her time as MI5’s director general she oversaw an agency making a wider transition from tackling the cold war threat to terrorism, and was the first agency chief to give a public lecture to the BBC.View image in fullscreenRimington turned to writing after leaving MI5, including her autobiography, Open Secret, published in 2001.Photograph: Dan Chung/Reuters“I have set out in this lecture to show that a security service such as MI5 is compatible with personal liberty within our democracy,” she said. Such was her profile, she was considered a model for Judi Dench’s portrayal of M, the fictional chief of sister agency MI6, in a series of James Bond movies.After leaving MI5, Rimington principally became a writer. Her first book was a memoir, Open Secret, published in 2001, though there was a furious row about her decision to write an autobiography at the time. Particular objections came from the SAS, and she was ordered to remove all references to the elite special forces.A series of novels followed, eight with Liz Carlyle, an MI5 officer as the lead character, and two more with Manon Tyler, a CIA agent. In one of her books, Rip Tide, published in 2011, she sent up American officials who imagined that al-Qaida could be bombed into submission.“I’m tweaking the Americans’ tails,” she said, having previously argued in 2009 the US had “gone too far with Guantánamo and the tortures” in an interview with a Spanish newspaper.Born as Stella Whitehouse in 1935, she moved from London to Barrow-in-Furness aged four, and remembered the port town being repeatedly bombed during the war. She married John Rimington in 1963 and they had two daughters, but the couple separated in 1984.Rimington and her husband never divorced, however, and she and John became friends again later in life, living together during the Covid lockdown. “Yes, we argued, but we’ve mellowed. It’s a good recipe for marriage, I’d say: split up, live separately, and return to it later,” she said.Explore more on these topicsMI5UK security and counter-terrorismCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

Police are understood to be treating him as a victim, not a suspect, at this stage. Police have said he was admitted to hospital “with serious injuries which are not thought to be life-threatening”.CCTV from the busy central London station has been recovered and studied by detectives. Robinson had been leafleting at the station earlier, and on the video can be heard saying “he come at me”.Robinson is a former leader of the extreme-right English Defence League. The far-right monitoring group Hope Not Hate describes him as the “best-known far-right extremist in Britain”.Police believe he left Britain shortly after a video was put online showing him near the injured man.The video does not show how the injured man came to be lying motionless on the floor.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

That person was arrested at the scene, she said.The event was billed on social media as an unofficial afterparty for Hard Summer, a weekend festival for house and techno music that took place in Hollywood Park by SoFi stadium, which is located in Inglewood in south LA, theLos Angeles Times reported.LAPD received reports of shots fired at the afterparty around 1am on Sunday, after officers had cleared the area.

The award was based on a recommendation from a “special committee” of the board.The announcement in afinancial filingwas accompanied by a shareholder letter from two members of the committee, Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chair, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson.It described the award as a “good faith” payment to Musk after the previous pay deal, worth $56bn, was rescinded in 2024 by a judge in Delaware, where the company was incorporated until June that year.“To recognise what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value he delivered toTeslaand our shareholders, we believe we must take action to honour the bargain that was struck in 2018,” the directors wrote. “After all, ‘a deal is a deal’.”Denholm and Wilson-Thompson said they had reviewed investors’ letters and posts on X – the social media network owned by Musk – and acknowledged concerns about his focus on his job.“From those communications, we know that one of your top concerns is keeping Elon’s energies focused on Tesla,” they wrote. “This award is a critical first step toward achieving that goal.”As well as running Tesla, Musk also owns the SpaceX rocket company, the social media platform X, the artificial intelligence company xAI and the brain implant business Neuralink. He has also made forays into Republican politics, damaging the Tesla brand and sales andraising concerns among shareholders.Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities and one of the most prominent voices of concern aboutMusk’s political travails, said the award would remove an overhang – a surplus of availability – on Tesla shares, increasing prices.“Musk remains Tesla’s big asset,” Ives said.The award is worth about $29bn based on Friday’s closing share price. Musk is worth $350bn, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index.Over the past year, Musk has become embroiled in US politics and a political relationship with Donald Trump that turned toxic after the president entered the White House for the second time, a feat assisted by the Tesla chief executive’s financial and personal support.The furoreput off left-leaning Tesla buyersinside and outside the US, thoughcompetition in the electric car markethas also affected sales.A survey from the research firm S&P Global Mobility shared with Reuters showed that Tesla’s customer loyalty has plunged since Musk endorsed Trump. It found 49.9% of Tesla-owning households in the market for a new car bought another Tesla last March. This was just below the industry average, but was down from 73% in June 2024. It edged back up to 57.4% in May this year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has said he wants greater control over the company to avoid being ousted by “activist shareholders”. The company is shifting its focus to robotaxis and humanoid robots, in a move that positions Tesla more as an artificial intelligence and robotics firm than a carmaker.“While we recognise Elon’s business ventures, interests and other potential demands on his time and attention are extensive and wide-ranging … we are confident that this award will incentivise Elon to remain at Tesla,” wrote the directors.The award is designed to increase gradually Musk’s voting power, something he and shareholders had consistently said was key to keeping him focused on Tesla’s mission, the directors added.If the 2018 package is reinstated in full following an appeal to the Delaware courts, the new package will be forfeited.Tesla shares, which have fallen nearly 20% so far this year, rose more than 3% in early trading.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskExecutive pay and bonusesTeslanewsShareReuse this content"

The National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, a Trump appointee, has claimed “all over the US government, there have been people who have been resisting Trump everywhere they can,” in justifying the firing.Friends of BLS, a group chaired by former BLS commissioners Erica Groshen, an Obama appointee, and William Beach, Trump’s appointee during his first term, strongly criticized the firing of McEntarfer, Trump’s allegations, and called on Congress to act.“We call on Congress to respond immediately, to investigate the factors that led to Commissioner McEntarfer’s removal, to strongly urge the Commissioner’s continued service, and ensure that the nonpartisan integrity of the position is retained,” Friends of BLS wrote in astatement. “This rationale for firing Dr McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers.”The Association of Public Data Users, theNational Association for Business Economicsand theAmerican Economic Associationalso criticized the firing.“Under the law, disliking the data is not a qualifying reason to remove the BLS Commissioner from her four-year appointment. Under our democracy, it is unacceptable to fire someone for publishing data collected in accordance with scientific standards,” the Association of Public Data Users said in astatement, echoing the call for Congress “to respond immediately, to investigate the factors that led to Commissioner McEntarfer’s removal, to strongly urge the BLS Commissioner’s continued service, and ensure that the nonpartisan integrity of the position is retained.”Beach added in a social mediapost: “the totally groundless firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, my successor as Commissioner of Labor Statistics at BLS, sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the Bureau.”Beach wasnominatedby Trump as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2017, was confirmed by the Senate in 2019 and served a full four year term until 2023.In an email, former BLS commissioner Kathleen Utgoff, who was appointed and served under the George W Bush administration, told the Guardian: “A functioning democracy requires accurate data so that workers, businesses, politicians and voters can make good decisions. I was at the BLS after the Iraq war. Many people asked me how to create something like the BLS there. They could not move forward without data on the state of the economy.”Republican US senators Rand Paul, Thom Tillis, Cynthia Lummis have alsoquestioned the rationale behindTrump’s firing of BLS commissioner McEntarfer.The last jobsreportissued by BLS before the presidential election in November 2024 showed the US only added 12,000 jobs in October 2024, the slowest growth since 2020.Explore more on these topicsUS unemployment and employment statisticsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The offer also kept current overtime policies, which Boeing had proposed modifying in the last contract offer.The offer was largely the same as the first offer that was overwhelmingly rejected one week earlier.Boeing has said that if the contract offer had been approved, the average annual wage would have risen to $102,600 – up from $75,000.Dan Gillian, Boeing Air Dominance’s vice-president and general manager and a senior St Louis site executive,told the St Louis Business Journal: “We’re disappointed our employees rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth and resolved their primary issue on alternative work schedules. We are prepared for a strike and have fully implemented our contingency plan to ensure our non-striking workforce can continue supporting our customers.”The workers assemble Boeing’s fighter jets and the MQ-25, an aerial refueling drone being developed for the US navy.Thisisthe first strike that Boeing has faced at its St Louis defense hub since 1996.Boeing’s defense division is expanding manufacturing facilities in the St Louis area for the new US Air Force fighter, the F-47, after it won the contract this year.Boeing’s CEO, Kelly Ortberg, said last week that the planned strike would be much smaller than that of the 30,000-worker strike last ​year, when the company took a $661m charge on its KC-46 tanker development contract with the US air force.“We’ll manage through this,” Ortberg said during an earnings call. “I wouldn’t worry too much about the implications of the strike.”Boeing currently holds contracts for several major Defense Department programs,according to Defense News, including the air force’s F-47 and F-15EX fighters, T-7 training jet and the Air Force One recapitalization effort.Explore more on these topicsUS newsBoeingMissouriUS unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Job growth numbers were revised down by 285,000 for the two previous months as well.On CBS News’s Face the Nation, GreerdefendedTrump’s decision to fire McEntarfer, a respected statistician, saying: “You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.”He added: “The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch.”Senate confirms Trump ally Jeanine Pirro as top federal prosecutor for DCRead moreBut William Beach, who served as Trump’s commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in his first presidency, warned that McEntarfer’s dismissal would undermine confidence in the quality of US economic data.The BLS gave no reason for the revised data but noted that “monthly revisions result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors”.“This is damaging,” Beach said on Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union. “I don’t know that there’s any grounds at all for this firing.“And it really hurts the statistical system. It undermines credibility in BLS.”McEntarfer on Friday published a statement on social media reacting to her dismissal, calling it the “honor my life” to have served as BLS commissioner.She said the BLS employed “many dedicated civil servants tasked with measuring a vast and dynamic economy”.“It is vital and important work, and I thank them for their service to this nation,” McEntarfer’s statement on the Bluesky platform said.Uproarover McEntarfer’s firing has come as a series of newtariff ratesare due to come into effect this month. While the president has predicted a golden age for the US economy, many economists warn that higher import tariffs could ultimately weaken American economic activity.On CBS, Greer said that Trump’s tariff rates were “pretty much set” and unlikely to be renegotiated before they come into effect.The first six months of Trump’s second terms have been characterized by a seesawing of tariff rate announcements that earned the president the moniker on Wall Street ofTaco– “Trump always chickens out”. But last week heissuedanexecutive orderoutlining tariff modifications for dozens of countries after he had twice delayed implementation.Yet Greer also said many of the tariff rates announced “are set rates pursuant to deals”.“Some of these deals are announced, some are not, others depend on the level of the trade deficit or surplus we may have with the country,” he said.On NBC’s Meet the Press, the national economic council (NEC) director, Kevin Hassett, said modified US tariff rates were now “more or less locked in, although there will have to be some dancing around the edges about exactly what we mean when we do this or that”.Asked if tariff rates could change again, he said, “I would rule it out because these are the final deals.”Hassett said that the president and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, are in the process of finding a replacement for Jerome Powell, whose term as Federal Reserve chairman is coming to an end next year.Hassett demurred when asked if he would accept the position, saying Trump and Bessent were “going to go through a list of names. And I’m sure the president will pick the best available person.“We’ll have to see if he chooses me,” he added, noting that he’d been working with Trump for eight years as one of his closest economic advisers. “Of course, we’ve talked about the Federal Reserve,” he said.On Fox News Sunday, Hassett said he also supported McEntarfer’s dismissal. “I think what we need is a fresh set of eyes at the BLS, somebody who can clean this thing up,” he remarked.But former treasury secretary Larry Summers told ABC’s This Week that McEntarfer’s firing was “way beyond anything that Richard Nixon ever did”, alluding to the late former president who resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal.Trump news at a glance: inquiry launched into Trump prosecutor as backlash grows over firing of statistics chiefRead moreSummers said Trump’s claim that the poor job numbers were “phoney” and designed to make him look bad “is a preposterous charge”.“These numbers are put together by teams of literally hundreds of people following detailed procedures that are in manuals,” Summers said. “There’s no conceivable way that the head of the BLS could have manipulated this number. The numbers are in line with what we’re seeing from all kinds of private sector sources.”Summers placed McEntarfer’s firing, Trump’spressureon Powell to lower interest rates, and the strong-arm tactics that the administration has aimed at universities, law firms and media institutions in the same bucket.“This is the stuff of democracies giving way to authoritarianism,” Summers said. “Firing statisticians goes with threatening the heads of newspapers.“It goes with launching assaults on universities. It goes with launching assaults on law firms that defend clients that the elected boss finds uncongenial. This is really scary stuff.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS economyTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is likely to play a significant role in the company’s plan to increase its oil and gas production to between 2.3m to 2.5m barrels of oil equivalent a day.The company said on Monday it had also started a new oil extension project in the Gulf of Mexico that should add an extra 20,000 barrels a day to its production. The Argos project would be the first in a series of new projects in the Gulf between now and the end of the decade.BP has returned its focus to fossil fuels in recent years after abandoning itsfailed plan to cut its hydrocarbon production, which had favoured expanding in low-carbon energy alternatives, such as offshore wind.Gordon Birrell, the head of BP’s oil and gas production business, said the discovery was “another success in what has been an exceptional year so far” which had underscored the company’s “commitment to growing our upstream” oil and gas production.He added that Brazil was an important country for BP, which will explore the potential of establishing “a material and advantaged production hub in the country”.The Santos basin, which is in coastal waters off Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, is BP’s second discovery in Brazil this year. The group has also announced oil and gas discoveries in Trinidad, Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico, Libya, Namibia and Angola, in a marked retreat from its former green agenda.The company’s plan to become a “net zero” energy company has faceda string of unforeseen hurdlessince it was put in motion inearly 2020.The Covid-19 pandemic triggered one of its worst financial results – a $5.7bn loss for 2020 – since it reported a $4.9bn loss for 2010 following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In 2022, it was forced totake a $25bn hitafter offloading its stake in the Russian oil company Rosneft after the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.While the company invested heavily in the offshore wind industry, which has suffered increasing costs in recent years, its rivals were able to exploit the surge in fossil fuel prices after the Russian invasion by pumping more oil and gas.BP, which announces its half-year results on Tuesday, said last month that it would sell its share in 10 US onshore windfarms to the New York-headquartered LS Power. On Monday it launched its 50:50 offshore wind joint venture with the Japanese wind company Jera worth up to £4.5bn, which it plans to use to gain some access to zero-carbon wind energy developments while focusing on fossil fuels.Amid BP’s floundering net zero strategy, its former chief executive Bernard Looney was sacked from the company for failing to disclose to the board his relationships with his staff.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The move means Opec+ has now fully reversed its largest tranche of output cuts, made as oil demand slumped after the Covid-19 pandemic.The oil price was down 2% on Monday, with Brent at just over $68 a barrel.Explore more on these topicsBPOilOil and gas companiesEnergy industryBrazilFossil fuelsCommoditiesnewsShareReuse this content"

There was jawing, the shove and, then, Lyles turning around, backpedaling, reaching his arms out and bouncing up and down like a boxer before lobbing a few more choice words at Bednarek.Their argument bled into the post-race interview.“I tell ya, if you’ve got a problem, I expect a call,” Bednarek said, as NBC’s Lewis Johnson moved the mic between the runners.Lyles replied: “You know what, you’re right. You’re right. Let’s talk after this.”Though they shook hands during the interview, Bednarek was fired up well after the sprinters had left the track.“The summary is, don’t do that to me,” he said. “I don’t do any of that stuff. It’s not good character right there. That’s pretty much it. At the end of the day, he won the race. I’ve got to give him props. He was the better man today.”The win itself was no big surprise for Lyles, the three-time defending world champion who will have to get past Bednarek to make it four in a row in Tokyo. Bednarek was asked what Lyles said as he turned around and gloated after securing his fifth national title at his favorite distance.“What he said didn’t matter, it’s just what he did,” Bednarek said. “Unsportsmanlike … and I don’t deal with that. It’s a respect factor. He’s fresh. Last time we lined it up, I beat him, that’s all I can say. Next time we line up, I’m going to win. That’s all that matters.”Asked to expand on his role in the tiff, Lyles was less forthcoming: “On coach’s orders, no comment.”Bednarek has won silver and beaten Lyles the last two times they’ve lined up in the 200m at the Olympics, even though Lyles has had issues at both – in Tokyo with his mental health,then in Paris with Covid.Bednarek referenced some long-simmering issues between the two. “Just some personal stuff we’ve got to handle,” he said.When asked to expand on his rivalry with Bednarek, Lyles demurred, instead focusing on what a difficult year this has been for him after an injury in April kept him out of spikes until June.“If they ain’t gonna beat me now, they ain’t gonna beat me ever,” Lyles said.Bednarek wasn’t so sure. The 200m final was Bednarek’s fifth race of the week, counting the three heats of the 100m, where he won the final on Friday. Lyles, who has an automatic spot at worlds in that event as the defending champion, only ran one heat of the 100m.“We’ll go fresh and we’ll see what happens,” Bednarek said. “Because I’m very confident I can beat him. That’s all I can say.”Explore more on these topicsNoah LylesAthleticsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rio Ngumoha further enhanced his first‑team claims with a sparkling display against Athletic Bilbao that underlined the formidable strength, and options, available to Arne Slot.Ngumoha opened the scoring superbly and teed up a goal for Darwin Núñez inside five minutes at Anfield in the first of two pre-season friendlies against the Basque club.Liverpool’s ‘take it or leave it’ £110m bid for Alexander Isak rejected by NewcastleRead moreA packed Anfield crowd had to wait for the second fixture to catch a first glimpse of new signings Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Ekitiké and Jeremie Frimpong. Ngumoha kept them entertained before then as Liverpool recorded a comfortable 4-1 win in match one. The second game also went Liverpool’s way, a 3-2 victory in which Wirtz, Ekitiké and Frimpong added to the flowing, blistering quality of the champions’ attacking play.Ngumoha is not eligible to sign a professional contract until he turns 17 on the 29th of this month but showed why Chelsea were livid when Liverpool tempted him away from their academy last summer. In only the second minute of his second senior appearance at Anfield the teenager, who made his full debut against Accrington Stanley in the FA Cup last season, set off from halfway and, with Athletic defenders all in retreat, curled an excellent finish into the bottom corner of the Kop goal from 20 yards.The left winger produced something similar in Liverpool’s previous pre‑season outing against Yokohama F Marinos last week. That goal came on the dayLuis Díaz completed his £65.5m transfer to Bayern Munich, creating an opening on the left that could be filled by any one of Cody Gakpo, Wirtz, Ekitiké and perhaps the 16-year-old talent from London. His display was enough to prompt chants of “Rio” from the Kop and a song in his honour from the singer who appeared during the interval.Ngumoha’s emergence – predicted with confidence by John Terry when he lamented the youngster’s exit from Chelsea – is timely for Liverpool as they await Newcastle’s next move on Alexander Isak. There may not be a rush to replace Díaz directly given the options already at Slot’s disposal. The Premier League champions can afford to wait on their prime target for the No 9 role and leave their £110m offer for Isak on Newcastle’s table.View image in fullscreenA Liverpool fan holds up a scarf in tribute for Diogo Jota.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAThree minutes after his individual goal Ngumoha headed down a Ben Doak cross for Núñez to convert from close range. Anyone looking for clues as to Núñez’s next step – with Al-Hilal interested in taking him to the Saudi Pro League – will have noted the hand-on-the-heart celebration that followed from the £60m-rated Uruguay international in front of the Kop. A glimpse of Liverpool’s past and future, perhaps. Doak and Harvey Elliott, two other players who could leave Anfield in this window, were also on the scoresheet in the first contest against Ernesto Valverde’s side. Ngumoha’s footwork and pace also impressed in the 67 minutes he was on the pitch. He received a well-earned rousing reception when replaced by Trent Koné-Doherty.The opening game started at 5pm as scheduled despite supporters in the Main Stand having to be evacuated just over an hour before kick-off due to a false alarm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There were moving moments 20 minutes into both games when everyone inside the stadium rose to their feet to applaud Liverpool’s No 20. Play stopped and players from both teams also joined in the applause for Jota and Silva.Slot was without Virgil van Dijk for both Bilbao games due to illness. The Liverpool head coach indicated the club captain could be a doubt for Sunday’s Community Shield against Crystal Palace. Conor Bradley and Joe Gomez were also absent through injury, forcing Slot to deploy 18-year-old midfielder Trey Nyoni in central defence for the first Bilbao contest and Luca Stephenson at right-back.Goalkeeper Alisson was unavailable having left Liverpool’s recent pre‑season tour of Asia due to personal reasons. Summer signings Freddie Woodman and Armin Pecsi filled in, playing one half each, while Georgia international Mamardashvili made his Anfield bow in the second game behind a central defence of Ibrahima Konaté and Wataru Endo. That is one department where the champions appear light at present. Ngumoha could add to their riches up front.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He has not only been quick in the best car on the grid, but consistent and calm. This has not been the stuff of fireworks, but relentless precision. His execution and attitude have no little of the Alain Prost about them and he is shaping up to be a similarly formidable opponent as The Professor.He has gone toe to toe with his teammate, Lando Norris, in these opening 14 meetings and, overall, come out on top. There have been six wins and only twice has he failed to reach the podium. The three consummate victories in a row inBahrain,Saudi ArabiaandMiamimade his title ambitions clear, while errors have been few and far between. A spin in the wet in Australia and a safety car infringement at Silverstone are the only blots on an otherwise immaculate copybook.Next bestLando NorrisEntered the season as favourite and when the McLaren duly proved to be the class of the field was expected to exploit it. However, aftera strong start in Australiait became clear the MCL39 was not quite giving him the feel for the front grip of the car that he likes. It proved costly, particularly in qualifying, and Norris was typically forthright and honest that it was up to him to adapt.Errors compounded his problems, not least crashing in qualifying in Saudi Arabia and hitting his teammate in Canada. In Budapest, he revealed an intriguingly nihilist approach, noting in regards to the title race: “In 200 years no one is going to care. We’ll all be dead.”Rather than settling down to contemplate the meaninglessness of existence in a darkened room the Briton has doggedly stuck at his task and returned some impressive wins with fine drives inMonacoandAustriaand aninspired strategy coup on Sunday in Budapest. If he can eliminate the faults Norris will be challenging his teammate to the end.Room for improvementMax VerstappenBefore the weekend began in Hungary,Verstappen ended speculation over his futureby stating he would be with Red Bull next year, but did not say whether he would see out his contract that runs to 2028.The world champion has acknowledged the title is beyond him this year, but he still craves performance and stability within the team. However, over these 14 races, the form of the car has been sorely lacking, while bringing an end to the turbulence of the past two years and soothing the ruffled brows of the Verstappen camp was at least part of the purpose of theremoval of Red Bull’s team principal of 20 years, Christian Horner.View image in fullscreenVictory at Suzuka in the Japanese Grand Prix was a rare high point in an otherwise disappointing first half of the season for Max Verstappen.Photograph: Issei Kato/ReutersVerstappen has still succeeded in wrestling repeated results, including two impressive wins, from a car that is barely manageable, but he and the team’s focus is now on the future. There are major exams coming up in the form of the new regulations for next season and, for the second half of this one, the question that will dominate is how doRed Bullunder their new boss, Laurent Mekies, now adapt? If the Frenchman fails to deliver, the internal politicking at the team could be fascinating. And brutal.Best newcomerGabriel BortoletoWhen Sauber brought in a new floor in Spain the 20-year-old Brazilian rookie came alive, showing promise given his team’s relatively uncompetitive car. He is in good company in the new intake.At Racing Bulls, Isack Hadjar has been a standout adapting quickly to F1 with consistent, confident performances and largely outdriving his teammate, Liam Lawson, whom Red Bull had rated enough to promote, briefly, to the senior squad at the start of the season. Kimi Antonelli has demonstrated his potential at Mercedes, but has been inconsistent in a car George Russell muscledto a win in Canada.Bortoleto has given the impression he may have so much more to come. After Sauber applied upgrades in Barcelona, Bortoleto took his first points in Austria including challenging Fernando Alonso for seventh place. A crash at Silverstone followed while on slicks in the wet, but he took points in Belgium and in Hungary he was flying. He qualified seventh, 12 places in front of his experienced teammate, Nico Hülkenberg, and claimed sixth in the race after a battling drive. If he can repeat it in the second half of the season, Audi, as Sauber will be next season, have a genuine asset.Earned a holidayLewis HamiltonLeft dejected after two races of, by his own admission, below-par performances – with 16th on the grid in Spa and a 12th in qualifying in Hungary he describedas “absolutely useless”before finishing the race in 12th – Lewis Hamilton even appeared to cast doubt on his future in F1.It was a response, likely a blip, from a driver worn down by having to deal with adapting to his new team under such scrutiny as well as dissatisfaction at how they, and he, are performing. It is unusual for Hamilton to be so publicly hard on himself and perhaps represents real frustration withFerrari, but he has proved repeatedly he is nothing if not a fighter.A step back after what has been a gruelling opening with a new team is clearly required even if, as is believed, he feels there is still enormous work to be done at the Scuderia. Hamilton accepted the process to adapt would take time, but that frustration in Hungary suggests he could be disillusioned despite his belief Ferrari have everything needed to return to the top.He said rather dejectedly in Budapest he would “hopefully” return after the summer break. The touch is still there, as he proved in Silverstone and Spa, but he, perhaps like no other driver, could benefit from a reset over the summer break.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneOscar PiastriLando NorrisMax VerstappenLewis HamiltonFerrariRed BullfeaturesShareReuse this content"

France’s flagship daily sports newspaper, emblazoned with an image of a yellow-clad Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, arms outstretched and triumphant, with the banner headlineGeante,had almost sold out.Ferrand-Prévot, thefirst French rider to win the Tour de France Femmes, has become a national icon almost overnight. After her Paris 2024 gold medal performance in mountain biking and the Paris‑Roubaix win this spring, Ferrand-Prévot fever has taken over. Cycling’s slumbering giant has finally awoken.Mascots, dogs, and cogs: the Tour de France Femmes 2025 – in picturesRead moreAs a little girl, Ferrand-Prévot asked her mother why it was that she couldn’t race in the Tour de France. “But it’s a men’s race,” came the response. “I wish I was a boy,” the nine-year-old Pauline said.The French have waited a long time to see one of their own in the yellow jersey – 36 years in women’s racing and 40 in men’s – and endured decades of humiliation plus an ingrained sense of inferiority, usually to multiple foreign champions, some of them doped.During that time, there have been other misfiring women’s tours of France, but none of them compare with the significance and scale of the modernTour de France Femmes, which Christian Prudhomme, race director of the men’s Tour and initially sceptical of the women’s race, now sees as equal in stature.For archivists, the last French rider in yellow was Jeannie Longo, who won the Tour de France Féminin in 1989, although that race did not compare with the investment, difficulty and global importance of the modern Tour Femmes.Justifiably, Ferrand-Prévot has been depicted as the successor to Bernard Hinault, the last French winner of the men’s Tour. The celebratory televised phone call from President Macron, within minutes of her victory in Châtel, is evidence of that.Ferrand-Prévot’s Olympic gold came while she was sponsored by Ineos Grenadiers, but their reluctance to invest further in women’s racing led to her off‑season move to the Visma Lease-a-bike team, and a vow to win the Tour within three years. Jim Ratcliffe’s loss has become the Dutch sponsor’s gain.For the French, this was equivalent to England men’s long‑awaited home Ashes win in 2005, or Andy Murray’s breakthrough British Wimbledon victory in 2013. The 33-year-old may well have uncorked fresh ambition within the host nation, and not just in women’s racing.Compare Tadej Pogacar’s muted celebrations afterwinning his fourth Tour de Francea week ago in Paris with the party vibe in Châtel late on Sunday evening and the differences between the men’s and women’s Tour are far greater than just of gender.In stark contrast, there is an openness, joy and freedom of expression to the Tour de France Femmes that puts the monastic and secretive world of its occasionally lumbering male counterpart to shame.View image in fullscreenPauline Ferrand-Prévot celebrates as she crosses the finish line to win the final stage and the race.Photograph: Jean-Christophe Bott/EPAFerrand-Prévot came to the Tour Femmes parchment thin, compared to the rider who powered to victory over the cobbles of Paris-Roubaix in April. The dramatic weight loss enhanced her power-to-weight ratio, but it doesn’t look good and she has readily acknowledged it.“I don’t want to stay like this, because I know it’s not 100% healthy,” she said on Sunday evening, “but we also had a good plan with the nutritionist in the team and everything is in control. I didn’t do anything extreme, and I still had power left after nine days of racing. It’s a tricky subject, because you have to find the limit. I also know that I can’t stay like this forever. It’s the choice I made.”The already lean Demi Vollering, second overall in Châtel, an athlete who has openly talked about teenage mental health and menstrual cycles, also faced questions on whether she would now seek to lose weight to become more competitive.“I could lose weight too, but I don’t want to be extremely thin,” she said. “I’m proud of my weight and want to set a good example. I hope that in the future I can win again and show girls that you don’t have to be super skinny, but that you can also win with hard work and power.“I know that many others struggle with this, so I hope that young girls don’t think they have to be super skinny to ride in the mountains.”Kasia Niewiadoma, the outgoing champion, highlighted the fast-track development in ability within the women’s peloton and said that her own level was “definitely higher” than that of a year ago.“This is the growth of women’s cycling,” she said after finishing third. “I think that the teams are stronger. You can see that a lot of teams have grown in depth – they have really strong riders who can help their leaders.”Of course, the Tour Femmes is not perfect. As the pressure to perform grows along with the rewards, it will inevitably develop some of the same ethical issues that confront men’s racing. But, right now it is refreshing, joyous, dramatic and exciting, with a growing roster of accomplished athletes.“Watch The Femmes” say the caps tossed to the crowds from the publicity caravan. “We don’t need the men any more to exist,” the race director Marion Rousse said earlier this summer after announcing the move to stand‑alone dates for the Femmes in 2026. Rousse is right. Maybe we have been watching the wrong race all along.Explore more on these topicsTour de France FemmesCyclingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Kevin C Cox/Premier League/Getty Images for Premier LeagueHaving lost key players at the back, it appears Bournemouth’s buy-low sell-high model will be tested if they are to again challenge for a European placeByBen FisherMon 4 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 19.33 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:10th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:9thBournemouth kitsProspectsThree months ago,Bournemouthwon at Arsenal for the first time to maintain their hopes of qualifying for Europe with three games to go. It was an impressive comeback victory built on set pieces, Dean Huijsen heading the equaliser from Antoine Semenyo’s long throw – cue the Chill Guy meme celebration – before Evanilson poked in a scruffy but well-worked winner from a corner.Bournemouth came up short in their quest to play in Europe as a positive season fizzled out after three wins from their final 15 matches. And now three of their back five from that day have departed –Huijsen for Real Madrid, Milos Kerkez for Liverpool and Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was on loan from Chelsea, for Arsenal. The expectation is that Illia Zabarnyi will become the next high-profile exit, with Paris Saint-Germain pushing to sign the 22-year-old.The fact Bournemouth sold Huijsen to Real in a £50m deal after a single season and 36 appearances serves as a reminder of the club’s journey across the last decade, and their continued eye for smart business. The thing worth remembering is that while it appears Bournemouth have been decimated, those on the inside recognise this is how their buy-low, sell-high model works. The downside is the breakup of a brilliant, buccaneering defence.Whether Bournemouth can cope with a flurry of key departures remains to be seen but this summer they moved to find a permanent goalkeeping solution in Djordje Petrovic, a £25m signing from Chelsea. Finding a commanding No 1 capable of holding down the position had been a priority after acknowledging the stability rival clubs had gained from making similar moves. Petrovic, who shone on loan at Strasbourg last season, would appear a solid platform on which to build. But for a team that operated with a thin squad last season, it is impossible to shake the sense that starting over represents a daunting task.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerAndoni Iraola led Bournemouth to 56 points last season, their record tally in the top flight, as they finished ninth, equalling their best finish. His appointment two years ago, driven by the now Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes, has proved a masterstroke and last term enhanced the reputation of Iraola, the definition of a hands-on coach, among rivals. The 43-year-old is into the final 12 months of his contract and while he prefers working on rolling contracts, another extension is up in the air. Iraola, who does a good line in self-deprecation, is a self-confessed fidget: he clicks a multi-colour pen throughout interviews and tapes over some of his fingers for superstitious reasons. “It’s stupid,” he said. “But I have done it for so many years that I continue doing it.”Off-field pictureBournemouth’s 80-year-old billionaire owner, Bill Foley, flew from the US in April to formally open the club’s £35m state-of-the-art training complex and on the same visit he shared another welcome nugget: he has agreed a deal to buy their Vitality Stadium home, allowing Bournemouth to expand its capacity to about 20,000. The Cherries have been locked into an onerous lease with the property company Structadene, which bought the ground in 2005, then known as Dean Court, for £3.5m, a deal that helped the club avoid administration. Foley – via his Black Knight consortium – added the Portuguese club Moreirense to his stable, which includes investments in Lorient, Hibernian and Auckland FC.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Adrien Truffert has the tools to be a breakout star in the Premier League. Bournemouth sealed the signing of the 23-year-old Belgium-born left-back for an initial £11.4m from Rennes, a fee the Cherries – and some of their top-flight rivals who have tracked the full-back – regard a snip given his profile. Truffert, capped once by France in 2022, was captain of Rennes and made his 150th Ligue 1 appearance in May. Perhaps it is a quirk of fate that as a toddler he lived in Bournemouth for a year with his family.View image in fullscreenAdrien Truffert of Bournemouth tussles with West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen during the Premier League Summer Series.Photograph: Todd Kirkland/Premier League/Getty ImagesStepping upDaniel Adu-Adjei spent the first half of last season on loan at the bottom of League Two, scoring two goals in 17 appearances for relegated Carlisle, so it would be quite the jump if he is involved. The 20-year-old striker, born in Hammersmith to Ghanaian parents, has impressed in pre-season, scoring against Everton, and trained regularly with the first team at the beginning of this year. His father, William, regards Tony Yeboah as one of his closest friends, while Daniel is studying a nutrition course funded by the Professional Footballers’ Association, his go-to dish a BBQ pulled chicken burger. “At Carlisle, I lived by myself and had to cook all my dinners so I learned a lot,” he said.A big season for …Few players had as satisfying a summer as Alex Scott. Even an awkward face mask, the result of a fractured jaw sustained against Aston Villa in May, could not dampen his spirits. Scott starred for England as Lee Carsley’s under-21s won the European Championship in Slovakia, starting all five matches, though he was forced off through injury in the final. Bournemouth paid Bristol City £25m to sign Scott two years ago but his progress has been stop-start and he began only eight matches last season, largely owing to a lengthy knee injury. Scott, 22 this month, is a throwback midfielder, a cute passer with an endearing appetite to get his hands dirty. Everybody is craving to see more of his talent.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26BournemouthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The receptionist at Uefa’s headquarters in Nyon looked bemused when presented with a suitcase full of fake bank notes last month by members of theCrystal Palacesupporters’ group. They claimed it represented the “contradictions of their supposed ‘fundamental values’ of integrity and fairness and the reality of their business methods and general conduct”.Uefa has said it followed the correct procedures after its club financial control body demotedPalace from the Europa League to the Conference Leaguebecause they were deemed to have broken multi-club ownership rules. But for the HF, it was a call to arms.‘It’s not fair’: Crystal Palace fans march in protest at demotion from Europa LeagueRead more“For a situation like this, where we and our family members feel there is something unjust happening to the club, we have to act quickly,” says Mickey Grafton, a founder member who also helped organisea protest outside Selhurst Parka week earlier attended by hundreds of fans.An HF delegation, having also delivered a letter to Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, demanding the club’s reinstatement into the Europa League, headed to the headquarters of the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne, where Palace’s appeal against their demotion will be heard on Friday. The result is due the following Monday. “The protests against those responsible will continue,” the HF said.Palace have been drawn to play in the Conference League playoff round against the losers of the Europa League tie between Fredrikstad of Norway and Denmark’s Midtjylland, with the first leg scheduled for Selhurst Park on 21 August.Officially formed in 2005, the HF has grown into one of most influential supporters’ groups in the country after playing a leading role in protests outside the headquarters of Lloyds Bank in 2010 when Palace were facing liquidation after being placed in administration.The hand-painted tifos they produced forlast season’s FA Cup semi-finalagainst Aston Villa andthe final against Manchester City– which it proudly emphasised involved at least 120 group members and were funded by fans – caught the eye of the wider football world. One depicted two young supporters celebrating a Darren Ambrose winner at Old Trafford in 2011 with their late father and the message: “Wembley will shake and it will be beautiful”.Anyone who has attended a Palace game at Selhurst Park or on the road in recent years will attest to the frenzied atmosphere created by the black-shirted group, who are not afraid to do things differently and take their inspiration from Europe’s ‘Ultra’ culture.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Holmesdale Fanatics on their way to Nyon.Photograph: Courtesy of Holmesdale Fanatics“It’s a huge collective – that’s what English football has lacked if you compare it to the rest of the continent and beyond,” Grafton says. “It doesn’t have organised fan groups and as a result fans lose out. If you have organisation, you can have unity and through unity you can stop things like this happening. You can stop injustices and you can stand up for the values that made football so attractive to people. [If] constant profit and greed is pushed above all else then you end up in the state of the game in England today, which is not pretty.”This takes a great deal of planning, with Grafton saying he and some of the group’s other main organisers are “very close to being sacked every day”. He says: “It comes at an expense. It becomes your life and you’re willing to do that for a football club because there are these values in modern life we think are worth preserving.

Themes like identity and belonging that so many people would find very normal around the world or in the past of this country are somewhat lacking. The football club and this group gives that in abundance. Those are partly our motivations.”Parish blames Nottingham Forest for Crystal Palace’s Europa League demotionRead morePrevious HF banners have criticised the Premier League’s decision to permit Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment fundto buy a majority stake in Newcastleand taken aim at the increasing number of early kick-offs. They have also never been afraid to call out issues on their own doorstep. In January 2023, when the then co-owner John Textor completed his purchase of Lyon – a move that appears to have cost Palace their place in the Europa League – a banner said: “Multi-club ownership. Stock market gambling. Textor, we don’t trust you”.“I would say that over the last 15 years, the Palace fanbase have gathered around issues of protest,” says Grafton. “The culture of Palace has changed. We’ve grown up with ideas about football as the group has grown. The social aspect around football is almost as important as football itself and if football loses that or it’s allowed to be discarded, then it’s just 11 blokes on each team kicking a ball around.”There has been little sign of other Premier League clubs following the HF’s example although there is an emerging Ultras scene in Scotland. “English football culture is stagnating,” says Grafton. “There’s nothing happening on the terraces and there hasn’t been for 25 years. It’s time for change. But it has to be grassroots-led. Too many teams in the Premier League are imitating it from a boardroom level – a COO will give the green light to a printed banner that gets put in the ground for them to hold up. What we do is totally different.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceUefafeaturesShareReuse this content"

A degree of relief for West Ham, who beat Bournemouth to finish second in the competition despite all the gloomy prognostications about their campaign to come. In Seoul, meanwhile, there was a very Tottenham moment as they followed the glee of last week’s 1-0 win over Arsenal with a 1-1 draw against Newcastle in which James Maddison was stretchered off with a knee injury described by his manager Thomas Frank as “bad”.It all looks real, it sounds real and yet everybody knows it isn’t real. That even now, in this age of data and minute analysis, there remains an element of randomness, is one of soccer’s great joys as a sport. But that tendency is magnified in pre-season.Tottenham fans will only appreciate me when I am gone, says Daniel LevyRead moreThe Premier League has been away for 10 weeks now. For those hooked on its soap opera, the wait is intolerable. The Club World Cup, the England men’s team being dreadful in June as they so often are, the Under-21s continuing their unfamiliar excellence, even the women’s Euros … none of it quite offers the same hit. Obsessing over transfers suffices only for so long; eventually there is a need to see them play.And so there are pre-season games, and there is is analysis. The best of it is skeptical, acknowledging the absurdity of making judgements on 45 minutes. The worst of it is breathlessly insistent – of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, the two senior players United have managed to sign, appearing together against Everton. What does it mean that Rasmus Højlund was only on the bench? Does that mean Benjamin Šeško is more likely to sign? The front three, with Mbeumo dropping deep and Cunha and Bruno Fernandes at times running beyond him, looked fluent. Fernandes and Mbuemo set up Amad Diallo, overlapping from wing-back to score the opener. This is the way Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-3 is supposed to work.In that, at least, there is a sense of something tangible, a United that is, at last, able to execute their manager’s attacking plan. But Ayden Heaven’s own goal was a reminder that United remain as self-destructive as ever. Perhaps more significant was the equaliser conceded after Manuel Ugarte lost possession, the lack of urgency to get back. Did this happen because it was only a friendly and United are nowhere near peak fitness yet? Or because this is an irredeemably feckless bunch of players?This is smoke on a foggy day. Will any of it be relevant when the season begins for real? United fans will remember ruefully just how good they looked in pre-season under Louis van Gaal in 2014, only for the season itself to prove anticlimactic.The problem with assessing pre-season games is that different sides are at different stages of readiness. Some expect to hit the ground running from week one; others are building to peak in March or April, the differences magnified two weeks before the opening day. Some managers are working on specific plans and are less bothered by the whole, some are just hoping to get semi-competitive minutes into their players’ legs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The stories are legion: the Everton winger Peter Beagrie driving a motorbike through a plateglass window in San Sebastián; Sunderland’s diminutive but extremely tough full-back John Kay terrifying a much larger local who had threatened him by casually eating the antiseptic cubes from a urinal in Bristol; Arsenal’s French midfielder Gilles Grimandi joining five of his English teammates on a night out in Switzerland where the first round comprised 35 pints of lager and a dry white wine. Many managers, you suspect, would quite relish a return to the days, if not of booze, then at least of pre-season being a largely private affair rather than a projection of the club to the world.Very occasionally something consequential happens, such as Chelsea conceding four in the second half to an experimental New York Red Bulls led by Jesse Marsch in the summer of 2015, the first sign that something had gone badly wrong for José Mourinho’s side since winning the Premier League two months earlier; within five months, Mourinho had been sacked. (It was also the debut first-team appearance for Bournemouth and US national team midfielder Tyler Adams, then 16 years old.)Pre-season is very much the phoney war, the jockeying, the probing. It matters to the clubs, but to outsiders it is essentially like watching an artist mix his paints. There’s anticipation and a vague technical interest, but it means nothing until it starts being applied to the canvas.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

There were memorable trips to Berne, Bruges, Leipzig, Paris and Monaco as Unai Emery’s side enjoyed an absorbing ride to the Champions League quarter-finals, and nobody of a claret-and-blue persuasion will forget thehome triumph over Bayern Munichanytime soon. Then there was the run to the FA Cup semi-finals, though acomprehensive defeat to Crystal Palaceat Wembley delivered a sting.There were plenty of positives, chiefly the continued emergence of Morgan Rogers, now one of the Premier League’s most coveted players, and the consistent class of Youri Tielemans behind him in midfield, and yet it was a campaign tinged with disappointment. Villa missed out on qualifying for Europe’s elite competition on goal difference afterdefeat at Manchester Unitedon the final day and Emery’s hunt for silverware – he outlined his desire to win a trophy on arrival in Birmingham almost three years ago – goes on. Villa imploding in the Europa Conference League semi-finals two years ago, losing 6-2 on aggregate to Olympiakos, hurt but now Emery returns to a competition that he knows best: the Europa League.Villa have been transformed under Emery but is there room to grow? Except the arrival of Marco Bizot from Brest, the 34-year-old goalkeeper signed as a No 2, Villa are yet to sharpen their squad, even if the Dutchman appears a smart buy given they paid a six-figure fee. They lost out to Manchester City in the race of Sverre Nypan and were primed to move for the Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who is now poised to join Paris Saint-Germain, if a club met the asking price for Emiliano Martínez.Improving a strong squad is not straightforward, especially in the era of profitability and sustainability rules. Villa’s spine – spearheaded by Ollie Watkins – matches that of most division rivals; Harry Kane is the only Englishman to register more goals and assists in Europe’s top five leagues across the past five seasons.They begin the season at home to Newcastle, another team hamstrung by financial parameters, and have a seemingly kind start, facing only Eddie Howe’s side and Brentford from last season’s top 10 before the October international break. The warning sign is Villa flew out of the blocks last season – losing only one of their first 13 matches – but a hectic schedule punished them.Past five seasonsThe manager“I’m like a robot,” Emery said at the end of last season, describing his laser-focus at training. The 53-year-old is demanding of himself, staff and players, a football obsessive inspired by the methods of teams as grand as PSG and as modest as FC Andorra. It is not uncommon for him to study clips on the exercise bike or make notes on the rowing machine but his workaholic nature has led him to read books to control his emotions. Emery is the majority shareholder of fourth-tier Real Unión, the Basque club for whom his father, Juan, and grandfather, Antonio, played. His pièce de résistance remains his success in the Europa League – he has won iton four occasions– and this season he has the chance to make it five.Off-field picturePerhaps the most important piece of business was the move to sell the women’s team to help comply with the league’s profitability and sustainability regulations. The sale of a key player such as Martínez would liberate them in the market but Villa are under no pressure to sell prized assets. This summer Francesco Calvo, previously of Juventus, replaced Chris Heck as the president of business operations, with Calvo’s long-term aim to “make the club successful 360 degrees”. That helps explain the increase in season-ticket prices, the North Stand redevelopment which will take Villa Park’s capacity north of 50,000, the chain of concerts, including Black Sabbath last month, and news that the stadium will host Premiership rugby next March.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 25-year-old, persuaded to join Villa in 2022 by the then manager, Steven Gerrard, after leaving his hometown club Marseille on a free, is one of Emery’s key cogs. He missed the start of last season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury but is ready to hit the ground running this time. Emery views Kamara as indispensable and him staying put is a huge boost.View image in fullscreenBoubacar Kamara is back fully fit after missing a chunk of last season with an knee injury.Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty ImagesStepping upIt will be interesting to see if Zépiqueno Redmond, the forward whose name is supposedly inspired by the protagonist of the Brazilian film City of God, can make a mark. The 19-year-old started for Feyenoord at the San Siro in February, en route to the Champions League last 16, but departed the Eredivisie club as a free agent, presenting Villa with an opportunity they felt was too good to pass up. Redmond scored twice against England at the European Under-19 Championship and while he missed the pre-season trip to the US through injury, he could prove a wildcard with Emery thin on strikers. The 18-year-old midfielder Jamaldeen Jimoh-Aloba – part of the FA Youth Cup-winning team last season – did go on the pre-season tour.A big season for ...The end of last season was rather strange for Donyell Malen. Villa finally got their man when the flying Dutchman, on the books of Arsenal as a youngster, landed from Borussia Dortmund in January. Villa tried and failed to sign him the previous season but the carrot of the Champions League convinced him of the £20m move, having been defeated in the competition’s showpiece six months earlier. Malen arrived but, 12 days later, with Uefa’s registration deadline looming, Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were preferred to him and he was left out of Villa’s European squad. Malen scored in three successive Premier League wins in April but was limited to two top-flight starts, both before that goalscoring run. Surely more opportunities await.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Aston VillafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Justice for Players foundation, a Dutch group that has the former England assistant manager Franco Baldini on its board, has served notice of its intention to file a class action against Fifa and the football associations of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.Justice for Players is seeking compensation on behalf of players who have lost income because of Fifa’s transfer rules since 2002. It says the legal case will involve about 100,000 players.Fifa’s transfer rules go against European Union law, declares EU’s highest courtRead moreThe claim will be filed in the district court of Midden Nederland, with the Netherlands chosen as the jurisdiction because Dutch law permits claims from anyone who has worked within the European Union and the United Kingdom.The Football Association is understood to have been sent a copy of the letter before action. Although not named as a defendant, it could be added later. Fifa and the five domestic FAs have been given until September to respond.The compensation claim is the result of the CJEU judgment last Octoberin the case brought by former Chelsea and France midfielder Lassana Diarra, who sued Fifa after the world governing body refused to issue him with an international transfer certificate (ITC) to join the Belgian club Charleroi in 2016 after he was found to have breached his contract with Lokomotiv Moscow two years earlier.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Fifa fined Diarra €10.5m and suspended him from football for 15 months for breaching his contract, in a ruling upheld on appeal at the court of arbitration for sport.

Fifa has amended its transfer regulations, although the new rules have not been accepted by the international players’ union, Fifpro.The Justice for Players foundation is understood to have been set up this year with the intention of bringing a mass legal action.Diarra’s lawyer, Jean-Louis Dupont, who won the landmark case at the CJEU on behalf of Jean-Marc Bosman that established the principle of free movement for players out of contract, in 1995, is advising Justice for Players.The legal letter sent to Fifa makes reference to the class action being a multibillion claim. This figure is understood to be based on independent analysis from economists at Compass Lexecon, who have estimated that players would have earned about 8% more over their careers since 2002 had Fifa’s transfer regulations not been unlawfully restrictive.The CJEU judgment ruled that Fifa’s regulations restricted free movement by establishing unlawful criteria for determining compensation to be paid by a player who breaks their contract, allowing the national federation of the former club to withhold a player’s ITC, making the player’s new club liable for the compensation to be paid to the former club and allowing Fifa to impose disciplinary sanctions on the player and their new club.Fifa has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsFootballFifaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

But on Sunday in Seoul,during a pre-season friendlybetween the Bigger Vase champions and Newcastle, there was scarcely a dry eye in the house as Tottenham and their South Korean supporters’ branch bade an emotional farewell to a player who, over the past decade, has to all intents and purposes become Mr Tottenham. Substituted after 65 minutes of the 1-1 draw, an emotional Son Heung-min received warm hugs and a guard of honour from both his teammates and the players of Newcastle before retiring to the substitutes’ bench for a little weep. After 10 years of service, one of the most popular, high-performance and low-maintenance players to ever grace the Premier League is off to ply his trade in MLS with LAFC and an English football landscape so often synonymous with spittle-flecked and snarling rage will be considerably poorer for the absence of histrademark beatific beam.“I didn’t think I was going to cry at first but after hearing a few words from my teammates, leaving the club I’ve spent so much time with felt really tough,” he sobbed. “I felt really, really happy playing this match. Thanks to my fans, my teammates and also my opponents, I’ve had an unforgettable day. My career is not over yet, and I want to continue to bring joy. I know I have more things I want to accomplish as a football player.” In his 454 appearances for Spurs, the man they call Son accomplished plenty. He scored 173 goals and provided 101 assists but such metrics don’t come even close to measuring his contribution to the club’s cause. On the pitch a graceful, lightning fast predator with the cold eye of an assassin, Son lifted Tottenham’s first trophy in 16 years last season and at other points during his time in north London, won a Puskás Award and shared a golden boot.Tottenham fans will only appreciate me when I am gone, says Daniel LevyRead moreIn arguably his greatest act of personal selflessness for the benefit of the greater Tottenham Hotspur good, he also made a complete dog’s breakfast ofthatone-on-one with Manchester City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to deny Arsenal the title two seasons ago. Off the pitch, it has long been apparent that Son is that rare breed of elite footballer who few people, except perhaps Arsenal fans in whose collective side he has been a constant thorn, has a bad word to say about. Among those shedding salty tears in Seoul was Ben Davies, the similarly long-serving Spurs player who is so close to the departing South Korean that – try saying this without slurring after a skinful – his son is Son’s godson. “I saw my good friend Ben Davies cry,” said Son in the post-match interview. “Seeing him tearing up with his eyes going all red made me feel sorry and thankful at the same time. A mixture of feelings really but as the godfather of his son, I need to strive for more, to make my godson proud.”While Son’s rigid adherence to his duties as a moral guardian are to be commended, Football Daily is prepared to wager that as long as he remembers to pony up the obligatory readies each and every birthday, Davies Jr is unlikely to give two hoots whether or not he ever kicks a football again. “Sonny is Tottenham and Tottenham is Sonny,” declared James Maddison before the friendly, a game in which the midfielder was carried off the field on a stretcher after suffering abad case of knee-knack. “It’s weird to think about Tottenham Hotspur without Son.” For those who continue to pass in and out of the gates of the Spurs training complex, it will also be weird not to see the small gaggle of South Koreans who regularly convene on the Enfield outskirts hoping to get a smile, a kind word or a selfie as Son comes and goes from training. Exceedingly rare were the days, by all accounts, when the subject of their unbridled adoration failed to oblige them.QUOTE OF THE DAYWe didn’t want to finish [our USA USA USA tour] in this way.

The former Adelaide champion, who led the club to the drought-breaking 2021 flag, was let go following just seven wins this season, with Troy Chaplin confirmed as the interim replacement.Taking over from Paul Roos in a succession plan for the 2017 season, Goodwin led Melbourne to their first premiership in 57 years. But off-field turmoil and dwindling performances on the field placed the 48-year-old’s job in jeopardy.Brisbane Lions put horror show behind them to thrive on the big stage | Jonathan HornRead moreWhile the pressure on Goodwin had been building for some time, the timing of his axing was ultimately a surprise. The Demons outclassed West Coast by 83 points on Saturday and Goodwin was optimistic when speaking to the media afterwards.“I’ve got a clear plan, I’m well supported by the board in terms of where we’re heading and what we’re trying to achieve, and they also understand that sometimes when you’re building something, that challenge will occur and what happens is you ride the challenge, you have clarity, and you keep building,” he said.The club is currently being overseen by interim chief executive David Chippindall before Paul Guerra, the current CEO of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce, takes over next month.Demons president Brad Green said Goodwin should be “incredibly proud of what he’s achieved at the Melbourne Football Club”.“To take a group of players and help shape them into a premiership team is something only four otherAFLcoaches have achieved within the history of the club,” Green said in a statement.“He has given absolutely everything, not just as a coach, but as a person and we are extremely grateful for his contribution to the red and blue. While decisions like this are never easy, the board and I believe that now is the right time for a new voice to lead our AFL playing group and program forward.”Former Demons captain Garry Lyon said he was “absolutely stunned” by the decision.“I thought that there would be a long review at the end of this year and then determine whether he coached out his final year [of his contract],” he told radio station SEN.“Premiership coaches are pretty rare at the Melbourne footy club, he’s one of four, he will be a hero of this football club forever and a day, but that obviously doesn’t guarantee your tenure, and this is a massive call.”Goodwin has been a target of online vitriol in recent weeks, including an apparent death threat, and the AFL provided additional security at Marvel Stadium on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFrom the Pocket: AFL WeeklyFree weekly newsletterJonathan Horn brings expert analysis on the week's biggest AFL storiesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Petchey’s TV commitments meant he was always unable to become Raducanu’s full-time coach and after a trial with Roig following Wimbledon, the 22-year-old will begin work with him in Cincinnati this week. He has agreed a contract until the end of 2025.Emma Raducanu knocked out of Canadian Open in straight sets loss to Amanda AnisimovaRead moreRaducanu has struggled to settle with a coach in recent years until her part-time work with Petchey started to pay dividends earlier this season. A WTA 1000 quarter-final showing at the Miami Open in March was followed by a last-16 run at the Italian Open before she made the last eight in the first women’s tournament at Queen’s Club.Aryna Sabalenka proved too strong for Raducanuin round three at Wimbledon, but this was backed up by a semi-final at the Citi Open as the British No 1 targets being seeded at the US Open later this month. Petchey, who worked with Andy Murray at the start of his career, revealed in July that Raducanu would need to find a full-time coach soon and she has found that in Roig.The Spanish coach worked with Nadal alongside Nadal’s uncle Toni for most of the 22-time grand slam champion’s career and more recently was part of Matteo Berrettini’s backroom staff.Raducanu will stay close to Petchey but turns her focus back to rising up the WTA rankings with a strong display at the Cincinnati Open over the next fortnight.Djokovic pulls out of Cincinnati OpenNovak Djokovic is set to enter the US Open without playing in any warm-up tournaments after he pulled out of the Cincinnati Open.Djokovic has not played since acomprehensive straight-sets loss to Jannik Sinnerin the Wimbledon semi-finals on 11 July.The 24-time grand slam champion struggled with a left thigh injury during his one-sided defeat at the All England Club and after he missed the Toronto Masters, the Serbian will now sit out another ATP 1000 event in the shape of the Cincinnati Open.After being included on the original acceptance list, an updated version on Monday showed Djokovic as a withdrawal.

It was never going to be a question for him to go out there. He was in a lot of discomfort even running between the wickets.England and injured Woakes denied as India win fifth Test thriller to draw seriesRead more“But we’ve had Rishabh Pant go out to bat with a broken foot, we’ve had Shoaib Bashir bowling, batting and fielding with a broken finger and then we had Chris go out there and try and get his team over the line with a quite recently dislocated shoulder.“Before he went out I didn’t get a chance to give him a tap on the back and say: ‘Go well.’ Coming off it’s obvious what would have been said, just: ‘Great effort, unbelievable.’ He just shrugged his shoulder and said: ‘I wouldn’t do anything else.’”Stokes, who wasruled out of the gamewith a shoulder injury of his own, pinpointed whenWoakes went down on the opening dayas the moment that decided the match – “It took, I don’t know, half a ­second for a shoulder to pop out and ­everything just completely changed for us there” – but the ­captain ­admitted that the six catches ­England dropped ­during India’s ­second innings had not helped.“You could say those chances we put down did cost us, but back to Headingley where we chased down those runs, India dropped quite a few chances and that probably did ­contribute to us winning. Maybe if we did hold on to those chances, things could have been a little bit different.”Though the game ended in defeat in the adversity of playing most of it a man down, Stokes felt certain players ­demonstrated pre­viously unknown courage. “Some guys will leave this series having found out a lot more about themselves,” he said.“In particular, with Woakesy going down early on, the responsibility that fell on Gus ­Atkinson, Josh Tongue and Jamie Overton’s shoulders – their roles ­completely changed from why they were selected, the impact we thought they would have on the game. They had to dig deep. I think a couple of guys have found out more about themselves in a very, very ­positive way.View image in fullscreenThe two captains, Ben Stokes (left) and Shubman Gill, shake hands at the trophy presentation.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“They took that ­responsibility on without adding pressure to ­themselves. They did that in a way of pride – one of the boys has gone down and we’re going to have to take on that workload. Some people would shy away from that and be worried about what it means for them. They showed a lot of courage, a lot of heart. They can be very proud of the way they threw themselves into that.”After an appropriately, brutally tense conclusion on its 25th day the series will be remembered as a ­classic, with Stokes admitting the final scoreline of 2-2 was “probably fair”. He said: “There’s that disappointment and frustration, not to have got the result that gives us the series win, but this series has been fantastic to be a part of.“It’s been full of ups and downs, ebbs and flows, throughout every game. India have been in control, we’ve been in control, it’s gone back to them and then it’s come back to us. To be a part of it has been pretty ­special.“There is still that ­disappointment, but for the wider game, and we want to constantly be promoting the game, this series has been great.”Bacon rashers, hi-vis jackets and a dog collar: all life is found among Oval early birdsRead moreAt the end of his first series as India’s captain, to which he contri­buted 754 runs and four centuries, Shubman Gill said its – and his own – vacillating fortunes had ­demonstrated “how the game of life works”.He said: “There are moments like this where you feel the journey is worth it. There’ve been a lot of highs and lows and that’s kind of expected in sport.“Every time you go into bat you want to perform, you want to score a century, but that’s not how the game of life works. You should be able to navigate through the highs and lows of life and stay balanced. I want to stay balanced whether we’ve won the match, lost the match, I’ve done well or not well.“This morning summarised what this team’s all about. The way Brook and Root were going [on Sunday], not many teams in the world would have given themselves a chance, but this team believes that whenever we have an opening we can get through that opening.“That’s what we were saying once Brook was out – this was our opening and you never know.”Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Ben StokesEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s fantastic for the local ­community – the employment we’re creating because of this stadium. The fact that other clubs are now trying to copy what we’re doing, that should be a sign that maybe we did do something bold and something right.”TheEuropa League triumph last seasonwas Spurs’ first trophy since 2008 and came just before the end of a Premier League campaign when they finished 17th after a record 22 defeats. Levysacked Ange ­Postecoglou16 days after the win against Manchester United in the final in Bilbao and he is hopeful that Frank can help the club to challenge for trophies on a more consistent basis.“Whenever you appoint a coach, you always believe it’s right,” Levy said. “You need a lot of ­ingredients for it to be right. Thomas is a highly intelligent individual, a ­fantastic way about him in terms of communication.“He will be great at ­developing young players and older players and making them better. He gets the style of football we want to play. We haven’t said to him: ‘You’ve got to win the league this year.’ We just want to compete at the highest level.”Levy was critical of the Premier League for the time it has taken to conclude the case involving alleged breaches of the league’s regulations by Manchester City. The club, who deny wrongdoing, were charged in ­February 2023with more than 130 breaches.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For Ben Earl, you sense it did not take as long as that.Earl gave a glowing endorsement of his first Lions tour – he appeared as a replacement in the first and third Tests – passionately expressing the hope he features on the next one and explaining why he returns to Saracens and England a much-improved player. The key, according to the 27-year-old back-rower, is essentially to go with the flow.Lions had special moments but lacked consistency needed to be ranked among greats | Robert KitsonRead moreHe cites as an example that on the way to the stadium last Saturday the door on the team bus became jammed and as a result the Lions had to decamp to another. In other, more highly strung environments, disruption like that can have a derailing effect, but Earl’s eyes have been opened to a world where not everything has to be perfect or prescriptive. To that end, it was instructive to hear he has spoken to England colleagues about bringing a similar attitude when they reconvene in October.“Just get out of your own way,” he says. “You can overthink this sport so much but when you’ve got a game on Saturday, then you’ve got to play again on Tuesday or Wednesday, you’re not going to be able to do every rep, review everything opposition. Get out of your own way and just play rugby.“It’s almost like you get to the pinnacle of our sport – this is what it is – and you’re back playing under-12s on a Sunday morning. There’s no preparation, you just go out, you have a plan, you try to implement it, you express yourself in a way Andy and the rest of the coaching staff have allowed us to do and I’ve loved every minute of it.“It’s been a life-changing experience, the highlight of my life, certainly my rugby-playing life. I’ve made friends for life, memories for life. It showed me something completely different in terms of the rugby side of things. I’ve loved it. It has been completely transformative for me and I’m a far better player because of it.View image in fullscreenJac Morgan and Ben Earl celebrate the Lions’ series victory.Photograph: David Davies/PA“I’ve spoken to fellow Englishmen that there’s some cool stuff we can bring back to camp and that’s sort of the whole point, isn’t it? We can come back and say, ‘there are some bits we’ve done here that work when we have time away or during campaigns’.“I’m almost excited to get going again. I need my time off, but I’m almost excited to get back into certain environments to be like, ‘have you thought about this?’.”Earl is equally effusive about Farrell’s coaching style. The Ireland head coach led the Lions to a first series win in 12 years on his first tour in the top job. “He has made me fully believe in how good I am,” says Earl. “Every time he talks to the group, I’m like, I’ll do anything for that man, I’m ready to play. Even when I’m not playing. Every time he spoke to the group, I’m like, when the time comes, I’m ready to play for this bloke.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are too many moving parts for me to comment on that. The more times I can take the field with that bloke, the better, let me put it that way.”Meanwhile, Dan Sheehan has been suspended for four matches following his illegal clearout of Australia’s Tom Lynagh during Saturday’s third Test. The sanction will be reduced to three games, subject to the Ireland and Leinster player successfully completing a coaching intervention course.Sheehan’s challenge in the first half of the Lions’ 22-12 loss went unpunished by Georgian referee Nika Amashukeli before he was retrospectively cited.

But who will it benefit? And why does he wish the tech giants had moved more slowly?Mon 4 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.37 EDTShareIf you have a mental image of a Nobel prizewinner, Demis Hassabis probably doesn’t fit it. Relatively young (he’s 49), mixed race (his father is Greek-Cypriot, his mother Chinese-Singaporean), state-educated, he didn’t exactly look out of place receiving his medal from the king of Sweden in December, amid a sea of grey-haired men, but it was “very surreal”, he admits. “I’m really bad at enjoying the moment. I’ve won prizes in the past, and I’m always thinking , ‘What’s the next thing?’ But this one was really special. It’s something you dream about as a kid.”Well, maybe notyou, but certainly him. Hassabis was marked out as exceptional from a young age – he was a chess prodigy when he was four. Today, arguably, he’s one of the most important people in the world. As head of GoogleDeepMind, the tech giant’s artificial intelligence arm, he’s driving, if not necessarily steering, what promises to be the most significant technological revolution of our lifetimes.As such, Hassabis finds himself in the position of being both a booster for AI and an apologist for it. The Nobel prize in chemistry was proof of the benefits AI can bring: DeepMind’s AlphaFold database was able to predict the hitherto-unfathomable structures of proteins, the building blocks of life – a breakthrough that could lead to myriad medical advances. At the same time, fears are ever growing about the AI future thatGoogleis helping to usher in.Being an AI ambassador is the part Hassabis didn’t dream about. “If I’d had my way, we would have left it in the lab for longer and done more things like AlphaFold, maybe cured cancer or something like that,” he says. “But it is what it is, and there’s some benefits to that. It’s great that everyone gets to play around with the latest AI and feel for themselves what it’s like. That’s useful for society, actually, to kind of normalise it and adapt to it, and for governments to be discussing it … I guess I have to speak up on, especially, the scientific side of how we should approach this, and think about the unknowns and how we can make them less unknown.”In person Hassabis is a mix of down-to-earth approachability and polished professionalism. Trim and well groomed, dressed entirely in black, he wears two watches: one a smart watch, the other an analogue dress watch (smart but not too flashy). He gives the impression of someone in a hurry. We’re speaking in his office at DeepMind’s London headquarters. On the walls outside are signed chess boards from greats such as Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Judit Polgár. He still plays; there’s a board set up on a table nearby.View image in fullscreenHassabis being awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry by the king of Sweden last year.Photograph: Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was the chess that started Hassabis down the path of thinking about thinking. Between the ages of four and 13 he played competitively in England junior teams. “When you do that at such a young age, it’s very formative for the way your brain works. A lot of the way I think is influenced by strategic thinking from chess, and dealing with pressure.”On paper there’s little else about Hassabis’s background that foretold his future. His family are more on the arty side: “My dad’s just finished composing a musical play in his retirement, which he staged at an arthouse theatre in north London. My sister’s a composer, so I’m kind of the outlier of the family.” They weren’t poor, but not super-wealthy. He moved between various state schools in north London, and was homeschooled for a few years.He was also a bit of an outsider at school, he says, but he seems to have known exactly where he was going. His childhood heroes were scientific pioneers such asAlan TuringandRichard Feynman. He spent his chess winnings on early home computers such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and a Commodore Amiga, and learned to code. “There were few people that were interested in computers in the late 80s. There was a group of us that used to hack around, making games and other stuff, and then that became my next career after chess.”In the 90s, the games industry was already working with AI. When he was 17, he coded the hit game Theme Park, in which players had to build a virtual amusement park. “The game reacted to how you were playing it,” he says. Put a food stall too close to the rollercoaster exit and your virtual punters would start throwing up.I said to Elon Musk, ‘What if AI was the thing that went wrong? Then being on Mars wouldn’t help you’After studying computer science at the University of Cambridge, then a PhD at University College London in neuroscience, he set up DeepMind in 2010 with Shane Legg, a fellow postdoctoral neuroscientist, and Mustafa Suleyman, a former schoolmate and a friend of his younger brother. The mission was straightforward, Hassabis says: “Solve intelligence and then use it to solve everything else.”DeepMind soon caught Silicon Valley’s attention. In 2014 the team showed off an AI that learned to master Atari video games such as Breakout, without any prior knowledge. Interest started to come from now-familiar tech players, including Peter Thiel (who was an early DeepMind investor), Google, Facebook and Elon Musk. Hassabis first met Musk in 2012. Over lunch at Space X’s factory in California, Musk told Hassabis his priority was getting to Mars “as a backup planet, in case something went wrong here. I don’t think he’d thought much about AI at that point.” Hassabis pointed out the flaw in his plan. “I said, ‘What if AI was the thing that went wrong? Then being on Mars wouldn’t help you, because if we got there, it would obviously be easy for an AI to get there, through our communication systems or whatever it was.’ He just hadn’t thought about that. So he sat there for a minute without saying anything, just sort of thinking, ‘Hmm, that’s probably true.’”Shortly after, Musk, too, became an investor in DeepMind.In 2014, Google bought the company for £400m (as a result, Musk and Thiel switched to backing the rival startup OpenAI). It wasn’t just access to cash and hardware that convinced them to go with Google. Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were computer scientists like him, and “saw Google as ultimately an AI company”, says Hassabis. He also used products such as Gmail and Maps. “And finally, I just thought that the mission of Google, which is to organise the world’s information, is a cool mission.”View image in fullscreenHassabis speaking before the Google DeepMind Challenge match in Seoul in 2016, in which it triumphed over South Korean Go grandmaster Lee Sedol.Photograph: Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty ImagesFrom his office window, we can see the vast beige bulk of Google’s just-about-finished new office, where DeepMind will be moving next year. It’s fair to say the reason the tech giant is putting so much into Britain is because of Hassabis, who insisted on staying in London. “Our first backers were like, ‘You’ve got to move to San Francisco,’ but I wanted to prove it was possible here,” he says. “I knew there was untapped talent around. And I knew, if we were successful, how important [AI] would be for the world, so I felt it was important to have a global approach to it, and, not just, you know, 100 square miles of Silicon Valley. I still believe that’s important.”In 2016, DeepMind again caught the tech world’s attention when its AI defeated one of the world’s best players of Go – a board game considerably more complex than chess. The AlphaFold breakthrough on protein structures was another leap forward: DeepMind has now solved the structures of over 200m proteins and made the resourcepublicly available.But the AI landscape shifted seismically in 2022 with the release of OpenAI’sChatGPT, which captured the public imagination with its uncanny ability to tackle a host of problems – from strategy planning to writing poetry. ChatGPT caught big tech off guard, especially Google. “They really went for scaling, almost in a bet-the-house sort of way, which is impressive, and maybe you have to do that as a startup,” says Hassabis. “We all had systems that are very similar, the leading labs, but we could see the flaws in it, like it would hallucinate sometimes. I don’t think anyone fully understood, including OpenAI, that there would be these amazing use cases for it, and people would get a lot of value out of them. So that’s an interesting lesson for us about how you can be a bit too close to your own technology.”We’ll have something that will exhibit all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10 yearsThe race is now on. DeepMind has become “the engine room of Google”, as Hassabis puts it, and AI is being built into every corner of its business: AI search summaries; smart assistant Gemini (Google’s answer to ChatGPT); an AI image generator (that can add in sound effects); AI-powered smart glasses, translation tools, shopping assistants. How much the public really craves this AI-enhanced world remains to be seen. Competitors are also raising their game. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and others are investing heavily, and poaching talent from their rivals. Zuckerberg is offering $100m salaries for top researchers. Suleyman, who left DeepMind in 2019, isnow head of Microsoft AI, which recentlypoached more than 20 engineersfrom DeepMind. He hesitates to call his former friend a rival: “We do very different things. I think he’s more on the commercial applied side; we’re still focused more on that frontier research side.”View image in fullscreen‘I believe in human ingenuity’ … Hassabis.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianThat frontier to be reached is surely AGI – “artificial general intelligence” – the pivotal point at which AI matches human intelligence. “I don’t know if it will be a single moment. It may be a gradual thing that happens,” he says, “but we’ll have something that we could sort of reasonably call AGI, that exhibits all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10 years, possibly the lower end of that.”In other words, we are in the final few years of pre-AGI civilisation, after which nothing may ever be the same again. To some the prospect is apocalyptic, to others, like Hassabis, it’s utopian.“Assuming we steward it safely and responsibly into the world, and obviously we’re trying to play our part in that, then we should be in a world of what I sometimes call radical abundance,” says Hassabis. He paints a picture of medical advances, room-temperature superconductors, nuclear fusion, advances in materials, mathematics. “It should lead to incredible productivity and therefore prosperity for society. Of course, we’ve got to make sure it gets distributed fairly, but that’s more of a political question. And if it is, we should be in an amazing world of abundance for maybe the first time in human history, where things don’t have to be zero sum. And if that works, we should be travelling to the stars, really.”Is he getting too close to his own technology? There are so many issues around AI, it’s difficult to know where to even begin: deepfakes and misinformation; replacement of human jobs; vast energy consumption; use of copyright material, or simply AI deciding that we humans are expendable and taking matters into its own hands.To pick one issue, the amount of water and electricity that future AI datacentres are predicted to require is astronomical, especially when the world is facing drought and a climate crisis. By the time AI cracks nuclear fusion, we may not have a planet left. “There’s lots of ways of fixing that,” Hassabis replies. “Yes, the energy required is going to be a lot for AI systems, but the amount we’re going to get back, even just narrowly for climate [solutions] from these models, it’s going to far outweigh the energy costs.”There’s also the worry that “radical abundance” is another way of framing “mass unemployment”: AI is already replacing human jobs. When we “never need to work again” – as many have promised – doesn’t that really mean we’re surrendering our economic power to whoever controls the AI? “That’s going to be one of the biggest things we’re gonna have to figure out,” he acknowledges. “Let’s say we get radical abundance, and we distribute that in a good way, what happens next?”Hassabis has two sons in their late teens(his Italian-born wife is a molecular biologist). What does he envisage for their future? “It’s a bit like the era I was growing up in, where home computers were coming online. Obviously it’s going to be bigger than that, but you’ve got to embrace the new technology ... If you become an expert, kind of a ninja, at using these things, it’s going to really empower the people that are good at these tools.”Non-ninjas will still have a place, however: “We need some great philosophers, but also economists to think about what the world should look like when something like this comes along. What is purpose? What is meaning?” He points out that there are many things we do that aren’t strictly for utility: sports, meditation, arts. “We’re going to lean into those areas, as a society, even more heavily, because we’ll have the time and the resources to do so.”View image in fullscreenHassabis, age 23, in 1999, when he was head of Elixir Studios.Photograph: David Sillitoe/The GuardianIt’s difficult to see Hassabis himself carving out much of that time, between DeepMind, his drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs and his endless public appearances – the list goes on. “I don’t have much time that isn’t working, seven days a week,” he acknowledges. “I spend time with my kids playing games, board games, and that’s some of my most fun times.” He doesn’t let them win, he says. “We play very competitively.”He’s also a season ticket holder at Liverpool FC and makes it to “six, seven games a year”. He still plays chess online – “It’s a bit like going to the gym, for the mind.” And he’s a mean poker player, apparently. The night after winning his Nobel prize he celebrated with a poker night with Magnus Carlsen and some world poker champions. “In another universe, I might have been a professional gamer.”So, no fears about the future? “I’m a cautious optimist,” he says. “So overall, if we’re given the time, I believe in human ingenuity. I think we’ll get this right. I think also, humans are infinitely adaptable. I mean, look where we are today. Our brains were evolved for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and we’re in modern civilisation. The difference here is, it’s going to be 10 times bigger than the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.” The Industrial Revolution was not plain sailing for everyone, he admits, “but we wouldn’t wish it hadn’t happened. Obviously, we should try to minimise that disruption, but there is going to be change – hopefully for the better.”This article was amended on 4 August 2025 because an earlier version said OpenAI’s “ChatGPT3” was released in 2020; that meant to refer to ChatGPT, which was released in 2022. The organisation’s GPT-3 was released in 2020, but not to the general public.Explore more on these topicsDeepMindThe G2 interviewArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleElon MuskNobel prizesSilicon ValleyChatGPTinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Far from being an early adopter, we have allowed ourselves to be left behind,” wrote Osborne in aFinancial Times opinion piece.Liverpool is crypto capital of UK, survey findsRead moreOsborne said the UK was now about to miss a new surge in the crypto market: stablecoins.Unlike bitcoin, which is prone to extreme fluctuations in price, stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to the value of real-world currencies such as the dollar – and thus designed to maintain a stable value. However, a leading stablecoin, TerraUSD,collapsed in 2022.“If Britain was the only financial centre in the world we could take our time to evaluate how stablecoins will develop, but we are not,” wrote Osborne. “Singapore, Hong Kong and Abu Dhabi have adopted comprehensive legislative frameworks for crypto asset platforms.”Osborne also pointed to the passing of the US Genius Act, which creates a regulatory regime for stablecoins – the majority of which are now dollar-backed.“The crypto revolution may have started with plans to replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, but it is reinforcing its dominance. Britain’s current approach ensures the pound won’t even play a supporting role,” Osborne wrote.US citizens can buy a bitcoin exchange traded fund – a basket of assets that can be bought and sold like shares on an exchange – whereas in the UK retail investors cannot do so.Osborne accused the UK of prevaricating over stablecoins, with the current chancellor, Rachel Reeves, showing insufficient commitment with a promise last month to “drive forward” on stablecoins, while theBank of Englandremained sceptical.In a speech last month, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, called for the development of standards that show whether stablecoins pass the test of “singleness of money” – or whether a stablecoin can beexchanged with another form of moneyone-for-one.“This hesitation risks irrelevance,” wrote Osborne, who added that it was time for the UK to “catch up”.Other crypto advocates from the era of the 2010-15 Conservative-led coalition government include another former chancellor, Philip Hammond, who is chair of the crypto firm Copper.A Treasury spokesperson said the government’s economic strategy was combining support for innovation with safety for consumers.“Robust rules around crypto will boost investor confidence, support the growth of fintech and protect people across the UK,” the spokesperson said.Explore more on these topicsCryptocurrenciesGeorge OsborneCurrenciesBank of EnglandE-commercenewsShareReuse this content"

Amid mounting concerns about the ease of accessing harmful content online, rules were drawn up to force social platforms to protect children from posts and videos that incite hatred or encourage suicide, self-harm or eating disorders.But within days of coming into force, the new approach to keeping children safe online had become a rallying point for the right in both Britain and the US.Last weekNigel Farage, leader of the populist Reform UK party, was embroiled in a furious row with a Labour government minister after pledging to repeal the legislation.Meanwhile Republicans held meetings with UK politicians and the communications regulator, Ofcom. The impact of the new law is also being keenly watched in Australia, which ispreparing to ban under-16s from social media.Experts say the inherent tensions in the act – between taking down harmful content swiftly and preserving free speech – are likely to bubble away.Zia Yusuf, a senior Reform figure, said: “So much of the act is massive overreach and plunges this country into a borderline dystopian state.”In response to Reform UK’s criticism of the law,Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, said: “Make no mistake about it, if people like Jimmy Savile were alive today, he’d be perpetrating his crimes online. And Nigel Farage is saying that he’s on their side.”Kyle was referring to provisions in the act that seek to prevent children being groomed via messaging apps. Farage said the technology secretary’s words were “disgusting” and demanded an apology, which was not forthcoming.“To say that I would do anything that would in any way aid and abet people like Jimmy Savile, it’s so below the belt,” Farage added.What are the new UK online safety rules and how will age checks on adult content be enforced?Read moreIt is not only the British right that is protesting against the act. JD Vance, the US vice-president, said free speech in the UK is “in retreat”. Last week, Jim Jordan, a Republican congressman who has criticised the act, led a delegation of US politicians to discuss the legislation with Kyle andOfcom.Jordan called the act the “UK’s online censorship law” and accused Ofcom, which is implementing the legislation, of “targeting” and “harassing” US companies. The group of Republican and Democrat politicians also visited Brussels to discuss the Online Safety Act’s EU equivalent,the Digital Services Act.Another Republican politician in the delegation, Scott Fitzgerald, said he thought the White House would certainly be “interested in finding out” what the group discovered.The Trump administration’s concerns have extended to threatening Ofcom and EU staff with a visa ban. In May the state department announced it willblock entry to the USto “foreign nationals who censor Americans”. Ofcom has said it is seeking “clarity” on the planned visa restrictions.Concerns over free speech also intersect with economic interest. The major tech platforms that come under the aegis of the act – Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat and X – are all based in the US. Companies can be fined up to £18m or 10% of global turnover for breaches, or whichever is greater. In the case of Meta, the parent of Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, such a fine would equate to $16bn (£11bn).On Friday, the social media platform X, owned by self-professed free speech advocate Elon Musk,issued a statementcondemning enforcement of the act, saying the legislation was at risk of “seriously infringing” free speech.There are also signs of a popular backlash in the UK. A petition calling for the repeal of the act has accumulated more than 480,000 signatures – which means it will be considered for a debate in parliament – and has been posted on social media by the far-right activist Tommy Robinson.Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, doubts nonetheless whether freedom of speech is a vote-winner.“Petition or no petition, it’s not a big issue for most people. Clearly for the extremely online – whether on the right or left – it’s an issue, but it’s not going to sway a large number of votes with the majority of the population.”Three in four UK parents are concerned about what their children are seeing, hearing or doing online, according to a recent Ipsos Mori poll.Beeban Kidron, a UK peer and leading campaigner on online child safety, told the Guardian she was “happy to take Nigel Farage and his colleagues through the act”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they also require platforms to prevent children from accessing content that encourages suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, as well as suppressing the spread of material that is abusive or incites hatred, or promotes harmful substances and dangerous challenges.Some content has been age-gated to avoid being classified as breaching those regulations. In the Daily Telegraph, Farage claimed that footage of ananti-migrant protesthad been “censored”, as well as an attempt at “exposing the truth” about theRotherham grooming gangsscandal.These examples were on X and included a speech by a Conservative MP, Katie Lam, on theUK’s child grooming scandal. The content was covered by a notice stating that “due to local laws, we are temporarily restricting access to this content until X estimates your age”. The Guardian found no way to access an age-verification service on X, indicating that for now the platform’s policy is to default many users to a child-appropriate service until age checks are fully up and running.Everything the right - and the left – are getting wrong about the Online Safety Act  | George BillingeRead moreX has been approached for comment on the age-checks.On Reddit, forums about alcohol abuse,pet careand the Al Jazeera broadcast network also ask for age checks before accessing them. A Reddit spokesperson confirmed theage-checking was because of the Online Safety Actand its restrictions on content that is illegal or harmful to under-18s.Big Brother Watch, a civil liberties and privacy campaign group, said theRedditand X examples showed the new law was already over-regulating.An Ofcom spokesperson said the act required tech companies to prevent children from seeing content harmful to them as well as tackling criminal content, while protecting free speech. “There is no requirement on them to restrict legal content for adult users.”Mark Jones, a partner at the London law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said there was a risk that in exercising their duty to remove illegal content or material that was harmful to children, social media companies may be overly cautious and remove perfectly legal material in the UK.He added that rows over how content was treated by Ofcom were likely to run and run because of the tension between speedily tackling harmful content and letting free speech reign.“Quick decisions are needed in order to prevent the spread of harmful or illegal content. And with that need for speed comes a risk that a decision made under time pressure may be incorrect. But that is the reality of the situation. Mistakes will be made – albeit from a position of trying to prevent harm,” he said.Last week’s row over the Online Safety Act will not be the last.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyChild protectionSocial mediaNigel FarageReform UKPeter KyleOfcomfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But until they are, adults can model the positive use of techDr Kaitlyn Regehr is the programme director of digital humanities at University College LondonMon 4 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.46 EDTShareThis summer the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, announcedhe was consideringa two-hour “screen time” cap on children’s use of social media apps – a proposal that is not just insufficient, it’s outdated.Though appropriately placed at the start of the summer holiday – a time when kids’ screen time can increase, along with the onus on parents to ensure the safety of such engagement – Kyle’s announcement is linked to somewhat stale screen time guidance. We should indeed be thinking about moderating time on screens, but the proposed cap addresses only the quantity of consumption, not the quality. Fortunately, as someone who lectures on digital literacy (and is a mother), I can tell you there are some ways to push back and create healthier habits for children this summer – even if the government doesn’t seem to have caught up with them yet.Limiting screen time has been the dominant digital guidance used by parents, educators – and all of us really – over the past decade. This advice emerged afterstudies indicatedthat increasing screen time could be a risk factor for being overweight/obesity in children and adolescents. This was, and is, good guidance to promote physical health. However, it didn’t include robust discussion about how the quality or nature of content online might be affecting mental health.For example, in following this guidance, you could have one child watching CBeebies with their family in a communal space, engaging in discussion; and another child wearing headphones and watching algorithmically driven YouTube shorts. Under “screen time” guidance, these two forms of viewing would be considered equal. But, of course, they are qualitatively very different. In this scenario, one child is engaged in interactive, collective viewing with a parent that might be a jumping-off point for discussion and connection. The other child’s viewing is isolated and fragmented; they are consuming short-form content, probably with little focus on meaningful storylines or characters, on a platform that is still, by comparison, unregulated.YouTubeis where much of our kids’ screen time is spent, and is nowthe most popular first TV destinationfor generation Alpha. A staggering88% of UK childrenaged three to 17 use the platform. And yet YouTube is often not included in discussions of social media bans, and nor was it mentioned in Kyle’s statement.There have been attempts to distinguish between types of screen time, such as “passive” and “active” engagement. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health haspushed for policyto focus on habits and behaviours. This might take into account “active screen time”, which involves cognitively or physically engaging in screen-based activities, such as playing games or completing homework on a computer, and “passive screen time”, which includes non-interactive viewing with low levels of intellectual and social engagement.Similarly, theAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatryrecommends familiarising yourself with what your child is watching and talking to them about it – and in ways that makes screen time more social, educational and creative. However, for the most part, these suggestions have not been fully embraced by the public or political zeitgeist.In encouraging more intentional choices about what and how kids are watching, I am not suggesting that heaping personal responsibility on to individuals is the answer. We are in the midst of a digital public health crisis. One that has prompted theUS surgeon general Vivek Murthy’sto suggest that social media increases the risk that children will experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. Bold policies that address the underlying technical and financial structures of these platforms are necessary. This is where Kyle should direct his attention.In the meantime, the proposals Kyle should be offering the public should not be limply drawn from outdated guidance. Proposals should be based on a deeper understanding around differing forms of usage. They should consider both physical and mental health concerns, and address systemic issues in the design of digital platforms. And crucially, they should take into account not just quantity, but also the quality of our children’s digital consumption.Until then, however, the onus of responsibility will fall primarily on individuals – in this case, on parents – to ensure their children are learning, engaged, active and safe. That sounds overwhelming. I know. If it helps, here are some of the things I’ll be doing with my kids during the summer holidays.For younger children, time off screens is generally better than on. However, when we do use screens, I encourage my own children to watch live TV on platforms such as CBeebies and CBBC, as this provides a diversity of content curated by a children’s programmer. Lots of time and advocacy has gone into producing it.Prioritise active and engaged viewing over passive viewing. This means content that encourages creativity and discussion. This supports active brain engagement, learning and communication skills. It’s often better to opt for collective over solitary viewing, which can act as a springboard for discussion and build critical thinking and social engagement skills.Begin seeding critical thinking about digital content from an early age. You can input questionable images into platforms such asSightengine, and they will tell you how likely each image is to be fake. This is a great way to start conversations about disinformation online.Speak to older children about what they want their digital diet to look like. Together, dedicate half an hour a week to training the machine learning by actively searching for positive content – content that they are passionate about or that makes them feel good. Don’t watch uninteresting, uninspiring content or content that makes them (or you) feel bad. Quickly move past it. And teach them not to like, share things or comment on things that they don’t like. Evencommenting on somethingyou don’t like counts as engagement, meaning you may get more of it.As a family, do an “uninspiring” clean. If it no longer inspires or educates you, unfollow it. This includes exes, TV personalities and brands. Do this regularly to clean up your feed and narrow in on what you do want to see.To combat targeted advertising, there are some Google alternatives you might want to look at as a family. DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus are search engines that do not track you to serve targeted ads. You could also look atStartpage, which allows you to use Google without tracking your digital footprint.Governments may not be properly regulating this technology, but as parents, there are still things we can do. We can be more intentional about our screen use – and in doing so, begin to seed the ideas of healthy, critical screen engagement from an early age.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is the programme director of digital humanities at University College London, lecturing on digital literacy and the ethical implications of social media and AI.

A runaway train is hurtling towards five people tied to the tracks. You can pull a lever to divert the train to a different track to which only one person is tied. Do you intervene to kill the one and spare the five?What if one of the tracks twisted into a really cool loop-the-loop? Or the trolley was replaced by a bloodthirsty Thomas the Tank Engine? Or the whole dilemma was clumsily altered to comment on the political controversy of the day? Originally formulated as a reflection on moral decision-making, the trolley problem found a second life in the 2010s as a well of inspiration for variously silly, irreverent and self-referential trolley-based memes. Now, it may be entering its third era as surreal interactive comedy game The Trolley Solution.Each level plays as a minigame tenuously shaped around the thought experiment. There’s always a trolley, a lever and a pseudo-ethical dilemma, plus a twist to throw everything off the rails. The track is dissected into puzzle pieces that you must reassemble against the clock. A commuter next to the rails needs help remaining emotionally stable by balancing the blasts of serotonin they receive from scrolling social media. One level spirals into a short visual novel about a Japanese girl falling in love with a tram that threatens to murder her high school rival.View image in fullscreenIdeally suited to the era of social media … The Trolley Solution.Photograph: byDanDansIt is, obviously, all very silly, and sees in the trolley problem the same absurdity as the memes. “It’s a serious matter presented in a kind of ridiculous way,” says solo Chilean developer byDanDans. Or, as he puts it in terms of a Reddit thread: “It’s free real estate for shit-posting.”With the basic gag already well worn, byDanDans focused on iterating the dilemma into quirkier scenarios and experimenting broadly with the minigames, before nailing down the final selection. “Some iterations were too bland, too unfunny,” he says. “Or I just couldn’t think of a minigame that followed the four rules I set for myself.” Those rules being that each minigame needed to be fun, connected to the dilemma that unlocks it, do something that hasn’t been seen before, and subvert expectations.Even so, if all this sounds a bit gimmicky that’s largely because it is. The trolley solution may be best thought of as an extended interactive sketch show based around a single joke. But it’s a joke with enough charm and a quick enough punchline (each minigame lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, and the level select screen hints at a concise total run time) that it shouldn’t become stale.In many ways, it’s also ideally suited to the era of social media. The humour is internet-coded and the bite-size minigames are a perfect fit for quickfire TikToks pitched to video game laymen. “I did try to make something easy to pick up and finish,” says byDanDans. “My previous games were too technical and too hardcore for most players. I tried to make something anyone could enjoy.”Enjoy is a slightly weird word to use in the context of an ethical dilemma. If byDanDans were faced with the original trolley problem, what would he do? “I’d have to go with the option that leads to fewer legal repercussions,” he says. “I’d call the cops, scream for help, and try to untie or push them off the tracks.” So he’d ignore the parameters of the thought experiment and concoct a far-fetched scheme for added excitement?

But within 48 hours, the data told a very different story, giving theDemocratsa badly needed openingifthey can muster the competence and focus to seize upon it.On Thursday, the US commerce departmentannouncedthat inflation had ticked up to 2.6%. A day later, the labor department reported that unemployment had risen to 4.2% in July, and that the US had actually gained258,000fewerjobsthan previously reported.From the looks of things,Donald Trumpand histariffsare damaging the economy. Suddenly, things aren’t looking so hot.Rather than copping to a screw-up, however, the president immediately laid blame elsewhere. In a barrage of posts on social media, helambastedJerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, attacked his intelligence and again threatened his tenure at the Fed.Despite Trump, the US economy remains surprisingly resilient. But for how long? | Richard PartingtonRead moreThe president trashed Powell, who he appointed, as “a stubborn MORON”. Adding insult to injury, Trump brayed: “IF HE CONTINUES TO REFUSE, THE BOARD SHOULD ASSUME CONTROL, AND DO WHAT EVERYONE KNOWS HAS TO BE DONE!”But things didn’t end there. The tantrum continued unabated.Hours later, Trump grabbed another page from the strongman playbook andfiredErika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He suggested that she hadcooked the booksand was essentially giving aid and comfort to Joe Biden, the man who first appointed her.As we know, there is reality and then there is Trump’s version of reality.At Friday’s final bell, the Dow had dropped more than 540 points and the Nasdaq was down 2.24%. The ghost of Trump’s so-called “liberation day” had returned to haunt the markets, giving theDemocratsample material to work with.Already, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act places Trump and the Republicans at odds with their base and with swing voters. According to aWall Street Journal poll, 70% of the US believes the actbenefits the rich. Beyond that, the tax plan is underwater with the public, 42-52, and is disfavored by a majority of independents.Practically speaking, the Congressional Budget Officeprojectedin June that nearly 8 million people wouldlose their insuranceunder the Trump-backed bill. For the current iteration of the GOP, that’s a problem. These days, Republican voters tilt working class. Many of them break economically liberal and socially conservative.This why HouseRepublicansdanced around the issue of coming Medicaid cuts. They stand to harm their own voters. And they know it.Take Mike Lawler, a representative from New York’s Hudson Valley. More than 200,000 of his constituents receive Medicaid benefits. Town halls in his district have become rowdy events, with thepolice hauling out a constituent.Lawler claims to have “fought extensively to make sure that there were not draconian changes to Medicaid”.“At the end of the day, this is about strengthening the program,”Lawler added. Uh, that’s why he needed the cops.More than 64 Republican House members represent districts where Medicaid rates exceed the national average,according to CNN. In those seats, five incumbents won last November by five points or fewer.But the GOP’s problems don’t end with Medicaid. These days, social security, the most sacrosanct legacy of the New Deal, may be in the crosshairs of Team Trump.On Wednesday, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary,acknowledgedthe so-called “Trump accounts” created for kids by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act were actually a “back door for privatizing social security”.The simple way Democrats should talk about Trump and Epstein | Peter RothpletzRead moreThe accounts are designed as a vehicle for Americans to build and accumulate wealth as soon as they are born. Under the new law, newborns will be eligible to receive $1,000 from Uncle Sam.“Social security is a defined benefit plan paid out,” Bessent explained. “To the extent that if all of a sudden these accounts grow, and you have in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for your retirement, then that’s a gamechanger.”As a candidate and then again in office, Trump had pledged to leave social security untouched. Nowthat pledge is in doubt.In 2024, the Republicans made the economic failures of the Biden-Harris administration central to their campaigns. The Trump-Vance campaign raked the Democrats over the coals over inflation. In politics, turnabout is fair play. It is time for the Democrats to show that they actually care about the average voter.Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York and served in the US Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992Explore more on these topicsUS economyOpinionDemocratsDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS politicsRepublicansUS CongresscommentShareReuse this content"

Over the next five days, the drug-running paramilitaries slaughtered 17 people, raped multiple women and burned the town down, forcing the remaining townspeople to flee.The attorney Jesús María Valle had been pleading with the state governor, Álvaro Uribe, for over a year to stop the paramilitaries’ brutal takeover of the countryside and collusion with the military. Instead, Uribe labeled Valle an “enemy of the armed forces”. In a statement to prosecutors after the El Aro massacre, Valle asked for a full investigation into what he described as an “alliance” in Antioquia among paramilitaries, the military and Uribe to kill civilians and seize their land, in the name of fighting the country’s leftwing Farc guerrillas. Within days, two men in suits strode into Valle’s law office in downtown Medellín and shot him dead.Want to beat authoritarianism? Look to Latin America | Greg GrandinRead moreOn 1 August, Uribe, who went on to become Colombia’s president in 2002, was sentenced to 12 years of house arrest after a Colombian court convicted him of bribing a witness who had linked him to the paramilitaries. The conviction could still be overturned on appeal, but the fact that it has happened at all is a striking development that would have seemed almost inconceivable a decade or so ago. In a time of rising autocracy and abuse, including in the US, it also offers reasons for hope.For decades, Uribe seemed almost untouchable. As president, he gained domestic and international acclaim – including the US Presidential Medal of Freedom from George W Bush – because of his successes, with billions of dollars in US military aid, in beating back the abusive Farc. When I met him in 2004, he strode about his conference room, lecturing me and my then colleagues on how nobody had done more than he had to bring safety to the country.Glowing portrayals of Uribe’s record at the time routinely glossed over his efforts to pass laws favoring the paramilitaries and to undermine investigations of their links to those in power. During his presidency, the Colombian supreme court conducted what became known as the “parapolitics” investigations into about one-third of members of Congress for collusion – including in many cases electoral fraud – with the paramilitaries. Uribe engaged in a furioussmear campaignagainst the justices and his intelligence service engaged inillegal surveillanceof the justices and independent journalists.Yet over the years, senior paramilitary leaders have testified to the involvement of the army and Uribe’s chief of staff in Antioquia,Pedro Juan Moreno, in the El Aro massacre. Multiple investigations have documented widespread collusion between paramilitaries and important sectors of the military and political establishment at the time. There is also evidence – including statements that I obtained in a prison interview with a paramilitary leader – that Uribe’s office, when he was governor, had close ties to paramilitaries, and that Moreno approved Valle’s murder. Uribe has repeatedly denied it all.The conviction this week emerged in the context of a supreme court investigation into allegations that Uribe started a paramilitary group in the 1990s. Uribe claimed early on that the allegations were manufactured by a member of congress, but the court found there was no basis to his claims. Instead, the supreme court ordered a new investigation into possible witness tampering by people working for Uribe (then a senator), including alleged payments to paramilitaries to change their testimony. Uribe quit his senate seat, forcing the case to be moved from the supreme court to a lower court, and – with prosecutors seemingly unwilling to move it forward – it looked for years like the case might just die out like many other previous investigations. However, with a new chief prosecutor in place, the case picked up steam again, finally resulting in this week’s conviction.Not surprisingly, Donald Trump’s US administration has been trying to discredit Colombia’s courts, with Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, decrying the “weaponization of Colombia’s judicial branch”. But this is all now part of a tired playbook.It’s the same rhetoric Trump and his allies have been using to discredit US courts – even Trump appointees – that have ruled against them. It’s how Trump has talked about the case against his buddy Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, and about the investigations conducted by the international criminal court. And it’s how Uribe himself smeared activists like Jesús María Valle in the 1990s and sought to undermine the Colombian supreme court in the early 2000s.But, to me, this week’s ruling stands for something else: that no matter how much power leaders may amass, they are not ultimately above the law. And no matter how desperate the situation, with courage and commitment, there is much we can do to create a path toward accountability.Maria McFarland Sánchez-Moreno is CEO ofRepresentUsand the author of the award-winning book There Are No Dead Here: A Story of Murder and Denial in Colombia.

In fact, the outer path might just be the way to reach your inner peaceMon 4 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.22 EDTShareThe ancient Aztecs aren’t usually grouped with today’s self-help gurus. But their philosophy, preserved in early post-conquest records, offers surprisingly sharp tools for modern life. Unlike stoicism or Buddhism, which emphasize internal reflection as the path to a better life, the Aztecs believed that you should start with your surroundings, your relationships, your body and speech. In their view, wisdom begins outside. Here are 10 lessons from their “outward path”, starting with those that clarify life goals.1 You aren’t really after happiness, you just think you areThe pursuit of happiness is written into the US Declaration of Independence. Aristotle wrote volumes about its role as the chief aim of our life more than 2,000 years before that. While it’s a staple notion in our culture, the Aztecs took a more realistic approach. “Happiness”, when it’s not some complicated idea that’s drifted from our ordinary meaning, is fleeting and tends to be followed by its opposite: pain or at least fatigue.That means “happiness” isn’t a suitable goal in life, though it at first looks plausible. What you truly want is something richer, and they likened it to rootedness: being firmly grounded in your body, mind, society and nature. We make sacrifices for our friends and our children, after all, and we think our lives are better for it. That’s exactly the Aztec point.2 The things that make life worth living also make it fragileA second idea, which finds some expression in stoicism and Buddhism, is that you’re after a life that is invulnerable. It’s the notion that if you’re a good person, none of the things that matter in your life can be affected by life’s unpredictable events, even by tragedies.The Aztecs wouldn’t agree. The best things in life, such as love, integrity and justice, also expose you to pain. Emiliano Zapata, the people’s revolutionary inMexicowho was fluent in Nahuatl and loyal to his people, died young because he refused to betray his values. Aztec ethics embrace this tension: that meaning arises from choices that involve risk. A well-rooted life accepts heartbreak as part of the price of significance.3 The wise don’t think for themselvesIt’s tempting to think that if you were just smart enough, you’d have all the answers. We tend to valorize the “lone wolf” individual who knows better than the crowd. But for the Aztecs, you shouldn’t need to “go it alone” if you live in a healthy community of friends and family. Ideally, good thinking is done in good groups.The Aztecs held structured group deliberations, where even the young had a voice, though experience carried weight. They would advise that you could build your own “decision circle” and vet your goals with people who challenge and support you. If you’re thinking alone, you’re probably not thinking at your best.4 Great courage comes from small thingsThe stories of Aztec heroism during the colonial period are legion. For example, it turns out that Cortés had a son, named Martín, with a Native woman. And though Martín should have been treated well, he was left bereft of political protection some time after his (in)famous father died. Local authorities captured him and forced him to endure brutal torture in an attempt to provoke a false confession. Martín never gave in.While such feats of endurance are partly grounded in a person’s innate personality, Martín may well have learned some of the ways the Aztecs instilled courage through repeated small hardships. They didn’t optimize for ease. They taught their children to sweep before dawn, to carry heavy logs, and to stay up late. But in these many small feats, they also taught them how to sing while they worked and to manage their outlook. Courage starts small and grows strong.5 Social vulnerability builds lifelong stabilityWe live in a world under the constant gaze of others. Yet, if you want to live your life, and not the life “they” tell you to lead, you will have to learn to ignore “them”. Similarly, if you want to live well, to preserve the value of your own self-worth, then you need to learn what is of real value. One father is documented as he proudly recounts doing humble, hard work to raise his son, never stealing even a grain.You can build this skill through strategic vulnerability. Try doing something mildly embarrassing. Speak the truth when it’s awkward. Let your social mask slip. That’s how you can try to gain some distance from “their” gaze.6 Willpower isn’t one thing, it’s threeA paradox I noticed in graduate school was that I had no problem putting in hours of tedious study, but I would cave on my dieting goals if someone put a cookie in front of me. The Aztecs took an approach that solves this paradox. Willpower comes in three forms:Drive (high-intensity action),Durability (consistent effort), andDiscipline (resistance to temptation).You need different tools for different challenges. Running into a flooded basement is not the same as resisting late-night cake. You need to train all three.7 When on the path, it’s easier to stay on the pathConsistent action begets more consistent action. Aztec students swept daily before sunrise and kept their rooms clean. Today, it might be spending 15 minutes each day on a foreign language or making your bed. Whatever it is, hook your new effort to an existing habit to build yet more consistent actions.8 You need to practice cravings to stop themThe Aztecs fasted not to shame their bodies but to train them. Fasting was paired with feasting and used to practice discipline, the kind of willpower that opposes temptation. The goal was a higher-level awareness of your reactions. For example, you might notice that hunger comes in waves, rather than building infinitely. Craving, like emotion, can be ridden out if you know what to expect and why you endure.9 What crosses your lips pre-frames your mindThe Aztecs emphasized “right speech” as a way of aligning outer habits with inner values. Words, once spoken, nudge your mind into specific frames of thought. So they trained children to speak deliberately, truthfully, humbly, and to avoid gossip. Modern psychologists like Robert Cialdini have come to similar conclusions. What you say out loud subtly rewires how you think. So be careful: your words communicate thoughts and calibrate your expectations.10 Why the wise follow the outward pathThe Aztecs believed wisdom starts not with introspection but with habit, ritual and environment. Clean your space. Speak with care. Eat with intention. Build habits that train your body and attune your mind. As you do, your inner world comes into alignment.You don’t need to solve your soul before setting your house in order. In fact, the outer path might just be the way to reach your inner peace.Sebastian Purcell is an associate professor of philosophy at Suny-Cortland in New York, where he researches ethics, Aztec philosophy and mathematical logic.

There must be a reckoningMon 4 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 14.16 EDTShareNothing is more insufferable than someone saying “I told you so”; so please forgive me for being insufferable. On 29 September 2023, after a couple of months spent in the US, Ipublished a columnthat was well summarised in its Guardian headline: “Unless Joe Biden stands aside, the world must prepare for President Trump 2.0”. We can never definitely say “what would have happened if …?”, but there’s a very good chance that had Biden cleared the way for a Democratic primary in autumn 2023 the strongest candidate could have defeated Trump. The entire world would have been spared the disaster now unfolding.“No use crying over spilt milk,” you may say. Yes, but it’s always worth learning lessons for the future. I’m back in the US now, and arecent pollfor the Wall Street Journal found that 63% of voters hold an unfavourable view of the Democratic party. To put it mildly, the Democrats have a way to go.So what, given all that is happening and everything we now know, are the right lessons? The point of mentioning my old column is not to boast of some special insider insight into Washington high politics; the point is precisely that I had none. It was just obviously crazy to put up a visibly old and frail candidate who would be 86 years old by the end of his second term. For comparison, the leaders of the Soviet Union who we think of as the epitome of decrepit gerontocracy were, at their respective moments of unlamented demise, 75 (Leonid Brezhnev), 69 (Yuri Andropov) and 73 (Konstantin Chernenko).It required no special knowledge to see this and most Americans already did. By the time I wrote my column, an opinion poll had found that77% of Americansthought Biden was too old to be president for another four years. It was only the political insiders, the liberal commentariat, the Democratic establishment, who went on agreeing with the president, his family and what was (you couldn’t make this up) actually known informally as the “politburo” of his closest advisers that he was the only man for the job.In their recent, much noticed book,Original Sin, two leading Washington journalists, CNN’sJake TapperandAlex Thompsonof Axios, argue that there was, as their subtitle suggests, a cover up. Biden’s family and the politburo tried to hide his precipitate cognitive decline, confining most of his meetings to between 10am and 4pm. Even cabinet members did not see him up close for many months and in-depth media interviews were as rare as a Pride parade in the Vatican.The authors generously apportion blame to the president, his wife, other family members and his closest advisers, but there’s one set of people they curiously spare: themselves and their fellow Washington insider journalists. Now, I haven’t gone back over all their reporting on CNN and Axios, and there are certainlysome piecesthat should be cited to defend their journalistic record. But there is no doubt that American political journalists in general, and the liberal commentariat in particular, were slow and late to say what most “ordinary” Americans had long since seen.Why? The New York Times writer Ezra Klein digs into this inan episodeof his excellent podcast. Frankly acknowledging that his own February 2024 call for Biden to stand aside was “late”, Klein explores in conversation with Tapper why most others were even later. The answer seems to be a mix of ingredients: journalistic fear of losing access; the vindictive tribalism of the Democratic establishment; deference to an imperial presidency; fear of Donald Trump; worry about Kamala Harris as the presumptive alternative candidate.Fear of losing access is a professional disease of journalism. “You felt like you were destroying all of your relationships with the White House all at once,” says Klein, recalling his February 2024 demarche. “Yes, not just with the White House but the Democratic party,” adds Tapper. My own September 2023 notebook sums up a private conversation with a Washington-based columnist: “Yes, Biden should stand aside. He [the columnist] can’t say it.” (My note continues: “Jill Biden could, but she likes it.”)I know, also from other sources, just how threatening the Democratic establishment could be when trying to close down any questioning of Biden’s fitness to serve a second term. Even in the critical articles that did appear in US media there was a kind of residual deference to the presidency, almost as though they were asking a king to abdicate rather than just another politician to stand aside. Partly this stems from the 237-year-old US constitutional device of rolling your prime minister and monarch into one. In Britain, we confine our residual deference to the monarch while the prime minister gets roasted every Wednesday at prime minister’s questions in the House of Commons. Someone in Biden’s 2023 state of dotage wouldn’t have survived two weeks in Westminster.Then there’s the fact that people were already panicking about Trump and it was somehow thought, especially after Democratic successes in the 2022 midterm elections, that Biden was the only guy to beat him. The more so since the presumptive alternative was Harris, who was seen as a relatively weak candidate. And so, for fear of getting Harris and then Trump, they got Harris and then Trump.The simple way Democrats should talk about Trump and Epstein | Peter RothpletzRead moreSome lessons, then, are clear. Tapper and Thompson open their book with a quotation from George Orwell: “To see what is in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle.” But Orwell also calls on us always to say what we do see, even if – no, especially if – it’s uncomfortable for our own side. There’s the double test for journalists: see it and say it.For the Democratic establishment: don’t try to intimidate the media into self-censorship with the argument that they are giving succour to the enemy. You would have been better served by journalists just doing their job, in the spirit of Orwell. Then: change out your old guard. Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, is older than Chernenko and rapidly catching up on Brezhnev. Oh yes, and simply listen to the people you’re meant to represent.The tragedy of this whole story is that the Democrats have a profusion of talent in younger generations – fromPete Buttigieg,Josh Shapiro,Gretchen WhitmerandGavin Newsomto New York’s new star,Zohran Mamdani. They don’t yet have the shared platform that could win a presidential election, but thinkers such as Klein and Derek Thompson, co-authors ofAbundance,the other book of the moment, are already working up some good ideas. The Democrats can probably swing the House of Representatives in the midterm elections next year with a few fresh faces – and by focusing on the already visible negative consequences of Trump for working- and middle-class Americans. But by 2027, in the run-up to the next presidential election, they will need everything they so spectacularly failed to produce in 2023.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsJoe BidenOpinionDonald TrumpUS politicsDemocratsRepublicanscommentShareReuse this content"

Tucked away in a tiny cabin in the middle of nowhere, we lit fires, watched sunlight dip over the mountains; and, as avid birdwatchers, saw an abundance of avian life, nestled in the trees, awash with golden light.So at first, returning to our home in Sydney, where we live in a flat on a major street, triangulated between three different vape shops, my overwhelming feeling was one of despair. Gone were the rolling hills, replaced by convenience stores selling AI-generated posters of monkeys smoking cigars. Suddenly, everything I observed about city life became evidence for a growing theory that the human race had gone terribly, unavoidably wrong.Around this time, I stepped out on to the street and noticed a pigeon, nestled in the roof above my door. The green of the plumage around her neck glinted, a mossy river struck by a plume of light. She cooed, gently, and her partner fluttered up beside her, his beak filled with twigs, come to help build their nest, together.My pet rat is dying. I can’t stop thinking about all the things he taught me | Joseph EarpRead moreIf there is anything that defines modern life, it is how determinedly and constantly we are trained to not really see. We wake up and get to work ignoring things, like we’re being paid to do so. Human brains are naturally predisposed to ignoring the familiar, and focusing on the new, the different, the outrageous. Anything we’re surrounded by for too long grows invisible.The humble pigeon is that ethos poured into a feathery, fragile little body. Pigeons are noticed only when they seem particularly foul, paid mind only when they annoy us. They are also victim of rampant animal welfare crimes: pelted with rocks, chased from dwellings, killed and maimed en mass.Which is ironic, because, as it goes with so many problems we face, pigeons are a “problem” that we have caused. Feral pigeons are descendants of homing pigeons that we kept and domesticated. We loved them, once. We might not remember that, but pigeons do. They are naturally predisposed to want to be close to us. They gather where we gather. They thrive as a result of the particular way we have decided to live, rooting through our trash, taking shelter in our nests.And if pigeons are dirty or disgusting, they are that way becauseweare dirty and disgusting. Forgive me for excessive anthropomorphism, but we live in a natural world that, rightfully, flinches from human touch. Pigeons are one of the few creatures that don’t. And for that, we punish them.But if this makes it sound as though my burgeoning fascination with pigeons is guided by self-hatred, more despair, excessive fury at the way humans have decided to live, then I have miscommunicated. After noticing the nesting pigeons above my door, I began to actively look for them, everywhere. A few days later, walking home from work, I saw a flock of them huddled together, eating a discarded loaf of bread. Their overlapping cooing sounded like the movement of water. It was no northern Tasmania, but it was something.Everyone asks me about my plans for having children. A nest of noisy miner birds has taught me how to respond | Joseph EarpRead moreA pigeon deep-dive on Wikipedia that day brought me to an article,published in 1995, which informed me that pigeons are able to differentiate between paintings by Monet and Picasso. And I was moved not only by the image of a little bird, wandering between impressionist and cubist masterpieces, but the gentle, beautiful curiosity of humans too: that we can be interested enough in pigeons to want to know what they think about the art that we make.Another thing about human brains: we adore a binary. Human versus non-human. Nature versus the city. Regular versus exceptional. Just because we see something every day – just because it surrounds us – it doesn’t mean it’s any less remarkable for that. So often, we picture metropolises as places devoid of wildlife; even in our despair, we end up drawing arbitrary lines between us and the natural world. Humans are not alone. Somehow, even after all that we have done, we still have pigeons by our side, building their nests, quietly, heads down, as we build ours.Joseph Earp is a critic, painter and novelist.

There are no winners in divorce, but maybe, somehow, we can all be happyMon 4 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 07.08 EDTSharePaul Mooney, the late great African-American comedian and one of the most insightful yethilarious intellectualson matters of race, once quipped that every “racially aggrieved” person once deceased returns in another body to collect what is owed to them. Illustrating the point he suggested that the first Black Oscar winner,Hattie McDaniel(perhaps most famous for playing Mammy in Gone With the Wind), had returned to the world as Oprah Winfrey. If Mooney’s thesis is to be believed, there is amusement to be had guessing which figure from history has returned to us in the form of a newly “ex-Nigerian” Olukemi Olufunto Adegoke Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative partyAppearing on a podcast last week, Badenoch said that sheno longer identifiesas Nigerian. This was bizarre even by Badenochian standards. Her words: “I don’t identify with it [Nigeria] any more. Most of my life has been in the UK …” She went further: “I’m Nigerian through ancestry, by birth, despite not being born there because of my parents … but by identity, I’m not really.”The podcast presenter, the former Tory MP and all-round lovely chap Gyles Brandreth, deserves an award for not falling into a laughter-induced coma as Olukemi Olufunto desperately struggled with a self-imposed form of the late Norman Tebbit’s “whose side are you on anyway”cultural loyalty test.Badenoch isn’t a runaway favourite. Just today Liz Truss, momentarily the Tory leader, now the stuff of actual stand-up comedy,accused herof “repeating spurious narratives” about the economy. That’s a bit cats in a true blue sack: but, listening to the leader of the opposition, now and previously, on matters of race and identity, I do find her confused and confusing.For someone keen to shed the weight of Nigerian origins, she appears to make much of them, if negatively. Nigerians in the diaspora tend to obsess about three topics: making money, Premier League football andNigeria. Of this cohort, Badenoch sounds like a recent “Japa” (a person who migrated from Nigeria usually to the west) who just cannot stop talking about “back home”.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch talking about British immigration policy on Fareed Zakaria’s CNN show.Photograph: CNNA few months ago, the theme was ethnic enmity and corruption. Last month, doing the anti-immigration two-step onFareed Zakaria’s CNN show, she said her daughters were unable to attain Nigerian citizenship because “I am a woman”. That was sad: cue violins. But it’s also nonsense. The Nigerian constitutionconfers citizenship on to her childrenby dint of the fact that one of their parents or grandparents is Nigerian – which is actually more liberal and inclusive than the British approach to citizenship.It is infuriating that Badenoch tends not to do interviews with people with knowledge of Nigeria or even honest brokers on the Black experience in Britain. The result is that her more confusing pronouncements – such as the contention she “doesn’t like socialism” because of her experiences in Nigeria – go unchallenged. A clued-up interviewer might say: “I put it to you that Nigeria is one of the most brutally capitalist nations on Earth, one without any real welfare state. You actually grew up in a recently liberated former British colony that was struggling under the weight of history and IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes – the mother of all austerity regimes.” That’s why her response to even the prospect of an appropriate interviewer is to run a one-minute mile.On one level it’s all comedic, but it also seems sadly revealing. The colonial mindset that everything western is unquestionably superior is one that too many Nigerians have yet to discard: especially Nigeria’s political elite.Call it the Kemi Badenoch conundrum: it’s why the Tories are going nowhere fast | Henry HillRead moreThese interviews also reveal something significant about Britain and the Conservative party. She says these things in public, knowing there is a market for them. In Brandreth’s podcast, Badenoch says she has not experienced racial prejudice in the UK “in any meaningful form”, adding, “People didn’t treat me differently, and it’s why I’m so quick to defend the UK whenever there are accusations of racism.” That’s great for her – go Kemi. But it hardly describes the general Black experience – as we might hope someone with such a profile would do – or anything backed up by data. So she is spouting derogatory nonsense about her country of cultural origin and misleads about the country she calls home. If there is value to her public utterances, it is hard to discern what that is.These are trying times, but those of us who feel proudly able to carry multiple identities – enriched by that privilege and truth – will have to go on without Kemi. Nigerians will have to love her, accepting that love is unrequited. Black Britons will seek to know and understand her, even if she shows no obvious yen to know or understand them.And people can change: for the day will come when tickling rightwing tummies no longer works, and VIP Kemi returns to mundane Earth as Olukemi Olufunto Adegoke Badenoch. We’ll see what she says then.Nels Abbey is an author, broadcaster and the founder ofUppity: the Intellectual PlaygroundDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But until they are, adults can model the positive use of techDr Kaitlyn Regehr is the programme director of digital humanities at University College LondonMon 4 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 12.46 EDTShareThis summer the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, announcedhe was consideringa two-hour “screen time” cap on children’s use of social media apps – a proposal that is not just insufficient, it’s outdated.Though appropriately placed at the start of the summer holiday – a time when kids’ screen time can increase, along with the onus on parents to ensure the safety of such engagement – Kyle’s announcement is linked to somewhat stale screen time guidance. We should indeed be thinking about moderating time on screens, but the proposed cap addresses only the quantity of consumption, not the quality. Fortunately, as someone who lectures on digital literacy (and is a mother), I can tell you there are some ways to push back and create healthier habits for children this summer – even if the government doesn’t seem to have caught up with them yet.Limiting screen time has been the dominant digital guidance used by parents, educators – and all of us really – over the past decade. This advice emerged afterstudies indicatedthat increasing screen time could be a risk factor for being overweight/obesity in children and adolescents. This was, and is, good guidance to promote physical health. However, it didn’t include robust discussion about how the quality or nature of content online might be affecting mental health.For example, in following this guidance, you could have one child watching CBeebies with their family in a communal space, engaging in discussion; and another child wearing headphones and watching algorithmically driven YouTube shorts. Under “screen time” guidance, these two forms of viewing would be considered equal. But, of course, they are qualitatively very different. In this scenario, one child is engaged in interactive, collective viewing with a parent that might be a jumping-off point for discussion and connection. The other child’s viewing is isolated and fragmented; they are consuming short-form content, probably with little focus on meaningful storylines or characters, on a platform that is still, by comparison, unregulated.YouTubeis where much of our kids’ screen time is spent, and is nowthe most popular first TV destinationfor generation Alpha. A staggering88% of UK childrenaged three to 17 use the platform. And yet YouTube is often not included in discussions of social media bans, and nor was it mentioned in Kyle’s statement.There have been attempts to distinguish between types of screen time, such as “passive” and “active” engagement. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health haspushed for policyto focus on habits and behaviours. This might take into account “active screen time”, which involves cognitively or physically engaging in screen-based activities, such as playing games or completing homework on a computer, and “passive screen time”, which includes non-interactive viewing with low levels of intellectual and social engagement.Similarly, theAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatryrecommends familiarising yourself with what your child is watching and talking to them about it – and in ways that makes screen time more social, educational and creative. However, for the most part, these suggestions have not been fully embraced by the public or political zeitgeist.In encouraging more intentional choices about what and how kids are watching, I am not suggesting that heaping personal responsibility on to individuals is the answer. We are in the midst of a digital public health crisis. One that has prompted theUS surgeon general Vivek Murthy’sto suggest that social media increases the risk that children will experience symptoms of anxiety and depression. Bold policies that address the underlying technical and financial structures of these platforms are necessary. This is where Kyle should direct his attention.In the meantime, the proposals Kyle should be offering the public should not be limply drawn from outdated guidance. Proposals should be based on a deeper understanding around differing forms of usage. They should consider both physical and mental health concerns, and address systemic issues in the design of digital platforms. And crucially, they should take into account not just quantity, but also the quality of our children’s digital consumption.Until then, however, the onus of responsibility will fall primarily on individuals – in this case, on parents – to ensure their children are learning, engaged, active and safe. That sounds overwhelming. I know. If it helps, here are some of the things I’ll be doing with my kids during the summer holidays.For younger children, time off screens is generally better than on. However, when we do use screens, I encourage my own children to watch live TV on platforms such as CBeebies and CBBC, as this provides a diversity of content curated by a children’s programmer. Lots of time and advocacy has gone into producing it.Prioritise active and engaged viewing over passive viewing. This means content that encourages creativity and discussion. This supports active brain engagement, learning and communication skills. It’s often better to opt for collective over solitary viewing, which can act as a springboard for discussion and build critical thinking and social engagement skills.Begin seeding critical thinking about digital content from an early age. You can input questionable images into platforms such asSightengine, and they will tell you how likely each image is to be fake. This is a great way to start conversations about disinformation online.Speak to older children about what they want their digital diet to look like. Together, dedicate half an hour a week to training the machine learning by actively searching for positive content – content that they are passionate about or that makes them feel good. Don’t watch uninteresting, uninspiring content or content that makes them (or you) feel bad. Quickly move past it. And teach them not to like, share things or comment on things that they don’t like. Evencommenting on somethingyou don’t like counts as engagement, meaning you may get more of it.As a family, do an “uninspiring” clean. If it no longer inspires or educates you, unfollow it. This includes exes, TV personalities and brands. Do this regularly to clean up your feed and narrow in on what you do want to see.To combat targeted advertising, there are some Google alternatives you might want to look at as a family. DuckDuckGo or Firefox Focus are search engines that do not track you to serve targeted ads. You could also look atStartpage, which allows you to use Google without tracking your digital footprint.Governments may not be properly regulating this technology, but as parents, there are still things we can do. We can be more intentional about our screen use – and in doing so, begin to seed the ideas of healthy, critical screen engagement from an early age.Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is the programme director of digital humanities at University College London, lecturing on digital literacy and the ethical implications of social media and AI.

That’s a frightening recipe for more stasis and more rageMon 4 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 07.47 EDTShareAnew party has launched in the UK, and it didn’t take long for it to become the subject of frantic speculation. Will it split the left? Will it create more of an opening for Reform UK? Should itforge an alliancewith the Greens? The stunning speed with which Jeremy Corbyn’s new party amassed supporters, nowstanding at 600,000in a week, reasonably makes it feel like a real and viable thing. And the next logical step is to assess its chances in meaningfully challenging the mainstream. But the bigger question is, can the mainstream be meaningfully challenged, or is the future one of increasing fragmentation, with a persistent but tense monopoly on power by the political establishment?The signs that the centre is fraying at the margins became clear at the last general election. There was ahistorically low turnoutby share of the population (resulting in themost disproportionateelection outcome in history), Labour won its lowest share of the vote among those in deprived areas, and up came a new crop of independent MPs and Reform winners.Since then, the already “broad but shallow” mandate given to Labour has diminished even more, with approval ratings dropping the most for any governing party within its first year sinceJohn Major’s disasterin the 1990s. And internally, araft of suspensionsover the welfare reform bill continue to expose a party struggling even to maintain satisfaction within its own ranks. This is not a stable state of affairs, but it could very likely be a sustainable one. Because even as establishments rot and lose public support, they still benefit from scale and deep roots within the governing and electoral system – there’s a reason it’s called an “establishment”. Combine this with no proportional representation, and you have a situation where numbers do not necessarily translate into seats.Cycling between two mainstream parties, both out of ideas and solutions for everything from the cost of living to foreign policy, has led to a state of repetitive disaffection. The story in the US is the same. The Democrats were rejected for a second time in eight years in favour of Donald Trump, but Trump himself is now posting thelowest approval ratingof his second term. Neither centrists nor rightwingers can deliver, and yet their parties squat and sprawl on the site of government, with high barriers to entry precluding outside challenge and disincentivising internal reform. This is a recipe for permanent disconnect; failing governments, angry protest movements on the right and the left, quirky election results – and no change. Those individuals who break through, fromZohran Mamdaniin New York to independent MPs in the UK, instead of alerting the parties they are closest to that the political net must be widened, are in fact actively fought against. The most senior Democrats in the House of Representatives havestill not endorsedMamdani.View image in fullscreenJeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana on a picket line outside London Euston train station in 2022.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAAnd why would they if they can stay in their political comfort zone, then win again on their own terms when the disenchantment with Trump kicks in proper, and the cycle resets? In the meantime, the sort of vexation that coalesces around figures such as Mamdani and the UK’s new party means that they inherit a gigantic burden of expectation. It is one that is impossible to fulfil, because frustration with mainstream parties is so high that new ones, unless they become constant foghorns channeling feelings of anger rather than political projects, will have to constantly manage being the voice of outrage against the government, as well as working out how to be the alternative.Adding to the clamouring appetite for sharp challenge is a new information ecosystem where there are now more ways to dispute mainstream accounts of political reality. The process of fragmentation combined with persistent monopoly is one that is mirrored in the media. Over the past two years alone, entire outlets have grown and flourished over what it seems is the media’s inability to adequately capture and express anger over Gaza. From Zeteo (dubbed a “breakout hit”) toDrop Site News, which launched only a year ago, now has almost 400,000 subscribers and closely works with journalists in Gaza, there is a vast appetite for more uncompromising discourse and intimate coverage of the Middle East and complicity on Gaza.Still, this has not diminished anger at mainstream outlets because it is understood that these organisations still have enormous reach and therefore power over public opinion, and by extension political outcomes. It is why the New York Times’s reports on starvation in Gaza have been heavily contested by pro-Israeli government voices, as the paper holds huge authority in the one country that has power over Israel.Despite the chaos of its launch, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve | Andy BeckettRead moreBut all that residual power, from politics to the media, does not change the fact that something big is up for grabs – the default belief that these establishment institutions deserve their power, whether it can be taken away from them or not. Talk about new leftwing movements empowering Reform or the threat to the Labour government (talk that we have been hearing since before the last general election) misses the broader point – it’s too late. Labour is running on inertia, legacy, and historical and physical entrenchment, rather than active belief in the party. It has long given up on shaping public opinion, rather following, headless, what cynical politicians have forged, and economic and geopolitical realities have created. It is now a mutant party that is chasing Reform voters by trying (and failing) to outflank Nigel Farage, while trying to win over pro-Gaza opinion with a bizarre threat torecognise Palestineif Israel does not agree to a ceasefire. As well as trying to continue austerity while putting out the fires that it causes.There are two ways in which new parties and movements can produce results. The first is by actually being in government, and the second is by gathering enough support that they can apply pressure on government. The second is a more immediate and tangible way forward, but the problem is that the scale and range of what incumbent parties have failed to address, or take control of, is now too wide and polarised for any outside pressure to create breakthrough.The risk now is of a sort of permanent bifurcation. On the one hand, increasingly out-of-control hysteria on immigration empowers ghouls like Farage and makes them and their poisonous rhetoric permanent features of our lives and politics, while rage over Gaza and economic policies constantly clouds the political atmosphere. On the other, a government is caught in the headlights, unable to tackle anything, while also hoping that it’s too big to fail and its opponents too small and diverse to succeed. What if the problem isn’t that the centre cannot hold, but that it can, and in doing so brings about a new, volatile, miserable status quo of escalating rage and impotent government?Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionLabourReform UKJeremy CorbynZarah SultanacommentShareReuse this content"

They’re old racist tropes given a dangerous new lifeMon 4 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 00.01 EDTShareBeing a Muslim in a country with a long colonial history, which has also had to deal with terrorist attacks carried out in the name ofIslam, is an everyday challenge.In January 2015, for example, I was as profoundly shocked as everyone else in France by themassacre of the Charlie Hebdo journalistsin Paris. As the country mourned, I was invited by a major radio station to comment, but was first asked, live on air, to “dissociate” myself from the attackers.I had been critical of Charlie Hebdo’s publications in the past, but my comments always fell within the scope of legitimate political debate. Nevertheless, as a Muslim, I was now treated as if I was under suspicion. In order to be tolerated on the airwaves, I had to profess my innocence: state publicly that I had nothing to do with the violence.I couldn’t hold back my tears – because, even with a media profile, I was reduced to the most racist perception of my identity. I was strongly defended that night by others who took part in the show, and received much support online, but I couldn’t help thinking of the millions of French Muslims who, unlike me, would have no microphone to defend themselves against vile accusations.Some years later I was invited to take part in a TV debate on the thesis: is the white man always guilty. I was expecting a conversation about gender and race. But my opponent, the philosopher Pascal Bruckner, immediatelytook me to task, claiming that I had used my status “as a Black, Muslim woman” to incite hatred against Charlie Hebdo. He claimed that I had, in effect, blood on my hands, that my words had “led to the murder of 12 people at Charlie Hebdo”. I immediately protested, stating as firmly as I could, that I had “absolutely no responsibility for any terrorist attack”.But Bruckner wouldn’t let go. He attacked me for having signed ajoint statementin 2011, following a night-time petrol-bomb attack at the Charlie Hebdo premises that caused, fortunately, only material damage. Nothing in the statement – which I did not draft and was co-signed by 20 other academics and activists– had called for hatred or violence. It had been critical of the disproportionate media treatment of the fire at Charlie Hebdo when vandalism of Muslim places of worship featured rarely in the news. Signatories had expressed dismay at the selective nature of French national outrage, highlighting the indifference shown after an arson attack on a Paris building inhabited by Roma people, in which a man died.But Bruckner repeated his accusations in aninterviewthe next day, claiming without any evidence that he had simply “reminded Rokhaya Diallo of her involvement in political Islam” adding – as if it were a crime – that I had “criticised Charlie Hebdo by calling them Islamophobic and racist”.I felt I had no option but to file a defamation lawsuit against Bruckner, believing the accusation to be not just outrageous and insulting, but influenced by my origins and my faith. But defending myself was viewed as another provocation.Le Figaro, the leading conservative daily, publisheda highly offensive articleon the eve of the trial, which, without even bothering to interview me, stated: “Inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood, ‘anti-racist’ activists like Rokhaya Diallo are multiplying lawsuits to silence critics of Islamism.” Taking legal action as a Muslim woman was framed as a “jihadist” political plot.This kind of smear tactic is used again and again to discredit any Muslim who calls out Islamophobia. When the footballer Karim Benzema spoke in support of the people of Gaza in October 2023, the then interior minister Gerard Darmanindeclared– without a shred of evidence – that the player had “well-known ties to the Muslim Brotherhood”.View image in fullscreenKarim Benzema scores for Real Madrid against Barcelona, 5 April 2023.Photograph: Enric Fontcuberta/EPAIn May, areportcommissioned by the interior ministry into the Muslim Brotherhood fuelled suspicion of all French Muslims by recycling conspiracy theories around supposed “infiltration”. The report was as the the socio-anthropologistHamza Esmiliput it, “intellectually impoverished”.Yet Bruno Retailleau, the current interior minister, used alarmist conspiracy tropes todescribeits conclusions, claiming it had identified “a very clear threat to the republic and to national cohesion” and “a quiet form of Islamist infiltration whose ultimate goal is to bring all of French society under sharia law”.But even the report statedunequivocally: “No recent document demonstrates any intent by Muslims of France to establish an Islamic state in France or to enforce sharia law there.” It added that the Brotherhood’s members in France today are estimated to number “between 400 and 1,000 people”.As Esmili argues, French Muslims present a paradox: we are part of every social sphere, yet many of us have not given up our cultural specificities. And that is precisely what we are blamed for – integration without assimilation. This is why the same government can claim it uses the lawto fight against Muslim “separatism” while denouncing the threat of Muslim “infiltration”. Muslims can’t win: we are blamed for being part of the national community and for being outside of it.Thus, no matter what level we reach in the social pecking order, being Muslim always carries the suspicion of association with a radical and dangerous ideology: of being the enemy within.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As if an outfit was in itself proof of extremism. The influencer never mentioned her religion but it made no difference – her Algerian heritage alone was enough to disqualify her.Even non-Muslims who take a stand against this hostile climate are subjected to similar accusations. Emile Ackermann – a rabbi vocal on Islamophobia – wasaccusedby a self-proclaimed academic “expert” of being inspired by a “Brotherist” discourse. Such absurd accusations would be laughable if the situation weren’t so volatile, withIslamophobic crimeon the increase. Take the case of the hairdresser Hichem Miraoui, killed in June in the south of France, in what investigators are treating as aracially motivated act of domestic terrorism. Miraoui had been the target of racist rhetoric posted on social media by a neighbour who also denounced the French state as “incapable of protecting us from Muslims”.Yet, the very same state constantly fuels a narrative portraying Muslims as a problem.During the defamation lawsuit I launched against Bruckner, and its appeal, my accuser and his lawyer leaned into these cliches. While the philosopher repeated his accusations and suggested that I was funded by “foreign powers”, his lawyer told the court that, given that Charlie Hebdo’s case files amounted to several tonnes of documents, no one could say for sure whether my name was not mentioned in them.Elyamine Settoul, a political scientist and expert on jihadism, testified, however, that terrorists are radicalised through direct contacts and in no way rely on intellectual debates or interventions.And the expert andformer Islamic State hostage Nicolas Hénintestified that my name appeared “neither in the legal proceedings concerning the January 2015 attack, nor in the research conducted on the subject”. He told the court that “the jihadist sphere holds nothing but contempt” for people like me because of my “multicultural progressivism, which aligns with none of their religious doctrines”.Bruckner was acquitted in the first instance on the grounds that he had attributed to me only “purely moral responsibility” and invited me to “take ownership of the weight of my words and commitments”. The appeal court overturned the initial judgment, recognising the defamatory nature of Bruckner’s remarks, yet still acquitted him on the grounds that he had made his statement “in good faith”.Just like the “yellow peril” once attributed to east Asians, or the supposed “cosmopolitanist” trope used about Jews, the image of an allegedly foreign group secretly infiltrating France’s circles of influence is once again thriving, in a sadly familiar strain of dangerous racist rhetoric.Rokhaya Diallo is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionIslamophobiaEuropeIslamReligioncommentShareReuse this content"

And it felt like a collective wave of energy, hope and determination against institutional and governmental intransigence, denial, obfuscation and enabling that has so many of us feeling despairing, disgusted and disquieted.Why aren’t they listening? How is this horror continuing unabated with impunity? Why won’t Australia impose sanctions and call for arms embargos against Israel’s senseless murder of civilians, unleashed by some of the most methodical and lethal autonomous weaponry on Earth andAI machinesdirecting bombs, as claimed by intelligence sources?As doctors, aid workers and social media feeds document the livestreamed ruins of cities, we watch the killing of children, peoplekilled in tentswhile sleeping, starving people fired upon andkilled at aid stations,forced by their hungerto play Russian roulette with their lives.Sixty thousand human souls, around half of them women and children, dead and tens of thousands more maimed, injured without mercy or relief. Twenty one months of a nightmare for Palestinians that beggars belief.The horror of Gaza called and a mass of rain-soaked Sydney Harbour Bridge marchers, young and old, came in full forceRead moreA year of protests on Sundays at Hyde Park fountain feels like secular church to me, group therapy where I meet with my Readers Against Genocide group, listen to Palestinian leaders and collectively bang pots, grieve and wonder why some weeks the protests feel smaller than others. We lament colleagues doxed, fired, threatened, stripped of funding, forced to resign.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAs Israel breaks new records in the number of journalists killed – at least225 Palestinian journalistwitness bearers, according to the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate – we try to brace ourselves against a growing climate of fear and intimidation prevailing in Australian arts, media and academia, where Orwellian tone policing codes dominate. It’s not the killing, but speaking out and protesting against these violations, and the manner it is done, that is absurdly surveilled and seen as a source of harm and violence, and is met with censure and punishment.Sunday felt different. The whole city turned up, not just students and activists, but middle class grandmothers and parents with prams. What was most striking were the children. Parents with toddlers astride their shoulders, holding little ones gently by the hand as they stood patiently in raincoats in the crowds, or cradling their small sleeping heads on their shoulders, holding signs, all saying the same thing: killing and starving children, children just like ours, is wrong and we do not consent.We do not consent toNew South Walespremier Chris Minns’ beefed up protest laws that presaged former Greens candidate Hannah Thomas allegedly being punched in the face, leaving her at one stage at risk of being blinded in one eye. We do not consent to a vast population being killed by starvation and malnourishment as Israel deliberately blocks plentiful supplies of life-saving food and aid.For the first time in two years, I felt like I was in the majority. It also gave the majority a picture of what these maligned and villainised protests really are: peaceful, powerful, loving declarations of freedom and democracy in action.As police helicopters buzzed overhead, and police text messages and speaker phones blasted messages that the bridge opening to the north was now blocked and to go back, it felt like a divide was both breached and dissolved. In a city of wealth divided – geographic, cultural and economic – where your postcode can determine your future, it felt like there was no more wealthy, white east, ethnic west, Shire south or privileged north. There was just a collective us.Emboldened and peaceful crowds kept calm through the confusion, moving with strength and power like a colourful cloud of umbrellas over this harbour city. There was no stopping this tide, and it’s a message that our governments, media and arts leaders need to take heed of: they can no longer isolate and censure the dissenting voices in their ranks, because behind them swell millions.Sarah Malik is a journalist and author of Desi Girl: On Feminism, Race, Faith and Belonging and Safar: Muslim Women’s Stories of Travel and TransformationExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionSydneyIsrael-Gaza warProtestNew South WalescommentShareReuse this content"

Can’t Look Away tells a devastating story of bereft parents trying to hold the likes of Snapchat to accountCath ClarkeMon 4 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 11.27 EDTShareIn 2020, Amy Neville found her 14-year-old son Alexander dead in his bedroom. He had taken what he thought was an oxycodone pill, bought – according to Neville – from a drug dealer he met on Snapchat. The pill was a fake, laced with fentanyl. Four years later, his mum stood up in the California high school where Alex would have been a student to warn other parents and teenagers about social media. “We give our kids these smartphones. We let them have these apps. And that is the equivalent of dropping them off in the worst neighbourhood in our area.”Neville is featured alongside other bereaved parents in Can’t Look Away, a terrifying new documentary about kids and social media directed by Matthew O’Neill and Perri Peltz, based on extensive investigative reporting by Bloomberg News journalist Olivia Carville. It follows American families who are filing lawsuits against social media companies and campaigning for stricter legislation; they are represented by the Social Media Victims Law Center, a crusading legal firm run Matthew Bergman, a lawyer so charismatic he could probably play himself in a Hollywood movie.The directors ask if the kids have ever watched a suicide. Almost every hand goes upThe conversation around teenagers and social media has evolved beyond kids using their phones at the table.In his 2024 bestseller The Anxious Generation, Jonathan Haidt warned of the links betweenyoung people’s mental health and smartphones. Last month, the technology secretary Peter Kyle apologised for the delay in legislation to keep children safe online.Australia plans to ban social media for under 16s from December.In Can’t Look Away, the agony on parents’ faces as they tell their stories, and relive the trauma, is hard to watch. Toney and Brandy Roberts filed a lawsuit against Meta over the death of their 14-year-old daughter Englyn in 2020; she killed herself after watching a video of a mock-hanging on Instagram. “The social media companies know that our children are so vulnerable,” Brandy tells the camera. “I feel that the only way that they’re going to be forced to change is through a lawsuit. So that’s why we’re joining this fight.”‘The tide has turned’: why parents are suing US social media firms after their children’s deathRead moreWhen I talk to the film’s directors before Can’t Look Away’s UK premiere, they do not mince their words. O’Neill says he previously had no idea how extreme the content that children are exposed to on social media is. “It’s so much more than just addiction, or screen time, or wasting time. What young people see is so different because of the algorithms. What they’re being fed, what they can’t look away from, this is not what they’re searching for. Children are essentially entering into a hellscape that adults don’t know about.”Algorithms decide what you see on social media, based in part on what you have previously liked or commented on, and how much time you’ve spent on other posts. If you linger on a piece of content, the algorithm will feed you more of the same. What that means is that teenagers don’t have to actively search for harmful material for it to appear in their feed. A 13-year-old girl might look for healthy eating advice and end up down a rabbit hole of pro-anorexia content. “It can very quickly turn very dark,” says O’Neill.Mason Edens was 16 when he broke up with his girlfriend; normal teenage stuff his mum Jennie DeSerio thought. In his heartache, Mason turned to TikTok, searching for phrases such as: “My girlfriend broke up with me.” In the film, his mum plays one of the depressing videos that ended up in his feed. It shows a gun in a hand, then an image of blood splatter and the words: “My hand. My head.” Mason killed himself in November 2022. Jennie doesn’t believe that he’d ever searched for the term “suicide” on TikTok.O’Neill says he was shocked by Mason’s feed: “This is not someone crying. It’s not just sad music. It is an image of a gun going into a hand with the exhortation to blow your effing head off. That is not content that a product should be feeding to a child. I think we could all broadly agree on that as a society.”Is it possible, I ask, for the social media companies to filter out harmful content? “If Meta knows what I want to buy before I buy it, there’s no way they can’t figure out how to make sure children aren’t fed content that demonstrates how to die by suicide.”View image in fullscreen‘It can turn dark very quickly’ … the directors of the documentary, Matthew O’Neill and Perri Peltz.Photograph: Bryan Derballa/Getty ImagesAfter screenings of Can’t Look Away, the film-makers often ask the kids in the audience if they have ever watched a suicide on social media. “Almost all the hands go up,” says co-director Peltz.In America, 95% of 13 to 17-year-olds use social media. In 2022, social media companies made an estimated $11bn from advertising directed to under 18s in the US. The longer kids are glued to it, the more billions the companies make, which means there is a huge incentive to design sticky algorithms, says Peltz. “Why are they feeding children material that they can’t look away from? Because it keeps children on their sites for as long as possible. And we know from whistleblowers that that is a business plan. This is not an accident. They are prioritising time on screen over safety.”The film features interviews with such whistleblowers, who say companies have been warned that their products harm children. Arturo Béjar held senior positions at Facebook and Instagram, and became increasingly alarmed by their parent company Meta’s own research. In one poll, one in eight 13 to 15-year-olds said they had received an unwanted sexual advance on Instagram in the past week. Béjar emailed his concerns to Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg and other top executives. He says he never received a reply.Can’t Look Away tells the heart-breaking story of Jordan DeMay, a popular, outgoing 17-year-old from Michigan who killed himself after being blackmailed in a sextortion scam. In March 2022, he received a message on Instagram from someone he thought was a girl his own age. After some flirting, Jordan sent her nude photographs. Immediately, the threats started: send money or we’ll share the photos with your friends and family. Less than six hours after the first of these messages, Jordan was dead.Sextortion is one of the fastest growing cybercrimes. Peltz is keen to share with parents the advice she has picked up from several professionals about how to protect children. “Talk to your child. Tell them, ‘If this ever happens to you, do not be afraid to come to us.’ It’s very specific advice that can make a major difference.”View image in fullscreenShowdown … parents demonstrate outside the HQ of Snap Inc, the maker of Snapchat.Photograph: Courtesy: Can’t Look AwayCan’t Look Away ends with some real-life courtroom drama in Los Angeles. Amy Neville, the woman whose son took the fake oxycodone pill, is the lead plaintiff in a case against Snapchat by parents whose children died or were injured after allegedly buying fentanyl-laced drugs. Their lawsuit claims that Snapchat’s design makes it an ideal marketplace to sell illegal drugs, with its disappearing messages that make it difficult for police to trace illegal activity. Another feature is Quick Add, which suggests other users to add. Laura Marquez-Garrett is a lawyer at the Social Media Victims Law Center and explains how it works. “[A dealer will] just find one high school kid in your area. You add them, and then you add all their friends, and then you addtheirfriends.”In a courtroom showdown, Snap Inc’s defence relies on a piece of US legislation drafted before Zuckerberg hit puberty. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has for years acted as a shield (or a get-out-of-jail card, depending on your perspective) protecting social media companies from liability for user-generated content posted on their platforms. In court, Snap Inc’s attorney describes the platform as a tech-service provider, like a phone company. You wouldn’t sue a phone company if a drug deal was made over the phone. The back-and-forth between the lawyers and the judge is a gripping intellectual tennis match.‘No smartphones before 14; no social media until 16’: The Anxious Generation author on how to fight back against big techRead morePeltz tells me that parents often feel powerless. “But this is not a blame-the-parents situation. Companies need to make the changes so that these sites are responsible and are safe for children to be on. Parents can’t be expected to keep up with their children when it comes to digital advances. It’s time for these companies to stop blaming parents.”As for teenagers, people can be judgmental, she says. “I think it’s human nature to say, ‘Well my child wouldn’t buy drugs online.’ Or, ‘My child couldn’t be sextorted.’ The answer is that we can all hope that our children won’t do things like that. But children are children. We all know about the frontal cortex, that it doesn’t get fully developed until your 20s. Children make mistakes. They should be allowed to make mistakes and not have to die as a result.”Can’t Look Away: The Case Against Social Media is in UK cinemas and streaming onjolt.filmfrom 8 AugustIn the UK, the youth suicide charityPapyruscan be contacted on 0800 068 4141 or emailpat@papyrus-uk.org, and in the UK and IrelandSamaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

I had limited time before my daughter went back to school and having that deadline was a very good thing.I’d always liked ghost stories – MR James and so on – but they were always short. Many are unsatisfactory because they have a buildup, then scramble to an end, and that’s it. I thought there ought to be more than that. But it is hard to sustain tension and fear over a longer book. You can’t just have somebody being terrified every chapter.I made a list of the essential ingredients, beginning with a ghost. I remember writing down “weather”: I loved reading ghost stories that began in foggy conditions. The setting then had to be isolated, a place where nobody would talk about this thing – a conspiracy of silence.I always write by hand. The medical student said: “My sister’s doing a typing course and is looking for things to type.” I sent her the first few chapters but she came back saying her sister couldn’t read my handwriting. She suggested a Dictaphone so I bought a cheapo recorder and read into that. Then she came back and said: “My sister says it’s going to be a bit slow because she is too frightened to do it when she is alone in the house.”Inner-city boys have a look on their faces that says: 'Go on – frighten me.' In 10 minutes, they’re clutching each otherThat sister was Jane Tranter, who went on to be controller of drama commissioning at the BBC. She still remembers it. She said: “I could not listen to it because your voice got very sinister when it was reading certain bits.”The book was published in 1983 and the play opened four years later in Scarborough, where I was born and brought up. The adaptation complemented the book: in a small theatre, it’s like you are the reader alone in the house. I’ve occasionally sat at the back of the theatre at a matinee and watched these inner-London boys of 16 with a look on their faces that says: “Go on then – frighten me.” It takes about 10 minutes and then they all start clutching each other. They change completely.View image in fullscreen‘My voice got very sinister in certain bits’ … writer Susan Hill.Photograph: David Crump/Daily Mail/ShutterstockRobin Herford, directorIn the late summer of 1987, I was working at the Stephen Joseph theatre in Scarborough while Alan Ayckbourn was away at the National. I got to the end of my second year and found I had £5,000 of the budget left. I thought I’d do an extra show over Christmas and figured a ghost story might be a good idea. We had enough money for four actors and we could do it in the bar, where you can get 70 seats in.Stephen Mallatratt, the resident playwright, wasn’t terribly impressed by my idea but he came back a few days later and said: “Have you read The Woman in Black?” I’m a wimp as far as horror is concerned, but this was a human story about a woman who was forced to give up her baby. I was blown away by it, but it had 15 characters. “You haven’t been listening, Stephen!” I told him.He said: “I’ve had an idea about that. I might even be able to give you some change.”He proceeded to write an adaptation for three actors: Jon Strickland, Dominic Letts and Lesley Meade. The designer, Michael Holt, came up with the idea of using gauze: if you light it from one side you can’t see through it, but from the other, it’s transparent. It gave us one of the first rough-magic tools. It’s embarrassingly simple. You can do an extraordinary amount with very little. I commandeered the bar’s kitchens for my five Revox reel-to-reel tape machines, so we could do the sound without hearing “clunk, click”.If I’d had a decent budget, I could have done a super production – but it wouldn’t have engaged the imaginationWe sold out almost immediately. I put in extra midnight performances and there was quite a buzz about it. It’s rare to really frighten a theatre audience, so it surprised us in Scarborough when people said: “I didn’t sleep for three nights after seeing your show.”A year to the day after opening in Scarborough, we had the read-through for the first London production, which opened at the Lyric Hammersmith in January 1989. Had I had a decent budget, instead of mopping up £5,000’s worth of local authority grant, I could have done a super production, but it wouldn’t have engaged the imagination and wouldn’t have run atthe Fortune theatre in London for 33 years. Since then, it has starred actors including Frank Finlay, Edward Petherbridge, Joseph Fiennes and Martin Freeman and I’ve seen tough rugby-playing men cowering amid the screams in the auditorium.The Woman in Blackis touringfrom 24 September to 18 April, beginning at Storyhouse, ChesterExplore more on these topicsTheatreHow we madeStephen Joseph theatreHorror booksSusan HillFictionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Judging by this fringe hour, he’d be welcome to it. Common Knowledge is a hymn of praise to O’Donnell’s new home, Ireland, where she and her child Clay moved at the time of Trump’s inauguration. Clay, who is non-binary, is the other focus of the show, and of their mum’s rapturous affections, in a set that’s more a love letter to these two presences in the 63-year-old’s life than it is let-it-rip comedy.The show is bookended by reflections on O’Donnell’s mother, whose death when our host was 10 years old is recounted in a solemn opening. Now a parent to five adopted children, motherhood is clearly a major concern of the comedian, and here we get the whole story, with a slide show, of how Clay arrived in her life. Autistic, prodigiously intelligent, fearlessly truth-telling, this is a child who dismays and instructs their mother in equal measure. That cycle supplies the show’s rhythm: we get the funny story about Clay’s behaviour, then the earnest lesson O’Donnell has derived from it.Desiree Burch: The Golden Wrath review – uproarious tales of a midlife cataclysmRead moreThat, combined with a sonorous and sentimental quality to the storytelling, can make Common Knowledge more sermon than standup. At points, it’s a rallying call for autism awareness. Elsewhere, it plays like a heartfelt thank you to Ireland (which she keeps referring to as “here”) for saving the New Yorker from depression and the disintegrating US, with O’Donnell starry-eyed at how safe, cheap and progressive her perfect new homeland seems to be. But the earnestness is regularly punctured with self-mocking comedy, as with the tale of Rosie and her then teenage son’s joint visit to her therapist; or the story of her mistaking the friendliness of her new Irish pharmacist for flirtation, with humiliating consequences.There’s no standup cut and thrust to this: O’Donnell cleaves tightly to her script and stately delivery. But the tale she’s telling means a lot to her and she tells it authoritatively, and with enough irony, self-reflection and (Trump, take note) humanity – to make it engaging for the rest of us.AtOrchard at the Gilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 10 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Viewers are all enjoying the One Day-meets-High Fidelity vibes ofBBC Two’s nostalgic romance Mix Tape. However, none of them can stand the cassette-crossed lovers’ spouses. Yes, for every role that becomes a firm viewer favourite, another is reviled by the show’s fanbase. Lena Dunham’s latest creation, Too Much, seems to be entirely populated by unappealing characters.Meanwhile, Peppa Pig devotees are in a porcine pickle over the imminent onscreenarrival of a new little sister, baby piglet Evie. Cartoon swine devotees fear this gimmicky addition will upset the delicate balance of the four-way family unit that has been beloved by preschoolers for 21 years.

All Rights ReservedVanity Fair dubbed the character “divisive”. The New York Times called them “polarising”. Just two of the euphemisms for being downright awful. As Miranda’s love interest in the Sex and the City sequel, so-called comedian Che was much maligned as an unsubtle caricature of a non-binary person. The character simply made no sense, let alone as a match for the hitherto heterosexual Miranda. They spoke as if they had swallowed a gender studies textbook. They laughed at their own non-jokes. They generally jarred with fans. Some feel similarly about Carrie’s rekindled relationship with Aidan, with his mullet, whispery tones and cringe-inducing phone sex. Shudder.Bran Stark(Game of Thrones)View image in fullscreenWidely reviled … Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) in Game of Thrones.Photograph: Courtesy of HBOThat noise isn’t dire wolves; it’s howls of protest from fans. The problematically named “Bran the Broken” spent most of HBO’s fantasy saga on the sidelines – wearing furs, sitting in trees and making gnomic pronouncements like a creepy schoolkid in the corner of the playground. He even disappeared for an entire season and wasn’t much missed. No wonder it was, ahem, “controversial” when this passive fringe figure was suddenly picked as Ruler of the Six Kingdoms. A widely reviled choice.Uncle Albert (Only Fools and Horses)With mega-rated Christmas specials and a dodgy lock-up full of lovely jubbly catchphrases, the Trotter brothers once ruled the sitcom roost. Cushty. While they ducked ’n’ dived around Peckham, Grandad rarely left his armchair in Nelson Mandela House but added a bass note of world-weary, hat-clad, croaky-voiced craftiness. When the actor Lennard Pearce died in 1984, he was replaced by the wackier Uncle Albert – a salty old sea dog with Captain Birds Eye’s beard and precisely one joke, which was starting every sentence with “During the war … ” The decline began, hastened by Del finding love with Raquel and Rodders falling for Cassandra.

Lemme at ’em, Uncle Scoob! Scrappy dappy Doo!” Pipe down, you insufferable brat. When the Hanna-Barbera cartoon suffered a ratings slump, producers brought in Scooby’s rambunctious nephew to join the ghost-hunting gang as an uncalled-for comic foil. The annoying ankle-biter sparked an immediate backlash. “Zoinks,” indeed. Scrappy was so hated that The Simpsons mocked him with the rapping, surfing Poochie in cartoon-within-a-cartoon The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show.Emily Waltham(Friends)View image in fullscreenUnfunny wet blanket … Helen Baxendale (right) with David Schwimmer and Jennifer Aniston in Friends.Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyCrowbarring a token British actor into an American show rarely works. So it proved when Helen Baxendale earned a big-money transfer from Cold Feet to Friends. Intended to turn the Ross ’n’ Rachel saga into a love triangle, Emily was an unfunny wet blanket who just got in the way. She spent most of her screen time storming out of rooms in jealous huffs. Her arrival led to the ropy London episodes, complete with cameos from Sarah Ferguson and Richard Branson. Emily’s sole saving grace: the gasp-inducing moment when Ross accidentally said Rachel’s name at the altar.

Did it really need to turn one of its supporting characters into an unconvincing panto villain? Shortly after arriving to manage AFC Richmond, our titular hero spotted the kit man’s tactical nous, promoted him to assistant coach and nicknamed him Nate the Great. How did Nate repay him? By demanding all the credit for Richmond’s success, bullying colleagues and mocking his mentor’s panic attacks – before leaving to manage the club’s arch rival. Nate the Grate, more like.The Moon family(Frasier)Physiotherapist-cum-housekeeper Daphne Moon may have been lovable, but whenever her family from back home in Blighty turned up, it was painful to behold. Her brother Simon was a regular visitor to Seattle, appearing in nine episodes as a boozy, boorish numpty, but the actor Anthony LaPaglia inexplicably spoke in a ropy cockney accent, rather than a more logical Mancunian one. Even more inexplicably, he won an Emmy for the role. Equally bad was their battleaxe mother, Gertrude (Millicent Martin).Dana Brody (Homeland)View image in fullscreenSoapy teens … Morgan Saylor as Dana Brody with Timothée Chalamet as Finn Walden in Homeland.Photograph: Kent Smith/ShowtimeThe Showtime series was a tense, knotty espionage thriller about the cat-and-mouse relationship between CIA spook Carrie Mathison and Marine-turned-al-Qaida sleeper agent Sgt Nicholas Brody. Homeland wasn’t an angsty teen soap. Yet this is exactly what it turned into during scenes involving Brody’s sulking, whining daughter Dana. She at least met her petulant match in the vice-president’s hit-and-run driver son Finn, played by a 16-year-old Timothée Chalamet. Wonder what happened to that guy? In other “annoying offspring of TV action men” news, see Jack Bauer’s daughter Kim from 24 – notably when she got trapped in a snare and menaced by a wild cougar. Dammit, Jack!Andy Bernard (The Office US)The Office: An American Workplace wasn’t just a rare US remake worthy of the British original. It became a truly great sitcom in its own right. Cracks appeared, however, when Dunder Mifflin boss Michael Scott departed and preppy sales rep Andy Bernard was promoted to regional manager. Arrogant and anger prone, he lacked Michael’s bumbling humanity and drained the show of its gentle charm. It was like replacing David Brent with Finchy.Henrik Sabroe(The Bridge)View image in fullscreenHandsome but haunted … Thure Lindhardt as Henrik Sabroe in The Bridge.The first two series of the border-straddling Nordic noir were all-timers, following the unlikely duo of neurodiverse Swedish sleuth Saga Norén and her slobby, sarky Danish counterpart Martin Rohde. When the second run ended with Martin jailed, Saga needed a new sidekick, hence the arrival of the handsome but haunted Henrik. The pair soon entered into a relationship (eyeroll). With more focus on the detectives’ private lives, the crime drama lost its way. Back to Sarah Lund’s jumpers, then.Elsbeth Tascioni(The Good Wife)View image in fullscreenKooky … Carrie Preston as Elsbeth Tascioni in The Good Wife.Recurring character Elsbeth was a Chicago defence attorney for whom words such as “quirky” and “kooky” might have been invented. All “I’m so random!” pronouncements and primary-coloured outfits, she was a tryhard irritant who somehow became a fan favourite. Amid the high-class legal drama, it felt as if she had wandered in from a tonally different, inferior show. Which she then got, landing her own spin-off, the Ronseal-titled Elsbeth. There’s no accounting for taste.Cousin Oliver (The Brady Bunch)View image in fullscreenSpawned a syndrome … Cousin Oliver (Robbie Rist) in The Brady Bunch.The disastrous introduction of this previously unmentioned Brady family member coined the US terms “Cousin Oliver syndrome” and “add-a-kid” – shorthand for a failed bid to boost flagging ratings with a supposedly cute child. This blond, bespectacled devil spawn is among the most hated characters in sitcom history. Six episodes after Oliver’s arrival, ABC axed the show. A decade later came another example: Sam, the bowl-cut best friend of Gary Coleman’s Arnold, who joined the Diff’rent Strokes cast for its final two series. It might take diff’rent strokes to move the world, but Sam could do one.The Man in Black(Lost)View image in fullscreenOut to confuse … Titus  Welliver as The Man in Black, AKA John Locke, in Lost.Photograph: PRThe pointless polar bear.

There were many points at which the plane crash drama disappeared up its own rear propeller but the clincher came when a middle-aged man in black became the personification of evil. He had previously appeared as the Smoke Monster, then was able to inhabit the dead. He turned out to be the villainous twin of the mysterious Jacob, white-clad protector of “The Heart of the Island”.

But compelling new evidence suggests the colonel was actually devoted to the starEamonn FordeMon 4 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 05.32 EDTShareAhuckster. A Svengali. A bully. The public perception of Elvis Presley’s manager Colonel Tom Parker has long positioned him as a byword for duplicitous artist representation, where profitability trumps art and the artist always loses out on the lion’s share.You can see why. Born Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk, even the name Colonel Tom Parker was a confection and an invention. Therefore, the presumption runs, so was he. But in The Colonel and the King, a new biography of Parker, Peter Guralnick dispels many of these presumptions to present a far more nuanced portrait of a highly moral operator.Guralnick knows the intricacies of this story more than anyone, except perhaps the colonel and Presley themselves, having written two doorstopper biographies of the singer (1994’s Last Train to Memphis and 1999’s Careless Love). His Parker biography is no less hefty, running close to 600 pages.View image in fullscreenDischarged … Presley laughs as he hands Parker his mustering out pay.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveIt is split in two: the first half a biography; the second half a selected republishing of some of the tens of thousands of letters, memos and telegrams Parker produced and archived through his career. Guralnick was given total access to all this correspondence and was able to see the inner workings and strategic thinking of the man behind the public myth.Researching the book, Guralnick reappraised everything he previously thought about Parker to give him “his rightful place in history”, expressing the tricky balancing act of the biographer. “I intended not to excuse him,” he says, “nor to condemn him.”Parker had the tools either to disarm me or to keep me at arm’s length. He was always five steps aheadParker was born in Breda in the Netherlands in 1909 and came to America illegally in the 1920s without documentation. Thereafter he rewrote his own history, claiming he was born in Huntington, West Virginia. He enlisted in the US military from 1929 and then worked the carnivals before managing musical acts such as Hank Snow, Gene Austin and Eddy Arnold. His Damascene moment was seeing Presley on the Louisiana Hayride in January 1955, understanding instantly he would be a new type of star and that Parker should steer him there.He officially took over Presley’s management in March 1956 and represented a new breed of manager who prized art over commerce. His and Presley’s fates, their successes and their tensions became locked together until Presley’s death in 1977.“This is a completely different person to the one people assume him to be,” says Guralnick, who first met Parker in 1988 and regularly corresponded with him. “He was brilliant and he was funny,” he says of Parker’s playful self-mythologising but wily self-protectionism. “He had the tools either to disarm me or to keep me at arm’s length. He was always five steps ahead.”Parker fully understood his role was to make who he called “the boy” a star while being the bulwark preventing his record label, his live agents and Hollywood in their ambition to “blandify Elvis”. Presley was his own sole creative arbitrator. Parker rarely offered advice on staging and gave no advice on song choices or recording. “Elvis was his artist. He embraced the music because he embraced the artist.”View image in fullscreenElvis performing in Tampa, Florida, in 1955.Photograph: (c) Graceland ArchivesArtist management often involves some level of stage management.Brian Epsteinput the Beatles in suits.Andrew Loog Oldhamungroomed the Rolling Stones.Malcolm McLaren, in his mind at least, was puppet-master of the Sex Pistols. Parker, however, rarely meddled. “Elvis was somebody Parker observed as capable of infinite growth,” says Guralnick. Parker rarely lost his temper and worked 16-18 hours a day, seven days a week, for Elvis. His devotion was total.I ask Guralnick if he thinks Parker’s background in the carnival (historically its people were viewed with suspicion as peripatetic outsiders) or as an immigrant was a factor in the public’s prejudicial interpretation of him. He suggests Parker actually leaned into that rather than flinched from it. “Nobody was either more American or more self-created than Tom Parker,” he argues. His entire American life was one of myth-building.One Las Vegas run for Elvis was renegotiated on a tablecloth in a hotel coffee shop. Parker was asked to consider some “other goodies” (an under-the-table deal) but flatly refused. “Everything is on top of the table or forget it,” insisted Parker. “We don’t do business that way.”The negative view of Parker really only developed afterthe death of Elvis. From the mid-1950s to the mid-70s, Parker was “almost universally” admired in the music and film industries, suggests Guralnick. “I talked to a lot of people over the years who did business with Parker and who said you could trust him implicitly,” he says.Parker believed that all business deals should come with unshakeable morality. “He schooled Hank Saperstein [who handled Presley’s merchandise] on the ethics of business,” says Guralnick, pointing to letters Parker sent instructing Saperstein on how to treat staff and manufacturers fairly.Parker was able to persuade RCA to pay over the odds to buy Presley out of his Sun Records contract in 1955, shelling out $35,000 (plus thousands more in back royalties) when the more established artistFrankie Lainehad been bought out by Columbia for $25,000 in 1951. He also renegotiated Presley’s contract with RCA as soon as the hits started rolling in, significantly improving his terms after just 11 months.Aware of Presley’s incorrigible spending and monumental tax burden (they both saw paying high taxes as patriotic), Parker set up an emergency bank account with $1m in case Presley spent his way into trouble. He was also a regular “fixer” for friends in Presley’s “Memphis Mafia”, quietly stepping in to clean up their mess so that the star would avoid the blowback.View image in fullscreenBig money … at the RCA contract signing in 1955 with Parker, left, and Presley’s parents Gladys and Vernon either side of him.Photograph: (c) Graceland ArchivesParker was, however, a gambling addict, losing as much as $800,000 in one Vegas sitting. Both figures shared a love of spending. “Elvis wasn’t interested in accumulating money – he simply spent it,” insists Guralnick. “And the colonel was no more interested in accumulating money. He lost it at the gaming table.”Parker remained loyal to Presley long after his death, despite having been removed from his business affairs by the family estate in 1983. He did not manage another act after Presley, although he did offer advice toCeline Dionearly in her career. It was not that he felt he was an anachronism, more that he believed he had achieved everything a manger could with the biggest star in the world. To Parker every other act and every other deal would be inferior.Guralnick says: “The letters gave me a window into what was behind the public statements,” and his book is less an uncritical laundering of Parker’s reputation and more a timely recalibration of it.Perhaps the biggest myth about Parker was that he trapped Presley into drecky Hollywood films as a proxy for touring internationally because Parker feared being deported. Guralnick, however, suggests he could easily have secured a US passport through his marriage to a US citizen. Plus he was close friends with President Lyndon B Johnson. Why he did not go through the paperwork to do so remains a mystery.Parker’s letters show that he was seriously considering touring Presley globally up until 1960 and in 1973 was looking into a possible Japanese tour. Guralnick says the real reason Elvis never played outside of the US was not due to Parker but Elvis himself. The star was never that interested, but it was primarily down to his addiction to amphetamines and other drugs, as well as his propensity for carrying guns, making crossing borders impossible for him. Parker expressed concern about getting the right security to protect Presley. “What he was talking about was the security to keep Elvis from being busted. Who was going to carry the drugs, which went with Elvis everywhere? Who was going to carry the guns?”View image in fullscreen‘An introvert who acted like an extrovert’ … Parker and second wife Loanne.Photograph: (c) Graceland ArchivesPresley and the Colonel were complexly woven together, but Guralnick found letters where Parker admitted he was never part of Presley’s social circle, yet seemed at peace with that. They almost separated in 1973 after a falling out in Vegas, yet Parker’s letters from this time calmly outline how they could neatly sever the partnership. “I have no ill feelings,” he wrote, “but I am also not a puppet on a string.”It did not come to that because their mutual dependency was so great, as was their mutual admiration. A rare telegram from Presley on signing the original RCA deal told Parker: “I love you like a father.” But this was more than a paternal relationship. There was, Guralnick feels, a deeper psychological tethering.“I came to see the relationship between Parker and Elvis as a kind of shared tragedy,” he says. “Each had their own addictions. [Parker] was somebody who was so vulnerable, not just at the time but vulnerable from his childhood in ways we simply will never know, suffering from some form of trauma, being somebody who really couldn’t stand to be touched by somebody that he didn’t know.”He was “an introvert who had to learn to act like an extrovert in order to survive”, according to Loanne, his second wife.Parker died in 1997 and took some of his secrets with him to the grave, but Guralnick’s book offers the most rounded, complex and myth-dispelling understanding of him we are ever likely to get.The Colonel and the King by Peter Guralnick (White Rabbit, £35).

The setting is Corsica, around the 1990s, in the coastal region of Ajaccio, famously the home of Napoleon. Lesia (played by nonprofessional Ghjuvanna Benedetti) is a moody 15-year-old girl living with her aunt, hanging out with her friends and boisterous extended family of cousins.School is out for the summer and Lesia appears to be getting into a romance with a local boy. Maybe because of this, or due to other reasons, she is ordered to leave her aunt’s house and go to the luxurious and fortified family compound of her widowed father. This is mob boss Pierre-Paul (superbly played by Saveriu Santucci), a heavy-set, slow-moving but intimidating patriarch who is perhaps displeased with her behaviour, but also gruffly tender and indulgent.Lesia soon senses that her dad and his consiglieri are discussing a recent attempted hit on his life, and the need for payback. At first, Lesia had been pining to go back home to her aunt, but soon she is thrilled to be an intimate witness, daughter and lieutenant to her father. Perhaps like Mary Corleone or Meadow Soprano, Lesia has an intense awareness of her own blueblood status and her father’s importance in the world, as well as his importance to her personally. She has, of course, long forgotten about her crush on that callow boy: her father is the real man in her life.The performances of Benedetti and Santucci in the long and intimate dialogue scenes that Colonna gives them are really outstanding, as Pierre-Paul sadly explains the endless cycle of revenge that is now his life, and which began when he had to avenge his father’s death more than three decades previously: “A young man’s anger … all human history is based on it.” We know what’s coming, of course, but the film shows that something in its very inevitability is shocking. An intensely atmospheric, absorbing and exciting drama.The Kingdom is in UK and Irish cinemas from 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsMafiaFranceEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

Rosamund Pike’s star turn as a crown court judge, at the National Theatre in London, has proved that there’s just one prop you need to turn even the most serious of subjects into a punk performance – a microphone. AndInter Aliais only the latest in a number of major openings to star the humble handheld: from Greek tragedy to Chekhov, the device seems to be increasingly common in West End productions.Microphones were integral toThomas Ostermeier’s meta-theatrical production of The Seagull at the Barbican, and Jamie Lloyd – having used handhelds to transformJames McAvoy into a rapping Cyrano de Bergeracthree years ago – has deployed them in both Shakespeare (Much Ado) and Lloyd Webber (Evita). And no production used them more controversially thanDaniel Fish’s Elektra, whose lead, Brie Larson, spoke her entire part into an on-stage amp, distorting her own voice with a range of effects pedals.The only power she has, the only chance of justice, is through the noise she makesMicrophones have been a source of contention in the theatre ever sinceTrevor Nunn introduced radio mics to the National in 1999. But a handheld isn’t something a director is trying to hide, unlike the miniature, hands-free microphones that audiences are now used to seeing actors wear. “Personally I think those things that sit on the top of people’s foreheads, like a bug, look silly,” says Fish. “But here the microphone becomes an instrument, right? It’s something that the actor can play with so it becomes a very dynamic thing.”While it might not have been in use in Sophocles’ time, Fish found it a fascinating proposition in the rehearsal room. “Elektra is about a woman who refuses to be quiet, so the idea of amplifying and centring her voice felt important,” he says. “This is a person for whom the only power that she has, the only chance of justice, is through the noise she makes.”View image in fullscreenHelped with the story … Cate Blanchett as Arkadina in The Seagull.Photograph: Marc BrennerOne of the memorable elements of Larson’s sonic performance was the way she sang, rather than spoke, the word “no” – highlighting just how many times it appears in the play, although the punk sensibility did divide the critics. Or, as Fish puts it, “the show pissed a lot of people off”.Ostermeier enjoys the “attitude” that handheld mics can bring to a performance (put one in a rehearsal room, and every actor wants to be the one holding it). “Of course, it’s about who has the power to talk and who is excluded, about status and power,” says the German director, “but it’s also about pop culture.” Ostermeier enjoys placing theatre within the context of the entertainment industry it belongs to: his Seagull kicked off with an actor performing some Billy Bragg, then asking the audience if they were ready for “a little bit of Chekhov”.In that deliberately meta production, on-stage microphones were employed throughout to help indicate when characters were speaking to each other or “performing” for a wider audience.Cate Blanchettfound it transformative for the part of Irina Arkadina, a famous actor and hopeless showoff: “They helped the story we wanted to tell,” says Ostermeier, “which is that Arkadina is completely lost in it. She doesn’t have a real relationship with other human beings any more without some form of media in between.”There is nothing new about handheld mics on stage, as all these directors are keen to point out: pioneers from the Wooster Group to Pina Bausch to Marina Abramović were using them in the 1970s. “It’s a technique that’s been around for a long time,” says Katie Mitchell, whose wordless, sonically driven workCow | Deerarrives at the Royal Court in September. “I’ve always been interested in how you can amplify the spoken voice without having to distort your body or your voice to make it sound louder,” says Mitchell, who has been working with microphones for decades now (in her own version of The Seagull in 2006, Hattie Morahan’s Nina whispered her lines into one).A healthy society should have a wide spectrum of performance modesIt’s a paradox of the microphone that while it presents as performative and even political, it can also bring us closer to the character’s subjective experience. “We’re being invited into a more intimate relationship – we can hear their saliva, their breathing,” says Mitchell. That requires technicians as sensitive and responsive as the performers themselves, such as Laura Hammond, the sound engineer who live-mixed the scenes in Elektra. “A lot of times everything just goes into the computer, everything is set,” says Fish, “and that makes me want to pull my hair out.”For some theatre lovers, the current vogue for on-stage amplification is less welcome. One veteran actor in Ostermeier’s own company, who like so many stage actors has trained his voice to fill large spaces, refuses to use microphones. “He’s annoyed because it’s a theatrical fashion,” says the director, “and he doesn’t want to be part of this fashion any more.”Mitchell acknowledges the challenge microphones represent to the proud tradition of voice work in theatre: “There’s a sense if you’re not allowing actors to use all their skill for vocal projection and you’re just mediating it with technology, this undermines that tradition.But I’m always of the position that a healthy society should have a wide spectrum of performance modes.”As ever, there’s a danger that a popular technique becomes a fad, used without a sense or purpose. “It moves from innovation to convention to cliche awfully quickly,” admits Fish. But right now, Mitchell believes the age of the microphone is something to be enjoyed. “All these practitioners have got good political or intellectual underpinnings – let’s celebrate it, and not police each other. Let’s just chill.”Explore more on these topicsStageTheatreRosamund PikeThomas OstermeierTrevor NunnBrie LarsonCate BlanchettfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We spoke to four families about why they enjoy watching bands together.‘It felt like a multi-generational event’Mark Taubert, his seven-year-old son and his 12-year-old daughter were one of many families in attendance at Stevie Wonder’s Cardiff concert in Blackweir Fields, Cardiff, in July. “He came on to the stage and lit the place up with his charisma and magnetism. I was surprised to see quite a few different age groups in the crowd. ThenStevie Wonderbrought two of his own children on stage, and it felt even more like a multigenerational event,” he says.“My son Idris even had a brief restorative snooze during Living for the City, but then woke up for Sir Duke – one of his favourites.”Even if Idris didn’t fully appreciate the whole show, Mark hopes his son will in future. “In 80 years’ time, Stevie Wonder will just be this sort of legendary figure of the past, and my son will be able to say that he saw him.”It was quite the contrast to the gigs of his youth, Mark says. “My worst was Guns N’ Roses in Mannheim when I was 16. There was a riot at that show. It wasn’t necessarily something I’d take my kids to.”‘We combined Jesus and Mary Chain with a trip to the skatepark’View image in fullscreenJames Cooper and his daughter Astrid.Photograph: Guardian CommunityBefore the Oasis reunion tourcommenced in July, The Jesus and Mary Chain played Tramshed in Cardiff in June. The gig was a bonding experience for James Cooper and his daughter Astrid.“As a fan of theJesus and Mary Chainsince I was 15, I was delighted that my daughter Astrid declared that they were her favourite band too,” he says. “I recalled to Astrid that JAMC were the precursors to Oasis – being warring brothers on the same label and paving the way for Oasis in many ways – but loads better! We are both skateboarders, so we combined the day with a trip to the skatepark. I considered ourselves very lucky that we got to see the far superior band in a small venue.“My daughter loved the day and the experience. She didn’t get emotional like I did, though. It was maybe more significant for me, as she is almost same age as I was when I first saw them at 15. These experiences with one’s daughter don’t happen very often.”‘It’s the best concert I had seen since Sting in 1990s’View image in fullscreenAlice Witter and her son at a Billie Eilish concert.Photograph: Guardian CommunityAlice Witter and her 18-year-old son travelled 200 miles to seeBillie Eilishplay Co-Op Live in Manchester last month. “We both like her albums equally.

It’s really nice to see.”Her family’s first gig was Dizzee Rascal at Sziget festival in Budapest in 2013, when her sons were 11 and 13. “It was such a great feeling to be dancing and singing along to all our favourite songs, although there was a lot of swearing. A young Hungarian couple even came up to me at the end to say they thought I was cool.”More recently, Jo, her sons, now 23 and 25, and her husband have seen Nick Cave at the O2 in London andAsian Dub Foundationin Lille. “My husband and I are big fans of Nick Cave, so the kids grew up listening to him at home. I get quite emotional when they play songs that we all used to sing together in the car or in the kitchen. We like to think we’ve given them an eclectic taste in music.

Fever-dreamed by Canadian clowning duo Creepy Boys, this absurd existential rave is brilliantly smart and beautifully stupid.Wriggling on to the stage in sleeping bags with puffy vulval gaps for their faces and arms, Sam Kruger and SE Grummett insist, with increasing desperation, that this is a show about nothing. No serious topic will be tackled here. Not gun violence, not climate change, not gender identity. Creepy Boys want to take those heavy, stressful “somethings” and stomp on them while we dance to techno and watch a soothing puppet show instead. When the eggshell-ridden world outside is so hard to navigate, don’t we deserve some smooth-brained blankness? Like slugs: the ultimate nothing.View image in fullscreen‘Mostly gross’ … Sam Kruger and SE Grummett in Slugs.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianBut sticking to this nothingness proves difficult. Whenever the pair stray into a topic that threatens to be “a something” they retreat, flailing into a cesspit of panic that they’ve ruined the show. Stripped down to bright, tight plastic bibs and free-wheeling genitals, they frantically cover their close-calls with sweaty, delirious misdirections of our attention: Joni Mitchell puppetry; live animations; a two-headed horse. As it becomes harder to stay in the safe zone, every word, body part and casually shoved-in-your-face gun becomes riddled with unavoidably political connotations.The pair admit their work is “a little bit niche and mostly gross” but this howl of a show uses an anarchic, DIY aesthetic to cloak innovative design and complex Derridian concepts. What begins as an effort to distract from the doom-scroll mentality devolves into a critical analysis of the absurdities we accept as the norm. In a world so unruly, theirs seems the only sane response.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)ClownsSummerhallTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Set amid a family reunion dinner in Northern Ireland, only the women are present here. And in the way of many such theatrical reunions, it leads to an almighty blow-up, yet there is no hint of cliche. Kelly is a talented playwright navigating between black humour and pain.At the head of the table is Eileen (Julia Dearden), a foul-mouthed matriarch whose 90thbirthday they are celebrating. Gilly (Andrea Irvine) is her daughter and the mother of Jenny (Caoimhe Farren), who left long ago for a life in London. Muireann (Muireann Ní Fhaogáin), the youngest, is Jenny’s London-born-and-raised daughter.Slickly directed by Katie Posner, it is horribly, humorously, gripping: reminiscent ofBeth Steel’s Till the Stars Come Downat its best, with flecks of Martin McDonagh’s mother-daughter drama The Beauty Queen of Leenane. Daughters cyclically blame their mothers for the pain and harm they’ve inherited, while letting their fathers off the hook.View image in fullscreenGhosts at the table … (from left) Muireann Ní Fhaogáin, Andrea Irvine, Julia Dearden and Caoimhe Farren in Consumed.Photograph: Pamela RaithEileen appears, at first, like a cartoonishly drawn battleaxe, but she is perhaps best at hiding vulnerability. Gilly has comical spurts of rage despite her cultivated, singalong calmness. Jenny is full of blame towards her, pointing out maternal shortcomings like a stroppy teen, and is superbly played by Farren. Muireann is the flattest character, satirised for her gen Z talk of gluten and environmental harm. She has an eating disorder but it is too briefly broached and appears to fit the greater scheme of a play in which each woman is grappling with suppressed trauma, passed down and ingested as their own.The play travels from dining table realism to the baroque. The rumbles in Beth Duke’s sound design foreshadow this turn into lyrical and symbolic new ground. Talk of Northern Ireland’s past peppered the early scenes but it now becomes clear that this cross-generational family represents a bigger history of violence. The play’s shape-shifting is part of its audaciousness, but this late turn is brief and leaves much hanging.It is a lot to grapple with in 70 minutes and you feel as if Consumed could be developed into a bigger play at a longer length, or streamlined for this shorter one. Either way, its potential is clear.At theTraverse theatre, Edinburgh, until 24 August.

Because the boys are Palestinian, and the horse is stationed at a roundabout in Jenin in the West Bank, this is not only a coming-of-age drama but also a look at the brutality of the Israeli occupation, endured by Palestinian civilians over many decades.In this case, the civilians are best friends growing up amid the rubble of repeated invasions, learning to play alongside it. The story begins long before 7 October 2023, although it finishes here, when the model horse is ripped down and destroyed by an Israeli tank.In tone, it is bouncy, droll and warm. Underneath it buzzes with suppressed suffering and fear, but also resilience. Writer and comedian Alaa Shehada begins in standup mode, cracking jokes, engaging the audience: “My name is Alaa, not Allah.”It is clear this will not be a sombre lesson on the Middle East conflict. Shehada now lives in Amsterdam but takes us back to a rambunctious childhood in Jenin, moving through the decades in picaresque strides, from his inseparable friendship with Ahmed, who is born on the same day as him, to school days, a disastrous romance, and the grandfather who gives him a small model horse. It is, he tells us, a symbol of freedom and, years later, a German artist comes to the West Bank to build a five-metre horse out of the rubble of the 2002 Israeli invasion, after the second intifada.View image in fullscreenExuberant … Alaa Shehada in The Horse of Jenin.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianIn the foreground are Shehada’s exuberant tales of the 1990s and 00s. In the backdrop hover soldiers with automatic firearms at checkpoints, tanks flattening homes, rockets firing at ambulances, killing celebrated doctors. The parallels from then to now are appalling in their never-ending violent circularity.Artfully directed by Katrien van Beurden and Thomas van Ouwerkerk, the production is one of a number of Palestinian stories at this year’s fringe includingMy Name Is Rachel Corrie,NowhereandBalfour Reparations. Shehada is very funny and full of energy, mixing English with Arabic, using commedia dell’arte masks and mime in funny and haunting ways, taking wry snipes at western media searches for tragic stories in the region. It builds to a gut-punch, although there is no self-pity or sentimentality. This is a production that chooses to find joy amid horror.Alaa’s friendship with Ahmed, in its innocence and loss, is deeply moving.And how can anyone fail to feel the resonance of this amid reports – rejected by the IDF – that the Israeli army is shooting at children?All that is left, in such abject circumstances, is storytelling – and Shehada knows it power.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburghuntil 25 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatreComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

More than 60 years after her death, the blond mop, the wafting white dress and that wiggle of a walk continue to inspire imitators.EastEnders actor Michelle Collins, making her fringe debut, once came across such an acolyte in LA and was fascinated. The woman, in her 60s, pulled up in a motorhome and emerged looking just like the star ofSome Like It Hot. What need for fame, what thirst for attention, what emotional hunger could drive such a person?The encounter stayed with her and, with playwright Ben Weatherill picking up where her late friendStewart Permuttleft off, she now plays Denise, a girl from Southend who has wound up in the US as a 61-year-old Monroe lookalike, hustling for loose change as a street entertainer by a convenient air vent.In front of an adoring audience, Collins plays Denise with a mixture of the hard-bitten and the gullible. Under the direction of Alexandra Spencer-Jones, she also does a suitably breathy and sweet-voiced rendition of River of No Return, suggesting that with the right breaks, this copycat performer could have done all right for herself.View image in fullscreenFandom … Collins in Motorhome Marilyn.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianFor no obvious reason, Denise has chosen to tell her life story to her pet snake. And what a dismal tale it is. The script is a litany of letdowns, exploitation, unwanted pregnancy, dead-end gigs, spiced up with one unlikely melodramatic twist. It aspires to be tragic but comes across as plain miserable.It would be one thing if these were the backstage anecdotes of a real actor, quite another for them to be fictional. Why spend time with such a lost and deluded person? My performance was interrupted moments before the fiery denouement by someone falling ill, but it would take more than a dramatic ending to elevate such a dreary play.At theGilded Balloon, Edinburgh, until 25 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedyMarilyn MonroeEdinburgh festivalFestivalsEastEndersreviewsShareReuse this content"

His teams employ “drone cowhands, whose quadcopters have thermal cameras that can reveal any wolf lurking in the darkness”. The predator is then spotlit and treated to audio blasted over a loudspeaker. Aside from Baumbach-scripted acid insults, tracks include fireworks, gunshots and AC/DC’s Thunderstruck.The practice is know as “wolf hazing” and is employed rather than culling as grey wolves are on the federal government’s list of endangered species.Happily, Driver and Johansson’s Academy Award-nominated performances have proved just as impactful for canines as humans.“Drones were deployed in the Klamath Basin of southern Oregon after 11 cows were killed by wolves there in a 20-day period,” reports the WSJ. “Over the next 85 days, when drones were on patrol, only two were killed.”Other emotionally volatile high-points in the 2019 film include Driver’s feeling rendition of Steven Sondheim’s Being Alive and Dern’scaustic broadsideabout the double standards by which mothers and fathers are judged (which found an echo in America Ferrera’s speech in the 2023 film Barbie, which was also co-written by Baumbach). It is not believed either of these moments are also being broadcast to pests.Marriage Story premiered at the Venice film festival in 2019 and was named on many critics’ best of the year lists, comingsecondon the Guardian’s year-end roundup.In his five starreviewof the film, Peter Bradshaw singled out the “central rage-filled confrontation” for praise. “This does feel theatrical,” he wrote, “but in such a lucid and intelligent way.”Explore more on these topicsMarriage StoryScarlett JohanssonAdam DriverAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that 40 signatories signed with their names while the others signed anonymously because of fear of reprisals.The members said they were deeply concerned about “recent actions and decisions taken by the RBO in the context of the ongoing genocide in Gaza”.In particular, the signatories highlighted the RBO’s recent hiring out of its production of Turandot to the Israeli Opera. “The decision cannot be viewed as neutral,” they said. “It is a deliberate alignment, materially and symbolically, with a government currently engaged in crimes against humanity.“The venue itself, the IsraeliOpera, publicly offers free tickets to soldiers of the Israeli Defense Forces ‘in recognition of their work’, as stated on their website. The RBO is clearly making a strong political statement by allowing its production and intellectual property to be presented in a space that openly rewards and legitimises the very forces responsible for the daily killings of civilians in Gaza.”They said they rejected “any current or future performances in Israel” and demanded the organisation “withholds our productions from institutions that legitimise and economically support a state engaged in the mass killing of civilians”.Production hires mean sets, props and costumes are rented out to another opera house. Preparations for Turandot were taking place when theIsrael-Iran war broke out, and rehearsals were held in bomb shelters. The Guardian understands at least one performer decided to leave the production and sought therapy because of this.The signatories also expressed solidarity with Daniel Perry, the performer who raised the Palestinian flag in “an act of courage and moral clarity on our very stage” on 19 July.They condemned what they called “extremely poor judgment” by RBO’s director of opera, Oliver Mears, who “we witnessed attempting to forcibly snatch the flag from the performer, displaying visible anger and aggression in front of the entire audience”.Perry later said Mears told him he would“never work for the Opera House ever again”.The signatories called for Mears “to be held accountable for his public display of aggression” and said the act, “far from being a neutral administrative intervention, was itself a loud political statement. It sent a clear message that any visible solidarity with Palestine would be met with hostility.”The letter highlighted the role the arts had historically played during times of crisis, and cited the RBO’s swiftness to stand in solidarity with Ukraine after Russia’s invasion.It said: “We organised Concerts for Ukraine, we played the Ukrainian national anthem before performances, and we publicly displayed the Ukrainian flag as a gesture of solidarity with its people. We understood then that silence was unacceptable. Why is it different now? … The double standard is deafening.”Organisers of the letter said years spent working to change public perceptions of the RBO to make it more inclusive and accessible were “threatened by recent choices”.The RBO confirmed to the Guardian thatToscawould not go to the Israeli Opera. Beard said: “I am appalled by the crisis in Gaza and recognise the deep emotional impact this has had across our community and wider society. On this issue, we acknowledge and respect the full range of views held by our staff, artists and audiences.“The events at the curtain call on 19 July were without precedent. We have reflected carefully and reviewed our internal protocols. We always endeavour to act with integrity and compassion. We want our stage to remain a space for shared cultural appreciation, free from individual political statements.“Our support for Ukraine was aligned with the global consensus at the time. As the world’s geopolitics have become more complex, our stance has changed to ensure that our actions reflect our purpose and values.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesRoyal BalletRoyal Opera HousenewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianEastern Ukraine’s biggest city is unsettlingly close to the Russian border and vulnerable to missile strikes, but there is a determination to maintain a cultural life, and a poetry festival is testament to the resilience and creativity of its peopleByCharlotte Higginsin Kharkiv; photographs byJulia KochetovaMon 4 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 4 Aug 2025 05.27 EDTShareThe city of Kharkiv, just 18 miles from the Russian border, is a paradoxical mix of tended-to and broken. Public sculptures are wrapped and coddled in sandbags to protect them from missiles. Flowerbeds in parks are punctiliously maintained. The life of the streets is several notches quieter than you would expect from a European country’s second city – and yet, bookshops, coffee shops and restaurants are open and doing a steady business.But the signs of Russia’s unrelenting attacks on this frontline city are omnipresent. On the roads are rows of rusted lines of the spiky metal tank obstacles known as “hedgehogs”. The magnificent 1920s Derzhprom building, a constructivist masterpiece and the architectural pride of the city, is nowbadly battered.Across the city, windows, blown out from buildings by nightly explosions, have been replaced by sheets of chipboard. One panel in the city centre has been pasted over with a paper cutout of two enfolding arms and the words, “I love you, beloved Kharkiv.”Two images side by side: left is Serhii Zhadan, a Ukrainian poet and writer; right is a view over Kharkiv, very dark clouds in the foreground, lighter sky in the distanceSerhii Zhadan, a Ukrainian poet and writer who is now serving in the Khartiia brigade. Right, the view over the city from Karazin Kharkiv National UniversityCultural life clings on. But it has largely burrowed below ground: the basements of theatres are now theirmain stages; bookshops’event venuesare subterranean. One Kharkiv visual artist,Kostiantyn Zorkin, has created an apt metaphor for the atmosphere of this underground world. A series of his works imagines wartime Kharkiv as a ship alone in stormy seas, its inhabitants huddled, in relative safety, in the vessel’s hold.The city’s population now consists of those who have moved here from places even more dangerous; and those who have stayed in their own city either because they must, or from a refusal to let Kharkiv’s urban life die.Such resolve to stay involves a having made a personal accommodation with the proximity of death. Air defences in Kharkiv are few, and Russia is near. By the time the air-raid alarm sounds, often the missiles are already falling.Two images side by side: left, a man sitting  with an open book on his knees, shot from the neck down; right, some windows of the Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city centre protected with chipboard.Serhii Zhadan reads from Yuliia Paievska’s debut book of poetry at the Meridian Kharkiv festival. Her call-sign is ‘Taira’ and she also serves in the Khartiia brigade. Right, boarded up windows in the Derzhprom building in Kharkiv city centreUnder these circumstances, something as intimate and emotionally charged as a poetry festival – such as the recent two-day event in a below-ground venue in the city centre – takes on a significance and intensity unimaginable in peacetime.When Kharkiv’s most celebrated poet, novelist and musician Serhii Zhadan performs his own poems, some rapt audience members mouth along, clearly knowing the verses by heart.“There are more than a million people in Kharkiv,” says Zhadan, now serving with the local Khartiia brigade, between readings. “They have cultural needs. The festival is important from a psychological point of view: they see that they are not alone, that they have not been abandoned, that there are many people around them who share their values, are on the same wavelength.”View image in fullscreenPoet Yuliia Paievska on stage at the festivalThe festival, organised by publisher Meridian Czernowitz, is the first of its kind in Kharkiv, though the publishing house has conducted events in southern frontline cities such as Odesa, Mykolaiv and Kherson since 2023.“People from frontline cities can go to a shelter and feel safe and listen to poetry – and while they are doing that, they are not sitting at home listening to drones or reading Facebook,” says organiser Evgenia Lopata.People are searching for Ukrainian identity … and people want Ukrainian literature to readEvgenia Lopata“Being here means being part of a community that is supporting each other,” she says. It is partly a case of people connecting to fellow Ukrainian speakers in a city that for years has been mainly Russophone, Lopata adds. Though many inhabitants, particularly in the city’s creative community, have shifted to Ukrainian since Russia launched its invasion in 2022.“People are searching for Ukrainian identity, a lot of people took a big decision to change language to Ukrainian, and people want Ukrainian literature to read,” says Lopata.“We print all our books in Kharkiv,” she adds, “and we can produce our books only because the people employed at the printworks are still working. The least we can do is come here and do readings.” The sizeable printing industry in Kharkiv is precarious, however: in May last year, several S300 bombsbadly damaged the city’s Factor Druk printworksandkilled seven people.The first poet to read at the Kharkiv poetry festival is Yuliia Paievska, a celebrated combat medic with the nom de guerre “Taira”.Two images side by side: left, Yuliia Paievska seated on stage reads from her debut book of poetry at the Meridian Kharkiv festival; right, deserted streets in Kharkiv city centreYuliia Paievska, call-sign Taira, prepares to read from her debut book of poetry at the festival. Right, deserted streets in Kharkiv city centreShe was captured in March 2022 while treating a civilian in Mariupol, and held in captivity in Russia for several months. She endured appalling conditions and torture until her release in June 2022.Paievska started writing poems in captivity, she says, by taking a tiny piece of plaster and scratching words into the cell wall – a forbidden act. “It pulled me out of the abyss,” she says. Afterwards, she could not remember those fragments with any clarity, only the feelings that had created them. But after her release she began writing poems in earnest.“It was a way of remaining human, of preserving your mind,” she says of those wall-scratchings after her reading. “I wrote in order to remember who I was … Everything in the Russian penitentiary system is aimed at making you sure that you cannot control anything.” All she could control, she says, were “my breathing and poem-making”.Two images side by side: left, Ukrainian poet and film-maker Iryna Tsilyk, wearing a dark blue dress; and the statue of Mykola Gogol in Kharkiv, wrapped up for protection.Poet and film-maker Iryna Tsilyk, and, right, the monument to Mykola Gogol in Kharkiv, wrapped up to protect it from Russian missilesIt is life as a civilian that celebrated film-maker and poet Iryna Tsilyk describes as she takes to the stage, reading, among other poems,My Day, an account of the way that contradictory experiences – sheltering from an air attack, making breakfast for a child, weeping in the shower, choosing wine in the supermarket – are uncomfortably compressed together in wartime Kyiv.She speaks too of a mounting preoccupation in Ukraine: how those from different parts of society, coping with widely differing experiences of war and trauma, are divided by mutual incomprehension.She tells the audience of her own experience, when her husband, novelist Artem Chekh, returned home from the frontline in 2016 (he is now serving in Kyiv, after a stint in the battle for Bakhmut in 2023).“It was a date you’ve been waiting for for six months, and a stranger arrives with sunken shoulders and a glassy stare, because he had spent 10 months in the trenches,” she tells the audience.“You have no idea how you can be together, how to talk, and how to rebuild a shared space of intimacy. I think that many couples are experiencing this and some, unfortunately, do not survive.”audience members at the Meridian Kharkiv festival; Kharkiv city centreAudience members at the Meridian Kharkiv festival; right, anti-tank ‘hedgehogs’ on the streets in Kharkiv city centreMany audience members – most of them in their 20s and 30s – stay for the entire programme of conversations and readings that lasts from lunchtime through to 8.30pm. One of the audience, IT worker Olena Dolya, has a fatalistic approach to remaining in the city: “My windows and balcony are intact,” she says. “And I’m more comfortable at home than anywhere else.”She takes regular trips to Kyiv to experience a fuller cultural life: “I need it and I miss it.” She is reading now more than she has since childhood – “it’s one of my ways of staying sane, and it calms me”, she says.It’s very important to have culture during war. It shows you are humanArsenii Vasyliev“It’s very important to have culture during war,” says copywriter Arsenii Vasyliev, also in the audience. “It shows you are human.” According to his girlfriend, ex-librarian Sofia Kyshkovarova, “The festival is a sign that Kharkiv is alive.”According to Zhadan: “War is a state of maximum abnormality, maximum disintegration. It seems to me that culture, above all else, is capable of somehow conveying these things, of somehow articulating them.“In 50 or 100 years, if humanity survives, if books survive, then we will learn about this war primarily through literature.”Explore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayUkraineHeritageEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Words spill out of Pepys – 1.25m of them – as he bustles around London, building a successful career as a naval administrator while navigating the double trauma of the plague and the Great Fire of London. Historians have long gone to the diary for details of middle-class life during the mid‑17th century: the seamy streets, the watermen, the taverns and, as Pepys moves up the greasy pole, the court and the king. Best of all is his eye for the picturesque detail: the way, for instance, on the morning of 4 September 1666, as fire licks around his house, Pepys buries a choice parmesan cheese in the garden with the intention of keeping it safe.Not all of the diary is in English, though. Quite a lot of it is in French (or rather Franglais), Latin, Spanish and a curious mashup of all three. Pepys increasingly resorted to this home-brewed polyglot whenever the subject of sex came up, which was often. Indeed, sex – chasing it, having it, worrying about getting it again – dominated Pepys’s waking life and haunted his dreams, many of them nightmares. Putting these anguished passages in a garbled form not only lessened the chance of servants snooping, but also served to protect him from his own abiding sense of shame. As an extra layer of concealment, Pepys wrote “my Journall” using tachygraphy, an early form of shorthand.Pepys’s diaries were published in bowdlerised form in the 19th century, and it was not until the 1970s that they became available in 11 unexpurgated volumes. Even then, explains Guy de la Bédoyère, there were many transcription errors and, crucially, no attempt was made to translate the coded passages into English. Historians knew about them, of course, not least because all you needed was a bit of classroom French and Latin to work out their meaning. On 25 March 1668, Pepys records that he has given “Mrs Daniels” eight pairs of gloves “for tocar my prick con her hand”, which is hardly likely to keep anyone guessing for very long.While Pepys’s dark side has long been known, it is something else to be confronted with the evidence laid out quite so starklyAll the same, it has been easy to lose sight of the sexual thread of Pepys’s diary amid all the chatter about navy ships and expensive cheese. Which is why, for the first time, De la Bédoyère has gone back to the original manuscript and translated all of Pepys’s coded entries, publishing them end-to-end with only a minimum of contextual information. The result is an extraordinarily detailed snapshot of life seen through the eyes of a man for whom no day was complete unless he had managed to fondle at least one woman’s “mameles” (breasts) on his way to or from work.In the past, people have blamed Pepys’s bad behaviour on the Restoration. These were the years when the dour pieties of Oliver Cromwell had been replaced by Charles II’s permissive libertarianism. But there is much more – and much worse – to the occluded parts of Pepys’s diary than mere bawdiness. On 3 February 1664, for example, he is travelling in a carriage down Ludgate Hill when he witnesses three men raping a woman and wishes he could join in. On 1 December 1660, he beats his maid Jane savagely with a broom, though it is clear that he is eyeing her up for a future assignation. He often uses the words “towsing” and “tumbling” to describe what he is doing with women which sounds jolly and bucolic until De la Bédoyère explains that these terms are euphemisms for violence.The only occasion on which Pepys might hold back was if he knew a woman was single, which would make any pregnancy impossible to explain away. (It was a mercy that he didn’t realise that an earlier operation for a bladder stone had probably left him sterile.) For that reason, he badgered any girl he wanted to sleep with regularly to get married, so he could carry on regardless. As news of his behaviour got around, so others would try to exploit it. On 11 August 1665, an old waterman called Delkes presented Pepys with his daughter-in-law, who was willing to sleep with him in return for a guarantee that her husband would not be pressed into naval service.And then there was his marriage. Pepys had wed Elizabeth when she was just 14. He was proud of her beauty, congratulating himself on how much prettier she was than the many grand ladies at court whom he encountered on his way to becoming secretary to the navy. Everything else about her frustrated him. He grumbled about her untidiness, extravagance, moodiness and the fact that her heavy periods and a recurrent labial abscess meant that she often wasn’t available for sex. Most of all, he resented the way that she had taken to hiring plain maidservants in the hope that he would leave them alone (it didn’t work). Inevitably he took out his frustrations with his fists: on 19 December 1664 he gave Elizabeth such a black eye that she was unable to go to church on Christmas Day for fear of what the neighbours would think.While Pepys’s dark side has long been known, it is something else to be confronted with the evidence laid out quite so starkly. The man who emerges from De la Bédoyère’s meticulous filleting is no Restoration roustabout but a chilling embodiment of male entitlement. This newly explicit view of Pepys does not negate the continuing value of his diary – which remains a magnificent historical resource – but from now on it will be impossible to go to it in a state of innocence, let alone denial.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

It gives us a promising flavour of the voice with whom we’ll be spending the next 340 pages.The story begins with deceptive simplicity: “Once upon a time, I had seven dads in seven years. This is the story of those years.” The narrative has a section for each “dad”, charting Andrev’s tumultuous childhood and teens as his mother’s boyfriends come and go, all of them disappointing and disruptive, and several of them violent. The dads are named for their dominant trait in young Andrev’s eyes: so we get the Plant Magician, the Thief, the Murderer, the Artist, among others.It is billed as a novel but we’re in ambiguous territory here. The story is heavily autobiographical, based on Walden’s own childhood experiences. The narrator tells us: “If anything sounds made up, then you can be sure that it is true.” Instead, the inventions are “tucked away in the most mundane parts – like the colour of a cushion”. So we have two Andrevs involved, the child whose bewildered, coming-of-age adventures we follow, and the “real” Andrev, whose name is on the front cover. Metafictional interjections pepper the narrative, the authorial voice frequently intruding to comment on its own decisions, such as Andrev’s observation on the very first page: “I shouldn’t start there. (I have most assuredly already done so, but I think the attempt should remain, given its aptness as a bridge to a dramaturgical arc.)” These postmodern flourishes could have felt grating, but the narrative voice has more than enough wit and charm to carry them off.Walden’s instinct for observation and his ear for prose are flawless – his understated humour is particularly winningIt’s easy to see why the book has been such a hit in Walden’s native Sweden, where it was the bestseller of 2023 across all genres and won the August prize, Sweden’s most prestigious literary award. Walden’s instinct for observation and his ear for prose are flawless. His understated humour is particularly winning. Going to stay with relatives, Andrev is amazed by the number of cousins in the house: “There are so many rooms and so many cousins that I keep finding new ones. It’s like opening doors on an Advent calendar – wow, here’s another cousin.” And then, a few pages later: “When we return to the apartment on Tomtebogatan, new cousins have emerged from the walls.” (He hasn’t yet realised that his aunt is a childminder.)But for all its humour, there is a terrible bleakness at the novel’s core. The men are, almost without exception, selfish, violent, dishonest or cruel; sometimes all of these at once. It is characteristic of Walden’s restraint that one of the most chilling moments in the novel is barely more than an aside, a reference to the friend of Andrev’s mother, Little Cloud, whose ex-boyfriend turned up at her door one night: “He didn’t want to talk. He didn’t even want to come in. All he wanted was to hit her on the head with the hammer and that he did, wordlessly. That’s how she got the hole in her head and learned to hate men.” The childish offhandness with which this moment is treated makes it all the more disturbing.Of all the dads, the brilliantly drawn Plant Magician looms largest in the narrative. Some of the others have a tendency to blur into one another (the book might also have been called Bloody Awful in Pretty Similar Ways). But it’s not really about the dads anyway. It’s about Andrev, and, to a lesser extent, his vulnerable and resilient mother.Beyond the structural device of the seven dads, Walden resists any easy narrative hooks; Andrev warns us not to “harbour expectations of an unexpected twist – this story lacks such inclinations”. Instead, Walden trusts to the precision and flair of his writing alone, and for the most part this decision is vindicated. It is true that the momentum dissipates somewhat in the final third (I could probably have done with one or two fewer dads, but since we’re in the realm of semifictionalised memoir, this is a bit much to ask). However, the writing remains so sharp, so beguiling, so acutely observed that by this point I was willing to follow Andrev/Andrev pretty much anywhere.Rebecca Wait’sHavocis published by Riverrun.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It is a movie about the eternal presence of the dead, which, along with the murmuringly restrained dialogue, makes it comparable to the work of Thai directorApichatpong Weerasethakul.The film’s two key characters unselfconsciously bear names that symbolise the nation. It is 2001, and Viet (Duy Bao Dinh Dao) and Nam (Thanh Hai Pham) are two twentysomething men who were babies when theVietnam warwas concluded. They are coal miners and are in love, often having sex actually down in the mine. These sequences are as bizarre as they are erotic, yet conceivably supposed to be understood on the level of a vision or dream, because the dark coal on which they recline looks like a starlit sky. This could be because the mine is a kind of secular underworld but also because there is surely something uncomfortable and unlikely about sex in these circumstances, as their relationship does perhaps have to kept secret above ground. There is, though, a moment of rare comedy in a line bifurcated with a pause, when they are asked: “When will you two get married … when will you get wives?”Nam is planning to leave Vietnam in a desperately dangerous container unit. But first he has to solve the inexpressibly painful question of where his late father’s remains are – he was killed in action during the war and his body never found. Nam’s mother Hoa (Thi Nga Nguyen), who has a shop selling coal briquettes, is having vivid dreams which she thinks will lead her to the spot, and his father’s old friend and disabled military comrade Ba (Le Viet Tung) has volunteered to join the search, perhaps with memories that he has not yet told anyone about. Their expedition takes them into the forested wilderness, to a whitefaced psychic who is apparently making a living helping people like Hoa, and then also tothe Ba Chuc Memorial to the 1978 massacre by the Khmer Rouge, with its horrendous display of skulls.The terrible sadness of the film is to be found in a rather extraordinary late scene in which Ba reveals something awful to Hoa, who then immediately has to deal with a customer, an interruption to be compared with the one at the end of Brief Encounter. Viet and Nam is a film that first feels opaque and elusive, and yet it becomes drenched with emotion.Viet and Nam is at the ICA, London, from 8 August and is available to stream on SBS On Demand in Australia.Explore more on these topicsWorld cinemaDrama filmsVietnamRomance filmsAsia PacificVietnam warreviewsShareReuse this content"

Originally fromDenmark, he spent his childhood in Norway with his parents and two brothers, Frederick and Kristoffer. The relocation was supposed to be temporary. Tragedy, however, struck: Kristofferbecame ill with a terminal condition and his death cast a dark shadow over a once tightly-knit household. Einshøj’s parents were had another son, Alex, but they would never return to Denmark to live as a family again.Through voiceover, Einshøj recalls this painful history with profound introspection, as well as humour. Grainy home videos, largely shot by Einshøj’s father, Søren, resurface, but while Søren used his camera to preserve Kristoffer’s memories before his death, Einshøj turns to film-making as a means of reconciliation. Unable to process Kristoffer’s death, Søren retreats into the numbing grind of work. Meanwhile, Einshøj has grown apart from his surviving siblings, both of whom experience periods of depression as a result of their shared trauma.It is perhaps due to the confessional nature of Einshøj’s project that, after years of silence, the brothers finally open up to one another about their deepest fears and anxieties. At times, the documentary has the freewheeling charm of a road movie, with Einshøj embarking on various journeys to bring his scattered family together. In one particularly touching sequence, filled with the deadpan humour of Einshøj’s narration, the three brothers, now adults, dress up in superhero costumes. Behind them is the majestic mountain range of their childhood home; with the young men now standing shoulder to shoulder, a beautiful picture of love and unity emerges from the heartaches of yesterday.The Mountains is on True Story from 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFamilyDenmarkNorwayEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

There have been at least four Broadway productions and many revivals, tours and adaptations of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s 1971 biblical rock musical. Just last month, the UK saw a revivalmet with acclaim. In Los Angeles’s version,not without “backlash”, Cynthia Erivo is the Holy Messiah. Jesus, clad in white cloth and cool white boots, faces betrayal at the hands of Judas (played by a magnetic Adam Lambert).In the first half of the show, as the apostles ask Jesus about his plans, and as lepers ask him to heal them, Erivo’s Jesus is restrained and she doesn’t quite make the role fully her own: Jesus is composed even in uncertainty, steady even when overwhelmed. But immediately into the second act, after Jesus realizes a disciple will betray him and as he pleads with God against the death that awaits him, Erivo lets despair take over in Gethsemane, stoking a tender touchpoint that makes Jesus feel human but commanding, helpless and then resolute. There is no doubt that you’re in the presence of a mastery of art form, of unbridled talent as Erivo sinks to her knees and resigns to God’s will – tears filling her eyes, the music simple and her crystalline voice carrying into the night. The outpour at first doesn’t feel quite earned but, on true skill and discipline, becomes moving and stunning to witness, enthralling the audience into a minute-long standing ovation.Judas, a juicier role that runs from rebellion to righteousness to sorrow, is a punk delight. Lambert is perfectly cast, harnessing a despair that’s mightily accessible throughout: he splits the difference between someone you’d meet at a bar who’s got some regrets and someone who was born at the gates of hell. In Damned for All Time / Blood Money, as Judas wrestles with whether or not to betray Jesus and tell Pharisees and priests where he is so that they can capture him, Lambert is a wavering flag, a lilt of evil. After Jesus is taken and Judas realizes the pain he’s wrought, Lambert offers in Judas’ Death a window into a sorrow we’ve all reached for before, a glimmer of hope that you’re not as bad as what you’ve just done.Cynthia Erivo to play Dracula and 22 supporting roles in West End transfer of Australian showRead moreHamilton’s Phillipa Soo, playing Mary Magdalene, brings a buttery voice and is a smart match to Erivo’s, and governor of Judea Pontius Pilate (Raúl Esparza), a commanding presence. But perhaps because of these heavyweights, other moments are more forgettable: the choreography (especially the apostles’) feels relatively simple and fades into the background, and the fanfare of King Herod (played by a last-minute John Stamos filling in for Josh Gad, who has Covid) in Herod’s Song could have offered a thicker moment of fun and delight, but Stamos is too much bravado over jeer.The set design for the most part leaves something to be desired, primarily a large screen hovering in the back; on it are graphics that aim to be camp but land more lazily – sometimes more literal camp with a mountain range of REI-type graphics, sometimes Vaporwave-like art you’d find at a Miami DJ set.But the holiness of the Hollywood Bowl venue is undeniable: as Jesus’s followers fawn and plead or when the orchestra softens with a solo nigh, a sense of devastation seeps in, the sky above the outdoor amphitheater a deep, navy hue, God’s Earth the stage. Despite the unevenness of Jesus’s conviction and some rushed ensemble songs, this rendition captures the tragedy of devotion and the contradictions of betrayal. “I don’t know how to love him,” sing Mary and Judas, in separate scenes – and still, you know they do.Explore more on these topicsMusicalsCynthia ErivoAndrew Lloyd WebberTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The delay clearly hasn’t put off the throngs of devoted Lambs (Carey’s stans), displaying their fandom with T-shirts referencing other quotes from the diva such as “I don’t know her” and “I don’t have time for the rigmarole”.Carey appears wearing a trans flag-inspired pink, blue and white minidress and a leather jacket embroidered with the slogan “Protect the Dolls”. The opening is relentless as she storms through snippets of Type Dangerous, Emotions, Make It Happen, I’ll Be There, Vision of Love and Dreamlover. While her voice is not as pristine as it once was, her whistle register is still intact and thrills the crowd every time.After that promising start, the show falters with a setlist that hurries Carey – and the crowd – through some of her biggest hits. Fantasy is sloppy and rushed, with only one verse and chorus (plus the Ol’ Dirty Bastard rap, piped in), while a Heartbreaker/Honey mashup is similarly cut short. The crowd are eager to carry her, but even with knowing every word they struggle to keep up with the stop-start pacing.After an outfit change, covered by the first of many drum fills and dance breaks, Carey returns for #Beautiful, her 2013 duet with Miguel, which she rarely performs, exciting those fans (and there seem to be many) who have been tracking her recent setlists. She follows it up with a swaggering rendition of Obsessed – widely understood as her diss track of Eminem – and a playful Touch My Body, which marks the show hitting its peak.The best way to age? Forget the longevity bros – and be more Mariah CareyRead moreA glam moment during Say Somethin’, where the singer’s hair and makeup team come on stage mid-performance to do touchups, is as camp and silly as you’d expect from a diva such as Carey. But after another leisurely outfit change (into the next of a series of sparkly minidresses), the interludes really start to drag, and people begin to drift away. There’s no number of energetic shirtless male dancers who can keep the crowd entertained while Carey is frequently off stage and then, when she returns, increasingly going through the motions.It’s a shame, as the closing numbers feature four of Carey’s best songs from 2005’s The Emancipation of Mimi, including We Belong Together and Fly Like a Bird, but by this point many have lost interest or legged it for the train home. To anyone who thought Brighton Pride would be too small a stage for her to bring her best, Carey proved that she’s still got it, but she could have probably given a little more.Explore more on these topicsPop and rockMariah Careylive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

But at this year’s Edinburgh Fringe she will be on stage alone, doing all the ‘things I shouldn’t be doing’Paula CocozzaMon 4 Aug 2025 01.56 EDTShareAt 82, Christine Thynne is an emerging artist. “Risk! There’s a colossal amount of risk,” Thynne says. She is about to perform her show, These Mechanisms, over three weeks at the Edinburgh fringe. While “emerging” isn’t a word often applied to artists in their 80s, Thynne says the description is appropriate. “I wasn’ttherebefore,” she says. “I wasn’t a solo performer.”Thynne’s show melds aspects of her life – she trained as a physiotherapist in the 1960s – along with other passions. Among her props are planks, stepladders and water. “Things I shouldn’t be doing,” she says. “Moving scaffolding planks. Changing the shape of stepladders. Carrying water.”She enjoys sea kayaking, having progressed from being coached to paddling the Lofoten islands in Norway, in her 50s. “Sliding up a wave, going down the other side – it was so exciting,” she says. But when she was browsing the Grassmarket area ofEdinburgh, Scotland, where she lives, and saw a brochure for a class inDance Base, Scotland’s national centre for dance, she balked.View image in fullscreenDuring rehearsals for These Mechanisms.Photograph: Amy SineadThe class was free for the over-60s, and Thynne was 68. “I thought: ‘Dare I?’”For many people, kayaking in open water would be scarier than joining a dance class, but “in life”, Thynne says, “there are occasions when you can lose your self-confidence. You can lose your identity. I was very nervous, wondering could I do it, would I be good enough?”She had done a bit of ballet and tap growing up in the north-east of England, and loved sport. Not to compete, but because she “loved the way the body moved”. At 16, she wrote to the chartered society of physiotherapists, and did a course on day release while working locally at Imperial Chemical Industries.“I still love the way the body moves,” she says, “How you can feel the tension in a muscle – is it the right place you’re feeling? Which muscles are weak? Which joints are affected? And how even with simple exercise, you can make people feel much better.”After a divorce in the mid-1980s, she embarked on a second career, teaching movement and music, and anatomy and massage to therapists, while raising two teenage sons.She has loved the outdoors since her mum, who was a professional musician, took Thynne and her two sisters “out into the fresh air, to have this love of the countryside, to go brambling, to walk. She gave that to us.”Thynne, similarly, is “somebody who pushes myself, takes opportunities, takes a risk,” she says. “I’m obviously prepared to go on trying and doing, [asking] can I do this? And then being surprised that yes, I can.”When she went to her first dance session, it was “won-der-ful!” she says, singing the word. “I realised that somebody was teaching me what to do, and there was music playing and I could let go and I felt that joy of my body moving, coming through me.”She progressed to Prime, Dance Base’s semi-professional company for over-60s. After that came funding fromLuminate, Dance Base,Creative Scotlandand Made in Scotland. For These Mechanisms, she has collaborated with the choreographer Robbie Synge. “It’s almost as if I’m having another career.”Along the way, she has learned “to listen … to find out more about myself, my capabilities. How to put my point of view forward, to be part of a team.” She hopes to tour the show overseas.View image in fullscreenChristine Thynne performing with Prime dance company in 2023.Photograph: Amy SineadIn the meantime, she keeps fit. “Each morning, I hang for two or three minutes, take my body weight, then I turn around and hang the other way. Then I do some gentle stretching.” And, of course, she dances. All the time. “I probably dance if I am going from the fridge to the cooker, taking some dishes,” she says, swirling her hands in the air. “Isn’t that what dance is? You just have to let go and explore it.”These Mechanisms isn’t exactly autobiographical, but it “tells a story of persistence, of joy, of risk”, which sounds like Thynne. “You could do this in your 20s, you could do it in your 80s,” she says. “It’s about the limits of the human body and the desire to make things happen.”These Mechanismsruns until 20 August at DB3 as part of Dance Base’s fringe programme, delivered in partnership with Assembly festivalTell us: has your life taken a new directionafter the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60DanceAgeingEdinburgh festivalEdinburgh festival 2025FestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, of course, conductor Robin Ticciati reverts to Janáček’s original score. I didn’t see Michieletto’s original, however, and so cannot tell how much may have changed dramatically.An inconsistent staging, it transforms an essentially naturalistic work into a symbolist exploration of its heroine’s mind, and an opera essentially about the darkness of the human soul, is now reimagined in antiseptic, clinical white. There’s little suggestion of the natural world that mirrors the central crisis, only a phosphorescent glare seen between the cracks of the white walls that hem Kateřina Kněžíková’s Káťa in. Michieletto is unsparing in his depiction of Kabanicha’s (Susan Bickley) abuse, yet at the same time, the social background is curiously vague here, and we lose sight of Káťa’s tragedy as emblematic of conflicts between reactionary authoritarianism and emerging liberalism.View image in fullscreenInner conflict … Kateřina Kněžíková (Káťa) in Káťa Kabanová at Glyndebourne, July 2025.Photograph: Marc Brenner/Glyndebourne ProductionsInstead, Michieletto realises her dreams and fantasies. She imagines flying free like a bird, though bird cages, proliferating on stage, only serve to enhance her growing sense of entrapment. The angel she dreamt of in church as a child, now stalks her adult imagination, wounded, its wings bloodied. This ambivalent figure, male and stripped to the waist in 2021, has now become female androgynous and Byzantine, though the image is overused. Its feathers flutter down as Kněžíková yields to Nicky Spence’s Boris, though Michieletto ruins the subsequent love scene by bringing Bickley on stage to pluck the angel’s wings and immure it in a cage, a horrendous distraction. Michieletto doesn’t always trust the score: in Act I, the exquisite passage intended to mark Káťa’s first appearance now accompanies furtive groping between Sam Furness’s Kudrjáš and Rachael Wilson’s Varvara, leaving Kněžíková to slope on a few minutes later, though we have already seen her during the prelude.Much of it sounds extremely fine, however, though Ticciati, conducting the London Philharmonic, is perhaps stronger on the score’s lyricism than its incipient violence: the close of Act I, and indeed the climactic storm that unhinges Káťa’s mind, could have been more tense than they were on opening night. Kněžíková is really lovely in the title role, her tone silvery yet warm, her dynamic control immaculate, vivid in her delineation of Káťa’s inner conflict. Spence sounds wonderfully ardent, but by the end we are also painfully aware of Boris’s essential cowardice and weakness of will. Bickley, tremendous here, gives us her most terrifying Kabanicha yet. Furness and Wilson, meanwhile, are just delightful as the couple who manage to escape the nightmare that surrounds them. A flawed production, but finely sung.In repertory until 23 AugustExplore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicGlyndebourneLeoš JanáčekLondon Philharmonic OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

A runaway train is hurtling towards five people tied to the tracks. You can pull a lever to divert the train to a different track to which only one person is tied. Do you intervene to kill the one and spare the five?What if one of the tracks twisted into a really cool loop-the-loop? Or the trolley was replaced by a bloodthirsty Thomas the Tank Engine? Or the whole dilemma was clumsily altered to comment on the political controversy of the day? Originally formulated as a reflection on moral decision-making, the trolley problem found a second life in the 2010s as a well of inspiration for variously silly, irreverent and self-referential trolley-based memes. Now, it may be entering its third era as surreal interactive comedy game The Trolley Solution.Each level plays as a minigame tenuously shaped around the thought experiment. There’s always a trolley, a lever and a pseudo-ethical dilemma, plus a twist to throw everything off the rails. The track is dissected into puzzle pieces that you must reassemble against the clock. A commuter next to the rails needs help remaining emotionally stable by balancing the blasts of serotonin they receive from scrolling social media. One level spirals into a short visual novel about a Japanese girl falling in love with a tram that threatens to murder her high school rival.View image in fullscreenIdeally suited to the era of social media … The Trolley Solution.Photograph: byDanDansIt is, obviously, all very silly, and sees in the trolley problem the same absurdity as the memes. “It’s a serious matter presented in a kind of ridiculous way,” says solo Chilean developer byDanDans. Or, as he puts it in terms of a Reddit thread: “It’s free real estate for shit-posting.”With the basic gag already well worn, byDanDans focused on iterating the dilemma into quirkier scenarios and experimenting broadly with the minigames, before nailing down the final selection. “Some iterations were too bland, too unfunny,” he says. “Or I just couldn’t think of a minigame that followed the four rules I set for myself.” Those rules being that each minigame needed to be fun, connected to the dilemma that unlocks it, do something that hasn’t been seen before, and subvert expectations.Even so, if all this sounds a bit gimmicky that’s largely because it is. The trolley solution may be best thought of as an extended interactive sketch show based around a single joke. But it’s a joke with enough charm and a quick enough punchline (each minigame lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes, and the level select screen hints at a concise total run time) that it shouldn’t become stale.In many ways, it’s also ideally suited to the era of social media. The humour is internet-coded and the bite-size minigames are a perfect fit for quickfire TikToks pitched to video game laymen. “I did try to make something easy to pick up and finish,” says byDanDans. “My previous games were too technical and too hardcore for most players. I tried to make something anyone could enjoy.”Enjoy is a slightly weird word to use in the context of an ethical dilemma. If byDanDans were faced with the original trolley problem, what would he do? “I’d have to go with the option that leads to fewer legal repercussions,” he says. “I’d call the cops, scream for help, and try to untie or push them off the tracks.” So he’d ignore the parameters of the thought experiment and concoct a far-fetched scheme for added excitement? That tallies.The Trolley Solution is set for release on PC this winterExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even if you don’t have your own kayak or paddleboard festering in the garage, there are dozens of excellent hire places and guided tours up and down the country, on beautiful rivers, lakes, canals and coastlines. I’ve spent a couple of years researching a book about the loveliest, and here are five of my favourites.Whisky and wildlife, HighlandsFor many years theOld Forge Inn– often referred to as the most remote pub in mainland Britain – was well known for its live music sessions that would break out when the whisky started flowing. Locals and visitors were often moved to take down the musical instruments hanging on the walls and burst into tune. It sounded like the best party in the land, all the more so for the degree of difficulty it took to reach it, and the ridiculous beauty of the surroundings. It’s the only pub in the only village, Inverie, on the Knoydart peninsula, a heathery, mountainous hunk of the Scottish west coast that juts between three deep sea lochs, where seals play and white-tailed eagles soar.And now it’s back. There was a period when things went off the boil under new ownership and the parties dwindled, but in 2022 it was bought by the community and thrives once more. Its pontoon has space for six boats, or you can pull up on the beaches nearby.View image in fullscreenThe village of Inverie.Photograph: John Peter/AlamyTheKnoydart Brewery, occupying a deconsecrated Roman Catholic chapel here, supplies the house ales, while a Knoydart venison burger (£18) from the local deer estate is a menu must, along with cullen skink (£11).As there is no road access, people come by ferry from Mallaig, make the 15-milehike from Kinloch Hourn(a taxi ride from Fort William), or even kayak over – a strenuous and splashy seven miles. Far easier is to hire a kayak when you get there fromLove Knoydartand explore the edges of the pristine loch, looking out for sea otters.On of the best places to stay is theBunkhouse, which has dorms and camping with views to the Isle of Rum (dorm beds from £29pp).Arisaig Sea Kayak Centrecan tailor-make day and multi-day wild camping trips in the area from £130pp per day, minimum four people.A beaver safari in KentView image in fullscreenA beaver at Ham Fen, Kent.Photograph: Whittaker Wildlife UK/AlamyHunted for their pelts to near extinction by the 16th century, beavers have been re-established in certain British rivers, including a stretch of the River Stour near Canterbury. They were reintroduced in 2001 at Ham Fen, aKent Wildlife Reservesite near Sandwich, where they thrived and spread.The most enchanting way to spot nature’s cutest carpenters is on a sunset safari by Canadian canoe down the chalk stream waterway, which ends at a riverside pub.Canoe Wild(£37pp) runs an atmospheric trip, timed to pass the places the beavers visit most frequently at dusk, when they’re most active.Starting at Grove Ferry, you’re whisked by minibus to the village of Fordwich for a guided paddle back of just under five miles. On my September trip, a glorious pink sunset was the backdrop at Bootleg Lake, around which many beavers have dens, and we began to notice slippery mud chutes pocked with paw prints. Then, in the near dark … two loud splashes, and a dark shape careering into the water. “Definitely a beaver,” whispered the guides. “When they hear something coming, they whack their wide tails onto the water to scare away predators.”Even a shadowy splosh felt Attenborough-level exciting under a blazing Milky Way, and we finished in the fairy-lit beer garden of the ivy-wreathedGrove Ferry Inn.Nethergongcampsite nearby has pitches from £42.50, as well as a sauna, yoga and bushcraft classes.A hidden brewery in HampshireView image in fullscreenA creek off the River Hamble leads to the Hidden Tap bar, where drinks are lowered down to the stream.Photograph: Gemma BowesThis fantastically quirky paddle involves a hidden creek, accessible only at high tide, and a place where you can order your drink to be brought straight to your paddleboard or kayak.This beer pilgrimage is on the tidal River Hamble, a baby river of 6.3 miles that flows east of Southampton towards the Solent. At its narrow upper end, near Botley, spidery creeks run off at the sides, including one leading to the Botley Brewery’sHidden Tap bar.Those with their own kit can park at Burridge recreation ground on the east side of the river, then follow a leafy footpath through woods to the water. Or launch further upriver from YMCA Fairthorne (for a £5.50 fee), which rents paddleboards and kayaks and has a cafe and campsite (hire from£20, pitches for four people from£39).Heading upstream towards Botley, the river becomes gentler, narrower and shallower until it feels like an otherworldly bayou. Set off at least two hours before high tide so it’s high at the upper, final navigable end of the river, follow the stream through a tunnel and emerge at the foot of the brewery wall. You yell your order up and your pint is lowered down in a wooden box to be sipped while you float.Another short channel, Curbridge Creek, leads to theHorse and Jockeypub’s waterside beer garden.Let off steam by the SevernView image in fullscreenOne-way canoeing on the River Severn (you take the train back, avoiding paddling upstream)Paddling back the way you’ve come can be a downer, not to mention hard work if it means going against the flow, soRiver Severn Canoes’ solution is rather brilliant. At the end of its self-guided trips down the River Severn from the Shropshire town of Bridgnorth you abandon your vessel and catch asteam train backon the Severn Valley Railway to Highley (£15). Routes of several lengths are available, including four hours to Arley (10½ miles).Halfway along there’s a picnic stop on a beach at the village of Hampton Loade, where you could also have a cuppa and a jacket potato at theUnicorn Inn(mains from £7). It has nine (quite basic) B&B rooms as well as a campsite (pitches for one tent sleeping 2-4 people from £20), if you want to make this your base.Finish in Upper Arley in Worcestershire, home to another traditional, 500-year-old pub,The Harbour. Trains run between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth, stopping at Bewdley, Arley and Hampton Loade. Those with their own kayak or SUP can take them on the train for a £5 fee.In Bridgnorth,The Falcon Hotel(doubles from £140) has 14 rooms with whitewashed beams and exposed brick. River Severn Canoes also offers multi-day trips down the river, stopping at campsites.Kingfishers and canoes in CardiganView image in fullscreenA geodesic dome at the Fforest Farm glamping sitePaddling along the thickly wooded tidal gorge of the River Teifi in Canadian canoes feels utterly otherworldly: peregrine falcons zip from steep banks, kingfishers dart above water busy with salmon, sewin (sea trout) and otters, and there’s a little patch of rapids to tackle on an otherwise gentle two-hour tour withHeritage Canoes(£45 adults/£32.50 children). From its woodland base at theWelsh Wildlife Centre and Teifi Marshes nature reserveit’s two miles upriver to Cilgerran, where a 13th-centurycastletowers above the river.Stay at glamping siteFforest Farm(two nights’ B&B for two from £340), a 10-minute drive east of Cardigan, with a range of cabins and tents – the geodesic domes come with their own Japanese-style wooden bathhouse with a super-deep tub. The site has its own atmospheric pub, Y Bwthyn, in a barely converted barn only open to guests, where candles send their twitchy glow onto slate windowsills, cocktails are made with foraged botanicals and local ale comes fresh from the cask. Cilgerran has a couple of heartwarming pubs, including the Cardiff Arms (no website), with a coracle hung outside; or head to Cardigan’s waterside bar atAlbion Aberteifi, Fforest’s hip apart-hotel, or, on the opposite bank, itsPizzatipi, which has a festival feel.Gemma Bowes’Paddle and Pubis published byBloomsbury(£19.99).

We often make a mother sauce of tomatoes and onions, then add spices and seasonings such as chilli flakes, garlic, ginger, nutmeg and cumin for a moreish bold and fiery pepper sauce.West African spice-crusted lamb with tomato saladThis is inspired by the night-time meat vendors on the old railway line in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Cooking and eating it takes me straight back there every time.Prep15 minChill30 minCook50 minServes636-bone racks of lamb, French-trimmed (ask the butcher to do this, if need be)For the spice mix½ whole nutmeg, grated½ tsp ground black cardamom½ tsp scotch bonnet chilli flakes, or chilli powder1 tsp ground ginger1 tsp garlic powder1 tsp onion powder1 tsp smoked paprika½tsp salt25g dry roasted peanuts, choppedFor the crust150g softened unsalted butter10 tbsp fresh breadcrumbs25g finely chopped mixed fresh herbs– I like parsley, chives and thyme1 tsp saltFor the salad1 tbsp white-wine vinegar3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil½ tsp caster sugar½ tsp salt2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped2 stalksfresh tarragon, leaves picked and finely chopped500g ripetomatoes– you want as many different shapes and colours as possible, so go for heritage varieties if you canPut all the spices in a spice or coffee grinder (or mortar), add the salt and peanuts, and grind to a rough powder – don’t overprocess it. Put a small, dry frying pan on a low heat, add the spices and cook, stirring, for about five minutes, until very fragrant. Tip into a small bowl and leave to cool.For the crust, in a small bowl, mix the butter, spice mix, breadcrumbs and herbs until well combined.Season the lamb racks with salt, then press a thin layer of the crust on to the fat side of the lamb racks. Put them in a shallow roasting tin and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes, to firm up the crust.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, and take the lamb out of the fridge 10 minutes before you want to cook it.Roast for 20-25 minutes, then remove and rest for 10 minutes.Meanwhile, make the salad. In a small bowl, whisk the vinegar, oil, sugar and salt, then stir in the shallots and tarragon. Slice the tomatoes, arrange them on a larger platter and pour the dressing over the top.Slice the rested lamb into individual ribs and serve with the salad.Plantain and feta hand pies with tomato salsaView image in fullscreenHand pies are a popular Sierra Leonean party food, and these ones, with sweet plantain, salty feta and a spicy salsa, are perfect for a summer get-together.Prep15 minCook3 hr 30 minChill1 hrMakes10 small piesFor the salsa10 large plum tomatoes, halved lengthways, cored and deseeded1 tsp saltA few twists ofblack pepper1 tspchopped fresh oregano6 tbsp olive oil1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed¼ tsp finely chopped scotch bonnet25g fresh coriander, finely choppedFor the pies4 yellow plantains30g unsalted butter1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped400g feta150g plain flour, plus extra for dusting1 tsp saltSunflower oil, for deep-fryingHeat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1. Line a baking sheet with greaseproof paper and arrange the tomatoes halves on top in a single layer. Sprinkle with the salt, pepper, oregano and two tablespoons of the oil, then slow-roast for about three hours, until the tomatoes are shrivelled at the edges but still plump in the middle.Then make a start on the pies. Increase the oven temperature to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. Wash and drythe plantains, put them on a baking sheet, roast for 40-50 minutes, until soft, then remove.Melt the butter in a saucepan on a gentle heat, then add the chopped onion, cover and cook very gently for up to an hour, until softened and golden brown. Transfer to a bowl, leave to cool completely, then crumble in the feta.When the plantains are cool enough to handle, peel off the skins, put the flesh in a food processor and pulse to a smooth mash. Scrape into a bowl, add the flour and salt and mix to make a smooth dough. Wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.While the dough is chilling, make the salsa. Heat the remaining four tablespoons of oil in a saucepan, add the onions, cover and cook gently for 10 minutes, until softened. Add the garlic and chilli, and cook for another two minutes. Finely chop the roast tomatoes, add them to the pan, then take off the heat.Now fill the pies. Divide the dough into 10 equal pieces, then, using a rolling pin or a tortilla press, flatten each piece into a thin 15cm round. Spoon two tablespoons of the feta mixture into the centre of each circle of dough, fold over to enclose and use your fingers to crimp and seal the edges.To finish, gently reheat the salsa, if need be, then stir in the coriander. Heat the deep-frying oil in a wok or deep pan over a medium-high flame, then, working in batches, fry the pies for three to five minutes, until golden all over. Lift out with a slotted spoon, drain on a plate lined with kitchen towel, and serve at once with the warm salsa for dipping.Maria Bradford is a chef and food writer, and owner ofShwen Shwenin Sevenoaks, Kent.
