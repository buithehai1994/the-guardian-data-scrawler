Home Office data shows just 23,000 young people came into the UK as part of the scheme in 2023, with 9,900 of them from Australia.Signalling a melting away of Eurosceptic resistance to any special youth visa deal with the EU, the Brexit campaigner and former government minister Steve Baker has given it his backing, saying it would be a “good thing” and “absolutely would not amount to a return to EU free movement”.But the former chair of the European Research Group called the controversy over the scheme a “red herring” designed to distract voter attention from a food and drink standards deal that is also being mooted, which he says would put a US trade agreement in jeopardy.The environment secretary, Steve Reed, insisted the government was not going to “breach” its manifesto commitments on freedom of movement, telling Times Radio: “We’re very clear in our manifesto that there won’t be any return to the single market, the customs union or freedom of movement, and that remains our position.”Speaking in Washington before a meeting with the US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, saidthe UK’s trading relationship with the EU was “arguably even more important”than its relationship with the US.The German ambassador to the UK has said he was “really optimistic” about the prospects of a youth mobility scheme deal being reached, after a meeting between Keir Starmer and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, on Thursday. Ambassadors in Europe will be debriefed next Wednesday.Miguel Berger told the BBC Radio 4: “I am now pretty optimistic that we are moving in a good direction.“It would make it possible for young people with parents with a lower income to experience the possibility to work abroad, to learn a language, and we would like to have this in both directions,” Berger said.“There is a very serious and dedicated preparatory work for the summit on May 19,” he said referring to the UK-EU summit to be held in London next month.Baker said: “To have a capped, time-limited scheme for European young people would be a good thing, and absolutely would not amount to a return to EU free movement, which is uncapped for unlimited duration and requires nations to treat European citizens as their own. Any confusion over this should be quickly cleared up.”But he urged that more attention be paid to the possibility of a sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal to eliminate checks on food and drink exports, saying anything that obliged the UK to follow EU rules again would compromise a US trade deal and economic growth to sustain pension payouts 10 years down the line.Baker said: “While we are arguing about this complete red herring, the UK looks set to take EU rules on food and products, which will put us in breach of our obligations under the Pacific Rim trade deal and rule out doing a trade deal with the USA. That matters, because that’s where the economic growth is going to come from. And without growth, we will default on pension obligations.”Labour and the EU are working on seven pillars that would then feed into a declaration known as a “common understanding”, which would be followed by detailed negotiations to hammer out the specifics.“No decisions are expected to be made during the summit itself. At most, there could be a mutual commitment to exploring possible avenues for an agreement on these issues,” said a EU source.The seven areas are: defence and security, carbon pricing, migration, youth experience, energy, and fishing, but some groups say the talks lack ambition.Some member states are also making a “strong ask” for the UK to return to the Erasmus+ university and vocational exchange programme and a deal to allow citizens to study in each others universities paying home fees. This is something of a non-starter for the UK because of the imbalance of students coming to Britain in the past compared to British studying in the EU.An official business consultation body set up under the Brexit trade and cooperation agreement has called on the government to go further in its negotiations and seek the removal of bans on the export of British seed potatoes to the EU, of barriers on batch testing of pharmaceuticals, and mutual recognition agreements on professional qualifications.The Domestic Advisory Group is also asking for removal of barriers for touring musicians and artists and their support staff.In a submission to the UK government it also calls for an agreement to allow easier access to veterinary medicines in Northern Ireland and a return to joint regulation for chemicals.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionBrexitEuropeYoung peopleShareReuse this content"

He was the son of Juliane Gallina, who was appointed thedeputy director for digital innovation at the Central Intelligence Agencyin February 2024.The story of how the son of a top-ranking US spy died fighting for Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion ofUkraineis an unlikely tale of how homegrown anger at the United States and online radicalisation led from a middle-class Virginia childhood to the killing fields of eastern Ukraine.On a VKontakte page attributed to Gloss, a high school football player born to parents who both served in the military, he described himself as “a supporter of the multipolar world. I ran away from home. traveled the world. I hate fascism. I love my homeland.” He also posted the flags ofRussiaand Palestine.According to the investigative website iStories,Gloss is one of more than 1,500 foreigners who have signed contracts with the Russian military since February 2022. The database for the enrollment office was later leaked, exposing him as having signed the contract in September 2023. Sources told iStories that Gloss had been deployed with “assault units”, those engaged in harsh frontline fighting, in December 2023. An acquaintance said that he had been deployed to a Russian airborne regiment sent to storm Ukrainian positions near the city of Soledar.“With his noble heart and warrior spirit Michael was forging his own hero’s journey when he was tragically killed in EasternEuropeon April 4, 2024,” his family wrote in the obituary, which did not mention Russia and Ukraine or discuss the circumstances of his death.In university, Gloss was active in gender equality and environmental protest circles. He joined Rainbow Family, a leftwing environmental protest group, and in 2023 traveled to Hatay, Turkey, to assist in the recovery followingthe earthquake that killed more than 56,000 people. He had also become increasingly angry at the US for its support of Israel and the war in Gaza.While in Turkey, Gloss began expressing a desire to go on to Russia. “He was usually watching videos about Palestine and was so angry at America,” one acquaintance told iStories. “He started thinking about going to Russia. He wanted to war with the USA. But I think he was very influenced by the conspiracy theory videos.”The Determined Spy: Frank Wisner, the CIA and a covert career cut shortRead moreAfter receiving a visa to Russia, he traveled around the country before arriving in Moscow, where he joined the military shortly before his documents expired. Photographs and videos obtained by iStories showed he was sent to a Russian training camp, where he mostly trained alongsideNepali contract soldiers. Three months after enlisting, an acquaintance said, he was deployed to Ukraine as a member of an assault battalion.A number of acquaintances told the outlet that he had not been interested in fighting, but hoped the army would allow him to receive a Russian passport and stay in the country.The circumstance’s of Gloss’s death are not known. A friend said that his family had been informed by the Russian government of his death but were given little other information. “It was announced that he died within the borders of Ukraine,” the friend wrote. “We do not know whether he participated in the war. They did not provide any other detailed information.”It was not clear whether the Russians performed a background check on Gloss or knew the identity of his mother.

Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, also said he wanted to bring together a coalition of the right, though he insisted he was talking about bringing back voters,not a deal with Farage’s party.Is one-nation Toryism dead? Not yet, but it can’t let Reform and the right provide all the answers | Henry HillRead moreMany Tories believe Jenrick has already embarked on a thinly disguised leadership campaign, which he denies. Houchen is also thought of as a possible future leadership contender, with some of his rivals believing he could give up his peerage and seek to enter parliament through a byelection.Conservative MPs said privately that there were constant whispers and rumours in the tea rooms about “regicide” of Badenoch by submitting letters of no confidence if the results next week are a wipeout, although the majority view was that it would not be possible after giving her such a short time in charge.Jenrick on Friday said he was on “exactly the same page” as Badenoch, and wanted to “put Reform out of business”. He also said he thought Badenoch was doing a “bloody good job” and called for people to “give her a break”.Jenrick weighed in behind his leader in an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain about his campaign against stolen tools, which sources said had been set up initially without the knowledge of Conservative HQ – although he approached Badenoch for permission to make the media appearance on Thursday and was given approval to go ahead. Both their teams insisted it was fully sanctioned and there was nothing unusual about the process.In her own remarks to reporters on Friday, Badenoch confirmed: “We are not doing a deal with Reform, there’s not going to be a pact. What we need to do right now is focus on ensuring that voters have a credible Conservative offer.”Mitchell, an ex-chief whip and development secretary, said his colleagues should heed the historic words of Rear Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles who told the 1922 Committee in 1971: “Pro bono publico, no bloody panico”.“Reform is trying to destroy the Conservative party and at the last election Reform may have taken five seats off us but the Lib Dems took nearly 60,” Mitchell said. “The right way to deal with Reform is not to talk about deals, which is a sign of weakness, but spend time developing the right policies.“Leading the Conservative party now is an extremely difficult job and I don’t believe the archangel Gabriel would be doing a better job.”View image in fullscreenSome moderate Conservative MPs say they want to see less aping of Nigel Farage’s Reform and a ‘more honest’ case for why the Tories should be the answer.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAHis position was echoed by Simon Hoare, a former housing minister, who said: “Without sounding too much like Corporal Jones, this is ‘don’t panic’.“It’s an early staging post after the general election. A parliament is a marathon not a sprint. We are not even a year since the general election, and it will be a five year parliament. We’ve got to take our fences slowly and steadily and our key challenge as a parliamentary party is to prove ourselves steady under fire, [and be] calm, rational and mature.”Another senior Conservative said the “prevailing mood is headless chicken” in relation to Reform, but MPs need to “stop panicking about Reform and think how bad it would look” to depose another leader.Glen, who attended cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury, said Badenoch had been elected after “an exhaustive process” and that she has been in post for less than six months.“The next general election is over four years away and all Conservative MPs know we have a lot of hard work ahead to rebuild trust,” he said. “There are no short cuts to this process but Kemi has set out the pathway to recovery based on thorough policy work and honesty with the electorate. Next week’s elections are likely to be tough but I have every confidence Kemi has a clear plan and she should not be pushed off course by any outcome we face next week.”Some moderate Conservative MPs, however, said they wanted to see less aping of Reform and a “much more honest” case for why theConservativesshould be the answer. A former minister said the message should be that those voting Reform have “legitimate grievances” especially on economics, and a clear offer with serious policymaking to address how Britain’s low wage economy and open welfare state is “sucking in migrants”.On the prospect of a deal with Reform, one centrist MP said: “I can see why some people would welcome this as a sort of instant hit, something which might give a quick boost, but in the longer term it would make it much harder for us to win elections, and it would really risk splitting the party.“Views are mixed, but there would be a significant number of people who would just not be comfortable campaigning under a Reform banner. And if you think about the areas where we lost so many seats to the Lib Dems, it would make things even worse. As a statement of intent it’s pretty big: as a party we have decided to effectively abandon one wing of opinion.”Another sceptical Tory MP said uniting the Conservatives and Reform would be an “unbelievably poisonous marriage” that would not be sustainable.Explore more on these topicsConservativesReform UKKemi BadenochRobert JenrickAndrew MitchellnewsShareReuse this content"

Video of the incident showed him taking out the heavy tool and then repeatedly swinging it at Pyke’s head.Pyke fell to the floor and attempted to kick away Felton before colleagues at St Joseph’s Roman Catholic comprehensive school in Aberavon, southWales, heard the disturbance and came to his aid.When graphic CCTV footageof the incident was played to Swansea crown court there were gasps in the public gallery at the ferocity of the attack.Ieuan Rees, for the prosecution, said Felton believed Pyke had slept with another teacher with whom he had recently been in a relationship.“The evidence of his wife and the admissions he made to her suggested Mr Felton had been in a relationship with another member of staff and had recently discovered he was the father of her child,” he said.“Furthermore, he believed that Mr Pyke had now begun his own relationship with that lady.”After the attack, Felton fled the school in his car and then emailed staff to apologise “for the problems and distress his actions were likely to cause”, the court heard.Felton, who had been headteacher since September 2023, pleaded guilty to attempted grievous bodily harm with intent, at a hearing earlier this month.In a victim impact statement address to Felton, Pyke said: “You had my complete trust in every way and you used that to manoeuvre me into a position of utter vulnerability. And then you attacked me from behind.”He added: “The fear that you could attempt to do me such harm, smiling at me just seconds before, will always be with me.”On Friday, Judge Paul Thomas sentenced Felton to two years and four months in jail and issued an indefinite restraining order.The judge said the “ambush” by a headteacher on their deputy was: “I suspect, entirely without precedent”.He added: “You are more than intelligent enough to realise when you plotted this bizarre attack that the impact and ramifications would be immense and far-reaching.“Ultimately, the trigger for your act of extreme violence was of your own doing, the overwhelming sexual jealousy arising from an adulterous affair and the uncontrollable rage it created in you.”John Hipkin KC, speaking for the defence, said Felton had recently suffered due to the death of his mother and a cancer diagnosis.After the attack, police said Pyke had been discharged from hospital after suffering minor injuries.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCrimeWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Heinous LOSER behaviour.”Responding on Instagram to the interaction, Ra’ouf applauded Pascal and said he also felt the “immense pain” of the silence of other celebrities.Pascal has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and is frequently accompanied on the red carpet by his transgender sister, Lux.Rowling has attracted some backlash to a photograph she posted of herself last week, smoking a cigar on a yacht with the caption: “I love it when a plan comes together.”This came after the UK supreme court sitting in London ruled that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman and biological sex. The action to determine this had been brought by For Women Scotland, a campaign group which brought a case against the Scottish government in which they argued that sex-based protections should only apply to those born female.Rowling wrote on X: “It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the supreme court and, in winning, they’ve protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,” adding, “For Women Scotland, I’m so proud to know you.”In February, Pascal shared the quote: “A world without trans people has never existed and never will,” on Instagram, dividing his followers. After some threatened to unfollow him, he reiterated his stance, writing: “I can’t think of anything more vile and small and pathetic than terrorising the smallest, most vulnerable community of people who want nothing from you, except the right to exist.”Earlier this week, he wore a T-shirt reading: “Protect the Dolls” to the London premiere of Marvel’s Thunderbolts*, part of a pro-trans campaign by American designer Conner Ives.HBO reveals first part of Harry Potter TV cast, including Dumbledore and HagridRead moreSome of the cast of the new HBO Harry Potter series have experienced online abuse in response to their involvement. However, all three of the key actors so far revealed have also played landmark LGBTQ+ roles. John Lithgow, who will play Albus Dumbledore, won much acclaim for his performance as a transgender woman in 1982’s The World According to Garp.Janet McTeer, who takes over as Professor McGonagall, played a trans man in 2011’s Albert Nobbs, while Paapa Essiedu (cast as Prof Snape) has frequently played queer roles, most notably in I May Destroy You and the short film Femme, in which he played a gay drag performer.The series begins filming later this year. Casting of the leading children’s roles has yet to be announced.This article was amended on 25 April 2025.

That line has been crossed.”A spokesperson said York Minster was working with the organisers to “ensure this event aligns with our values, and we are really excited by the opportunities it affords to showcase the minster’s musical tradition, building, and the diversity of the people who find a home here”.Explore more on these topicsYorkMetalChristianityReligionAnglicanismnewsShareReuse this content"

The pair searched for her with the help of locals but to no avail.Then, in March, reports began coming in that Valerie had been spotted.

As a youth, the retired salesman from Milan had “conflict” with the Catholic church but in Francis he saw compassion and sympathy. “A very beautiful man.”Vatican readies for Pope Francis’s funeral as world leaders head to RomeRead moreCurti was among more than 130,000 people who queued to enter the great bronze doors and cast a final gaze on the body before Friday night’s ritual “sealing of the coffin”, and before cardinals,monarchs and heads of stateturn Saturday’sfuneralinto a pageant for the ages.Even for a city long accustomed to spectacle, it will be a logistical and psychological challenge, and there is a sense of Rome holding its breath as thousands of police deploy and tens and possibly hundreds of thousands of people converge.Sadness at Francis’s passing is tinged with giddiness at holding the world’s gaze with what feels like a cocktail of funeral, Catholic jubilee and global political summit. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales, said the Vatican and Rome were masters of choreography. “They actually are geniuses at dealing with these big events. I think they’ve been doing it since the emperors ruled Rome – that they know how to deal with big egos.”View image in fullscreenMembers of the public pay their respects to Pope Francis as he lies in state inside St Peter’s basilica.Photograph: Angelo Carconi/EPASellers of papal memorabilia are doing brisk trade but Francis’s image and name are hardly ubiquitous, a sign perhaps that there is not the same personality cult, or calls for instant sainthood, that followed the death of John Paul II in 2005. Francis evokes affection and gratitude – “Grazie Francesco”, says a banner opposite the basilica where he will be buried – rather than intense reverence.Historians will debate the legacy of a 12-year papal reign spanning 2013 until Easter Monday, when the 88-year-olddied after a stroke, but many of those who paid homage to the corpse under the baroque canopy had already made up their minds.When is Pope Francis’s funeral, who will be there and what happens nextRead more“Pope Francis was full of humility. He was very humble and of the people,” said Breege Morris, a teacher from Dublin. “There was something so sincere and beautiful about him. It means everything to me to be here.”Others credited his stoicism and humour in the midst of illness. “He was a great example of strength,” said Paola, 25, a pilgrim from the Italian town of Rieti.View image in fullscreenElisabeth Krupinsky, a US student, queueing to pay her respects to Pope Francis at St Peter’s basilica.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianThere were no grandiose claims that Francis had reshaped geopolitics or transformed the church – Catholic doctrine and dogma remain largely unchanged – but there were paeans to his warmth and humanity and defence of the poor and the marginalised.“He always took care of those who didn’t have much,” said Constantin Hanenberg, 33, from Germany. He singled out Francis’s advocacy for migrants and refugees. “I hope the next pope replaces that voice.”Elisabeth Krupinsky, 20, a US student, said Francis had inspired people from all religious backgrounds. “He was such a great guy. He cared for all people no matter who or what you were. He was very accepting.” His remark in relation to LGBTQ people – “who am I to judge?” – resonated across the world, said Krupinsky.“He was a powerful voice. To see this progressive force die makes me a little anxious.”Social conservatives also found reason to laud the 266th pope, noting that he did not bow to pressure to change rules on female priests, same-sex marriage or abortion. Others who expressed disappointment the Vatican had not done more to reform institutions in the wake of sexual and financial scandals still believed the late pontiff had his heart in the right place. Like a Bernini sculpture, it seemed that Francis could be appreciated from multiple angles.View image in fullscreenBarbara McCourt outside Santa Maria Maggiore, the basilica in Rome that Pope Francis chose as his burial place.Photograph: Rory Carroll/The GuardianThe queues at St Peter’s also attracted tourists whose visit to Rome had coincided with history and so they added coffin-viewing to the itinerary. Some took selfies as they neared the altar, drawing rebukes from Vatican officials. “No phones, no cameras!”The funeral, however, will be filmed from every angle, with Francis’s plea for simplicity overwhelmed by a millennia of tradition and grandeur and 21st-century security.After the funeral mass at St Peter’s square ends, and the prime ministers, presidents, kings and queens disperse, ordinary people will get a final chance to salute the late bishop of Rome – reportedly his favourite title – when the coffin is transported across the city to Santa Maria Maggiore (Saint Mary Major), a fourth-century basilica that Francis requested as his burial place, instead of the traditional, and grander, St Peter’s. A group of the “poor and needy” will greet the coffin, the Vatican said.Some pilgrims and sightseers were already gathering atSanta Maria Maggioreon Friday afternoon. Among them was Barbara McCourt, a Catholic from Zambia who had viewed Francis lying in state. “It was quite emotional. He looked smaller than I expected.” She will miss the Argentinian pope. “He didn’t judge people. He was caring.”Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisCatholicismChristianityReligionThe papacyItaly women's rugby union teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And with that statement, the US president made clear that he wanted to carve up another country, Ukraine, and so legitimise the forcible seizure of land made by Moscow 11 years ago.From reading the transcript of the interview, Trump’s thinking is hardly coherent. Crimea, he says, wouldn’t have been seized if he had been president in 2014, but “it was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama” and now Crimea has “been with them [Russia] for a long time” – so it is time to accept the seizure.Trump envoy meets Putin hours after Moscow killing of Russian generalRead moreThe president does not even pursue the argument that a recognition of Russia’s occupation of Crimea is a necessary price of ending Russian military assault onUkraine, though perhaps he thinks it – and instead the conversation is moved on by the reporters to discussing Trump’s aspirations for annexing Greenland and Canada. “The only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state,” he added.Wars seldom end satisfactorily. The struggle, violence and sacrifice often does not bear the promised fruit. Invaded suddenly by Russia, Ukraine fought off the capture of Kyiv and existential collapse in the spring, summer and autumn of 2022 but has been unable to expel the attackers since, leaving Kyiv facing the reality of Russia occupying about 18% of its territory.But the proposed US settlement term sheet –now in the public domainand verified by Trump’s comments about Crimea – is redolent of great power thinking at the end of previous wars: the carve-ups of Versailles in 1919, where a country that had only been narrowly defeated was treated as if it were conquered, or Potsdam in 1945, which divided Europe into west and east.Ukraine’s own peace plan –an older version of which was also leaked on Friday– tries a different tack: a full ceasefire on the current frontlines first, then a discussion about territories later. It is not the conversation that the US or Russia want to have, but Kyiv argues, with European support, that peace should be rooted in international law, not capitulation. Agreements unjustly imposed do not endure.The difficulty for Kyiv is, first, that it is the US proposing to give “de jure recognition of Russian control of Crimea” – so, a direct agreement with Russia. The second is that if Ukraine were determined to fight on, and hope that Trump would walk away, it risks losing military intelligence again – and the US may not sell Kyiv critical weapons such as Patriot air defence missiles.Russia, meanwhile, is responding with a series of increasingly aggressive punishment bombings aimed at Ukrainian civilians.Nineteen were killed when a children’s playground in Kryvyi Rih was bombedon 4 April;35 died in a morning missile attack on Palm Sunday, 13 April, in central Sumyas families promenaded into town. Three more died overnight in Pavlohrad when a drone hit an apartment block.This suggests a growing confidence that Russia will not be punished for starting a war, while Trump makes simple demands on social media for the war to stop. On Thursday,the US president said “Vladimir, STOP!”after 12 were killed by Russian bombing in Kyiv, and he complained that “5,000 soldiers a week are dying” – an exaggeration and more importantly a false equivalence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, Kyiv acknowledged the deaths of 46,000 of its own troops in mid-February, so together the total military fatality rate is less than 2,000 a week.For all the Russian aggression and the casualties it has caused, the proposed US peace terms say that while Ukraine should be compensated somehow, all sanctions on Russia going back to 2014 should be removed and Washington and Moscow should engage in “economic cooperation on energy and other industrial sectors”. So not just a carve-up, but a rapprochement that Ukraine cannot prevent.Peace discussions do more than end wars. They often set diplomatic standards for the period thereafter. Perhaps there will be last-minute changes, but the warmer tone of the US-Russia discussions compared withTrump’s beratings of Zelenskyydoes not engender much hope. Ukraine’s options – fight on and risk losing the US, or accept a formal loss of Crimea – are not attractive, even if the latter may pave the way to a ceasefire.Explore more on these topicsUkraineCrimeaRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpEuropeTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Modi is trying to assuage national anger, which has been intense.”The attackers reportedly made their victims reveal their religion by reciting the Kalma, the Islamic declaration of faith. Those who could not do so were shot dead.Pakistan and India exchange fire as UN calls for ‘maximum restraint’Read moreThe brazen assault in a tranquil meadow in Pahalgam, where families were picnicking, shattered Kashmir’s relative calm and struck at the heart of its tourist revival.In 2019, Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government revoked Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status and split the territory into two federally ruled zones. The government also allowed non-locals to buy land.An ensuing security clampdown reduced terrorist activity, and tourism surged: a record 3.5 million people visited the Kashmir Valley in 2024. Modi framed Kashmir’s “normalisation” as a political triumph, though simmering local discontent remained amid heavy militarisation.Chellaney said: “This kind of massacre is deeply embarrassing for any government, and doubly so for the Modi government, which projects itself as strong on national security.”The government must now weigh a response that balances domestic fury with strategic restraint. India andPakistanhave fought three wars – two over Kashmir – and have repeatedly come close to the brink. Underscoring the danger, Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, said on Friday there was risk of “all-out war” if India opted for a forceful military response.Chellaney said: “Modi has made strong statements in the past. But he’s a man who is reluctant to do kinetic action. He might hold back again, seeking instead to ease public anger through actions that stop short of full-scale military retaliation.”Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based analyst, said that while there was “much anger and tough rhetoric”, the government’s “actual response is likely to be careful and deliberate”. He said the government would “want to ensure any such action is well-planned and effective”.The memory of the2019 Pulwama attack, in which 40 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed in a suicide bombing claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, looms large. The episode led to India launching the Balakot airstrikes deep inside Pakistan – its first such incursion since the 1971 war. While hailed domestically as a bold move, critics disputed the effectiveness of the strikes.Veteran analyst C Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express: “There are many imponderables Modi must deal with, including the significant capabilities of the Pakistan army. But given the horrific nature of the attack and the outrage that has convulsed the nation … the PM may have no option but to explore some major risks.”India believes an obscure group calling itself the Resistance Front, which claimed responsibility for the attack, is an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Islamist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was behind the deadly2008 Mumbai attacks. Pakistan denies any involvement, but India insists it has “clear evidence of cross-border complicity” and has named two of the terrorists as Pakistani nationals.Modi has vowed to “pursue the attackers and their handlers to the ends of the Earth” and “reduce to dust whatever little land these terrorists have”.Kugelman said: “It’s crucial to separate rhetoric from intent in this emotionally charged moment.”Chellaney concurs, noting that “Modi may have a reputation for strength, but in actual practice over 11 years, he has been averse to utilising the military for any cross-border mission”.That reluctance, however, is now being tested – not just by a shaken domestic audience and anger on social media, but by unusually vocal public grief in the Kashmir Valley itself. “There have been candlelit processions. It really is unprecedented – the anger in Kashmir,” Chellaney said. Kashmiris have flooded into the streets, waving placards saying: “United in Grief.”Kugelman, meanwhile, says that India’s symbolic moves carry weight. India has suspended the 1960 Indus waters treaty – a rare symbol of bilateral cooperation that had survived previous wars. Pakistan retaliated by suspending the 1972 Simla agreement, the basis for border management and dispute resolution.That may not be enough to assuage Indian public revulsion at the attack.“The global landscape – from Gaza to Ukraine – has made previously sacrosanct territorial arrangements seem less permanent. That context may yet embolden a tougher line from Delhi, but for now, Modi is walking a tightrope between nationalist expectations and strategic prudence,” Mohan said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaKashmirPakistanNarendra ModiSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Two months later, the design – and its message supporting trans women, who are affectionately called “dolls” in the LGBTQ+ community – has become ever more popular.The singer Troye Sivan wore it to perform at Coachella, and the actor Pedro Pascal wore it for the London premiere of the film Thunderbolts, just days after the supreme court ruled that when the Equality Act referred to women,it only meant biological sexand did not include transgender women.Ives initially saw the T-shirt as a one-off statement, but demand changed that.On sale on his websitefor £75, about 5,000 orders have been placed in the last month. With proceeds going to the American organisationTrans Lifeline, as of Thursday evening Ives estimated it had raised about £380,000, with “that figure going up by the hour”.View image in fullscreenTilda Swinton wearing the T-shirt.Photograph: TwitterThe designer, an American based in London, says the T-shirt was a response to anti-trans policies put in place by Donald Trump, and in support of trans friends including the model Hunter Pifer. Even he has been surprised by how popular it is. “I never had that intention when I was doing it,” he says. “I was just like ‘this is what I want to say. This is what feels right’ and it turned into something else.”At a protest in London last weekend against the supreme court decision, the slogan was used on signs, showing it now has life beyond T-shirts. “I was discussing this with Myles [Markham], who works at Trans Lifeline,” says Ives. “He was saying they didn’t have their call to arms. He said ‘we finally have a message’.”Cliff Joannou, the editor-in-chief of Attitude magazine, says Sivan wearing the T-shirt was a crucial moment. “Any time men from the gay community stand up for the trans community, it’s a really important moment to celebrate,” he says.Nicky Josephine, who writes about trans issues for Vogue, agrees. “What is most important is the fact that it’s cis men that you’ve seen wearing it most,” she says. “They both have connections to trans women so it’s real allyship, there’s nothing performative to it.”T-shirts have, of course, long provided a device to endorse causes or make statements.

That’s where I first laid eyes on Asha. She was part of a group of new students joining my cohort. She instantly struck me as someone I wanted to be friends with. At ballet class that afternoon we shared a barre and became fast friends. Over the next couple of years things remained platonic and it wasn’t until our final year that chemistry began to build.Towards the end of that dark Melbourne winter, Asha asked if I’d work with her on some acrobatics. Every day after school we’d spend an hour or so training as a pair. There was lots of stretching and chatting, trying and failing various tricks and lots of laughs. It wasn’t long before I realised I was seriously enjoying these sessions, and not just in a professional or friendly way. I was falling in love.View image in fullscreenL-R: Tristan holds another performer during a Circa show; Asha Colless in a routine with hoops.Composite: Milissa Martin/Stuart HendrieAs our skills developed, we moved on to trickier tricks. At one session we were trying to figure out as many different ways to climb to shoulders as we could. I’m a fair bit bigger than Asha and I wasn’t in the habit of getting on others’ shoulders. But the session was so joyful and relaxed, I realised it didn’t matter if we got it wrong, we were having just as much fun laughing it off and giving it another go.In the end we pulled it off. Her ability to bear my weight was so impressive. But I knew at that moment it ran deeper than that – that our ability to support each other wasn’t just physical.I had never felt as close to anyone as I did to Asha – we were completely on the same wavelength about so many things in and out of the circus. When I brought all this up a few days after that session it quickly became apparent the feeling was mutual.The moment I knew: he bared his soul in a performance and I fell for his sensitive sideRead moreBy springtime we were official, and not long after that Asha signed her contract with Australian circus group Circa. During the last term she went away to do a one-week show with them and I missed her so badly that my already strong ambition to join Circa felt like a non-negotiable.I was accepted and within weeks of our graduation at the end of 2023 we were there together. But a cruel twist in casting meant we were separated for over six months.We were reunited mid last year and have been in each other’s pockets since. I find touring life really tough, but doing it with Asha makes it so much better. I know we can rely on each other. She can stand on my shoulders when she needs to, and I can stand on hers too – literally and figuratively. And if we take a tumble, I know we can laugh together and try again.Tristan and Asha are performing together in, Humans 2.0at Arts Centre Melbourne from 14 to 24 MayTell us the moment you knewShare your experienceDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

Where else can one experience the full gamut of human depravity – from farting on the treadmill to taking conference calls on the cross trainer? And that’s before we get to “gymtimidation.” Arecent surveyfound that one in four people feel self-conscious at the gym, while 28% worry about using the equipment incorrectly (and, God forbid, suffering the ultimate indignity of starring in a viral “gym fail” video).But how to ensure you are the hero of your own fitness journey, and not the person other gym-goers have nicknamed “grunt”? We consulted the experts.Can I film myself?Gymfluencers filming content (and getting annoyed when someone walks into their shot) is a relatively new, and often unwelcome, phenomenon. “I really hate this,” saysNick Finney, a personal trainer who has worked with Robbie Williams and Jennifer Lopez. “There are legit reasons to film yourself – for instance, if you want to check your form or send a video to an online trainer to show them how you’re doing something. But setting up a tripod in a busy gym, so you can record fitness content for TikTok, risks upsetting people who are already nervous about being there, and won’t want to be on camera.”And if you have your heart set on becoming a pound shop Joe Wicks? “Set up in a quiet area of the gym where there aren’t loads of people in shot. If someone close by is likely to be filmed, then it’s polite to ask them before pressing record.” As for taking umbrage if someone inadvertently ruins your shot, according toJosh Davies, a co-founder of OMNI Wellness and head trainer at Aimee Victoria Long: “If you do choose to film in the gym, that is your prerogative, but it’s not other people’s responsibility to stay out of your shot. If someone needs to get to some equipment and you’re in the way, that’s your problem, not theirs.”Should I offer unsolicited advice on ‘form’?“Unless someone is in immediate, life-threatening danger – not just at risk of a potential injury in the future – then my answer is no,” saysShona Vertue, a yoga teacher and personal trainer, whose clients include David Beckham. “For many people, training at the gym can make them feel incredibly vulnerable, and the last thing they need is someone pointing out what they might be doing wrong.”Davies cautions that women can be particularly wary of “gym bros”, and warns against mansplaining. “Offering advice to someone of your own gender is less likely to cause offence,” he says.According to Finney: “Even as a personal trainer, I find this tricky – people are sensitive, so unsolicited advice often doesn’t go down well. I mostly leave people who aren’t my clients to it, and step in at the point that someone is putting themselves at risk of injury. If someone is doing a dodgy deadlift, I’ll gently suggest an adjustment to spare them from a slipped disk. However, if you disagree with someone’s tricep form, keep it to yourself – once you start correcting everyone, you’ll be there all day. If you are going to suggest something, acknowledge that they haven’t asked for your advice, and back off as soon as you feel your opinion isn’t welcome.”How about asking someone tospot meif I’m doing a heavy lift?“That’s absolutely fine,” says Davies. “Just try to ask someone who could safely handle the weight if you’re struggling. There’s no point asking someone who weighs 50kg to spot you while you try to lift 80kg.”Is it OK to speak on the phone?“No,” says Davies. “There’s one guy in my gym who walks around talking really loudly about his business deals, and it’s super-annoying. People are there to work hard, improve themselves and forget about whatever else is going on in their lives – they don’t want to have to listen to your conversations.”As Finney explains: “The danger with chatting away on the phone is that you become unaware of your surroundings, and someone gets hurt.” But, he adds: “It’s fine to send a quick WhatsApp or change your music during a rest period.”View image in fullscreenIllustration: Edith Pritchett/The GuardianIs it ever OK to arrive late to a class – or to leave early?“Every studio or gym is different and has differing rules around lateness,” says Vertue. “If it’s in the middle of a yoga meditation then it’s not ideal. If it’s a fitness session, it may not disrupt people, but could be dangerous if you’ve missed out on the exercise demonstrations or warm up.”According to Finney, “If you don’t have time to do a full class, then you don’t have time. It’s never OK to turn up very late or leave early.” Vertue agrees that “leaving early is where it gets more disrespectful. If you’ve set aside the time to take part in a class, stay for the whole session, unless of course you aren’t feeling well. In which case, let the instructor know before you leave.”Can I take weights off a squat rack that’s in use?“Racks and benches basically function as storage units for free weights, and by using one you don’t automatically own all the weights on it,” says Finney.However, adds Davies: “You should always ask before taking a plate from someone else’s machine, in case they were planning to use it. Just don’t ask them mid-exercise. If someone is halfway through a squat and they have to turn their neck to speak, that can take their spine out of alignment and cause a whole host of issues. Always wait until someone has finished a set before interrupting.”What counts as hogging equipment?“Sometimes people need to spend time on a machine,” says Finney. “For instance, I have a dodgy knee and it takes me a while to get warmed up on a leg press. Some people do German volume training, which requires 10 sets of 10 reps. That might take 20 minutes or half an hour. The main aggravation comes when people take long rest periods, so are monopolising a piece of equipment without even being active on it. If someone is eager to get on a machine, don’t sit on it looking at your phone or take six minutes of rest between sets.”According to Vertue: “People lifting very heavy weights often need extended breaks to allow their nervous system to recover before the next set. This is particularly common with heavy compound exercises such as bench presses, squats, deadlifts, hip thrusts and sometimes leg presses.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs for super sets – alternating between two sets of equipment with no rest in between? “Read the room,” advises Finney. “They’re fine if the gym is quiet, but don’t hog two machines if the gym is busy. It’s fine to suggest sharing equipment so that someone else can use it during your rest period and vice versa.”Is it ever OK to flirt/ask someone on a date?“I’d err on the side of no,” suggests Davies. “There’s nothing wrong with chatting and having friendships in the gym, but most people are there to work and it’s not appropriate to flirt.” Vertue is more sanguine: “Not everyone will agree with me, but many people prefer meeting potential partners in person rather than on dating apps, and the gym can be a fantastic setting for this. Especially because they attract people who prioritise their health – a quality I personally value in a partner.”Still, she recommends a gradual approach. “Maybe suggest a quick post-workout shake date to gauge compatibility. It can be less daunting than meeting a stranger from an app.” Finney agrees: “I certainly wouldn’t go in cold and tell someone you fancy them in the middle of a workout.” And if you do face unwanted attention? “If anyone makes you uncomfortable, report it to the staff immediately,” says Vertue.In a group class, where should I position myself?“Front and centre,” says Vertue. “Although sometimes daunting, it is a great place to be because you can see the teacher and you aren’t distracted by others. “But anywhere is fine, provided you can see and access the instructor if need be.”Finney adds: “I have clients who don’t like to see themselves exercising, so choose to avoid the mirror. Stand wherever you’re most comfortable.”Is training shirtless allowed if I want to see my pump? And how about shoeless?‘Plot twist - I’m still a fat person!’: meet the people proving you can be fit at any sizeRead more“There are two considerations here,” says Finney. “A lot of people find training topless inappropriate and won’t want to see your naked body. It also risks getting sweat on the equipment. That’s in a public gym. At places like Hyrox and CrossFit, being topless is more part of the culture, because it’s a closed group and people are mostly standing and using barbells rather than sitting on equipment.” If in doubt, “keep your ‘pump checks’ confined to the changing room,” says Vertue. Training shoeless is less controversial. According to Davies: “You might not want to wear the same shoes running on a treadmill as squatting (running trainers are cushioned to help with the impact of running, whereas you need a flat sole to lift, to ensure even weight distribution). If you don’t want to pack two pairs of trainers, lifting shoeless is fine.” However, shoeless doesn’t mean barefoot. “As a trainer, I might need to see what’s happening with someone’s arches or toes,” says Finney. “But I draw the line at taking your socks off.”How much noise is OK?“Making a noise can help people lift heavier weights, by supporting intra-abdominal pressure,” says Vertue, “but we’re talking about very, very heavy lifts. Ask yourself: Are you grunting because it genuinely helps, or is it to draw attention from others? If it’s the latter, it’s likely to have the opposite impact of what you’re aiming for.”Finney agrees: “You should be able to make some noise, especially during exercises requiring valsalva manoeuvre [a forced exhalation which helps power heavy lifts], but how much is contextual – a CrossFit gym is very different from a boutique hotel gym, where people won’t appreciate you screaming.”When it comes to dropping weights at the end of the set, Davies says, it depends on the type of gym and the equipment. “Places like CrossFit, or gyms that do Olympic lifting, have specialist floors and rubber plates that are designed to be dropped – because if you’re doing a one-rep max deadlift then you don’t want to have to think about putting the weight back down. In a commercial gym, dropping weights risks damaging the barbell, or the floor, as well as being a distracting noise to those around you.”Do I need to wipe down equipment?On this, the trainers are unequivocal. “Always, no exceptions,” says Finney. “Even if you aren’t sweaty,” adds Davies. “It’s nicer for the next person.”Explore more on these topicsFitnessHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Largely funded by the sale of Coppola’s own vineyards, the sci-fi epic starring Adam Driver took around $14m at the global box office amid unconvinced reviews and rumours of abnormal on-set behaviour by its director.A marketing campaign attempted to leverage bad critical notices by flagging that previous works by Coppola now acclaimed as masterpieces – including Apocalypse Now and The Godfather – had been dismissed by critics at the time. But this backfired after it emerged all of the sniffy historical reviews had been fabricated.The film failed to earn the attention of awards bodies other than the Golden Raspberries for bad movies, which voted the film both worst director and worst supporting actor (for Jon Voight).Now, a new attempt to ensure the legacy of what may be the 86-year-old director’s final film has been announced: a comic book re-interpretation by Chris Ryall, titled Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis: An Original Graphic Novel.In a statement on Thursday, Coppola explained that the book would not simply be a re-rendering of his film. “I was pleased to put the idea of a graphic novel in the competent hands of Chris Ryall with the idea that, although it was inspired by my film Megalopolis, it didn’t necessarily have to be limited by it,” he said.“I hoped the graphic novel would take its own flight, with its own artists and writer so that it would be a sibling of the film, rather than just an echo. That’s what I feel Chris, Jacob Phillips and the team at Abrams ComicArts have accomplished. It confirms my feeling thatartcan never be constrained, but rather always a parallel expression, and part of the bounty we can make available to our patrons, audiences and readers.”Said Ryall: “Coppola’s storytelling challenged and inspired me at every turn,” adding that he hoped he had “created something that both honours and expands the world of the original film.”Although graphic novels are often used as source material for film, in particular for superhero movies, the reverse is considerably more unusual.Explore more on these topicsFrancis Ford  CoppolaMegalopolisComics and graphic novelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Or when it emerged that a freshLord of the Ringssaga was, through some kind of Gandalfian wizardry, being squeezed on to the small screen, the reaction was one of giddy awe. Even the faintest whisper of another trip to Hogwarts would have set the whole internet ablaze. And now? Well, here’s a test: there’s a new Harry Potter series coming out soon. How does that make you feel? Exactly.There’s no doubt about it – a worrying number of what used to be the world’s most untouchable franchises are in trouble. But how did they arrive at this point of terminal audience ennui? And is there any route for them back into our hearts?Harry PotterView image in fullscreenThe OGs … (from left) Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThe problem:even more Potter? You cannot be SiriusSince HBO announced its new, apparently very exciting and definitely necessary adaptation of JK Rowling’s books,starring John Lithgow as Dumbledore, Paapa Essiedu as Snape and Nick Frost as Hagrid, reaction has been more muted than they were perhaps hoping. Despite that excellent cast, and even putting aside the author’s own personal journey from Hufflepuff to Slytherin, it isn’t hard to see why. Since the film series ended in 2011, we’ve had three Fantastic Beasts movies, a perennial stage play, more video games than you can waggle a Horcrux at and, for reasons no one adequately explained, a baking show. The boy who lived is still everywhere – there’s probably one of the films on ITV2 right now, go and check. See? Told you. If there is to be a tipping point that sends the already wobbly house of cards toppling over for good, a pointless TV reboot feels as though it could be it.The solution: a transmogrify spell!To justify its own existence, Potter the series needs to be recklessly brave, utterly unrecognisable from what came before – a departure of such magnitude that the movies are thereafter considered a quaint trial run from a more innocent age. Imagine a full-blown supernatural horror, blood and guts and swearing and all, set in the scariest haunted house imaginable: a creepy old school in which Dick Solomon from 3rd Rock from the Sun has a distressingly large beard. Every episode should be directed by a different horror auteur – Mike Flanagan, Coralie Fargeat, Osgood Perkins. Children may be traumatised; this could prove to be a costly failure. But imagine if it wasn’t.Imagine it.Star WarsView image in fullscreenSaber rattling … Rosario Dawson in Ahsoka.Photograph: Lucasfilm LtdThe problem:it finds your lack of faith disturbingAfter Disney splashed $4.05bn (£2.5bn) on the brand in 2012, it was clear that it would need to milk that cash cow for every last drop. And lo, after five rushed-out movies came a slew of TV shows:The Mandalorian,The Book of Boba Fett,Obi-Wan Kenobi,Andor,Ahsoka,The Acolyte,Skeleton Crew– and those were just the live-action ones. If you were a card-carrying Star Wars nerd, this was fantastic. You had a deep understanding of what was going on in each show. But casual viewers – somehow expected to know and care that Rosario Dawson was Darth Vader’s old apprentice in Ahsoka, for instance – were left baffled. Shockingly, catering exclusively to the diehards ended up putting a lot of people off. The Acolyte was swiftly cancelled amid an unedifying if sadly predictable flurry of racism and misogyny directed at its lead, Amandla Stenberg; then Skeleton Crew, despite essentially being Space Goonies with Jude Law as Sloth, debuted toeven worse ratingsthan that. Beyond Andor’s second and final season, which if it’s even half as good as the first will still be essential viewing, everyone’s got a very bad feeling about this.The solution: go far, far awayEven Star Wars’s biggest devotees must admit that the brand needs to be rested. And when it comes back, it cannot continue to demand that audiences have a PhD in advanced convention attendance to understand who everybody is, where they are, what they’re doing and why. People have jobs, other interests, families. Disney needs to operate a strict policy of one show at a time, and pour every resource into it; a new, accessible, unmissable story. No more prequels. No more reliance on exclusionary, esoteric lore. Make something good and people will come: Band of Brothers in space; Natasha Lyonne as a wisecracking podracer; Breaking Bad but with strung-out Ewoks – it really isn’t that hard.The Lord of the RingsView image in fullscreenBored of the rings … Owain Arthur and Sophia Nomvete in The Rings of Power.Photograph: Prime VideoThe problem:it’s as dull as Bilbo’s butter knifeWhen the prequel to The Lord of the Rings,The Rings of Power, debuted in 2022, opinion was divided between “spectacular, wow, just wow” and “so dull it made all my children cry”. Both opinions were correct. None of this was helped by top-o’-the-morning accents that were somehow equally offensive to hobbits and the Irish, and the unavoidable influence of “prequelitis”, the tension-robbing knowledge of who lives and who dies – so really, who cares what happens? Last year’s comparatively spry, action-packed second season, with nary a culturally insensitive harfoot in sight, was an improvement, but by then the damage was done: reports put the drop-off in viewership between the first and second seasons at an eye-watering60%. At a cost of £50m an episode, this isn’t a trend even Amazon can sustain for long. Something has to give.The solution: reforge the Rings of PowerPlenty of shows, from The Office to Parks and Recreation, went on to thrive after a duff first season. They did, however, hit the ground running in season two in a way The Rings of Power didn’t, making the hill it needs to climb that much steeper. What’s required here is something more drastic: a soft reboot. Keep the cast, characters and broad narrative of The Rings of Power, but change the name to something cool – The War of the Rings? – and pitch the third season as a new(ish) tale that requires no prior knowledge. Thrust newcomers headlong into the battle between good and evil The Rings of Power has been languidly leading up to. Sauron’s bad. Gandalf’s good. People will pick that up. Treat The Rings of Power as an optional prequel, make this “new” show propulsive and addictive, and boom: you’ve got the world’s first $1bn sleeper hit on your hands.Stranger ThingsView image in fullscreenInferno … Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixThe problem: my, how you’ve grownThe final season of the Duffer Brothers’adolescent-culling megasmasharrives this autumn, and every sentient being in the observable universe is going to watch it, so this is hardly a franchise on the ropes in terms of popularity. But its legacy? That is on far shakier ground. Each successive series has been bigger, more ambitious, more outlandish than the last, culminating in season four’s crop of bumper-length episodes (the finale was a bum-numbing two-and-a-half hours). It was loud and exciting but bloated, confusing, not remotely scary, and so far removed from the focused Spielbergian chills of the first season that, side by side, they are completely different shows. For all its fireworks, and beyond the unexpected Kate Bush renaissance and the death of a certain Metallica-loving perm enthusiast,season fourwas a flabby, wayward mess. Season five has been described by star Maya Hawke as “basically eight movies”. Oh dear.The solution: flip everything back upside-downThe only way to guarantee the show bows out on a high is for it to return to where it all began: a back-to-basics horror story akin to season one – the tight, intimate spooks that got everyone hooked in the first place. If it is indeed “eight movies”, make them eight suburban horror tales, scarier and nastier than they have any real reason to be. Let us look back onStranger Thingsas it was – the scrappy, retro creep-em-up that conquered the planet, not the overblown apocalyptic epic it swelled into. More importantly, and for the love of God, please give Barb the long-overdue justice she deserves.MarvelView image in fullscreenIs she even canon? … Tatiana Maslany in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.Photograph: APThe problem: no one has the faintest clue what’shappeningWhich multiverse is the correct one? Is it the one we’re in right now? Or is this another dream/simulation? What phase even is it? Post-Endgame? Pre? Wait, who’s that? Oh, it’s wossname, that one there, your fella, with the shiny hat,Loki… no wait … is it? … Captain America …? … No, that’s … isShe-Hulkeven canon, or is it like Deadpool? … tired … confused … everyone’s so very, very confused …The solution: a click of the fingersArbitrarily cancel 50% of all in-development Marvel shows. Then bring back the brilliantJessica Jones, you cowards. Done. Next.Star TrekView image in fullscreenLive long and prosper! … Ethan Peck as Spock in Strange New Worlds.Photograph: TCD/AlamyThe problem: against cancellation, resistance is futileTrek’s faithful have faced some choppy, erm, space over the past eight years. They’ve hadStar Trek: Discovery(good, then so-so, then cancelled), Strange New Worlds (good, then better, not yet cancelled),Lower Decks(great, cancelled), Prodigy (great, cancelled),Picard(so-so, cringe, excellent, a dignified exit) and the recent TV movie,Section 31(like watching the smell of sick). In addition to the lone survivor, Strange New Worlds, there is the upcoming, Holly Hunter-starring Starfleet Academy (TBD). Based on what’s gone before, you wouldn’t bet on either of them lasting long.The solution: to boldly go where Trek has been before – Netflix and Prime VideoModern Trek shows are big, shiny, expensive things. Such endeavours clearly need to cast their net as widely as possible, and the relatively niche Paramount+ simply is not an environment in which they can do that. All those cancelled shows, even the animated Prodigy and Lower Decks, were scuttled because their audiences simply weren’t solid enough to warrant their production costs. Discovery was more than £6m an episode. But Picard debuted on Prime Video. Discovery was on Netflix before ViacomCBS, now Paramount Global,bought back the rightsin 2021. Prodigy is on Netflix right now. This isn’t a massive stretch. In order for Trek to live long and prosper, Paramount has to suck it up, sign another co-production deal with one of these, and get Trek beamed back into as many living rooms as possible. Only then might it Klingon (so very, very sorry).Game of ThronesView image in fullscreenOnce upon a time … Emma D’Arcy as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen in House of the Dragon.Photograph: Ollie Upton/HBO/PAThe problem:Westeros? More like WesterozzzzzzNo need for a spoiler alert regarding the events of season two of Thrones spin-offHouse of the Dragon, because there weren’t any. A family, all of whom have identical hair and the same name, talk about having a war with another family, all of whom have identical hair and the same name. A dragon commits fratricide. Matt Smith has some dreams in a bed. That’s it. The show has now spent 18 episodes apparently leading up to something thrilling, but if you were asked to name five gobsmacking moments, could you really say yes?The solution: reclaim the water coolerThe original Thrones was essential appointment TV the likes of which we may never see again; something you couldn’t wait to talk to someone –anyone, friend, stranger, foe, alarmed man at bus stop – about. The Red Wedding blew minds. Spoilers ended lifelong friendships. People held viewing parties for season finales, and named their kids after characters who went on to have sex with blood relatives, or become mass-murdering maniacs, or both.House of the Dragonis a decent fantasy drama, nothing more. It’s too far gone to turn things round on its own. There’s another spin-off due later this year – A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms – and it’s this that bears the weight of the entire Thrones brand on its shoulders. If it can somehow rebottle the lightning that made the series a global smash – Betrayals! Twists! Deaths! Surprises!Things actually happening!– it could restoke the fire in the bellies of millions of lapsed Westeros obsessives. It is, however, based on a series of novellas called Tales of Dunk and Egg. Things aren’t looking all that promising, to be honest.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStar Trek (Culture)Game of ThronesHouse of the DragonHarry PotterStar Trek (Film)Stranger ThingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After a winter of wool andheavy boots, the time is ripe for shaking up your look with a warm(er) weather update.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That doesn’t mean buying a whole new wardrobe: one of the things I enjoy about getting older is developing a wardrobe for each season that comes back year on year. Put clothes away between seasons: some items that make their way back out of storage were everyday favourites before then, while others may not have felt right for some time but now – lucky for you – they feel right once again. There’s something extra-fun about falling back in love with something from your own wardrobe.Having said that, the odd update can be a welcome thing in a wardrobe needing to cope afresh with sun, showers and occasions such as weddings and holidays. Now’s the time to do a wardrobe audit, think carefully about what you need and what you don’t, and let this guide inspire you to fill any gaps, thoughtfully.A jacketView image in fullscreenRainbow gingham jacket£135 at Boden£135 at John LewisBoden isn’t a brand I naturally recommend, but this jacket is an instant spring wardrobe shaker-upper. Fun, a versatile fit and a massive shot of sartorial caffeine. What’s not to make you smile.A dressView image in fullscreenPolka dot midaxi cami dress£45 at Marks & SpencerVery much in the vein of the polka dot dress Julia Roberts famously wore in Pretty Woman, this frock from M&S stands out. Team it with your old denim jacket if the weather’s still patchy, or a blazer if you want to smarten up the look. It’s 100% cotton and available in regular, petite or tall lengths, and it will fill a hole in several wardrobes. It will also signal you know what’s currently filling column inches in Vogue: the polka dot, while also a timeless classic, is pinging back this spring. If that one doesn’t float your boat, M&S is currently a trove of other similarly affordable polka dot styles which just might (such as this one).A bagView image in fullscreenGhanaian basket bag£75 at AarvenA different season calls for a different bag. Those heavy leather bags of winter start to feel OTT come spring, and lighter materials feel more in keeping. You may have an old wicker basket from warm seasons past to pull out. If not, this handcrafted basket bag, made out of the veta vera plant in northern Ghana, is a great option. Big enough to carry pints of milk back from the shop and available in a few different colours, it will also make a nice storage basket in the colder months. Or, basket bags are two-a-penny on Etsy, fromclassic, understated woven straw basketswith leather handles tosisal shoppersandwicker totes. Just search “basket bag” and make sure your results are filtered so you’re looking only at ones that dispatch from the UK. Dress them up or down and wear them to the office or the beach.A pair of bright socksView image in fullscreenFuchsia socks£9.28 at Le Bon Shoppe£10 at Free PeopleThis time of year offers a chance to have fun playing around with colour via sock and shoe combinations. Spring shoes offer up more room for socks to speak, so pick a pair with something to say, like this bright pink cotton-blend pair from Le Bon Shoppe, pedlars of good-quality socks. If pink isn’t your bag, there’s a range of Keith Haring-style brights (turquoise! tangerine!) as well as more understated shades (avocado, dijon and dried rose, for instance) to choose from. Since it’s an LA brand, though, you might be limited toseeing which colours UK stockists currently have to offer.A waistcoatView image in fullscreenPolka dot Martina jacket£145 at Octobre£145 at SézaneThe waistcoat – once relegated to snooker players, stockbrokers and wedding guests – shows no signs of slowing its steady march back to mainstream popularity. This sleeveless jacket from the French brand Sézane has the energy of a waistcoat, but for people who don’t want to go the whole hog. The cinched-in waist is a nice touch, but the belt’s removable if you’d rather have it a little less sculpted. Yet more polka dots!SandalsView image in fullscreenButter yellow women’s sandal£74.95 at Salt-Water£74.95 at Flip Flop ShopButter yellow, we are told, is the colour of spring 2025. While I’ve always been a fan of its creamy goodness, it can be a tricky colour to wear. One easy way in is via feet, and Saltwater’s new butter yellow sandals give the brand’s original style a sunny update. If the actual sun still isn’t complying, I wouldn’t be afraid to team this sandal – or any sandal – with a sock. A sidenote: brilliantly, the Missouri-born company also offers a takeback scheme for UK customers. So if you have old Salt-Waters no longer in rotation (although this may take a while – mine have been going for more than five years and counting), they needn’t end up in landfill. (Vintedis also rich withunworn or lightly worn Salt-Waters.)ShortsView image in fullscreenTowelling shorts£65 at Me + EmWhile there’s a risk you’ll be wearing the same shorts as some MPs, this pair from the Labour-approved brand Me+Em is the perfect foundation for warmer-weather outfits. Towelling is a popular warm-weather fabric – visitThe Design Museum’s latest exhibition, Splash!to delve into its long history in swimming and holiday style – and for good reason. Soft and practical, this pair of mid-weight cotton-blend towelling shorts is perfect for a barbecue, beach sit or damp bench in a pub beer garden. Depending on the weather, you may still need a chunky jumper on top, but at least your legs can get in the holiday spirit.PyjamasView image in fullscreenBlue floral pyjamas£55 at Cloth HouseIt’s time to put those heavy flannel pyjamas in storage and usher back some old lighter, cotton nightwear into your life – or welcome in some new ones. This set from fabric institution The Cloth House is delightful, and made of block-printed cotton from India. As if a good night’s sleep could feel any more idyllic.Co-ordsView image in fullscreenRed linen-blend top£47 at Nobody’s Child£47 at Marks & SpencerView image in fullscreenRed linen-blend trousers£65 at Nobody’s Child£65 at Marks & SpencerIf you’re yet to hop on the co-ord bandwagon that’s made the past few summers more matchy-matchy than usual, then perhaps the time is now. A less intimidating gateway is to pick a single block colour and wear it head to toe, rather than going for a kitsch print or bold pattern worn on top and bottom. This matching tomato-red linen-blend top and trousers from Nobody’s Child is coordination without any naffness. A great way to add vine freshness to your wardrobe.A shirtView image in fullscreenBlue and navy boyfriend shirt£110 at With Nothing UnderneathUnless it’s a white shirt – in which case, sadly, you’d be foolish not to buy new – secondhand sites are abundant with beautiful-quality shirts that are perfect for a spring wardrobe facelift. With Nothing Underneath is a brand worn by the former British “first lady” Akshata Murty, but don’t let that put you off. The Boyfriend shirt is a stone-cold classic: a linen and cotton blend, the stripes feel preppy and it’s regularly available on secondhand sites – Vinted is awash with them for much less than new (this onelooks pleasingly preppy and is in good nick).Teklais another brand to keep an eye on – super-expensive first-hand, but its pyjamas make for lovely shirts and can be found secondhand for much cheaper (see herefor a nice example, in a yolky shade; it is made out of crisp poplin).A wedding-guest dressView image in fullscreenColour block pleated midi dress£259 at John LewisThere’s no shame in rewearing an outfit to multiple weddings – in fact, the opposite. However, if you do need to refresh your wedding-guest look, this dress is sure to blow sartorial cobwebs away. The work of a popular recent collaboration between John Lewis and the British label A.W.A.K.E. Mode, it’s a beautifully bold rebuke to all those years of quiet luxury. Best worn for many years to come – and luckily the fit should mean it needs only very occasional (eco) dry cleaning.SunglassesView image in fullscreenPurple sunglasses£40 at Lentiamo£40 at IzipiziIzipizi is becoming a sunglasses overlord – I have, on more than one occasion, turned up matching the sunnies of at least two other people in the room. However, all it means is that these are great sunnies at a reasonable price – why wouldn’t people want them? This fun purple pair adds a fizz of colour to your spring wardrobe. The classic shape means they’ll continue to fizz for many years to come, too. (Again, secondhand sites are replete.)An unexpected trenchcoatView image in fullscreenCape trench£199 at John Lewis£199 at AlbarayWhether you’ve been wearing the same trench for years or have always found them too bland, you may find something to enjoy fromthis year’s glut of unexpected, wonky trenchcoats, made interesting in different directions, from colour to pattern to cut. I like this khaki organic cotton cape trench from the ethically minded brand Albaray, which offers optional drama via its detachable cape.A box-fresh white T-shirt or vestView image in fullscreenVintage organic T-shirt£14.90 at Plain and SimpleSpring always has me wanting to dress like James Dean, in blue denim and a fresh white tee or tank. Plain and Simple makes excellent-quality examples of both, using ethical practices and materials. It also has a takeback scheme for your past-it T-shirts, so you can return them for free to be recycled or composted. No cause to rebel here.A trusty cardiganView image in fullscreenFloral knit cardigan£145 at KitriCardigans are a sensible choice in spring. The weather is volatile and layers are a must. That doesn’t mean they have to be boring, though. This floral-knit Kitri cardy is fun, but will also keep you warm when the weather isn’t playing ball. The naive tulip jacquard motif is cute while remaining just the ride side of coquettecore.A refreshing necklaceView image in fullscreenFish pendant lapis lazuli£155 at Blooming DreamerAccessories can do a lot of heavy lifting to refresh an old, much-worn look. Blooming Dreamer makes necklaces that look like the kind of thing you wore when you were 13, but elevated: excellent quality and built to last, rather than to cast off as quickly as your teenage holiday crush. Handmade in the UK and carved from lapis lazuli, this fish with a lemon silk cord will look just as great over a jumper as with a summer dress.A statement bangleView image in fullscreenYellow bangle£34.99 at PilgrimAnd with the prompt pizzaz of a good piece of jewellery in mind, a chunky resin bangle is also great shout for an instant update. A punchy detail that will make even a James Dean-style jeans and T-shirt combination feel thoughtful and fit for work. These ones from purveyors of Scandi-style jewellery Pilgrim will look great either on their own or stacked like enormous calamari rings up your arm.Built-to-last ballet shoesView image in fullscreenGreen leather moccasins£100 at Camper£114.56 at EsdemarcaBallet shoes continue to plié through our warmer months. However, so many are flimsy, uncomfortable and quick-to-tire and therefore a waste of money. This leather pair from Camper is not. Supple and soft, they feel kind to your feet even as you approach the 10,000th of your daily steps.A cap with a messageView image in fullscreenSorry i’m late! cap£25 at EverpressBaseball caps have always been a classic, but in the past few years they’ve reached even headier heights of popularity. And with good reason – they’re practical, particularly in the sunnier months, and can help you out on a day when you would rather fly under the radar. They’re also a great place to send a message, and Everpress, an online retailer that allows individuals to upload designs and sell stock on a made-to-order basis, has a message for most occasions – “sorry I’m late” would help me out on most days. I can also see the merits ofthis one.A monochrome jacketView image in fullscreenTweed checked fringed jacket£69 at Marks & SpencerThis Chanel-style bouclé jacket is a bargain in comparison to the real thing, and it’s perfect for that in-between spring weather, when it’s too warm for a big coat but too chilly to go without a warmer layer.For more,check out our guide to high-street Chanel-style jacketsGen-Z jeansView image in fullscreenWide palazzo leg jeans£45 at Marks & SpencerGen Z ushered in anew era of baggy jeansand it looks as if they’re here to stay. If you still haven’t made the shift, this palazzo style with a flattering high waist would be a great pair to take the plunge with.A boho blouseView image in fullscreenCheesecloth blouse£75 at Me+EmThis peach blouse is simple enough to be a spring staple, but its ruffled details elevate it to a statement piece.In her column, Jess Cartner-Morley says it’s great for layering as the collar “adds a pop of interest poking out under a crew-neck knit”.Barrel-leg trousersView image in fullscreenJersey barrel-leg trousers£34.90 at UniqloUniqlo’s viral barrel-leg trousers are a dreamy combo of casual enough for every day and smart enough for the office. And the neutral colours (off-white, olive and navy) make the potential outfit combinations endless.A bright pouchView image in fullscreenCross-body leather phone bag£25 at EtsyThese handy little bags will add a playful pop of colour to your outfit. They’re ideal for when you only need to take your phone and keys out with you.Shiny shoesView image in fullscreenMary Jane ballet shoes£12.50 at AsdaSilver is great because it goes with everything, and it adds more pizazz to an outfit than black or white. These metallic flats are the pilates pump style revered byJess Cartner-Morleyand are incredibly affordable.A dependable raincoatView image in fullscreenRains long jacket£76 at John Lewis£95 at RainsA dependable raincoat is a necessity throughout spring and, let’s face it, summer. Yet finding a raincoat that’s reliable and attractive can be tricky. This one from Rains strikes the right balance, with a classic style that would pair well with most outfits.For more, check outour guide to the best raincoatsA sweatshirtView image in fullscreenEnid embroidered jumper£84 at John Lewis£84 at BodenHave you noticed cherries are everywhere at the moment?

But she went all in anyway. “I wanted to be fully committed to it. I never really thought about it as doing a side hustle.”Zhang Ferron signed up for a three-month course with Makers Academy, the training scheme that promises to help “the best people in Britain pivot into tech” as she felt that this would give her the skills, contacts and the necessary understanding to build a digital business – even if she was going to bring in more experienced tech experts later.She then began approaching people she knew who might want to sell expensive pieces of furniture they no longer wanted. “It was a big flop,” she admits.After a rethink, she began trying to persuade London furniture dealers to list on her site, tempting them with exceptionally good terms with the aim of finding 200 must-have products to launch with.Having realised that most of the dealers were small businesses who didn’t have the time, knowledge or interest to list things online, she offered to create posts for them for little or even no cost. A dozen signed up initially.The site’s first sale in January 2016 was a pair of Belgian mid-century armchairs. It quickly became apparent that Zhang Ferron was not the only one looking for an easier way to buy vintage furniture. By the following year the site had hit £1m in sales and annual sales via the site hit more than £16.5m in the last year – up 15% in a tough market.Vinterior now has just over half a million pieces listed on it, the vast majority of which come from 2,600 professional dealers and the rest from design-conscious individuals or sellers.More than 100,000 customers are signed up after the company invested in its first TV ads and it has gradually extended its ranges beyond the trend for mid-century classics to Victoriana and art deco, among others.Vinterior had a bit of luck securing half a million of extra funding from its investors in February 2020 – just before the Covid pandemic hit the UK.That cash was good to have in the back pocket as shoppers locked away their wallets during the first weeks of lockdown as they battled the challenges of a pandemic.“The first few weeks of Covid were so scary. Nothing happened.”It was particularly tough for Zhang Ferron as she was about to go on maternity leave. But the team conserved limited cash, working part-time or taking furlough, and then sales started to take off.View image in fullscreenSandrine Zhang Ferron, the boss of Vinterior, created the site for herself.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianAs physical shops across the country were forced to close for several months, and the manufacturing and deliveries of many large items such as furniture were blocked, secondhand goods that could be sourced online – and delivered quickly rather than being stuck on a container ship – were in demand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It doesn’t feel like it is cheap.”That rise in demand came with its own challenges. Like many other online specialists, Vinterior believed the pandemic had kicked off a complete change in consumer behaviour and shoppers would not return to physical shops in quite the same way.When the inevitable pause in growth came as the pandemic subsided, Zhang Ferron realised the company had “made some bad decisions” but it was lucky that it had been careful about spending.There was some painful adjustment in the wider market, with the online furniture sellerMade.comand others collapsing, but Vinterior continued to expand after a brief lull, despite wider problems in furniture retail amid a lacklustre housing market and a squeeze on disposable income.Sales are set to rise by a fifth this year.The uncertain geopolitical environment could be a challenge as shoppers rein in spending. However, Zhang Ferron says Donald Trump’s tariff war is not necessarily all bad news.“We could see this shift making our platform even more attractive to premium UK and EU dealers who currently sell a lot to US customers and may now seek to diversify due to increased barriers,” she says.To many of Zhang Ferron’s customers, finding the right piece is an emotional more than a financial call and they still feel they are making savings despite some eye-watering prices. Paying more than £2,000 for a sought-after Ligne Roset Togo sofa on Vinterior can still be more than a third cheaper than a new one and it can be delivered right away.She argues that vintage pieces can also hold their value more than new items – something that buyers take into account.Zhang Ferron can also attest to years of enjoyment. “The yellow Poul Volther chair that sparked the idea for Vinterior is still one of my most treasured pieces,” she says. And that sceptical former colleague? His wife apparently refurnished their home with pieces from Vinterior.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryInteriorsHomesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Laid bare in his handling of that issue are not only his myriad weaknesses, but also the danger he poses to his own country and the wider world – to say nothing of the battered people of Ukraine itself.Don’t be fooled by the mild, vaguely theatrical rebuke Trump issued to Vladimir Putin on Thursday after Moscow unleashed a deadly wave of drone strikes on Kyiv, killing 12 and injuring dozens: “Vladimir, STOP!” Payattention instead to the fact that, in the nearly 100 days since Trump took office, the US has essentially switched sides in the battle between Putin’s Russia and democratic Ukraine, backing the invaders against the invaded.On Friday, Trump’s real-estate buddy and special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, held talks in Moscow with Putin. But any resemblance between the US and an honest broker is purely coincidental. On the contrary, previous encounters between the two men resulted in Witkoffparroting Kremlin talking points, essentially endorsing Russia’s claim to the Ukrainian territory it seized. In that, Witkoff was merely following the lead set by his boss: the supposed peace deal Trump is now in a hurry to seal amounts to handing Putin almost everything he wants and demanding Ukraine surrender.Hence Trump’s anger on Wednesday, when he accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of making “inflammatory statements”. What had the Ukrainian president said that was so incendiary? He had calmly pointed out that he could not do as Trump demanded and recognise Russian control of Crimea, which Russia grabbed in 2014, because it was forbidden by his country’s constitution. It’s telling that Trump should be enraged by a president who thinks constitutions have to be respected.Whether Trump succeeds in making Kyiv buckle or not, the new reality is clear. The US president is taking an axe to an international order constructed in the aftermath of a bloody world war, a system that has held, however imperfectly, since 1945. A central tenet of that order was that big states could not simply swallow up smaller ones, that unprovoked aggression and conquest would no longer be allowed to stand. Yet here is Trump bent on rewarding just such an act of conquest, not simply acquiescing in Putin’s land grab inUkrainebut conferring on it the legitimacy of approval by the world’s most powerful nation.Note how he speaks as if Putin had every right to seize the territory of his neighbour. Asked this week what concessions, if any, he had extracted from Moscow, Trump replied that Putin’s willingness to stop the war, rather than gobbling up Ukraine in its entirety, was a “pretty big concession”.This is not only a disaster for Ukraine, though it is obviously that. It is also the destruction of global architecture that has stood for many decades – and it is hardly a lone case. Trump’s tariff fetish is similarly upending a system of international trade that had made the world, and especially the US, more prosperous. The consequences are already visible, in plunging global stock markets,gloomy growth forecastsandwarnings of a recessionthat will start in the US and then spread everywhere else.Trump’s eagerness to acquiesce in Putin’s seizure of Ukraine makes a dead letter of international law, with its prohibition of the crime of aggression, and that too points to a wider pattern. For Trump is at war with the law at home as well as abroad. Indeed, in three short months, it has become an open question whether the rule of law still operates in the US.That peril is revealed most clearly in Trump’s willingness to defy the orders of the US courts. Judges have issued multiple rulings, seeking, for example, to delay or overturn the deportation of migrants without due process, only for those judges to be ignored or targeted with personal invective from the president. For the latestPolitics Weekly America podcast, I spoke to Liz Oyer, a former justice department official fired last month after she refused to restore gun-owning rights to the actor and Trump pal Mel Gibson: he hadlost themwhen he was convicted of domestic violence in 2011. Oyer is a sober, nonpartisan former civil servant, but she told me of her fears if the Trump administration continues to refuse to comply with the law as laid down by the courts. “We will have a true crisis on our hands. They are testing the limits.”Part of Trump’s assault on the law has come in a flurry of executive orders,targeting specific, named law firmsthat had previously acted for his opponents. He offered the firms a choice: either be barred by presidential diktat from cases involving the federal government, or commit to giving Trump and his administration free legal advice worth tens of millions of dollars. So many firms have caved in, the president now has access to an estimated $1bn (£750m) war chest of pro bono legal services. Trump has been bragging about it, but there’s a word for what he has done: extortion.It’s a favourite weapon of Trump’s and it’s been on display in Ukraine too. Let’s not forget the “deal” Trump wants to strike with Zelenskyy: a degree of US protection in return forhalf of the revenuefrom Ukraine’s minerals, ports and infrastructure. This is not the behaviour of an ally, but a gangster.Everything Trump does, and has always done, he is doing in and to Ukraine. Recall the hyperbolic promise he made to end the war within “24 hours” of returning to the White House. It was of a piece with the inflated hype that puffed up his real-estate career – and about as reliable. The same goes for his campaign promise to end inflation on “day one”, when his tariff policy is only going to push up prices.Now he threatens to walk away from Ukraine altogether, impatient to get a deal in time for his 100th-day celebrations on Tuesday. That’s typical too: so often Trump’s grand plans turn to dust because, if he doesn’t get an instant reward, he gets bored and drifts away. Witkoff’s previous role was securing a lasting ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Now that’s fallen apart, he’s moved on to other things.Above all, Trump’s willingness to capitulate to Putin on Ukraine is a reminder not only of his own authoritarian ambitions – he likes Putin because he wants to be like Putin – but also of how serially bad a negotiator this self-styled artist of the deal really is. He declared tariff war on China, thinking he could squeeze the US’s great economic rival. Instead, America’s biggest retailers this week warned that their shelves couldsoon be empty, thanks to the havoc Trump’s tariffs are unleashing on the global supply chain. Container traffic across the Pacific from China is already down byas much as 60%, meaning Americans are not going to get the goods they’ve come to rely on. Those shortages will lead to voter anger directed at Trump. To avert it, he needs a deal with China – desperately. He goes to the table weak, facing an opponent he has made strong. So much for the maestro dealmaker.There is no mystery to Trump. It’s all plain to see – the habits of the vandal, the autocrat, the gangster and the fool – with Ukraine as clear a guide as any. Not that that is any comfort to the people of that besieged land. They don’t want to be a cautionary tale, a demonstration case of the fecklessness and menace of Donald Trump. They want to be a free, independent nation. Their great misfortune is that the mighty country that should be their most powerful friend is now in the hands of an enemy.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist and the host of thePolitics Weekly America podcast100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guests.

Not yet, but it can’t let Reform and the right provide all the answersHenry HillThe complacency of the traditional left of the Conservative party is allowing the voices they abhor to take overFri 25 Apr 2025 09.08 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 11.43 EDTShareThis is not a happy time to be on the one-nation wing of the Conservative party. The final round of last year’s leadership election was between two candidates from the right of the party, and since then it has beenRobert Jenrick, the more rightwing of the two, who has emerged as the party’s centre of gravity – a remarkable feat for a man who lost the race.His recently reported comments about acoalition with Reform UK(or perhaps, as sources close to him insist, its voters) have put the question of the Tories’ future direction back in the spotlight. Is Nigel Farage the herald of a fundamental rightward shift? Is this, as one fellow journalist put it to me, “the final death of one-nation Toryism”?The short answer is “probably not” – at least not unless the Tory party dies its own final death. The “one nation” labeldates back to Benjamin Disraeli; it survived the reactionary hegemony of Lord Salisbury and the revolutionary one of Margaret Thatcher. So long as there is a Tory party, it will have a left wing and, historical labels being what they are, it will probably call itself one nation.Last year’s contest would also seem, on the surface at least, to provide that wing with some bullish indicators. Broadly speaking (for personal loyalties and ambitions confound precise readings from such tallies), James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat had the support of about half the parliamentary party. It took a realfeat of self-sabotagefor neither to reach the final. Yet there can be no doubt that one-nation Conservatismisin trouble – and the root of that trouble is that it is intellectually exhausted.Consider last year’s leadership election again. Many Cleverly supporters ended up rowing in behindKemi Badenochto stop Jenrick. They knew they didn’t like the policy direction he was proposing. But the alternative was a candidate who made a virtue of having no policy direction at all and who, on issues such as immigration and the European court of human rights, is now inching towards his positions anyway.Badenoch was an opportunity to hit the snooze button on an intellectual reckoning with the past 14 years, and postponing that reckoning has been the sum of the Tory left’s ambitions since the general election.Hence nonsensical arguments such as theConservativeslost not because of any failure of doctrine, but on “competence”, two things that cannot in politics be so cleanly distinguished. Where was the incompetence on immigration, for example: promising to cut it to the tens of thousands, or failing (indeed, not really trying) to fulfil that promise?View image in fullscreen‘The ‘one nation’ label dates back to Benjamin Disraeli.’Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe unhappy truth that capital-S “Sensible” Tory MPs must confront is that any “lurch to the right” over the past few years was almost entirely rhetorical rather than substantive, and with the exception of Brexit – which, however important you think it is, is not the root cause of our housing and energy price crises – they got what they wanted most of the time.Perhaps that feels counterintuitive, but it’s true. NHS spending increased by 25% in real terms between 2010 and 2023 without (post-Andrew Lansley) any serious effort at structural reform; more young people than ever were funnelled into higher education; immigration was allowed to rise to whatever level industry and sector lobby groups demanded; taxation levels soared.Yes, the Rwanda scheme was certainly very right-coded. But not only did Rishi Sunak bend over backwards to try – and fail – to implement it without fundamentally challenging our existing legal and treaty obligations, but the whole thing was in part a way to talk about immigration without talking aboutlegalimmigration, which Boris Johnson hadcasually doubled.This disconnect played a significant role in the Tories’ shattering defeat last year by alienating voters on all fronts; Badenoch is right to point out that the party “talked right, but governed left”, even if she cannot or will not offer any compelling explanation as to why.Perhaps the most telling evidence of this intellectual aridity is the way the Tories responded to the rise of Ukip. Like Jenrick now,Nigel Faragewas able for years to set the tempo of Conservative thinking – or at least Conservative language – on Europe and immigration; time and again, David Cameron either made promises he had no intention of keeping (net immigration to “tens of thousands”) or didn’t expect to have to keep (an in/out referendum).Some one-nation MPs certainly criticised his “pandering” in this way. But they never furnished him or his successors with an actual alternative solution to the problem of a party thatcame second in 100 seatsin 2015 and was well positioned to walk away with a critical slice of the Tory vote.Nigel Farage thinks net zero is the new Brexit. Starmer can prove him wrong | Rafael BehrRead moreAt root, the problem currently facing the one-nation Tories is, paradoxically, that they are the most small-c Conservative faction; often self-consciously non-ideological, and united around the principle that the status quo more or less works and requires only sensible adjustment to keep the ship of state on course.That is a healthy, conservative cast of mind, of course. But it can too easily ossify into a reflexive defence of the status quo, an instinctive distaste for radicalism mutating into the comforting belief that radical measures are never the answer, compounded in this case by the understandable reluctance on the part of former ministers to admit, even to themselves, to complacently presiding over systems that were slowly falling to pieces.Ultimately, the reason the right is making the policy running is that it is the only force on the field. What is the one-nation solution to mass immigration, save shoring up a Westminster consensus that allows public opinion to be safely ignored? To the looming financial apocalypses in higher education and local government? To the unsustainable trajectory of NHS and entitlement spending?I have no idea, and I write about the Conservative party for a living.It’s not that there aren’t ideas out there, intellectual threads that could be woven into a relevant one-nation philosophy and programme. But MPs have no right to grumble about their party gravitating towards Jenrick’s answers, or Farage’s, when for now they are the only people offering any.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionReform UKKemi BadenochRobert JenrickNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

Though there are times when it goes off like a firework, as young men’sTikTok-fuelled surgeof enthusiasm for Nigel Farage did last summer, sometimes it’s more of a long, slow burn. The most underexplored form of revolt against mainstream politics right now is the second kind, involving not angry young men lurching rightwards but anxious young women turning, if anything, more sharply left.Almost a quarter of women aged 18 to 24voted Green last July, roughly double the number of young men who voted Reform, though predictably it’s the latter who have since got all the attention. While the big parties chased avidly after so-calledWaitrose women, well-heeled home counties matrons considering defecting from the Tories, they had little to say to their daughters. So it was the Greens who ended up cornering the market in a certain kind of frustrated gen Z voter: typically a middle-class student or graduate in her early 20s, whose conscience is pricked every time she opens Instagram by heartrending images of orphans in Gaza or refugees drowning in the Channel, and who can’t understand why nobody seems to care. She’s angry about the rampant misogyny of some boys she knew at school, Donald Trump, greedy landlords and a burning planet, and the Greens’ more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger social media posts attacking Keir Starmer for choosing welfare cuts over wealth taxes strike a chord.But deeper down, perhaps, she’s angry that despite slogging diligently through school and university and possibly a master’s (the Greens do best among the highly educated) she still can’t count on a lifestyle like her parents had. For all the girls who put their heads down and worked at school while the boys kicked off and absorbed all the teachers’ attention, there may be something grimly familiar about a Labour party that seemingly takes them for granted while bending over backwards to placate noisy Reform voters.Why isn’t this quiet form of female political alienation ringing more alarm bells?The obvious answer is that there aren’t enough of these young women to swing an election, but young Reform-voting men caught the public imagination despite being an even smaller drop in the electoral ocean. And though it would be dangerous to get complacent, detailed research on so-called “Reform-curious” voters to be published next week by the thinktank Persuasion counters some of the wilder assumptions about gen Z men’s politics, finding that while it’s true they are more likely than older male voters to think favourably of Farage, they’re less likely to actually vote Reform. Strikingly, they’re also less likely than middle-aged gen X men now to say that feminism has gone too far. Maybe it’s not just schoolboys who should be sat down andmade to watch Netflix’s Adolescence, as MPs keep arguing,but their fathers. The growing consensus meanwhile among political scientists is that if young men’s and women’s worldviews are (as polls suggest) becoming ever morestarkly polarised, the driving force behind that split is women becoming sharply more liberal, not men becoming radically more rightwing.Rosie Campbell, professor of politics at King’s College London, is one of surprisingly few academics to have dug deeper into younger women’s political choices. For a start, it looks as if earlier waves of feminism have been the left’s unexpected recruiting sergeant: the historic trend is for women to become more liberal as more of them go to university or move into the labour market, and 57% of British university studentsare now female. But Campbell’s hunch is that young women’s radicalisation also has a lot to do with Brexit and its unfolding consequences. Women are noticeably more anti-austerity and pro-remain than men, she points out, which suggests they’re likely to have found the past nine years more frustrating.As the two biggest parties fell over themselves to embrace Brexit and then to rule out big wealth taxes, these women are likely to have been pushed further and further out to the political fringes. Alongside her colleague Rosalind Shorrocks, Campbell traces the start of the Green surge back to a pool of young female voters attracted by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of a “kinder, gentler politics”, who backed Labour in 2017 and then voted Green in the following set of European elections, and are unlikely now to be enthused by Starmer explaining why he no longer believes trans women are women. The final piece of the jigsaw, she suspects, may be social media: are the same algorithms blamed for leading young men down rightwing rabbit holes similarly reinforcing young women’s anger at social injustices, by feeding them an endless diet of the content they seem to click on most? If so, the gap between gen Z men and women is likely to grow, with consequences not just for politics but for the lives they may end up living alongside each other.Perhaps there will never be enough of them to count electorally. Or perhaps their furious idealism will simply fade with age. But the failure even to be curious about what it is young women are trying to say, just because their chosen revolt against the mainstream takes a less aggressive or destructive form than young Reformers’, feels profoundly unfair. Sometimes it pays to listen to people sitting quietly at the back, not just the ones screaming in your face.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionReform UKGreen partyWomenMenYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

Why did Yale allow this?Fri 25 Apr 2025 15.08 EDTFirst published on Fri 25 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTShareLet me start with a statement that should be obvious: deliberately starving 2 million people – half of whom are children – is indefensible. It is not complicated, it is not a nuanced situation that requires a PhD to parse. It is not an unfortunate and unavoidable part of war. It is quite simply indefensible. I would say that it is also very much prohibited by international human rights law, but that doesn’t seem to exist any more, does it?As I write this,no food, water or medicinehas been allowed intoGazafor almost two months. It is impossible to know just how bad the situation really is because Israel has imposed a media blackout on the region. However, aid organizationshave said: “The Gaza Strip is now likely facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the 18 months” since the war began. Thousands of children are malnourished. Childhood malnutrition, I can’t stress enough, has long-term consequences. An entire generation’s future has been violently stolen from them.“Starving kids to death is bad, actually” isn’t a statement that should require any debate. Over in the White House and the hallowed halls of Yale, however, they seem to think otherwise. OnWednesday night, an organization called Shabtai, which is based at Yale though not officially affiliated with it, hosted Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, for a talk.I spoke to children in Gaza this week and here’s what they told me: they just want to live | Shaima Al-ObaidiRead moreBen-Gvir has had the red carpet rolled out for him by the US. The extremist politician came to New Haven following an extravagant dinner, presumably paid for by US taxpayers, atDonald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort the night before. While he ate fancy food with Republican party officials they all reportedly discussed how they could starve kids in Gaza more efficiently. “[Lawmakers] expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed in order to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home safely,” Ben-Gvir tweeted following the dinner.I’ll give Ben-Gvir his due. He doesn’t even try to hide his hatred for Arabs. If Ben-Gvir were a Palestinian, every single politician and media outlet would be in an uproar that he was anywhere near Yale. The man lives on an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank and has advocated for the deportation of all Arab citizens. He had a picture in his living room for years of Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron in 1994. He has previous convictions forinciting racism and supporting terrorism.Again, Shabtai is not officially associated with Yale but it very much looks like a Yale organization, especially as it is based there. It was founded by the Democratic senator andYale alumnus Cory Bookerand the New Haven rabbi Shmully Hecht. Speaking to Shabtai, with all its elite associations, grants Ben-Gvir respectability. It gives his violent and racist ideas legitimacy. Particularly as Hecht – a man closely associated with Booker – has saidhe admires Ben-Gvir. At the time of writing, Booker hadn’t made a public statement about Ben-Gvir’s Shabtai invitation and had not responded to a request for comment.Several Shabtai members, I should note, have objected to Hecht’s comments about Ben-Gvir and two have resigned from the society. But Yale has not issued a clear condemnation of the far-right politician. Again: Shabtai is not an official Yale organization but it has enough ties to the university that, by not speaking out, the Ivy League institute is in effect endorsing one of the most extremist politicians in Israel. Particularly since Yale has simultaneously been very busy doing what US colleges seem to enjoy doing most: demonizing anyone who speaks out about genocide. A pro-Palestinian student group was stripped of its official recognition by Yale after it was accused of involvement inprotests against Ben-Gvir.But I don’t want to focus too much on Ben-Gvir because he’s not the real issue here. This isn’t about one man giving a speech – it’s about who is allowed to speak and who isn’t. What facts get reported and what don’t. What the media, politicians and thought leaders choose to get outraged about and what they ignore. It’s about the real-time manufacturing of consent for the US-enabled atrocities happening inGazaand the West Bank, and the systematic quashing of dissent.Pro-Palestinian speech is beingsystematically eradicatedin the US on multiple fronts. Palestinian viewpoints are being erased, punished or ignored. Ice, of course, has been very busy for weeks nowdetainingand deporting pro-Palestinian activists. Meanwhile, on Wednesday the FBI violently raided the homes of pro-Palestinian activists linked to University of Michigan protests. And earlier this week a performance by the R&B star Kehlani at Cornell University in New York state was cancelled, with the university’s president saying the booking of the singer had “injected division and discord” at Cornell because ofher stance on Israel.The message from the government and from elite institutions is very clear: speak up about Palestine and you will be punished for it. These raids and deportations, the cancelling of contracts and opportunities, aren’t just meant to punish individuals, but to have a chilling effect on the masses.More insidious silencing is happening on social media, where it is getting harder to share pro-Palestinian content. According to leaked internal Meta data recently obtained byDrop Site News: “A sweeping crackdown on posts on Instagram and Facebook that are critical of Israel – or even vaguely supportive of Palestinians – was directly orchestrated by the government of Israel … The data show that Meta has complied with 94% of takedown requests issued by Israel since October 7, 2023.”Dozens of my family have been killed by Israel in Gaza, and now Ziyad, too. Only one thing gives me solace | Ghada AgeelRead moreOn cable news, Palestinian perspectives are routinely ignored. (Networks that were preoccupied with issues of campus safety in the past certainly don’t seem to have run any segments about how Arab students at Yale might feel threatened by having Ben-Gvir celebrated on campus.) Last December, the Nation analyzed a year’s worth of Palestine-Israel coverage by four Sunday morning news shows – NBC’s Meet the Press, ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos, CBS’s Face the Nation and CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. It found that “withthe exception of one interview, the Sunday shows covered and debated the so-called ‘Israel-Hamas war’ for 12 months without speaking to a single Palestinian or Palestinian American.” The shows featured Israeli guests 20 times, along with multiple appearances from pro-Israel US guests. This is what “objectivity” on Palestine and Israel looks like in the media.Once again: kids are being actively starved to death in Gaza as I write this. This should prompt nonstop outrage in the media. And yet there seems to have been far more outrage in certain sections of the US media about the fact that the Irish rap group Kneecap recently ended their Coachella set by displaying the message: “Fuck Israel, Free Palestine.” Fox News went into acomplete tizzyabout it. Meanwhile, Sharon Osbourne denounced their “aggressive statements” and called for the group to have theirUS visas revoked. Kneecap responded to Osbourneby noting: “Statements aren’t aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.” If only that were more obvious to people.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsYale UniversityOpinionIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warChildrenPalestinian territoriesUS universitiescommentShareReuse this content"

I won a historic victory in Poole forLabourlast July on the basis that things would change – and change for the better.But my constituents, already fearful ofplansfor the largestcuts to disability supportin a generation, have been getting in touch with me about new legislation that might be news to you: thegovernment is resurrectingTory proposals for mass spying on people who receive state support.The powers contained in the public authorities (fraud, error and recovery) bill quite rightly seek to tackle organised crime and online fraud, but they alsousher in new powersfor the banks to trawl through bank details of individuals – even where there is no suspicion of wrongdoing.This legislation would compel banks tocarry out financial surveillanceof welfare recipients. Given the volume of accounts involved, this will be completed by an algorithm. If the software flags a possible overpayment, whether due to fraud or error, the bank will report the individual to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for further investigation.Why should someone in receipt of benefits have fewer rights to privacy? And why are we asking banks to become an arm of the state?These new powers strip those who receive state support of a fundamental principle of British law: the presumption of innocence. By default, welfare recipients would be treated as suspects, simply because they need support from the state.The risk of aHorizon-style scandalon a massive scaleis glaringly obviouswhen millions are being monitored. It will be disabled people, carers, pensioners and the very poorest people who are impacted by wrongful investigations and forced to endure burdensome appeals to prove their innocence.It has been suggested that the powers would help identify overpayments more quickly, but the DWP already has ample data-sharing and data-matching powers at its disposal. Thecarer’s allowance scandal, when unpaid carers were plunged into debt and prosecuted for fraud because of the DWP’s own overpayments, provides an example of where the department was failing to use the access to real-time alerts of carers’ earnings they already had to stop overpayments. The government admits that if fraudsters spread assets across multiple accounts, they won’t be flagged.The bill also grants the DWP draconian powers to apply to a court to have peoplestripped of their driving licencesif they have outstanding debt, where all other attempts at recovery have failed. The government claims this will be a last resort where the debtor fails to engage with the DWP. In practice, it means officials will first attempt todeduct fundsdirectly from their bank account. To do this, they must secretly request at least three months of bank statements from a bank without informing the individual, to assess whether the deduction would cause “hardship”. If it would, the person would eventually face the threat of losing their licence. That’s not justice – it’s a poverty penalty.The so-called safeguards for vulnerable debtors are also inadequate, relying heavily on court oversight and the ability of individuals to make personal representations. This overlooks the fact that these powers only apply to those deemed not to have “engaged” with the DWP – a standard that fails to recognise how non-engagement is often a symptom of genuine hardship and the circumstances in which people find themselves, rather than any wrongdoing.Many benefit recipients live with mental health conditions, disabilities, or have caring responsibilities that make navigating complex bureaucracy extremely difficult. All these challenges will only be made worse if the government proceeds with its planned cuts to disability benefits, which willaffect over 3 million familiesand force many disabled individuals into crisis and destitution.Ill and disabled people will be made ‘invisible’ by UK benefit cuts, say expertsRead moreI have proposed amendments to this bill to ensure that only those suspected of fraud are subject to surveillance, allowing the government to target criminality without monitoring the public. I have also proposed removing the power to apply to a court to strip people of their driving licences due to debt. There are fairer and more effective ways to enforce the law.We must prevent the corruption of our welfare state into a punitive system, where the price of accessing support is the sacrifice of privacy and exposure to the uniquely cruel sanction of being stripped of mobility.The welfare state needs to wrap its arms around those who need it. It should be there for everyone, but this approach undermines public trust in the system. The change we promised must mean a more compassionate and caring society, one that enables rather than penalises. These values are what makes us different from the previous government – and we shouldn’t forget that.Neil Duncan-Jordan is the Labour MP for PooleExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionWelfareBenefitscommentShareReuse this content"

A day after the“peace talks” in London, which the US secretary of state Marco Rubio didn’t even turn up for, Ukrainians were not anxiously waiting for the results of a possible deal, which looked unfeasible anyway. Instead, theywere counting their dead.According to Ukraine’s air force, in the early hours of Thursday morningRussia launched11 Iskander ballistic missiles, 37 KH-101 cruise missiles, six Iskander-K cruise missiles, 12 Kalibr cruise missiles, 4 KH-59/KH-69 missiles and 145 drones. For Kyiv and Kharkiv residents that night, this was not just a case of reading numbers on a news feed,but hearing and feeling explosions rock their cities. It turned out to bethe deadliest nightfor the Ukrainian capital this year.“Not necessary and very bad timing,” Donald Trump later wrote on social media. But, Ukrainians might ask, when would be a better time to kill 12 civilians and injure at least 90?Most people were asleep in the western suburbs ofKyiv that were hit. Most of the homes in a five-story apartment block were damaged. A ballistic missile –allegedly North Korean– destroyed an older two-story house. Most of the casualties lived there.At the time of writing – late afternoon on Thursday – rescue workers and firefighters had been working on the pile of rubble for 15 hours. A group of teenagers came to watch. Some arrived early in the morning because their friend and schoolmate, Danya Khudya, 17, lived in that house with his parents. Earlier, Danya’s sister was sent to the hospital, but the boywas missing under the rubble. So, the kids started to search, helping the rescue workers and the police. “Is he alive?” they kept asking.US military aid for Ukraine is about to cease. Is Europe ready? | David ShimerRead moreBy the end of the day, more than 50 young people were there silently gazing into the rubble behind the tape. They stood, hardly moving, just hugging each other. They were waiting for a miracle. It didn’t happen. Around 5pm, Danya’s body was found. The relatives were asked to identify the body. His parents, Vika and Oleh, had died, too.In front of the house, I saw a man, his face covered with shrapnel injuries , standing in his slippers. He was offered help – someone asked if he needed proper shoes. But he refused and didn’t understand why he was being treated as a victim. He said that he had everything at home. Should he be grateful?I have written before about how Kyivites haveturned their anger into action. They are still doing that now, but there is also something else in the air – a sense of confusion and bewilderment. Is this the new normal?I think this is because residents of the capital had become used to Ukraine’s air defences protecting the city.The first Patriots– the US army’s central air defence system –arrived in Kyiva year after the invasion in February 2022. The system proved capable of intercepting and destroying theKinzhal, a Russian hypersonic ballistic missile.Vladimir Putin had boastedthat the missiles were “invincible”. Since then, hundreds of them have been repelled in the air above Ukraine’s cities and towns.But there arefewer than 10 air defence systems in Ukraine– this is simply not enough for what is, after all, the second-largest country in Europe after Russia. Recently, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a request to the US to buy – not to be given –10 additional Patriot systems.Trump treated it as a joke, as an example of Ukrainian warmongering.This matters because the missiles for the Patriots are the most important part of US military aid (beyond intelligence) that European partners can’t deliver themselves. Even if allies try to buy them forUkraine, it is up to the US to permit outsourcing them. On top of that, Washington can remotely restrict use of the system, as it retains control over the technology and components, which rely on US software updates and radar configurations.This is the real leverage that the US has against Ukraine – the cudgel it could use to force Kyiv into accepting peace on Russian terms.Those terms includefreezing the frontline, Ukraine conceding up to 20% of its sovereign land and relying on Moscow’s goodwill that it would not attack again. In comparison, Russia might receive not just recognition by the US of illegally annexed Ukrainian territories, but also the lifting of US sanctions.Ukrainians don’t have the luxury of indulging in the fantasies and distortions of Truth Social, or X, or Russian state TV. They have no choice but to believe in the rockets flying over their heads, the news of dead neighbours – in short, in reality. The events of this week are about as vivid a demonstration you can get that the war is still happening, that it is real, and that Moscow has no real desire to end it.Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism LabDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But I’ve seen firsthand how they cut crimeSimon JenkinsBy steering Britain’s young people down a positive path, these centres answer a chronic need. Why doesn’t the government protect them?Fri 25 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 12.32 EDTShareAt next week’s local elections, few will be voting on how their council is run. They will be passing judgment on Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch and other national figures. Local democracy no longer thrives in Britain. An opinion poll would be cheaper.Cut to the humble youth club. I supported a private charity in my old borough of Camden, north London, that was struggling to turn young people, mostly in their teens, away from a life of crime. The local council-run youth club had been forced to close.The charity’s triumphs are many, and its contributions to the neighbourhood have been little short of sensational. In one year, they include 300 young people guided back to school or college after a suspension, 60 who were found jobs, 205 who completed a mental health programme, 52 gang mediations and 231 knives surrendered. The charity reckons half the people it served were saved from turning to crime.This is a private venture run from a church and supported by donations and grants. Its service can only be described as utterly essential. It is answering a chronic urban need. Yet these types of services are collapsing. An Institute for Fiscal Studies report last year charted a30% fallin the number of youth centres in London between 2010 and 2019. A similar Unison survey found that1,243 council youth clubsin England and Wales closed over the austerity period, with just 581 still operating.The government boasts that it is fighting crime. It is doing so by increasing police numbersby 13,000(by 2029) and buildingfour new prisons. These prisons willcost a staggering £2.3bnand lock up 14,000 more criminals. This seems an extravagance when nothing is being done to limit crime in the first place. Britain still refuses to go down the route that even New York now takes, in licensing and regulating its cannabis market. It leaves county lines rampant. The government refuses to imitate Norway and other European countries whose prisons are primarily for rehabilitation rather than punishment. Britishreoffending ratesare more than twice as high as Norway’s. Britain breeds crime. Norway cures it.Nothing would more obviously cut crime than helping young people avoid becoming criminals. The most glaring statistic at present is that, after the pandemic, school suspensions and absencessoared by 67%. We should note that violence, burglary and car crime havefallen dramaticallyover the decades in Britain and crime hysteria is inappropriate. But exclusion from school is a surefire warning of trouble ahead. So why is it so neglected?The answer is that democracy can be a cruel taskmaster. Over the years, central government has grasped ever more functions of the welfare state, or at least the ones that carry political clout and glamour. Westminster has taken control ofhospitals,most secondary educationand now, under the present government,housing supplyandeven potholes. All these topics adorn the Commons dispatch box and win money and manifesto pledges. The prime minister behaves as if he were mayor of England.The Cinderellas left to the discretion of local councils include rubbish collection, libraries, care of the elderly and youth clubs. Since the sums spent on these functions are not ordained by central government, they were butchered by austerity after 2010. They have never recovered. The collapse of NHS hospitals has been partly attributed to the failure of the care sector. Some 800 libraries haveclosed. Youth clubs have suffered the worst, withtwo-thirdsvanishing.There are two sorts of public servant in a welfare state. There are those who live by their phones, issue orders, spend money and quantify success. And there are others who go out and make human contact with those who need them. Youth workers make it their job to befriend the lonely, who have escaped their homes on to the street. There they are vulnerable to bullying, gang membership, violence and the dark alleys of the drugs market. They must be the hardest people to help.Youth centres may seem tame places – a pool table, a boxing ring, some books, a health adviser, an ex-offender turned mentor. But they save huge amounts of money in averting that most extravagant of occupations, a life of crime and punishment. At present, Britain is everywhere seeing the closure of places of communal coming together. Churches, pubs, playing fields, police stations and high street shops are fast disappearing. The public realm is facing abandonment. Of this fate, the loss of the youth club would be most dangerous of all.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionCrimeAusterityLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

That doesn’t mean I want to endlessly keep traversing itFri 25 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 12.32 EDTShare‘Fast travel”. The greatest two words in gaming. Greater even than “infinite lives”,Clive Sinclairor “moustachioed plumber”. It is to go from one location in a game where you are doing something important to another location in the blink of a loading screen, cutting out the repetitive kerfuffle in between. (Trivia break: Repetitive Kerfuffle might have been the working title for Tetris!)We’ve had it since the 80s. Dragon Quest had a Return spell and the original Zelda had the recorder to take you to different dungeons, and even they were preceded six years earlier by a certain big fat yellow mouth who had dots for supper and ghosts for dessert. Because that guy could go out of one side of the screen and appear on the other instantly. That’s fast travel isn’t it? My advocacy for this is however tempered by the depression I feel that PacMan may have thought going off the right hand side would mean an escape from his corridor hell, only to return, Sisyphus-like, back where he started.The Sisyphus reference is apt because, even more than the chafing hands and sore calves, the biggest problem the boulder-pushing Greek had was boredom. Fast travel is essential because we play video games to escape the tedium of real life. And the most tedious thing in life is travel of any kind. Even with the latest fad forspace flights, you have to go through the boring grind of making the $20m for the ticket in return for 12 minutes of seeing the Earth look just like it does in the pictures.When a developer puts fast travel in a game, they are saying: “I get you. We both want you to enjoy this game. So we will fast as much of this tedious travel as we can.”View image in fullscreenSisyphean nightmare … Pac-ManPhotograph: Richard Drew/APNot Rebellion Developments though. Not with Atomfall. Atomfall doesn’t just ignore fast travel, it depends on your ability to yomp across great swathes of land you have already yomped across. With really tough enemies. It reduces the game to a study in anger at times.And this is such a shame because I loved so much about it. The story is fascinating: What reallydidhappen during the Windscale nuclear plant disaster in England in 1957. A fire there was rated a five out of seven on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale. Chernobyl was a seven. The end of that recent episode ofThe Last of Uswas a six.In the game, this event has turned a section of theLake Districtinto a radioactive quarantine zone, and you wake up in the middle of it with no memory of who you are or how you got there, and then stumble around gleaning bits of info off people in return for doing their bidding. I enjoyed peeling this onion of conflicting information from nicely grey moral characters with just about every accent in the UK displayed at some point or other, because nothing brings the country together like a good old-fashioned quarantine.I don’t mind that it doesn’t have a traditional RPG skill tree. There is no XP to grind for. Just Training Stimulants you can find and exchange for better stealth, stamina, weaponry and so on. But there can be too many quests open at the same time. I hope that when the apocalypse hits in this life (next Tuesday at this rate), it is a lot less busy.I also don’t mind that Atomfall is very tough to play, even if you reduce the combat to the lowest level (Useless Dad), but I do mind having a tiny backpack and not enough accessible storage tubes for surplus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That is a beautiful detail. But I grew to hate the ridiculous slogs between all this, especially in the final third of the game, which should be when RPGs get into their slickest phase.Apparently the developers’ reason for nixing fast travel was that they wanted you to be totally immersed in this world they created. And what a world it is visually! The countryside is so lush and gorgeous it’s like a work of art. And unlike the Sistine Chapel, you don’t have to crick your neck to see it. Maybe the developers were so pleased that they may have created the most beautifully rendered world in game graphics history that they thought: “OK, we will jolly well make sure the punters get to spend time with nothing to do but behold it.”It’s a shame because the world is well set up. The factions of military, outlaws, citizens, hippie mystics and zombies are my kind of party, although the enemy AI is inconsistent and the Big Bad is the most sedentary villain since Davros. With fast travel, I would have completed the game in 10 hours and been raving for more. As it was Atomfall had me wandering around a new place getting angry and resentful at things I had to keep doing for other people. And I already have family vacations for that.Explore more on these topicsGamesRole playing gamesNuclear powerEnergyLake DistrictcommentShareReuse this content"

Others are realising that they can’t afford not toFri 25 Apr 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 14.16 EDTShareEnfeebling universities or seizing control is an early chapter in the authoritarian playbook, studied eagerly by the likes ofViktor Orbán in Hungary. “Would-be authoritarians and one-party states centrally target universities with the aim of restricting dissent,” Jason Stanley, a scholar of fascism at Yale,wrotein the Guardian in September. Last month, he announced that he wasleaving the USfor Canada because of the political climate and particularly thebattle over higher education.It is not merely that universities are often bastions of liberal attitudes and hotbeds for protest. They also constitute one of the critical institutions of civil society; they are a bulwark of democracy. The Trump administration is taking on judges, lawyers,NGOsand the media: it would be astonishing if universities were not on the list. They embody the importance of knowledge, rationality and independent thought.In a typically brazen reversal, Donald Trump has accused his administration’s top target – Harvard – of being the“threat to democracy”. The administration is attackingdiversity, equity and inclusion effortsand says it is tackling the failure of universities to root out antisemitism – a claim widelychallenged. Most Trump supporters are unlikely to take issue with cutting billions of dollars of public spending on wealthy elite institutions. A pragmatic counter-argument would be that much of that money goes to scientific and medical research that will enrich the US as a nation and benefit vast numbers of people who have never ventured near an Ivy League university.The administration’s outrageous demands of Harvard include federal oversight of admissions, the dismantling of diversity programmes, an end to recruitment of international students “hostile to American values”, and the compelled hiring of “viewpoint diverse” staff.Harvard has commendably chosen to fight back. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” wrote its president, Alan Garber. It issuingthe government over the freeze on $2.2bn in federal funding, part of a threat to withhold $9bn. That is encouraging others to speak out. Over 150 university presidents have signed a joint letterdenouncing“unprecedented government overreach and political interference”.Many have pointed out that the world’s richest university can afford to stand firm thanks to itsunrivalled $53bn endowmentand sympatheticbillionaire alumni. But its the same prestige and power that have surely made it the primary target: force it to fold, and weaker institutions will follow. It’s worth noting that Harvard toughened its position after faculty, students and alumnipushed hard for it to do so, warning that concessions would only encourage the administration. Columbiaacquiescedto an extraordinary list of demands but $400m of withheld funding has yet to be restored, and the administration is reportedly seekingto extend controlover the university.Whatever comes of Harvard’s suit, this is an administration that has already chosen to ignore court rulings. It may step up its assault, by revoking charitable status and clamping down on international students. (Many may already be concluding that studying in the US, however eminent the institution, may not be worth the hostile immigration environment.) But Harvard is fighting back not just because it can, but because it must. In doing so, it is defending not only academic freedom, but democracy more broadly – and inspiring others to do so.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You believe a writer’s unpublished work is fair game after their death or you don’t, and Didion – it would seem – didn’t.Debate about the ethics of posthumous publication has been ignited once more, this time with Didion at its centre. After the writer’s death in 2021, about 150 pages were found in a file next to her desk. These were meticulous accounts of sessions with her psychiatrist, from 1999 to 2003, focused mainly on her adopted daughter Quintana, who was spiralling into alcoholism. Addressed to her husband, screenwriterJohn Gregory Dunne, this journal has been published under the titleNotes to John. “No restrictions were put on access,” we are told in a brief, anonymous introduction, presumably the ghostly hand of her literary estate.The history of posthumous works is a long and contentious one, from Virgil’s Aeneid to the publication of Gabriel García Márquez’sUntil Augustlast year. Márquez’s sons excused their“act of betrayal”in publishing this abandoned novel against the Nobel laureate’s wishes as a service to his readers. In 2009, Vladimir Nabokov’s son published his father’s incomplete last work,The Original of Laura, 30 years after his death, despite his instructions that the novel be destroyed.Harper Lee’s“lost” manuscriptGo Set a Watchman(discovered in a safe deposit box) caused a sensation when it was published in 2015. Lee was 89 and in very poor health. It became thefastest-selling novelin HarperCollins history. But the critical verdict on all these recent “rediscoveries” was that the authors had good reasons not to want them published.However, it is not always a case of publish and be damned. Most famously, we would not have Kafka’s The Trial had his executor, Max Brod, not ignored his demand that it be burned. “Don’t pull the Max Brod-Kafka trick on me,” Michel Foucaultreportedlywarned his friends.Henry James made a “gigantic bonfire” of his archive. Thomas Hardy followed suit. Philip Larkin’s diaries, more prosaically, were committed to a shredding machine and then the University of Hull’s boiler house. “What he wished to be remembered would be remembered,” Larkinwroteof Hardy. “What he wished forgotten would be forgotten.”How much of Notes to John was meant to be forgotten? Didion wrote two memoirs:The Year of Magical Thinking, after Dunne’s sudden death in 2003, and, later,Blue Nights, about her relationship with Quintana, who died in 2005 at the age of 39. In both, her daughter’s addiction is gracefully elided.Didion was America’sliterary celebrity. Aged 80, famous for her sunglasses, the author becamethe face of luxury fashion houseCeline. Today, her image is printed ontote bagsfor bookish hipsters. Notes to John is a further offering to the cult of Joan. What could be more irresistible than her therapy notes?It seems unlikely that Didion, that most reticent of people and most exacting of writers, would have welcomed these intimate, unedited journals seeing the light of day. But it is implausible that she would have been unaware of the inevitability of their publication. In Notes for John we see Didion bare-faced. We see her pain. But still she remains an enigma.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

What is not in doubt is thatBlack men aretwo to three times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer than white men, andtwice as likelyto die from it. Add a family history of significant prostate cancer and the odds become even worse, bringing diagnosis to one in two and a risk likely greater than one in six with both risk factors,if untreated.Thesefigureshave not changed for more than 10 years in the UK. Countering these stark statistics by quoting a single study showing Black British men are less likely to present with advanced disease does not detract from the fact that a family history and African or Caribbean heritage are primary risk factors for significant prostate cancer.Prostate Cancer UKhighlights the critical role of race in the fight against prostate cancer, stating that racial factors are not only significant in understanding disease prevalence but are central to addressing broader health inequities.Therefore, our message is clear and simple: if you are a Black man and/or if you have a family history of prostate cancer – get tested sooner rather than later. Ignoring racial risk factors only sustains Eurocentric blind spots in research, policy and care failing thosemost at risk.The testing of men in higher risk groups has the full support of the major prostate cancer charities and national urological organisations. The time to highlight this is now, and strive to provide more equitable and accessible care.Suks MinhasProfessor of urology, Imperial College, London,Ben ChallacombeAssociate professor,urologist and prostate surgeon, Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals, Londonand the UCLH, Guy’s and St Thomas’ and South Bank University diversity research collaborativeHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Good on him for spelling out the impact of his loss. I hope in his case that time does indeed heal.Phil MurrayLinlithgow, West LothianI feel for John Crace. I too am in deep, painful and alarming mourning for my faithful and beautiful dog, who died in my arms last month. I didn’t come from a “doggie” family and George was my first (and only) dog. I am reminded of lines from the Rudyard Kipling poem,The Power of the Dog: “There is sorrow enough in the natural way / From men and women to fill our day; / And when we are certain of sorrow in store, / Why do we always arrange for more? /Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware / Of giving your heart to a dog to tear”.Margaret DixonLongridge, LancashireHow I feel for John Crace. Mollie, our 14-year‑old working cocker, died last month. The grief I felt was unimaginable. I missed her physical presence, her unconditional love, her gentleness with children. But her death also brought up feelings of sadness hidden away over the years. I was engulfed by grief, remembering my parents, my son, my friends who had died. I wished I’d let her on the sofa and cuddled her more.Jo BurdenMarlow, BuckinghamshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The first is their grand slam decider against France, which kicks off at 4.45pm. The second – at the same venue, five months and one day later – is the World Cup final which, if everything goes as the team hopes at the Stadium of Light, Franklin’s Gardens, Ashton Gate and the other grounds they will visit between now and then, will be the next game they play at the home of English rugby.The Red Roses head coach, John Mitchell, has been around long enough to know the smart thing to do is separate the two. “We’ve got to be careful focusing on the World Cup final because we’ve got to earn the right to contest it,” Mitchell said this week. “It’s good to have the chance to be back at our home stadium, but it’s an isolated situation, that’s the way we see it.”England seek seventh heaven in Six Nations slam decider with FranceRead moreBut the two games are twin peaks. If the Red Roses make it to the top of the first one, they will only see the second beyond it. The Six Nations is familiar terrain. They have won the title six times in a row and are on a run of 33 consecutive victories in the competition. But they have not been up to the summit of the World Cup since 2014 when Katy Daley-McLean’s teambeat Canada 21-9 at the Stade Jean Bouinin Paris. Eleven years is a long time in any sport and a lifetime in one moving as fast as women’s rugby. Only a handful of players from that squad are still in this one.The years in between have seen the development of a professional game, the introduction of new annual domestic and international competitions, theseparation of the women’s Six Nations from the men’s tournament, the launch of the Olympic Sevens and the expansion of the World Cup to include 16 teams.And the remarkable progress of the Red Roses, who have proved themselves to be one of the most successful sports team on the planet. In this Six Nations:38-5 v Italy,67-12 v Wales,49-5 v Ireland,59-7 v Scotland. They have rattled up 213 points and conceded only 29, scored 33 tries and shipped six, and – by their own admission – done it all without ever turning in a performance they have been entirely happy with. They have won 25 games in a row, and 54 of their last 55. Which brings us right around to that one they lost.It was, of course, the last World Cup final, when they went down34-31 to the Black Fernsat Eden Park in one of the most compelling games of the last decade. When you win as often as the Red Roses do, the losses are going to stay with you. This one still haunts them. The feeling back then was the team were so used to winning (they went into that match on the back of 30 consecutive victories) they struggled when the game began to turn against them. It is Mitchell’s job to make sure the same thing does not happen again this year.View image in fullscreenEngland players console one another after losing the 2021 World Cup final match against New Zealand.Photograph: Marty Melville/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen Wales were in their prime, Warren Gatland used to say he felt they had forgotten how to lose. With the Red Roses, the worry is that they have forgotten what to do when it feels they might. Mitchell relies on internal competition between his first and second teams to create that sense of pressure. “It is unusual, especially to people on the outside,” says Mitchell, “but what you don’t see is what we’re doing internally, we get plenty of failure in training, and we thrive on that, that’s where we get our drive.”There is a lot riding on whether they can pull it off. In England, the World Cup has been pitched as an opportunity to grow the game. The RFU has launched a project called Impact ‘25 in partnership with UK Sport and Sport England, which has provided £12m in funding for the women’s game, a lot of it for basic amenities like upgraded toilets and changing rooms.Given that the Red Roses’ run of results was the key reason why the RFU was able to meet its elite performance targets (which allowed their executives, including the CEO Bill Sweeney, to claim the lion’s share of their six-figure bonuses) it is the least they ought to be doing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The women’s version is the one area of the game which is still growing, and fast. World Rugby say that the number of registered participants has increased by more than 50% in the three years since the last World Cup and a series of attendance records have been set around the world including in England, where a crowd of 58,598 turned out for their game against Ireland in 2023. These are double-edged statistics, which reflect the time, money and attention the governing bodies are now investing into women’s sport, and also their dismal lack of support for it in the years gone by.Ticket sales for this grand slam match have been underwhelming. The RFU is expecting Twickenham to be half full on Saturday, whereas all the talk beforehand was that it might be the first time in history that the ground had been sold-out for a women’s match.It is a sign of how far the women’s game has come that a crowd that size can be described as disappointing, the first women’s World Cup final in 1991 did not get 4,000 spectators, let alone 40,000, and there is little doubt Twickenham will be sold out for the final in five months’ time. It seems likely that a lot of fans decided to save their money for that tournament. As demand goes up, so do expectations, and English rugby is banking on the Red Roses rising to meet them.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Six NationsWomen's rugby unionEngland women's rugby union teamFrance women's rugby union teamRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A statement from Madrid finally confirmed that they would play after 10pm on Friday night, just 24 hours before kick-off.A previous statement from Madrid had demanded that the Spanish football federation (RFEF) take action after comments made by the referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea in the buildup to the game. That came after Madrid had refused to show up for the pre-match press conference, training session or the managers’ photocall at the Cartuja Stadium in Seville. Amid reports from media close to the club that they were contemplating refusing to play the match, Madrid finally confirmed their participation late on Friday night.“Faced by the rumours that have emerged in the last few hours,Real Madridwish to communicate that our team has never proposed renouncing playing in tomorrow’s final,” the statement said. “Our club understands that the unfortunate and inappropriate declarations made by the referees assigned to this game, made 24 hours before the final, cannot stain a sporting event of global significance which millions of people will watch.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The statement said that Madrid were acting “out of respect to all those fans who have travelled to Seville and those that are already in the Andalucían capital,” concluding that “the values of football should prevail, despite the hostility and animosity of that has today once again been made clear against our club, by the referees assigned to the final.”The statement finally brought to an end a long evening of uncertainty. Carlo Ancelotti and Luka Modric were scheduled to speak to the media at 7.15pm local time in Seville but, with the media waiting for them, they did not show.There was no announcement at the time and Madrid did not directly explain the decision later. Nor did they admit to asking the RFEF to remove De Burgos Bengoetxea or the VAR official Pablo González Fuertes. But a statement released an hour later described the referees’ remarks as “premeditated”, using a “threatening tone” and demonstrating a “manifest hostility” towards Real Madrid.The club accused the referees of “announcing supposed actions which are far from the principles of equality, objectivity and impartiality which should prevail a few hours before a footballing event followed by millions of people around the world”.Had Madrid not shown up, they would have faced a year-long ban from the competition and a fine of between €3,000 and €12,000. Eleven years they have waited for aclasicofinal and when at last it came, it was the referee in the spotlight when it fell upon Seville.Madrid had been angered by a pre-match press conference in which De Burgos Bengoetxea and González Fuertes talked about the club’s repeated criticism of referees on their TV channel. Pushed centre stage and exposed, made protagonists of the preview, both men appeared to have come with a message to deliver 24 hours before the game. Asked about the pressure they are under, especially from Real Madrid TV, González Fuertes warned of the impact on young officials, and said that stronger actions had to be taken.De Burgos Bengoetxea meanwhile was close to tears as he recounted the impact it has on his children. “When a child goes to school and people tell him his father is a thief it’s messed up,” the official said, his voice breaking. “All I can do is educate my son so that he knows that his father is honourable, show him what refereeing is, and for everyone to reflect on where we want to go; I would like you all to know, it is very hard.”View image in fullscreenReal Madrid remonstrate with referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea in 2023.Photograph: Jose Breton/APGonzález Fuertes said said: “More than what is said [in the videos], it’s the consequences of what is said. We see anonymous people on social media insulting and threatening referees without any control, those responsible for clubs’ social media continuously attacking us. The consequences of talking about robberies and using bad words, that frustration you create among fans, is something that the boys and girls who pick up a whistle to do a kids’ game end up paying for. That is the consequence of putting a target on a colleague’s head. We’re not going to allow it to keep happening.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Barcelona’s press conferences were at 5.15pm, during which Hansi Flick had said: “We need the referees.” Madrid were due to appear two hours later. But, as they had done with the Ballon d’Or ceremony in October,they did not show up, cancelling everything. There would be no press conference, no training session and no handshake between the coaches, accompanied by the trophy. The president, Florentino Pérez, had already decided not to attend any of the institutional events.The RFEF subsequently confirmed that Madrid had told them that they would not be participating in any pre-match activities.Madrid wanted the Federation to remove De Burgos Bengoetxea from refereeing duties, considering his position untenable following the press conference and what they saw as a conflict of interests. But they did not directly or publicly demand for that to happen and the first of their two subsequent statements stopped short of repeating that threat openly. Instead, their position had been expressed through the media close to the club hierarchy, which also leaked the possibility of them not turning up for the match.“Real Madrid CF considers the public statements made today by the referees appointed for the Copa del Rey final to be unacceptable,” the club said in a statement. “These remarks made in a premeditated manner, 24 hours before [kick-off and] against one of the participants in the final demonstrate, once again, a clear and manifest animosity and hostility against Real Madrid.“Given the seriousness of what happened, Real Madrid expects the RFEF and the refereeing establishment to act accordingly, adopting the relevant measures in defence of the institutions that they represent.”The RFEF insisted that it would not change the referees and that it expected the game to go ahead but conversations continued and the wait for confirmation went on into the evening until Madrid announced that they had never contemplated boycotting. Ancelotti was not in the press room at La Cartuja at 7.15pm local time, but his team will be out on the pitch at 10pm on Saturday night.Explore more on these topicsCopa del ReyReal MadridBarcelonaLa LigaEuropean club footballRefereesnewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes he tells his squad the lineup the day before a game, on other occasions half an hour before they depart the team hotel for the stadium on a match day. Training tends to offer some clues but of late there have been surprises. Emery, a hugely emotional character, has been known to make impulsive, snap calls. Morgan Rogers, a rare mainstay and one of Villa’s trio of undroppables, recently described how his manager’s decision‑making can feel like flip‑of-the-coin stuff.When the teamsheets are released an hour before kick-off at Wembley on Saturday, the eyeballs will jump towards the most intriguing selection dilemma: will Emery favourMarcus Rashfordor Ollie Watkins?Premier League and FA Cup semis: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreRashford, who lifted the FA Cup with Manchester United last season, has started seven of Villa’s past nine matches, scoring four goals. Watkins has begun three games across the same period, scoring twice, including the opening goalin the victory against Newcastleto move him level with Gabriel Agbonlahor on a record 74 Premier League goals for Villa. Emery has suggested he wants to experiment further with pairing Rashford and Watkins in attack, though he has not done so since Villa progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League withvictory against Club Bruggesix weeks ago.For Rashford, another start against Crystal Palace would be another big tick. His performance against Paris Saint-Germain at Villa Park, when he kickstartedthe comeback that put PSG on the ropesand almost fuelled one of the great European shocks, was undoubtedly his best showing in a Villa shirt. There was the dart inside Willian Pacho and Marquinhos before he sprung a stinging right-foot shot at Gianluigi Donnarumma. He was involved in the intricate move that led to Villa’s first goal, scored by Youri Tielemans, but the moment when he pressed pause, zipped the ball past Fabián Ruiz and skipped past Vitinha before teeing up Ezri Konsa to strike was a flashback to yesteryear. There were more glimpses of that menace on Tuesday at the Etihad Stadium, where he rattled a post inside 17 seconds and converted a cool penalty to add to his scoring record against Manchester City.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford put in his finest performance yet in an Aston Villa shirt against PSG.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersPerhaps it should be no surprise Rashford’s impact has been gradual. When he arrived at Villa in February he was lacking match fitness having started two United matches in the previous two months. All parties recognised it was pointless putting him in at the deep end. The 27-year-old requested to train on his first days off and last month pitched up at the local Midland League Division One side Sutton United for an individual session with the coach Jamie Reynolds. But after easing him in as planned, Emery has been impressed. “I am so, so happy with him,” Emery said. “He’s performing very well. Keep going – now Saturday, hopefully, he can help us again.”Emery has spoken about the smile that has returned to Rashford’s face at Villa. The pair are thought to have developed a good relationship and the forward was enthused about working with Emery after a friend and fellow player suggested the Spaniard was in the same bracket as Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger as an elite manager.Rashford, who gets on well with Konsa, Jacob Ramsey and Tyrone Mings, is thought to be living between Birmingham and his Cheshire base.After the slew of winter-window arrivals, Emery held a team meeting in which he outlined the state of play in various competitions, with Villa still fighting on three fronts at the time. Rashford was the headline arrival, even with Marco Asensio coming on loan from PSG. Axel Disasi signed from Chelsea, and Donyell Malen and Andrés García joined permanently. The other thing Emery made clear was that because there was more depth to the squad, rotation was inevitable given the weight of games and players could not afford to become demoralised.“If you’re not starting, we’ve not got time to care about it, in the sense that we’ve got places we want to get to,” Rogers said, explaining the message. Watkins has responded in the best way, impressing in a particularly dominant first-half displayagainst Nottingham Forestand scoring inside a minute on his last start, against Newcastle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tielemans, who scored a screamer to help Leicester win the Cup in 2021, has started 50 of Villa’s 52 matches, including every Premier League match, having been given the night off only in the early rounds of the Carabao Cup, against Wycombe and Palace. Emiliano Martínez and Rogers are not far behind with 48 starts. The 53rd game of the season could end with Villa in a firstFA Cupfinal since 2015.It remains to be seen whether the club intend to trigger the £40m option to sign Rashford, who has three years on his £375,000-a-week contract at United. For United, the Rashford conundrum has been Villa’s gain.His first goals came against Preston in the Cup quarter-finals, the first a simple finish, the other from the penalty spot. He has been in favour since. Rashford, who started both of England’s victories at Wembley in March, propelled Villa into a place of wonder against PSG. Can he do the same again on familiar ground?Explore more on these topicsMarcus RashfordAston VillaFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hearn, who promotes Benn, spoke of “a fight for the generations … an iconic main event … an incredible time for boxing” and urged us to “remember this night … this is what it’s all about.”Eubank Jris 35 years old and he has often campaigned as a super-middleweight at 168lb, which is 21lb heavier than the welterweight category in which Benn has mostly fought. He and Benn will now bridge the size-gap and meet as middleweights, but, on Friday morning, at the official weigh-in behind closed doors, Eubank Jr failed twice to make the 160 pound mark. While his second attempt was just 0.05lb (0.8 ounces) heavier than the contracted weight, Eubank Jr has been fined £375,000.He also faces a further test. Eubank Jr has to weigh in again on the morning of the fight and cannot scale more than an additional 10lb.Chris Eubank Jr silences Eddie Hearn and pledges to ‘take out’ Conor BennRead moreAfter a hard weight-cut, Eubank Jr could normally add at least 15lb before stepping into the ring the following night. But the rehydration clause, which compromises his recovery and allows the fight to gain a worrying edge, has been condemned in some quarters.Peter Hamlyn,the neurosurgeon who has saved the lives of multiple boxers, if not all from the harm of brain damage, has spoken of the risk and irresponsibility. Chris Eubank Sr haspleaded for the fight to be stopped. He has also cut ties with his son because of the weight stipulation and the fact that Junior’s antics have matched Benn’s spiteful insults.They were first meant to fight in October 2022 – but that contest was cancelled after Benn returnedtwo separate positive drug test results. Since then controversy and scandal have held sway. Benn has spent the intervening period ranting at the injustice he feels he has suffered while refusing to share the “scientific proof” which he insists clears him of intentional wrongdoing. He has also railed against Eubank Jr who has goaded him as “a cheat” andsplattered an egg against his face. Saturday will be Benn’s first UK fight in three years after the National Anti-Doping Panel concluded it was not satisfied an anti-doping violation had been proven and lifted a suspension last November.But the hard sell of an unpalatable fight has not caught fire yet. Even the heavy-handed Fatal Fury name given to the bout has been loaned from a promotionally linked gaming series that is far more popular than the battered old business of boxing. In a curiously flat fight week the commercial success might not be as clear-cut as has been previously suggested.The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is apparently sold out but this week it has been possible to buy fight tickets for as little as £24 on websites which can charge exorbitant prices for sporting events. At the same time the promoters have been giving away plenty of freebies, in the form of online competitions, as there are apparently enough spares that were not snapped up by the paying public. This might be canny marketing but it seems strange that a heavily hyped fight, meant to generate widespread interest outside hardcore boxing circles, should have so many tickets floating around.However, the rehydration restrictions and bitter arguments have lent a layer of intrigue as to what might happen when Eubank Jr and Benn are alone in the ring. Most boxing insiders have long believed that Eubank Jr should win clearly. He might fall just short of true world-class pedigree but he is the bigger man, with so much more experience than Benn.But over the past few days there has been a sudden swing of guesswork that the 28-year-old Benn could prevail against the odds. Whenever so many seasoned judges change their minds it’s worth pausing. The late backing of Benn seems to be based on gossip from sparring sessions, with Eubank Jr supposedly looking poor while Benn has apparently lit up the ring behind closed doors, and the abrupt realisation that age and weight might have humbled the favourite.View image in fullscreenConor Benn has been sparring impressively, according to some inside reports.Photograph: Mark Robinson/Matchroom BoxingEubank Jr has lost three times in 37 fights and those defeats have been to domestic rivals – Billy Joe Saunders, George Groves and Liam Smith. The last, in January 2023, was the most shocking. Eubank Jr’s iron jaw resembles his father’s but, against Smith, he was knocked down twice before the fight waswaved over in round four. It looked as if an ageing fighter was nearing the end of a bleak road.But Eubank Jrdominated the rematch nine months later. It emerged that Smith had various problems but, impressively, Eubank forced a 10th-round stoppage.Since then he has fought only once – a routine technical knockout of the Polish boxer, Kamil Szeremeta, in Riyadh. It meant that Eubank Jr had forced 10 knockdowns in his last three wins without resembling a devastating puncher. That anomaly might be another sign that age has drained Eubank Jr of his natural power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These were his last fights before he tested positive for clomifene, with the two separate results being recorded months apart.While he struggled to clear his name Benn staged an unconvincing comeback in America and won a couple of laboured decisions against the obscure Rodolfo Orozco and Peter Dobson. Now, it is claimed, he looks brilliant in the gym. He also appears much bigger and carries a burning intensity to hurt the man who has taunted him for so long.This injects some drama into the occasion but it should not be forgotten that we are watching two local rivals whose careers have battled to rise above decent competence. Those banging the drum have tried to make this sound like a British equivalent of the epic world middleweight fight between Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns which scorched the ring 40 years ago this month. But these fisticuffs are humdrum and even embarrassing in comparison.Chris Eubank Jr: ‘I shouldn’t be doing this. But we are the daredevils of sport’Read moreBoxing was once covered by great writers and social commentators. It is now a marginalised sport where its humble hacks are denied access to the fighters while they wait to hear if they will be granted accreditation. Those credentials can be withdrawn following criticism of Saudi Arabia or boxing’s power-brokers. The optics look petty when one of the world’s most visited and respected fight websites,BoxingScene, has been denied accreditation for the past four major events to which it has submitted applications, including this week in Tottenham. Some highly credible writers and editors are being shut out of boxing.It is also timely to remember how the promoters and many of the undercard fighters on Thursday thanked Turki al-Sheikh for brokering the bout. Sheikh heads the General Entertainment Authority which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars securing Saudi Arabia’s takeover of elite boxing.Twelve hours after Sheikh’s name was celebrated,the Athletic publisheda sobering six-month investigation into the reputation of the man revered in boxing as His Excellency. The allegations are serious, and apparently well-sourced. Sheikh did not respond to the claims made against him in the investigation.It is likely that boxing will fall silent in regard to this issue once the sound and fury, signifying nothing, fade after Eubank Jr and Benn leave the ring. It fits the desolate pattern of today’s fight business but, hey, as we keep being reminded, this is “an incredible time for boxing.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It came on the streets of Barcelona, where the 24-year-old Ugandan covered 13.1 miles in 56min 42sec – a half marathon time 48 seconds quicker than anyone else in history.Little more than two months later, Kiplimo is in London for his full marathon debut and the noise has only grown louder. Could he break the world record on Sunday? Could he even become the first man to break two hours in an official race? It is speculation that the event director, Hugh Brasher, is more than happy to stoke.“I think it’s going to be the most fascinating debut ever,” he says. “Is it feasible that he could take Kelvin Kiptum’s record as the fastest debutant? Without a doubt. Do I think he could one day be the athlete that runs under two hours? Yes. But let’s see what happens on Sunday.”‘It’s a step towards hope’: a refugee’s journey from wartorn Eritrea to the London MarathonRead moreKiplimo was regarded as a superstar in waiting even before he competed over 5,000m as a 15-year-old prodigy at the 2016 Rio Olympics. He had a humble upbringing on a farm in Kween, 1,500m above sea level on the Mount Elgon volcano. But, because his father had three wives, he had many older half-brothers to run with – including Robert Chemonges and Victor Kiplangat, both of whom have gone on to be sub 2hr 10min marathoners – and soon proved to be something special.“We were helping our brothers, the big brothers,” he says. “They were running and we kept seeing them when they were training. And one day, I tell them: ‘I want to become like you.’ So I just kept training, training. This was when I was around 10 or 11.”A few years later Kiplimo was spotted and brought to Italy to train for the 2016 Olympics. “Afterwards my coach, Giuseppe Giambrone, said to me: ‘You will be one of the greatest runners in the world,’” says Kiplimo. “It ended in the semi-finals. But it was a huge experience for me to be at the Olympics.”Kiplimo’s staggering performances as a 15-year-old included running the 5,000m in 13min 19.54sec and the 10,000m in 27:26.28 – all in the era before supershoes. But despite going on to win two senior world cross country titles as well as Olympic and world 10,000m bronze medals, his lack of a devastating sprint finish ended up hurting him on the track.On the roads it has so far been a different story. But on Sunday he faces the moment of truth against one of the greatestLondon Marathonfields ever assembled. It includes Eliud Kipchoge, the greatest of all time, the Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, last year’s winner Alexander Mutiso and the well-fancied Sabastian Sawe, a late bloomer at 30 who ran 2:02.05 to win the Valencia Marathon in December, the second-fastest debut in history. British eyes, meanwhile, will also be focused on Olympic triathlon gold medallist Alex Yee, who hopes to run around 2:09 in his debut over 26.2 miles.“I am ready to compete,” says Kiplimo, who reveals that he feels much stronger having gone from running around 75-90 miles a week during his track career to more like 125-135 for the marathon.View image in fullscreenJacob Kiplimo in action at the world cross country championships in 2024.Photograph: Đorđe Kojadinović/ReutersThe leading pack is likely to go through halfway in 61 minutes, giving scope for Kiplimo to run a negative split and chase down Kiptum’s world record of 2:00.35. A following wind for the second half of the race will help, although the forecast may be a little warm.When asked whether he could one day break two hours for the marathon, Kiplimo is cautious – at least for now. “Yes, of course,” he says. “Maybe in the future. But I’m just focusing on my debut. If this one goes well, then maybe I will be the guy to make it.”Inevitably, Kiplimo’s record-breaking times have aroused some suspicion – especially given the number of east Africans who have been caught doping over the past decade. In online forums, it is also noted that his agents, Rosa and Associati, have had previous clients test positive for EPO – including the 2016 Olympic marathon champion, Jemima Sumgong, and Rita Jeptoo, who won twice in Boston.Those cases led toFrederico Rosa being investigated by the Kenyan governmentin 2016, before all charges were dropped. Afterwards, Rosa’s lawyer insisted that the government did “not have an iota of evidence against my client” and Kiplimo promises that he and his team can be trusted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For me, I can’t say nothing about doping, but I train myself. And I believe in my training. They give us a lot of advice. They tell us, in case of anything, you have to write everything down that you are taking. Some athletes want shortcuts. But for us we keep following the programme.”“Can we trust you and believe in you?” he is asked.“Yes, of course,” comes the reply.“A man that has run 56.42 for a half marathon?”“Yes, of course.”Kiplimo’s answers were as emphatic as he hopes his performance will be on Sunday. He is particularly excited to face Kipchoge, who he helped pace to a sub two-hour marathon in Vienna in 2019, albeit in a race which didn’t qualify for a world record under WorldAthleticsrules.“I remember 2019, when I was pacing Kipchoge,” he says. “So for me it is a little bit amazing to compete with one of the greatest runners in history.” And, he hopes, to make some more history of his own.Explore more on these topicsLondon MarathonAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The head coach admits his team have “a big responsibility” to deliver at Anfield given the club’s last Premier League triumph, in 2020, came behind closed doors during the Covid pandemic. Slot’s family will be in attendance, although he says their visit was planned months ago to coincide with a public holiday in the Netherlands.Liverpool have dominated the Premier League season, never relinquishing first place after returning to the top on 2 November and embarking on a 26-game unbeaten run that rendered a title race obsolete. Yet Slot insists they have resembled his ideal team only occasionally, and that they must and will improve next season.Premier League and FA Cup semis: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“Every manager around the world wants to achieve perfection and that will probably never work out,” Slot said. “But even in the last few weeks we are still trying to get better in certain things and keeping the standards as high as we had them for the whole season. Maybe in some parts of the season or in phases of some games we were quite close [to his vision of what a Slot team should be] but in other moments we have to do much better. We can definitely improve.“In general every manager that works at a top club wants to have control of a game, every single minute of the game, but that is hardly possible in this league. There were phases also during the season or during games where we didn’t have that control, so I think we have to become even better … The positive thing from us this season is that we never went down a lot, even if we didn’t have the control I would like. We were still difficult to score against but a bit more ball possession and threatening the opponent even more would be good.”Slot, grounded as ever, insists he has not contemplated what it would mean to win the title in his first season at Liverpool, his place in Anfield folklore or what the celebrations could be like on Sunday. Asked whether he was aware that he was an inch from becoming a Liverpool legend, the 46-year-old replied: “Yes, but I prefer to get my mind on that inch and not on what happens afterwards because there is still an inch to be done.”He said: “We have to do the job. But of course it gives us a lot of confidence the way we have played all the way through the season in sometimes difficult circumstances as well. We’ve always shown up, not only us but the fans as well. I have all the confidence we will show up again, but I also know how unpredictable a game of football can be. That’s why we have to be so well prepared.”Slot is acutely aware of what it will mean to the supporters to win the league, even though opportunities to interact are rare. “Sometimes when I’m driving on the motorway they come up right next to you for 500m or a kilometre and [punches the air],” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wakelin hit breaks of 119, 71 and 75 as his opponent failed to pot a ball for three frames, immediately heading to the practice table at the interval.Sports quiz of the week: Jamie Vardy, Faith Kipyegon and Ben YoungsRead moreIn the next frame, Allen sank a long red to end his drought and quickly manoeuvred his way to a maximum chance. After potting 15 reds and 15 blacks, the world No 8 almost snookered himself behind the blue, but was able to dispatch the yellow – and a tricky pink – before rolling in the final black to huge cheers.Allen’s 147 is the first at the Crucible since 2023, when Mark Selby and Kyren Wilson both achieved the feat. His is the 15th maximum to be made at the world championship, and will earn him a £40,000 prize money bonus.

But the 76-year-old, whose son Eddie is the Matchroom chairman, has called on Sheffield city council to expand the venue or face losing the event.“It’s black and white: we love the Crucible, we love Sheffield, but the Crucible and Sheffield have got to love us,” Hearn, the former chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association told BBC Radio 5 Live.“We want to stay but the financials have to be taken into consideration. The facilities where the Crucible is are no longer fit for purpose, that’s the key issue. The Crucible’s been a big part of my life and a big part of snooker’s life. But it has to move with the times and someone, whether it’s government or Sheffield, have to come up with a way of showing us that they’re going to treat us with respect and give us the type of facilities we require. It’s as simple as that.“Maybe we should take this worldwide. Maybe it should be one year in Beijing, one year in Saudi and one year in Sheffield. We have to move with the times,” Hearn added. “I’m concerned with increasing the prize money as we have done with darts. Snooker needs to be more commercially viable.”Hearn warned: “The contract period ends in 2027 and we need a decision soon. We want to stay in Sheffield, so show me the way.”Last week the WST, Sheffield city council and Sheffield Theatres said that due to the “sensitive and commercial nature of these ongoing discussions”, no announcement would be made during this year’s event.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookerSheffieldnewsShareReuse this content"

Nuclear power was a point of common ground for some countries at the summit, including France.Photograph: Robert Pratta/ReutersEnergySix things we learned about the future of energy security at UK summitCritical minerals, nuclear power and the ‘weaponisation’ of energy supplies were discussed at international conferenceFiona HarveyEnvironment editorFri 25 Apr 2025 14.32 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 16.43 EDTShareThe UK and the International Energy Agency gathered ministers and high-level officials from 60 countries to Lancaster House inLondonfor two days of talks on the future of energy security this week. The EU was out in force, the US sent a top official, but China stayed away. Here’s what we learned.Energy security is national securityThough the geopolitical chasms between the US, China, Europe and Russia, and the gap between the rich world and the global south, yawned as wide as ever, there was one thing that all countries could agree on: having secure and reliable supplies of energy is a top priority for everyone, and those supplies are growing more insecure.“Energy security is national security,” declared Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, and none of the warring parties disagreed. Without energy security, modern societies and modern economies cannot function. Where countries have different ideas is on how to secure those energy supplies.Starmer made clear that he sees the UK’s future in terms of clean, low-carbon energy. In a sharp rebuttal to critics of net zero, in other parties and within Labour, he made astriking commitment to “accelerate” the push to decarbonise power. It was an unmistakable vote of confidence in Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, who has been the subject of unfriendly briefings from sections of his own party.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband, the UK energy secretary, and Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, at the summit in London.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/EPAFossil fuels are not the answer – unless you are the USOne of the key themes brought up by delegates from Europe, the developing world and others, was the “weaponisation” of energy supplies in conflict, particularly byRussia in its invasion of Ukraine.Russia’s control of gas supplies sent prices of fossil fuels soaring, and inflation followed, generating a cost of living calamity with widespread pain for the less well-off around the world, and political crises for the parties in power in numerous countries.For the vast majority of countries at the conference, the lesson was to seek alternatives to fossil fuel energy. That has the added bonus of tackling the climate crisis, which is itsown source of geopolitical tension and looming planetary disaster.But petro states, and fossil fuel companies, werewell-represented among the 60 countries and 50 global companies present. The US was the most vocal supporter of fossil fuels. Tommy Joyce, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, hushed a plenary session when he declared that the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 was “harmful and dangerous”, and warned of “putting abstract emission goals in the interests of our adversaries first and the security of our people last”.China sees acting on climate as another way of building international relationshipsXi Jinping, the president of China, chose a small closed-door meeting of 18 world leaders convened by the UN on Tuesday to makehis biggest international intervention on the climate in several years. In pointed remarks, in which he did not mention the US or Donald Trump by name, he said: “Although some major country’s persistent pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism has seriously impacted international rules and the international order … as long as we enhance confidence, solidarity and cooperation, we will overcome the headwinds and steadily move forward global climate governance and all progressive endeavours of the world.”He sought to position China as a protector of developing countries, and a climate leader on the world stage. He vowed that China would “not slow down its climate actions”, and boasted that the country had “built the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy systems as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain”.China did not send a delegate to the London conference, which may have been of some help in ensuring the US was present.Andreas Sieber, associate director of global policy at the campaign group 350.org, said: “This is a major breakthrough … The question now is not whether China will act, but how far it is willing to go.”View image in fullscreenDelegates at an opening session on day two of the energy summit at Lancaster House.Photograph: Kin Cheung/PANuclear is a point of common ground for some countriesFatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, spent much of the conference emphasising that energy security was about all sources of energy. He was at particular pains to insist that oil and gas would be “part of the energy mix for years to come”.But he also had warm words for nuclear power. Despite its cost and the difficulties of building nuclear plants, not to mention the physical security of those plants and the problems of dealing with radioactive waste, nuclear power is attractive to many governments. This is because it offers baseload power generation, which can help to balance electricity grids with a high input from intermittent sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar.France has one of the world’s most highly developed nuclear power industries. Marc Ferracci, the energy minister, waseager to talk about the advantages. “Nuclear is still very attractive,” he said. “The cost can be high in the short run, but in the long run it provides dispatchability and baseload. It makes the electricity system more resilient, and that resilience is very important.”Milibandsingled out nuclear as one of the areas of “common ground” on energy and climate policy between the UK and the US.US rejection of climate policy could divert investment elsewhereDonald Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement and has been disrupting the renewable energy industry, calling a halt to an offshore windfarm off the coast of New York earlier this month, and threatening more action to stifle projects. Meanwhile, he is boosting fossil fuels.But there could beopportunities for other countries, which are open for business on renewable energy and seeking investors. On the eve of the summit, Starmer said: “Let my message to the world go out: come and build the clean energy future in Britain.”While he was not taking aim at the US, investors shunned in one major economy will have little difficulty in seeing where their capital will be welcomed.Critical minerals really are criticalEveryone wants to talk about critical minerals, the blanket term for metals andso-called “rare earth” elementsthat are essential to building clean and low-carbon technologies, from wind turbines and electric car batteries to solar panels and electricity grids. Critical minerals include a wide range of materials, including lithium and cobalt, more exotic sounding elements such as yttrium and scandium, and more common metals such as nickel and copper.Some of these elements are rare and others relatively common, but what unites them is increasing demand whilesourcing such materials is growing more difficult and costly, and processing them is often concentrated in the hands of a small number of specialist operations. China has a stranglehold on this market, processing 60% to 80% of the global supply of some of these materials.Joyce, the US delegate, warned “there are no alternatives” to China in sourcing critical minerals, urging countries to stick to oil and gas instead.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told a closed-door meeting at the conference that securing the supply chain of components for clean energy – from solar panels to electric vehicles – was the next challenge for decarbonising the planet. “The next mission of the Global Clean Power Alliance [agrouping spearheaded by the UK] addresses the need for resilient, secure, and low-cost clean energy supply chains. These vital chains are concentrated in a few markets, creating barriers to investment and limiting economic benefits. The responsibility rests on all our shoulders to lift these barriers.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyRenewable energyEnergy industryNuclear powerEd MilibandLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

Obviously, there are some differences, but there is also common ground.”He added: “The US is interested in a nuclear renaissance, in building new nuclear as part of its energy mix. So is the UK, in small as well as large scale nuclear. Part of our job is to find that common ground, to work together with the US on these issues.”He also hinted at possible future cooperation ongeothermal power.The Guardian understands that although Miliband did not have a formal bilateral meeting with Joyce, an acting assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, they chatted informally at a dinner held on Thursday night. Donald Trump haswithdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement,attacked renewable powerandboosted the production of fossil fuels.Joyce also made it clear that the US wanted to export more gas, though the Guardian understands potential deals with the UK were not discussed in the chat with Miliband.Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, warned that all countries must “take a multilateral approach” to energy, in the interests of their own national security.“If you’re an exporter, you have to have an importer – no country is an energy island,” he said. “So there is a need for cooperation.”Britain will accelerate push to net zero, Starmer tells energy summitRead moreMiliband also saidattacks on the goal of reaching net zerogreenhouse gas emissions by 2050 had failed to dent the government’s clean energy and climate ambitions.“Whether it is political parties or other forces that want to take on net zero and the clean energy transition, they need to know this government is not for bending,” he said. “This government is not for buckling. This government is standing firm. And you know what, I think the British people are on that side.”Some renewable energy industry insiders believe recent US actions – Trump abruptlyordered a halt to a major offshore wind project in New Yorkand has threatened further disruption to renewables – are driving away green investors whomay seek a safe haven in the UK.Explore more on these topicsEnergyRenewable energyEnergy industryNuclear powerEd MilibandDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It faces mounting criticism about its preparations for an international conference that is on a far greater scale than anything previously seen in the rainforest region.A shortage of beds has driven hotel prices so high that the federal government hasthreatened to prosecute price-gougers. Traffic congestion, already bad, is expected to become horrific with theexpected influx of 50,000 visitors during the event. Conservation groups have beenshocked by the clearance of forests for new highwaysand there is scepticism that the city’s infrastructure projects, including a doubling of the airport’s capacity, will be ready in time.But in an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the Pará state governor, Helder Barbalho – who says he asked PresidentLuiz Inácio Lula da Silvain November 2022 to nominate Belém as host – said everything was on track. “All the projects that were planned and structured will be ready so that we can hold a fantastic event in November,” he said.He insisted the event will be worthwhile to improve the lives of city residents and for civil society to finally be given a voice after three consecutive Cops in autocratic nations. Barbalho said: “We understand that it will be the Cop with the greatest popular participation in history and that is something we have particularly encouraged.”Belém is already a hive of construction activity, though critics claim the benefits are mainly for real estate developers and major corporations, while there is little effort to reduce economic inequality in the urban peripheries or integrate nature into urban planningMask-wearing welders are illuminated by blue sparks at the Parque da Cidade, a former airport that will stage the main conference centre. Signs say the work here is being carried out by Brazil’s biggest mining company, Vale, which has been responsible for some of the country’s deadliest and most environmentally destructive disasters, includingthe 2019 collapse of the Brumadinho tailings dam, which killed 272 people.Close to the colonial-era Cidade Velha – or old town – district, a new urban park is under construction between a complex of middle-class high rises and a swanky redevelopment of old warehouses that are now upmarket restaurants selling an extraordinary range of fish dishes and ice-creams made from regional fruits. The most striking feature of the new concrete space are several dozen “eco-trees” made from recycled steel bars that branch out into canopy-like supports for pots full of hanging plants.This proved controversial when a city officialadmitted the designs were copied from Singaporefor shade because Belém is warming rapidly and there was not enough good soil in this area to plant real trees.It confirmed what people could see and feel. Belém was once known as the city of mango trees, but has experienced a dramatic loss of urban vegetation over the past 20 years. This process has been compounded by the Cop30-accelerated expansion of two new roads – Avenida Liberdade and Rua da Marinha – that together resulted in the clearance of more than 100 hectares (247 acres) of vegetation.Ana Claudia Cardoso, a professor of urbanism at the Federal University of Pará, predicted Belém would have less tree cover in the city after Cop than it did before.View image in fullscreenBelém city centre.Photograph: Adriano Machado/ReutersBarbalho said the road improvements had been planned two years before the Cop bid and were built to high environmental standards with walls on either side to prevent roadkill and high numbers of dedicated animal crossings. He said it would reduce traffic jams and their associated carbon emissions.He preferred to focus on the bigger picture: that Pará – long a centre of Amazon destruction – is now at the forefront of efforts to reduce deforestation, which halved between 2018 and 2024. “We had the courage to build a new history,” he said, also stressingefforts to reforest faster than any other state in Brazil, secure the majority of carbon credits, initiate a cattle-tracing programme and build a “bioeconomy” by investing in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to replace cattle ranching.Such talk – and his willingness to work with Lula, the Workers’ party president – makes Barbalho an exception among the governors of Amazonian states, almost all of whom are far-right Bolsonarists. But he shares similar extractivist roots, owning more than 6,000 cattle and shares in a ranchamong his listed assetsof 18.75m real (£2.48m) in 2022.The scion of the most powerful dynasty in the state (his father is a senator, media tycoon and landowner) is known as “the king of the north” and widely believed to be building his global reputation for a future bid for the presidency.Many on the left distrust Barbalho and say he overstates his achievements, which are more to do with federal policies. But there is grudging respect for his intelligence, ability to secure such a prestigious global meeting, and promise to support civil society.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Many see this as hypocrisy from the global north, which is now much more of a threat to multilateralism because conflict is worsening, rich countries have failed to provide sufficient climate finance, and Donald Trump has begun pulling the US out of the Paris agreement.Caetano Scannavino, the coordinator of the Health and Happiness Project in the Amazon, said: “More than just logistics, these are gigantic challenges for Brazil in exercising the mandate that the world gave us to lead the negotiations until November 2025. We are about to lose the battle of the 1.5C goal [of limiting global heating above preindustrial levels] of Paris, and the only consensus among the nations that claim to be leaders of humanity – the US, China, Russia and Europe – is to put more money into buying weapons.”View image in fullscreenIndigenous and environmental activists hold out a banner to pressurise leaders to phase out fossil fuels.Photograph: Eraldo Peres/APAmid the collapsing consensus, the Brazilian chair of Cop30, ambassador André Aranha Corrêa do Lago, has proposed an agenda for governments that steers clear of contentious issues. Instead,he has called on civil societyto take the lead in applying pressure.Indigenous communities have been promised a more prominent role both in the official conference venue and at a parallel four-day “people’s summit” in the university grounds that is expected to draw about 15,000 participants from traditional communities, NGOs and academia. Several demonstrations are planned, the biggest of which will be a march during the middle weekend of the conference.But there is a risk in raising expectations for protests and public meetings. Without clear mechanisms and authority for civil society to influence the official debate, protesters may feel frustrated that they are involved in little more than grandstanding. Given the Brazilian police’s widespread support for Bolsonaro and tendency to resort to teargas and violence at public gatherings, there are concerns that street conflicts could further undermine prospects for a global consensus.Barbalho said the organisers would be well prepared to avoid problems. Security is being coordinated by the federal government, who have organised a national committee with representatives from the armed forces and police. Seven hundred members of Pará’s military police are receiving special training.Some veteran activists are wary but determined. Eunice Guedes of the Brazilian Women’s Articulation said: “We are concerned that the city will be militarised and that the exclusion zone will be large. We have been talking to the city hall of Belém to define its size. Security is a concern.”But most talk of their hopes for a festive spirit, a long-term shift in local policies and a chance to show a different – and urban – side of the rainforest.Mariana Guimarães, a Belém-based environmentalist and international political adviser to the Cop30 civil society committee, said she was looking forward to challenging preconceptions – for better or for worse. She said: “I think it’s an opportunity not just for the world to know the Amazon, but also for Brazil to know the Amazon, because we understand that there are a lot of these stereotypes of what the region is, right?“Many people will come here thinking they will enter a dense forest and all that, and they will see that there will be no real trees here in Belém. Visitors will get to know another Amazon, get to know our culture, definitely enjoy the food that we have, the music and everything else.”Explore more on these topicsCop30BrazilLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaAmericasClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The scent of wood is unmistakable, and signs of the material can be spotted everywhere – from glulam (glued laminated timber) columns and beams in the building’s frame to cross-laminated timber (CLT) slabs in the floors, ceilings and staircases. CLT, made by gluing together layers of planed wood into panels, offers strength and rigidity comparable to concrete but is significantly lighter and quicker to build with.“It’s a fantastic working environment – no concrete dust, no silica dust issues. It’s clean and quiet,” said Niklas Häggström, the project area manager at Atrium Ljungberg, and responsible for the realisation of the entire Wood City project, when we walk around the site. In total, 25 neighbourhoods will cover 25 hectares. The first buildings are scheduled for completion in 2025, with the next phase – including 2,000 homes – planned for 2027. It is an enormous project, but with timber Atrium Ljungberg can build 1,000 sq metres a week. With concrete, it manages half that.View image in fullscreenCGI of a balcony in Sickla where 2,000 homes are planned for 2027.In 2022 Atrium Ljungberg set an ambitious goal to become climate neutral by 2030. Just by choosing timber as the structural material, the company has said it reduces its climate impact by about 40%, a claim backed up byresearchers at Linköping University. And that is before factoring in energy systems and reuse strategies. One goal, for example, is to reuse 20% of materials in tenant adaptations, refurbishments and new-builds. According to Angela Berg, its business area director, shifting from concrete to timber is not just a technical change – it is a mindset shift. “It shapes the whole city experience: from the facade materials to the greenery, to how people interact with their environment. It’s not about entering a building and seeing wood, it’s about feeling the difference everywhere,” she said.If other companies were to follow suit,one study foundthat building with wood instead of concrete and steel in 80% of new buildings would help offset half of Europe’s construction industry emissions. Another study found that wooden buildingscontinue to be climate friendly– a four-storey wooden building results in a net uptake of 150 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is possible because the wood stores the CO2absorbed by the growing trees. (The analysis takes into account the energy used in wood production, transport and the construction of the building.)While each building will have a different character, wood will permeate the city inside and out, said Oskar Norelius, an architect at White Arkitektur who has worked with Atrium Ljungberg on the project. “It shouldn’t be something you discover only when you walk in. The timber should be part of the experience from the street.”The hope is that the city will also improve the wellbeing of the people inside the buildings. “Wood regulates indoor humidity, creating a naturally comfortable climate throughout the year. Beyond that, studies show that visible timber has psychological benefits – it reduces stress, helps children concentrate better, and even supports faster recovery in patients. These effects carry over into offices and homes too.”View image in fullscreenMulti-storey wooden apartment blocks have been made possible by changes to Sweden’s building regulations.Norelius recently worked on Sara cultural centre in Skellefteå, which is the Nordic region’stallest timber building to datewith 20 storeys, putting the city on the map as a global pioneer. “While other countries often have the knowledge, they haven’t implemented it at scale like Sweden has,” he said. The fact that 70% of the country is covered in woodland has supported a long tradition of building in wood.Before 1994 Swedish building codes restricted the use of wood in buildings over two storeys, mainly due to fire safety concerns. But when the country revised its building regulations, materials were no longer explicitly banned; instead buildings had to meet functional demands for fire safety, structural stability and sound insulation. Wood could now be used in multi-storey buildings if they met safety standards. It also led to the increased use and further development of engineered wood products such as CLT and glulam.In recent years, other Scandinavian countries have followed suit, including Wood City in the Jätkäsaari district of Helsinki, which consist of a series of multi-storey buildings completed in 2021, and the 18-storey Mjøstårnet in Brumunddal, Norway, which is the country’s third-tallest building, finished in 2019. Other examples around the world include Gaia, a wooden campus in Singapore that opened in 2023, and an eight-storey housing block in Seattle, which opened the same year. In Sydney, Atlassian Headquarters, a wooden retail and office space, claims it will be the “tallest commercial hybrid timber tower in the world” when completed.View image in fullscreenA planned housing development in Sickla. The architects say timber ‘should be part of the experience from the street’.But despite the race to build sustainably, there have been conflicting interests between forestry, biodiversity, recreation and climate concerns in Sweden in recent years. While someargue the country should not harvest forests at all, others believe that managed forestry is beneficial for carbon capture. “Over time, it leads to more growth and more carbon stored,” said Erik Serrano, a professor in structural mechanics at Lund University. “If you can meet the same technical requirements of load-bearing, fire safety, moisture, acoustics, then wood has a clear advantage because it comes from a natural cycle. It’s a zero-sum game in terms of carbon dioxide over its lifecycle. What’s important is that we use wood for long-lived products as much as possible. If we store carbon in buildings for 100 or 200 years, we delay emissions significantly – that’s a major effect.”In Sickla, Häggström stops by a window facing the Marcusplatsen square, and describes how Wood City will be self-sufficient on electricity thanks to a geothermal energy system. There are two birch trees right outside the window that have been left untouched – a seemingly mundane detail – but Häggström explains that it is part of a larger strategy.“We had the option to remove the trees and plant new ones, but we chose to keep them – even though it cost us an extra £20,000,” he said. “We felt the existing trees were part of the place’s identity. It’s not just about building sustainably – it’s about creating a place people want to be in.” By building in timber and showing the reduced carbon impact, he believes pressure is put on the concrete industry to innovate. “They see the carbon numbers, they see what’s possible, and they have to respond. And that’s a good thing. This project isn’t just a school – it’s part of pushing the whole sector forward.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesArchitectureEthical and green livingConstruction industrySwedenEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The statements relate to the background to the deletion of millions of internal NGN emails.One officer, Sue Akers, a former deputy assistant commissioner in the force, said it appeared that NGN sought to “actively frustrate the police inquiry and undermine our ability to carry out a thorough investigation”, it is claimed.According to the high court document, she further claimed that if she had been aware of certain internal discussions at NGN, she would have “launched an investigation into the matter terminating all contact with [NGN’s general manager] Will Lewis, who would have been a suspect in respect of the deletions”.A second officer in the inquiry, which was called Operation Weeting, also referred to Lewis.Barney Ratcliffe, a retired detective inspector, “also confirms he would have terminated contact with Will Lewis as a suspect and considered arresting him for perverting the course of justice”, it is claimed.Lewis has previously strongly denied wrongdoing. He did not comment when approached by the Guardian.NGN strenuously denied the allegations, saying that its executives acted with integrity. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded in 2015 that there was no evidence that company email deletions were carried out to pervert the course of justice.The claims from the former detectives are contained in a document filed with the high court in London in support of what was a long-running and hotly disputed phone-hacking litigation pursued against NGN byPrince Harryand the former deputy leader of the Labour party, Tom Watson.The “skeleton arguments” were not made public at the time and the claims not tested at trial because the case was settled out of court in January, with a reported payout in excess of £10m in damages and legal fees in favour of the prince and Lord Watson.NGN also offered a full and unequivocal apology to Harry for phone hacking by journalists at its Sunday tabloid, the News of the World, and the “serious intrusion by the Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life, including incidents of unlawful activities carried out by private investigators working for the Sun”.No admissions were made about a further allegation of the illegal destruction of evidence, which NGN strongly denied and which a spokesperson said that they would have fought at trial.The Guardian is able to report for the first time from the skeleton arguments after the parties agreed to provide them following an application to high court judge, Mr Justice Fancourt.The detectives’ statements relate to the background to the deletion of millions of internal NGN emails, including in late January and early February 2011.Lewis, who was involved in the deletion policy, was also tasked with liaising with police officers at the launch of their investigation into alleged phone hacking at the News of the World. The paper was subsequently closed because of the scandal.In its skeleton defence, NGN strenuously rejected allegations of a cover-up. A spokesperson stated that there was a lack of contemporaneous evidence in support of the claimants’ case and that NGN had a strong a lineup of witnesses who could confirm their own position.According to the NGN skeleton argument, the deletion of emails had been “long been in the planning, for sound commercial, IT and practical reasons”, and Harry and Watson’s claims in this area had drawn on “wholly unreasonable inferences from an incomplete account of the facts, many of which are taken entirely out of context”.A previously unseen note from a third police officer in the summer of 2011 in which he recognised that a contractor working for NGN had failed to carry out back-up operations ordered by the company is cited in its defence skeleton.An NGN spokesperson said Akers and Ratcliffe’s statements were a “selective and partial consideration of the contemporaneous documents”.The spokesperson said: “NGN once again strenuously denies that there was any plan to delete emails in order to conceal evidence from a police investigation.“Operation Weeting … was initiated in January 2011 after NGN handed incriminating material it had discovered to the Met police (MPS). From the first meeting held between NGN and the MPS, the MPS were made aware of the steps NGN had taken in relation to its historic email archive as well as the actions it had taken to preserve relevant evidence.“NGN then worked alongside specialist IT officers at the MPS for months to reconstruct its electronic archives and those specialist officers rightly concluded that there was no deliberate attempt to destroy evidence.”The spokesperson added: “Both during and following the criminal proceedings, the MPS and the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] considered the actions of News International, including whether certain conduct amounted to perverting the course of justice.“The allegations of email deletion had formed part of the prosecution case in the criminal trial in 2013-14. The investigation into News International concluded in 2015, almost 10 years ago, with a lengthy statement by the CPS deciding that no further action was to be taken in the light of there being no evidence to support an allegation of wrongdoing.”Campaigners continue to demand that the Met and prosecutors look again at the allegations of destruction of evidence, with Watson pledging on the steps of the high court to provide Scotland Yard with a dossier of evidence that supported a further investigation.It is accepted by both parties that NGN discovered three incriminating emails providing evidence of phone hacking at the News of the World on 6 January 2011.NGN handed these to the Met on 26 January. NGN claimed that its executives then acted responsibly in liaising with the police while carrying out long-planned email deletions that were necessary due to the frailty of their old systems.Harry and Watson argued that instead a “concealment and destruction plan was devised” following a meeting between executives, including Lewis, [NGN chief executive] Rebekah Brooks and [NGN lawyer] Tom Crone.This is denied. The company spokesperson said that “the evidence demonstrates unequivocally the repeated concern of those involved to back up data and preserve potentially relevant evidence in the face of an old and failing system”.The claim from Harry and Watson goes on to allege that data from the email archive had also been deleted because of a “so-called security threat” that was said to involve Watson, then a Labour MP, seeking to purchase stolen NGN emails on the orders of Gordon Brown.“It was obviously baseless and a bad excuse for deleting evidence”, Harry and Watson claimed.NGN has apologised to Watson as part of the settlement of this case, on the grounds that the company now “understand that this information was false”.The company has said that it believed that the threat was genuine at the time and that it would have proved this at trial.In its defence skeleton, NGN cites an email from Brooks, not previously made public.Writing after she had read a Daily Telegraph article in January 2011 that suggested that Watson had some knowledge of the structures of the company’s IT systems, Brooks wrote: “I am worried about this. I know its bollo but clearly something wrong in internal security. How do I investigate it … ”NGN’s skeleton defence also noted that a range of security measures were subsequently taken. The company also refers to a letter sent in January 2011 by Watson to then Met assistant commissioner John Yates, disclosed ahead of trial. In it Watson claimed to have been approached by former company employees with “knowledge of the information technology arrangements of News International”, NGN claimed.A Met spokesperson said: “While we acknowledge that information emerging from civil proceedings is of interest to the public and the press who may be seeing it for the first time, in the vast majority of cases it is material that has already been considered as part of the numerous investigations and reviews that have previously been carried out.“We are aware that parties in this recent case indicated an intention to pass material to us but we are yet to receive any such correspondence. In the event that we do, we will consider it carefully and proportionally, recognising the need to explore genuine lines of enquiry but acknowledging the significant resources already committed to past investigations.”Explore more on these topicsPhone hackingNational newspapersNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesPress intrusionPrince HarryTom WatsonnewsShareReuse this content"

M&S said customers did not need to take any action, indicating that their details had not been accessed.Shares in the retailer fell by as much as 4% on Friday after the announcement, before easing to close 2.3% down, making it one of the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100.Just over a third of M&S’s clothing and homeware sales are made online and the forced stop in orders comes before a busy weekend period and expected heatwave that is likely to spur demand for clothing and kit for outdoor entertaining.The cyber incident began on Monday, affecting contactless payments and click-and-collect orders in stores across the UK. However, there was a separate technical problem on the Saturday of the busy Easter weekend that affected only contactless payments.M&S has hired cybersecurity experts to help investigate and manage the problem and said it was taking actions to further protect the network to ensure it could continue serving shoppers.Security experts warned shoppers to watch out for scammers capitalising on the high profile incident.Nicholas Found, the head of commercial content at Retail Economics, said: “The cyber-attack on Marks & Spencer is a stark reminder that no retailer, no matter how established or digitally sophisticated, is immune from the escalating threat of cybercrime.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Two months before he was fatally shot, he walked into a police station armed with a knife and asked to be arrested, in an apparent desperate attempt to get help.One line of inquiry at any subsequent inquest into the death may be whether Joyce had wanted to die at the hands of police.On Friday, the Independent Office for Police Conduct released new findings from its continuing investigation.Joyce was shot once in the abdomen on 1 April outside the station. Thames Valley police said officers were called to reports of a man armed with a gun, but after the shooting no gun was found.The IOPC said Joyce, who lived in Milton Keynes but was originally from Galway, Ireland, had a 12cm steak knife when he came face to face with armed officers outside the station.Using CCTV footage recovered from the scene, and matching it with timings of the call received by police about a man with a gun, IOPC investigators believe it was Joyce himself who called the emergency number.The IOPC said: “Police had been alerted following a 999 call from a man reporting that ‘there is a man with a gun down at the train station in Milton Keynes’.“The call handler rang back after the caller hung up during the call and spoke to the man again who said the man with the gun was acting suspiciously, looked like he was about to do something bad and ‘definitely’ had a gun.“Records show that the mobile phone number used to make the 999 call had been used to call police before and was linked to Mr Joyce. CCTV footage shows Mr Joyce making a phone call at a time, which matches with when the 999 call to police was made.“[Joyce] was armed with a steak knife with a 12cm blade, when he ran at two officers. He was then shot at close range by an officer from a Thames Valley police armed response unit, which was first on the scene.”Joyce had been released from prison earlier this year after being jailed for firearms and weapons offences.On 4 February he walked into a Milton Keynes police station with a knife and asked to be arrested.The incident was first reported by theMilton Keynes Citizen.A Thames Valley police spokesperson said: “At around 6.25pm on 4 February, David Joyce attended Milton Keynes police station with a knife, asking to be arrested. An officer told Mr Joyce to drop the knife and he handed it to the officer. Mr Joyce was arrested and then detained under section 136 of the Mental Health Act.”The IOPC said of its investigation: “All officers who attended the incident remain as witnesses … as there is no indication that any of them may have committed a criminal offence or breached police professional standards of behaviour.”A full inquest into Joyce’s death will take place after the IOPC investigation.Explore more on these topicsMilton KeynesPoliceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump predictably chose the top of Trump Towers for his stunt.Raising funds and global awareness for motor neurone disease, or ALS as it’s known in America, the craze even caught on among those of us without a personal pool or glamorous garden – with schoolteachers and pupils, police officers and nurses taking part.The challenge involved pouring a bucket of ice-cold water over your head, posting the video on social media and nominating someone else to complete the challenge or donate to charity, or both. More than 17 million people took part across the world.It raised an estimated $220m (£165m) forcharities fighting to find a curefor the progressive disease that attacks the motor nerves causing muscle weakness and wasting.Now, the Ice Bucket Challenge is back: resuscitated by a group of US college students who lost two friends to suicide, using the hashtag #SpeakYourMIND to raise mental health awareness. The hashtag has already been shared thousands of times, raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for the cause.“The original Ice Bucket Challenge was a turning point for our charity,” said Richard Evans, the director of engagement for the Motor Neurone Disease (MND) Association. “It ignited the fight against MND and gave us a new benchmark for fundraising. Every year since the challenge, we’ve increased fundraising: last year, we raised £37.9m – more than we’ve ever raised before.”Speaking about the decision to revive the challenge, Wade Jefferson, a student at the University of South Carolina and founder of the college’s Mind (Mental Illness Needs Discussion) club, said: “It started as a random idea, inspired by the original ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and how powerful that movement was.”As with the previous phenomenon, the movement is gaining traction first in the US: the formerNFLplayers Peyton Manning, Emmanuel Sanders, James Charles and Haley Baylee have already participated. Carson Daly, a host of Today, dumped a bowl of ice water onJenna Bush Hagerin a segment earlier this week.“Watching it take off – seeing people we admire, likePeyton Manning, join in – has been surreal. We’re proud, grateful, and just excited to see how far it’s gone and continues to go,” said Jefferson.“Just as the original Ice Bucket Challenge did for ALS, this version is turning awareness into action. Beyond the buckets and the contagious videos, it’s about breaking stigma, building community and making mental health a visible, valued part of everyday conversation.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump joins in at the top of Trump Tower.Photograph: TwitterThe new challenge has already raised more than Jefferson dreamed of: originally aiming to raise $500 (£372), the campaign raised more than £142,000 in a few days. Active Minds then set a new goal of $250,000 (£187,048) – but by Friday, about$338,000had already been donated.Some have, however, thrown cold water on the new challenge, citing concerns about participating in a mental health movement tied to receiving a nomination from someone on social media – which could leave some feeling left out if they don’t hear their name called.But Jefferson said there was more to the challenge than taking part. “Participants are encouraged to share educational resources – including self-care tools, ways to offer help and information to access crisis support – available atactiveminds.org,” he said. “Together, we’re not just starting a challenge – we’re creating a new era of mental health.”The ice bucket challenge: why are people pouring cold water on celebrities?Read moreOthers have questioned whether the fundraising approach should be used to raise awareness for issues other than MND. But Evans said: “The MND Association hasn’t been using it as a fundraising tool over the last few years, so if others doing important work want to take it forward, then we wish them all the very best.”Evans said his charity had discussed resurrecting the challenge last year but decided against it. “We decided to look forward and develop new fundraising opportunities rather than going back to something that was a massive success all those years ago,” he said.“With the fantastic campaigning and sad deaths of [rugby players] Doddie Weir and Rob Burrow, the ongoing work of Kevin Sinfield, and the MND plotline in Coronation Street last year, the public’s awareness of the disease has been transformed, which is showing in the amazing sums that we’re fundraising and devoting to finding a cure for the disease.”The ALS Association also praised Mind’s efforts, saying it was “thrilled” that the Ice Bucket Challenge was making a comeback and becoming a “new form of activism”.“We applaud efforts to raise awareness for causes like mental health – an issue that also affects the ALS community in profound ways,” said a spokesperson.Explore more on these topicsMental healthMotor neurone diseaseSocial mediaPeyton ManningfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The property has five acres of gardens which were designed by Wordsworth.He had rented the house, but in the late 1960s it was bought by his descendants, and has since been open to the public for most of the year. However, after the Covid pandemic, visitor numbers dropped sharply and the house was put on the market for offers over £2.5m.Wordsworth’s great great great great granddaughter, Charlotte Wontner, is now leading a campaign to encourage financial backers to step in and help preserve the house and gardens so that they can be kept open for the public.“It’s too often we are losing our incredible links with the past and this is one major link to the past that we cannot lose”, said Succession actor Cox.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

This treasure belongs to the nation – as much as it does William Wordsworth.”Wontner, whose grandmother bought Rydal Mount in 1969, described it as a “living museum”. The gardens “are where Wordsworth wrote many of his poems and when people get there, there is this wonderful sense of being closer to the poetry.”She said that Wordsworth’s poetry is becoming increasingly important because of his appreciation for nature and the environment.Her cousin, Christopher, who is selling the house, is supportive of the campaign, she said. “We all have the same goal which is to find a way of keeping the house open to people. There may be other relatives who feel the same way and I hope they will get in touch.”The house has “always been referred to, I think, as a place of solace, and that is an important thing nowadays. A place to just have a break from the everyday craziness.”Explore more on these topicsBooksCumbriaWilliam WordsworthnewsShareReuse this content"

The crown’s case is that Packer did not believe she was less than 10 weeks pregnant when she took the drugs.The remote prescribing legislation was introduced during the Covid crisis, before being made permanent. Terminations are usually available up to 23 weeks and six days of pregnancy, with no time limits in place in certain circumstances, such as a severe foetal anomaly or if the mother’s life is at risk.Giving evidence via video link, the witness, who cannot be named, said that Packer, whom she said she had been friends with for years, had come to stay with her and her husband during lockdown.The jury heard that while staying with the couple – at their home in the UK and when the three travelled abroad together – the friend would regularly see Packer without clothes.They had spent time in a swimming pool and in hot tubs, the court heard, and were comfortable enough together that Packer would not wear many clothes in the house.The friend said she would see her “cooking with very little on, or walking round the house with very little on”.“You were able to see her with no clothes on right up until the end of October 2020,” Fiona Horlick KC, defending Packer, said, addressing the friend.“There was nothing that ever indicated to you that she was pregnant?” Horlick asked.“Nothing,” the friend said, “absolutely nothing.” She said she had noticed “no change in dress size. No, nothing.”The friend also said that Packer had not changed her drinking habits at any point, and described herself, her husband and Packer drinking “a lot” of wine and cocktails together. In October, she said, there was “no change from any other month, really”.She also told the court that “some time in October” Packer had also “asked to borrow tampons”, later confirming to the court that she had supplied her with these, and said this was around the time they were isolating at home having returned from a trip abroad early that month.“We had discussions about period pains, had discussions about whether hers were worse than mine, because I was going through menopause,” the friend said. “We had a discussion about that in October, she asked whether I had any tampons.”Photographs of the defendant, some of which showed her in a state of undress, were also shown to the jury and the witness by the defence.“I would like to make it crystal clear that it was the defence who chose to show those photographs to the witness,” the judge, Martin Edmunds KC, said. “They did so as part of the defence case, and clearly with the consent of the defendant.”Also giving evidence, DC Lucy Gallimore told the court that after Packer phoned MSI on 2 November to seek an appointment for a termination, web searches on her phone included “is at home abortion treatment effective up to 12 weeks” and “abortion limit UK”.She is alleged to have taken the pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, on 6 November.The trial, which is scheduled to last between five and six weeks, continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

That leaves a “shocking blind spot” in the service’s data collection, the firm said.Neil Clayton, a medical negligence partner, said the NHS’s failure to ensure such information was kept was “deeply concerning”. It could hamper its efforts to spot “worrying patterns of care failures” and improve the experience of maternity services for BAME families, he said.“Given thewell-documented racial disparities in maternity carethis lack of tracking is simply unacceptable. Patients and their families deserve transparency, and without this information it is impossible to push for meaningful improvements in care.”Clayton added: “The absence of ethnicity data is a glaring omission that undermines efforts to address inequality and ensure accountability in the healthcare system.”Black women in the UK are almost four timesmore likely to die during pregnancy or while giving birththan their white counterparts. Black babies are twice as likely to die before reaching 24 weeks of gestation.Paul Whiteing, the chief executive of the patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said: “There is evidence that those from ethnic minority backgrounds are more likely to experience poor healthcare. This can result in medical negligence. So it is shocking that the NHS collects no ethnicity and nationality data to better understand the drivers of this link.”Whiteing added that the NHS did not record such details about the identity of people who made complaints about the care they have received either and should start doing so.Prof Habib Naqvi, the chief executive of the NHSRace and Health Observatory, said if decisions about healthcare were based on incomplete evidence “health interventions will continue to leave our most marginalised communities under-supported and poorly cared for”.Naqvi said: “It will mean that the NHS continues to fly blind in its attempts to meet legal and moral obligations to tackle health inequalities.”The government wants to see better data collection as part of efforts to address the “stark inequalities for women and babies”, the Department ofHealthand Social Care said.An NHS spokesperson said: “No woman should experience poor care because of her ethnicity or background and better data is essential to understanding where and how we need to intervene. We are taking immediate action to ensure authorities are improving how we collect data so we can identify and reduce inequalities.”Explore more on these topicsNHSRacePregnancyHealthHealth policyPublic services policyWomennewsShareReuse this content"

She was frightened by his unpredictable behaviour and moved to a flat, but he followed the removals van and admitted fitting a tracker to a car. He also repeatedly sent messages to her in which he would threaten to kill himself.Butler, a former doorman, was arrested several times for stalking and harassment but he broke bail conditions ordering him to leave her alone and was still on bail when he stabbed her, the court heard.Chick signed her final statement to police the day before her death and the prosecutor, Joanna Martin KC, said: “She believed he would murder her.”Butler had previous convictions for violence and sexual offences against girls and women from 1986-88 when he was a teenager.Martin told the court that by January this year Butler had “formulated a plan” as he wore a camouflage jacket, cap and rucksack and bought three kitchen knives from a supermarket.The attack was caught in harrowing CCTV and dashcam footage shown to the court during a 22-minute compilation of events. Chick shouted “get off me” but suffered 23 stab wounds in a short space of time and probably died at the scene, Martin said.Martin said Butler suspected Chick had moved on with a new relationship with a man called Paul Maxwell, who came across the fatal attack. Butler chased Maxwell off before fleeing himself and dumping the knife and then his cap and jacket in a bin.Chick worked as a lecturer in adult nursing at the University of Plymouth. A statement from the university earlier in the year described her as a nurse, lecturer and personal tutor, and said she was the associate head of school for international in the university’s school of nursing and midwifery. She had been involved in developing nursing programmes in Europe, Africa and Asia.After Chick’s death, Devon and Cornwall police made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to previous contact with the victim. “Our investigation into Claire Chick’s contact with Devon and Cornwall police prior to her murder in January is ongoing,” an IOPC spokesperson said.“Our thoughts and sympathies remain with Ms Chick’s family and we are keeping them updated on the progress of our investigation.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeViolence against women and girlsPlymouthnewsShareReuse this content"

He was wearing tan jail garb with a white long-sleeved undershirt. He spoke with his lawyers, who sat alongside him, and at one point appeared to smile; he could be seen flipping through papers on the table.Judge Margaret M Garnett asked Mangione to stand, and Mangione confirmed to the justice that he had seen a copy of this indictment and had had enough time to discuss it with his lawyers.Garnett asked Mangione his plea. Mangione said: “Not guilty.”Mangione could face the death penalty in a case that shocked America for the killing of a top business executive on New York’s streets but also triggered an outpouring of anger against the country’s for-profit healthcare industry.As with previous proceedings, throngs of supporters of Mangione queued up outside to secure a much-coveted seat in court. Many sported medical masks or sunglasses, or both, and were reticent about speaking to media but did attack the healthcare system.The alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer faces the death penalty. Will a jury impose that punishment?Read more“I am a chronically ill person. I live in chronic pain,” one woman said in explaining why she was at court. She said that she had never been in “that much medical debt” compared to others, but “when I say not that much I mean like $30,000.”Even if it were proved that Mangione killed Thompson, she said, she believed his guilt embodies an ethical grey area. The healthcare industry kills thousands and Thompson was one man, she said. “One life [versus] like a thousand lives, that moral dilemma,” she said.When asked about the announcement prosecutors would seek the death penalty, she said: “It’s state-sanctioned murder.“He’s a political prisoner – school shooters don’t get that.”As those waiting in line chatted among themselves, an LCD-screen truck, displaying support of Mangione, repeatedly drove by the courthouse. One image featured a photo of Mangione smiling that read: “END THE DEATH PENALTY NOW.” The intelligence whistleblower Chelsea Manning was also among those in line.Mangione’s arraignment comes months after his arrest for allegedly gunning down Thompson outside a New York hotel on 4 December. He was apprehended on 9 December at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a restaurant worker purportedlyrecognized himfrom law enforcement advisories and tipped off police.In federal court, Mangione faces stalking, murder through use of a firearm, and firearms offense charges. Mangione is also charged with a host of murder and firearms counts in New York state court.Pennsylvania state prosecutors are also pursuing a case against him related to alleged weapons possession and false identification. He has also maintained his innocence in the state cases.While Mangione was already staring down the prospect of life imprisonment following his arrest,Donald Trump’s attorney general,Pam Bondi, raised the stakes several weeks ago by announcing that she was directing prosecutorsto seekthedeath penalty.Bondi called Thompson’s killing “a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”. Shestatedthat her decision was in keeping with “President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again”.‘Hannibal Lecter’ treatment of Luigi Mangione ‘backfired’, says fundraising organizerRead moreIn court, Garnett cautioned prosecutors against making inflammatory statements. She urged them to abide by local court rules that bar attorneys from making “public commentary that could impede Mr Mangione’s right to a fair trial” and to pick a fair jury.“I’m specifically directing the government to convey my directive to Mr Clayton,” Garnett said, referring to acting Manhattan federal prosecutor Jay Clayton. The judge also directed that prosecutors “request that he convey the same to Attorney General Bondi” and her associates.The last time federal prosecutors in Manhattan pursued the death penalty was in the case ofSayfullo Saipov, an Islamist extremist who murdered eight people in a truck attack.During the penalty phase of Saipov’s trial, jurors could not unanimously decide on whether to impose a death sentence, resulting in him being automatically sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole.Gregory Germain, a professor of law at Syracuse University’s College of Law, previously told the Guardian that nearly all recent federal death penalty cases took place during Trump’s first term.Germain said hebelievedthat Trump’s justice department would not agree to an deal in which Mangione pleaded guilty in exchange for a life sentence.“He has political reasons, wanting to seem ‘tough on crime’ by supporting the death penalty,” Germain said.Karen Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s lead defense attorney, raised several constitutional points during the proceeding. She said there was a “handshake deal” forged between Manhattan prosecutors and Biden’s justice department, under which his state case would be tried first.But now that federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, Friedman Agnifilo said they would fight this plan.“It’s partly scheduling, your honor, but it’s also constitutional issues [that] are going to be impacted if we are forced to try that case first,” she said.Friedman Agnifilo also alleged in court that authorities had been listening in on Mangione’s privileged communications.“We were just informed by the state court prosecutors that they were eavesdropping on all of Mr Mangione’s calls,” she said. “They were listening to his attorney calls and all of his other calls going on. They said it was inadvertent that they were listening to a call between Mr Mangione and me.”Friedman Agnifilo asked the judge to put a directive in place to prevent this from happening again. Garnett asked the prosecutor Dominic Gentile about the alleged recording.Gentile said this was “the very first we’ve heard of this situation” and that such would not be “normal practice”.Garnett told Gentile that she wanted prosecutors to file a letter within seven days outlining what they knew about the recording.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkBrian Thompson shootingLaw (US)US crimeUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

He was ultimately convicted of defrauding donors.Santos, 36, was sentenced on Friday morning in Long Island, the large suburban area to the east ofNew YorkCity.He sobbed in court saying he was “humbled” and “chastised” and realized he had betrayed his constituents’ trust. He pleaded guilty last summer to federal wire fraud and aggravated identity theft and had appealed for mercy.“I offer my deepest apologies,” he said on Friday, adding: “I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.”US district court judge Joanna Seybert appeared unconvinced by his display of contrition.“Where is your remorse? Where do I see it?” she asked as she sentenced him to 87 months behind bars. She said the former politician appeared to feel that “it’s always someone else’s fault”.2:18George Santos expelled from Congress: a recap of some of his lies – video reportHe served in Congress barely a year before his House of Representatives colleagues ousted him in 2023. Having flipped his seat to the GOP it then reverted to the Democrats withTom Suozzi winningthe vacant spot in a special election in February last year.He admitted to deceiving donors and stealing the identities of nearly a dozen people, including his family members, to fund his winning campaign. He also made upstrings of fantastical storiesabout his life, identity and experiences.During his court case he frequently held press gatherings and mocked the media and his detractors, saying he was being smeared.Santos was shown to havespent donor moneyon vacations, luxury goods, Botox treatment and the website OnlyFans.Shortly before being elected to the US House of Representatives in New York’s third congressional district, Santos was first accused of deceiving voters by the North Shore Leader, a local newspaper in Long Island, which accused Santos of fabricating much of his résumé.‘Profoundly sorry’ George Santos writes to judge ahead of fraud sentencingRead moreSantos’s sentencing was not without controversy. Before his Friday court appearance, he referred to himself as a “scapegoat” on social media, in reference to prosecutors accusing him of organizing the fraudulent conspiracy.Santos also alleged that the justice department was a “cabal of pedophiles”, in posts made to X. Prosecutors highlighted Santos’s comments in a filing after Santos’s defense team requested a two-year prison sentence.The former representative later defended his remarks,saying he was “profoundly sorry”for his crimes but that a seven-year prison sentence was too harsh.“Every sunrise since that plea has carried the same realization: I did this, me. I am responsible,” Santos wrote. “But saying I’m sorry doesn’t require me to sit quietly while these prosecutors try to drop an anvil on my head.”Santospleaded guiltyto wire fraud and aggravated identity theft in August.Prosecutors, at the time, highlighted Santos’s plea as the first time that he had “told the truth about his criminal schemes”.George Santos’s weirdest lies revisited as he pleads guilty to fraudRead more“For what may seem like the first time since he started his campaign for Congress, Mr Santos told the truth about his criminal schemes. He admitted to lying, stealing and conning people,” said Breon Peace, the US attorney for the eastern district of New York, in astatement.“By pleading guilty, Mr Santos has acknowledged that he repeatedly defrauded federal and state government institutions as well as his own family, supporters and constituents. His flagrant and disgraceful conduct has been exposed and will be punished. Mr Santos’s conviction demonstrates this office’s enduring commitment to rooting out corruption and grift by public officials.”At the time, Santos faced 22 years in prison.As part of the plea agreement, Santos was forced to pay a restitution of $373,749.97 and forfeiture of $205,002.97.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsGeorge SantosRepublicansNew YorkLaw (US)newsShareReuse this content"

Fatal police shootings are relatively rare in Germany and prosecutors were quoted in local media as saying the suspension and investigation were “routine”.Police have not identified the victim due to data protection laws but media and pressure groups have identified him as Lorenz A.Police said in a statement that the man, a German citizen, aimed pepper spray at security staff outside the club after they refused him entry, hurting four people, and that he threatened others with a knife while running away.When a patrol car tracked him down, police said he again used the pepper spray and approached the 27-year-old officer in a threatening manner. The police officer then opened fire.A coroner’s report found that at least three bullets hit the man from behind: in the back of his head, torso and hip, local prosecutors said. A fourth shot is believed to have grazed his upper thigh. He later died in hospital.The state interior minister, Daniela Behrens, said the autopsy results raised “serious questions and grave suspicions” that must be “unsparingly addressed and resolved”.Police representatives warned against any rush to judgment. “There are racism accusations because the deceased was a person of colour,” Kevin Komolka, the state chair of the GdP police union, told the public broadcaster NDR. “There’s a mood developing painting police as trigger-happy hooligans.”Prosecutors have begun evaluating security camera footage and audio recordings from the scene and said there was no indication that Lorenz A had threatened police with the knife he had with him. The officers’ body cameras were reportedly turned off.Rights groups, which have organised a rally in Oldenburg on Friday, said the shooting raised serious concerns.The German chapter of Amnesty International said the killing “impacts an entire community and all those people in Germany affected by racism”. It said any investigation into the incident led by police would be biased. “We finally need independent investigation mechanisms that are not controlled by police or interior affairs authorities,” it said, citing “structural racism”.The Black People in Germany Initiative (ISD) quoted friends and the family of Lorenz, calling him a keen basketball player and a “fun-loving person who was full of energy”.“Now he’s dead, killed by an institution that is supposed to protect us,” it said in a statement, joining the call for an independent investigation as well as a national complaints office for allegations of police racism.The ‪Amadeu Antonio Foundation, which campaigns against extremism and racism in German society, also denounced what it said was not an isolated incident and questioned the police account that the officer had grounds to fear for his life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Attorneys in those cases had asked the court to issue a nationwide injunction covering all students whose official records granting them legal status were terminated since 1 March, and were at risk of deportation.On Friday, assistant US attorney Elizabeth D Kurlan said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) was developing a new policy to govern how records are terminated on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (Sevis), a federal database used to track international students’ immigration status. A similar announcement was made in a court in Washington.Deported over a speeding ticket? Dozens of US students’ visas abruptly revokedRead moreIn recent weeks, numerous students received notifications that their records were terminated with little explanation, jeopardizing their legal right to remain in the US and sparking outrage and confusion. Some said they had their status revoked for infractionsas minor as a speeding ticket.“DSOs [designated school officials] certified to assist international students) around the country are freaking out because out of nowhere they’re starting to see Ice manipulating the Sevis system to terminate students’ records around the country,” plaintiffs’ attorney Brad Banias said in an earlier interview.According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), once a Sevis record is deleted from the database, which is often called being “terminated”, a student immediately falls out of status and risks deportation or future visa denials unless they quickly depart the US or regain lawful status.Until the new Ice policy is finalized, Sevis records for the plaintiffs and other students affected by similar terminations will remain active or be reactivated. On Thursday afternoon, students across the country began receiving official notices from their schools stating that their Sevis records had been unexpectedly reactivated.The news has brought some relief but not a full resolution, with some students saying the change has already caused irreparable harm.“They call it a ‘restoration’, but for those of us who lived through it, who’s accountable for what we lost?” said one California student, who asked to remain anonymous. She was in the US on an F-1 work authorization when her Sevis record was terminated in April, she suspects due to being fingerprinted when she received a driving ticket six years ago. Her employer fired her the next day after learning she could no longer legally work.The judge ordered the government to submit an explanation of the policy and its legal impact by the end of Friday. All plaintiffs in the hearing were granted 14-day temporary restraining orders (TROs) shielding them from deportation or any adverse legal consequences.Marc L Van Der Hout, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, said he believes Ice’s new policy is a direct response to a recent order from the US district judge Jeffrey S White, who presided over Friday’s hearing in Oakland and had already granted TROs in some of the eight lawsuits.“They’re trying to argue the court doesn’t need to act now – but they’re only doing this because of Judge White’s order, 1,000%.”According to data collected by National Association of Foreign Student Advisors (Nafsa), more than 1,400 students have reported Sevis terminations so far this year, with about 40% of them from India and China.Nationwide, more than 70 lawsuits have been filed in 21 states challenging Sevis terminations. In at least 45 cases, judges have granted temporary restraining orders, citing possible violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and due process protections.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionKurlan added that Ice retains the authority to terminate Sevis records for other reasons, such as a student failing to maintain lawful status or engaging in what it considers to be removable conduct.Pam Johann, a lawyer for the US government, argued against the request for national relief in the Oakland courthouse on Friday, stating that the agency’s ongoing actions to restore Sevis records make such an order unnecessary. Government lawyers responded that Ice was already addressing the issue in real time and that a nationwide injunction would be an “extraordinary remedy”.Judge White pushed back. “Seems like with this administration, it’s a new world order every single day,” he said. “I think the administration writ large has a tendency to do everything in this particular area on an ad hoc basis, and we have to now consider it.”The plaintiffs’ attorney John Nicholas Sinodis said unresolved gaps in Sevis timelines could still put students at risk of deportation or future visa denials. Lasting harm had already been done, especially for those who filed for reinstatement or left the US believing their status had ended.Following the news, plaintiff expressed a mix of relief and lingering anxiety. “I’m worried my record might still have a stain, and it could cause problems later with jobs, visas, or getting through immigration,” said one, who asked to stay anonymous due to concerns about retaliation.According to court records, their status was terminated based on an arrest record on reported domestic violence two years ago that did not result in any charges.Despite the uncertainty, they remain confident about the eventual outcome. “I believe we will win, because I know very clearly that I don’t deserve this.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationWest CoastCaliforniaLaw (US)StudentsHigher educationUS universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Teamsters union lobbied heavily for the bill.California currently prohibits any type of autonomous vehicle that weighs more than 10,000lbs on public roads.The proposed regulations for heavy-duty trucks aim toenhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers, such as reporting instances when cars stop in the middle of an active road for any reason and need to be retrieved. They will give the state’s DMV more authority to apply “incremental enforcement measures” against companies instead of fully suspending their testing permits.The DMVsuspendedthe permit of driverless car company Cruise in 2023 after one of the company’s self-driving carsstruck a pedestrian in San Francisco.

Archaeologists believe the vessel may have sunk during a storm in the 15th or 16th centuries.Photograph: from Arqueòlegs.catThe structure was held together by a mix of wooden and iron nails. The construction is typical of the medieval boats that were found in the Mediterranean and throughoutEuropefrom the middle of the 15th century.“We’d thought some archaeological boat remains might turn up on this site, which is near the port and the artificial stone quay that protected the port, and which was a working zone in the 15th and 16th centuries,” said the lead archaeologist, Santi Palacios. “Two years later, we’ve been lucky enough to find a boat.”The surviving wood of the boat – which has been named the Ciutadella I after the nearby Ciutadella park – is very fragile and has been kept damp and covered with the sand in which it lay for centuries to help prevent further deterioration.“The wood has to be kept constantly damp so as to keep it in a good state,” said Delia Eguiluz, a restorer. “When we move it, we’ll have to dismantle it piece-by-piece so we can continue our research.”The team is mapping the site, labelling all the pieces and taking samples from the boat.

In return, he offered political support for the appointment of executives at BR Distribuidora when it was still state-owned.Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest. He was arrested on Friday in the northeastern state of Alagoas.Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the supreme court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals.The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash,a sweeping corruption investigationthat has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America – including the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years.Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil.Supreme court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president’s arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president’s lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals.The justice also said that the court had previously ruled in similar cases that, once appeals have no merit, the sentence can be served right away.Collor’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no firing on the civilian population. Life is normal. Schools are open,” said Gilani, a senior government official in Jhelum valley district.India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms that it said had been initiated by Pakistan, adding it had been “effectively responded to”.Three Indian army officials told Reuters that Pakistani soldiers used small-arms to fire at an Indian position. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said Indian soldiers retaliated and no casualties were reported.There was no immediate comment from Pakistan, and the incident could not be independently verified. In the past, each side has accused the other of starting border skirmishes in Kashmir, which both claim in its entirety.India’s army chief, Gen Upendra Dwivedi, is to lead a high-level security review in Srinagar in Indian-held Kashmir on Friday, days after militants killed 26 civilians in the disputed region in one of theworst such attacks in years.The brazen assault, carried out in a mountain meadow near Pahalgam, has derailed prime minister Narendra Modi’s claims of restored calm in the restive Himalayan territory and sent tensions soaring between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan.Map of regionThe Indian army has launched sweeping “search-and-destroy” operations, deployed surveillance drones, and ramped up troop numbers across the Kashmir valley. The manhunt is searching for three suspects – one Indian national and two Pakistanis.Early on Friday, authorities in Indian Kashmir demolished the houses of two suspected militants, one of whom is an accused in Tuesday’s attack, according to an official.As tensions rise between the two countries, the UN has urged India and Pakistan to show restraint. The countries have imposedtit-for-tat diplomatic measuresover a deadly shooting in Kashmir.Relations haveplunged to their lowest level in years, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, after gunmen carried out the worst attack on civilians in contested Muslim-majority Kashmir in a quarter of a century.“We very much appeal to both the governments … to exercise maximum restraint, and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further,” the UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, told reporters in New York on Thursday.“Any issues between Pakistan and India, we believe, can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement.”1:10Tensions escalate between India and Pakistan after Kashmir attack – videoDwivedi’s visit to the regional capital underscores a sharp increase in military and diplomatic activity. India began large-scale air and naval drills on Thursday, which analysts say could pave the way for military action.The Indian air force’s Gagan Shakti exercises, showcasing its Rafale jets and elite strike squadrons, have assumed added urgency, while the navy has intensified manoeuvres and test-fired a surface-to-air missile.“There are many imponderables Modi must deal with, including the significant capabilities of the Pakistan army,” the veteran analystC Raja Mohan wrotein the Indian Express. “But given the horrific nature of the attack and the outrage that has convulsed the nation – the victims came from 15 states across India – the PM may have no option but to explore some major risks.”On the diplomatic front, India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, briefed envoys from 25 countries, including key G20 partners, Gulf states and, notably, China. Beijing’s inclusion, despite strained ties, was seen as an attempt to build broader global consensus.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Indian Secular Front, along with others, stage a protest over the killing of more than 25 tourists at Pahalgam.Photograph: Rupak De Chowdhuri/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockIndia presented what it called “clear evidence of cross-border complicity”. An obscure group calling itself the Resistance Front has claimed responsibility for the attack. Indian officials say it is a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba or a similar outfit. Islamabad denied involvement, accusing India of failing to provide proof.On Thursday, Modi promised to capture the gunmen responsible forkilling 26 civilians, after Indian police identified two of the three fugitive assailants as Pakistani.“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” the prime minister said, in his first speech since Tuesday’s attack in the Himalayan region. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.”Denying any involvement, Islamabad called attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam attack “frivolous” and vowed to respond to any Indian action.“Any threat to Pakistan’s sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains,” a Pakistani statement said, after the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, held a rare national security committee meeting with top military chiefs.Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since its independence in 1947, with both claiming the territory in full but governing separate portions of it.Rebel groups have waged an insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir since 1989, demanding independence or a merger with Pakistan.1:17Manhunt launched after 26 tourists killed by suspected militants in Kashmir – videoA day after the attack, New Delhi suspended a water-sharing treaty, announced theclosure of the main land border crossingwith Pakistan, downgraded diplomatic ties, and withdrew visas for Pakistanis.In response, Islamabad ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers on Thursday, cancelling visas for Indian nationals – with the exception of Sikh pilgrims – and closing the main border crossing from its side.Pakistan also warned any attempt by India to stop the supply of water from the Indus River would be an “act of war”.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanKashmirSouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

The last time the index fell below 55 was in the summer of 2022, when inflation rose to 9%.Consumer expectation of inflation also soared from 5% in March to 6.5% in April, the highest it has been since 1981.It is a sign that, despite his insistence thattariffswill “make a lot of money” and have not yet raised prices, Trump still has not convinced many Americans that his tariffs will actually work.Xi announces plan for Chinese economy to counter impact of US trade warRead moreTrump’s trade policies have scared investors, causingsell-offsin stock andbond markets. The presidentsoftenedhis tone earlier this week on his trade war with China after a volatile few weeks. Markets rallied after Trump said that his Chinese tariffs “will come down substantially”, though he also warned that “it won’t be zero.”But Wall Street tends to be more reactive than consumers, who have shown four straight months of declining sentiment on the economy. Even after Trump paused the highest of his reciprocal tariffs, causing stock markets to rise, consumer inflation expectations still remained much higher compared with March.Higher inflation expectations have also been paired with consumers anticipating slower income growth for the year ahead, meaning that more of them will be hesitant to spend in the months ahead – which all could ultimately mean a slowdown in the economy.“Without reliably strong incomes, spending is unlikely to remain strong amid the numerous warning signs perceived by consumers,” Hsu said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsTrump administrationGlobal economyUS politicsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

They stand for unity over divisionKaty HesselFri 25 Apr 2025 13.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 13.25 EDTShareIn 2022, two wooden sculptures stood on the riverbanks of Brooklyn. Configured as bodies with multiple heads, the monumental works – part of a larger group titled Agali Awamu, which translates as “Togetherness” – towered over those who interacted with them. They appeared as an antidote to the silver, white or green reflective buildings that stood behind them: hand-carved and human-like, with mouths that appeared to be singing or whistling, and eyes barely open, perhaps to signify a joyous introspection. While one was made up of two bodies conjoined at the hip, the other had billowing hair and carried faces on its back and belly, which seemed to be singing in harmony. The sculptures looked peaceful, and protective of each other and of those who walked past them.From far away these figures, created by the Ugandan-born, New York-based artist Leilah Babirye, looked regal. They stood tall, adorned with glistening belts and jewellery. But up close, you noticed that their ornaments were made up of rusty chains, old wire, used bolts and bicycle parts – objects once discarded, deemed as meaningless, but whose beauty had been noticed by the artist. She reused them for a celebratory monument of power and protection.View image in fullscreenValuing what’s thrown away … Leilah Babirye in 2022.Photograph: David Benthal/BFA.com/ShutterstockBabirye is known for recycling discarded items for her sculptures. Consider it a metaphor for how she and her LGBTQ+ community have been treated in her native Uganda, where being queer is still punishable by death. After the country’s anti-homosexuality bill was passed in 2013, and the artist was publicly outed in the homophobic Ugandan press, Babirye fled to the US to seek asylum, having initially been awarded a residency on Fire Island, New York.Using art to upend negative stereotypes and challenge dismissive remarks, Babirye’s huge sculptures stand up to the silencing of her communities, transforming rubbish into a site of possibility: recycling pens and bottle-caps to make a crown; evoking long hair with an old bike chain.“When you look at trash, it’s something that everybody throws out,” she told me. “It’s something that doesn’t hold any value any more to a person who considers it trash at that particular time […] So the only way to bring the value of us – the ‘trash’ – is by showing how important we are, how vocal we can be, how professional we can be, and how talented we are.”View image in fullscreenPart of the exhibition Leilah Babirye: We Have a History in San Francisco in 2024.Photograph: Gary Sexton/courtesy of the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoI thought of Babirye’s sculptures – that can range from single heads and talismans to giant ceramic clan-like communities – in the wake of the UK supreme court’s ruling that trans women are not recognised as women, nor trans men as men, under the 2010 Equality Act. The judgment has not only caused distraction from other urgent court rulings and news, but will inflate culture wars and boost violence towards an already extremely vulnerable group who make up less than 1% of the population.Trans communities have existed, and always will. It’s more important than ever to champion, promote and celebrate themThe ruling will surely have a detrimental health and emotional impact on trans and non-binary people, and could force public organisations to change their policies on inclusion and single-sex spaces in ways that puts trans people at risk. But, as the artist Victoria Cantons reminds me, the decision is also “a gateway for more control on women” and will “push women’s and men’s roles into more binary structures, which will be detrimental for women’s rights in general”. She also pointed out that not a single trans group was even heard on the panel before the decision was made.Shot through the heart: when it comes to expressing love, only art can do it justiceRead moreWhile our prime minister and government have become increasingly hostile to trans rights since being elected, the fact is that trans communities have existed, and always will. It’s more important than ever to champion, promote and celebrate them – echoing the spirit oflast weekend’s protests, which were peacefuland full of love.Art can be a powerful way to promote the voices of those who aren’t being heard in society, but also as a tool for helping us see the beauty, possibility and basic humanity in each other.I am reminded of something that the artist Martha Rosler – who, like Babirye, works in collage, assembling images and objects that create new possibilities – once told me: “This habit of division, of breaking things apart, holds us back from being whole people, and from building a whole society. On this spinning blue marble we all share, there is no ‘here’ or ‘there’. As a species, our destinies are increasingly intertwined: we are one. Cooperation isn’t just wise; it’s essential. And recognising that isn’t just important; it’s crucial.”How can anyone look at Babirye’s Togetherness and not want unity rather than division?Explore more on these topicsArt and designThe great women's art bulletinLGBTQ+ rightsTransgenderWomenSculptureArtUK supreme courtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are shades of Uncle Vanya,a play McPherson has adapted, with a plot involving a family reuniting in the countryside to feud over the ownership of land and inheritance. There are elements of the American family dysfunction drama too, though this is distinctly Irish in its cadence, rhythm and setting. Individually, each influence is valid and every idea is a good one but together the play seems to swing on its hinges, like this family’s clapped out farm-door.We are in the rural depths of County Sligo in 1981, inside a household run by two siblings: the stoic Stephen (Brian Gleeson), who is existing rather than living, and the eccentric and autistic Billie (Rosie Sheehy). They are marooned on the down-at-heel farm, just about making ends meet until their wealthier brother, Dermot (Chris O’Dowd) drops by. His presence coincides with the arrival of an old blind uncle and former clergyman (Seán McGinley) who has been ejected from church quarters and now shuffles into the family home with his housekeeper, Elizabeth (Derbhle Crotty), with a dispute over the farm’s ownership – though this plot point does not emerge until late on.View image in fullscreenA standout force … Rosie Sheehy in The Brightening Air.Photograph: Manuel HarlanComfy domesticity offsets abrasive sibling undercurrents as they gather around a dining table to eat, reminiscence and poke each other. McPherson, who also directs, throws in other tensions: Dermot comes with his inappropriately young squeeze, Freya (Aisling Kearns) while his estranged wife, Lydia (Hannah Morrish), still in love with her husband, puts her faith in “magic water” that might return him to her.The pace is too easy in the first half, as the flotsam and jetsam of family life float by. There is a good Chekhovian mix of melancholy and humour in the cross-conversational currents between family members, but it all needs more momentum and emotional drive. The second half brings more intensity but also a plot that feels stretched to aburdism: there is a miracle in the vein of the biblical Bartimaeus (the blind beggar from Jericho) alongside the falling out and making up over inheritance.The mystical element sits well within the plotline of the magic water but becomes pronounced and protruding when characters talk about God and nothingness. You get the sense of a playwright preoccupied by big questions about the afterlife (with repeated mentions of reincarnation and the Ganges) but this sometimes sounds non sequitur in the mouths of his characters.There are none of the explosions of an American dysfunction drama here and angry face-offs between siblings steer close to the humorous and absurd.Sibling ribbing sometimes combusts into something more; there is wrestling between brothers, the lone sister is one of the “lads”, and home truths are occasionally spoken, or shouted, but you wish these scenes would dig into a few more nerves.‘To hell with RP’ … how surprise Olivier nominee Rosie Sheehy is following in Richard Burton’s footstepsRead moreStill, there are heaps of charm and a few searing moments. McPherson’s last work at the Old Vic was the musicalGirl from the North Country, and there is music here too, though it is not a musical. Lovely dramatic interludes feature piano music, songs carrying Celtic lilts but also, puzzlingly, a Bollywood number.An incredibly strong cast is gathered: O’Dowd is a delight as the family’s self-regarding eldest brother and Sheehy, as always, is a standout force. She plays a largely comic character but infuses Billie with great emotion.The idea of love and its yearning is shown with delicacy. Every character seems unrequited, from the farmhand (Eimhin Fitzgerald Doherty) who is sweet on Billie, to the sexual undercurrents that swirl around Stephen and Lydia. Rae Smith’s set is beautiful, full of diaphanous, overlying images of trees, water, misty mountains, sky, conjuring a vivid sense of place but also carrying a certain otherworldly magic. Sometimes this production lifts off, as if it is about to enter into the sublime, but is strangely dragged down by too many elements jostling to take flight.At theOld Vic, London, until 14 June.Explore more on these topicsConor McPhersonTheatreOld Vic TheatreChris O'DowdreviewsShareReuse this content"

On any night, across its upstairs studio theatre, its main house and basement cabaret bar, you’ll find plays from new writers, experimentations in clowning, drag performance, standup comedy, or a hybrid of them all.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In those rooms, I’ve watched American clown Natalie Palamides giving such a spirited performance that she vomited on stage, dancer and comedian Adrienne Truscott challenging rape jokes, and performance artist Kim Noble pushing audiences beyond comfort. I’ve sung along to ballads with sketch group Daphne, and folk songs with Sh!tTheatre.Soho does all this by running a “festival programme”, with multiple shows per room, per night. “It allows us to take risks,” says executive director and CEO Mark Godfrey. “You can say now, 25 years on, we had the first play from Tanika Gupta, from Moira Buffini, early work from Chris Chibnall.”And perhaps most famously of all,Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who first performed her one-woman show – and later hit TV series – Fleabag at the venue. “Soho theatre has a genuinely experimental, risk-taking attitude,” Waller-Bridge says. “It’s one of the only theatres that consistently puts on provocative work from lesser-known writers and performers and encourages them to be original. I’ve seen some of the best work of my life in those spaces.”Waller-Bridge began her artistic relationship with Soho in 2009, in finance-industry satireRoaring Trade: “I remember throttling Andrew Scott with a tie as the lights went up every night, which was the beginning of one of the most happy collaborations of my life.” With colleagues in her DryWrite theatre company, Francesca Moody and Vicky Jones, she became an associate artist at the theatre, commissioning Adolescence writer Jack Thorne’s play Mydidae in 2012.Fleabag first appeared in Soho’s upstairs room. Being offered space to preview “was no small thing”, Waller-Bridge says. It returned, post-Edinburgh, and Soho supported its West End transfer. “It’s Fleabag’s home. The Soho theatre audience is so up for it … unshockable, game for anything, fun-loving and curious.”Now that game-for-anything is going to get a lot larger. As the theatre celebrates its 25th anniversary, it’s also starting a new chapter – the opening of 1,000-seaterSoho TheatreWalthamstow, in north-east London, where it will entertain its biggest audiences yet.We started to feel like the natural home for people’s one-hour shows in the early 2000s, and it’s snowballed from thenSteve Lock, head of comedyIt’s been a long journey. Soho theatre on the West End’s Dean Street opened in 2000, but the company was founded as the Soho Theatre Company in the late 60s by theatre directors Verity Bargate (namesake of Soho’s new writing award) and Fred Proud. It became Soho Poly when it moved into a university basement in 1972. Deliberately free from “the trappings of bourgeois theatre architecture”, it was a pioneer of lunchtime theatre, allowing performances to “reach a different sort of audience”,write Matthew Morrison and Guy Osbornefrom the University of Westminster. That basement showcased future stars such as Bob Hoskins, Harriet Walter, Hanif Kureishi and Caryl Churchill. “It was about new plays and new writing, that fringe explosion of the 70s,” says Godfrey, who’s been with the company since 1990, its final year as Soho Poly.By the mid-90s, after a stint at Cockpit theatre, Soho theatre was homeless. Fortuitously, the national lottery was emerging. With director Abigail Morris and producer David Aukin, Godfrey found a building on Dean Street that had formerly housed a synagogue. The vision was influenced by the diversity and collective spirit of the south London theatre Ovalhouse, the ICA’s punk aesthetics and experimental performances, the fun of comedy clubs. Rather than one artistic director, Soho has “a plurality of voices”, Godfrey says. “They love the work,” says performance artist Bryony Kimmings. “In the curating of their programme, they’re also artists.”View image in fullscreenBaby Reindeer creator Richard Gadd in his show Monkey See, Monkey Do in 2016.Photograph: Soho theatreThose voices now include creative associate Pooja Sivaraman and head of comedy Steve Lock.Comedyis now a core part of Soho’s identity. In 2000, short-ish plays meant Dean Street’s stages were free by 9pm, so mixed-bill comedy, then eventually solo standup shows, filled the gap.Lock started working on the box office in 2001, but soon moved into comedy programming, scouting experimental shows at the fringe, and programming things crowds couldn’t find at comedy clubs. “It was about full-length shows, which intrinsically felt more theatrical. We started to feel like the natural home for people’s one-hour shows in the early 2000s, and it’s snowballed from then.” Soho welcomed American drag performers such as Kiki and Herb, plus acts such as Hannah Gadsby before their rise to fame.For the first 10 years at Dean Street, the basement was an Indian restaurant, which also ran the ground-floor bar. In 2011, it became Soho Theatre Bar, and the basement became a bespoke cabaret space. They decided “to give equal importance to theatre, comedy and cabaret”, Godfrey says.Lock points to artists like Kimmings and Noble, who could never be squeezed into one box. Temi Wilkey, whose recent show Main Character Energy blended performance styles, says: “It’s an extraordinary space for people whose work is genre-pushing.” Kimmings says: “They never say no. They trust you to be creative.” When I ask artists what sets Soho theatre apart from other institutions, many say community. Associate artists used to be given membership to the Groucho Club, but when the theatre started running the bar, this was swapped for bar discounts instead. The idea was to build a club-like atmosphere right there.When you enter Dean Street’s bar now, chances are you’ll recognise someone – it’s a “snipers’ alley” per one TV producer’s analogy; you’re always in the eyeline of an artist, writer, agent. For punters, this means the chance to spot a star.Social media was abuzzin 2023 when Florence Pugh, Andrew Garfield and Phoebe Bridgers were snapped after attending Kate Berlant’s show.It helps that many of the artists connected to Soho arrived as fledging talent, such as Waller-Bridge, growing within the theatre, before achieving mainstream status. Kimmings had never visited Soho theatre until a meeting to discuss the transfer of her 2010 fringe show Sex Idiot, a tale of chlamydia and reappraising relationships. She’s spoken in the past about the snobbery and classism that can come with traditional theatre. Soho is “not like that at all”, she says. Meeting Lock and dramaturg Nina Steiger: “The two of them felt like family, like home, immediately,” Kimmings says. They earned her respect. “[Steiger] taught me how to use the principles of narratives, that was so exciting to me,” she says, and she saw Lock’s passion for new work. When she wanted to make another show – an exploration of alcohol and creativity – they gave her space to develop and she wanted their input. Kimmings now teaches young artists and says most dream of staging their work at Soho. “It’s managed to establish a mark of quality and experimentalism.It feels like if you’re there, you’re original, you’re good quality.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It seemed like “a cool place”, but not for her. “Brown women, south Asian people, the theatre space doesn’t really feel like ours,” she says. Jay and co-host Rubina Pabani were invited to create a stage version of their podcast, which they developed at Dean Street into a theatrical mix of jokes, sketches and discussion of sexuality and cultural expectations. Despite initial fears of not belonging, she says the theatre is “embracing of talent and people from other backgrounds. It’s completely different to how I always imagined theatre spaces to be.”While many artists are scouted, Soho theatre also runs “labs” to coach new talent. Comedians Jack Rooke and Olga Koch started in the comedy programme and playwright Ryan Calais Cameron in the writers’ lab. Rooke, creator of sitcom Big Boys, remembers the comedy lab as “the most valuable education I’ve ever had. One day would be being taught how to apply to go to the fringe by Richard Gadd, the next week we’d have a masterclass with the DryWrite team,” he says. “It taught me to be OK with putting darkness and silliness next to each other.”It led to the live show Good Grief, about the aftermath of his dad’s death, and two subsequent shows, the seeds of Big Boys. He commemorated Soho’s role in his career by naming a Big Boys’ character after staff member Jules Haworth, who helped him secure a comedy lab bursary. Soho got TV commissioners in the door, Rooke says: “It’s always been good at taking a risk on new talent and not just following where the buzz is.”View image in fullscreenSteffen Hanes and Natalie Palamides in Stamptown at the Soho theatre, 2024.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn the upstairs studio, Sivaraman describes the importance of the labs while in the background performer Shafeeq Shajahan rehearses The Bollywood Guide to Revenge. “Shafeeq started on the writers’ lab and drag lab, and this show was programmed as part of Soho Rising [a new talent festival] last year. Now it has a one-week run.” With the opening of Soho Theatre Walthamstow, there’s potential to reach a larger stage. Palamides, who’s worked with Soho since her debut show Laid, will be the first to grace the beautifully restored theatre with Weer, her absurd 90s romcom that earned plaudits in Edinburgh. Jay will perform Brown Girls Do It Too later in the year – as a Walthamstow local, she saw films in the venue as a teen, so it feels like a full-circle moment. In the autumn, Kimmings will present Bog Witch, about rediscovering nature, her first show in more than five years: “I don’t think I could’ve done it with anybody else.”It’s been nearly 15 years since Godfrey joined the fight to transform the Walthamstow venue, which nearly became a church, into a functioning theatre. With the launch imminent, he reflects on Soho’s origins. “One of the challenges is: how do you become a bigger organisation and still keep that queer-punk, radical-fringe core identity?”‘A sight to behold!’ Soho Theatre Walthamstow brings live performance back to historic venueRead moreThey hope that “plurality of voices” in the theatre’s artistic team and the relationships they’ve built with artists over the years will preserve the Soho spirit. In the early days of Dean Street, the company was “under the radar”, says Godfrey, the pressure was off and creativity flowed. Will it be easier to fill an auditorium now on the cachet of Soho’s past successes, or will people expect mainstream acts from a larger venue? Alongside the company’s usual genre-melding works, tickets are already on sale for a pantomime and shows from Jon Ronson and Adam Kay. “We believe it will work, but it will be nice when you actually see it.”During the redevelopment, there was some criticism over theloss of local LGBTQ+ venue The Victoria, which adjoins the site, but there has also been local outreach work. There are new labs programmes for Walthamstow locals, and many of the staff, including Godfrey and Soho Theatre Walthamstow co-chair Alessandro Babalola are locals themselves. Growing affection and audiences among residents, as well as persuading others to make the journey out, will be crucial.Memories formed at Dean Street might hold lessons in how to retain the theatre’s identity. Kimmings laughs as she recalls one night in the cabaret basement, when an audience member bit her leg and she ended her show dancing on stage next to Juliette Lewis. To her, Soho theatre is “a place where you get to be free. A place where you can cast off your baggage and really belly laugh. That is so precious.”Soho Theatre Walthamstow opens on 2 May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatreSoho TheatrePhoebe Waller-BridgeFleabagComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)featuresShareReuse this content"

Lenin and Stalin, their faces’ photographs fixed on jerky figures made from scraps, transforming sporadically into living dancers hidden under collaged costumes, monstrously dominate a puppet cast that also includes the bullish-looking but revolutionary poet Vladimir Mayakovsky along with Trotsky and Shostakovich himself.It would be stirring in an art gallery with recorded music, but on a big screen in the Royal Festival Hall above Marin Alsop conducting a gripping performance by the Philharmonia Orchestra as part of the Southbank’s Centre’smultidisciplinary Multitudes festival, it became a magic key to both the music and the age of betrayal and mass murder it witnesses.The brilliance of Kentridge’s film is that it makes you feel the majesty and pathos of this music from the darkest times of the 20th centuryShostakovich said of his 10th Symphony, “It’s about Stalin and the Stalin years” – as blunt an explanation of a work you’re ever likely to hear from a composer. It was premiered in December 1953 following Stalin’s death in March that year, freeing Shostakovich and other musicians from the dictator’s unbearably attentive grip – except poor Prokofiev, who died the same day as Stalin. So many had died, including Kentridge’s artistic hero Mayakovsky, who shot himself in 1930 as illusions collapsed about Stalin’s meat-factory regime.Biographers and musicologists argue over Shostakovich’s apparently political symphony – did he write it all after Stalin died? The brilliance of Kentridge’s film, perfectly in sync with each unnerving crescendo and melancholy trough, is that it makes you see through such quibbles and feel the majesty and pathos of this music from the darkest times of the 20th century.View image in fullscreen‘A magic key to both the music and the age of betrayal and mass murder it witnesses.’ Oh to Believe in Another World at the Royal Festival Hall, London.Photograph: Pete WoodheadThe crux of discomfort came in the painfully fast second movement alongside rapidly edited, montage-manic images and proclamations such as “Comrade life, march faster!” and “We’ll chase humanity into happiness with an iron fist!” These futuristic lines by Mayakovsky became all too bloodily real when Stalin started the Five-Year Plans in 1928, to speed up economic history by enforced collectivisation and slave labour, along with purges that killed millions.Kentridge’s film opens with lyrical photographs of revolutionary crowds in 1917, but more and more faces are then ringed with pen as if marked by Stalin for death. As the title implies, his film sees the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in 1917 as the birth of a failed utopia, but a failed utopia is still a glimpse of hope.Archival discoveries after the fall of the USSR have revealed a bleaker picture of Lenin and his party. But the artists inspired by 1917 certainly did think they were building utopia and it is their aesthetic disruptions, from Mayakovsky’s futurist lines to the art of Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitzky and Kazimir Malevich and the radical film editing of Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov that give Kentridge’s film its energy.But it’s all ironised. A hand reaches into the Museum of Stalinism to reveal this immersive, labyrinthine space is actually just a small model made from cardboard. All the brave pronouncements are the jerky bombast of tiny puppets. And it ends in a graveyard. In the same way, echoes of modernist music in Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony are framed by quotation marks. You are left with an infinitely sad and traumatised lyricism as Shostakovich and Kentridge remember the millions of Russians, Ukrainians and other nationalities slaughtered by the world’s first Communist state between 1917 and 1953.

As the 98-minute Disney+ documentary Flintoff begins, we find its subject sitting in a hospital room. He can’t feel his lip, the one that was torn from his face in a nightmarish car accident on theTop Geartrack in 2022. But more than that, he is mentally checked out. As one doctor after another tells him that he is recovering well and looking good, he stares at the ground dejectedly. He just wants everyone to stop sugarcoating everything and tell him the truth, he says. What he wants to hear is that he looks like “a fucking mess”.Flintoff was designed as the big unveiling of the new, post-accident Freddie Flintoff. His days as a cricketing prodigy are over and so, it seems, are his days as a permanent light entertainment fixture. He is older, slower and more reflective. He is also plagued, night after night, by looping footage of the accident thatended Top Gear. Ostensibly this is where we’ll get to watch his comeback.But a few things stand in the way of that. The first and most glaring is that Flintoff’s comeback has already been conducted in public. This documentary is preceded by two others –Freddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams on Tourand Freddie Flintoff: Living With Bulimia – that already covered a lot of its ground. Oddly, both of those shows and this were all made by the same production company. More recently Flintoff hosted last year’s Bullseye Christmas special, which undermines the central question in Flintoff of whether he’ll be able to pull himself back from the brink.The second problem is the format. To watch the Freddie Flintoff story told in a film is to realise that it would have made an incredible series. Very few people have had a life as spectacular. He was a blazingly talented cricketer from the off, burly and powerful and fast and charismatic, which gave him enough of a platform to transcend the sport. But he could also be his own worst enemy; a hard-drinking lad’s lad who brought shame upon the England team by – of all things –getting hammered and falling off a pedalo. He retired from cricket and lost his way again, before finding even greater fame as the host of multiple television programmes. He was brought in to save Top Gear, the jewel in the BBC’s crown, before the accident that sent him into retreat from the public.View image in fullscreenEngland cricketers (left to right) Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Flintoff during the team’s Ashes victory parade around London, 2005.Photograph: Philip Brown/ECB/PATold chronologically, with an episode dedicated to each chapter, Flintoff could have been a definitive deep-dive into an effortlessly compelling character. Instead, though, the film whiplashes backwards and forwards in time. Really, the hook of the thing is the crash and its aftermath, which Flintoff has largely kept to himself. But every time he starts to open up about the loneliness he felt, or the fear of frightening his children with his scars, we’re hauled back to a golden-days segment about the 2005 Ashes, or a talking heads clip of James Corden discussingA League of Their Own. It’s a profoundly frustrating way to tell a story.And then there is Flintoff himself. At one point in the film he is asked if he prefers to be called Freddie or Andrew, and jokes that there are two of him, or “maybe more”. This is extremely evident here. One of the things that makes him stand out from most of his peers is his readiness to discuss the hard topics. He is incredibly open about the pressures of fame, his eating disorders, and the PTSD that his crash understandably left him with. But he slams down the shutters at speed whenever he isn’t comfortable.This is most evident when he’s asked about his Top Gear co-hosts, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris. Harris has spoken publicly about the crash before, but not here. This, it turns out, may have something to do with Flintoff essentially cutting off contact with them, partly out of shame at how the crash affected their careers. Even the fact that Flintoff is a Disney+ film, when he’s one of the faces of the BBC, speaks to a level of unhealed trauma that he refuses to broach here.Make no mistake, Freddie Flintoff is a fascinating man and it’s clear that his story is far from over. Had this film been afforded a little more time and distance, it could have been something very special. As it is, though, it may be for fans only.Flintoff is on Disney+ nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryAndrew FlintoffCricketTop GearFactual TVPost-traumatic stress disorderreviewsShareReuse this content"

A former firefighter who went on to enlist in the US Navy, he only picked up a guitar five years ago to entertain his fellow troops when they were locked down in barracks during the pandemic. On his return to the US, he began working for a cement company while posting clips of covers and his own songs to social media: one attracted the attention of Samuel L Jackson, who reposted it to his 9 million followers. Within a few months, Culpepper had both a record deal and a co-sign from another navy veteran, country star Zach Bryan. By the end of last year, Culpepper was performing at Nashville’s legendary Grand Ole Opry.Kashus Culpepper: After Me – videoIt’s obvious why his career has been fast-tracked. The handful of songs he’s released so far take a smart, often witty route through the classic Nashville topics of romantic despair, boozing and the struggles of everyday life, performed in a style he classifies as “southern sounds”, based on “the music in the cars on the freeway, in the restaurants and in the churches” in his home town of Alexander City, Alabama. More traditional and rootsy than the current wave of country-pop, it flits between country, blues, soul, folk and southern rock, occasionally over the course of a single song, as on 2024’s Out of My Mind. Most importantly, Culpepper has an incredible voice: raw, vulnerable, the product of an upbringing in a Baptist church. He’s referred to his approach to performance as “singing like it’s my last day on Earth”, but his future looks assured.Alexis PetridisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenZara Larsson.Photograph: IBL/REX/ShutterstockSL – ParanoiaThe balaclava’d south London MC has such endearingly musical inflections to his raps – quizzical then crestfallen – even when slowly rolling through a brooding, smoke-filled track like this.Durand Jones & the Indications – Flower MoonThe classic soul revivalists’ drummer Aaron Frazer takes the lead vocal here, with doo-wop levels of harmonised romance over a funk backing as crisp yet soft as a hearthside rug.Zara Larsson – Pretty UglyReminiscent of glorious high-street-nightclub trash such as Hollaback Girl, Like a G6 and Christina Aguilera’s Dirty, the Swede’s return has the dizzy buzz of a Wednesday-evening round of shots.Full of Hell – Knight’s OathRelatively clean and accessible business here from the returning grindcore band – which is to say that despite the big, bright riffing, it’s still got its fair share of hellacious screaming.Kara-Lis Coverdale – FreedomTrumpet lines wobble in heat haze and French horns sound hopeful notes through an almost tropically lush wall of strings and synthesised sound: another imaginative work by the Montreal composer.Quadeca – MondayOnce a YouTuber and video-game commentator, then a rapper and now a singer-songwriter, Quadeca tries to get through a rocky relationship patch over Sufjan-leaning cellos, flutes and more.Annea Lockwood – On Fractured GroundThe octogenarian NZ composer visited the peace walls that divided zones in Belfast, “playing” them with hands, leaves and stones: history shivers through this nape-prickling work.Ben Beaumont-Thomas and Rachel KeenanSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistCountryPop and rockExperimental musicSoulRapfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I downloaded Couch to 5k again, joined my local parkrun in Whitley Bay, and have gradually built up my distance since. An active friendship group and a desire to feel great on my wedding day kept me motivated, even through brutal north-east winters.I now run weekly with a friend around town and along the seafront. We’ve got a rule: it doesn’t matter how far or how fast – we just have to show up. It’s kept us accountable. Occasionally, I’ll squeeze in a solo run when work is quiet.I upgraded to proper running trainers for my first organised 10k, along the seafront from North Shields to St Mary’s Island, choosing the Hoka Clifton 9 Gore-Tex – as recommended by my keen runner husband. They’re waterproof, understated and feel like running on springs. A year on, after countless muddy miles, they still look box fresh.Laura, Whitley BayThe best road running shoesView image in fullscreenMount to Coast R1Men’s£150 at Mount to CoastWomen’s£150 at Mount to CoastI do a lot of running – I recently ran 1,400 miles around Ireland – and while I love trails, I often find myself running long distances on the roads. My go-to shoe for anything over about 10 miles is the Mount to Coast R1. These shoes feel light on your feet, but at the same time they’re super durable. I have two pairs and have run hundreds of miles in them and they’re both still full of life.The dual lacing system is clever in that it allows plenty of room for my toes to move around – important for running, since the toes do a lot of the work – while at the same time giving the shoes a nice snug fit. Sometimes with running shoes you don’t know exactly why you like them, but when it comes to setting out on a long run these days, I usually find myself reaching for my R1s.Adharanand, TotnesView image in fullscreenNew Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v14Men’s£160 at New Balance£130 at EndWomen’s£160 at New Balance£160 at SchuhFor someone focused on longer distances on the road, from 10-milers to marathons, having a reliable daily trainer is crucial. For me, that’s always been the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080. They’re durable and comfortable enough for three-hour training runs yet offer great energy return underfoot – almost springboard-like. What I love about the 1080s is consistency. Now on their 14th iteration, they’ve evolved with small tweaks but remain versatile, dependable daily trainers that just work. It doesn’t hurt that they look great, too.Tayler, PortsmouthThe best running shoes for PB chasersView image in fullscreenAdidas Adizero Adios Pro 3Men’sFrom £136 at Kicks CrewWomen’sFrom £117 at Kicks CrewThe Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 is my go-to race shoe for distances from 5k to marathon. Compared with regular trainers, they help me hold faster paces, thanks to their thoughtful construction. In fact, they helped me take 22 minutes off my marathon PB in six months: from 3hrs 20mins at Manchester to 2hrs 58mins at Yorkshire.The Lightstrike Pro foam is relatively firm, offering the support I appreciate as a taller runner. However, that sacrifices a bit of “pop”, making them better suited for long races. The Continental rubber outsole helps my confidence in wet conditions, and after nearly 300 miles, is still holding up well.Durability is another strength. Once retired from racing, older pairs handle track sessions and tempo runs with ease, with the thicker foam providing great leg protection. The carbon rods in the Pro 3 offer a smoother, less aggressive feel than plates, making it a brilliant entry point into the supershoe world and avoiding the downsides of full-on carbon plates for regular training.James, TynemouthThe best trail running shoesView image in fullscreenAsics Trabuco Max 4Men’s£160 at Asics£160 at EndWomen’s£160 at Asics£159.99 at Sports ShoesFor long trail runs, my go-to shoes are the Asics Trabuco Max. I live in Stockholm, so most of my runs are in the forest with some snow in the winter. I’ve also done some running in the Pyrenees. The grip is reliable, the cushioning hits the sweet spot and, as a “hybrid” shoe, they handle flat sections comfortably while absorbing impact on tougher terrain. Plus, I’m a fan of the design – functional without sacrificing style.On a long race, there are always uncertainties – is the weather going to cooperate? How will I be feeling on the day? So, knowing I can trust my shoes gives me one less thing to worry about. In the future, I may experiment with lighter, faster options for racing, but the Trabuco Max will always have a place in my rotation for training.Sophie, StockholmThe best running shoes for marathonsView image in fullscreenAdidas Adizero Adios Pro 4Men’s£220 at AdidasWomen’s£220 at AdidasI’ve run five marathons and an ultra in recent years. London, Chicago and Berlin to name a few: endurance running is my thing. My marathon shoe rotation includes daily runners, track shoes (Nike Vaporfly 2for ever – I stockpiled when the 3 came out), and race day shoes. Picking a marathon shoe is like finding your glass slipper: you don’t know if it’s “the one” until the race is done.At the Berlin Marathon, the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4 had me flying. They’re fast, comfortable, and in training, I shaved 20+ seconds off my usual pace without trying. I’ll definitely be bulk-buying those.Grace, Londonskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It has a high stack with plenty of cushioning for crushing big miles, but it also includes a nylon plate for improved efficiency and a nice snappy return.It feels responsive when I put the hammer down for my marathon-pace reps, but the cushioning means my legs aren’t ruined when I’m chugging away on long-run days. I also think it’s a great stepping stone if you’re going to be using a carbon-plated shoe on the big day. It gets your legs used to the sensation of running with a plate underfoot without having to rack the miles up on your race-day shoes ahead of time.John, GlasgowThe best shoes for ultra runnersView image in fullscreenBrooks Cascadia18Men’s£135 at BrooksFrom £133.73 at AmazonWomen’s£135 at BrooksFrom £131.21 at AmazonThere’s a mantra among runners: nothing new on race day. Yet it was a new pair of Brooks Cascadia 14s that carried me to my first ultra marathon– the North Downs 50km in 2019, which I finished in 7hrs 26mins. As a road runner who’d found most trail shoes uncomfortable, I took a risk on a shoe I’d never worn before as it was the closest thing out there to a trail version of my trustyBrooks Adrenalineroad shoes.Many years and many miles on, I’ve run everything from double marathons to 100ks in the Cascadia – now on their 18th iteration. They’re sturdy and rugged shoes, not the fastest or most pillowy – I’d go to theCatamountsandCalderasfor those – but they have ample grip for all but the muddiest conditions and have never let me down. They’re the only shoes I’d happily take on a 50k and use straight out of the box.Jonathan, LondonTraining in the cold?

I’m on my third pair now, but still have my original. I also rely on them for everydaywalkingin snow and ice, as the grip is excellent.For road running, I swear by my Altra zero-drop shoes. If you’re not familiar with zero-drop shoes, this means the heel and forefoot are level, promoting a more natural stride. I initially chose them for the wide toe box, which has been a gamechanger for managing arthritis in my toes. Over time, I’ve fully adapted to the zero-drop style and haven’t looked back. They’ve been a reliable companion for all my road miles, offering much-needed comfort and support!Sam, NewcastleThe best running shoes for IronmansView image in fullscreenHoka Cielo X1Unisex£250 at Hoka£174.95 at Sports ShoesAs a full-time photography lecturer juggling Ironman triathlon training, I need gear that works hard. My go-to race and speed session shoes are the Hoka Cielo X1, especially for hot climates. Their breathable knit upper helps keep my feet cool, which is crucial for races like Roth and Kona, two Ironman triathlons (1.2-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and a marathon, back to back) in Bavaria and Hawaii respectively.The Cielo X1 also excel for comfort during long distances. With a 39mm stack height and dual-layer Peba foam sole, they provide plenty of cushioning while the carbon plate adds a propulsive, race-ready feel. This is a life-saver in the back half of the marathon. The only tweak I make is swapping the laces for elastic ones to speed up transitions – every second counts.Jamie, North Yorkshire‘I’d never head out without one’: 10 hiking essentialsRead moreThe best shoes for overpronatorsView image in fullscreenAsics Gel Kayano 29Men’s£105 at Asics Outlet£99.99 at Sports ShoesWomen’s£105 at Asics Outlet£99.99 at Sports ShoesFor nearly a decade, my go-to shoes have been the Asics Gel Kayano. They started as my all-purpose shoe but are now my core choice for easy and recovery runs. When I began taking running seriously, I faced all the classic beginner injuries: shin splints, sore knees and achilles pain. A gait analysis revealed I overpronate, and after testing several options, the Gel Kayano stood out as the most comfortable and balanced.The 4D guidance system improved my stride, as seen in more even wear patterns compared with my old shoes. Combined with the gel cushioning, this reduced impact, sped up recovery times and allowed me to train more consistently – leading to quicker gains. While now my training shoe, they’re still race-capable, offering responsive foam with solid support. The versatility and injury prevention make them a classic, now in their 31st iteration, with a well-earned fanbase.Rory, KendalPaddy Maddison is a freelance consumer journalist, outerwear enthusiast and exercise addict.

By morning it was even worseDeborah CobbFri 25 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 12.17 EDTShareIt was a cool May afternoon in 2002. I was 19 and had driven to Westport beach in Washington with a few friends to enjoy a day by the ocean.As a child, I’d been a keen gymnast, always doing backflips and energetic routines. As I got older, I still had a habit of doing cartwheels whenever I found an open space. That day on the beach, on the soft, flat sand, I couldn’t resist.I ended up doing 13 in a row, collapsing into giggles afterwards. My friend ran over to help me up, laughing, too. Overcome with dizziness, I noticed something strange: I couldn’t see my friend’s face. It was an orange blur. My peripheral vision seemed normal, but when I focused directly on her, there were no details. I shook my head, but the sensation didn’t fade.We joked that maybe I needed to do 13 cartwheels in the opposite direction to unscramble my brain. I lay down on a blanket and we stayed at the beach for another hour or so, but my eyesight wasn’t getting any better. I was a little concerned, but tried to stay calm. I wasn’t in any pain and told my friends not to worry.I began to panic only when we wandered along a shopping street later that day and I found it difficult to read even simple signs. Every time I tried to focus on text or details, the same orange blur obscured my vision. When I got home in the evening, I told my mum what had happened. She was concerned and said if it was still bad in the morning, we’d go to the hospital. I tried to convince myself that sleep might help.But the next morning, it felt even worse. My stepdad noticed that I was struggling with basic tasks and took me to the emergency room. After examining my eyes, the doctors’ initial diagnosis was that I had sustained sun damage to my retinas and it might take a couple of weeks to heal. Hearing this was distressing, especially with my final exams looming.It turned out to be even worse than I feared. After consulting an ophthalmologist, it transpired that I had ruptured blood vessels in my macula, the central part of the retina responsible for detailed vision. The amount of blood was small – like a tiny ink dot – but enough to block my central vision. She said it would take far longer than two weeks to heal: if I was lucky, I might be able to see again in three months. I was legally blind – I wouldn’t be able to drive, finish my studies or watch TV. I was devastated.Experience: I’m allergic to nearly everythingRead moreI was forced to rely on others for simple tasks, such as making lunch or sending a text. I hardly left the house. My friends rallied round and I tried to stay positive, but it was hard.It took a long time, but the blood gradually reabsorbed and my sight slowly began to improve. Three months later, my central vision returned. Still, the experience had a lasting impact. I developed early-onset macular degeneration – a condition that, at 42, leaves me with the eyes of an 80-year-old.In the years that followed, I experienced milder episodes of vision loss. On one occasion, it happened during a spirited singalong in the car with a friend, but just for a few days; another time, while I was weeding blackberry bushes.When I became pregnant, I was advised that the strain of labour could trigger another episode. I opted for a scheduled C-section – I couldn’t bear the thought of not being able to see my son for the first few months of his life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

My grandmother told me that a similar issue had affected a distant family member, suggesting that it might be genetic.For now, doctors are monitoring my condition carefully, but there’s a risk the complications could return. I can’t bear the thought of what I’d miss if I lost my eyesight for ever. I’m more cautious doing physical activity and avoid anything that might cause a rush of blood to my head.It’s now been more than two decades since I attempted a cartwheel. At times, I miss it. But some things simply aren’t worth the risk, no matter how joyful they once felt.As told to Sophie HaydockDo you have an experience to share?

This trend has since reversed with more employers asking workers to return to office working.Here, three people in the UK tell us about their decisions to relocate, and whether city or rural life suits them better.‘What we gained didn’t match where we were in life’Jasmin Perry and her husband, Tom, both 28, knew very quickly after moving into their new house in a small village near Bath that they had made a mistake. “We didn’t quite think through how it would change our lives – I think we might’ve been a bit naive,” said Jasmin who works as a product marketing manager.View image in fullscreenJasmin and Tom Perry moved to a small village near Bath in 2022. The reality left them feeling they ‘didn’t think through how it would change our lives’.Photograph: Jasmin Perry/Guardian CommunityBefore moving to Somerset in 2022, they rented a flat in northLondonfor a year. Wanting to buy their first property and finding the city unaffordable, they were swayed by a three-bedroom house on a new-build development. “We thought it would be peaceful, quaint and idyllic – but it wasn’t,” she added.The couple thought living rurally would mean they could run and cycle easily but Jasmin found they had to “drive everywhere” and she was “scared of getting hit” while cycling on country roads. They rarely sat in their garden due to noise from a nearby dual carriageway, and they had no local amenities close by. “The small village didn’t even have a shop,” she said. “We gave it a shot, but the longer we lived there we realised we didn’t feel happy.”In July 2023, they put their house on the market and six months later moved to a two-bedroom flat in a converted pub in Twickenham, south west London. Desperate to move back, the couple sold their house for £20,000 less than they bought it.“Our house just didn’t feel like home,” said Jasmin. “We felt like we’d lost so much and what we gained didn’t match where we were in life.“Every day since moving back to London I’m grateful as our mental health is better and we’re much happier. London just has everything for me. There’s so much vitality and it’s a melting pot. We have access to beautiful parks, a rich cultural life and I feel connected to life again. If we move, it will only be a few streets over. We don’t have that itchy feet feeling any more.”‘We have a wonderful home but it’s made every part of our lives more difficult’For Alison, living in Greater Manchester was “pretty stressful” with a young family and no relatives on hand to help. She and her husband moved to their four-bedroom semi-detached house in Ramsbottom just months before the Covid pandemic. “We didn’t see much of the area for two years and when our first child was born in 2021, it felt like three years of lockdown as no one would visit,” said the 42-year-old solicitor.Though the couple discovered a “thriving” community, in 2024 Alison was made redundant after returning from maternity leave and the family felt it was a good time to relocate nearer to their relatives in Pendle, Lancashire. Both Alison and her husband grew up in the area and thought returning would be a good move. “We have a beautiful, old, converted farmhouse in a tiny hamlet,” she said.Despite having a “wonderful family home”, the move, Alison said, has made “every part of our lives more difficult”. Previously a 20-minute drive down the motorway to visit family, they now have a 10-minute journey on single track roads “over hills and dales where traffic is a pain”. Travelling to nursery and for medical appointments takes longer and they can’t just “pop to the shops”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I think I have a more metropolitan outlook now and if we found the right place, we might move back nearer to the city in a year or two.”‘At this point in my life I need to see more trees and less concrete’View image in fullscreenJane and her husband have settled for something in between after living in cities and more rural locations.Photograph: Jane/Guardian CommunityOn the other hand, after living both in cities and more rural locations, Jane, 71, has settled on somewhere in between. The author, who is originally from Canada and moved to the UK when she married her husband nearly 30 years ago, has lived in various places.“We lived near the coast in Devon after hearing all about how lovely it would be – but the seaside doesn’t always deliver,” she said. “I did join the community (or tried to) – the local church was welcoming.”They now live in Bristol but after eight years they’re moving to a town in Norfolk. “The cars banked up on both sides of narrow residential streets, the graffiti and living so close to your neighbours but not really knowing them – I’ve had it.“Long ago I would have totally said I’m a city person because I gobble up culture, but I don’t know if it’s my age but I get fed up with people and like my privacy.

Whose turn is it to pick up the kids? And why do you insist on doing that thing you do when you know how much it annoys me? No honestly, don’t worry, I’mfine.Perhaps – if you are part of a long-term couple – that kind of conversation sounds familiar. Or perhaps you areGeorgeandAmal Clooneyand you never, ever argue. That, at least, wasthe actor’s boastthis week to a US morning show: in almost 12 years of marriage, he said, he and his lawyer wife have never had a single argument. “We’re trying to find something to argue about,” he joked.Can it really be possible to commit to someone long enough for the pheromones to wear off and not, every now and then, have a row about money, parenting or who was supposed to sort the car tax? And even if it is possible – is it healthy? The Clooneys’ blissful marriage may be one thing, but for the rest of us, say experts, arguing need not be such a bad thing – so long as we’re doing it right.“People are drawn into thinking that lots of conflict is a sign that there’s something wrong with a relationship, and an absence of conflict means there isn’t something wrong,” says the couples therapist Joanna Harrison, whose book on the subject is titledFive Arguments All Couples (Need to) Have and Why the Washing-up Matters. “But often when conflict is avoided, those feelings are building up and creating resentments or finding outlets elsewhere, and that can be problematic.”Obviously, not every domestic dispute is a positive one. “Arguments that leave people feeling unsafe or put people at risk, or that are hostile, frequent or unresolved, particularly if there are children – these are not healthy arguments,” she says. But when it comes to the everyday conflicts and annoyances of a long-term relationship, thrashing out the issues that wind you up about each other is often not just normal, but necessary.“Actually, arguing is a great skill for couples,” agrees Stefan Walters of the psychotherapy service Harley Therapy. Research has shown that over many years, “couples who do argue actually end up staying together much more than couples who don’t”, he says.View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney said recently that he and his wife, Amal, have not had an argument in almost 12 years of marriage.Photograph: Luca Carlino/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockThe good news is we can get better at it, says Walters. “It’s a skill that we need to practise and learn. For many of us, unfortunately, it wasn’t modelled for us very effectively in our childhood. We may have seen parents who were either avoidant with each other or who just shouted at each other. But we can practise and we develop tools that help make that better.”But how? The most important thing – though by no means the most easy – is to stop trying to win, says theclinical psychologistandagony auntLinda Blair. “This is not a contest. This is [about] how to understand each other better. When we get emotional, we think in black and white: we win or we lose, we’re right or wrong. You need to find the compromise.”A few practical things can make the process easier, she says. Blair often suggests warring couples have their heated debate somewhere public. “Go for dinner, for example, because you’re less likely to start shouting. When we stay calmer, we’re able to see the grey between the blacks and the whites,” she says.Another tip is to go for a walk or talk side by side, so you’re not making eye contact – “that, in all mammals, is taken as a threat” – and try to approach things when you are both calm, says Blair. “All those things will, without your trying, [help you] come up with a solution which is not perfect for either of you, but the closest you can get.”Ultimately, having a good blowout can be a way of building up trust in each other, says Harrison. She advises viewing a row as “an opportunity to learn something about what your partner cares about”.The zero-argument marriage: have the Clooneys found the secret of a happy life?Read moreThat will include making a bit of effort to repair things once everyone has calmed down. “After the dust has settled a bit, perhaps you can go back in and be curious. What was that really about? Try to be a bit of a detective about it. ‘I’m struggling to understand what it was about leaving my shoes there that made you so upset with me. Was it just about the shoes?’”How to argueDoChoose your moment. “Timing is everything when you want to talk about a difficult topic,” says Harrison. Instead of blurting out a grievance when everyone is busy, she says, “have a conversation about having a conversation. Is there a time that we could talk about this issue?”Be curious. “Be sure you are asking questions, you’re not trying to dominate,” says Blair.Take responsibility. “Don’t say, ‘you make me angry’,” says Blair. “Say, ‘I feel angry when you …’”Take a step back if things are becoming too heated. “If things feel like they are really escalating, that’s a sign to pause the conversation that is no longer a conversation,” says Harrison. Agree to come back to it later when everyone has cooled down.Don’tTry to win all the time. Try to make the problem your mutual enemy.Store up grievances as ammunition to use later. If now isn’t a good time to thrash things out, “I think there should be a promise that it’s done within 24 hours,” says Walters.While it can be helpful to model conflict resolution for your children, says Harrison, don’t have blazing rows in front of them.Don’t show contempt, even in the heat of the moment, as it’s much harder to repair in the aftermath, says Blair. “You’re not better than they are.”Explore more on these topicsRelationshipsGeorge ClooneyAmal ClooneyMarriageFamilynewsShareReuse this content"

This has been shown by the increasing age of guardians signing up, going into their 40s and 50s,” said Arthur Duke, the founder and managing director of Live-in Guardians, a company that manages vacant properties and connects property owners with guardians.Williams’s main room, complete with two home offices, a lounge area and enough empty floor space to cartwheel across three times, has the vibe of a bohemian, Manhattan-style loft apartment yet remnants of the property’s past life, including fire escape signs and a wall full of plug sockets, are everywhere.“For me, it’s part of the appeal. I like the weird and the offbeat: the hand sanitiser, the whiteboard … the fact that a lot of these places you would walk past and not know they’re there,” said Williams, who works for a tech company.View image in fullscreenLuke Williams outside his Live-in Guardians accommodation.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianDemand for guardianships has rocketed in recent years. Previous property guardians hosted by Duke’s company include former professional footballers, engineers, journalists, doctors, police officers and people working for the UN.“We’ve even had a Bafta and Cannes film festival-winning documentary producer who lived in a former church” said Duke.Daisy Mangan, 25, who works in insurance, and Rebecca Ludden, 24, a trainee lawyer, live together in a former pub in north-west London. They both came across the property via a post on Instagram.View image in fullscreenDaisy Mangan, left, and Rebecca Ludden in the former London pub they found via a post on Instagram.Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian“I was previously living in zone 4. It was a bit of a commute to work and I just wanted to be somewhere a bit more central,” said Mangan.Like Williams, Mangan and Ludden enjoy the large space, as well as the history and quirks of the building, which is situated close to some of London’s most expensive townhouses. They’re also aware, however, that they could be asked to move out at any moment. Property guardians are typically only given 28 days’ notice to vacate a property.“There are cons, but there are also pros … flexibility is actually quite useful in London. Like, if something were to happen and you’re tied in for a year, it makes it a bit more difficult,” said Mangan.View image in fullscreenThe converted pub on the corner of a north-west London street.Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianWilliams, so far, has been lucky. He’s had his place for one and a half years, and it’s the property that’s felt most like home.“[Live in Guardians] are good at working with you to find a new place … they’re not just like, get out, you’re on the street,” said Williams who has lived in four guardianships including a former classroom and a masonic lodge since 2022.Ian Horton, 61, became a property guardian after selling his home in Dunstable in 2022 due to the uncertainty of Covid and the energy crisis. For the last eight months he has lived in a former pub in Bedford with his partner and two others.“I was curious when the Fox and Hounds appeared as a potential new home. I knew I had to pursue it, even though I had never heard of guardians before, but I’m glad that I did. The big car park is ideal, as I have two vehicles. The large rooms are great for accommodating my stuff, with the bar area downstairs being great for storage,” said Horton.Between 2022 and 2024, the number of applications from people seeking to become property guardians rose by 60% to more than 50,000 per year.Graham Sievers, chair of the PGPA that represents three of the largest guardianship providers, believes the soaring demand is a result of the cost of living crisis and the rising costs of the private rental sector.“Charging rents which take 40% plus of someone’s income is unsustainable. It’s uneconomic and it’s pushing people away from the private rental sector,” said Sievers.“All the stories you hear about 30-year-olds still staying in their parents’ place because they can’t afford to move out … The opportunity for property guardianships is huge … it offers more affordable accommodation on a widespread basis.”Explore more on these topicsRenting propertyPropertyLondonReal estateHousingnewsShareReuse this content"

Hike through mist-draped jungle, swim beneath cascading waterfalls and savour home-cooked meals in cosy cabins, while joining local researchers as they track elusiveAndean bearsand assist with community outreach initiatives. This is genuinely sustainable tourism – protecting one of the planet’s most threatened ecosystems while creating vital income for local families. Pickup trucks are available from Quito, though the local bus journey through the Andean foothills is an unforgettable way to arrive. It’s a truly unique “holiday” – wild, breathtaking and genuinely impactful. Staying at the ecolodge, visitors can also join guided hikes and birdwatching trips. A two-day, one-night stay starts at $190.BobbyOrganic vineyards and biodiversity near BordeauxView image in fullscreenLearn about organic wine-making at Chateau de La Dauphine in Fronsac.Photograph: Nick Maslen/AlamyOn a family holiday to Bordeaux last autumn we noticed that winemakers were increasingly turning to environmentally friendly methods such as biodynamics and having draught horses rather than machines till the soil. We went on an estate tour that was more than just tasting the odd glass of wine. Our guide informed and educated us about the benefits of organic cultivation and winemaking methods, and atChâteau de La Dauphine, we were invited to explore the permaculture vegetables and beehives. At theCaves de Rauzanestate, a biodiversity trail wound its way through the countryside. We toured the vineyards on ebikes hired in Bordeaux.NigelInclusive walking tours in EdinburghView image in fullscreenMercat Tours uses visitor donations for a community initiative.Photograph: Paul BockIn Edinburgh, I was struck byMercat Tours’ Our Stories, Your City – a community initiative funded by visitor donations. It enables disadvantaged residents to experience five-star tours and historic attractions on their doorstep so they encounter first-hand the history which shaped their community – without financial barriers or stigma. This builds a sense of pride and belonging for those excluded, and evidences tourism as a force for good.

The overall performance has perplexed veteran Coalition strategists, frustrated conservative supporters and deflated some MPs, for whom hopes of forming government after 3 May now appear illusory.“Perhaps we’ve been kidding ourselves,” one Liberal source has lamented.Lofty expectationsCoalition insiders concede Dutton’s personal ratings have fallen since Anthony Albanese called the election on28 March. The opposition leader admitted as much atTuesday night’s leaders’ debate, blaming Labor’s “$20m” negative ad blitz for dragging down his vote.The Labor machine has executed a ruthless anti-Dutton campaign, mercilessly peddling claims about $600bn nuclear reactors andshuttered Medicare urgent clinicsthat the Coalition have rejected as bald-faced lies.A week out from polling day theCoalitionis not losing hope, adamant its internal research paints a rosier picture about its prospects, including in marginal seats, than the increasingly grim numbers in published national polls.2:11The election campaign reaches the pointy end as early voting opens - TLDR: Election 2025 - videoThe proportion of undecided voters is still almost 30%, according to some research, making strategists wary of seat-by-seat predictions.“It is closer than the national polls are suggesting,” one senior source says.In Victoria, the opposition remains confident of winning Aston, Chisholm and McEwen and is growing optimistic about its chances in Goldstein, Hawke and Gorton.The Coalition is banking on gaining Bennelong, Gilmore and Paterson in New South Wales and is hopeful in Brisbane in the Queensland capital and Bullwinkel, Tangney and Curtin in WA.Barely a week from election day, Peter Dutton still has the air of someone making it up on the fly | Josh ButlerRead moreWinning those seats would almost certainly be enough to force Labor into a minority government, an outcome the Coalition might have accepted when Albanese was revelling in an extended political honeymoon after the 2022 election.But it would fall short of the lofty expectations that built internally and externally in the 18 months after the voice to parliament referendum, to a point some MPs returned from the Christmas break believing Dutton could defeat a first-term government for thefirst time since 1931.There was a view the global inflation crisis – and 13 interest rate rises domestically – would cruel a lacklustre Albanese government just as it had incumbents around the world, including the US and UK.The high-water mark for optimism was in February, when a poll in theNine newspapersput the Coalition ahead 55-45 on a two-party preferred basis.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterSome Coalition insiders now believe those numbers were “illusionary”, reflective not of rising support for Dutton, or even anger at Albanese, but rather a general reflection of the mood of a fed-up and financially stressed electorate.The Coalition might have “stripped a lot of bark” off Labor in the past 18 months, as one veteran conservative strategist put it, but still needed to offer a reason for voters to “walk across the road to their side”.Flaw in the campaignJust days after Cyclone Alfred forced Albanese tocancel plans for a 12 April election,internal unrestabout the Coalition’s lack of major economic policies spilled out into the public.Dutton and the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, brushed off the “free advice”, which was privately dismissed as the predictable grumbling of agitators with personal agendas.Whatever the motives, the series of articles – including one inGuardian Australia– exposed the bare-bones nature of the Coalition’s agenda.“We were told everything was under control. We were told to give them the benefit of the doubt,” one Coalition source said.Ahead of the 25 March budget, the opposition had no centrepiece cost-of-living relief offering; no short-term plan to reduce power prices; no commitment on defence spending.Dutton’s budget reply dealt with two of those missing pieces, committing to a12-month cut to the fuel exciseand an east coast gas reserve.Aone-off income tax offset of up to $1,200, new first home buyer incentives and a commitment tolift defence spending to 2.5% of GDPover the next five years have also been announced during the campaign.Senior Coalition MPs said the announcements were timed to coincide with voters tuning in to the election debate.View image in fullscreenDutton has made several unforced errors that distracted from his cost-of-living focus, including declaring he would live at Kirribilli House as PM.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPSources confirmed the campaign waited until the past week to pivot to crime and national security because the traditional Coalition strong-suits were unlikely to shift votes.Critics inside and outside the party argue the policies have come too late to be properly explained and understood, particularly given the campaign has overlapped with the Easter and Anzac long weekends.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It just puts a lot of pressure on you to punch through the media cycle,” Tony Barry, a former Liberal strategist now working with RedBridge, told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing.The dearth of fully formed policy created a vacuum for Labor’s negative campaign to shape the election narrative from the start.Dutton also made several unforced errors that distracted from his cost-of-living focus, including declaring he would live at Sydney’sKirribilli House as prime ministerand floating, and quickly walking back, referendums on four-year terms, Indigenous recognition andstripping the citizenship of dual nationals.‘Not ready for government’John Roskam, a senior fellow at rightwing thinktank the Institute of Public Affairs, is a respected figure in Liberal circles who has the ear of conservative MPs in Canberra.“The campaign problems can’t be attributed to any one factor, it’s a combination of complacency … a failure to develop strong policies, the absence of a cultural agenda and a feeling that the Coalition has been too willing to play safe when in fact a bold and ambitious agenda was what was required,” Roskam said.Of the policies that were announced pre-campaign, some haven’t been mentioned (tax deductible lunches), others actively avoided (nuclear power) and others dumped due to their unpopularity.Within a fortnight of theshadow finance minister, Jane Hume, announcing a plan to restrict work-from-home options for public servants, colleagues began privately lobbying for changes amid fears it was being misinterpreted as applying to all workplaces.View image in fullscreenDutton has tried to distance himself from Donald Trump and Elon Musk – and their Maga and Doge agendas.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPLabor and its union allies successfully characterised the policy as an attack on working women, a devastating perception for a party attempting to win back female voters.Dutton waitedalmost five weeksbefore admitting the policy was a “mistake” and jettisoning it entirely. He also walked back plans to sack 41,000 public servants, confirming the headcount would instead be reduced through natural attrition and hiring freezes.On Thursday – withmore than 1m votes already cast– Dutton seemingly shifted again, confirming all 41,000 of those positions would come from Canberra.Responding to the comments,Albanese said publiclywhat he has been saying privately since the start of the campaign.“They are showing, Peter Dutton is showing, that they are just not ready for government,” he said.‘He hasn’t followed his gut’The sense of optimism among Coalition MPs was palpable as Donald Trump swept to victory at November’s US presidential election.Trump had successfully tapped the anger and disillusionment of voters suffering through a cost-of-living crisis, providing what some of Dutton’s colleagues viewed as a template for what could be achieved at the forthcoming Australian election.Trump’s win over Democrat Kamala Harris was also interpreted as further confirmation of a global rejection of “wokeness” – a cause also disdained by Dutton.When the Liberal leader stood up in parliament to congratulate Trump on his victory, an air of confidence filled the opposition benches.“We will make sure that President Trump is not somebody to be scared of,” Dutton said, emphasising the final two words. “But somebody that we can work very closely with, and that’s exactly what we will do.”The “not somebody to be scared of” remark was a barely concealed reference to Albanese’s 2017 admission that Trump“scares the shit out of me”. Dutton was taunting Albanese, implying that he could not only manage Trump’s return but capitalise on it.View image in fullscreenSome Liberals and conservative campaigners lament that voters haven’t seen ‘Dutton be Dutton’.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPFive months on,Dutton is trying to distance himselffrom Trump and Elon Musk, so toxic have parallels with the Maga and Doge agendas become for the Liberal brand.Dutton’s remark at theABC-hosted leaders’ debatethat he didn’t “know” Trump was a statement of fact. But for some conservatives, it was a further sign of an uncharacteristic timidness, or an aversion to risk, that has crept into Dutton’s campaign.Some attribute the safety-first approach to the transfer of power that occurs at each election, where data-led party officials assume greater influence over strategy and messaging.Several sources confirmed reports of friction between Dutton’s inner circle and Liberal HQ, led by Andrew Hirst.Whatever the cause, some Liberals and conservative campaigners lament that voters haven’t seen “Dutton be Dutton”.Roskam agrees.“There is a view [inside the Liberal party] that the public haven’t seen the best of Peter Dutton … that he hasn’t followed his gut.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Peter DuttonCoalitionLiberal partyLiberal National partyAustralian politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The approach is similar to the trade talks, where the intention is for supplicant countries tocome to Washington individually bearing giftsin return for access to US markets.The administration may have felt it had little choice given the urgency, but whether it was wise to launch three such ambitious peace missions,and a global trade war, at the same time is debatable.It is true each of thethree conflictsare discrete in that they have distinctive causes, contexts and dynamics, but they are becoming more intertwined than seemed apparent at the outset, in part because there is so much resistance building in Europe and elsewhere about the world order Donald Trump envisages, and his chosen methods.In diplomacy nothing is hermetically sealed – everything is inter-connected, especially since there is a common thread between the three talks in the personality of the property developer Steven Witkoff, Trump’s great friend who is leading the US talks in each case, flitting from Moscow to Muscat.View image in fullscreenIran’s Hamshahri newspaper, headlined ‘Message of power from Muscat’ and featuring an image of Witkoff, at a kiosk in Tehran this month.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPATo solve these three conflicts simultaneously would be a daunting task for anyone, but it is especially for a man entirely new to diplomacy and, judging by some of his remarks, also equally new to history.Witkoff has strengths, not least that he is trusted by Trump. He also knows the president’s mind – and what should be taken at face value. He is loyal, so much so that he admits he worshipped Trump in New York so profoundly that he wanted to become him. He will not be pursuing any other agenda but the president’s.But he is also stretched, and there are basic issues of competence. Diplomats are reeling from big cuts to the state department budget and there is still an absence of experienced staffers. Witkoff simply does not have the institutional memory available to his opposite numbers in Iran, Israel and Russia. For instance, most of the Iranian negotiating team, led by the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, are veterans of the 2013-15 talks that led to theoriginal Iran nuclear deal.Yuri Ushakov, Vladimir Putin’s chief foreign policy adviser, who attended the first Russian-US talks this year in Saudi Arabia, spent 10 years in the US as Russian ambassador. He was accompanied by Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund who then visited the US on 2 April.In the follow-up talks in Istanbul on 10 April, Aleksandr Darchiev, who has spent 33 years in the Russian foreign ministry and is Russian ambassador to the US, was pitted against a team led by Sonata Coulter, the new deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who does not share Trump’s benign view of Russia.View image in fullscreenA protest in Peshawar, Pakistan, in solidarity with the Palestinian people.Photograph: Arshad Arbab/EPAAs to the Gaza issue,Benjamin Netanyahuhas lived the Palestinian conflict since he became Israel’s ambassador to the UN in 1984.Richard Nephew, a former US Iran negotiator, says the cuts to state department means the US “is at risk of losing a generation of expertise … It’s beyond tragedy. It’s an absolutely devastating national security blow with the evisceration of these folks. The damage could be permanent, we have to acknowledge this.”One withering European diplomat says: “It is as if Witkoff is trying to play three dimensional chess with chess grandmasters on three chessboards simultaneously, not having played the game before.”Bluntly, Witkoff knows he needs to secure a diplomatic win for his impatient boss. But the longer the three conflicts continue, the more entangled they become with one another, the more Trump’s credibility is questioned. Already,according to a Reuters Ipsos poll published this month, 59% of Americans think Trump is costing their country its credibility on the global stage.The risk for Trump is that the decision to address so much so quickly ends up not being a show of American strength but the opposite – the public erosion of a super power.In the hurry to seal a deal with Iran inside two months, Trump, unlike in all previous nuclear talks with Tehran, has barred complicating European interests from the negotiation room.0:40Trump says US will ‘take a pass’ on Ukraine peace deal ‘if parties make it difficult’ – videoTo Iran’s relief, Witkoff has not tabled an agenda that strays beyond stopping Iran acquiring a nuclear bomb. He has not raised Iran’s supply of drones to Russia for use inUkraine. Nor has he tabled demands that Iran end arms supplies to its proxies fighting Israel.That has alarmed Israel, and to a lesser extent Europe, which sees Iran’s desire to have sanctions lifted as a rare opportunity to extract concessions from Tehran. Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, and Mossad’s head, David Barnea, met Witkoff last Friday in Paris to try to persuade him that when he met the Iran negotiating team the next day in Rome, he had todemand the dismantling of Tehran’s civil nuclear programme.Witkoff refused, and amid many contradictory statements the administration has reverted to insisting that Iran import the necessary enriched uranium for its civil nuclear programme, rather than enrich it domestically.Russia, in a sign of Trump’s trust, might again become the repository of Iran’s stocks of highly enriched uranium,as it was after the 2015 deal.Israel is also wary of Trump’s aggrandisement of Russia. The Israeli thinktank INSS published a report this week detailing how Russia, in search of anti-western allies in the global south for its Ukraine war, has shown opportunistic political support not just to Iran but to Hamas.Israelwill also be uneasy if Russia maintains its role in Syria.1:25Trump says US ‘having direct talks’ with Iran over nuclear deal – videoBut if Trump has upset Netanyahu over Iran, he is keeping him sweetby giving him all he asks on Gaza.Initially, Witkoff received glowing accolades about how tough he had been with Netanyahu in his initial meeting in January. It was claimed that Witkoff ordered the Israeli president to meet him on a Saturday breaking the Sabbath and directed him to agree a ceasefire that he had refused to give to Joe Biden’s team for months.As a result, as Trump entered the White House on 19 January,he hailedthe “EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signalled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies”.But Netanyahu, as was widely predicted in the region, found a reason not to open talks on the second phase of the ceasefire deal – the release of the remaining hostages held inGazain exchange for a permanent end to the fighting.Witkoff came up with compromises to extend the ceasefire but Netanyahu rejected them, resuming the assault onHamason 19 March. The US envoy merely described Israel’s decision as “unfortunate, in some respects, but also falls into the had-to-be bucket”.View image in fullscreenEmmanuel Macron, once consideredEurope’s ‘Trump whisperer’, at a diplomatic meeting on Ukraine in Paris last week.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/EPANow Trump’s refusal to put any pressure on Israel to lift its six-week-oldban on aid entering Gazais informing Europe’s rift with Trump. Marking 50 days of the ban this week, France, Germany and the UK issued astrongly worded statementdescribing the denial of aid as intolerable.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is calling for a coordinated European recognition of the state of Palestine, and Saudi Arabia is insisting the USdoes not attack Iran’s nuclear sites.Witkoff, by contrast, has been silent about Gaza’s fate and the collapse of the “EPIC ceasefire”.But if European diplomats think Witkoff was naive in dealing with Netanyahu, it is nothing to the scorn they hold for his handling of Putin.The anger is partly because Europeans had thought that, after the Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s public row with Trump in the Oval Office, they had restored Ukraine’s standing in Washington by persuading Kyiv to back the full ceasefire that the US first proposed on 11 March.View image in fullscreenTrump, Marco Rubio and other members of the president’s administration in talks with Jonas Gahr Støre, Norway’s prime minister (not pictured), in the Oval Office this week.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockThetalks in Paris last week between Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, and European leaders also gave Europe a chance to point out it was Putin that was stalling over a ceasefire.But instead of putting any countervailing pressure onRussiato accept a ceasefire, Witkoff switched strategy. In the words of Bruno Tertrais, a non-resident fellow at the Institut of Montaigne, Witkoff is “is now presenting a final peace plan, very favourable to the aggressor, even before the start of the negotiations, which had been due to take place after a ceasefire”.No European government has yet criticised Trump’s lopsided plan in public since, with few cards to play, the immediate necessity is to try to prevent Trump acting on histhreat to walk away. At the very least, Europe will argue that if Trump wants Ukraine’s resources, he has to back up a European force patrolling a ceasefire, an issue that receives only sketchy reference in the US peace plan.The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, addressing the country’s parliament on Wednesday, pointed to the necessity of these security guarantees. “Any arrangement with the Kremlin will only last so long as the Russian elite dreads the consequences of its breach,” he said.View image in fullscreenTrump made it very clear that he thought Ukraine ‘must be part of Russia’, his former adviser Fiona Hill has said in a new book.Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty ImagesBut in a sense, Trump and Putin,according to Fiona Hillat the Brookings Institution, a Russia specialist in Trump’s first administration, may already have moved beyond the details of their Ukrainian settlement as they focus on their wider plan to restore the Russian-US relationship.It would be an era of great power collusion, not great power competition in which Gaza, Iran and Ukraine would be sites from which the US and Russia could profit.Writing on Truth Social about a phone call with Putin in February, Trump reported” “We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II … We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together.”Witkoff has also mused about what form this cooperation might take. “Shared sea lanes, maybe send [liquefied natural] gas into Europe together, maybe collaborate on AI together,” he said, adding: “Who doesn’t want to see a world like that?”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationInternational tradeDonald TrumpTrump tariffsUS foreign policyGlobal economyEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As the country sat in silence on Thursday to remember 6 million Jews exterminated by the Nazis, the same refrain was, as always, repeated by many: never again.But for some across Israel, as the war inGazacontinues to ravage the Palestinian people and wipe out entire families, never again had come to hold another meaning.As the country’s most powerful politicians, including the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, attended a ceremony on Thursday morning at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, three Holocaust survivors in their 80s stood at the entrance holding a sign aloft: “If we have lost our compassion for the other, we have lost our humanity.”About 40 miles (64km) away in a square in central Tel Aviv, thousands, including descendants of Holocaust survivors, stood holding photos of Palestinian children who had been killed since the war began. Dozens more lined the roads of the city dressed in black, holding out empty pots to symbolise thestarvation of those in Gaza.View image in fullscreenIsraeli demonstrators hold empty pots to represent the starvation in Gaza in Tel Aviv on the day Israel marks Holocaust Remembrance Day.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianIn recent months, particularly since the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed in March, the country has been rocked by protests. These demonstrations have loudly called for an end to the war in the name of saving the remaining Israeli hostages left in Gaza, 24 who are still believed to be alive, and to bring back the bodies of the 35 dead. Yet starkly absent has been mention of the suffering and devastation being brought upon the civilians of Gaza by Israel’s relentless onslaught.Over 51,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the ground and air assault began on 8 October 2023 after Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel the day before. Almost 2,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war resumed in March. The Gaza health ministry, which counts the dead, does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but more than half of those killed have been women and children.For many in Israel, thehorrors inflicted in the 7 October 2023 attack, when thousands of Hamas militants stormed kibbutzes, towns and cities in southern Israel and committed terrible atrocities, killing more than 1,200 people, and taking 251 hostages, including a nine-month-old baby, have left them cold to the plight of any Palestinian – particularly while hostages remain captive in Gaza.As tens of thousands of Israelis have been called up to serve, many currently have family members on the frontlines. Meanwhile, the human ordeal of Gaza is largely absent from mainstream Israeli media. To some, the Hamas attack proved that as long as Palestinians remain in Gaza, Israel will never be safe.Yet a small but growing number of voices within Israel have begun to push back, calling for an end to the war both tosave the hostagesand stop the massacre of human life in Gaza. A growing number of letters written by army and air force reservists, retired and even serving officers, have demanded the government end the war, not only in the name of Israeli lives but alsoinnocent civilians in Gaza.Veronika Cohen, 80, a Holocaust survivor who was born in the ghetto in Budapest, said she had come to protest outside Yad Vashem on the day of remembrance because: “I don’t think we can remember our suffering without acknowledging the suffering of Gaza, the deaths of tens of thousands of children, the starvation that’s going on this minute, for which we are partially responsible. It occupies the same place in my heart.”View image in fullscreenVeronika Cohen, 80, was born in the ghetto in Budapest and survived the Holocaust.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianShe acknowledged that she was in the minority in Israel when it came to speaking up about the terrible cost of the war to Palestinian life. “People here see Palestinians as the other and that’s why they have created a barrier,” she said. “They have managed not to feel their pain and I find that incomprehensible. To me, when I read the stories of their suffering in Gaza, it blends completely into how I feel about the Holocaust.”Cohen’s eyes filled with tears as she recalled seeing a recent photo of a young Palestinian boy whose arms had been blown off by Israeli missile strikes in Gaza. “The news story said that when he woke up from his operation, the first thing he did was turn to his mother, and he said: ‘how will I hug you now?’ To me, that’s a Holocaust story. And that’s why we are here: to try to awaken people to their pain in any way we can.”Ruth Vleeschhouwer Falak, 89, who survived the Nazi-occupation of the Netherlands as a child, said she was standing there because “in the 1930s, if Germans had stood up loudly against the Nazi party, maybe they wouldn’t have been able to do what they did to us. Speaking up is not a choice for me.”“The saying is never again; that means never again for anybody. That’s really what we’re standing here for,” added Ilana Drukker Tokotin, 87, who spent her childhood in hiding from the Nazis.Yet the few who have tried to bring the voice of Gaza into the anti-war protests have regularly faced fierce resistance, if not outright violence, from police. After the death of more than 500 children in Gaza in the past month alone, Standing Together, a progressive movement of Israelis and Palestinians, decided to hold an anti-war protest on Holocaust Memorial Day that was primarily dedicated to the children who had been needlessly killed by Israel in Gaza as well as the Israeli hostages still held captive.Yet after applying for permission, police told the group they were banned from holding up posters of children killed in Gaza and certain phrases such as “ethnic cleansing” were also forbidden. It was not the first time activists had faced such pushback; at other protests, police have regularly confiscated any posters bearing the faces of Gaza’s killed women and children or used force to break them up.View image in fullscreenA demonstration organised by Standing Together calls for an end to the bloodshed.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The Guardian“There was nothing new about this attempt to silence any mention of Gaza – the only difference this time was that the police foolishly put it in writing,” said Alon-Lee Green, the co-director of Standing Together. The group not only successfully challenged the ban in court but also then began taking donations to put the photos of Gaza’s child victims of the war on posters and bus stops across central Israel, with almost 200 and counting.“There has been a complete unwillingness among many here to engage with the human cost of the war in Gaza, even anger to anyone who expresses empathy for Palestinians, but I think after the government restarted the war, something is beginning to shift,” said Green. “This killing is done on the land we share and by our own hands. How can we ignore that any longer?”On Thursday night, in the same square where the hostage protests have been taking place for months, thousands gathered to hold photographs of children in Gaza aloft; chubby-cheeked babies, giggling toddlers and whole families of siblings clutching each other’s hands at they sat in their best outfits, all killed in the past 18 months.“It’s unbearable to see the faces of these children, who are no different to my children, who were killed by us,” said Noa First, 46, an artist who attended the protest, clutching a photo of baby girl D’na Khatib. “My grandparents fled the Holocaust in Germany, I’m so glad they are not alive on this remembrance day to see what Israel has become.”Israel ends mention of humanitarian zones as Gaza war grinds onRead moreHowever, there have also been visceral and hostile responses to these protests, speaking to the complexity of speaking out in the current environment. As Thursday’s demonstration took place, a far-right group gathered to shout through a megaphone: “Put down your bullshit signs. Those are the new Nazis on the other side of the border.”As around 50 people gathered in Tel Aviv to stand silently in a line holding empty saucepans to protest at Israel’s ongoing aid blockade on Gaza – which has prevented all food, water and medicines going into the Palestinian territory for more than 50 days – they were met with indifference and anger. “Traitors,” screamed one man loudly at them, while another cursed loudly at the protest. “You should all be in Gaza,” he shouted.Among those participating, holding a sign that said “starvation is a war crime” was Shira Geffen, an award-winning Israeli actor and film-maker. “In Israel, people want to ignore that we are the ones responsible for not only killing Palestinians with bombs but also hunger. But the angrier they get at our protests, and the more the police try to silence us, the louder we will scream.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaHolocaustfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Making landfall as a strong category 3, the storm, which was so vast it stretched the length of the Mississippi Gulf coast all the way into Alabama, hit the Mississippi-Louisiana coastal borderbefore continuing northward.Since then, superstorms fueled by the climate crisis have become relatively commonplace in the country, but the impact of Katrina endures to this day. Immediately following the storm, the country and world were enthralled by tragic stories out of New Orleans, where the levees failed to a catastrophic effect and the local, state and federal responses were disastrous. But Mississippi, which received themaximum impactfrom the storm surge, was largelyleft out of the national narrativearound Katrina.It tookfour weeksfor Fema and the Red Cross to arrive in the majority-Black East Biloxi neighborhood, according to then Ward 2 city councillor Bill Stallworth. Aboutone in every three peopleliving in the areas hit hardest by the storm were Black.Melody Golding, a photographer from Vicksburg, aimed to document the tragedy inMississippi, arriving in the hardest-hit part of the state shortly after the storm. Her photos captured the almost unimaginable devastation, pain and grief of survivors and resilience of the people of the Magnolia state, who came together to rebuild.View image in fullscreenMelody Golding, talking to governor Haley Barbour at the gallery, on 7 March.Photograph: Mississippi Department of Archives and HistoryHer new photo exhibit, Hurricane Katrina: Mississippi Remembers, at the two Mississippi museums in Jackson, looks back at the storm that changed the region some 20 years ago. On view through November, the free exhibit includes both Golding’s photographs and artifacts from the Mississippi department of archives and history.“[These photographers] are my personal witness to the events of this sweeping and non-discriminating catastrophe,” reads Golding’s artist statement that accompanies the exhibit.“It is an incomplete visual recording of the Mississippi coastline, all of which was very nearly wrung of life and hope after the storm. These images radically simplify what really happened. My goal in capturing them was to convey the essence of the hurricane’s destruction. The grim subject matter has a nightmarish quality, yet also a strangely elegant observance as we attempt to visualize the experience of the victims of the storm.”‘Like demons let loose in an exorcist movie’A Christmas ornament. A crystal drop from a chandelier. An Asian-style spoon. Marbles. A ceramic plate fragment. These mundane objects, assembled from the wreckage in Biloxi, where Katrina killed 53 people, show how the storm and its destruction wreaked havoc on everyday lives.Golding’s photos allow those who visit the exhibit to pause and imagine the lives of the people who left the items behind: a photograph made in Pascagoula of an Italian cookbook impaled on a fence; an image in nearby Ocean Springs of a warped vinyl record atop a pile of rubble.Throughout the exhibit, interspersed with the images and objects are quotes from Mississippi women who experienced the storm. Two years after Katrina, Golding authoredKatrina: Mississippi Women Remember, which combines her photographs with firsthand accounts of Mississippi women who survived the hurricane.View image in fullscreenA reception for the gallery on 7 March.Photograph: Mississippi Department of Archives and History“Glass windows, furniture and the entire house shook violently and made deafening sounds as if the demons were let loose in an exorcist movie,” Thaou Thi (Kim) Pham, of Ocean Springs, said about the storm.“There was a foot of water over the eaves of the roof, and the attic floor began to give way. All of us women were screaming, and the baby was crying too,” Cookie Bello, of Pearlington, said.In a November 2005 photograph, a woman in Waveland stands by her Fema trailer, near wooden posts that are the only things left of her home following the storm. A photograph in Biloxi seven months after the hurricane captures Pham standing on a slab where her home once stood. Another photo shows the Walker family, of Bay Saint Louis, sitting on an old fallen tree in their yard. A photo from Pearlington shows the Rev Samuel M Burton, who clung to the branch of a pecan tree with his dog for nine hours during the hurricane, standing in front of a wrecked home. The photographs demonstrate the extent of the loss that those who experienced the hurricane endured and the importance of their survival.‘What are we going to be walking back into?’: immense costs for Americans under hurricane threatRead moreIn addition to the destruction, Golding’s photographs also show the hopefulness and resiliency of Mississippians, and how people across the state came together to support their neighbors.Workers, from Kesker air force base servicemen who unloaded MREs in a church parking lot to people who cleared a debris-filled swamp, came together to rebuild the state and ensure that people who stayed were not abandoned.The Mississippi Gulf coast experienced a slow rebuild after the storm – even one decade later, many of the homes in East Biloxiremained unbuilt. Of the estimated 1.5 million people who evacuated Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama before Katrina,about 40% never returned. But, as Golding shows in her photography, the desire to rebuild and to remain in the state were strong following the storm.Just months after Katrina destroyed 65,000 homes in Mississippi and left more than 100,000 people homeless, one photo in Bay Saint Louis shows the remnants of a house surrounded by rubble. The owners of the home spray-painted one of the building’s outside walls with a simple message: “Will rebuild Don’t Demolish.”“When I drove to work recently, the moon was setting over the bay on my right and the sun was rising over the sound on my left,” Ann Guice, of Biloxi, said. “I saw the shimmering reflections of both on the beautiful dark waters of my coast. It is such a gorgeous place, and when we rebuild it will be paradise again.”Explore more on these topicsHurricane KatrinaHurricanesMississippiAlabamaLouisianaClimate crisisRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Zelenskyy’s claims are a reminder of the Kremlin’s increasing reliance on the North’s soldiers and ammunition and, critically, its missiles.Moscow and Pyongyang have denied reports that thousands of North Korean troops were sent to fight in Russia’s western Kursk region last autumn. Both insist there have been no weapons transfers that would violate UN sanctions.But experts have been able to form a clearer picture of the North’s material role in the conflict based on satellite imagery, verified social media videos, intercepted military reports and information released by intelligence services inUkraineand South Korea.Ukraine’s capture of North Koreans offers rare insight into Russian alliance, says ZelenskyyRead moreIn addition to large quantities of artillery shells, North Korea has supplied Russia with multiple-launch rocket systems and long-range artillery, as well as ballistic missiles that were first used against Ukrainian positions at the end of 2023.The North had supplied Russia with 148 KN-23 and KN-24 ballistic missiles by the start of this year, according to reports attributed to Ukraine’s military spy agency. The missiles are of the type believed to have been used in this week’s deadly attack on Kyiv, which also injured at least 90 people.KN-23 missiles are armed with warheads of up to one tonne, making them more powerful than the Russian equivalent missiles, a Ukrainian source told Reuters.The North Korean inventory is not confined to missiles. A joint investigation byReutersand the Open Source Centre, an independent UK-based research organisation, found that millions of its shells had found their way to the frontline by sea and then train.The investigation tracked 64 shipments, made by a special fleet of Russian munitions carriers, over 20 months. It comprised nearly 16,000 containers and millions of artillery rounds for use against Ukraine. One shipment was made as recently as 17 March, the report said.The OSCsaidits study of hundreds of satellite images and three-dimensional reconstructions of the vessels, containers and munitions “reveals a sobering truth: since September 2023, North Korea has shipped over 15,000 containers likely containing over 4 million artillery shells and rockets, potentially worth several billions of dollars”.North Korean munitions and weapons have had a significant impact on the Kremlin’s ability to prosecute the war, which began in February 2022.The investigation quoted an expert in the Ukrainian military who said the North’s contribution accounted for as much as 70% of munitions used by Russian artillery units.“North Korea’s contribution has been strategically vital,” said Hugh Griffiths, who from 2014 to 2019 was the coordinator of a UN panel of experts that monitored sanctions against North Korea. “Without Chairman Kim Jong-un’s support, PresidentVladimir Putinwouldn’t really be able to prosecute his war in Ukraine.”Other experts said the North had furnished Russia with a combination of outdated or surplus ammunition, as well as newer weapons that have now been field-tested in the war against Ukraine.In a recent report,38 North, part of the Stimson Center thinktank in Washington, listed artillery and mortar shells, multiple rocket launchers and rockets, as well as self-propelled guns among the old weapons and ammunition Pyongyang had sent to Russian forces.Tianran Xu, an expert on military technology at the Open Nuclear Network, speculated that the North had been eager to offload the hardware, which some experts say has poor levels of accuracy.Of greater significance, Xu said, was the provision of new weaponry that enhances Russia’s attack capabilities and gives the North Korean regime the ability to gauge the weapons’ performance on the battlefield.They include more than 140 Hwasong-11 series short-range ballistic missiles, parts from which were discovered after a Russian strike on Ukrainian forces in January in 2024.The 38 North report speculated that the longer the war continued, the greater the likelihood that North Korea would send more sophisticated weapons to the battlefield, including anti-tank guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles, medium-range ballistic missiles and drones jointly developed with Russia.“If the war drags on, North Korean weapon provision to Russia is most likely to escalate further,” Xu wrote on the 38 North website. “The combat performance of these hardware in Ukraine will give Pyongyang a valuable opportunity to evaluate and refine its domestic weapon systems.“In return for Pyongyang’s lethal aid, Moscow will likely reciprocate with weapons and/or military technologies, further strengthening North Korea’s offensive and defensive capabilities on the Korean peninsula and beyond.”The first North Koreandeploymentof about 11,000 soldiers came after their ruler,Kim Jong-un, andVladimir Putinagreed to a “strategic partnership treaty” during a summit in Pyongyang in June 2024.The troops were deployed to fight against the Ukrainian counter-invasion of the Russian border region of Kursk, according to South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff. About 4,000 of them have reportedly been killed or injured, and some have beentaken prisoner. The mass casualties apparently prompted their withdrawal from the frontlines in January, Ukrainian officials said; however Pyongyang appears to have sent at least 3,000 additional soldiers early this year, the South’s military said last month.Explore more on these topicsUkraineNorth KoreaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyanalysisShareReuse this content"

His funeral is expected to draw dignitaries from across the world, as well as tens of thousands of faithful. This is what is expected to happen on the day, and what may come next for the Catholic church.When and where is Pope Francis’s funeral?The funeral will be held in St Peter’s Square in Rome at 10am local time. The outdoor service, which will be led by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the dean of the college of cardinals, is expected to be attended by dignitaries from 170 foreign delegations, as well as tens of thousands of ordinary people wanting to pay their respects.About 50,000 people attended thefuneral of Francis’s immediate predecessor, Pope Benedict, which was also held in St Peter’s Square, in January 2023.In the run-up to Francis’s funeral, tens of thousands lined up to pay their respects to the pope as his body lay in state in an open wooden coffin in St Peter’s Basilica from Wednesday morning. By Friday morning, more than 130,000 people had filed past the coffin.Which foreign leaders and royals will attend?Donald Trump – the US president whose policies on immigration and mass deportations were criticised by the late pope – will be in Rome for the funeral, accompanied by his wife, Melania.Others expected to attend include the UN secretary general, António Guterres; Emmanuel Macron, the president of France; Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine; Sergio Mattarella and Giorgia Meloni, the president and prime minister of Italy, respectively; King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain; Michael D Higgins and Micheál Martin, the president and taoiseach of Ireland, respectively; and, representing the UK, Keir Starmer, the prime minister, and Prince William. Andrzej Duda, the president of Poland, will be there, as will Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and its prime minister, Luís Montenegro.Among those attending from Latin America are the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and Javier Milei – the president of Francis’s native Argentina who had previously referred to the late pontiff as a “communist”, an “imbecile” and a “lefty son of a bitch”. The Mexican president, Claudia Sheinbaum, will not attend but will be represented by the country’s interior minister, Rosa Icela Rodríguez.Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the president of the Philippines –which has one of the world’s largest Catholic populations– also will be in Rome.Russia will be represented by its culture minister, Olga Lyubimova. The country’s president, Vladimir Putin, has not travelled to a western country since ordering the invasion of Ukraine three years ago and issubject to an international criminal court arrest warrantfor the alleged forced deportation of Ukrainian children.Among the opposition party leaders attending are Alberto Núñez Feijóo of Spain’s conservative People’s party, and Jordan Bardella, the president of France’s far-right National Rally party. Despite his party’s anti-immigration stance, Bardella recently praised the late pope’s “constant attention to the forgotten and the dignity of the most vulnerable”.What security measures are in place?Barriers have already been installed inside and outside St Peter’s Basilica to control the crowds, security checks have been increased and staff have been distributing bottles of water due to the warm weather.State-of-the-art defence and security mechanisms have been deployed across Rome and in the skies above the capital, including anti-drone weaponry, a no-fly zone patrolled by fighter jets, and sophisticated jamming technologies. Anti-terrorism and anti-sabotage units are also already on the ground.The basilica and the surrounding area are being patrolled by more than 2,000 police officers between now and the end of the conclave that is expected to take place early next month in order to choose Francis’s successor. They will be supported by 400 traffic police officers who will help manage the movement of the diplomatic convoys.Will the funeral and burial be like those of his predecessors?No – quite deliberately not. Francis chose to break with the traditions surrounding papal funerals in April last year when he approved a set of simplified rules that allow a pope to be “laid out and buried like any son or daughter of the church”, without the use of an elevated bier topped with cushions. Or, as Francis himself put it: “With dignity, but not on cushions. In my opinion, the ritual was too ornate.”Papal funerals have traditionally involved three coffins, with the body of the pope placed in a coffin of cypress wood, which is then placed inside one of lead, which, in turn, is put inside a coffin of oak. Francis, however, stipulated that he wanted his body to be placed in a single, simple coffin made of wood and lined with zinc.Where will Pope Francis be buriedFrancis’s choice of burial place marks another break with tradition. Most popes have decided to be laid to rest in the grottoes beneath St Peter’s. But Francis opted instead for the Santa Maria Maggiore Basilica in Rome’s Esquilino neighbourhood, which lies outside the Vatican.The Marian shrine, which houses a celebrated icon of the Virgin Mary and a relic of the manger in which baby Jesus was laid, was a favourite spot of Francis’s, and he often prayed there before and after his trips abroad.“As I’ve always promised the Virgin, the place is already prepared,”he said in an interview with Mexican TVtwo years ago. “I want to be buried in Santa Maria Maggiore because it’s my great devotion.”Francis requested that he be buried “in the ground, without particular decoration” but with the inscription of his papal name in Latin: Franciscus.Once the funeral mass has finished, Francis’s coffin will be taken, in procession, to Santa Maria Maggiore. The Vatican announced that people will be able to visit Francis’s tomb in the basilica from Sunday morning.MapWhat happens next?The funeral will mark the beginning of theNovemdiales– the nine days of mourning and masses offered for the repose of Francis’s soul. Attention will then turn to the business of choosing his successor.Theconclave held to appoint a new popeusually begins between 15 and 20 days after the previous pontiff’s death. Once assembled in the Sistine Chapel, 135 cardinal electors – cardinals under the age of 80 – will swear an oath of absolute secrecy and begin their deliberations.After each round of secret voting, the ballot cards are burned and chemicals added to tint the smoke black or white. Black smoke emerging from the 60ft chimney lets those gathered outside know that the ballot has proved inconclusive. White smoke means the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics have a new pope.Who are the frontrunners to be the next pope?As the recent film Conclave showed, predicting the next pope is not a straightforward matter.Francis – the first Jesuit pope – was a surprise choice; a factthe Argentinian immediately acknowledged when he joked that his fellow cardinals had had to “go to the end of the earth”to find a new bishop of Rome.Butamong the names frequently mentioned as possible successorsare Matteo Zuppi, a progressive Italian cardinal; Pietro Parolin, who serves as the Vatican’s secretary of state; and Luis Antonio Tagle, from the Philippines.Explore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanThe papacyCatholicismChristianityReligionItalyexplainersShareReuse this content"

He hates the tram. So much so, he refuses to take it to work, preferring a half-hour walk to his office instead. He says the the buses are even worse. He avoids them completely.The reason, he says, is antisocial behaviour. He’s become increasingly bothered by people playing music out loud or vaping on public transport.“You get on the trains or trams, especially on a Friday or Saturday night, and there are people with the speakers and music and it’s just impolite … It just aggravates me,” said Kenyon, who works in trading. “I go to Dubai quite a lot and everything’s all nice. But here, it’s like there’s no rules any more. It’s not that I’m the fun police. I just find it annoying.”Music to his ears, however, was the news that the Liberal Democrats are proposing toban playing musicand TV shows out loud on public transport.Under the plansannounced on Wednesday, people booming out their favourite tunes or shows from their phone on public transport, or while at stations or bus stops, could face a maximum fine of £1,000.Reena, 41, a journalist sitting on a tram heading out of the centre towards the city’s media hub, shared Kenyon’s disdain for loudspeakers.“I hate it. I think it’s really unsociable,” she said. “I have less tolerance for it now that I’ve got kids … I do understand when you’re young and you want to listen to music together, but I just don’t think it should be when there’s lots of other people, especially if I’m with my kids and they’re having a nap or something. It’s unnecessarily loud.”For Sarah Hastings, a music teacher in her 50s, it was not playing music out loud that was the problem but the lyrics.“If it’s just background music, mood music, whatever, that’s not going to offend anybody. It’s not the music. It’s the words. Sometimes there are young kids around and it’s loud and it’s language that they could do without hearing,” she said.To implement the ban, theLiberal Democratsare proposing amendments to the bus services bill, which is going through parliament. As transport policy is devolved, the move would only apply to England.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On the occasion he does hear music on a tram or a bus, it doesn’t bother him.“Sometimes I like music. If it’s a song I like, I vibe with it,” he said. “I think they [the Liberal Democrats] should have other things to focus on. Music on buses and trams. It’s really a non-issue.”He was not the only one who felt at odds with the proposal. Kayes Syed, 48, a lawyer, said: “I don’t have a problem with it. It’s not rude. It’s quite nice, actually. I’m a bit grumpy in the morning, so things like that just cheer me up. I’d rather them [the Liberal Democrats] focus on homelessness, drug abuse or crime rather than playing music.”Explore more on these topicsTransportTransport policyLiberal DemocratsManchesterGreater ManchesterEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a series of singular events: the docking of the Windrush in 1948, unrest in Notting Hill or Brixton, the murder of Stephen Lawrence. All important, but all firmly focused on the capital.Now Lanre has written a book about the Thatcher years, looking at the stories that are less often told: those that took place outside London, in Liverpool – with the oldest Black community in the UK – or in his home town of Bradford.There he learned about George Lindo, a Black man framed by corrupt police officers in the 1970s. When he was jailed, Bradford’s Black community rallied round and their dedicated action led to him being released and given compensation, which was incredibly rare at the time.In Manchester, he finds a secret history of house music, and a groundbreaking nightclub that defied a colour bar in the city. In Birmingham he looks at the harassment of Rastafarians by police, and an excoriating TV show about the BBC by the sociologist Stuart Hall.It’s all part of a rich history that deserves to be heard, he tellsHelen Pidd.“These historic communities that have been established have had a huge impact on the country. They’ve reshaped the country, culturally, politically and socially.”Illustration: Joe Plimmer/Guardian Pictures/BBC, John Deakin/Getty, John Akomfrah, David Levene, Chris Steele-Perkins/Magnum Photos,  Don McPhee,  Hulton Deutsch, Evening Standard, Trinity Mirror,  Gary WeaserExplore more on these topicsBlack British cultureToday in FocusHistory booksRaceEngland"

Since Tuesday, the conditions have triggered potent showers and thunderstorms, and yellow and orange weather warnings have been issued.With winds generally remaining light this week, the greatest concerns surround the risks from intense rainfall, as slow-moving heavy showers can deliver a prolonged downpour to a fairly localised area. The authorities have warned people to avoid high-risk areas such as roads with steep embankments amid a threat of flash flooding and mudslides.Residents have been advised not to use basements in the event of rainfall and to report any drain blockages in urban areas. Meanwhile, northern regions are on highest alert for flooding after heavy rainfall increased soil saturation and heightened water levels.The most severe storms have been towards the Adriatic. During torrential showers in the Marche region on Wednesday, several locations recorded 10-20mm of rainfall within half an hour, while farther south, in Abruzzo and Molise, there were reports of hail the size of chickpeas.Although the weekend is expected to bring some respite, thunderstorms are likely to return early next week before drier and calmer conditions at the start of May.InKenya, heavy rain in Nairobi on Monday and Tuesday led to at least seven deaths in flash flooding. Authorities said the total could rise as more victims may be discovered downstream.At least 60,000 people have been affected by the floods, with more than 500 forced from their homes, many within Nairobi’s Mukuru slum region.Farther west, in Narok County, two people died after being swept away while attempting to cross a swollen river, and eight cows were killed when the tree they were sheltering under was struck by lightning.Kenya’s primary rainy season, known as masika, occurs in mid-March to late May and is characterised by periods of prolonged steady rainfall interspersed with heavier downpours.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The award-winning project, co-founded by the Palestinian playwright and director Amir Nizar Zuabi, reached 2 million people in 17 countries asshe travelled from Turkey to the UK.The Herds’ journey began in Kinshasa’s Botanical Gardens on 10 April, kicking off four days of events. It moved on to Lagos,Nigeria, the following week, where up to 5,000 people attended events performed by more than 60 puppeteers.On Friday the streets of Dakar inSenegalwill be filled with more than 40 puppet zebras, wildebeest, monkeys, giraffes and baboons as they run through Médina, one of the busiest neighbourhoods, where they will encounter a creation by Fabrice Monteiro, a Belgium-born artist who lives in Senegal, and is known for his large-scale sculptures. On Saturday the puppets will be part of an event in the fishing village of Ngor.View image in fullscreenThe Herds’ 20,000km journey began in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Photograph: Berclaire/walk productionsThe first set of animal puppets was created by UkwandaPuppetryand Designs Art Collective in Cape Town using recycled materials, but in each location local volunteers are taught how to make their own animals using prototypes provided by Ukwanda. The project has already attracted huge interest from people keen to get involved. In Dakar more than 300 artists applied for 80 roles as artists and puppet guides. About 2,000 people will be trained to make the puppets over the duration of the project.“The idea is that we’re migrating with an ever-evolving, growing group of animals,” Zuabitold the Guardian last year.Zuabi has spoken of The Herds as a continuation of Little Amal’s journey, which was inspired by refugees, who often cite climate disaster as a trigger for forced migration. The Herds will put the environmental emergency centre stage, and will encourage communities to launch their own events to discuss the significance of the project and get involved in climate activism.View image in fullscreenThe puppets are created with recycled materials and local volunteers are taught how to make them in each location.Photograph: Ant StrackKeep your head above water: art show looks at the rising seasRead more“The idea is to put in front of people that there is an emergency – not with scientific facts, but with emotions,” said The Herds’ Senegal producer, Sarah Desbois.She expects thousands of people to view the four events being staged over the weekend. “We don’t have a tradition of puppetry in Senegal.

In return, he offered political support for the appointment of executives at BR Distribuidora when it was still state-owned.Collor, who led the country from 1990 to 1992, was sentenced to eight years and 10 months, to be served initially in prison, rather than under house arrest. He was arrested on Friday in the northeastern state of Alagoas.Under the Brazilian legal system, cases concerning members of Congress, presidents and ministers go directly to the supreme court. He was not yet in prison because his lawyers were still lodging appeals.The case stemmed from the Operation Car Wash,a sweeping corruption investigationthat has implicated top politicians and businesspeople across Latin America – including the current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was arrested in 2018 and imprisoned for nearly two years.Collor, 75, was the first Brazilian president elected by popular vote, in 1989, after a 21-year military dictatorship. He was impeached and removed from office by Congress in 1992 following corruption allegations. In 2007, he was elected as a senator representing his home state of Alagoas in northeastern Brazil.Supreme court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered the former president’s arrest Thursday, with the full board set to vote on Friday whether to confirm the decision. De Moraes said in his decision that Collor should begin serving his sentence, noting that the former president’s lawyers have attempted to drag out proceedings through appeals.The justice also said that the court had previously ruled in similar cases that, once appeals have no merit, the sentence can be served right away.Collor’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes afterDonald Trumpearlier this week signed a series of executive orders focused on universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda.One order called for harder enforcement of Section 117, a federal law requiring colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.US restoring legal status of hundreds of students after abruptly revoking visasRead moreThe Department of Education’s office of general counsel will investigate “UC Berkeley’s apparent failure to fully and accurately disclose significant funding received from foreign sources,” education secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.UC Berkeley denied the government’s claims, saying that for the last two years “UC Berkeley has been cooperating with federal inquiries regarding 117 reporting issues, and will continue to do so.”The department cited media reports from 2023 about UC Berkeley failing to disclose “hundreds of millions of dollars in funding from a foreign government” but didn’t mention the country.On May 2023, the Daily Beast reported that UC Berkeley failed to report it got $220m from the Chinese government to build a joint Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI), which UC Berkeley and Tsinghua University opened in 2014 in the city of Shenzhen to focus on “strategic emerging industries”, according to the institute’s website.Last year, a report by the Republican members of the House select committee on the Chinese Communist party found that US tax dollars have contributed to China’s technological advancement and military modernization when American researchers worked with their Chinese peers in areas such as hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, nuclear technology and semiconductor technology.In response to the report, UC Berkeley said Berkeley’s researchers “engage only in research whose results are always openly disseminated around the world” and the school was “not aware of any research by Berkeley faculty at TBSI conducted for any other purpose”. The university also said then it would unwind its partnership.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It promised to increase low and middle incomes, develop the service industry and boost consumption.“We should take multiple measures to help enterprises in difficulties,” it said. “We should strengthen financing support. We should accelerate the integration of domestic and foreign trade.”It stressed the need for more proactive macroeconomic policies, faster development of a new real estate model and increased housing stock, and “stepping up” city renewal programmes and urban renovation.Wen-ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub, said the politburo’s decisions showed Beijing “clearly views the international macroeconomic environment as hostile” and was willing to take on high domestic inflation to weather the tariffs.“[This] hints that China will be digging into the trenches and is preparing for a long trade fight with Trump,” he said.Sung said Beijing was “doubling down on boosting domestic demand” and bolstering fiscal stimulus as the international market showed no signs of significant improvement.The meeting was held amid reports that Chinese authorities were considering a list of US products to exempt from the 125% tariffs imposed on all US imports. Earlier reports from Bloomberg and Reuters said medical equipment, semiconductors and some industrial chemicals such as ethane were being considered.On Thursday, a Shenzhen-based supplier posted online that it had been notified by the customs agency that eight semiconductor products would no longer attract the 125% duty.On Friday, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Michael Hart, said the Chinese authorities had been asking members what products they imported from the US that they could not find anywhere else.He welcomed the early signs that both sides were reviewing tariffs and starting to produce lists of excluded items. Stock markets across theAsia Pacificregion rose after the reports.The trade war has hit the US and Chinese economies, and the tariff exemptions are likely to be a sign of the parties trying to ease their way out. The US had already exempted some categories of Chinese-made products from tariffs, including smartphones and laptops. This week,Trump said his tariffs on Chinawould “come down substantially but it won’t be zero”.But in public the two governments have given different accounts on the status of negotiations on ending the trade war.0:33Trump claims he is in talks with Beijing over tariffs despite denial from China – videoOn Friday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry reiterated its claim that the US and China were not engaged in any negotiations on tariffs, contradictingTrump’s claims on Thursday.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said the two sides were talking. “We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we’ve been meeting with China,” he said, declining to say who “they” were.The remarks appeared to be in response to the Chinese commerce ministry’s spokesperson, He Yadong, earlier saying there were “currently no economic and trade negotiations between China and the United States”.Explore more on these topicsChinaChinese economyXi JinpingTrump tariffsInternational tradeTariffsGlobal economynewsShareReuse this content"

The pair searched for her with the help of locals but to no avail.Then, in March, reports began coming in that Valerie had been spotted. One picture appeared to show the dog’s oversized ears poking above some paddock stubble.KangalaWildlifeRescue volunteers used surveillance, traps and lures to try to find Valerie. They captured a video of her, but she remained at large.Stokes Bay locals like to pointout their island is six times bigger than Singapore. It’s also much wilder – a place where a couple can walk alone on a pristine beach, whales visit, trees grow bent over from the wind, andbushfires occasionally raze the land.

Then Curtis noticed nearly US$600 had been taken from her PayPal account.Grumpy Cat, also known as Tardar Sauce, shot to internet fame in 2012 due to her permanently grumpy facial expressions that were caused by a permanent underbite and feline dwarfism.Australians pay $84 a month for their internet. Why so expensive, and what can be done to lower the cost?Read moreThe American domestic cat became a symbol for everyone on the internet who felt disgruntled about life, with millions of followers on social media, memes, merchandise including clothing and soft toys, and even a fragrance.At the peak of the cat’s fame in 2014, the film Grumpy Cat’s Worst Christmas Ever was released. It starred the grumpy cat herself, voiced by Aubrey Plaza. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an aggregate score of 27%.The world of internet stardom moves on quickly, however, and Grumpy Cat’s fame has dimmed since Tardar Saucedied in 2019, aged 7.But the ghost of the frowny feline still haunts anyone trying to sell a product that could be confused with the real Grumpy Cat. The owner of the Grumpy Cat trademark is ever vigilant for unauthorised products sold online.Last year, Grumpy Cat Ltd filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against more than 200 online sellers in a US court. They sought damages for products sold on sites such as RedBubble that allegedly infringed on the trademark.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterView image in fullscreenAlda Curtis, 63, received a default judgment against her for a T-shirt sold on RedBubble.Photograph: SuppliedIn September last year, the court ruled a default judgment in favour of Grumpy Cat Ltd. The company was awarded damages of US$100,000 per defendant.If the payments were made in full, the company would win more than US$24m.The sellers have also been restrained from continuing to sell the products identified, forcing the removal from the online stores.Curtis set up a Redbubble store as a hobby while studying counselling in the northern suburbs of Sydney, Australia. She first became aware of the Grumpy Cat Ltd case against her two weeks after the default judgment in Ohio.The problem for Curtis was one item she sold: a T-shirt of a frowning purple and yellow cat. She said the sale had been made just before the US lawsuit was launched against her. The T-shirt had sat unsold for years on her site.The design for the T-shirt had been licensed from a design website, titled “Grumpy Cat Pattern Graphic T-shirt”. Curtis earned just over US$1 from the sale. In the six years she had been running her store, she had generated about US$200 in revenue.Curtis said she had “absolutely no intentions” of infringing the trademark. “I’ve seen a picture of that cat, but I didn’t even cross my mind that was in any copyright infringement or anything like that,” she said.“So it was totally just a fluke, and they’re taking advantage of that. If everyone in the world is going to be not allowed to call [a design] Happy Cat, Grumpy Cat, feathered cat, or whatever it might be … where does it end?”In February, a few months after the ruling, Curtis discovered US$592.75 was missing from her PayPal account, without explanation. After multiple attempts to contact PayPal to try to get the money back, Curtis said PayPal referred her to Grumpy Cat’s lawyers.Others across the globe have found themselves in similar situations. There are posts on Reddit asking what to do after finding a default judgment has been made against them.“I had no idea ‘Grumpy Cat’ was a thing. ‘Grumpy Cat’ was not even mentioned on my design neither looked my design like their stupid cat,” one poster said.Prof Graeme Austin, chair in private law at Victoria University in New Zealand, said US trademark law gives courts powers to impose tough damages awards in infringement cases, including statutory damages of up to US$200,000.“Wholesale default judgment proceedings in trademark and copyright cases are a familiar strategy for intellectual property owners,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You want to be in the position to raise any defences as early as possible.”Curtis said it could be a case of what has been termed “SAD Scheme”. In a 2023 Columbia Law Review Forum article, Prof Eric Goldman described the“Schedule A Defendants Scheme”in the northern district of Illinois – where the Grumpy Cat case was filed – targeting online merchants in China, mostly.Goldman said the scheme allowed rights owners “to extract settlements from online merchants without satisfying basic procedural safeguards like serving the complaint and establishing personal jurisdiction over defendants”.Goldberg argued the scheme “goes far beyond just curbing online infringement and instead causes substantial harm to innocent merchants”.Looking for the last human place on the internet?

The company also argued that the trademark infringement was due to the name of the product being “Grumpy Cat Pattern Graphic T-Shirt”.Curtis said a search of her inbox shows no email from the lawyers until the first one she received in September.A ruling has yet to be made.Lawyers for Grumpy Cat offered to settle the case for US$1,000 in an email to Curtis in March, seen by Guardian Australia. Users on Reddit have reported similar offers.In 2018, Grumpy Cat Ltdwon $750,000 in damagesfrom a US coffee company for violating the terms of their agreement to use the cat’s image on a line of iced coffee drinks called “Grumppuccinos”. Grumpy Cat’s owners said the company had “blatantly infringed” their copyrights and trademarks when they began selling roasted coffee and Grumppucino T-shirts featuring Tardar Sauce’s face.As of 2024, itwas reportedthat Grumpy Cat Ltd had filed more than 50 lawsuits related to the use of Grumpy Cat in unauthorised merchandise.Grumpy Cat’s lawyers and PayPal were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsInternetBusinessIntellectual propertynewsShareReuse this content"

His death was not being treated as suspicious.Police sources on Friday morning confirmed that the deceased man was Adrian Torrens, who was charged on Monday with Griffin’s murder, as well as 11 unrelated domestic violence matters.Griffin, a keen athlete, was found dead in March, her body partly submerged in Erina Creek near a Central Coast highway, after she disappeared on her way home from a night out with friends.Forensic and postmortem examinations of Griffin’s death did not initially point to suspicious circumstances, but Supt Darryl Jobson said on Tuesday that it was an “unsettling” case and “a matter which has not sat well with us from the start”.An investigation led to the arrest last week of Torrens. Police alleged he was not known to Griffin but the pair had become involved in a physical altercation after 3am on 23 March.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterAfter finding Torrens unresponsive in his cell on Thursday night, corrective services personnel and ambulance paramedics tried to revive him but were unsuccessful, police said.Auburn police area command officers established a crime scene and began an investigation. A report will be prepared for the coroner.The NSW premier, Chris Minns, said on Friday that it was concerning Torrens had been free to allegedly murder Griffin despite a history of family violence offending.Torrens was released on a community corrections order (CCO) in January by the chief magistrate of the local court, Michael Allen.He faced charges relating to the alleged breaching of that order and the alleged murder of Griffins at the time of his death.The fact Torrens was on a CCO was first reported by theSydney Morning Herald.Minns said it was a “very important question” to answer why Torrens was not in custody at the time Griffins was killed.“I’m obviously aware of those reports, and they are concerning, but as soon as we have answers, we’ll report them to the family,” he said.“It may well be part of the coronial inquiry as to the death in custody, and we’ll do everything we possibly can to give answers to Audrey’s family in the days and weeks ahead.”Minns said the government was committed to uncovering whatever it could to understand the circumstances behind Griffin’s murder.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We need to remove the discretion from police – our community expects that police thoroughly investigate these crimes against women unfortunately police are not meeting that expectation.Explore more on these topicsCentral CoastNew South WalesViolence against women and girlsCrime - AustraliaDeaths in custodyPrisonsnewsShareReuse this content"

He was the son of Juliane Gallina, who was appointed thedeputy director for digital innovation at the Central Intelligence Agencyin February 2024.The story of how the son of a top-ranking US spy died fighting for Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion ofUkraineis an unlikely tale of how homegrown anger at the United States and online radicalisation led from a middle-class Virginia childhood to the killing fields of eastern Ukraine.On a VKontakte page attributed to Gloss, a high school football player born to parents who both served in the military, he described himself as “a supporter of the multipolar world. I ran away from home. traveled the world. I hate fascism. I love my homeland.” He also posted the flags ofRussiaand Palestine.According to the investigative website iStories,Gloss is one of more than 1,500 foreigners who have signed contracts with the Russian military since February 2022. The database for the enrollment office was later leaked, exposing him as having signed the contract in September 2023. Sources told iStories that Gloss had been deployed with “assault units”, those engaged in harsh frontline fighting, in December 2023. An acquaintance said that he had been deployed to a Russian airborne regiment sent to storm Ukrainian positions near the city of Soledar.“With his noble heart and warrior spirit Michael was forging his own hero’s journey when he was tragically killed in EasternEuropeon April 4, 2024,” his family wrote in the obituary, which did not mention Russia and Ukraine or discuss the circumstances of his death.In university, Gloss was active in gender equality and environmental protest circles. He joined Rainbow Family, a leftwing environmental protest group, and in 2023 traveled to Hatay, Turkey, to assist in the recovery followingthe earthquake that killed more than 56,000 people. He had also become increasingly angry at the US for its support of Israel and the war in Gaza.While in Turkey, Gloss began expressing a desire to go on to Russia. “He was usually watching videos about Palestine and was so angry at America,” one acquaintance told iStories. “He started thinking about going to Russia. He wanted to war with the USA. But I think he was very influenced by the conspiracy theory videos.”The Determined Spy: Frank Wisner, the CIA and a covert career cut shortRead moreAfter receiving a visa to Russia, he traveled around the country before arriving in Moscow, where he joined the military shortly before his documents expired. Photographs and videos obtained by iStories showed he was sent to a Russian training camp, where he mostly trained alongsideNepali contract soldiers. Three months after enlisting, an acquaintance said, he was deployed to Ukraine as a member of an assault battalion.A number of acquaintances told the outlet that he had not been interested in fighting, but hoped the army would allow him to receive a Russian passport and stay in the country.The circumstance’s of Gloss’s death are not known. A friend said that his family had been informed by the Russian government of his death but were given little other information. “It was announced that he died within the borders of Ukraine,” the friend wrote. “We do not know whether he participated in the war. They did not provide any other detailed information.”It was not clear whether the Russians performed a background check on Gloss or knew the identity of his mother.

And with that statement, the US president made clear that he wanted to carve up another country, Ukraine, and so legitimise the forcible seizure of land made by Moscow 11 years ago.From reading the transcript of the interview, Trump’s thinking is hardly coherent. Crimea, he says, wouldn’t have been seized if he had been president in 2014, but “it was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama” and now Crimea has “been with them [Russia] for a long time” – so it is time to accept the seizure.Trump envoy meets Putin hours after Moscow killing of Russian generalRead moreThe president does not even pursue the argument that a recognition of Russia’s occupation of Crimea is a necessary price of ending Russian military assault onUkraine, though perhaps he thinks it – and instead the conversation is moved on by the reporters to discussing Trump’s aspirations for annexing Greenland and Canada. “The only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state,” he added.Wars seldom end satisfactorily. The struggle, violence and sacrifice often does not bear the promised fruit. Invaded suddenly by Russia, Ukraine fought off the capture of Kyiv and existential collapse in the spring, summer and autumn of 2022 but has been unable to expel the attackers since, leaving Kyiv facing the reality of Russia occupying about 18% of its territory.But the proposed US settlement term sheet –now in the public domainand verified by Trump’s comments about Crimea – is redolent of great power thinking at the end of previous wars: the carve-ups of Versailles in 1919, where a country that had only been narrowly defeated was treated as if it were conquered, or Potsdam in 1945, which divided Europe into west and east.Ukraine’s own peace plan –an older version of which was also leaked on Friday– tries a different tack: a full ceasefire on the current frontlines first, then a discussion about territories later. It is not the conversation that the US or Russia want to have, but Kyiv argues, with European support, that peace should be rooted in international law, not capitulation. Agreements unjustly imposed do not endure.The difficulty for Kyiv is, first, that it is the US proposing to give “de jure recognition of Russian control of Crimea” – so, a direct agreement with Russia. The second is that if Ukraine were determined to fight on, and hope that Trump would walk away, it risks losing military intelligence again – and the US may not sell Kyiv critical weapons such as Patriot air defence missiles.Russia, meanwhile, is responding with a series of increasingly aggressive punishment bombings aimed at Ukrainian civilians.Nineteen were killed when a children’s playground in Kryvyi Rih was bombedon 4 April;35 died in a morning missile attack on Palm Sunday, 13 April, in central Sumyas families promenaded into town. Three more died overnight in Pavlohrad when a drone hit an apartment block.This suggests a growing confidence that Russia will not be punished for starting a war, while Trump makes simple demands on social media for the war to stop. On Thursday,the US president said “Vladimir, STOP!”after 12 were killed by Russian bombing in Kyiv, and he complained that “5,000 soldiers a week are dying” – an exaggeration and more importantly a false equivalence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, Kyiv acknowledged the deaths of 46,000 of its own troops in mid-February, so together the total military fatality rate is less than 2,000 a week.For all the Russian aggression and the casualties it has caused, the proposed US peace terms say that while Ukraine should be compensated somehow, all sanctions on Russia going back to 2014 should be removed and Washington and Moscow should engage in “economic cooperation on energy and other industrial sectors”. So not just a carve-up, but a rapprochement that Ukraine cannot prevent.Peace discussions do more than end wars. They often set diplomatic standards for the period thereafter. Perhaps there will be last-minute changes, but the warmer tone of the US-Russia discussions compared withTrump’s beratings of Zelenskyydoes not engender much hope. Ukraine’s options – fight on and risk losing the US, or accept a formal loss of Crimea – are not attractive, even if the latter may pave the way to a ceasefire.Explore more on these topicsUkraineCrimeaRussiaUS foreign policyDonald TrumpEuropeTrump administrationanalysisShareReuse this content"

Meetings are taking place right now,” Trump told reporters on Thursday. “I think we’re going to make a deal … I think we’re getting very close.”But no apparent breakthrough was reached on Friday. Putin’s senior aide Yuri Ushakov, who was present at the talks, said the discussions were “constructive and quite useful” and noted that the two sides had “narrowed differences”.In comments to journalists, Ushakov said the possibility of resuming direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine had also been discussed.Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Witkoff had left Moscow carrying a message for Trump. There was no immediate comment from Witkoff on the outcome of the meeting.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff and Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Friday.Photograph: Kristina Kormilitsyna/APAt the start of the talks, the Kremlin published a short clip showing Putin and Witkoff – who holds no formal diplomatic credentials – shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries in the Kremlin before sitting down on opposite sides of a white oval table to start their meeting behind closed doors.Putin was flanked in the meeting by Ushakov and his investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev. Three hours later, Witkoff’s car was seen leaving the Kremlin.Although Trump has repeatedly claimed he was close to ending the war, now in its fourth year, his efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine have so far yielded little results, stalled by Moscow’s hardline demands.Reuters on Friday published two sets of documents outlining the US and Ukrainian proposals for ending the war, revealing significant differences on issues ranging from territorial concessions to sanctions.It remains unclear whether Moscow, which has consistently rejected an immediate ceasefire, would agree to the US proposal, despite the major concessions it offers the Kremlin, including allowing it to retain territory it has captured.Trump admitted on Friday that the talks were “very fragile” and said he had no deadline for achieving peace, having previously claimed he could end the war “in 24 hours”.In an interview withTime magazine published on Friday, Trump also said that “Crimea will stay with Russia”, the latest example of the US leader putting pressure on Ukraine to make concessions to end the war while it remains under siege.View image in fullscreenThe scene of the car bombing that killed Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, a senior Russian military officer, in Balashikha.Photograph: Yulia Morozova/ReutersUkraine’s leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, later insisted the territory is “the property of the Ukrainian people”.“Our position is unchanged,” he told reporters in Kyiv. “The constitution of Ukraine says that all the temporarily occupied territories … belong to Ukraine.”Witkoff’s visit came hours after a senior Russian general was blown up outside his apartment in what appears to have been the latest Ukrainian operation deep inside Russian territory.The Russian authorities named the officer as Lt Gen Yaroslav Moskalik, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the general staff of the Russian armed forces. The blast was similar in nature to previous attacks on Russians that were later claimed by Ukraine.The apparent Ukrainian assassination is unlikely to sit well with theTrump administration, which has been desperate to show tangible progress on peace before Trump’s 100th day in office next week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The committee, which investigates major crimes, said it had opened a criminal case.Baza, a Telegram channel with sources in Russia’s law enforcement agencies, said a bomb in a parked car in the town of Balashikha, in the Moscow region, was detonated remotely when the officer, who lived locally, walked past.MapA video circulating on Russian social media captured the moment the car exploded, while additional images showed the burnt-out vehicle.The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for the killing, with Peskov saying Kyiv was engaging in “terrorist activities on Russian territory”. Ukraine has not yet commented on the incident.Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine has targeted dozens of Russian military officers and Russian-installed officials whom Kyiv has accused of committing war crimes in the country. Little is known, however, about the clandestine Ukrainian resistance cells involved in assassinations and attacks on military infrastructure in Russia and Russian-controlled areas.Last December, Ukraine’s security services targeted another senior Russian general, Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, who was killed after an explosive device hidden in an electric scooterdetonated outside an apartment buildingin Moscow.At the time, Keith Kellogg, Trump’s appointed special representative for Ukraine and Russia, criticised the killing, saying it could have violated the rules of warfare.Apart from military figures, Ukraine hastargetedprominent Russian pro-war propagandists including Darya Dugina, the daughter of an ultra-nationalist Russian ideologue, who waskilled in 2022when a bomb blew up the Toyota Land Cruiser she was driving.Moskalik, 59, was part of several high-profile Russian foreign delegations in recent years, including in at least two rounds of talks with Ukrainian and western officials, in 2015 and 2019, as well as a 2018 visit to the Assad regime in Syria. Insiders close to the defence ministry say his influence within the Russian military was on the rise.Mikhail Zvinchuk, a popular Russian military blogger with ties to the defence establishment, said: “According to chatter behind the scenes, one scenario for personnel reshuffling at the general staff had Moskalik being considered as a potential head of the national defence management centre, primarily due to his methodical approach and thoughtfulness.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineUS foreign policyTrump administrationEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Fatal police shootings are relatively rare in Germany and prosecutors were quoted in local media as saying the suspension and investigation were “routine”.Police have not identified the victim due to data protection laws but media and pressure groups have identified him as Lorenz A.Police said in a statement that the man, a German citizen, aimed pepper spray at security staff outside the club after they refused him entry, hurting four people, and that he threatened others with a knife while running away.When a patrol car tracked him down, police said he again used the pepper spray and approached the 27-year-old officer in a threatening manner. The police officer then opened fire.A coroner’s report found that at least three bullets hit the man from behind: in the back of his head, torso and hip, local prosecutors said. A fourth shot is believed to have grazed his upper thigh. He later died in hospital.The state interior minister, Daniela Behrens, said the autopsy results raised “serious questions and grave suspicions” that must be “unsparingly addressed and resolved”.Police representatives warned against any rush to judgment. “There are racism accusations because the deceased was a person of colour,” Kevin Komolka, the state chair of the GdP police union, told the public broadcaster NDR. “There’s a mood developing painting police as trigger-happy hooligans.”Prosecutors have begun evaluating security camera footage and audio recordings from the scene and said there was no indication that Lorenz A had threatened police with the knife he had with him. The officers’ body cameras were reportedly turned off.Rights groups, which have organised a rally in Oldenburg on Friday, said the shooting raised serious concerns.The German chapter of Amnesty International said the killing “impacts an entire community and all those people in Germany affected by racism”. It said any investigation into the incident led by police would be biased. “We finally need independent investigation mechanisms that are not controlled by police or interior affairs authorities,” it said, citing “structural racism”.The Black People in Germany Initiative (ISD) quoted friends and the family of Lorenz, calling him a keen basketball player and a “fun-loving person who was full of energy”.“Now he’s dead, killed by an institution that is supposed to protect us,” it said in a statement, joining the call for an independent investigation as well as a national complaints office for allegations of police racism.The ‪Amadeu Antonio Foundation, which campaigns against extremism and racism in German society, also denounced what it said was not an isolated incident and questioned the police account that the officer had grounds to fear for his life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Archaeologists believe the vessel may have sunk during a storm in the 15th or 16th centuries.Photograph: from Arqueòlegs.catThe structure was held together by a mix of wooden and iron nails. The construction is typical of the medieval boats that were found in the Mediterranean and throughoutEuropefrom the middle of the 15th century.“We’d thought some archaeological boat remains might turn up on this site, which is near the port and the artificial stone quay that protected the port, and which was a working zone in the 15th and 16th centuries,” said the lead archaeologist, Santi Palacios. “Two years later, we’ve been lucky enough to find a boat.”The surviving wood of the boat – which has been named the Ciutadella I after the nearby Ciutadella park – is very fragile and has been kept damp and covered with the sand in which it lay for centuries to help prevent further deterioration.“The wood has to be kept constantly damp so as to keep it in a good state,” said Delia Eguiluz, a restorer. “When we move it, we’ll have to dismantle it piece-by-piece so we can continue our research.”The team is mapping the site, labelling all the pieces and taking samples from the boat. In the next phase, the wreck will be taken to a special facility where it will be treated with water-soluble wax to reinforce and preserve the structure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Modi is trying to assuage national anger, which has been intense.”The attackers reportedly made their victims reveal their religion by reciting the Kalma, the Islamic declaration of faith. Those who could not do so were shot dead.Pakistan and India exchange fire as UN calls for ‘maximum restraint’Read moreThe brazen assault in a tranquil meadow in Pahalgam, where families were picnicking, shattered Kashmir’s relative calm and struck at the heart of its tourist revival.In 2019, Modi’s Hindu-nationalist government revoked Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status and split the territory into two federally ruled zones. The government also allowed non-locals to buy land.An ensuing security clampdown reduced terrorist activity, and tourism surged: a record 3.5 million people visited the Kashmir Valley in 2024. Modi framed Kashmir’s “normalisation” as a political triumph, though simmering local discontent remained amid heavy militarisation.Chellaney said: “This kind of massacre is deeply embarrassing for any government, and doubly so for the Modi government, which projects itself as strong on national security.”The government must now weigh a response that balances domestic fury with strategic restraint. India andPakistanhave fought three wars – two over Kashmir – and have repeatedly come close to the brink. Underscoring the danger, Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, said on Friday there was risk of “all-out war” if India opted for a forceful military response.Chellaney said: “Modi has made strong statements in the past. But he’s a man who is reluctant to do kinetic action. He might hold back again, seeking instead to ease public anger through actions that stop short of full-scale military retaliation.”Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based analyst, said that while there was “much anger and tough rhetoric”, the government’s “actual response is likely to be careful and deliberate”. He said the government would “want to ensure any such action is well-planned and effective”.The memory of the2019 Pulwama attack, in which 40 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed in a suicide bombing claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed, looms large. The episode led to India launching the Balakot airstrikes deep inside Pakistan – its first such incursion since the 1971 war. While hailed domestically as a bold move, critics disputed the effectiveness of the strikes.Veteran analyst C Raja Mohan wrote in the Indian Express: “There are many imponderables Modi must deal with, including the significant capabilities of the Pakistan army. But given the horrific nature of the attack and the outrage that has convulsed the nation … the PM may have no option but to explore some major risks.”India believes an obscure group calling itself the Resistance Front, which claimed responsibility for the attack, is an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Islamist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was behind the deadly2008 Mumbai attacks. Pakistan denies any involvement, but India insists it has “clear evidence of cross-border complicity” and has named two of the terrorists as Pakistani nationals.Modi has vowed to “pursue the attackers and their handlers to the ends of the Earth” and “reduce to dust whatever little land these terrorists have”.Kugelman said: “It’s crucial to separate rhetoric from intent in this emotionally charged moment.”Chellaney concurs, noting that “Modi may have a reputation for strength, but in actual practice over 11 years, he has been averse to utilising the military for any cross-border mission”.That reluctance, however, is now being tested – not just by a shaken domestic audience and anger on social media, but by unusually vocal public grief in the Kashmir Valley itself. “There have been candlelit processions. It really is unprecedented – the anger in Kashmir,” Chellaney said. Kashmiris have flooded into the streets, waving placards saying: “United in Grief.”Kugelman, meanwhile, says that India’s symbolic moves carry weight. India has suspended the 1960 Indus waters treaty – a rare symbol of bilateral cooperation that had survived previous wars. Pakistan retaliated by suspending the 1972 Simla agreement, the basis for border management and dispute resolution.That may not be enough to assuage Indian public revulsion at the attack.“The global landscape – from Gaza to Ukraine – has made previously sacrosanct territorial arrangements seem less permanent. That context may yet embolden a tougher line from Delhi, but for now, Modi is walking a tightrope between nationalist expectations and strategic prudence,” Mohan said.Explore more on these topicsIndiaKashmirPakistanNarendra ModiSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

There is no firing on the civilian population. Life is normal. Schools are open,” said Gilani, a senior government official in Jhelum valley district.India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms that it said had been initiated by Pakistan, adding it had been “effectively responded to”.Three Indian army officials told Reuters that Pakistani soldiers used small-arms to fire at an Indian position. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with departmental policy, said Indian soldiers retaliated and no casualties were reported.There was no immediate comment from Pakistan, and the incident could not be independently verified. In the past, each side has accused the other of starting border skirmishes in Kashmir, which both claim in its entirety.India’s army chief, Gen Upendra Dwivedi, is to lead a high-level security review in Srinagar in Indian-held Kashmir on Friday, days after militants killed 26 civilians in the disputed region in one of theworst such attacks in years.The brazen assault, carried out in a mountain meadow near Pahalgam, has derailed prime minister Narendra Modi’s claims of restored calm in the restive Himalayan territory and sent tensions soaring between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan.Map of regionThe Indian army has launched sweeping “search-and-destroy” operations, deployed surveillance drones, and ramped up troop numbers across the Kashmir valley. The manhunt is searching for three suspects – one Indian national and two Pakistanis.Early on Friday, authorities in Indian Kashmir demolished the houses of two suspected militants, one of whom is an accused in Tuesday’s attack, according to an official.As tensions rise between the two countries, the UN has urged India and Pakistan to show restraint. The countries have imposedtit-for-tat diplomatic measuresover a deadly shooting in Kashmir.Relations haveplunged to their lowest level in years, with India accusing Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, after gunmen carried out the worst attack on civilians in contested Muslim-majority Kashmir in a quarter of a century.“We very much appeal to both the governments … to exercise maximum restraint, and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further,” the UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, told reporters in New York on Thursday.“Any issues between Pakistan and India, we believe, can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement.”1:10Tensions escalate between India and Pakistan after Kashmir attack – videoDwivedi’s visit to the regional capital underscores a sharp increase in military and diplomatic activity. India began large-scale air and naval drills on Thursday, which analysts say could pave the way for military action.The Indian air force’s Gagan Shakti exercises, showcasing its Rafale jets and elite strike squadrons, have assumed added urgency, while the navy has intensified manoeuvres and test-fired a surface-to-air missile.“There are many imponderables Modi must deal with, including the significant capabilities of the Pakistan army,” the veteran analystC Raja Mohan wrotein the Indian Express. “But given the horrific nature of the attack and the outrage that has convulsed the nation – the victims came from 15 states across India – the PM may have no option but to explore some major risks.”On the diplomatic front, India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, briefed envoys from 25 countries, including key G20 partners, Gulf states and, notably, China. Beijing’s inclusion, despite strained ties, was seen as an attempt to build broader global consensus.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Indian Secular Front, along with others, stage a protest over the killing of more than 25 tourists at Pahalgam.Photograph: Rupak De Chowdhuri/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockIndia presented what it called “clear evidence of cross-border complicity”.

Islamabad denied involvement, accusing India of failing to provide proof.On Thursday, Modi promised to capture the gunmen responsible forkilling 26 civilians, after Indian police identified two of the three fugitive assailants as Pakistani.“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” the prime minister said, in his first speech since Tuesday’s attack in the Himalayan region. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.”Denying any involvement, Islamabad called attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam attack “frivolous” and vowed to respond to any Indian action.“Any threat to Pakistan’s sovereignty and to the security of its people will be met with firm reciprocal measures in all domains,” a Pakistani statement said, after the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, held a rare national security committee meeting with top military chiefs.Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since its independence in 1947, with both claiming the territory in full but governing separate portions of it.Rebel groups have waged an insurgency in Indian-controlled Kashmir since 1989, demanding independence or a merger with Pakistan.1:17Manhunt launched after 26 tourists killed by suspected militants in Kashmir – videoA day after the attack, New Delhi suspended a water-sharing treaty, announced theclosure of the main land border crossingwith Pakistan, downgraded diplomatic ties, and withdrew visas for Pakistanis.In response, Islamabad ordered the expulsion of Indian diplomats and military advisers on Thursday, cancelling visas for Indian nationals – with the exception of Sikh pilgrims – and closing the main border crossing from its side.Pakistan also warned any attempt by India to stop the supply of water from the Indus River would be an “act of war”.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIndiaPakistanKashmirSouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

That line has been crossed.”A spokesperson said York Minster was working with the organisers to “ensure this event aligns with our values, and we are really excited by the opportunities it affords to showcase the minster’s musical tradition, building, and the diversity of the people who find a home here”.Explore more on these topicsYorkMetalChristianityReligionAnglicanismnewsShareReuse this content"

The EU was out in force, the US sent a top official, but China stayed away. Here’s what we learned.Energy security is national securityThough the geopolitical chasms between the US, China, Europe and Russia, and the gap between the rich world and the global south, yawned as wide as ever, there was one thing that all countries could agree on: having secure and reliable supplies of energy is a top priority for everyone, and those supplies are growing more insecure.“Energy security is national security,” declared Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, and none of the warring parties disagreed. Without energy security, modern societies and modern economies cannot function. Where countries have different ideas is on how to secure those energy supplies.Starmer made clear that he sees the UK’s future in terms of clean, low-carbon energy. In a sharp rebuttal to critics of net zero, in other parties and within Labour, he made astriking commitment to “accelerate” the push to decarbonise power. It was an unmistakable vote of confidence in Ed Miliband, the UK energy secretary, who has been the subject of unfriendly briefings from sections of his own party.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband, the UK energy secretary, and Fatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, at the summit in London.Photograph: Chris J Ratcliffe/EPAFossil fuels are not the answer – unless you are the USOne of the key themes brought up by delegates from Europe, the developing world and others, was the “weaponisation” of energy supplies in conflict, particularly byRussia in its invasion of Ukraine.Russia’s control of gas supplies sent prices of fossil fuels soaring, and inflation followed, generating a cost of living calamity with widespread pain for the less well-off around the world, and political crises for the parties in power in numerous countries.For the vast majority of countries at the conference, the lesson was to seek alternatives to fossil fuel energy. That has the added bonus of tackling the climate crisis, which is itsown source of geopolitical tension and looming planetary disaster.But petro states, and fossil fuel companies, werewell-represented among the 60 countries and 50 global companies present. The US was the most vocal supporter of fossil fuels. Tommy Joyce, acting assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, hushed a plenary session when he declared that the goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 was “harmful and dangerous”, and warned of “putting abstract emission goals in the interests of our adversaries first and the security of our people last”.China sees acting on climate as another way of building international relationshipsXi Jinping, the president of China, chose a small closed-door meeting of 18 world leaders convened by the UN on Tuesday to makehis biggest international intervention on the climate in several years. In pointed remarks, in which he did not mention the US or Donald Trump by name, he said: “Although some major country’s persistent pursuit of unilateralism and protectionism has seriously impacted international rules and the international order … as long as we enhance confidence, solidarity and cooperation, we will overcome the headwinds and steadily move forward global climate governance and all progressive endeavours of the world.”He sought to position China as a protector of developing countries, and a climate leader on the world stage. He vowed that China would “not slow down its climate actions”, and boasted that the country had “built the world’s largest and fastest-growing renewable energy systems as well as the largest and most complete new energy industrial chain”.China did not send a delegate to the London conference, which may have been of some help in ensuring the US was present.Andreas Sieber, associate director of global policy at the campaign group 350.org, said: “This is a major breakthrough … The question now is not whether China will act, but how far it is willing to go.”View image in fullscreenDelegates at an opening session on day two of the energy summit at Lancaster House.Photograph: Kin Cheung/PANuclear is a point of common ground for some countriesFatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, spent much of the conference emphasising that energy security was about all sources of energy. He was at particular pains to insist that oil and gas would be “part of the energy mix for years to come”.But he also had warm words for nuclear power. Despite its cost and the difficulties of building nuclear plants, not to mention the physical security of those plants and the problems of dealing with radioactive waste, nuclear power is attractive to many governments. This is because it offers baseload power generation, which can help to balance electricity grids with a high input from intermittent sources of renewable energy such as wind and solar.France has one of the world’s most highly developed nuclear power industries. Marc Ferracci, the energy minister, waseager to talk about the advantages. “Nuclear is still very attractive,” he said. “The cost can be high in the short run, but in the long run it provides dispatchability and baseload. It makes the electricity system more resilient, and that resilience is very important.”Milibandsingled out nuclear as one of the areas of “common ground” on energy and climate policy between the UK and the US.US rejection of climate policy could divert investment elsewhereDonald Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement and has been disrupting the renewable energy industry, calling a halt to an offshore windfarm off the coast of New York earlier this month, and threatening more action to stifle projects. Meanwhile, he is boosting fossil fuels.But there could beopportunities for other countries, which are open for business on renewable energy and seeking investors. On the eve of the summit, Starmer said: “Let my message to the world go out: come and build the clean energy future in Britain.”While he was not taking aim at the US, investors shunned in one major economy will have little difficulty in seeing where their capital will be welcomed.Critical minerals really are criticalEveryone wants to talk about critical minerals, the blanket term for metals andso-called “rare earth” elementsthat are essential to building clean and low-carbon technologies, from wind turbines and electric car batteries to solar panels and electricity grids. Critical minerals include a wide range of materials, including lithium and cobalt, more exotic sounding elements such as yttrium and scandium, and more common metals such as nickel and copper.Some of these elements are rare and others relatively common, but what unites them is increasing demand whilesourcing such materials is growing more difficult and costly, and processing them is often concentrated in the hands of a small number of specialist operations. China has a stranglehold on this market, processing 60% to 80% of the global supply of some of these materials.Joyce, the US delegate, warned “there are no alternatives” to China in sourcing critical minerals, urging countries to stick to oil and gas instead.David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, told a closed-door meeting at the conference that securing the supply chain of components for clean energy – from solar panels to electric vehicles – was the next challenge for decarbonising the planet. “The next mission of the Global Clean Power Alliance [agrouping spearheaded by the UK] addresses the need for resilient, secure, and low-cost clean energy supply chains. These vital chains are concentrated in a few markets, creating barriers to investment and limiting economic benefits. The responsibility rests on all our shoulders to lift these barriers.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyRenewable energyEnergy industryNuclear powerEd MilibandLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

I don’t think soDaniel BoffeyChief reporterFri 25 Apr 2025 14.12 EDTFirst published on Fri 25 Apr 2025 07.15 EDTShareKeir Starmer is facing a rebellion over his plan to use direct deductions from people’s bank accounts and the cancellation of driving licences as part of a government crackdown on welfare fraud and over-claiming.In an attempt to claw back the annual £9.7bn in benefit overpayments made by the Department for Work and Pensions due to fraud or error, the government has adopted Conservative plans for debt recovery.A fraud, error and recovery bill would give the DWP the power to require banks to provide data to help identify when an applicant is not meeting the eligibility criteria for a benefit for which they have applied.The bill would allow the government to demand bank statements to identify debtors who have sufficient funds to repay what they owe through fraud or error in a claim. The DWP would then have the power to recover money directly from bank accounts of those not on benefits or in PAYE employment who are identified as having the means to pay.Those who repeatedly fail to repay funds could fall prey to a suspended DWP disqualification order that would disqualify them from holding a driving licence.Liz Kendall, the secretary of state for work and pensions, has said the powers are necessary to deal with a “broken welfare system” but she is facing opposition from her own backbenches.Amendments tabled by theLabourMP for Poole, Neil Duncan-Jordan, that would force the government to drop key strands of the bill are supported by a growing number of MPs in Starmer’s party.The amendments, backed by 17 named Labour MPs, would ensure that only those suspected of fraud rather than being the victim of an error were subjected to surveillance, “allowing the government to target criminality without monitoring the public”, Duncan-Jordan said.The Labour MP is also proposing to remove the power to apply to a court to strip people of their driving licences due to debt, describing the policy as a “poverty penalty”.Writing in the Guardian, Duncan-Jordan, who was elected for the first time in 2024, accused Starmer’s government of “resurrecting Tory proposals for mass spying on people who receive state support”.He writes that the legislation “would compel banks to carry out financial surveillance of welfare recipients”, adding that “given the volume of accounts involved, this will be completed by an algorithm”.“If the software flags a possible overpayment, whether due to fraud or error, the bank will report the individual to the Department for Work and Pensions for further investigation,” Duncan-Jordan writes. “By default, welfare recipients would be treated as suspects, simply because they need support from the state.”He adds that the government should learn from the Post Office scandal in which a faulty computer system led to hundreds of people being falsely accused of fraud and error.He writes: “The risk of aHorizon-style scandalon a massive scaleis glaringly obviouswhen millions are being monitored. It will be disabled people, carers, pensioners and the very poorest people who are impacted by wrongful investigations and forced to endure burdensome appeals to prove their innocence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All the powers in the bill are underpinned by a principle of fairness and proportionality and do not involve mass surveillance of people’s bank accounts.“This includes utilising limited data from banks to help verify entitlement to benefits, helping us detect errors earlier and minimise debts accruing for claimants.”Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsLabourKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

Video of the incident showed him taking out the heavy tool and then repeatedly swinging it at Pyke’s head.Pyke fell to the floor and attempted to kick away Felton before colleagues at St Joseph’s Roman Catholic comprehensive school in Aberavon, southWales, heard the disturbance and came to his aid.When graphic CCTV footageof the incident was played to Swansea crown court there were gasps in the public gallery at the ferocity of the attack.Ieuan Rees, for the prosecution, said Felton believed Pyke had slept with another teacher with whom he had recently been in a relationship.“The evidence of his wife and the admissions he made to her suggested Mr Felton had been in a relationship with another member of staff and had recently discovered he was the father of her child,” he said.“Furthermore, he believed that Mr Pyke had now begun his own relationship with that lady.”After the attack, Felton fled the school in his car and then emailed staff to apologise “for the problems and distress his actions were likely to cause”, the court heard.Felton, who had been headteacher since September 2023, pleaded guilty to attempted grievous bodily harm with intent, at a hearing earlier this month.In a victim impact statement address to Felton, Pyke said: “You had my complete trust in every way and you used that to manoeuvre me into a position of utter vulnerability. And then you attacked me from behind.”He added: “The fear that you could attempt to do me such harm, smiling at me just seconds before, will always be with me.”On Friday, Judge Paul Thomas sentenced Felton to two years and four months in jail and issued an indefinite restraining order.The judge said the “ambush” by a headteacher on their deputy was: “I suspect, entirely without precedent”.He added: “You are more than intelligent enough to realise when you plotted this bizarre attack that the impact and ramifications would be immense and far-reaching.“Ultimately, the trigger for your act of extreme violence was of your own doing, the overwhelming sexual jealousy arising from an adulterous affair and the uncontrollable rage it created in you.”John Hipkin KC, speaking for the defence, said Felton had recently suffered due to the death of his mother and a cancer diagnosis.After the attack, police said Pyke had been discharged from hospital after suffering minor injuries.Explore more on these topicsUK newsCrimeWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, also said he wanted to bring together a coalition of the right, though he insisted he was talking about bringing back voters,not a deal with Farage’s party.Is one-nation Toryism dead? Not yet, but it can’t let Reform and the right provide all the answers | Henry HillRead moreMany Tories believe Jenrick has already embarked on a thinly disguised leadership campaign, which he denies. Houchen is also thought of as a possible future leadership contender, with some of his rivals believing he could give up his peerage and seek to enter parliament through a byelection.Conservative MPs said privately that there were constant whispers and rumours in the tea rooms about “regicide” of Badenoch by submitting letters of no confidence if the results next week are a wipeout, although the majority view was that it would not be possible after giving her such a short time in charge.Jenrick on Friday said he was on “exactly the same page” as Badenoch, and wanted to “put Reform out of business”. He also said he thought Badenoch was doing a “bloody good job” and called for people to “give her a break”.Jenrick weighed in behind his leader in an interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain about his campaign against stolen tools, which sources said had been set up initially without the knowledge of Conservative HQ – although he approached Badenoch for permission to make the media appearance on Thursday and was given approval to go ahead. Both their teams insisted it was fully sanctioned and there was nothing unusual about the process.In her own remarks to reporters on Friday, Badenoch confirmed: “We are not doing a deal with Reform, there’s not going to be a pact. What we need to do right now is focus on ensuring that voters have a credible Conservative offer.”Mitchell, an ex-chief whip and development secretary, said his colleagues should heed the historic words of Rear Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan-Giles who told the 1922 Committee in 1971: “Pro bono publico, no bloody panico”.“Reform is trying to destroy the Conservative party and at the last election Reform may have taken five seats off us but the Lib Dems took nearly 60,” Mitchell said. “The right way to deal with Reform is not to talk about deals, which is a sign of weakness, but spend time developing the right policies.“Leading the Conservative party now is an extremely difficult job and I don’t believe the archangel Gabriel would be doing a better job.”View image in fullscreenSome moderate Conservative MPs say they want to see less aping of Nigel Farage’s Reform and a ‘more honest’ case for why the Tories should be the answer.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAHis position was echoed by Simon Hoare, a former housing minister, who said: “Without sounding too much like Corporal Jones, this is ‘don’t panic’.“It’s an early staging post after the general election. A parliament is a marathon not a sprint. We are not even a year since the general election, and it will be a five year parliament. We’ve got to take our fences slowly and steadily and our key challenge as a parliamentary party is to prove ourselves steady under fire, [and be] calm, rational and mature.”Another senior Conservative said the “prevailing mood is headless chicken” in relation to Reform, but MPs need to “stop panicking about Reform and think how bad it would look” to depose another leader.Glen, who attended cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury, said Badenoch had been elected after “an exhaustive process” and that she has been in post for less than six months.“The next general election is over four years away and all Conservative MPs know we have a lot of hard work ahead to rebuild trust,” he said. “There are no short cuts to this process but Kemi has set out the pathway to recovery based on thorough policy work and honesty with the electorate. Next week’s elections are likely to be tough but I have every confidence Kemi has a clear plan and she should not be pushed off course by any outcome we face next week.”Some moderate Conservative MPs, however, said they wanted to see less aping of Reform and a “much more honest” case for why theConservativesshould be the answer. A former minister said the message should be that those voting Reform have “legitimate grievances” especially on economics, and a clear offer with serious policymaking to address how Britain’s low wage economy and open welfare state is “sucking in migrants”.On the prospect of a deal with Reform, one centrist MP said: “I can see why some people would welcome this as a sort of instant hit, something which might give a quick boost, but in the longer term it would make it much harder for us to win elections, and it would really risk splitting the party.“Views are mixed, but there would be a significant number of people who would just not be comfortable campaigning under a Reform banner. And if you think about the areas where we lost so many seats to the Lib Dems, it would make things even worse. As a statement of intent it’s pretty big: as a party we have decided to effectively abandon one wing of opinion.”Another sceptical Tory MP said uniting the Conservatives and Reform would be an “unbelievably poisonous marriage” that would not be sustainable.Explore more on these topicsConservativesReform UKKemi BadenochRobert JenrickAndrew MitchellnewsShareReuse this content"

The Teamsters union lobbied heavily for the bill.California currently prohibits any type of autonomous vehicle that weighs more than 10,000lbs on public roads.The proposed regulations for heavy-duty trucks aim toenhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers, such as reporting instances when cars stop in the middle of an active road for any reason and need to be retrieved. They will give the state’s DMV more authority to apply “incremental enforcement measures” against companies instead of fully suspending their testing permits.The DMVsuspendedthe permit of driverless car company Cruise in 2023 after one of the company’s self-driving carsstruck a pedestrian in San Francisco.

Between international tariffs, the wars inUkraineand in Gaza, the Trump team’s open antipathy toward Europe and its hard line on immigration from Central and South America, the papal funeral could prove to be a minefield of international diplomacy.When is Pope Francis’s funeral, who will be there and what happens nextRead moreTrump’s international engagements in the past have set the stage for some of his most explosive confrontations, and he has bristled at world leaders who have criticised him publicly and castigated those he views as insufficiently deferential. Gatherings of world leaders have set the stage for some of his most divisive debates, such as the 2018 G7 meeting that saw him clash with Angela Merkel and other western leaders, or the2017 Nato summitat which he famouslyshoved past the Montenegrin prime ministerto get to the front of a group photograph.View image in fullscreenMontenegro’s prime minister, Dusko Markovic, center right, smiles after appearing to be pushed by Donald Trump, center left, during a Nato summit in 2017.Photograph: Matt Dunham/APCompounding tensions are theTrump administration’s difficult relationship with the Vatican itself, including Pope Francis’s criticism of Trump’s deportation policies as a“major crisis”and declaration that “builders of walls sow fear”.Adding to the diplomatic minefield, it was announced on Friday that the former president Joe Biden, whom Trump has repeatedly and continually criticised, would also attend the funeral. Trump’s predecessor is a lifelong Catholic who had metPope Francisseveral times and awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom in January before leaving the White House.There is little doubt that Trump’s trip to theVatican– which Italy has encased in a “ring of steel” with Nato jets, snipers and thousands of police at the ready – will provide plenty of white-knuckle moments as the volatile US president navigates controversy amid the pomp and circumstance of a papal funeral.Assuming Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends – on Friday he said “military meetings” might preclude him from making the trip – the funeral will be the first time the Ukrainian leader has been in the same place as Trump since the US president and the vice-president, JD Vance,berated himin the White House in February. Trump cut short that meeting, saying Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three” and being “very disrespectful”. He has now floated the prospect of the US recognising Russian control of Crimea and accused Zelenskyy of delaying a peace deal, testing the Ukrainian president’s patience and raising the danger of a new meltdown in bilateral relations.8:25In full: Zelenskyy and Trump meeting descends into heated argument in front of the press – videoThen there are the EU leaders, members of a bloc that Trump has said was “formed to screw the United States”. At their head is the EU commission president,Ursula von der Leyen. Despite imposing (and then pausing) a 20% tariff on all goods from the EU, Trump and von der Leyen have not spoken directly or arranged an EU-US summit over the brewing trade war, meaning a meeting on the sidelines of the funeral could be well-timed. Von der Leyen had tacitly criticised the US in print, saying that Europe has “no bros and no oligarchs” and that “the west as we knew it no longer exists.”But there are some bright spots in the crowd for Trump. Italy’s Giorgia Meloni will attend following a friendly White House visit earlier this month that marked her ascent as one of the key envoys between Europe and the United States. And EU officialshave been saidto believe a summit with the US is within reach, with Trump saying that “there’ll be a trade deal, 100%”. France’s Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer have also hammered out friendly relationships with Trump, and the outgoing Polish president, Andrzej Duda, who was viewed as that country’s best conduit to Trump, will also attend.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Among them is Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the leftwing leader who said of Trump’s tariffs: “It’s not going to work.” No high-level officials from China will take part in the funeral, curbing the potential for sideline discussions or a standoff over the trade war between Washington and Beijing.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump awkwardly shakes hands with Emmanuel Macron at a Nato summit in 2017.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesVladimir Putin has also decided to deploy a fairly low-level official, the culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, as Russia’s envoy to the funeral, meaning that important contacts over a potential peace deal on the Russian war in Ukraine are unlikely to take place.Israel meanwhile will be represented by its ambassador to the Vatican, in contrast to Pope John Paul II’s funeral in 2005, when the country sent a presidential delegation. The apparent snub follows the late Pope Francis’s criticism of the war in Gaza; the Times of Israel quoted an Israeli diplomat calling the delegation a “low point in a spiral”. Pope Francis had repeatedly slammed Israel’s “cruelty” in Gaza and had called the humanitarian situation there “shameful” in January. The absence of a high-level delegation from Israel will reduce the likelihood of substantive discussions over the war following the collapse of the ceasefire negotiated earlier in Trump’s term.Trump has said that he is planning to meet foreign leaders during the trip, although he has not specified whom. “I have a lot of meetings set up,” Trump said.Yet he will not be seated front and centre at the funeral. In the areas allocated to foreign leaders, the front rows are designated for Catholic royalty, which will include King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain. Then would come the non-Catholic royalty, including Prince William in the place of his father, King Charles III. And finally come other foreign leaders, including Trump.The greatest wildcard remains Trump’s own behaviour at the funeral. While he has clashed with European leaders at past summits, he has also toned down his criticism of opponents during public appearances as well. At Jimmy Carter’s funeral in January, Trump sat next to Barack Obama, a rival whom he has publicly attacked for more than a decade, and yet the two traded jokes and smiled while speaking during the service. Then he complained about flags in the US flying at half-mast during the mourning period that coincided with his inauguration.The US president has never been known for his tact. And as world leaders gather in the Vatican this weekend and millions tune in to follow the funeral, it is Washington that will be sending the elephant in the room.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyPope FrancisUkraineJoe BidenVaticanVolodymyr ZelenskyyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Neither she nor Khalil have been charged with any crimes and appear to have been targeted solely for their political views in a Trump administration crackdown thatgoes far beyondthe undocumented immigrant communities that Trump pledged to expel when he was running for a second term.View image in fullscreenRümeysa Öztürk.Photograph: Courtesy of the Öztürk family/Reuters“This is not immigration enforcement” the lawmakers wrote. “This is repression. This is authoritarianism.”They warned that Öztürk’s case “is not an isolated one.“This administration has already overseen a wave of unconstitutional actions: raids without warrants, prolonged detentions without hearings and retaliatory deportations,” they wrote.The lawmakers cautioned that each case “chips away at the rule of law”, “makes it easier for the next to go unnoticed”, and “brings us closer to the authoritarianism we once believed could never take root on American soil.“When a government begins to imprison writers for their words, when it abandons legal norms for political convenience, when it cloaks oppression in the language of national security, alarm bells must ring. Loudly,” they wrote.They called for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to release Öztürk immediately, to drop any proceedings against her and to investigate theconditions at the detention centerwhere she is being held.They also urged their Republican colleagues “to stand up to President Trump’s evident disregard for the rule of law.“And we urge every American to understand: This is not someone else’s fight,” they conclude. “The Constitution is only as strong as our willingness to defend it.”Also, in Khalil’s case, lawyers for DHS disclosed incourt documentsthat they did not have a warrant when they arrested him last month.The attorneys representing the administrationarguedon Thursday that “officers had exigent circumstances to conduct the warrantless arrest” and said that agents believed Khalil would “escape before they could obtain a warrant”.Khalil’s legal team hasarguedthat Khalil’s removal proceedings should be terminated since he was arrested without a warrant. His lawyers also stated that Khalil had no plans to flee or leave the country, and emphasized that he “fully complied with the agents arresting him, despite the fact that after repeated requests by Khalil, his pregnant wife, and his lawyer, they never showed him a warrant”.

Even after Trump paused the highest of his reciprocal tariffs, causing stock markets to rise, consumer inflation expectations still remained much higher compared with March.Higher inflation expectations have also been paired with consumers anticipating slower income growth for the year ahead, meaning that more of them will be hesitant to spend in the months ahead – which all could ultimately mean a slowdown in the economy.“Without reliably strong incomes, spending is unlikely to remain strong amid the numerous warning signs perceived by consumers,” Hsu said.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsTrump administrationGlobal economyUS politicsTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

This week, the president suggested he could cut the tariffs on China“substantially”– theWall Street Journalreported the cuts could bring rates down to 50% and 65%.But business leaders who spoke to the Guardian warned tariffs were unlikely to achieve Trump’s stated aim of bringing more manufacturing back to the US and that businesses would fail as a result of the hikes.Steven Borrelli, founder of fashion brand Cuts Clothing, voted forDonald Trumpin 2016, 2020 and 2024. He backs the US president’s controversial plan to use sweeping tariffs on imports to boost the economy. But he also wants a rethink.“He’s pro-business, and I don’t believe he wants to hurt American jobs,” Borelli said in an interview. “We’re onboard for this plan – just give us more time,” he added. “We just want more time with any policy changes to adjust, to not destroy our business in the meantime.”“Every day this continues, more businesses will fail,” he warned last week in apublic pleato Trump on X, formerly Twitter, calling for a delay of up to a year. “I trust him to do the right thing,” Borelli said. “I just hope he knows he needs to do it fast.”The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Borelli’s plea.From peppercorns to plastic forks: US businesses that rely on Chinese products reel from Trump tariffsRead moreEntrepreneur Todd Shelton runs an eponymous fashion brand with a factory in East Rutherford, New Jersey. While the firm makes its clothes in the US, 100% of the material it uses is sourced from overseas, meaning higher duties and higher costs.This dilemma is not unique in the industry, according to Shelton. “All competitors are exposed to it,” he said. “It will create price increases for the customer. There’s nothing that can be done about it.”“This is truly going to be inflationary, and will do nothing to bring back jobs,” said Nate Herman, senior vice-president for policy at the American Apparel & Footwear Association. He noted tariffs had been raised across the board: not only on finished clothes from overseas, but key supplies for companies making clothes inside the US, including yarns, fabrics, buttons and zippers.“You’re hurting the very manufacturers you’re supposedly trying to help here,” he said.Ultimately, this will hit consumers, added Herman. “All you’re doing is hurting American families [shopping] for a necessity,” he said. “Everybody needs to wear clothes and shoes.”Prices will “inevitably” increase if tariffs remain in place, said Lance Ruttenberg, who runs American Textile Company, a leading bedding manufacturer based in Duquesne, Pennsylvania. “Across every single industry, it’s hard to think of an industry where prices won’t need to increase.“I don’t think this is sophisticated economics,” he added. “The price of inputs is going up. That will change the pricing dynamics of all the goods that are affected by them.”About 30% of the supply chain of American Textile Company is in China. The new steep US tariffs on Chinese exports mean it “is not possible” for the firm to buy what it typically sources from the country, Ruttenberg said in an interview. “When that inventory runs down, we will be in no position to replenish them.”The company was “bracing for a significant reduction in our ability to run our manufacturing facilities”, he added, unless the tariffs are scrapped or lowered. “You lose the revenue, you lose the manufacturing, and then consequently, you lose people. Eventually, it’s very problematic.”Even before the tariffs were enforced this month, let alone reached customers in the form of price increases, companies say they were already having an impact on demand.“We’ve certainly felt it in the form of customer confidence – just the chaos that it’s caused,” said Shelton. “That started in March. Our customers started to understand that something was happening. That led to this uncertainty.”Few in the industry believe tariffs can swiftly revive US manufacturing, as Trump and his officials have suggested. And they fear other policies advanced by the administration will actively hinder the domestic apparel sector’s growth.US clothing factories struggle to attract American workers. Firms put this down to a lack of vocational training for young people – something they fear is likely to get worse as Trump moves to dismantle the Department of Education.While the industry has increasingly sought to alleviate labor shortages by hiring workers from overseas, some operators are concerned that this could be undermined by Trump’s crackdown on immigration.“While I appreciate and love the idea of Americans at work – who wouldn’t support this? – in our particular world, we don’t believe there are any people who aspire to do the kind of jobs we now rely on from the far east,” said Ruttenberg.“I don’t know what jobs the administration wants to bring back that have left,” he added. “But I’m pretty confident that the jobs in the textile space are not the jobs they are trying to fill. If they are, we’re in big trouble.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsEconomicsDonald TrumpTariffsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was wearing tan jail garb with a white long-sleeved undershirt. He spoke with his lawyers, who sat alongside him, and at one point appeared to smile; he could be seen flipping through papers on the table.Judge Margaret M Garnett asked Mangione to stand, and Mangione confirmed to the justice that he had seen a copy of this indictment and had had enough time to discuss it with his lawyers.Garnett asked Mangione his plea. Mangione said: “Not guilty.”Mangione could face the death penalty in a case that shocked America for the killing of a top business executive on New York’s streets but also triggered an outpouring of anger against the country’s for-profit healthcare industry.As with previous proceedings, throngs of supporters of Mangione queued up outside to secure a much-coveted seat in court. Many sported medical masks or sunglasses, or both, and were reticent about speaking to media but did attack the healthcare system.The alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer faces the death penalty. Will a jury impose that punishment?Read more“I am a chronically ill person. I live in chronic pain,” one woman said in explaining why she was at court. She said that she had never been in “that much medical debt” compared to others, but “when I say not that much I mean like $30,000.”Even if it were proved that Mangione killed Thompson, she said, she believed his guilt embodies an ethical grey area. The healthcare industry kills thousands and Thompson was one man, she said. “One life [versus] like a thousand lives, that moral dilemma,” she said.When asked about the announcement prosecutors would seek the death penalty, she said: “It’s state-sanctioned murder.“He’s a political prisoner – school shooters don’t get that.”As those waiting in line chatted among themselves, an LCD-screen truck, displaying support of Mangione, repeatedly drove by the courthouse. One image featured a photo of Mangione smiling that read: “END THE DEATH PENALTY NOW.” The intelligence whistleblower Chelsea Manning was also among those in line.Mangione’s arraignment comes months after his arrest for allegedly gunning down Thompson outside a New York hotel on 4 December. He was apprehended on 9 December at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a restaurant worker purportedlyrecognized himfrom law enforcement advisories and tipped off police.In federal court, Mangione faces stalking, murder through use of a firearm, and firearms offense charges. Mangione is also charged with a host of murder and firearms counts in New York state court.Pennsylvania state prosecutors are also pursuing a case against him related to alleged weapons possession and false identification. He has also maintained his innocence in the state cases.While Mangione was already staring down the prospect of life imprisonment following his arrest,Donald Trump’s attorney general,Pam Bondi, raised the stakes several weeks ago by announcing that she was directing prosecutorsto seekthedeath penalty.Bondi called Thompson’s killing “a premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”. Shestatedthat her decision was in keeping with “President Trump’s agenda to stop violent crime and Make America Safe Again”.‘Hannibal Lecter’ treatment of Luigi Mangione ‘backfired’, says fundraising organizerRead moreIn court, Garnett cautioned prosecutors against making inflammatory statements. She urged them to abide by local court rules that bar attorneys from making “public commentary that could impede Mr Mangione’s right to a fair trial” and to pick a fair jury.“I’m specifically directing the government to convey my directive to Mr Clayton,” Garnett said, referring to acting Manhattan federal prosecutor Jay Clayton. The judge also directed that prosecutors “request that he convey the same to Attorney General Bondi” and her associates.The last time federal prosecutors in Manhattan pursued the death penalty was in the case ofSayfullo Saipov, an Islamist extremist who murdered eight people in a truck attack.During the penalty phase of Saipov’s trial, jurors could not unanimously decide on whether to impose a death sentence, resulting in him being automatically sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole.Gregory Germain, a professor of law at Syracuse University’s College of Law, previously told the Guardian that nearly all recent federal death penalty cases took place during Trump’s first term.Germain said hebelievedthat Trump’s justice department would not agree to an deal in which Mangione pleaded guilty in exchange for a life sentence.“He has political reasons, wanting to seem ‘tough on crime’ by supporting the death penalty,” Germain said.Karen Friedman Agnifilo, Mangione’s lead defense attorney, raised several constitutional points during the proceeding. She said there was a “handshake deal” forged between Manhattan prosecutors and Biden’s justice department, under which his state case would be tried first.But now that federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, Friedman Agnifilo said they would fight this plan.“It’s partly scheduling, your honor, but it’s also constitutional issues [that] are going to be impacted if we are forced to try that case first,” she said.Friedman Agnifilo also alleged in court that authorities had been listening in on Mangione’s privileged communications.“We were just informed by the state court prosecutors that they were eavesdropping on all of Mr Mangione’s calls,” she said. “They were listening to his attorney calls and all of his other calls going on. They said it was inadvertent that they were listening to a call between Mr Mangione and me.”Friedman Agnifilo asked the judge to put a directive in place to prevent this from happening again. Garnett asked the prosecutor Dominic Gentile about the alleged recording.Gentile said this was “the very first we’ve heard of this situation” and that such would not be “normal practice”.Garnett told Gentile that she wanted prosecutors to file a letter within seven days outlining what they knew about the recording.Explore more on these topicsNew YorkBrian Thompson shootingLaw (US)US crimeUS healthcarenewsShareReuse this content"

Apple is secretive about details of its production processes but analysts estimate that about 90% of its iPhones are assembled in the country.According to the FT, Apple plans to source fromIndiathe more than 60m iPhones sold in the US annually by the end of 2026 – a commitment that would require more than doubling iPhone assembly in India.Apple has already been ramping up production in India and diverting iPhones assembled in the country to the US. The company’s main Indian suppliers, Foxconn and Tata, shipped almost $2bn worth of handsets to their largest market in March asApplesought to offset the impact of looming tariffs.It also chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tonnes of iPhones – or as many as 1.5m devices – to the US to ensure sufficient inventory in an important market. Apple has three plants in India and last month temporarily extended operations to Sunday working at the biggestFoxconnIndia factory in Chennai.More than 5o% of Apple’s Mac products and 80% of its iPads are assembled in China as well, according to US investment bank Evercore. Apple watches are largely built in Vietnam.Analysts do not expect Apple to move iPhone production to the US, despite the White House insisting that the manufacturing of an American tech product willultimately return home. The US president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that Apple’s recent announcement of a $500bn investment indicated a US-made iPhone was possible.“IfAppledidn’t think the US could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,” she said.However, experts have played down the prospect. Wedbush Securities, a US financial firm, said the cost of an American-made iPhone would more than treble if production was shifted to the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Georgieva spoke of “major trade policy shifts” that had “spiked uncertainty off the charts”.Central bankers earnestly discussed how best to portray today’s heightened uncertainty to the public. Perhaps, mused the Bank of England’s deputy governor Clare Lombardelli, they could learn from the way medics communicated during the Covid pandemic.And the IMF suggested regulators keep a close watch on economic institutions, warning of “further shocks, corrections of asset prices, and tightening of financial conditions”.Yet as one UK official privately acknowledged, it often felt as though the real action this week was happening not in the IMF – the spiritual home of the “Washington consensus” of free-market neoliberalism – but up the road at the White House, where what remains of that consensus was being torched.Away from the public eye, policymakers at the IMF speculated about who is up and who is down in the administration, and what that may mean for its direction.Trump’s apparent softening of his stance earlier this weekon sky-high tariffs against China, and insistence he isnot about to sack Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, stoked hopes that the relatively more moderate Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, has a stronger influence than the president’s tear-it-all-down trade adviser,Peter Navarro.It appears unlikely to have been as a result of the IMF’s warning on Tuesday of a“major negative shock”from the tariffs.View image in fullscreenIMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva tried to portray a sense of calm at the talks in Washington.Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPAInstead, many observers pointed to the influence of themighty bond markets– the agents of Liz Truss’s destruction. Even after markets recovered some ground this week, bond investors still appeared to be demanding an additional risk premium to hold US Treasuries, usually considered the ultimate haven.With Trump’s administration hoping to drive down Treasury yields – and hence the interest rate on the monster US debt-pile – it is likely to be this, rather than moral suasion from the world’s finance ministers, that sways him in the coming weeks and months.Indeed, there were signs everywhere in Washington that policymakers are keen to show they accept aspects of the administration’s worldview.Rachel Reeves, who was to lobby Bessent on tariff exemptions for the UK, told guests at a drinks reception hosted by the British ambassador, Peter Mandelson, that she shared some of Trump’s concerns about persistent trade deficits – if not his approach to resolving them.“There’s been a feeling in my country, and in America and in many other developed countries, that the system we have today delivers for some but not for all, and jobs have been hollowed out in some sectors of the economy,” the chancellor said. “It does matter where things are made and who makes them, and we can’t be agnostic or naive about that.”Meanwhile, the IMF and World Bank reined in their rhetoric about how they see their role, even beforeBessent himself accused them of “mission creep”in a speech on Wednesday. He claimed the IMF spent too much time on “climate change, gender, and social issues” and that the World Bank expected “blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Bessent suggested they had “enduring value” – as long as they don’t overstep their core tasks.Accordingly, both the World Bank president, Ajay Banga, and Georgieva framed their role in every public utterance as about jobs, growth and stability. One politician attending described Banga admiringly as “an operator”.A longtime observer of the institutions, Prof Richard Kozul-Wright, of Soas University of London, said the change in emphasis was stark. “I’ve found it quite shocking, how craven they can be: six months ago they were going to save the planet,” he said.Bessent suggested he wanted to see the IMF acting on some of the White House’s concerns about the global economy – including what it sees as excessive currency depreciation, and a failure by economies including China to stoke sufficient domestic demand: the latter a widely shared diagnosis among experts.But Kozul-Wright said the Bretton Woods institutions, which have to answer to all their members, were ill-fitted for the task. “They can’t be an overt mouthpiece for the Trump agenda,” he said.While the US president has been smashing up the global trading system, and rocking the world’s financial architecture in the process, other pillars of the Washington consensus seemed as solid as ever this week.Georgieva lavished praise on Javier Milei’s government in Argentina, with which the IMF recently agreed a massive $20bn support package, for its drastic public spending cuts and agenda of slashing red tape.She proudly pinned on a small badge featuring Milei’s trademark chainsaw, handed to her on stage by the country’s minister of deregulation, Federico Sturzenegger, who had just finished a lengthy digression about overzealous US regulation of watermelon exports.As if to emphasise how fleeting any hopes of calm may be, Trump gave adefiant Time interviewas policymakers prepared to leave Washington this weekend, saying he would consider it a “total victory”, if tariffs were still as high as 20% or even 50% in a year’s time.With his punitive paused “reciprocal” tariffs still hanging over the global economy, IMF delegates will take home with them a sense of foreboding for what lies ahead.Explore more on these topicsInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)World BankEconomicsGlobal economyDonald TrumpTariffsEconomic policyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it came after anonymous backstabs and the harsh glare of the spotlightFri 25 Apr 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 12.37 EDTShareTheNFLdraft can be cruel. Shedeur Sanders, a polarizing prospect in a weak class whose profile was magnified by the fact that he is the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, had to sit and wait for his name to be called in Thursday night’s first round. He waited. And waited. By night’s end, Sanders had fallen out of the first round entirely.Only two quarterbacks were selected on Thursday.After Miami’s Cam Ward was selected No 1 overall, the QB-needy teams at the top of the board opted to punt on quarterbacks in favor of chasing defensive studs or linemen who could protect their eventual starter.So, Sanders sat and watched as the Browns passed on him. Then the Giants. Then the Steelers. As Sanders continued to tumble, draft staple Mel Kiper Jr moved from incredulous to distraught, makinga series of impassioned pleas on ESPN’s broadcastforsomeoneto draft the Colorado quarterback.Then there was a glimmer of hope. The Giants, who had first picked at No 3 and were in desperate need of a viable starter, traded back into the first round, picking up the No 26 selection. But they opted instead for Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, preferring his size and athleticism to Sanders’s more cerebral play. With the final few picks of the night available in a cheap trade, the Browns and Raiders, potential destinations to scoop up the quarterback in the second round, decided to pass.NFL draft: Jags trade up for Travis Hunter as QB-needy teams pass on Shedeur SandersRead more“We all didn’t expect this, of course,” Sanders told the crowd at his draft watch party. “I don’t feel like this happened for no reason. All this is, of course, fuel to the fire. We all know this shouldn’t have happened. But we understand, we’re on to bigger and better things.”Sanders’s slide was the story of the evening, but it shouldn’t be all that surprising. ESPN’s prediction model gave a 96% chance that Sanders would be off the board by the 21st pick, but the league has been barking out for months that, as a collective, it did not view Sanders as a first-round talent. He lacks high-end arm talent, holds on to the ball too long, can be slow to read coverages, played in a wonky offense at Colorado and did so while throwing to the best player in the country. This is not the same as Aaron Rodgers at the 2005 draft, zombie-staring ahead in the green room as the league told him en masse,we don’t think you’re very good.Sanders is not a one-man franchise, capable of ruthlessly dicing teams up from the pocket or creating his own offense out of structure. To succeed at the next level, Sanders will need the ancillary pieces – the offensive line, the scheme, the playmakers – to be on point. Most rebuilding teams lack those pieces – it made sense to address them before circling back to Sanders.On talent alone, Sanders profiles as a day two prospect. But given that it was a weak quarterback class, that there were plenty of QB-hungry teams and the class as a whole lacked star power at the top, he was pushed up into the early first-round discussion. That’s not on Sanders, it speaks more to the warped incentives and narratives that define the pre-draft process. It was more of a perceived slide than a real one.Whatever the merits of Sanders as a prospect, he has also been on the receiving end of the worst part of the draft industrial complex. Anonymous scouts and coaches have spent months teeing off on his character and ability. “He’s so entitled,” a coach told NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero. “He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates, but the biggest thing is, he’s not that good.” Another executive told ESPN’s Josina Anderson that Sanders was “brash” and “arrogant” during his interview at the NFL Combine. Days before the first round, another anonymous voice called Sanders the “worst interview ever.”Crushing the character of a prospect is the anonymous executive’s favorite pastime. For a league that preaches accountability and leadership, the NFL loves nothing more than unloading on college students behind the protection of a reporter’s phone. “It represents everything I dislike about the NFL draft,” Joel Klatt said on NFL Network’s broadcast, calling league executives “trash” for leaking information about Sanders during the pre-draft process.It is a rite of passage for prospects who do not look or sound like the quarterbacks who grumpy scouts grew up working around. But the reality is that teams will overlook players who do not fit the traditional archetype if the evidence that they can play is on tape. Even Caleb Williams was put under the microscope last year. Teams questioned how the unanimous top selection dressed, his emotional EQ and – shock, horror – that he dared to question teams about their plans rather than sitting back and minding his Ps and Qs. If you’re too nonchalant, that’s a problem. But if you see yourself as the CEO of Caleb Williams Industries, that’s a problem, too. The same mind-numbing leaks were sent to the same sources: Williams wasarrogant, his dad was a “problem,” and he didn’t fit somevague notion of masculinity. But none of that mattered on draft night. Williams was such an overwhelming talent that he still sat at the top of draft boards for most teams and was selected by the Bears with the first pick. Sanders isn’t that kind of needle mover, allowing the anonymous to comfortably hide behind their reservations about him.Teams are also worried about the influence of his father. Shedeur has never played for a coach other than Deion. He started his college career at Jackson State, with Coach Prime guaranteeing his son a starting job and pairing him with Travis Hunter, the top recruit in high school and the eventual Heisman Trophy winner. When the NFL world was quiet on Shedeur’s pro potential, the Sanders family moved their headquarters to Colorado. Shedeur was again installed as the starter, and Hunter followed them to Boulder. Hunter went on to light up college football, leading to theJags’ blockbuster tradeto move up and grab the unicorn receiver/cornerback with the No 2 overall pick. But for Sanders, the move posed more questions.Travis Hunter wants to be the NFL’s Shohei Ohtani. Will anyone let him?Read moreUsually, scouts salivate over the idea of a quarterback who is a coach’s kid. But with Sanders, playing for a Hall of Famer who happens to be his father was viewed as a negative. And there was a sense that Shedeur’s draft stock was as important as winning games.Coach Prime takes the criticism personally. “Just say you don’t like me,”he told USA Todaybefore the draft about the critiques of his son. “Just say you’re tired of me winning, you’re tired of me being the light, tired of me being up, just consistently provoking change wherever I go. Just say that. But don’t attack my kids because of that.”And there is the dichotomy. Teams want a coach’s son. But maybe notDeion’sson. Sanders Sr, one of the most talented players in NFL history and a huge personality, can pick up the phone to any coach, executive or media figure in the game. He may be the only coach in college football who can call the NFL commissioner and not be put on hold. With a tweet or YouTube video, he can tilt the league’s conversation. Some teams may not want to sign up for the eventual storm if Shedeur is sat on the bench behind a starter who stinks. Who knows, in a year, Coach Prime may want to coach his son in the NFL himself – and coaches do not want that presence breathing down their necks.Teams, however, would overlook that if Sanders were a sure-fire starter. There is a path for Sanders to become a quality starter, but given his skills, it’s a narrow one. He lacks the short-area quickness and strength to be a creator in the NFL, and will have to rely instead on his smarts, feel in the pocket and the tempo and timing of a traditional dropback passing game. In college, he struggled to play with pro rhythm, thanks largely to the structure of Colorado’s offense and woeful offensive line. Brand Sanders billed Shedeur as a dynamic, creative quarterback, blessed with the kind of football smarts that come from being the son of a Hall of Famer and a coach. The latter is true; Sanders throws with outstanding touch and anticipation when given time. But the player he will be asked to be in the pros is not the player he was in college. That, as much as anything, is why teams balked at making a first-round investment.Landing in the second round may ultimately be good for Sanders’s career. His ego may be bruised, but the destination will be more important than the slot he was selected in.NFL 2025 first-round picks1) Tennessee Titans,Cam Ward, QB, Miami2) Jacksonville Jaguars,Travis Hunter, WR/CB, Colorado(from Browns)3) New York Giants,Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State4) New England Patriots,Will Campbell, OT, LSU5) Cleveland Browns,Mason Graham, DT, Michigan(from Jaguars)6) Las Vegas Raiders,Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State7) New York Jets,Armand Membou, OT, Missouri8) Carolina Panthers,Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona9) New Orleans Saints,Kelvin Banks Jr, OT, Texas10) Chicago Bears,Colston Loveland, TE, Michigan11) San Francisco 49ers,Mykel Williams, Edge, Georgia12) Dallas Cowboys,Tyler Booker, OG, Alabama13) Miami Dolphins,Kenneth Grant, DT, Michigan14) Indianapolis Colts,Tyler Warren, TE, Penn State15) Atlanta Falcons,Jalon Walker, LB, Alabama16) Arizona Cardinals,Walter Nolen, DT, Mississippi17) Cincinnati Bengals,Shemar Stewart, edge, Texas A&M18) Seattle Seahawks,Grey Zabel, OG, North Dakota State19) Tampa Bay Buccaneers,Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State20) Denver Broncos,Jahdae Barron, CB, Texas21) Pittsburgh Steelers,Derrick Harmon, DT, Oregon22) Los Angeles Chargers,Omarion Hampton, RB, North Carolina23) Green Bay Packers,Matthew Golden, WR, Texas24) Minnesota Vikings,Donovan Jackson, OG, Ohio State25) New York Giants,Jaxson Dart, QB, Ole Miss(from Texans)26) Atlanta Falcons,James Pearce Jr, edge, Tennessee(from Rams)27) Baltimore Ravens,Malaki Starks, S, Georgia28) Detroit Lions,Tyleik Williams, DT, Ohio State29) Washington Commanders,Josh Conerly Jr, Oregon30) Buffalo Bills,Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky31) Philadelphia Eagles,Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama(from Chiefs)32) Kansas City Chiefs,Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio State(from Eagles)Explore more on these topicsNFLJacksonville JaguarsCleveland BrownsUS sportsanalysisShareReuse this content"

He also said her response to her health issues helped motivate him.“After all those brain surgeries, man, she did not give up,” Harmon said. “She still took me to practice, still went to work, and I always, always, in the back of my head from the beginning of my college career was, why can’t I keep going?

He was taken to a local hospital and placed into a induced coma. His family said he is now out of the coma but remains intubated. The family said he has “shown significant signs of progress within the last 24 hours.” He had asked if anyone else was hurt in the crash after he woke.TMZ published videoof the aftermath of the crash, showing the Cybertruck on fire.The Los Angeles Times quoted a police sourcesaying that drugs or alcohol are not thought to have played a role in the crash.The family also published a quote from a bystander who helped rescue Arenas from the truck.“I remember hearing banging on the car window, but I couldn’t see anything because the smoke was so thick. That’s when I realized someone was inside,” the person said. “I tried to break the window, but it wouldn’t give. Then I saw one of the windows was cracked just enough and we used everything we had to bend it and pull him out. The car was on fire. We just knew we had to get him out.”The family praised the person who saved Arenas, as well as the medical staff who are caring for him.“This act of courage, along with Alijah’s incredible will to survive, has been nothing short of miraculous,” the family said. “The family continues to ask for the public’s prayers and support as their miracle baby fights his way back to a full recovery. They remain deeply grateful for the exceptional care provided by his medical team and the overwhelming love and encouragement from the community.”Arenas has committed to play basketball at USC, and is considered one of the best prospects of the class of 2025. The 6ft 6in guard was watched by his father Gilbert at the McDonald’s All-American Game in April.In a statement on Thursday, USC coach Eric Musselman addressed the crash. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Alijah and his family following this morning’s accident. Please keep him, his teammates and friends, and the entire Arenas family in your prayers.”Alijah Arenas is one of four children Gilbert Arenas had with his former partner, Laura Govan. Alijah’s sister Izelarecently transferred to play at Kansas State. Gilbert Arenas played 12 seasons in the NBA from 2001-2012. He was a three-time All-Star and was named the league’s most improved player in 2003.Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBACollege basketballCollege sportsLos AngelesWest CoastUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It came on the streets of Barcelona, where the 24-year-old Ugandan covered 13.1 miles in 56min 42sec – a half marathon time 48 seconds quicker than anyone else in history.Little more than two months later, Kiplimo is in London for his full marathon debut and the noise has only grown louder. Could he break the world record on Sunday? Could he even become the first man to break two hours in an official race? It is speculation that the event director, Hugh Brasher, is more than happy to stoke.“I think it’s going to be the most fascinating debut ever,” he says. “Is it feasible that he could take Kelvin Kiptum’s record as the fastest debutant? Without a doubt. Do I think he could one day be the athlete that runs under two hours? Yes. But let’s see what happens on Sunday.”‘It’s a step towards hope’: a refugee’s journey from wartorn Eritrea to the London MarathonRead moreKiplimo was regarded as a superstar in waiting even before he competed over 5,000m as a 15-year-old prodigy at the 2016 Rio Olympics. He had a humble upbringing on a farm in Kween, 1,500m above sea level on the Mount Elgon volcano. But, because his father had three wives, he had many older half-brothers to run with – including Robert Chemonges and Victor Kiplangat, both of whom have gone on to be sub 2hr 10min marathoners – and soon proved to be something special.“We were helping our brothers, the big brothers,” he says. “They were running and we kept seeing them when they were training. And one day, I tell them: ‘I want to become like you.’ So I just kept training, training. This was when I was around 10 or 11.”A few years later Kiplimo was spotted and brought to Italy to train for the 2016 Olympics. “Afterwards my coach, Giuseppe Giambrone, said to me: ‘You will be one of the greatest runners in the world,’” says Kiplimo. “It ended in the semi-finals. But it was a huge experience for me to be at the Olympics.”Kiplimo’s staggering performances as a 15-year-old included running the 5,000m in 13min 19.54sec and the 10,000m in 27:26.28 – all in the era before supershoes. But despite going on to win two senior world cross country titles as well as Olympic and world 10,000m bronze medals, his lack of a devastating sprint finish ended up hurting him on the track.On the roads it has so far been a different story. But on Sunday he faces the moment of truth against one of the greatestLondon Marathonfields ever assembled. It includes Eliud Kipchoge, the greatest of all time, the Olympic champion Tamirat Tola, last year’s winner Alexander Mutiso and the well-fancied Sabastian Sawe, a late bloomer at 30 who ran 2:02.05 to win the Valencia Marathon in December, the second-fastest debut in history. British eyes, meanwhile, will also be focused on Olympic triathlon gold medallist Alex Yee, who hopes to run around 2:09 in his debut over 26.2 miles.“I am ready to compete,” says Kiplimo, who reveals that he feels much stronger having gone from running around 75-90 miles a week during his track career to more like 125-135 for the marathon.View image in fullscreenJacob Kiplimo in action at the world cross country championships in 2024.Photograph: Đorđe Kojadinović/ReutersThe leading pack is likely to go through halfway in 61 minutes, giving scope for Kiplimo to run a negative split and chase down Kiptum’s world record of 2:00.35. A following wind for the second half of the race will help, although the forecast may be a little warm.When asked whether he could one day break two hours for the marathon, Kiplimo is cautious – at least for now. “Yes, of course,” he says. “Maybe in the future. But I’m just focusing on my debut. If this one goes well, then maybe I will be the guy to make it.”Inevitably, Kiplimo’s record-breaking times have aroused some suspicion – especially given the number of east Africans who have been caught doping over the past decade. In online forums, it is also noted that his agents, Rosa and Associati, have had previous clients test positive for EPO – including the 2016 Olympic marathon champion, Jemima Sumgong, and Rita Jeptoo, who won twice in Boston.Those cases led toFrederico Rosa being investigated by the Kenyan governmentin 2016, before all charges were dropped. Afterwards, Rosa’s lawyer insisted that the government did “not have an iota of evidence against my client” and Kiplimo promises that he and his team can be trusted.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They tell us, in case of anything, you have to write everything down that you are taking. Some athletes want shortcuts. But for us we keep following the programme.”“Can we trust you and believe in you?” he is asked.“Yes, of course,” comes the reply.“A man that has run 56.42 for a half marathon?”“Yes, of course.”Kiplimo’s answers were as emphatic as he hopes his performance will be on Sunday. He is particularly excited to face Kipchoge, who he helped pace to a sub two-hour marathon in Vienna in 2019, albeit in a race which didn’t qualify for a world record under WorldAthleticsrules.“I remember 2019, when I was pacing Kipchoge,” he says. “So for me it is a little bit amazing to compete with one of the greatest runners in history.” And, he hopes, to make some more history of his own.Explore more on these topicsLondon MarathonAthleticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A statement from Madrid finally confirmed that they would play after 10pm on Friday night, just 24 hours before kick-off.A previous statement from Madrid had demanded that the Spanish football federation (RFEF) take action after comments made by the referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea in the buildup to the game. That came after Madrid had refused to show up for the pre-match press conference, training session or the managers’ photocall at the Cartuja Stadium in Seville. Amid reports from media close to the club that they were contemplating refusing to play the match, Madrid finally confirmed their participation late on Friday night.“Faced by the rumours that have emerged in the last few hours,Real Madridwish to communicate that our team has never proposed renouncing playing in tomorrow’s final,” the statement said. “Our club understands that the unfortunate and inappropriate declarations made by the referees assigned to this game, made 24 hours before the final, cannot stain a sporting event of global significance which millions of people will watch.”Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The statement said that Madrid were acting “out of respect to all those fans who have travelled to Seville and those that are already in the Andalucían capital,” concluding that “the values of football should prevail, despite the hostility and animosity of that has today once again been made clear against our club, by the referees assigned to the final.”The statement finally brought to an end a long evening of uncertainty. Carlo Ancelotti and Luka Modric were scheduled to speak to the media at 7.15pm local time in Seville but, with the media waiting for them, they did not show.There was no announcement at the time and Madrid did not directly explain the decision later. Nor did they admit to asking the RFEF to remove De Burgos Bengoetxea or the VAR official Pablo González Fuertes. But a statement released an hour later described the referees’ remarks as “premeditated”, using a “threatening tone” and demonstrating a “manifest hostility” towards Real Madrid.The club accused the referees of “announcing supposed actions which are far from the principles of equality, objectivity and impartiality which should prevail a few hours before a footballing event followed by millions of people around the world”.Had Madrid not shown up, they would have faced a year-long ban from the competition and a fine of between €3,000 and €12,000. Eleven years they have waited for aclasicofinal and when at last it came, it was the referee in the spotlight when it fell upon Seville.Madrid had been angered by a pre-match press conference in which De Burgos Bengoetxea and González Fuertes talked about the club’s repeated criticism of referees on their TV channel. Pushed centre stage and exposed, made protagonists of the preview, both men appeared to have come with a message to deliver 24 hours before the game. Asked about the pressure they are under, especially from Real Madrid TV, González Fuertes warned of the impact on young officials, and said that stronger actions had to be taken.De Burgos Bengoetxea meanwhile was close to tears as he recounted the impact it has on his children. “When a child goes to school and people tell him his father is a thief it’s messed up,” the official said, his voice breaking. “All I can do is educate my son so that he knows that his father is honourable, show him what refereeing is, and for everyone to reflect on where we want to go; I would like you all to know, it is very hard.”View image in fullscreenReal Madrid remonstrate with referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea in 2023.Photograph: Jose Breton/APGonzález Fuertes said said: “More than what is said [in the videos], it’s the consequences of what is said. We see anonymous people on social media insulting and threatening referees without any control, those responsible for clubs’ social media continuously attacking us. The consequences of talking about robberies and using bad words, that frustration you create among fans, is something that the boys and girls who pick up a whistle to do a kids’ game end up paying for. That is the consequence of putting a target on a colleague’s head. We’re not going to allow it to keep happening.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Barcelona’s press conferences were at 5.15pm, during which Hansi Flick had said: “We need the referees.” Madrid were due to appear two hours later. But, as they had done with the Ballon d’Or ceremony in October,they did not show up, cancelling everything. There would be no press conference, no training session and no handshake between the coaches, accompanied by the trophy. The president, Florentino Pérez, had already decided not to attend any of the institutional events.The RFEF subsequently confirmed that Madrid had told them that they would not be participating in any pre-match activities.Madrid wanted the Federation to remove De Burgos Bengoetxea from refereeing duties, considering his position untenable following the press conference and what they saw as a conflict of interests. But they did not directly or publicly demand for that to happen and the first of their two subsequent statements stopped short of repeating that threat openly. Instead, their position had been expressed through the media close to the club hierarchy, which also leaked the possibility of them not turning up for the match.“Real Madrid CF considers the public statements made today by the referees appointed for the Copa del Rey final to be unacceptable,” the club said in a statement. “These remarks made in a premeditated manner, 24 hours before [kick-off and] against one of the participants in the final demonstrate, once again, a clear and manifest animosity and hostility against Real Madrid.“Given the seriousness of what happened, Real Madrid expects the RFEF and the refereeing establishment to act accordingly, adopting the relevant measures in defence of the institutions that they represent.”The RFEF insisted that it would not change the referees and that it expected the game to go ahead but conversations continued and the wait for confirmation went on into the evening until Madrid announced that they had never contemplated boycotting. Ancelotti was not in the press room at La Cartuja at 7.15pm local time, but his team will be out on the pitch at 10pm on Saturday night.Explore more on these topicsCopa del ReyReal MadridBarcelonaLa LigaEuropean club footballRefereesnewsShareReuse this content"

Sometimes he tells his squad the lineup the day before a game, on other occasions half an hour before they depart the team hotel for the stadium on a match day. Training tends to offer some clues but of late there have been surprises. Emery, a hugely emotional character, has been known to make impulsive, snap calls. Morgan Rogers, a rare mainstay and one of Villa’s trio of undroppables, recently described how his manager’s decision‑making can feel like flip‑of-the-coin stuff.When the teamsheets are released an hour before kick-off at Wembley on Saturday, the eyeballs will jump towards the most intriguing selection dilemma: will Emery favourMarcus Rashfordor Ollie Watkins?Premier League and FA Cup semis: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreRashford, who lifted the FA Cup with Manchester United last season, has started seven of Villa’s past nine matches, scoring four goals. Watkins has begun three games across the same period, scoring twice, including the opening goalin the victory against Newcastleto move him level with Gabriel Agbonlahor on a record 74 Premier League goals for Villa. Emery has suggested he wants to experiment further with pairing Rashford and Watkins in attack, though he has not done so since Villa progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League withvictory against Club Bruggesix weeks ago.For Rashford, another start against Crystal Palace would be another big tick. His performance against Paris Saint-Germain at Villa Park, when he kickstartedthe comeback that put PSG on the ropesand almost fuelled one of the great European shocks, was undoubtedly his best showing in a Villa shirt. There was the dart inside Willian Pacho and Marquinhos before he sprung a stinging right-foot shot at Gianluigi Donnarumma. He was involved in the intricate move that led to Villa’s first goal, scored by Youri Tielemans, but the moment when he pressed pause, zipped the ball past Fabián Ruiz and skipped past Vitinha before teeing up Ezri Konsa to strike was a flashback to yesteryear. There were more glimpses of that menace on Tuesday at the Etihad Stadium, where he rattled a post inside 17 seconds and converted a cool penalty to add to his scoring record against Manchester City.View image in fullscreenMarcus Rashford put in his finest performance yet in an Aston Villa shirt against PSG.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersPerhaps it should be no surprise Rashford’s impact has been gradual. When he arrived at Villa in February he was lacking match fitness having started two United matches in the previous two months. All parties recognised it was pointless putting him in at the deep end. The 27-year-old requested to train on his first days off and last month pitched up at the local Midland League Division One side Sutton United for an individual session with the coach Jamie Reynolds. But after easing him in as planned, Emery has been impressed. “I am so, so happy with him,” Emery said. “He’s performing very well. Keep going – now Saturday, hopefully, he can help us again.”Emery has spoken about the smile that has returned to Rashford’s face at Villa. The pair are thought to have developed a good relationship and the forward was enthused about working with Emery after a friend and fellow player suggested the Spaniard was in the same bracket as Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger as an elite manager.Rashford, who gets on well with Konsa, Jacob Ramsey and Tyrone Mings, is thought to be living between Birmingham and his Cheshire base.After the slew of winter-window arrivals, Emery held a team meeting in which he outlined the state of play in various competitions, with Villa still fighting on three fronts at the time. Rashford was the headline arrival, even with Marco Asensio coming on loan from PSG. Axel Disasi signed from Chelsea, and Donyell Malen and Andrés García joined permanently. The other thing Emery made clear was that because there was more depth to the squad, rotation was inevitable given the weight of games and players could not afford to become demoralised.“If you’re not starting, we’ve not got time to care about it, in the sense that we’ve got places we want to get to,” Rogers said, explaining the message. Watkins has responded in the best way, impressing in a particularly dominant first-half displayagainst Nottingham Forestand scoring inside a minute on his last start, against Newcastle.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Tielemans, who scored a screamer to help Leicester win the Cup in 2021, has started 50 of Villa’s 52 matches, including every Premier League match, having been given the night off only in the early rounds of the Carabao Cup, against Wycombe and Palace. Emiliano Martínez and Rogers are not far behind with 48 starts. The 53rd game of the season could end with Villa in a firstFA Cupfinal since 2015.It remains to be seen whether the club intend to trigger the £40m option to sign Rashford, who has three years on his £375,000-a-week contract at United. For United, the Rashford conundrum has been Villa’s gain.His first goals came against Preston in the Cup quarter-finals, the first a simple finish, the other from the penalty spot. He has been in favour since. Rashford, who started both of England’s victories at Wembley in March, propelled Villa into a place of wonder against PSG.

Hearn, who promotes Benn, spoke of “a fight for the generations … an iconic main event … an incredible time for boxing” and urged us to “remember this night … this is what it’s all about.”Eubank Jris 35 years old and he has often campaigned as a super-middleweight at 168lb, which is 21lb heavier than the welterweight category in which Benn has mostly fought. He and Benn will now bridge the size-gap and meet as middleweights, but, on Friday morning, at the official weigh-in behind closed doors, Eubank Jr failed twice to make the 160 pound mark. While his second attempt was just 0.05lb (0.8 ounces) heavier than the contracted weight, Eubank Jr has been fined £375,000.He also faces a further test. Eubank Jr has to weigh in again on the morning of the fight and cannot scale more than an additional 10lb.Chris Eubank Jr silences Eddie Hearn and pledges to ‘take out’ Conor BennRead moreAfter a hard weight-cut, Eubank Jr could normally add at least 15lb before stepping into the ring the following night. But the rehydration clause, which compromises his recovery and allows the fight to gain a worrying edge, has been condemned in some quarters.Peter Hamlyn,the neurosurgeon who has saved the lives of multiple boxers, if not all from the harm of brain damage, has spoken of the risk and irresponsibility. Chris Eubank Sr haspleaded for the fight to be stopped. He has also cut ties with his son because of the weight stipulation and the fact that Junior’s antics have matched Benn’s spiteful insults.They were first meant to fight in October 2022 – but that contest was cancelled after Benn returnedtwo separate positive drug test results. Since then controversy and scandal have held sway. Benn has spent the intervening period ranting at the injustice he feels he has suffered while refusing to share the “scientific proof” which he insists clears him of intentional wrongdoing. He has also railed against Eubank Jr who has goaded him as “a cheat” andsplattered an egg against his face. Saturday will be Benn’s first UK fight in three years after the National Anti-Doping Panel concluded it was not satisfied an anti-doping violation had been proven and lifted a suspension last November.But the hard sell of an unpalatable fight has not caught fire yet. Even the heavy-handed Fatal Fury name given to the bout has been loaned from a promotionally linked gaming series that is far more popular than the battered old business of boxing. In a curiously flat fight week the commercial success might not be as clear-cut as has been previously suggested.The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is apparently sold out but this week it has been possible to buy fight tickets for as little as £24 on websites which can charge exorbitant prices for sporting events. At the same time the promoters have been giving away plenty of freebies, in the form of online competitions, as there are apparently enough spares that were not snapped up by the paying public. This might be canny marketing but it seems strange that a heavily hyped fight, meant to generate widespread interest outside hardcore boxing circles, should have so many tickets floating around.However, the rehydration restrictions and bitter arguments have lent a layer of intrigue as to what might happen when Eubank Jr and Benn are alone in the ring. Most boxing insiders have long believed that Eubank Jr should win clearly. He might fall just short of true world-class pedigree but he is the bigger man, with so much more experience than Benn.But over the past few days there has been a sudden swing of guesswork that the 28-year-old Benn could prevail against the odds. Whenever so many seasoned judges change their minds it’s worth pausing. The late backing of Benn seems to be based on gossip from sparring sessions, with Eubank Jr supposedly looking poor while Benn has apparently lit up the ring behind closed doors, and the abrupt realisation that age and weight might have humbled the favourite.View image in fullscreenConor Benn has been sparring impressively, according to some inside reports.Photograph: Mark Robinson/Matchroom BoxingEubank Jr has lost three times in 37 fights and those defeats have been to domestic rivals – Billy Joe Saunders, George Groves and Liam Smith. The last, in January 2023, was the most shocking. Eubank Jr’s iron jaw resembles his father’s but, against Smith, he was knocked down twice before the fight waswaved over in round four. It looked as if an ageing fighter was nearing the end of a bleak road.But Eubank Jrdominated the rematch nine months later. It emerged that Smith had various problems but, impressively, Eubank forced a 10th-round stoppage.Since then he has fought only once – a routine technical knockout of the Polish boxer, Kamil Szeremeta, in Riyadh. It meant that Eubank Jr had forced 10 knockdowns in his last three wins without resembling a devastating puncher. That anomaly might be another sign that age has drained Eubank Jr of his natural power.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These were his last fights before he tested positive for clomifene, with the two separate results being recorded months apart.While he struggled to clear his name Benn staged an unconvincing comeback in America and won a couple of laboured decisions against the obscure Rodolfo Orozco and Peter Dobson. Now, it is claimed, he looks brilliant in the gym. He also appears much bigger and carries a burning intensity to hurt the man who has taunted him for so long.This injects some drama into the occasion but it should not be forgotten that we are watching two local rivals whose careers have battled to rise above decent competence. Those banging the drum have tried to make this sound like a British equivalent of the epic world middleweight fight between Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns which scorched the ring 40 years ago this month. But these fisticuffs are humdrum and even embarrassing in comparison.Chris Eubank Jr: ‘I shouldn’t be doing this. But we are the daredevils of sport’Read moreBoxing was once covered by great writers and social commentators. It is now a marginalised sport where its humble hacks are denied access to the fighters while they wait to hear if they will be granted accreditation. Those credentials can be withdrawn following criticism of Saudi Arabia or boxing’s power-brokers. The optics look petty when one of the world’s most visited and respected fight websites,BoxingScene, has been denied accreditation for the past four major events to which it has submitted applications, including this week in Tottenham. Some highly credible writers and editors are being shut out of boxing.It is also timely to remember how the promoters and many of the undercard fighters on Thursday thanked Turki al-Sheikh for brokering the bout. Sheikh heads the General Entertainment Authority which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars securing Saudi Arabia’s takeover of elite boxing.Twelve hours after Sheikh’s name was celebrated,the Athletic publisheda sobering six-month investigation into the reputation of the man revered in boxing as His Excellency. The allegations are serious, and apparently well-sourced. Sheikh did not respond to the claims made against him in the investigation.It is likely that boxing will fall silent in regard to this issue once the sound and fury, signifying nothing, fade after Eubank Jr and Benn leave the ring. It fits the desolate pattern of today’s fight business but, hey, as we keep being reminded, this is “an incredible time for boxing.”Explore more on these topicsBoxingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Grizzlies led by 26 at half-time.Morant was later seen on crutches in the tunnel with what was described as a left hip contusion. Grizzlies interim coach Tuomas Iisalo said he was unsure if the two-time All Star would be available for Saturday’s game.“He’s going through further evaluations tomorrow,” said Iisalo. “Then we’ll know more.”Asked how much his absence affected the Grizzlies play in the second half, Iisalo replied: “I would say quite drastically from the end result. But not only the energy, but also the execution.”The 29-point comeback was the second-largest in anNBApostseason game since play-by-play data began being recorded in the 1996-97 season. The only one bigger: A comeback from 31 points down by the Los Angeles Clippers against Golden State in April 2019.The top-seeded Thunder, who won Game 1 131-80 in the fifth-biggest margin of victory in NBA postseason history, didn’t even have a lead in this one until the fourth quarter. Now, they can close out the series on Saturday.“I just through out of half-time, we kind of reconnected to who we are. We were very out of character in the first half,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 31 points for Oklahoma City and Jalen Williams added 26, splitting a pair of free throws with 1:20 left to give the Thunder their first lead. Scotty Pippen scored 28 points, two short of his career high, to lead Memphis. Jaren Jackson Jr added 22 points as Memphis saw their lead evaporate in the second half.“They built a 29-point lead in a half, so we felt like all we had to do was build our own 29-point lead,” Gilgeous-Alexander said.In Thursday’s other games, Kawhi Leonard scored 21 points and the Los Angeles Clippers rolled to a 117-83 victory over Nikola Jokić and the Denver Nuggets to take a 2-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.Meanwhile, the New York Knicks left no doubt about their plan for Game 3 in the opening minutes against the Detroit Pistons. Karl-Anthony Towns took his team’s first shot, made his first of four three-pointers and scored five points in the opening minutes to start an 11-point quarter. Towns scored 31 points, grabbed eight rebounds and blocked two shots to lead New York in a 118-116 victory over the Detroit Pistons to take a 2-1 lead in the first-round series. Game 4 is on Sunday in Detroit before the series shifts back to New York.Explore more on these topicsNBAOklahoma City ThunderMemphis GrizzliesBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach admits his team have “a big responsibility” to deliver at Anfield given the club’s last Premier League triumph, in 2020, came behind closed doors during the Covid pandemic. Slot’s family will be in attendance, although he says their visit was planned months ago to coincide with a public holiday in the Netherlands.Liverpool have dominated the Premier League season, never relinquishing first place after returning to the top on 2 November and embarking on a 26-game unbeaten run that rendered a title race obsolete. Yet Slot insists they have resembled his ideal team only occasionally, and that they must and will improve next season.Premier League and FA Cup semis: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead more“Every manager around the world wants to achieve perfection and that will probably never work out,” Slot said. “But even in the last few weeks we are still trying to get better in certain things and keeping the standards as high as we had them for the whole season. Maybe in some parts of the season or in phases of some games we were quite close [to his vision of what a Slot team should be] but in other moments we have to do much better. We can definitely improve.“In general every manager that works at a top club wants to have control of a game, every single minute of the game, but that is hardly possible in this league. There were phases also during the season or during games where we didn’t have that control, so I think we have to become even better … The positive thing from us this season is that we never went down a lot, even if we didn’t have the control I would like. We were still difficult to score against but a bit more ball possession and threatening the opponent even more would be good.”Slot, grounded as ever, insists he has not contemplated what it would mean to win the title in his first season at Liverpool, his place in Anfield folklore or what the celebrations could be like on Sunday. Asked whether he was aware that he was an inch from becoming a Liverpool legend, the 46-year-old replied: “Yes, but I prefer to get my mind on that inch and not on what happens afterwards because there is still an inch to be done.”He said: “We have to do the job. But of course it gives us a lot of confidence the way we have played all the way through the season in sometimes difficult circumstances as well. We’ve always shown up, not only us but the fans as well. I have all the confidence we will show up again, but I also know how unpredictable a game of football can be. That’s why we have to be so well prepared.”Slot is acutely aware of what it will mean to the supporters to win the league, even though opportunities to interact are rare. “Sometimes when I’m driving on the motorway they come up right next to you for 500m or a kilometre and [punches the air],” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the club’s first FA Cup semi-final appearance, under the maverick former Manchester City manager, when they were in the old Third Division.Allison had already changed Palace’s nickname from the Glaziers to the Eagles and their colours to red and blue within a few months of his arrival from City in March 1973. It was after their third-round victory over non-league Scarborough that he decided to keep wearing the lucky hat that had bizarrely been inspired by the “spats” – fabric shoe covers – worn by Portsmouth’s 1939 Cup-winning manager, Jack Tinn.Eze fires Crystal Palace to emphatic win over Fulham and into FA Cup semisRead more“When Jack was asked why he wore them, he said: ‘We’re going to win the Cup with these spats,’” Allison said. “I think they were 40-1 in the betting and they went and won it. So I thought: ‘Well, nobody can really see spats, so I’m going to wear the fedora.’ As I was going past the Scarborough dressing room, all their players were in the bath and I could hear them saying: ‘What do you think about that big-headed bastard? First chance we ever have of getting some publicity and he comes along in that stupid hat.’”Palace went on to win at Leeds, Chelsea and Sunderland – all in higher divisions – before losing to the eventual winners, Southampton, in the last four. They missed out on promotion that season and Allison, who would later inspire a certain José Mourinho while in charge of the Portuguese side Vitória Setúbal during a managerial career that encompassed five countries, left to join Galatasaray. But his assistant, Terry Venables, went on to guide them to the top flight for only the second time in their history within three seasons.The club’s firstFA Cupfinal came in 1990 under Steve Coppell after a thrilling victory over the eventual league champions, Liverpool, in the semi-final at Villa Park and they finished third the following year in Division One. Palace also reached both domestic cup semi-finals under Alan Smith in 1995. But as they complete a club-record 12th consecutive season in the top division it is hard to argue against the notion that this is the most successful era of their existence.View image in fullscreenThe charismatic Crystal Palace manager Malcolm Allison in his fedora.Photograph: Central Press/Getty ImagesA third Cup semi-final in 10 seasons suggests Palace are getting closer to the holy grail of a first major trophy after the bitter disappointment of twice losing to Manchester United in the final.The 2016 defeatis remembered for Alan Pardew’s infamous dance after Jason Puncheon gave Palace the lead. In the 2022semi-final against Chelsea, Patrick Vieira’s side – missing the loanee Conor Gallagher – failed to show up.Palace’s evolution under Oliver Glasner feels different. After Wednesday’sbattling draw at Arsenal, they need five points from their last four games to record their highest Premier League tally and are in contention to finish above 10th for the first time. They have a squad stacked with internationals. Eberechi Eze’s goal against Latvia in March made him the first Palace player to score for England since Peter Taylor in 1976.Taylor was sold to Spurs a few months after Palace’s Cup run under Allison and the vultures have continued to circle Selhurst Park. The captain, Marc Guéhi, has only a year on his contract and is likely to leave in the summer, and Eze, Jean-Philippe Mateta – the top scorer – and the midfield conductor Adam Wharton are also wanted by bigger clubs. This team likely have one opportunity to make history and Glasner – who has yet to commit his future beyond next season amid reported interest from the Premier League and Bundesliga – is determined to seize it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the next five weeks, this is what we’ll go for.”In terms of personality, Glasner and the often-controversial Allison could not be further apart. The softly spoken 50-year-old Glasner grew up in rural Austria and his only previous trip to Wembley was for a Taylor Swift concert with his daughter Alina. But after winning the Austrian Cup twice as a player with his boyhood club SV Ried beforeleading Eintracht Frankfurtto their Europa League triumph in 2022 and the German Cup final 12 months later, Glasner is hoping to bring silverware to south London. He will wear a suit if Palace reach the final.“I like this tradition,” he said. “I went to the tennis at Wimbledon and then you have to wear a jacket and tie. It was a Thursday evening and I’ve never worn a jacket and tie on a Thursday evening. But it was a special atmosphere. If we get there, I will stick to the tradition.”View image in fullscreenAlan Pardew does his dance to the camera after Jason Puncheon scored for Crystal Palace against Manchester United in the 2016 FA Cup final.Photograph: BBC SportMore than £13,000 has been raised by the Palace supporters’ group the Holmesdale Fanatics for a tifo at Wembley thanks to donations from several first-team players, including the goalkeeper Dean Henderson and the defender Chris Richards. The end of Roy Hodgson’s second spell as manager was tainted by criticism from the supporters about the club’s lack of direction, with a banner during a 5-0 defeat by Arsenal in January last year complaining of “wasted potential on and off the pitch. Weak decisions taking us backwards.”A civil war between the chairman, Steve Parish, and John Textor, Palace’s biggest shareholder, who has designs on taking over the club despite threatening to sell his 45% stake for the past year, has yet to be resolved.Meanwhile, they are seeking extra funding for a new Main Stand that was planned to be completed by 2021 and is expected to cost more than £200m. Winning the FA Cup final and qualifying for a first European campaign – other than two games in the 1998 Intertoto Cup after Palace had been relegated – would certainly help to boost the coffers.“I was told the relationship [with the supporters] before [I arrived] was not on the top level, but since then I could feel the support for the team,” Glasner said. “Tomorrow I will get butterflies and be a little bit nervous. When you get up, it’s a little bit of tension. But when the referee starts the game, let it run, let it flow, and then it’s just football.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceFA CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For starters, their opponents, Barcelona, have never lost a two-leg Women’s Champions League tie after securing a first-leg victory. They have won 17 consecutive two-leg ties in the tournament and, this time, the eight-time semi-finalists are three goals ahead.For Chelsea to knock them out from4-1 downwill require something out of the ordinary; historic in fact. Since Europe’s elite women’s club competition was rebranded to be known as the Women’s Champions League in 2009-10, no team have overturned a three-goal deficit to progress on aggregate.Barcelona show gulf in quality again as stunned Chelsea hope for miracle | Sophie DowneyRead moreThe men’s edition has delivered a string of unforgettable comebacks, from a 95th-minute Sergi Roberto goal completingBarcelona’s 6-5 aggregate win over Paris Saint-Germainin 2017, and acorner taken quickly by Trent Alexander Arnold at Anfield, toRoma rising from their ruins to eliminate Barcelonaon away goals in 2018.In the Women’s Champions League, the closest to a three-goal deficit being overturned was a last-32 tie between Glasgow City and BIIK Kazygurt of Kazakhstan, when the Scottish club won the second leg 4-1 to level at 4-4 on aggregate but were eliminated on away goals. To make matters worse for Chelsea, the away goals rule is no longer in operation, somewhat lessening the value of Sandy Baltimore’s strike in last Sunday’s first leg.Those three examples of men’s game comebacks involved Barcelona but their women’s side are not used to such rollercoasters; they have not lost a match by a three-goal margin or more since the 2019 European final whenbeaten 4-1 by a Lyon sidethat included the England right-back Lucy Bronze, who will line up for Chelsea against her old side on Sunday hoping to reproduce such a performance.View image in fullscreenClàudia Pina scored twice and helped Barcelona to take a resounding lead into the second leg.Photograph: Alex Canales/SPP/ShutterstockA three-goal win would merely force extra time. The last time Barcelona lost a game by a four-goal margin or more was in the autumn of 2012 when Arsenal were 4-0 winners in the second leg of a 7-0 aggregate victory. It was a night when the Scotland defender Jen Beattie scored a hat-trick. Yes, you read that correctly: a Beattie treble against Barça. How times change. That was a Barcelona side unrecognisable from the one trying to defend their Champions League title. Only Alexia Putellas, then 18, remains in the team.Barcelona are trying to reach their fifth consecutive final and have won seven of their past 10 matches against English sides. To offer Chelsea fans a glimmer of hope, it should not be forgotten that their club were responsible for surely the joint-greatest comeback in Women’s Champions League history, when they battled back from atwo-goal first-leg deficitto beatManchester City 3-2 on aggregatein this season’s quarter-finals, 24 hoursafter Arsenal had done the sameagainst Real Madrid, on a dramatic couple of March nights in London.That recovery showed what Chelsea are capable of at their best; three goals in the first half from Baltimore, Nathalie Björn and Mayra Ramírez came in a spell of intense pressure that City could not cope with.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is a 2pm BST kick-off, amid Uefa’s persistence with scheduling the women’s European semi-finals on weekends, despite the clashes with a seemingly endless list of other domestic action. Whether the Stamford Bridge crowd can stir up the atmosphere witnessed there on some electric nights under the floodlights at women’s games, such as knocking out the eight-time champions Lyon on penalties in 2023 and overpowering a sock-less Arsenal a year later remains to be seen. The hosts have sold about 25,000 tickets.If those hopeful Chelsea fans are not to go home disappointed, their team will need to show a huge improvement in possession from the first leg, when they touched the ball inside Barcelona’s box 12 times and completed just over half as many passes as their hosts. Second best in almost every department, they were unable to progress up the pitch with the confidence Women’s Super League viewers are used to seeing.Arousing speech by Bronze, issued to her teammates on the pitch at full-time at Estadi Johan Cruyff, delivered a message that Chelsea must not give up, that they must believe they can fight back. It would be wrong to write them off but the form guide suggests Barcelona are the least likely team on the planet to relinquish a 4-1 lead.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Champions LeagueChelsea WomenBarcelona WomenWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And yet the manager still believes they can break the cycle of frustration, leaning on the words of Jacob Riis, a journalist and social reformer in late 19th and early 20th century New York, to inspire his players.Postecoglou has endured a miserable Premier League season, losing 18 matches. He takes his team to Liverpool on Sunday admitting that some of his work has gone “disastrously wrong”. It is why he may not remain in his post beyond the end of the season even if he wins the Europa League. Spurs are into the semi-finals, where they take on Norwegian club Bodø/Glimt.Premier League and FA Cup semis: 10 things to look out for this weekendRead moreWhat has got to Postecoglou is his sense that all of the challenges he has faced have been overlooked – chiefly, how he has been asked to overhaul the squad, placing an emphasis on youth, and reimagine the playing style. In his first season, he led the team to a fifth-placed finish; an improvement on eighth from 2022-23.Postecoglou felt the achievement was poorly received. Spurs had been in pole position to finish fourth, which would have guaranteed a return to the Champions League, until they lost five of their final seven games, including the penultimate oneat home to Manchester City. Most of their fans had wanted them to lose that night to ensure Arsenal did not win the title. Fifth place will be enough for Champions League qualification this season. Spurs are 16th.“I love the frenzy around finishing fifth this year … they’re all brilliant, aren’t they?” Postecoglou said. “We finished fifth last year. Why is it such a disaster that we finished fifth? Around this time last year, I was asked to lose a game [against City]. And I was wrong for wanting to win it.“We finished fifth but it’s not a good story. A better story is my tenure has been a disaster and it continues to be. I just think that the kind of hysteria that is surrounding what’s happening at the moment is all premeditated for a certain outcome. Hopefully we can defy that.”Postecoglou said the Spurs fans he met were very supportive; he has never felt it was them against him. His impression, though, is that there is a tension between people and the club.“There is this narrative of trying to set this club up for some sort of fall – consistently,” Postecoglou said. “There is no allowance for any kind of building of foundations, for something a bit different than before.“The one thing you do know is what doesn’t work here. Yes, I’m trying to do things very, very differently. It hasn’t all worked out, some of it has gone disastrously wrong. I accept that. I said from the start: ‘We need to chart a different course if we are ever going to break the cycle this club has been in.’“But I think there is a narrative around that this club has been on some sort of downward spiral again or is going down the same rabbit hole that it has in the past. Whereas I think this is totally different and there has been very little acknowledgment of that.”View image in fullscreenSon Heung-min will miss the match at Liverpool because of his foot injury.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersPostecoglou has previously said that winning a first trophy for Spurs since 2008 would not change everything but he isnow all-in on Europa League glory. He brought up a quotation from Riis about the endeavours of a stonecutter and he clearly sees the parallels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s not. So time will tell … whether what I’ve tried to do over the last two years gets us to crack that stone.”If Postecoglou reaches the Europa League final, it would be his 100th game for Spurs – with one league match to follow before the end of the season. “You won’t know how much I’ve had an impact until we get to that place,” he said of the final. “We need to take the opportunity that’s before us and that won’t happen because we’re good for the next two to three weeks. That will only happen if what’s got us to this place gets us what we want.“What it [the Riis quotation] says is that if you keep doing the right thing, the impact it has is unseen. You won’t break it with the 101st blow unless you’ve done a lot of things which, to the naked eye, seem like you’re doing nothing or maybe the wrong thing. But the stonecutter knows you need to keep doing it because it’ll come.”When the manager cannot crack it at Spurs, it is invariably him who pays the price. But Postecoglou continued to brush off the swirl of speculation about his future. “If you asked any Tottenham supporter what’s the most important thing for them right now – who is going to be the manager next year or whether they win this thing [the Europa League] – 100% of them would say: ‘Just make sure we give ourselves the best opportunity to make some history,’” Postecoglou said. “The rest of it doesn’t matter. It will all take care of itself.”Postecoglou reported that Son Heung-min would not play at Liverpool as he recovers from a foot injury. The captain returned to training on the grass on Friday and will be monitored before Thursday’s first leg at home to Bodø/Glimt.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurAnge PostecoglounewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach, who insisted Cole Palmer’s goalscoring drought was all in the player’s head, also hinted at wanting to add more experience to his squad.Maresca, who will serve a touchline ban at Saturday’s home game against Everton, said Chelsea have the second-youngest squad in Europe and said he was often having to place his trust in teenagers when he makes substitutions. The club have adopted a policy of signing talented youngsters under the Todd Boehly-Clearlake Capital ownership and will prioritise deals for a centre-back, a winger and a striker this summer.Chelsea in pole position to sign Bournemouth’s Dean Huijsen in summerRead moreChelsea are sixth with five games left and Maresca acknowledged that financial regulations meant his budget may be dented if he fails to lead his side into the Champions League. “Football is not five, 10 years ago when the rules were different,” the head coach said. “Today you have to be careful how much you spend. It will be a completely different kind of target if we finish in the Champions League.”Chelsea continue to face questions over whether they have enough leaders. There have been claims that they looked into signing Virgil van Dijk before the 33-year-oldcommitted his future to Liverpool. Maresca considered whether he would be open to bringing in an older player this summer. “When you have experience you have something more, no doubt,” he said. “But the ones that struggle in terms of experience this year, they have already won more in terms of experience. Next year they can be better.”Chelsea would have at least briefly gone top if they had beaten Everton in December. Maresca was criticised for insisting at the time that they werenot title challengersbut he laughed off suggestions that his comments demonstrated a lack of ambition.The Italian, who said Christopher Nkunku was back in the squad after being dropped forlast week’s win over Fulham, was asked whether his team’s struggles since Christmas would harden them. “We are a better team today than two or three months ago because we went through this bad moment,” Maresca said. “And if you want to grow, you need this moment as a team.“We are the youngest team in the Premier League. And the second [youngest] in Europe. For some games, we have on the bench three or four players [born in] 2006, 2007 or 2008. Do you see that? No. I see that.”The discussion turned to Tyrique George after the 19-year-old winger came off the bench to equalise at Fulham. Maresca said Chelsea managers who worked for Roman Abramovich had the option of replacing star strikers with another experienced forward. “We trust Ty,” he said. “When [Didier] Drogba was here and the manager changed Drogba who was inside? Fernando Torres? Now we change Nico [Nicolas Jackson] with Ty from the academy. You see that? I see that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cole is the same one. The style of football we play is the same. The manager is the same. The club is the same. So nothing changes around Cole and Cole doesn’t change.

With a high turnover of players guaranteed this summer, and profitability and sustainability rules still affecting the club, Moyes said there was uncertainty over how TFG will navigate its first summer transfer window as Everton’s owner.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People have been brought in to do it before and it didn’t work [with Farhad Moshiri]. We need to hope that we can say: ‘This is how it should be going, this is what Everton are required to do and this is how we need to do it.’“I think this club is a little bit different at times to other clubs, I really do. It’s got a huge challenge against a club in the city with it, it’s got an incredible fanbase, but it also needs tender care and we don’t want it to go amiss.”Everton have 13 members of their first-team squad out of contract this summer, including loanees, and Moyes is aware it will be impossible to rebuild completely in one window. He knows who he wants to keep – “Yes, just about,” he said – but is waiting to discover how much the club can spend before finalising decisions on every player.Moyes, who celebrated his 62nd birthday on Friday, said: “Things don’t happen quickly here [in the English transfer market] but we will have to give decisions very quickly on players. A lot is dependent on, can we get Joe Bloggs to come and sign? That’s what we are waiting on and that’s the point we are at. We obviously will keep some players but others might be released. We’re trying to get a balance of that. It will be very hard to change this in one window. In fact, it will be impossible just about. If you’ve got 11 or 12 coming out of contract, that is too much.”Explore more on these topicsEvertonnewsShareReuse this content"

When we scored the first goal in October, November, December, January, we didn’t celebrate in the way of the [right] body language [of how] we celebrate.“That is a stupid detail but it says a lot about the passion we had all the time in this season – we didn’t have it. But we had 12-13 players [owing to injuries], we could not recover.

I think everyone has learned the lesson. We’ll compete in the Premier League a little bit better than what happened this season. But [an] FA Cup win will not give you the certainty of coming back to what we were. OK, we’ll be happy because we compete to win, but that will not change it.

When asked by the presenter Clare McDonnell whether Wright was an example of someone taking up space that could be occupied by a woman, Aluko said: “I’ve worked with Ian a long time and, you know, I think he’s a brilliant broadcaster. But I think he’s aware of just how much he’s doing in the women’s game. I think he should be aware of that.”Aluko added: “I think we need to be conscious and we need to make sure that women are not being blocked from having a pathway in broadcasting in the women’s game. It’s still new, it’s still growing. There’s a finite amount of opportunities and I think that men need to be aware of that. Men need to be aware that you’re in a growing sport for women and we haven’t always had these opportunities. It’s about the awareness and supporting other women through that pathway.”After media scrutiny of her comments, Aluko apologised to Wright on Friday. “Ian Wright is a brilliant broadcaster and role model whose support for the women’s game has been significant,” she wrote on Instagram.“In my interview with Woman’s Hour this week, I was trying to make a broader point about the limited opportunities for women in football – whether that’s in coaching, broadcasting or commercial spaces – and the importance of creating more space for women to thrive on and off the pitch. But it was wrong for Ian’s name to be raised in that conversation, and for that I sincerely apologise.“I’ve known and worked with Ian for many years and have nothing but love and respect for him.”On Thursday Aluko had posted on Instagram with a link to herBBCinterview to highlight the “full context” of her comments and deny she had “attacked” Wright.“I’m sharing this full episode here again so people can actually listen to everything I said with full context,” she wrote. “Contrary to clickbait media headlines no one was ‘attacked’ or ‘accused’ during this interview. There are lots of examples of men in women’s sport. Ian Wright is one. And as I said in the interview – Ian Wright is brilliant.”Wright was part of the BBC’s coverage of Euro 2022 when he implored, after England’s semi-final victory over Sweden, for girls to have the same access to football in schools as boys. His advocacy for the women’s game has stretched to paying for the anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation of Kayleigh McDonald, who sustained the injury while playing for Stoke City last year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In qualifying,Jackson Page earned a £147,000 chequefor hitting two 147s in the same match.Wakelin, who warmly congratulated his opponent on his achievement, was still in the driving seat at 10-3 ahead and took two of the session’s remaining three frames to lead 12-4.Quick GuideMaximum breaks at the CrucibleShow1983Cliff Thorburn (2nd round v Terry Griffiths, won 13-12)1992Jimmy White (1st round v Tony Drago, won 10-4)1995Stephen Hendry (Semi-final v Jimmy White, won 16-12)1997Ronnie O'Sullivan (1st round v Mick Price, won 10-6)2003Ronnie O'Sullivan (1st round v Marco Fu, lost 10-6)2005Mark Williams (1st round v Robert Milkins, won 10-1)2008Ronnie O'Sullivan (2nd round v Mark Williams, won 13-7)2008Ali Carter (Quarter-final v Peter Ebdon, won 13-9)2009Stephen Hendry (Quarter-final v Shaun Murphy, lost 13-11)2012Stephen Hendry (1st round v Stuart Bingham, won 10-4)2020John Higgins (2nd round v Kurt Maflin, lost 13-11)2022Neil Robertson (2nd round v Jack Lisowski, lost 13-12)2023Kyren Wilson (1st round v Ryan Day, won 10-5)2023Mark Selby (Final v Luca Brecel, lost 18-15)2025Mark Allen (2nd round v Chris Wakelin)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.In the evening Allen came out fighting and rattled off the first two frames. In the second he potted 11 reds and 10 blacks to give himself a chance of another 147 but ran out of position and missed a thin cut on the black. Wakelin took the next to complete his win.On the other table, the three-time world championMark Williamsand Iran’sHossein Vafaeiended a gruelling, three-hour first session level at 4-4. One fan who could be forgiven for getting distracted by news from the other table was Brian Nicholls. The 75-year-old won the session’s audience lottery, and knew he would win £25,000 if there was a maximum break on either table. Seated on the wrong side of the partition, Nicholls ended up watching Allen’s maximum break on a monitor.Williams gained a 9-7 lead after their evening session, with Vafaei making a 132 clearance in the final frame of the night. They will play to a finish on Saturday afternoon.View image in fullscreenMark Allen made Crucible crowd member Brian Nicholls £25,000 richer with his maximum break.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAJohn HigginsandXiao Guodongremain locked together at 8-8 at the end of the second session of their second-round match, which concludes on Saturday morning.The four-time champion Higgins looked set to start pulling away from his opponent after getting two snookers he required to force a respotted black when he led 7-6. But after appearing to have done enough to clinch the frame with a fine cut, he went in-off to hand the frame to Xiao and the last two of a fascinating and hard-fought session were shared.If Higgins and Williams both come through, the two Class of 92 legends, who have won seven world titles between them, will meet in the quarter-finals.Elsewhere,Zhao Xintongwill take a 5-3 lead into Saturday’s session of his clash with Chinese compatriotLei Peifan, whoknocked out the defending champion, Kyren Wilson.On Saturday afternoon Ronnie O’Sullivan will begin his second-round match against Pang Junxu, while in the evening Ding Junhui starts his clash with Luca Brecel, and Si Jiahui takes on Ben Woollaston,the conqueror of Mark Selby.Hearn warns Crucible days could be numberedSince first hosting the world championship in 1977, Sheffield’s Crucible theatre has been the spiritual home of snooker – but Barry Hearn has again warned the venue is no longer “fit for purpose”.With the hosting contract expiring in two years, Matchroom, which has largely controlled snooker since 2010, is heavily involved in negotiations and Hearn says ideally the WorldSnookerTour (WST) wants to stay. But the 76-year-old, whose son Eddie is the Matchroom chairman, has called on Sheffield city council to expand the venue or face losing the event.“It’s black and white: we love the Crucible, we love Sheffield, but the Crucible and Sheffield have got to love us,” Hearn, the former chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association told BBC Radio 5 Live.“We want to stay but the financials have to be taken into consideration. The facilities where the Crucible is are no longer fit for purpose, that’s the key issue. The Crucible’s been a big part of my life and a big part of snooker’s life. But it has to move with the times and someone, whether it’s government or Sheffield, have to come up with a way of showing us that they’re going to treat us with respect and give us the type of facilities we require. It’s as simple as that.“Maybe we should take this worldwide. Maybe it should be one year in Beijing, one year in Saudi and one year in Sheffield. We have to move with the times,” Hearn added. “I’m concerned with increasing the prize money as we have done with darts. Snooker needs to be more commercially viable.”Hearn warned: “The contract period ends in 2027 and we need a decision soon. We want to stay in Sheffield, so show me the way.”Last week the WST, Sheffield city council and Sheffield Theatres said that due to the “sensitive and commercial nature of these ongoing discussions”, no announcement would be made during this year’s event.Explore more on these topicsWorld Snooker ChampionshipSnookerSheffieldnewsShareReuse this content"

It was at No 2 – and who wasn’t picked later – where things got a little more interesting on Thursday night in Green Bay.Jacksonville, who had been sitting at No 5, traded up to take the Cleveland Browns’ spot at No 2, where the Jaguars selected Travis Hunter. Hunteris one of the most fascinating playersto enter the NFL in years: a superbly talented athlete who can play both offense, at wide receiver, and defense, at cornerback. In return, the Browns received four picks, including the Jags’ second- and fourth-rounders this year and their 2026 first-rounder. Jacksonville also received a fourth-rounder and a sixth-rounder in return from the Browns.But one man whose name wouldn’t be called all night was Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Some scouts believe Sanders, who was coached at Colorado by his father and Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, is a better prospect than Ward. Others had raised questions about his arm strength and readiness for theNFL.Travis Hunter wants to be the NFL’s Shohei Ohtani. Will anyone let him?Read morePittsburgh were seen as a possible landing spot for Sanders but they opted for Oregon defensive tackle Derrick Harmon with the 21st pick. TheNew York Giantsthen traded for the Texans’ pick at No 25. They did go for a quarterback, but instead chose Jaxson Dart of Ole Miss. Sanders will now have to wait until at least the second round, which starts on Friday, to learn his future.“We all didn’t expect this, of course, but I feel like with God, anything possible, everything possible,” Sanders said after falling out the first round. “I don’t feel like this happened for no reason. All of this is, of course, fuel to the fire. Under no circumstances did we all know this was going to happen, but we understand we on to bigger and better things. Tomorrow’s the day. We going to be happy regardless.”Ward had to endure no such wait. Titans fans cheered inside the draft theater after hearing his name called. An overlooked high school player out of Texas, Ward began his college career at Incarnate Word, an FCS school in San Antonio. He played two seasons at Washington State after transferring there in 2022 and then set school records in his only season at Miami, finishing fourth in Heisman Trophy voting.The Titans are coming off a three-win season and have missed the playoffs for three straight years. Ward is the fourth quarterback Tennessee have drafted in the first round over the past two decades, joining Marcus Mariota (No 2, 2015), Jake Locker (No 8, 2011) and Vince Young (No 3, 2006). Mariota is the only QB drafted by Tennessee in that span who led the team to a playoff win, and that was back in 2017.Will Levis, the 33rd overall pick in 2023, is 5-16 as a starter in his two seasons with the Titans. Ward, who is expected to be QB1 next season in Nashville, led the country with 39 touchdown passes and finished second with 4,313 yards passing while leading the Hurricanes to a 10-3 record. Ward also had only seven interceptions and completed 67.2% of his passes.View image in fullscreenCam Ward holds up his Titans jersey after being officially selected as the NFL draft’s No 1 pickPhotograph: Tannen Maury/UPI/ShutterstockThe top three was rounded out by the Giants, who went for Penn State defensive end Abdul Carter. Carter, who led the country with 23.5 tackles for loss and also had 12 sacks last season, bolsters a Giants defense that already has solid pass rushers in Kayvon Thibodeaux and Brian Burns, plus a strong D-line that includes Pro Bowler Dexter Lawrence.The New England Patriots decided to add protection for Drake Maye, the promising quarterback they took in the first round last year, by selecting LSU offensive tackle Will Campbell. At 6ft 6in and 320lb, Campbell was a three-year starter for the Tigers and a first-team All-America selection as a junior last season. Campbell played 37 of his 38 college games at left tackle and logged 2,451 snaps. He allowed just two sacks over the past two seasons, and now his job will be to protect the blind side of Maye.The Browns, picking at No 5 after their trade with the Jaguars, chose Michigan defensive tackle Mason Graham, the defensive MVP in the Rose Bowl during the Wolves’ national championship season in 2023.“We felt like it was a fantastic opportunity for our organization to go down three spots and add a player in the trenches,” the Browns GM, Andrew Berry, said of the trade with the Jags after selecting Graham.The first running back off the board arrived when the Las Vegas Raiders selected Boise State’s Ashton Jeanty with the sixth overall pick. Las Vegas averaged just 79.8 yards rushing per game last season – the worst rushing offense in the NFL – and Jeanty may remind Raiders coach Pete Carroll of Marshawn Lynch, whom he coached in Seattle. Jeanty often went his own version of “Beast Mode” at Boise State and was the only player, according to Pro Football Focus, to rush for more than 1,000 yards last season on plays that included a broken tackle.In a first round short of quarterbacks, the New York Jets selected Missouri offensive tackle Armand Membou with the seventh pick. Arizona wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan went to the Carolina Panthers with the No 8 pick. At No 9, the New Orleans Saints chose Texas offensive tackle Kelvin Banks Jr.Michigan’s Colston Loveland became the first tight end off the board when the Chicago Bears selected him at No 10. Loveland set a school record for a tight end with 56 receptions for 582 yards and five touchdowns as a junior last season. Loveland gives the Bears a potentially potent tight-end tandem with Cole Kmet. New coach Ben Johnson liked to use two tight ends when he was Detroit’s offensive coordinator.There was a roar from the home crowd in Green Bay when they took the talented Texas wide receiver, Matthew Golden, at No 23. It broke a long trend for the Packers: they had not picked a wide receiver in the first round since 2002.NFL 2025 first-round picks1) Tennessee Titans,Cam Ward, QB, Miami2) Jacksonville Jaguars,Travis Hunter, WR/CB, Colorado(from Browns)3) New York Giants,Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State4) New England Patriots,Will Campbell, OT, LSU5) Cleveland Browns,Mason Graham, DT, Michigan(from Jaguars)6) Las Vegas Raiders,Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State7) New York Jets,Armand Membou, OT, Missouri8) Carolina Panthers,Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona9) New Orleans Saints,Kelvin Banks Jr, OT, Texas10) Chicago Bears,Colston Loveland, TE, Michigan11) San Francisco 49ers,Mykel Williams, Edge, Georgia12) Dallas Cowboys,Tyler Booker, OG, Alabama13) Miami Dolphins,Kenneth Grant, DT, Michigan14) Indianapolis Colts,Tyler Warren, TE, Penn State15) Atlanta Falcons,Jalon Walker, LB, Alabama16) Arizona Cardinals,Walter Nolen, DT, Mississippi17) Cincinnati Bengals,Shemar Stewart, edge, Texas A&M18) Seattle Seahawks,Grey Zabel, OG, North Dakota State19) Tampa Bay Buccaneers,Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio State20) Denver Broncos,Jahdae Barron, CB, Texas21) Pittsburgh Steelers,Derrick Harmon, DT, Oregon22) Los Angeles Chargers,Omarion Hampton, RB, North Carolina23) Green Bay Packers,Matthew Golden, WR, Texas24) Minnesota Vikings,Donovan Jackson, OG, Ohio State25) New York Giants,Jaxson Dart, QB, Ole Miss(from Texans)26) Atlanta Falcons,James Pearce Jr, edge, Tennessee(from Rams)27) Baltimore Ravens,Malaki Starks, S, Georgia28) Detroit Lions,Tyleik Williams, DT, Ohio State29) Washington Commanders,Josh Conerly Jr, Oregon30) Buffalo Bills,Maxwell Hairston, CB, Kentucky31) Philadelphia Eagles,Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama(from Chiefs)32) Kansas City Chiefs,Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio State(from Eagles)Explore more on these topicsNFLTennessee TitansJacksonville JaguarsNew York GiantsCleveland BrownsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the future we’re all going to be bosses – of AI employees.The tech company is predicting the rise of a new kind of business, called a “frontier firm”, where ultimately a human worker directs autonomous artificial intelligence agents to carry out tasks.Everyone, according to Microsoft, will become an agent boss.“As agents increasingly join the workforce, we’ll see the rise of the agent boss: someone who builds, delegates to and manages agents to amplify their impact and take control of their career in the age of AI,” wrote Jared Spataro, a Microsoft executive, in a blogpost this week. “From the boardroom to the frontline, every worker will need to think like the CEO of an agent-powered startup.”Microsoft, a leading backer of theChatGPT developer OpenAI, expects every organisation to be on their way to becoming a frontier firm within the next five years. It said these entities would be “markedly different” from those of today and would be structured around what Microsoft called “on-demand intelligence”, using AI agents to gain instant answers on queries related to an array of internal tasks from compiling sales data to drawing up finance projections.The company said in itsannual Work Trend Index report: “These companies scale rapidly, operate with agility, and generate value faster.”It expects the emergence of the AI boss class to take place over three phases: first, every employee will have an AI assistant; then AI agents will join teams as “digital colleagues” taking on specific tasks; and finally humans will set directions for these agents, who go off on “business processes and workflows” with their bosses “checking in as needed”.Microsoft said AI’s impact on knowledge work – a catch-all term for a range of professions from scientists to academics and lawyers – will go the same way as software development, by evolving from coding assistance to agents carrying out tasks.Using the example of a worker’s role in a supply chain, Microsoft said agents could handle end-to-end logistics while humans guide the system and manage relationships with suppliers.Microsoft has beenpushing AI’s deploymentin the workplace throughautonomous AI agents, or tools that can carry out tasks without human intervention. Last year it announced that early adopters of Microsoft’s Copilot Studio product, which deploys bots, included the blue-chip consulting firm McKinsey, which is using agents to carry out tasks such as scheduling meetings with prospective clients.AI’s impact on the modern workforce is one of the key economic and policy challenges produced by the technology’s rapid advance. While Microsoft says AI will remove “drudge” work and increase productivity – a measure of economic effectiveness – experts also believe it could result in widespread job losses.This year theUK government-backed International AI Safety reportsaid “many people could lose their current jobs” if AI agents become highly capable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, job losses will ultimately number in the low hundreds of thousands because the technology will also produce new jobs, the institute estimates.DrAndrew Rogoyski, a director at the Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey, said organisations that used AI agents would ultimately be tempted to employ fewer workers. “The temptation will be to use AI workers to displace human effort as companies strive to become more efficient, with lower operational costs,” he said.“The danger of replacing humans with AI, apart from the socio-economic impact, is that we lose the knowledge in people’s heads that sustain companies, create innovative products and build meaningful relationships with customers and suppliers.”Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftArtificial intelligence (AI)Technology sectorComputingOpenAIChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

Apple is secretive about details of its production processes but analysts estimate that about 90% of its iPhones are assembled in the country.According to the FT, Apple plans to source fromIndiathe more than 60m iPhones sold in the US annually by the end of 2026 – a commitment that would require more than doubling iPhone assembly in India.Apple has already been ramping up production in India and diverting iPhones assembled in the country to the US. The company’s main Indian suppliers, Foxconn and Tata, shipped almost $2bn worth of handsets to their largest market in March asApplesought to offset the impact of looming tariffs.It also chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tonnes of iPhones – or as many as 1.5m devices – to the US to ensure sufficient inventory in an important market. Apple has three plants in India and last month temporarily extended operations to Sunday working at the biggestFoxconnIndia factory in Chennai.More than 5o% of Apple’s Mac products and 80% of its iPads are assembled in China as well, according to US investment bank Evercore. Apple watches are largely built in Vietnam.Analysts do not expect Apple to move iPhone production to the US, despite the White House insisting that the manufacturing of an American tech product willultimately return home. The US president’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters that Apple’s recent announcement of a $500bn investment indicated a US-made iPhone was possible.“IfAppledidn’t think the US could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,” she said.However, experts have played down the prospect.

That’s where he’s building a massive supercomputer to power his company xAI. Community residents and environmental activists say that since the supercomputer was fired up last summer it has become one of the biggest air polluters in the county. But some local officials have championed the billionaire, saying he is investing in Memphis.The first public hearing with the health department is scheduled for Friday, where county officials will hear from all sides of the debate. In the run-up to the hearing, secretive fliers claiming xAI has low emissions were sent to residents of historically Black neighborhoods; at the same time, environmental groups have been amassing data about how much pollution the AI company is likely generating.Trump can’t withhold funds from sanctuary cities, says federal judgeRead moreThe dispute came to a head earlier this month when the Southern Environmental Law Center revealed that xAI had quietly moved in at least35 portable methane gas turbineswithout air permits to help power its supercomputer. The group says this many generators have the capacity to power an entire city and are enormous emitters of toxic and carcinogenic pollution. The law center made the discovery by taking satellite images of the xAI facility.Days after the news broke, Memphis mayor Paul Young spoke in a public forum and said he had been in contact with xAI and that the company was not using all of the gas generators,according to WREG News. Young, who has long supported xAI’s operations in Memphis, noted that the company has a pending permit application with the Shelby county health department to run 15 generators.“There are 35, but there are only 15 that are on,” Young said. “The other ones are stored on the site.”View image in fullscreenThermal images in Memphis.Photograph: Steve Jones/Flight by Southwings for Southern Environmental Law CenterNow, the Southern Environmental Law Center has taken new photos of xAI that include thermal imaging. These photos show 33 turbines giving off significant amounts of heat, meaning they were all likely in use at the time the photo was taken.“It is appalling that xAI would operate more than 30 methane gas turbines without any permits or any public oversight,” said Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. “xAI’s failure to disclose that it’s running dozens of these polluting turbines at its southMemphisdata center has left Memphians in the dark about what is being pumped into the air they breathe every day.”xAI, Young and the Shelby county health department did not return requests for comment.Musk calls the xAI supercomputer “Colossus”. It’s tasked with providing compute power forxAI’s chatbot Grok. The building that houses Colossus is the size of 13 football fields and Musk has saidhe plans to double that.Last month, hepurchased another propertyin Memphis to expand xAI’s infrastructure there. The new property is 1m sq ft.Artificial intelligence requires an immense amount of energy to carry out computations and provide quick responses to user queries. In the US, the majority of that electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. Within a couple of miles of xAI are several residential neighborhoods that have long dealt with industrial pollution. This area is historically Black and has higher rates of cancer and asthma and a lower life expectancy than other parts of the city.View image in fullscreenAn xAI flier sent to residents in Memphis.Photograph: Courtesy Keshaun PearsonMembers of this community have beenoutspoken in their opposition to xAIand have called for more oversight and environmental regulations on the company. Over the past week, thousands of residents here said they received fliers in the mail that downplay the pollution emitted from xAI’s gas turbines.The fliers come from an anonymous group called Facts Over Fiction and have a bullet point list that alleges the turbines are “cleaner tech” and “minor” polluters because they use gas, rather than diesel or coal. The fliers say that the generators are low emissions and are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Shelby county health department. Both of those agencies have said they did not issue permits for xAI’s gas generators.“Those 15 xAI turbines?” the flier reads. “They’re specially designed to protect the air we all breathe.”Justin Pearson, a Tennessee state representative who is from this part of Memphis, said in anInstagram postthat the fliers are “lying to us about xAI’s methane gas pollution” and “we know methane gas leads to more asthma attacks, leads to more respiratory illness”.He demanded to know who sent the fliers and encouraged all community members to attend the public hearing on Friday. “We have to combat the lies and misinformation,” he wrote. “Clean air is a human right and the [Shelby county health department] has a duty to protect the air we breathe.”Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTennesseeMemphisArtificial intelligence (AI)Climate crisisPollutionComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Why did Yale allow this?Fri 25 Apr 2025 15.08 EDTFirst published on Fri 25 Apr 2025 13.00 EDTShareLet me start with a statement that should be obvious: deliberately starving 2 million people – half of whom are children – is indefensible. It is not complicated, it is not a nuanced situation that requires a PhD to parse. It is not an unfortunate and unavoidable part of war. It is quite simply indefensible. I would say that it is also very much prohibited by international human rights law, but that doesn’t seem to exist any more, does it?As I write this,no food, water or medicinehas been allowed intoGazafor almost two months. It is impossible to know just how bad the situation really is because Israel has imposed a media blackout on the region. However, aid organizationshave said: “The Gaza Strip is now likely facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the 18 months” since the war began. Thousands of children are malnourished. Childhood malnutrition, I can’t stress enough, has long-term consequences. An entire generation’s future has been violently stolen from them.“Starving kids to death is bad, actually” isn’t a statement that should require any debate. Over in the White House and the hallowed halls of Yale, however, they seem to think otherwise. OnWednesday night, an organization called Shabtai, which is based at Yale though not officially affiliated with it, hosted Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, for a talk.I spoke to children in Gaza this week and here’s what they told me: they just want to live | Shaima Al-ObaidiRead moreBen-Gvir has had the red carpet rolled out for him by the US. The extremist politician came to New Haven following an extravagant dinner, presumably paid for by US taxpayers, atDonald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort the night before. While he ate fancy food with Republican party officials they all reportedly discussed how they could starve kids in Gaza more efficiently. “[Lawmakers] expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed in order to create military and political pressure to bring our hostages home safely,” Ben-Gvir tweeted following the dinner.I’ll give Ben-Gvir his due. He doesn’t even try to hide his hatred for Arabs. If Ben-Gvir were a Palestinian, every single politician and media outlet would be in an uproar that he was anywhere near Yale. The man lives on an illegal settlement in the occupied West Bank and has advocated for the deportation of all Arab citizens. He had a picture in his living room for years of Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron in 1994. He has previous convictions forinciting racism and supporting terrorism.Again, Shabtai is not officially associated with Yale but it very much looks like a Yale organization, especially as it is based there. It was founded by the Democratic senator andYale alumnus Cory Bookerand the New Haven rabbi Shmully Hecht. Speaking to Shabtai, with all its elite associations, grants Ben-Gvir respectability. It gives his violent and racist ideas legitimacy. Particularly as Hecht – a man closely associated with Booker – has saidhe admires Ben-Gvir. At the time of writing, Booker hadn’t made a public statement about Ben-Gvir’s Shabtai invitation and had not responded to a request for comment.Several Shabtai members, I should note, have objected to Hecht’s comments about Ben-Gvir and two have resigned from the society. But Yale has not issued a clear condemnation of the far-right politician. Again: Shabtai is not an official Yale organization but it has enough ties to the university that, by not speaking out, the Ivy League institute is in effect endorsing one of the most extremist politicians in Israel. Particularly since Yale has simultaneously been very busy doing what US colleges seem to enjoy doing most: demonizing anyone who speaks out about genocide. A pro-Palestinian student group was stripped of its official recognition by Yale after it was accused of involvement inprotests against Ben-Gvir.But I don’t want to focus too much on Ben-Gvir because he’s not the real issue here. This isn’t about one man giving a speech – it’s about who is allowed to speak and who isn’t. What facts get reported and what don’t. What the media, politicians and thought leaders choose to get outraged about and what they ignore. It’s about the real-time manufacturing of consent for the US-enabled atrocities happening inGazaand the West Bank, and the systematic quashing of dissent.Pro-Palestinian speech is beingsystematically eradicatedin the US on multiple fronts. Palestinian viewpoints are being erased, punished or ignored. Ice, of course, has been very busy for weeks nowdetainingand deporting pro-Palestinian activists. Meanwhile, on Wednesday the FBI violently raided the homes of pro-Palestinian activists linked to University of Michigan protests. And earlier this week a performance by the R&B star Kehlani at Cornell University in New York state was cancelled, with the university’s president saying the booking of the singer had “injected division and discord” at Cornell because ofher stance on Israel.The message from the government and from elite institutions is very clear: speak up about Palestine and you will be punished for it. These raids and deportations, the cancelling of contracts and opportunities, aren’t just meant to punish individuals, but to have a chilling effect on the masses.More insidious silencing is happening on social media, where it is getting harder to share pro-Palestinian content. According to leaked internal Meta data recently obtained byDrop Site News: “A sweeping crackdown on posts on Instagram and Facebook that are critical of Israel – or even vaguely supportive of Palestinians – was directly orchestrated by the government of Israel … The data show that Meta has complied with 94% of takedown requests issued by Israel since October 7, 2023.”Dozens of my family have been killed by Israel in Gaza, and now Ziyad, too. Only one thing gives me solace | Ghada AgeelRead moreOn cable news, Palestinian perspectives are routinely ignored. (Networks that were preoccupied with issues of campus safety in the past certainly don’t seem to have run any segments about how Arab students at Yale might feel threatened by having Ben-Gvir celebrated on campus.) Last December, the Nation analyzed a year’s worth of Palestine-Israel coverage by four Sunday morning news shows – NBC’s Meet the Press, ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos, CBS’s Face the Nation and CNN’s State of the Union with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. It found that “withthe exception of one interview, the Sunday shows covered and debated the so-called ‘Israel-Hamas war’ for 12 months without speaking to a single Palestinian or Palestinian American.” The shows featured Israeli guests 20 times, along with multiple appearances from pro-Israel US guests. This is what “objectivity” on Palestine and Israel looks like in the media.Once again: kids are being actively starved to death in Gaza as I write this. This should prompt nonstop outrage in the media. And yet there seems to have been far more outrage in certain sections of the US media about the fact that the Irish rap group Kneecap recently ended their Coachella set by displaying the message: “Fuck Israel, Free Palestine.” Fox News went into acomplete tizzyabout it. Meanwhile, Sharon Osbourne denounced their “aggressive statements” and called for the group to have theirUS visas revoked. Kneecap responded to Osbourneby noting: “Statements aren’t aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.” If only that were more obvious to people.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsYale UniversityOpinionIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warChildrenPalestinian territoriesUS universitiescommentShareReuse this content"

Others are realising that they can’t afford not toFri 25 Apr 2025 13.30 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 14.16 EDTShareEnfeebling universities or seizing control is an early chapter in the authoritarian playbook, studied eagerly by the likes ofViktor Orbán in Hungary. “Would-be authoritarians and one-party states centrally target universities with the aim of restricting dissent,” Jason Stanley, a scholar of fascism at Yale,wrotein the Guardian in September. Last month, he announced that he wasleaving the USfor Canada because of the political climate and particularly thebattle over higher education.It is not merely that universities are often bastions of liberal attitudes and hotbeds for protest. They also constitute one of the critical institutions of civil society; they are a bulwark of democracy. The Trump administration is taking on judges, lawyers,NGOsand the media: it would be astonishing if universities were not on the list. They embody the importance of knowledge, rationality and independent thought.In a typically brazen reversal, Donald Trump has accused his administration’s top target – Harvard – of being the“threat to democracy”. The administration is attackingdiversity, equity and inclusion effortsand says it is tackling the failure of universities to root out antisemitism – a claim widelychallenged. Most Trump supporters are unlikely to take issue with cutting billions of dollars of public spending on wealthy elite institutions. A pragmatic counter-argument would be that much of that money goes to scientific and medical research that will enrich the US as a nation and benefit vast numbers of people who have never ventured near an Ivy League university.The administration’s outrageous demands of Harvard include federal oversight of admissions, the dismantling of diversity programmes, an end to recruitment of international students “hostile to American values”, and the compelled hiring of “viewpoint diverse” staff.Harvard has commendably chosen to fight back. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” wrote its president, Alan Garber. It issuingthe government over the freeze on $2.2bn in federal funding, part of a threat to withhold $9bn. That is encouraging others to speak out. Over 150 university presidents have signed a joint letterdenouncing“unprecedented government overreach and political interference”.Many have pointed out that the world’s richest university can afford to stand firm thanks to itsunrivalled $53bn endowmentand sympatheticbillionaire alumni. But its the same prestige and power that have surely made it the primary target: force it to fold, and weaker institutions will follow. It’s worth noting that Harvard toughened its position after faculty, students and alumnipushed hard for it to do so, warning that concessions would only encourage the administration. Columbiaacquiescedto an extraordinary list of demands but $400m of withheld funding has yet to be restored, and the administration is reportedly seekingto extend controlover the university.Whatever comes of Harvard’s suit, this is an administration that has already chosen to ignore court rulings. It may step up its assault, by revoking charitable status and clamping down on international students. (Many may already be concluding that studying in the US, however eminent the institution, may not be worth the hostile immigration environment.) But Harvard is fighting back not just because it can, but because it must. In doing so, it is defending not only academic freedom, but democracy more broadly – and inspiring others to do so.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Laid bare in his handling of that issue are not only his myriad weaknesses, but also the danger he poses to his own country and the wider world – to say nothing of the battered people of Ukraine itself.Don’t be fooled by the mild, vaguely theatrical rebuke Trump issued to Vladimir Putin on Thursday after Moscow unleashed a deadly wave of drone strikes on Kyiv, killing 12 and injuring dozens: “Vladimir, STOP!” Payattention instead to the fact that, in the nearly 100 days since Trump took office, the US has essentially switched sides in the battle between Putin’s Russia and democratic Ukraine, backing the invaders against the invaded.On Friday, Trump’s real-estate buddy and special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, held talks in Moscow with Putin. But any resemblance between the US and an honest broker is purely coincidental. On the contrary, previous encounters between the two men resulted in Witkoffparroting Kremlin talking points, essentially endorsing Russia’s claim to the Ukrainian territory it seized. In that, Witkoff was merely following the lead set by his boss: the supposed peace deal Trump is now in a hurry to seal amounts to handing Putin almost everything he wants and demanding Ukraine surrender.Hence Trump’s anger on Wednesday, when he accused Volodymyr Zelenskyy of making “inflammatory statements”. What had the Ukrainian president said that was so incendiary? He had calmly pointed out that he could not do as Trump demanded and recognise Russian control of Crimea, which Russia grabbed in 2014, because it was forbidden by his country’s constitution. It’s telling that Trump should be enraged by a president who thinks constitutions have to be respected.Whether Trump succeeds in making Kyiv buckle or not, the new reality is clear. The US president is taking an axe to an international order constructed in the aftermath of a bloody world war, a system that has held, however imperfectly, since 1945. A central tenet of that order was that big states could not simply swallow up smaller ones, that unprovoked aggression and conquest would no longer be allowed to stand. Yet here is Trump bent on rewarding just such an act of conquest, not simply acquiescing in Putin’s land grab inUkrainebut conferring on it the legitimacy of approval by the world’s most powerful nation.Note how he speaks as if Putin had every right to seize the territory of his neighbour. Asked this week what concessions, if any, he had extracted from Moscow, Trump replied that Putin’s willingness to stop the war, rather than gobbling up Ukraine in its entirety, was a “pretty big concession”.This is not only a disaster for Ukraine, though it is obviously that. It is also the destruction of global architecture that has stood for many decades – and it is hardly a lone case. Trump’s tariff fetish is similarly upending a system of international trade that had made the world, and especially the US, more prosperous. The consequences are already visible, in plunging global stock markets,gloomy growth forecastsandwarnings of a recessionthat will start in the US and then spread everywhere else.Trump’s eagerness to acquiesce in Putin’s seizure of Ukraine makes a dead letter of international law, with its prohibition of the crime of aggression, and that too points to a wider pattern. For Trump is at war with the law at home as well as abroad. Indeed, in three short months, it has become an open question whether the rule of law still operates in the US.That peril is revealed most clearly in Trump’s willingness to defy the orders of the US courts. Judges have issued multiple rulings, seeking, for example, to delay or overturn the deportation of migrants without due process, only for those judges to be ignored or targeted with personal invective from the president. For the latestPolitics Weekly America podcast, I spoke to Liz Oyer, a former justice department official fired last month after she refused to restore gun-owning rights to the actor and Trump pal Mel Gibson: he hadlost themwhen he was convicted of domestic violence in 2011. Oyer is a sober, nonpartisan former civil servant, but she told me of her fears if the Trump administration continues to refuse to comply with the law as laid down by the courts. “We will have a true crisis on our hands. They are testing the limits.”Part of Trump’s assault on the law has come in a flurry of executive orders,targeting specific, named law firmsthat had previously acted for his opponents. He offered the firms a choice: either be barred by presidential diktat from cases involving the federal government, or commit to giving Trump and his administration free legal advice worth tens of millions of dollars. So many firms have caved in, the president now has access to an estimated $1bn (£750m) war chest of pro bono legal services. Trump has been bragging about it, but there’s a word for what he has done: extortion.It’s a favourite weapon of Trump’s and it’s been on display in Ukraine too. Let’s not forget the “deal” Trump wants to strike with Zelenskyy: a degree of US protection in return forhalf of the revenuefrom Ukraine’s minerals, ports and infrastructure. This is not the behaviour of an ally, but a gangster.Everything Trump does, and has always done, he is doing in and to Ukraine. Recall the hyperbolic promise he made to end the war within “24 hours” of returning to the White House. It was of a piece with the inflated hype that puffed up his real-estate career – and about as reliable. The same goes for his campaign promise to end inflation on “day one”, when his tariff policy is only going to push up prices.Now he threatens to walk away from Ukraine altogether, impatient to get a deal in time for his 100th-day celebrations on Tuesday. That’s typical too: so often Trump’s grand plans turn to dust because, if he doesn’t get an instant reward, he gets bored and drifts away. Witkoff’s previous role was securing a lasting ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Now that’s fallen apart, he’s moved on to other things.Above all, Trump’s willingness to capitulate to Putin on Ukraine is a reminder not only of his own authoritarian ambitions – he likes Putin because he wants to be like Putin – but also of how serially bad a negotiator this self-styled artist of the deal really is. He declared tariff war on China, thinking he could squeeze the US’s great economic rival. Instead, America’s biggest retailers this week warned that their shelves couldsoon be empty, thanks to the havoc Trump’s tariffs are unleashing on the global supply chain. Container traffic across the Pacific from China is already down byas much as 60%, meaning Americans are not going to get the goods they’ve come to rely on. Those shortages will lead to voter anger directed at Trump. To avert it, he needs a deal with China – desperately. He goes to the table weak, facing an opponent he has made strong. So much for the maestro dealmaker.There is no mystery to Trump. It’s all plain to see – the habits of the vandal, the autocrat, the gangster and the fool – with Ukraine as clear a guide as any. Not that that is any comfort to the people of that besieged land. They don’t want to be a cautionary tale, a demonstration case of the fecklessness and menace of Donald Trump. They want to be a free, independent nation. Their great misfortune is that the mighty country that should be their most powerful friend is now in the hands of an enemy.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist and the host of thePolitics Weekly America podcast100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guests.

A day after the“peace talks” in London, which the US secretary of state Marco Rubio didn’t even turn up for, Ukrainians were not anxiously waiting for the results of a possible deal, which looked unfeasible anyway. Instead, theywere counting their dead.According to Ukraine’s air force, in the early hours of Thursday morningRussia launched11 Iskander ballistic missiles, 37 KH-101 cruise missiles, six Iskander-K cruise missiles, 12 Kalibr cruise missiles, 4 KH-59/KH-69 missiles and 145 drones. For Kyiv and Kharkiv residents that night, this was not just a case of reading numbers on a news feed,but hearing and feeling explosions rock their cities. It turned out to bethe deadliest nightfor the Ukrainian capital this year.“Not necessary and very bad timing,” Donald Trump later wrote on social media. But, Ukrainians might ask, when would be a better time to kill 12 civilians and injure at least 90?Most people were asleep in the western suburbs ofKyiv that were hit. Most of the homes in a five-story apartment block were damaged. A ballistic missile –allegedly North Korean– destroyed an older two-story house. Most of the casualties lived there.At the time of writing – late afternoon on Thursday – rescue workers and firefighters had been working on the pile of rubble for 15 hours. A group of teenagers came to watch. Some arrived early in the morning because their friend and schoolmate, Danya Khudya, 17, lived in that house with his parents. Earlier, Danya’s sister was sent to the hospital, but the boywas missing under the rubble. So, the kids started to search, helping the rescue workers and the police. “Is he alive?” they kept asking.US military aid for Ukraine is about to cease. Is Europe ready? | David ShimerRead moreBy the end of the day, more than 50 young people were there silently gazing into the rubble behind the tape. They stood, hardly moving, just hugging each other. They were waiting for a miracle. It didn’t happen. Around 5pm, Danya’s body was found. The relatives were asked to identify the body. His parents, Vika and Oleh, had died, too.In front of the house, I saw a man, his face covered with shrapnel injuries , standing in his slippers. He was offered help – someone asked if he needed proper shoes. But he refused and didn’t understand why he was being treated as a victim. He said that he had everything at home. Should he be grateful?I have written before about how Kyivites haveturned their anger into action. They are still doing that now, but there is also something else in the air – a sense of confusion and bewilderment. Is this the new normal?I think this is because residents of the capital had become used to Ukraine’s air defences protecting the city.The first Patriots– the US army’s central air defence system –arrived in Kyiva year after the invasion in February 2022. The system proved capable of intercepting and destroying theKinzhal, a Russian hypersonic ballistic missile.Vladimir Putin had boastedthat the missiles were “invincible”. Since then, hundreds of them have been repelled in the air above Ukraine’s cities and towns.But there arefewer than 10 air defence systems in Ukraine– this is simply not enough for what is, after all, the second-largest country in Europe after Russia. Recently, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a request to the US to buy – not to be given –10 additional Patriot systems.Trump treated it as a joke, as an example of Ukrainian warmongering.This matters because the missiles for the Patriots are the most important part of US military aid (beyond intelligence) that European partners can’t deliver themselves. Even if allies try to buy them forUkraine, it is up to the US to permit outsourcing them. On top of that, Washington can remotely restrict use of the system, as it retains control over the technology and components, which rely on US software updates and radar configurations.This is the real leverage that the US has against Ukraine – the cudgel it could use to force Kyiv into accepting peace on Russian terms.Those terms includefreezing the frontline, Ukraine conceding up to 20% of its sovereign land and relying on Moscow’s goodwill that it would not attack again. In comparison, Russia might receive not just recognition by the US of illegally annexed Ukrainian territories, but also the lifting of US sanctions.Ukrainians don’t have the luxury of indulging in the fantasies and distortions of Truth Social, or X, or Russian state TV. They have no choice but to believe in the rockets flying over their heads, the news of dead neighbours – in short, in reality. The events of this week are about as vivid a demonstration you can get that the war is still happening, that it is real, and that Moscow has no real desire to end it.Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism LabDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My mother is a former mathematician, who studied the various levels of infinity as part of her master’s thesis. My father is a computer programmer who, at 17 years old, was one of the youngest people to ever be able to communicate with ships in morse code. They met at a party for members of Mensa, a club for the highly intelligent.But their gifts have come with challenges. My dad struggles with eye contact and can become easily overwhelmed in social settings, where emotion and nuance can short-circuit his systems. My mother has difficulty with executive function, and finds it tough to stay neat and organized. Regulating their emotions and reading social cues don’t come easily to either of them.My father was first diagnosed with what was then known as Asperger’s syndrome in his 20s. My mother has never been officially diagnosed asautistic, but identifies as such. When I was a child desperately wanting to fit in with others, I found their neurodivergence to be embarrassing. I wanted what I thought other kids had: parents who got them to school on time, who didn’t have unpredictable, emotional flare-ups or constantly messy homes.RFK’s statements prove autistic people and their families everywhere should fear Trump and his allies | John HarrisRead moreNow as an adult, living in a time when neurodivergence is more openly discussed and understood, I’ve come to see their quirks not as flaws but as unique features of who they are. I’ll call my mom when I’m struggling across a tricky math problem, knowing she’ll light up with excitement at the opportunity to assist me with her expertise. I love watching my dad pour himself into his ham radio community, where friendships are forged without the pressure of eye contact.That’s why, when I first heardRFK Jrvow to theTrump administrationto find the cause behind the so-called “autism epidemic”, describing it as a “cataclysm”, I got scared. Was the person in charge of the federal government’s healthcare apparatus really describing my parents as victims of an illness that we, as a society, have let get out of control?Later that week, he doubled down, calling autism spectrum disorder a “preventable disease” that “tears families part”, citing thegrowing ratesof ASD among children: one in 31 kids in 2022, compared with one in 36 kids in 2020. “These are kids who will never pay taxes. They’ll never hold a job. They’ll never play baseball. They’ll never write a poem. They’ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.”Autism is, in fact, being diagnosed more than ever before, but scientists largely attribute this to increased awareness and a broader diagnostic criteria for the disorder. “When I started in this field in the late 60s, autism was a last resort diagnosis,” says Dr Catherine Lord, a clinical psychologist whose primary focus is ASD. “It was primarily given to kids with intellectual disabilities.”It’s also true that people in my generation have more autism diagnoses than our parents. But there are plenty of us out there who suspect our parents may have been on the spectrum, even though they were never formally evaluated. “It’s rare for a parent first to be diagnosed with autism, and then a child realizes they are also autistic,” Lord says. “It’s much more common for a parent to realize they’re on the spectrum after their kid’s been diagnosed.”RFK Jr’s blanket description of 2% of the population fails to take into account the wide spectrum of symptoms that people with autism experience. Some have higher needs than others. Many are able to mask their symptoms. Some are non-verbal – about 30%, according to the National Institutes of Health. All deserve to live in a society where they are understood, recognized and supported – not categorized, as RFK Jr describes, as a “tragic” aberration that needs to be snuffed out.The federal government says it is committing resources to finding the cause behind ASD (a condition that has been studied since the 1940s and is overwhelmingly attributed by scientists to genetics) and that it isstarting an autism databaseto track the private medical information of numerous Americans. At the same time, it is also poised to cut funding for autism research and support.Want to beat authoritarianism? Look to Latin America | Greg GrandinRead moreSlashes to theDepartment of EducationandNational Science Foundationmean less money for special needs kids and intervention programs.Reduced funding to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrationmeans autistic people, who are particularly vulnerable to mental illness, will have less access to mental health services. Meanwhile, there areconcerns that Congress will cut Medicaid coverage, which would lead to less behavioral support for autistic people, especially children and low-income families. “It just seems so contradictory,” Lord says.By saying autism is a “preventable disease” rather than a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, RFK Jr further stigmatizes an already vulnerable population and threatens to set back a decades-long effort to bring ASD into public awareness and acceptance. Schools already struggle with how to incorporate autistic children into everyday learning, and few programs exist (let alone are publicly funded) specifically for neurodivergent kids. An infinitesimal percentage of workplaces recognize the unique needs of their neurodivergent employees, making it difficult for people with ASD to find and keep employment.These days, my parents have learned to mask their autism to varying degreesNeither set of my grandparents understood their children were autistic, and so the support my parents received was limited. My mom’s parents shrugged their shoulders and categorized her as weirdly obstinate. My dad’s parents treated him like a prodigy, which, although a kinder approach, fostered a superiority complex and a host of anti-social behaviors, making it tough for him to find friends. As adults, both my parents struggled to hold down full-time employment at office jobs, presumably in part because their workplaces probably adhered to a rigid social compact and failed to recognize their unique needs.These days, my parents have learned to mask their autism to varying degrees. My father eventually taught himself how to sustain eye contact with others, and can now hold a conversation with minimal downward glances. They both, to a degree, have become more socially aware and work for themselves.So, no, autism did not ruin my family, as RFK Jr claims. If anything, their conditions have made me a more empathetic, understanding adult, which I believe makes me a better journalist, friend and daughter. But, I sometimes wonder: what would my parents’ lives have been like if society had made more room for them and others like them? I suspect that in a less ableist world, they would have led happier childhoods. And, I think, so too would I.Deborah Bloom is a text and video journalist who covers breaking news and human interest stories about gender, culture, mental health and the environmentExplore more on these topicsAutismOpinionRobert F Kennedy JrDisabilityTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Trump tore up the 2015 agreement, which had taken years for Iran to negotiate with six world powers, under which Tehran limited its nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions. Trump insisted he would be able to negotiate a better pact than the one reached by Barack Obama’s administration.Today, in his second term as president, Trump is eager to fix theIrandeal he broke nearly seven years ago.While Trump’s overall foreign policy has been chaotic and has alienated traditional US allies in Europe and elsewhere, he has an opportunity to reach an agreement with Iran that eluded Joe Biden. Since Trump walked away from the original deal, Iran has moved closer to having a nuclear weapon than it has ever been. It has enriched enough uranium close to weapons-grade quality tomake six nuclear bombs, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But analysts believe that even after enriching enough uranium for a bomb, Iran would still need up to a year to developan actual nuclear warheadthat could be deployed on a ballistic missile.Last month, Trump sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader, the 86-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying the US wanted to negotiate a new deal. Trump followed up with apublic threat, saying if Iran’s leaders did not agree to renewed talks, they would be subjected to “bombing the likes of which they have never seen before”. After Trump’s threats and abuildup of US forcesin the Middle East, Iran’s military saidit would respond to any attack by targeting US bases in the region, which house thousands of American troops.But Iranian leaders also agreed toindirect negotiations, rather than the direct talks Trump had proposed. Trump dispatched his special envoy, the real estate developer Steve Witkoff, to lead a team of US negotiators to meet indirectly with top Iranian officials, including the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi. The two sides held two rounds of productive talks so far this month, under the mediation of Oman. And the US and Iranian teams aredue to meet againthis weekend in Muscat, the capital of Oman, where they will start talks on technical details of a potential agreement.While Trump and Iran’s leaders both changed their tones in recent weeks, there are many obstacles before a deal can be reached, including hardliners in Iran and Washington, as well as opposition from Israel’s rightwing government, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, who has spent years working toundermine negotiationsbetween the US and Iran. The main barrier will be whether the Trump administration insists on a total dismantling of Iran’s nuclear program – the so-called “Libya model”, named after the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who decided to eliminate his country’s nuclear weapons program in 2003 under pressure from the US. But that decision deprived Gaddafi of a major lever to stave off western military intervention after the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, which led to his regime’s fall and his killing by Libyan rebels.Some foreign policy hawks in Washington, including Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, insist on this maximalist strategy, which echoes Netanyahu’s demand thatIran must completely dismantleits nuclear enrichment activity and infrastructure as part of any deal with the US. If Trump takes a similar approach, negotiations would probably break down and Trump could follow through on his threat to carry out military strikes.Iran has made clear that it will not agree to the total end of its nuclear program, but would accept a verification-based approach, as it did under the 2015 deal negotiated by the Obama administration along with China, France, Russia, the UK and Germany, together with the European Union. That type of agreement would place strict limits on Iran’s ability to enrich uranium and impose an inspections regime involving international monitors. Several of Trump’s advisers, including Witkoff and the vice-president, JD Vance, seem to favor this solution.Iran’s leaders apparently got that message – and have tried to stroke Trump’s ego“I think he wants to deal with Iran with respect,”Witkoff said of Trump’s outreachto the Iranian regime, in a long interview last month with Tucker Carlson, the rightwing media host who has been highly critical of Republican hawks agitating for war with Iran. “He wants to build trust with them, if it’s possible.”Iran’s leaders apparently got that message – and have tried to stroke Trump’s ego and convey that they respect him in ways they never respected Biden. In aWashington Post op-edpublished on 8 April, Iran’s foreign minister seemed to be speaking to Trump directly when he blamed the failure of earlier negotiations on a “lack of real determination by the Biden administration”. Araghchi also played to Trump’s oft-repeated desire to be a peacemaker who ends America’s legacy of forever wars, writing: “We cannot imagine President Trump wanting to become another US president mired in a catastrophic war in the Middle East.”And the minister appealed to Trump’s reputation as a deal-maker, citing the “trillion-dollar opportunity” that would benefit US companies if they could gain access to Iran after a diplomatic agreement. Iran’s leaders evidently understand that Trump loves to frame his foreign policy as being guided by his desire to secure economic deals and benefits for American businesses.In this case, Trump’s transactional instincts and bulldozer style of negotiations could lead to a positive outcome, avoiding war with Iran and undermining the hardliners in Washington, Iran and Israel. Trump has already adopted a significant shift toward Tehran from his first term, when he had insisted that Iran was the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and the greatest threat to US interests in the Middle East.After he took office in 2017, Trump wanted to tear up the Iran deal partly because it was one of Obama’s major foreign policy accomplishments. Trump also surrounded himself with hawkish advisers who reinforced the danger of an Iranian threat, including HR McMaster, who served as national security adviser, and James Mattis, who was defense secretary. Both men commanded US troops during the occupation of Iraq, and they fought Iraqi militias funded by Iran. Trump later appointed John Bolton, another neoconservative and advocate of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, as his national security adviser.In his second term, Trump has banished most of the neocons from his administration. Trump also seems to realize that Netanyahu could become one of the biggest obstacles to an Iran deal, as he was during the Obama and Biden administrations. It was no accident that the president announcedhis plan for renewed talkswith Iran while Netanyahu sat beside him at an Oval Office meeting on 7 April. Netanyahu had arranged a hasty visit to Washington to seek an exemption from Trump on new tariffs on Israeli exports. Buthe left empty-handedand embarrassed by Trump’s Iran announcement. That meeting was a signal to Iran’s leaders: that Trump would not allow Netanyahu to steamroll him, as the Israeli premier had done with other US presidents.If Trump continues to resist Netanyahu, along with hawkish Republicans and some of his own advisers, he might well be able to negotiate a dramatic deal with Iran – and repair the nuclear crisis he unleashed years ago.Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern studies and a journalism professor at New York University.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionAyatollah Ali KhameneiIranNuclear weaponscommentShareReuse this content"

But its democratic spirit remains vital – and offers a lesson for the USFri 25 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 12.03 EDTShareInspiration on how to beat back authoritarianism is in short supply, but those searching for hope in these dark times might consider Latin America.It’s not the first place that comes to mind when thinking about democracy, associated as it is with coups, death squads, dictatorships, inequality, drug violence and now a country,El Salvador, offering itself up toDonald Trumpas an offshore prison colony for deportees.It is a bleak place in many ways, especially for the jobless and the poor who flee their home countries in search of a better life somewhere else, often in the United States. The bleakness, though, only highlights the paradox: for all its maladies, for all its rightwing dictators and leftwing caudillos, for all its failings when it comes to democraticinstitutions, the region’s democraticspiritis surprisingly vital.Other areas of the world emerged broken from the cold war, roiled by resource conflicts, religious fundamentalism and ethnic hatreds. Think of the bloody Balkans of the 1990s or 1994’s Rwandan genocide.Trump has found in El Salvador a model for the repressive state he wants to build – and he’s just getting started | Jordana TimermanRead moreNot Latin America, where, by the time the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, most of its anti-communist dictatorships had given way to constitutional rule. With the jackboot off their necks, reformers went on the offensive, seeking to redeem not just democracy butsocialdemocracy.Today, in the United States at least, the concept of democracy is generally defined minimally, as comprising regularly held elections, a commitment to due process to protect individual rights, and institutional stability. But earlier, in the middle of the last century, a more robust vision that included economic rights prevailed – that indeed the second world war was fought not justagainstfascism butforsocial democracy. “Necessitous men are not free men,” Franklin Delano Roosevelt liked to say. Reporting from Europe in late 1945, William Shirer described a groundswell demand for social democracy, in an article headlined: Germany is finished, communists distrusted, majority wants socialism.Latin America joined in the demand, and by 1945 nearly every country understood citizenship as entailing both individual and social rights. Latin Americans broadened classical liberalism’s “right to life” to mean a right to a healthy life, which obligated the state to provide healthcare. “Democracy, political as well as social and economic,” wrote Hernán Santa Cruz, a childhood friend of Salvador Allende and a Chilean UN delegate who helped Eleanor Roosevelt draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, “comprises, in my mind, an indivisible whole”.That whole was shattered to pieces by the death-squad terror of the cold war, much of it patronized by Washington, followed by the free-market neoliberal economics pushed on Latin America during that war.Yet once the repression abated and citizens were free to vote their preference, they began to elect social democrats as presidents, men and women who represented a variety of historical social movements: feminists, trade unionists, peasant organizers, Indigenous rights campaigners, heterodox economists, environmentalists and liberation theologians. Today, a large majority of Latin Americans live in countries governed by the center left. Despite the best efforts of Friedrich von Hayek and his libertarian followers in the region to convince them otherwise, most Latin Americans do not believe that welfare turns citizens into serfs.Pankaj Mishra, in hissurveyof the horrors inflicted on Palestinians, has written about the “profound rupture” in the “moral history of the world” since 1945. No region has done more to heal that rupture than Latin America.And no region has had as much experience beating back fascists, long after the second world war had ended, than Latin America. Rightwing authoritarians, gripped by the same obsessions that move Trump supporters in the United States, have some momentum, though they haven’t been able to escalate occasional electoral victories, including inArgentinaand Ecuador, into a full-on continentalkulturkampf.Center-left democrats holdthe right at bay by putting forth an expansive social-democratic agenda, one flexible enough to include demands for sexual and racial equality. As the US rolls back abortion rights, momentum in Latin America moves in the other direction – Argentina, Mexico andColombiaeither decriminalizing or legalizing abortion. Gay marriage and same-sex civil unions have been recognized in 11 countries.The power and pitfalls of protest: how to speak out without falling victim to Trump’s playbook | Jonathan SmuckerRead moreSpasms of ethnonationalist rage gripped much of the world the 1990s – Indonesia’s 1998 anti-Chinese rampage, for example. In contrast, Indigenous peoples in countries including Bolivia,Ecuador, Chile and Guatemala burst into politics as the best bearers of the social democratic tradition, adding environmentalism and cultural rights to the standard menu of economic demands. Today, many countries have retreated behind an aggrieved nationalism. For the most part, Latin Americans have not. Their reaction to the depredations of corporate globalization is rarely expressed in xenophobic, antisemitic or conspiratorial tropes, as a struggle against “globalists”. Nationalism in Latin America has long been understood as a gateway to universalism.Frontline activists stand unbowed before police batons and paramilitary guns. In 2022, Latin America clocked the world’s highest murder rate of environmental activists. Unionists, students, journalists, and women’s and peasant rights activists are assassinated at a regular clip. Yet organizing continues. In Brazil during the four-year presidency of the Trump-like Jair Bolsonaro (2019-2023), theLandless Workers’ Movement, already the largest social movement in the world, grew even larger.When it comes to interstate relations, Latin America is one of the most peaceful regions. There is no nuclear competition, thanks to one of the most successful arms control treaties in history, the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.In 1945, Latin American diplomats drew on their long history in opposing Washington’s interventionism to play a key role in founding the liberal multilateral order, the global system of governance now upended by Trump. Most importantly, the region’s leaders insisted that nations should be organized around the premise of cooperation, not competition, that diplomacy should be used to settle differences, and that war should be a last resort. Their post-cold war counterparts have loudly defended these principles, first against George W Bush during the war on terror, and more recently against Joe Biden and Trump, insisting that the art of diplomacy must be relearned. “Brazil has no enemies,” the country’s defense minister once said, notable considering that the Pentagon has marked out the entire globe as a battlefield.Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Colombia’s Gustavo Petro, among others, have criticized the return to power politics and balance-of-power diplomacy. If the past teaches anything, they say, it is that opening a belligerent multi-front balance of power – with the United States pushing against China, pushing against Russia, with all countries, everywhere, angling for dominance – will lead to more confrontation, more war. As with the United States’s shapeshifting, amorphous domestic culture war, there is no clear endgame to this new era of militarized economic competition, of war by proxy and privateer, which only increases the odds of conflict spinning out of control.One need not romanticize Latin America. To recognize the strength of the social democratic ideal in Latin America does not require one to celebrate all those who call themselves socialists, in Nicaragua and Venezuela, for example. And even those we might celebrate, such as Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum or Chile’s Gabriel Boric, preside over states loaded with significant amount of repressive power, often directed at some of their country’s most vulnerable, such as Mapuche activists in southern Chile.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

Trump has transformed the United States government into a predator-state, a tormenter of citizens and non-citizens alike. Latin American social democrats – Lula in Brazil and Mexico’s Sheinbaum, Uruguay’s Yamandú Orsi, and Petro in Colombia, among others – do what they can to use state power to fulfill an obligation: the ideal that all people should live in dignity.The forcefulness in which Latin American leaders such as Lula and Sheinbaum defend social rights contrasts with the timidity of the Democratic partyThe forcefulness in which Latin American leaders such as Lula and Sheinbaum defend social rights contrasts with the timidity of the Democratic party. Biden did pass legislation suggesting it was breaking with the old neoliberal order. But Biden’s team couldn’t find its voice, unable to link a reinvestment in national industry with a renewed commitment to social citizenship.Democratsare shrill in denouncing Trump’s extremism even as they are timid in offering an alternative.Confronted with a existential crisis that people feel in their bones, the Democratic party puts forth weak-tea fixes in an enervating technocratic jargon, its counselors saying the lesson of Kamala Harris’s loss is that the party has to think even smaller, has to shake off its activist constituencies and move to the center.Arecent op-edin the New York Timesurged Democrats to lay out their own Project 2029, to counter the conservative thinktank Heritage Foundation’s influentialProject 2025. What did the author of the op-ed believe should be in this new project? A call for national healthcare? No. Affordable housing? No. Paid vacations, universal childcare or an increase in the minimum wage? None of that. He suggested that the Democrats promise to streamline regulations and improve “the quality” of “customer-service interactions”.Woodrow Wilson imagined a world without war. FDR imagined a world without fear or want. Today’s would-be governing liberals in the United States imagine nothing. They treat the promise of a humane future – or of any future at all – like a weight from the past, hard to bear, easy to toss aside.Democrats in the United States can’t simply mimic social democrats in Latin America; they operate in vastly different political contexts. But Latin America is a useful mirror, reflecting the considerable distance Democrats in the US have drifted from New Deal values. They might want to read Roosevelt’s Faith of theAmericasspeech, where he said that the best way to defuse extremism was to use government action to ensure “a more abundant life to the peoples of the whole world”.Trump is creating a selfish, miserable world. Here’s what we can do | Michael PlantRead moreLatin America social democrats today – and not the Democratic party in the United States – are the true heirs of FDR’s vision. They know that if democracy is to be something more than a heraldic device, it must confront entrenched power. Latin American reformers know that the way to beat today’s new fascists is the same as it was in the 1930s and 1940s: by welding liberalism to a forceful agenda of social rights, by promising, in a voice simple, clear and sure, to improve the material conditions of people’s lives.“People have to have hope again,” as Lulaput itin his most recent successful run for re-election, “and a full belly, with morning coffee and lunch and dinner”.What’s giving me hope nowWhat gives me hope is that in a place like Latin America, where the forces of reaction are so fierce, social movements led by feminists, peasants, first peoples, and gay and trans activists continue to fight back against fierce repression with enormous courage. Political theorists like to measure “democracy” according to institutional stability and free elections, and by that standard, many places in Latin America come up short. But if we measure democracy by courage, by a tenacity to continue to fight for universal, humane values, for a more sustainable, more equal, more human world, then Latin America carries forward the democratic ideal.Greg Grandin, the C Vann Woodward professor of history at Yale, is the author of the recently published,America, América: A New History of the New World, from which parts of this essay were based.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsFighting BackTrump administrationDonald TrumpAmericasUS politicsBrazilArgentinacommentShareReuse this content"

Some roofs face the wrong way, others are overshadowed or subject to heritage restrictions, and apartment blocks often lack space.Landlords are also often reluctant to install solar systems in rental properties since the benefits flow to the tenants rather than the property owner.So is there value in installing a battery anyway?Financial cost v environmental benefitDavid Collins, a retiree, wanted to install solar, but his roof is shaded by an old tree in the back yard.Instead, inspired by local community groupElectrify Mackellar, Collins spent $14,000 on a 15 kilowatt hour (kwh) battery. He’s saving about $100 a month on electricity bills, so his investment will take 12 years to pay off – longer than the battery’s 10-year warranty.But the resident of Sydney’s bushfire-prone Northern Beaches thinks it’s a good deal because the battery provides backup power if he’s isolated from the electricity network.“We’ve had trees come down and take out the power lines,” he says. “I wanted to be self-sufficient in case of a power outage.”View image in fullscreenDavid Collins with his 15 kilowatt hour home battery.Photograph: Fiona McDougallCollins’ retailer provides 100% renewable energy and buys back power at peak times. The battery is set to automatically draw from the grid when electricity is cheap in the middle of the day and enables Collins to sell power later when prices rise, booking a modest profit.When we speak, just after 4pm, Collins checks an app that shows his electricity price is 24 cents per kwh. “That’s quite expensive,” he says. “Earlier today I was paying nine cents.” A separate app tells him his house is now drawing power from the battery.“It’s really a brilliant system,” says Collins, though he stresses his primary motivation for getting a battery was environmental, not financial.I tried to figure out whether we could do something similar in our Melbourne apartment.Our electricity retailer offers atime-of-use tariffof 9 cents per kWh between 10am and 3pm. Outside those hours, we pay about three times as much.In theory, if we filled a battery with discount power during the middle of the day and drew on it the rest of the time, we could have non-stop cheap electricity. We’d reduce emissions, soak up excess renewable energy and ease pressure on the electricity network when demand peaks.Rough calculations show that a battery would take more than 17 years to pay for itself. Given that batteries last about 15 years, this isn’t a great deal.What subsidies are available?Labor ispromising big subsidiesfor home batteries if it wins the election, but they would only apply to households with solar panels that buy batteries that can be networked as part of a “virtual power plant”, feeding electricity into the grid to balance supply and demand in real time.TheGreensand independent MPSophie Scampsalso have household battery proposals, but the Coalition is yet to offer one.If our household qualified for Labor’s subsidy, the payback time would fall to a little over 12 years, making it closer to break-even. Double dipping with state-based home battery schemes could make it more viable still, as would selling power back into the grid.So why not extend subsidies to homes without solar?Ben McLeod, an analyst at the Climate Council, thinks it is wise to prioritise homes with solar because it is a big enough market to make a real impact.“Storing energy where it is generated and used also keeps excess power out of the grid,” he says. “That’s especially important in areas where high solar uptake is already pushing the limits on new connections.”McLeod thinks there are more cost-effective ways for households without solar to support the transition to renewable energy, such as heating hot waterduring the dayinstead of at night.What about renters?Tristan Edis, the director of the analytical and consulting firm GreenEnergyMarkets, says people who install solar panelsandbatteries are paying a share of the upfront cost of a shift to renewables that is reducing wholesale energy prices. “They help all energy consumers to a degree,” he says.The Smart Energy Council has backed aGreens’ proposalto give renters access to solar panels. It says the case for installing batteries without solar will get stronger as batteries become cheaper and more efficient.Edis says it’s also worth investigating the potential of combining portable batteries with balcony solar for renters and people living in apartments. This is popularin Germanybut faces regulatory hurdles in Australia.David Collins is keen to eventually power his battery with rooftop panels. “I would love to go completely solar,” he says. “That old tree in back yard might need to come down one day, and when that happens, I will.”Explore more on these topicsEnergyChange by degreesEnergy efficiencyRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The final round of last year’s leadership election was between two candidates from the right of the party, and since then it has beenRobert Jenrick, the more rightwing of the two, who has emerged as the party’s centre of gravity – a remarkable feat for a man who lost the race.His recently reported comments about acoalition with Reform UK(or perhaps, as sources close to him insist, its voters) have put the question of the Tories’ future direction back in the spotlight. Is Nigel Farage the herald of a fundamental rightward shift? Is this, as one fellow journalist put it to me, “the final death of one-nation Toryism”?The short answer is “probably not” – at least not unless the Tory party dies its own final death. The “one nation” labeldates back to Benjamin Disraeli; it survived the reactionary hegemony of Lord Salisbury and the revolutionary one of Margaret Thatcher. So long as there is a Tory party, it will have a left wing and, historical labels being what they are, it will probably call itself one nation.Last year’s contest would also seem, on the surface at least, to provide that wing with some bullish indicators. Broadly speaking (for personal loyalties and ambitions confound precise readings from such tallies), James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat had the support of about half the parliamentary party. It took a realfeat of self-sabotagefor neither to reach the final. Yet there can be no doubt that one-nation Conservatismisin trouble – and the root of that trouble is that it is intellectually exhausted.Consider last year’s leadership election again. Many Cleverly supporters ended up rowing in behindKemi Badenochto stop Jenrick. They knew they didn’t like the policy direction he was proposing. But the alternative was a candidate who made a virtue of having no policy direction at all and who, on issues such as immigration and the European court of human rights, is now inching towards his positions anyway.Badenoch was an opportunity to hit the snooze button on an intellectual reckoning with the past 14 years, and postponing that reckoning has been the sum of the Tory left’s ambitions since the general election.Hence nonsensical arguments such as theConservativeslost not because of any failure of doctrine, but on “competence”, two things that cannot in politics be so cleanly distinguished. Where was the incompetence on immigration, for example: promising to cut it to the tens of thousands, or failing (indeed, not really trying) to fulfil that promise?View image in fullscreen‘The ‘one nation’ label dates back to Benjamin Disraeli.’Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThe unhappy truth that capital-S “Sensible” Tory MPs must confront is that any “lurch to the right” over the past few years was almost entirely rhetorical rather than substantive, and with the exception of Brexit – which, however important you think it is, is not the root cause of our housing and energy price crises – they got what they wanted most of the time.Perhaps that feels counterintuitive, but it’s true. NHS spending increased by 25% in real terms between 2010 and 2023 without (post-Andrew Lansley) any serious effort at structural reform; more young people than ever were funnelled into higher education; immigration was allowed to rise to whatever level industry and sector lobby groups demanded; taxation levels soared.Yes, the Rwanda scheme was certainly very right-coded. But not only did Rishi Sunak bend over backwards to try – and fail – to implement it without fundamentally challenging our existing legal and treaty obligations, but the whole thing was in part a way to talk about immigration without talking aboutlegalimmigration, which Boris Johnson hadcasually doubled.This disconnect played a significant role in the Tories’ shattering defeat last year by alienating voters on all fronts; Badenoch is right to point out that the party “talked right, but governed left”, even if she cannot or will not offer any compelling explanation as to why.Perhaps the most telling evidence of this intellectual aridity is the way the Tories responded to the rise of Ukip. Like Jenrick now,Nigel Faragewas able for years to set the tempo of Conservative thinking – or at least Conservative language – on Europe and immigration; time and again, David Cameron either made promises he had no intention of keeping (net immigration to “tens of thousands”) or didn’t expect to have to keep (an in/out referendum).Some one-nation MPs certainly criticised his “pandering” in this way. But they never furnished him or his successors with an actual alternative solution to the problem of a party thatcame second in 100 seatsin 2015 and was well positioned to walk away with a critical slice of the Tory vote.Nigel Farage thinks net zero is the new Brexit. Starmer can prove him wrong | Rafael BehrRead moreAt root, the problem currently facing the one-nation Tories is, paradoxically, that they are the most small-c Conservative faction; often self-consciously non-ideological, and united around the principle that the status quo more or less works and requires only sensible adjustment to keep the ship of state on course.That is a healthy, conservative cast of mind, of course. But it can too easily ossify into a reflexive defence of the status quo, an instinctive distaste for radicalism mutating into the comforting belief that radical measures are never the answer, compounded in this case by the understandable reluctance on the part of former ministers to admit, even to themselves, to complacently presiding over systems that were slowly falling to pieces.Ultimately, the reason the right is making the policy running is that it is the only force on the field. What is the one-nation solution to mass immigration, save shoring up a Westminster consensus that allows public opinion to be safely ignored? To the looming financial apocalypses in higher education and local government? To the unsustainable trajectory of NHS and entitlement spending?I have no idea, and I write about the Conservative party for a living.It’s not that there aren’t ideas out there, intellectual threads that could be woven into a relevant one-nation philosophy and programme. But MPs have no right to grumble about their party gravitating towards Jenrick’s answers, or Farage’s, when for now they are the only people offering any.Henry Hill is deputy editor of ConservativeHomeExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionReform UKKemi BadenochRobert JenrickNigel FaragecommentShareReuse this content"

I won a historic victory in Poole forLabourlast July on the basis that things would change – and change for the better.But my constituents, already fearful ofplansfor the largestcuts to disability supportin a generation, have been getting in touch with me about new legislation that might be news to you: thegovernment is resurrectingTory proposals for mass spying on people who receive state support.The powers contained in the public authorities (fraud, error and recovery) bill quite rightly seek to tackle organised crime and online fraud, but they alsousher in new powersfor the banks to trawl through bank details of individuals – even where there is no suspicion of wrongdoing.This legislation would compel banks tocarry out financial surveillanceof welfare recipients. Given the volume of accounts involved, this will be completed by an algorithm. If the software flags a possible overpayment, whether due to fraud or error, the bank will report the individual to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for further investigation.Why should someone in receipt of benefits have fewer rights to privacy? And why are we asking banks to become an arm of the state?These new powers strip those who receive state support of a fundamental principle of British law: the presumption of innocence. By default, welfare recipients would be treated as suspects, simply because they need support from the state.The risk of aHorizon-style scandalon a massive scaleis glaringly obviouswhen millions are being monitored. It will be disabled people, carers, pensioners and the very poorest people who are impacted by wrongful investigations and forced to endure burdensome appeals to prove their innocence.It has been suggested that the powers would help identify overpayments more quickly, but the DWP already has ample data-sharing and data-matching powers at its disposal. Thecarer’s allowance scandal, when unpaid carers were plunged into debt and prosecuted for fraud because of the DWP’s own overpayments, provides an example of where the department was failing to use the access to real-time alerts of carers’ earnings they already had to stop overpayments. The government admits that if fraudsters spread assets across multiple accounts, they won’t be flagged.The bill also grants the DWP draconian powers to apply to a court to have peoplestripped of their driving licencesif they have outstanding debt, where all other attempts at recovery have failed. The government claims this will be a last resort where the debtor fails to engage with the DWP. In practice, it means officials will first attempt todeduct fundsdirectly from their bank account. To do this, they must secretly request at least three months of bank statements from a bank without informing the individual, to assess whether the deduction would cause “hardship”. If it would, the person would eventually face the threat of losing their licence. That’s not justice – it’s a poverty penalty.The so-called safeguards for vulnerable debtors are also inadequate, relying heavily on court oversight and the ability of individuals to make personal representations. This overlooks the fact that these powers only apply to those deemed not to have “engaged” with the DWP – a standard that fails to recognise how non-engagement is often a symptom of genuine hardship and the circumstances in which people find themselves, rather than any wrongdoing.Many benefit recipients live with mental health conditions, disabilities, or have caring responsibilities that make navigating complex bureaucracy extremely difficult. All these challenges will only be made worse if the government proceeds with its planned cuts to disability benefits, which willaffect over 3 million familiesand force many disabled individuals into crisis and destitution.Ill and disabled people will be made ‘invisible’ by UK benefit cuts, say expertsRead moreI have proposed amendments to this bill to ensure that only those suspected of fraud are subject to surveillance, allowing the government to target criminality without monitoring the public. I have also proposed removing the power to apply to a court to strip people of their driving licences due to debt. There are fairer and more effective ways to enforce the law.We must prevent the corruption of our welfare state into a punitive system, where the price of accessing support is the sacrifice of privacy and exposure to the uniquely cruel sanction of being stripped of mobility.The welfare state needs to wrap its arms around those who need it. It should be there for everyone, but this approach undermines public trust in the system. The change we promised must mean a more compassionate and caring society, one that enables rather than penalises. These values are what makes us different from the previous government – and we shouldn’t forget that.Neil Duncan-Jordan is the Labour MP for PooleExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionWelfareBenefitscommentShareReuse this content"

Why doesn’t the government protect them?Fri 25 Apr 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 12.32 EDTShareAt next week’s local elections, few will be voting on how their council is run. They will be passing judgment on Keir Starmer, Kemi Badenoch and other national figures. Local democracy no longer thrives in Britain. An opinion poll would be cheaper.Cut to the humble youth club. I supported a private charity in my old borough of Camden, north London, that was struggling to turn young people, mostly in their teens, away from a life of crime. The local council-run youth club had been forced to close.The charity’s triumphs are many, and its contributions to the neighbourhood have been little short of sensational. In one year, they include 300 young people guided back to school or college after a suspension, 60 who were found jobs, 205 who completed a mental health programme, 52 gang mediations and 231 knives surrendered. The charity reckons half the people it served were saved from turning to crime.This is a private venture run from a church and supported by donations and grants. Its service can only be described as utterly essential. It is answering a chronic urban need. Yet these types of services are collapsing. An Institute for Fiscal Studies report last year charted a30% fallin the number of youth centres in London between 2010 and 2019. A similar Unison survey found that1,243 council youth clubsin England and Wales closed over the austerity period, with just 581 still operating.The government boasts that it is fighting crime. It is doing so by increasing police numbersby 13,000(by 2029) and buildingfour new prisons. These prisons willcost a staggering £2.3bnand lock up 14,000 more criminals. This seems an extravagance when nothing is being done to limit crime in the first place. Britain still refuses to go down the route that even New York now takes, in licensing and regulating its cannabis market. It leaves county lines rampant. The government refuses to imitate Norway and other European countries whose prisons are primarily for rehabilitation rather than punishment. Britishreoffending ratesare more than twice as high as Norway’s. Britain breeds crime. Norway cures it.Nothing would more obviously cut crime than helping young people avoid becoming criminals. The most glaring statistic at present is that, after the pandemic, school suspensions and absencessoared by 67%. We should note that violence, burglary and car crime havefallen dramaticallyover the decades in Britain and crime hysteria is inappropriate. But exclusion from school is a surefire warning of trouble ahead. So why is it so neglected?The answer is that democracy can be a cruel taskmaster. Over the years, central government has grasped ever more functions of the welfare state, or at least the ones that carry political clout and glamour. Westminster has taken control ofhospitals,most secondary educationand now, under the present government,housing supplyandeven potholes. All these topics adorn the Commons dispatch box and win money and manifesto pledges. The prime minister behaves as if he were mayor of England.The Cinderellas left to the discretion of local councils include rubbish collection, libraries, care of the elderly and youth clubs. Since the sums spent on these functions are not ordained by central government, they were butchered by austerity after 2010. They have never recovered. The collapse of NHS hospitals has been partly attributed to the failure of the care sector. Some 800 libraries haveclosed. Youth clubs have suffered the worst, withtwo-thirdsvanishing.There are two sorts of public servant in a welfare state. There are those who live by their phones, issue orders, spend money and quantify success. And there are others who go out and make human contact with those who need them. Youth workers make it their job to befriend the lonely, who have escaped their homes on to the street. There they are vulnerable to bullying, gang membership, violence and the dark alleys of the drugs market. They must be the hardest people to help.Youth centres may seem tame places – a pool table, a boxing ring, some books, a health adviser, an ex-offender turned mentor. But they save huge amounts of money in averting that most extravagant of occupations, a life of crime and punishment. At present, Britain is everywhere seeing the closure of places of communal coming together. Churches, pubs, playing fields, police stations and high street shops are fast disappearing. The public realm is facing abandonment. Of this fate, the loss of the youth club would be most dangerous of all.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionCrimeAusterityLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

While companies are yet to respond to the demands for better pay and conditions, the mobilisation was a clear step-up for a process of national organisation that began in 2020.Between 2016 and 2021, the number of people working for delivery apps in Brazilrose by 979.8%, with the number of delivery and passenger drivers in the sector now around 1.4 million. This boom coincides with the period in which the country finally felt the effects of the post-2008 recession. Economic decline, corruption and theimpeachment of the then president, Dilma Rousseff, ended 13 years of successful left-leaning governments by the Workers’ party (PT). In the years that followed, a series of austerity measures and labour reforms were put in place, the political spectrum moved steadily to the right and the far-right libertarian politician Jair Bolsonaro was elected president in 2018.This sequence of events, and the new reality introduced by platform work, added to Brazil’s long-established tradition of informal, precarious labour – a legacy of slavery that, as sociologist Francisco de Oliveiraremarked in the early 1970s, is not so much an archaic leftover as an enabling condition for a highly unequal form of capitalist modernisation. Since the 1980s, thinkers in Brazil and abroad have spoken of the growing casualisation produced by neoliberalism as part of the ongoing “Brazilianisation of the world”.The loss of protections and rights did not, however, translate into more support for unions and leftwing parties. On the contrary, it was among the newly emerged mass of platform workers that Bolsonaro found some of his staunchest supporters. In part, this was because many blamed the crisis that led them to this kind of work on the PT. But this phenomenon, which can also be observed in Argentina with Javier Milei andelsewhere, has deeper roots.It is a long-term effect of how several decades of neoliberal domination over policy and discourse have impacted the ways in which people relate to themselves and one another. This can be described as an internalised “neoliberalism from below”, in which seeing oneself as an entrepreneur – rather than a worker, or someone who is exploited or poor – is instrumental to navigating a world in which the individual bears all risks, and for sustaining self-esteem in the face of hardship and overwork. Government regulation, from taxes to obligations put on bosses to even traffic laws, appears from this perspective as a hindrance to economic activity. Losing a car, motorbike or phone becomes an existential threat, justifying heavy policing or even carrying a weapon.All this makes the far right’s authoritarian, pro-entrepreneur, anti-organised labour message potentially appealing even to those working in the worst possible settings. Nowhere was this clearer than in the waythis cohort responded to Covid: whereas Bolsonaro’sopposition to sanitary measuresboosted his popularity, the extra-careful approach taken by Argentina’s Alberto Fernández made precarious workers more open to Milei’s hardline laissez-fairism.Although Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvadefeated Bolsonaroto return for a third term in 2022, this tide is still far from its ebb. Even worse, stubborn inflation and a lacklustre performance mean Lula has been losing ground among the country’s poorest for the first time in two decades, losing 20% approval in two monthsamong those earning less than two minimum wages.View image in fullscreenBrazilComposite: Guardian Design / Getty ImagesMaybe the attitudes of gig workers are not as generalised as they are often thought to be. A 2024 survey shows that67% of self-employed workers in Brazil would prefer a formal contract, with the number going up to 75.6% among those earning the minimum wage or less. But it is not far-fetched to see the cyclists andmotoboys(motorbike couriers) who snake their way through congested traffic as the bellwether of a broader social shift towards a more individualistic, cynical outlook. Nurtured by online coaches and theprosperity gospelof evangelical churches, it is one that is distrustful of collective solutions, and which accepts the struggle for survival as a natural fact to be gamed, not questioned.More from this seriesLoading...All of this means that, even when they organise, couriers’ politics can be ambiguous. It demands better conditions, but rejects the loss of autonomy associated with regular jobs; it slips between seeing couriers as a class and as a collection of individuals. High turnover and little collective identity mean few people stay long enough in the frontline for organisation and experience to flourish. And yet, precisely because they are so numerous and paradigmatic of the way the economy is moving – not just inBrazil, but in any country in which casualisation and platform work is thriving – finding ways to reach them is a key challenge for the left.While Brazil’sfirst one-day, decentralised national strikes by delivery driversin 2020 suggested a more readily recognisable form of class politics – with the brief emergence of the groupAntifascist Couriers(Entregadores Antifascistas) and its leader,Paulo Galo– reality has since remained obstinately hard to read. But there are interesting experiments afoot in organising workers more fairly, and away from the call of the far right.While several of theplatform cooperativesthat sprung up in the wake of the 2020 mobilisations did not last, some attempts at creating worker-owned, worker-managed delivery services, some of them with their own apps and control over data, have thrived. Among these areLiga Coop, a 2,700-member-strong federation of ride-hailing cooperatives in three states, andSeñoritas Courier, a bike courier service by cis women and trans people that has existed in São Paulo since 2017. Outside the circulation sector,Hire Those Who Struggleis a chatbot created by the Homeless Workers’ Movement (MTST) to connect people looking for services from building to education to activists who provide them.In last year’s municipal elections, the scramble for a place in the final round of São Paulo’s mayoral contest between MTST’s Guilherme Boulos, who promised rest stops for couriers where they could access basic services, and internet coach Pablo Marçal, who sells the entrepreneurial dream that lures gig workers and beyond, provided a good picture of the fight over the urban precariat. Boulos beat Marçal, but lost the head-to-head vote against the Bolsonaro-supported incumbent. The hope story, however, came from the success ofLife Beyond Work, which began as an online campaign against the six-day week common in the service sector, and has since collected almost3m signaturesin support of a bill to limit the working week to 36 hours,finally presentedin February of this year.The 30-year-old Rick Azevedo, who founded the movement while working in retail, with a TikTok video that made him into a viral sensation, was the left’s most-voted-for city counsellor in Rio de Janeiro.While having all the potential pitfalls of internet-based initiatives, the campaign felt like the first time in ages in which the politics of work was back on the agenda, and it was neither neoliberal reformers nor the far right – which struggled to find a position that did not come across as anti-worker – on the front foot. What is more, it thrived on social media, a terrain that since Bolsonaro has mostly served the right. This not only proves that there is much to be gained if the left is willing to go on the offensive, but will no doubt leave important lessons as to how that can be done.Rodrigo Nunes is a philosopher, senior lecturer at the University of Essex and author of Neither Vertical Nor Horizontal: A Theory of Political Organisation"

But what of the anxious young women going Green?Gaby HinsliffDesire for a politics that cares about global and local injustice is sharpening the political gender divideFri 25 Apr 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 08.47 EDTShareSometimes a political backlash doesn’t take the shape you expect. Though there are times when it goes off like a firework, as young men’sTikTok-fuelled surgeof enthusiasm for Nigel Farage did last summer, sometimes it’s more of a long, slow burn. The most underexplored form of revolt against mainstream politics right now is the second kind, involving not angry young men lurching rightwards but anxious young women turning, if anything, more sharply left.Almost a quarter of women aged 18 to 24voted Green last July, roughly double the number of young men who voted Reform, though predictably it’s the latter who have since got all the attention. While the big parties chased avidly after so-calledWaitrose women, well-heeled home counties matrons considering defecting from the Tories, they had little to say to their daughters. So it was the Greens who ended up cornering the market in a certain kind of frustrated gen Z voter: typically a middle-class student or graduate in her early 20s, whose conscience is pricked every time she opens Instagram by heartrending images of orphans in Gaza or refugees drowning in the Channel, and who can’t understand why nobody seems to care. She’s angry about the rampant misogyny of some boys she knew at school, Donald Trump, greedy landlords and a burning planet, and the Greens’ more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger social media posts attacking Keir Starmer for choosing welfare cuts over wealth taxes strike a chord.But deeper down, perhaps, she’s angry that despite slogging diligently through school and university and possibly a master’s (the Greens do best among the highly educated) she still can’t count on a lifestyle like her parents had. For all the girls who put their heads down and worked at school while the boys kicked off and absorbed all the teachers’ attention, there may be something grimly familiar about a Labour party that seemingly takes them for granted while bending over backwards to placate noisy Reform voters.Why isn’t this quiet form of female political alienation ringing more alarm bells?The obvious answer is that there aren’t enough of these young women to swing an election, but young Reform-voting men caught the public imagination despite being an even smaller drop in the electoral ocean. And though it would be dangerous to get complacent, detailed research on so-called “Reform-curious” voters to be published next week by the thinktank Persuasion counters some of the wilder assumptions about gen Z men’s politics, finding that while it’s true they are more likely than older male voters to think favourably of Farage, they’re less likely to actually vote Reform. Strikingly, they’re also less likely than middle-aged gen X men now to say that feminism has gone too far. Maybe it’s not just schoolboys who should be sat down andmade to watch Netflix’s Adolescence, as MPs keep arguing,but their fathers. The growing consensus meanwhile among political scientists is that if young men’s and women’s worldviews are (as polls suggest) becoming ever morestarkly polarised, the driving force behind that split is women becoming sharply more liberal, not men becoming radically more rightwing.Rosie Campbell, professor of politics at King’s College London, is one of surprisingly few academics to have dug deeper into younger women’s political choices. For a start, it looks as if earlier waves of feminism have been the left’s unexpected recruiting sergeant: the historic trend is for women to become more liberal as more of them go to university or move into the labour market, and 57% of British university studentsare now female. But Campbell’s hunch is that young women’s radicalisation also has a lot to do with Brexit and its unfolding consequences. Women are noticeably more anti-austerity and pro-remain than men, she points out, which suggests they’re likely to have found the past nine years more frustrating.As the two biggest parties fell over themselves to embrace Brexit and then to rule out big wealth taxes, these women are likely to have been pushed further and further out to the political fringes. Alongside her colleague Rosalind Shorrocks, Campbell traces the start of the Green surge back to a pool of young female voters attracted by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of a “kinder, gentler politics”, who backed Labour in 2017 and then voted Green in the following set of European elections, and are unlikely now to be enthused by Starmer explaining why he no longer believes trans women are women. The final piece of the jigsaw, she suspects, may be social media: are the same algorithms blamed for leading young men down rightwing rabbit holes similarly reinforcing young women’s anger at social injustices, by feeding them an endless diet of the content they seem to click on most? If so, the gap between gen Z men and women is likely to grow, with consequences not just for politics but for the lives they may end up living alongside each other.Perhaps there will never be enough of them to count electorally. Or perhaps their furious idealism will simply fade with age. But the failure even to be curious about what it is young women are trying to say, just because their chosen revolt against the mainstream takes a less aggressive or destructive form than young Reformers’, feels profoundly unfair. Sometimes it pays to listen to people sitting quietly at the back, not just the ones screaming in your face.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPoliticsOpinionReform UKGreen partyWomenMenYoung peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

The question is famously difficult to answer. But we can be reasonably confident that if the successful contender comes from the traditionalist camp – as opposed to the reformists – then he is likely to be Hungary’s most senior bishop, Péter Erdő.If you follow Hungarian politics then you will know of Erdő – a highly cultured man, respected for his broad learning well beyond his specialism in church law. His expertise has made him avalued consultantto Vatican bodies, while his sermons and interviews abound with historical and literary references. Yet he’s also a remote figure, lacking the common touch that defined Francis’s papacy; ascetic-looking, he’s rarely pictured smiling.His links to his country’s far-right Fidesz government should, however, warn us about the risks of his possible election.Erdő has been archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest and a cardinal since 2003. He first developed an international profile by leading the Council of the Bishops’ Conferences of Europe, the representative body for Europe’s Catholic bishops. Latterly, he’s gained a stronger standing outside Europe, especially among traditionally minded African and American bishops. This builds on his role as rapporteur for the global Synod on the Family (2014-15), convoked byPope Francisto reflect on the church’s pastoral teaching in the light of changing social conditions.During the synod he resisted moves towards a more inclusive approach to LGBTQ+ and divorced Catholics: “The current tendency to pass off those things which are simply desires, often selfish ones, as true and proper rights … must be avoided,” he told delegatesin a keynote speech.Vatican-watchers differ on the viability of his candidacy. Conservatives certainly like him. Erdő, however, has been spoken of as a contender before, in 2013, ahead of the conclave that elected Pope Francis. On that occasion he was eliminated early, leaving some commentators sceptical of his present candidacy.Yet there are important differences between then and now. In February 2013, Erdő was 60, generally reckoned too young for the job. Today, at 72, he’s in the “sweet spot”, able to offer the church a decade or more of stable governance without risking the stasis of a generational papacy such as John Paul II’s (1978-2005). Erdő could also ride a wave of traditionalist pushback against Francis’s reforms – just as Francis did with a progressive reaction to Benedict XVI’s pontificate (2005-2013).Nevertheless, despite his conservative views, Erdő’s use of cautious and moderate language makes him notably less controversial than other leading traditionalists, such as Robert Sarah. He can thus position himself as a compromise candidate: “He is conservative but not reactionary, and comes across as both pragmatic and diplomatic,” notes the Hungarian Catholic journalist Zoltán Laky.It would, however, be a mistake to be swayed by Erdő‘s apparent moderation. Although not as intimate with Hungary’s far-right premier, Viktor Orbán, as some other bishops, Erdő has nonetheless cultivated a close partnership with the governing Fidesz party since 2010.Generous subsidiesfor the church have been a plank of Fidesz’s policy.One (now-ex) cleric from Erdő’s diocese who became known for expressing dissenting views, András Hodász,claimed that“I was confronted from above” and told “not to say such things because the church would not get [financial] support”. In September 2023, Erdő was seen by many to cross a lineby attendingthe annual Kötcse picnic, a high-profile but exclusive event for Fidesz insiders during which Orbán gives a confidential briefing about the party’s policy direction in the coming year.During the migration crisis in the mid-2010s, Erdő declined to criticise Fidesz’s hate campaign against migrants. In 2017, heabruptly terminateda live TV interview when asked if the government’s vilification of asylum-seekers was compatible with Catholic teaching on compassion for such people. He has also been mute in the face of thede factocriminalisation of homelessnessin Hungary in 2018, and the introduction of Russian-style legislationstigmatising the LGBTQ+community in 2021.Potentially more troubling than Erdő’s silences about public issues are signs of past mishandling of allegations of child sexual abuse by clergy, most particularly the case of abuse survivor Attila Pető. Pető’s complaint led to the unfrocking of a priest who had abused dozens of children. His demands for an apology from the church were, however, met by legal action from diocesan officials. Last month, Snap (Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests)lodged a complaintwith the Vatican alleging that Erdő’s conduct in the matter had “harmed the vulnerable and caused scandal” in breach of the church’s own legal code.Cardinal Erdő’s office did not reply to an approach for comment for this article. Previously, ina 2021 interviewwith Válasz Online,he distanced himself from the legal action against Pető, saying that it was a private matter for the diocesan officials concerned. “We even owe this man a debt of gratitude,” he added. In March 2025, a diocesan spokesperson responded to the Snap complaintby tellingthe Hungarian outlet Telexthat the diocese believed its handling of the matter to have been timely and appropriate.Erdő’s possible ascent to the papal throne would be bad news for LGBTQ+ Catholics, and those who have remarried after divorce. It should, however, also worry abuse survivors and anyone concerned with the integrity of Christianity’s presence in public life.The church has a duty to challenge those in power when they exceed their proper authority or weaponise appeals to “Christian identity” for political ends. This is a task in which, as Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, Péter Erdő has failed miserably: there’s little reason to think that as pope he’d do any better.Alex Faludy is a British-Hungarian freelance journalist based in Budapest, specialising in religious affairsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then Cyclone Alfred swung in toward southern Queensland and the election was delayed. Damn it! The tickets were non-refundable but – thank Buddha! – my presence is no longer required on the campaign planes and buses. A nod from the boss, and away I slunk.Yes, this is Australia’s cost-of-living election – but where do the parties stand on other key policies?Read moreSo it is that, for the first time in decades, I am consuming this election like most voters – intermittently through media, social and otherwise, and only when I can’t avoid it.From this distance it is even clearer what was obvious at home. This is the most dismal election in decades. Far better to televise the papal conclave. At least dramatists have seen potential in that.Only one line stays in my mind. Peter Dutton tellingAnthony Albanesethat he couldn’t lie straight in bed. It sticks because it is true. Throughout this campaign, the prime minister has held up a Medicare card, telling the good voters that under Labor they will need only the green card, not their credit card, to see a doctor. And every single Australian already knows that is not true.But Dutton’s offerings, once stretched across the Sealy Posturepedic, are no less bent. A nuclear policy whose costings demand mass shrinkage in industrial energy use; a defence spend that will depend on higher income taxes, as Dutton simultaneously claims an “aspiration” to index tax bands to manage the effects of bracket creep. (Tbh, Labor is not even pretending to consider that most basic piece of tax reform).3:52Crashing into the election’s final fortnight like a truck hitting an early voting centre – videoLabor, so we learn daily from the polls, will come home on 3 May. At worst it should have enough to cobble up a minority government without Albanese and Adam Bandt having to walk down the aisle. Though that I would like to see.All usual caveats. Anything can happen. Many remain undecided or soft (why wouldn’t they be?). Et cetera.The depth of dismality (my word, but feel free to use it) stems from this: Albanese and Dutton, and a reasonable proportion of the people around them, know that Australia is slowly being cooked. They know that without fundamental, sensible reforms, Australia is on the early stages of the structural path that leads ultimately towards the malaise that has befallen America. Albanese, Dutton and those around them have concluded that pushing said reforms presents risks to their current employment or their hopes of future advances.Call that modern politics. Former Treasurer secretary Ken Henry calls it a“wilful act of bastardry”. And he’s right to call it intergenerational robbery.So we mark time.Unless the incoming pope declares Catholicism compulsory and birth controlverboten, Australia will never again be a society that is not weighted towards the aged. Jobs in the care economy, often taken up by migrants from poorer countries, are important jobs. But despite important pay increases supported by Labor, they remain relatively lowly paid. The people working them face a potential lifetime of being cut out of the heavily distorted housing market.

Yup.Trump’s rise in America comes from a series of fundamental societal shifts. For decades the American “heartland” was dying, a trend accelerated by the shift – “offshoring” – of manufacturing to China, to Mexico and elsewhere. Between 2010 and 2020, the US census records more than half the counties in America LOST population. That drift was largest in the so-called red states – traditional Republican party country in the midwest, great plains and the south.The Trump contest was played out most obviously with the Democrats, but the political movement most extinguished were traditional, conservative Republicans. They are now almost gone from American public life. What drives the “Make America Great Again” movement, for all its contradictions and follies, is the restoration of hope in lives that had lost it. That hope will take some time to crumble before Americans realise the postwar manufacturing boom is never coming back, no matter what self-defeating games Trump plays with tariffs.This is not to make a case for Trump but to sound a warning. Australia is engaged in a structural drift that will divide us into the property-holding and property-deprived classes. None of the political offerings does more than play with the edges, and half of them – super for deposits, shared equity schemes, etc – simply add to the demand side, pushing prices still higher.Once that hope is lost, the ground will become ripe for populism, and divisions will start to bake in. The time to get moving is now. But it is already clear 2025 is not the year, or the cycle, that will see it happen.Sometimes taking a break is useful, just to see what’s staring you in the face.Hugh Riminton is national affairs editor at Channel 10Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025OpinionAustralian politicsAnthony AlbanesePeter DuttoncommentShareReuse this content"

They stand for unity over divisionKaty HesselFri 25 Apr 2025 13.01 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 13.25 EDTShareIn 2022, two wooden sculptures stood on the riverbanks of Brooklyn. Configured as bodies with multiple heads, the monumental works – part of a larger group titled Agali Awamu, which translates as “Togetherness” – towered over those who interacted with them. They appeared as an antidote to the silver, white or green reflective buildings that stood behind them: hand-carved and human-like, with mouths that appeared to be singing or whistling, and eyes barely open, perhaps to signify a joyous introspection. While one was made up of two bodies conjoined at the hip, the other had billowing hair and carried faces on its back and belly, which seemed to be singing in harmony. The sculptures looked peaceful, and protective of each other and of those who walked past them.From far away these figures, created by the Ugandan-born, New York-based artist Leilah Babirye, looked regal. They stood tall, adorned with glistening belts and jewellery. But up close, you noticed that their ornaments were made up of rusty chains, old wire, used bolts and bicycle parts – objects once discarded, deemed as meaningless, but whose beauty had been noticed by the artist. She reused them for a celebratory monument of power and protection.View image in fullscreenValuing what’s thrown away … Leilah Babirye in 2022.Photograph: David Benthal/BFA.com/ShutterstockBabirye is known for recycling discarded items for her sculptures. Consider it a metaphor for how she and her LGBTQ+ community have been treated in her native Uganda, where being queer is still punishable by death. After the country’s anti-homosexuality bill was passed in 2013, and the artist was publicly outed in the homophobic Ugandan press, Babirye fled to the US to seek asylum, having initially been awarded a residency on Fire Island, New York.Using art to upend negative stereotypes and challenge dismissive remarks, Babirye’s huge sculptures stand up to the silencing of her communities, transforming rubbish into a site of possibility: recycling pens and bottle-caps to make a crown; evoking long hair with an old bike chain.“When you look at trash, it’s something that everybody throws out,” she told me. “It’s something that doesn’t hold any value any more to a person who considers it trash at that particular time […] So the only way to bring the value of us – the ‘trash’ – is by showing how important we are, how vocal we can be, how professional we can be, and how talented we are.”View image in fullscreenPart of the exhibition Leilah Babirye: We Have a History in San Francisco in 2024.Photograph: Gary Sexton/courtesy of the Fine Arts Museums of San FranciscoI thought of Babirye’s sculptures – that can range from single heads and talismans to giant ceramic clan-like communities – in the wake of the UK supreme court’s ruling that trans women are not recognised as women, nor trans men as men, under the 2010 Equality Act. The judgment has not only caused distraction from other urgent court rulings and news, but will inflate culture wars and boost violence towards an already extremely vulnerable group who make up less than 1% of the population.Trans communities have existed, and always will. It’s more important than ever to champion, promote and celebrate themThe ruling will surely have a detrimental health and emotional impact on trans and non-binary people, and could force public organisations to change their policies on inclusion and single-sex spaces in ways that puts trans people at risk. But, as the artist Victoria Cantons reminds me, the decision is also “a gateway for more control on women” and will “push women’s and men’s roles into more binary structures, which will be detrimental for women’s rights in general”. She also pointed out that not a single trans group was even heard on the panel before the decision was made.Shot through the heart: when it comes to expressing love, only art can do it justiceRead moreWhile our prime minister and government have become increasingly hostile to trans rights since being elected, the fact is that trans communities have existed, and always will. It’s more important than ever to champion, promote and celebrate them – echoing the spirit oflast weekend’s protests, which were peacefuland full of love.Art can be a powerful way to promote the voices of those who aren’t being heard in society, but also as a tool for helping us see the beauty, possibility and basic humanity in each other.I am reminded of something that the artist Martha Rosler – who, like Babirye, works in collage, assembling images and objects that create new possibilities – once told me: “This habit of division, of breaking things apart, holds us back from being whole people, and from building a whole society. On this spinning blue marble we all share, there is no ‘here’ or ‘there’. As a species, our destinies are increasingly intertwined: we are one. Cooperation isn’t just wise; it’s essential.

How did that happen? It doesn’t seem long ago that I was sitting on a translucent orangeinflatable sofa, clad in jeans so baggy that you could fit your entire face in one leghole, Discman in hand, wondering what the next century might bring. Time really does slip by quickly, doesn’t it?On the other hand, quite a lot has been stuffed into those 25 years, politically, technologically, environmentally and, of course, culturally. Now seems a good time to take stock. Once a month over the next three months we’ll be looking at how music, TV and film have evolved since 2000, as seen through the most popular songs, shows and movies – the pop in pop culture. In July, we’ll be sharing our favourite culture of the 21st century so far to coincide with the 200th issue of this newsletter.We’ll start with music, a medium that has been upturned more than maybe any other in the past 25 years. We’ll be trying to understand how that happened via the No 1 selling UK single of each year, seeing how tastes shift as the 00s give way to the 10s and then the 20s.To help make sense of it all, I spoke to music journalist Michael Cragg. As the author of one of the best music books of recent years, the oral history of turn-of-the-century British popReach for the Stars, Michael is better placed than most (and definitely me) to explain how popular music’s tectonic plates have shifted. Here then are the biggest selling singles of each year from 2020 onwards, and what they tell us about how music has changed in that time.The full list2000| Can We Fix It? – Bob the Builder2001| It Wasn’t Me – Shaggy featuring Rikrok2002| Anything Is Possible/Evergreen – Will Young2003| Where Is the Love? – The Black Eyed Peas2004| Do They Know It’s Christmas? – Band Aid 202005| Is This the Way to Amarillo – Tony Christie featuring Peter Kay2006| Crazy – Gnarls Barkley2007| Bleeding Love – Leona Lewis2008| Hallelujah – Alexandra Burke2009| Poker Face – Lady Gaga2010| Love the Way You Lie – Eminem featuring Rihanna2011| Someone like You – Adele2012| Somebody That I Used to Know – Gotye featuring Kimbra2013| Blurred Lines – Robin Thicke featuring TI and Pharrell Williams2014| Happy – Pharrell Williams2015| Uptown Funk – Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars2016| One Dance – Drake featuring Wizkid & Kyla2017| Shape of You – Ed Sheeran2018| One Kiss – Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa2019| Someone You Loved – Lewis Capaldi2020| Blinding Lights – The Weeknd2021| Bad Habits – Ed Sheeran2022| As It Was – Harry Styles2023| Flowers – Miley Cyrus2024| Stick Season –Noah KahanStreamingchanged everythingView image in fullscreenA Spotify banner adorns the facade of the New York Stock Exchange, 2018.Photograph: Richard Drew/APThe most significant year in this list is 2014: when the UK chart companychanged their calculations, including streaming numbers alongside physical sales to more accurately represent changing listening habits. That shift, says Michael, can be seen in the sorts of songs on this list before and after that big bang.“It’s interesting that pre-streaming, the biggest songs on the list are often linked to a sense of monoculture, be it the dominance of TV talent shows like The X Factor, or the anniversary of Band Aid and how that would have captured people’s collective imaginations.” Often buying these singles, felt like a cause: “having watched a contestant on a TV talent show for 10 weeks, you then want to buy the CD in order to help them achieve their dreams.”In the years since, the list aligns closely to the biggest songs on streaming platforms: four of the top five of Spotify’s most listened to songs appear on this list (Blinding Lights, Shape of You, Someone You Loved and As It Was). But is number of streams really the best metric of popularity? After all, says Michael, in the age of endlessly self-recycling playlists, “you may listen to a song and not really know who sings it, or care who sings it. Are people as invested in those artists as they were now that they pay a tenner a month for all music?”Genre has become less importantWhat’s striking about the list is perhaps what is absent: rock music, as you might expect of a scene that people regularly declare dead, isn’t anywhere to be seen. And the list is light on dance music, bar an appearance from Calvin Harris, and rap – particularly UK rap – feels under-represented too. (“It’s surprising that a song like Dave and Central Cee’sSprinterdoesn’t appear, but 1.3 million sales isn’t too shabby”, says Michael.)In fact “genre” as a whole seems largely absent from the list, perhaps underscoring the magpie nature of pop music in the streaming age, where artists incorporate multiple influences into their sound. Some of the later songs, says Michael “almost act as placeholders for lots of genres and sub-genres that don’t appear. Shape of You, which was originally written for Rihanna, has a hint of dancehall and tropical house, as of course does Drake’s One Dance the year before.”Of course music has also become more globalised in that time, with non-English language artists becoming huge in the west. That though isn’t quite reflected in the most popular songs list. “I’m surprised we’re not seeing a big Latin pop breakthrough hit, or a K-pop one – something that speaks to the fact that pop has opened out beyond the Anglosphere in the last few years”, says Michael.The rise of the individualskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Otherwise it’ssolo artists, or collaborations between solo artists, all the way down.The dominance of TV talent shows definitely skews this, says Michael. “No band won the X Factor until Little Mix in 2011. Then later you have the dominance of streaming, which encourages collaboration but ideally between two massively successful solo acts, like Dua Lipa (above) and Calvin Harris.” That post-genre landscape also suits solo artists, “who are able to flit more easily between genres”, over bands, who “tend to be in a specific genre lane, which doesn’t help with playlisting.… and of the ‘new boring’It’s hard not to notice the plethora of beige on our list: a whitewashing of singer-songwriters offering up syrupy ballads – Adele, Capaldi, Sheeran et al. The criticPeter Robinsoncoined a term for this music – The new boring – back in 2011, and it shows little sign of slowing more than a decade on.“The pop characters – the Gagas, the Rihannas, the Bob the Builders, start to fade away,” notes Michael. “Instead we’re left with nicely melodic but playlist-bland weepies that don’t demand that much attention. Even the Harry Styles and Miley Cyrus songs are towards the blander end of their respective outputs.”Who sums up 21st-century pop?For all the recognisable names on this list there are some striking absences: One Direction (though they are represented by Styles), Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift. Which isn’t to say that those artists are somehow less popular than assumed, but rather that their popularity can be measured in other ways, through touring, perhaps. In the case of Swift, says Michael, “her main dominance comes via album sales, where physical product is all-important and she can sell 26 variants of one album.”Discounting those absent big beasts, I ask Michael who on the list he feels sums up 21st-century popular music the best. His answer, perhaps inevitably, is Ed Sheeran, who he describes as a “streaming native”, his popularity having coincided with the rise of Spotify.“Sheeran appearing twice makes sense, especially when you think of the streaming era,” says Michael. “Looking at the pattern he seems to have the biggest song every four years – so 2025’s crown could be his for the taking.”Ed Sheeran haters: your long nightmare is not yet over, it seems.If you want to read the complete version of this newsletterplease subscribeto receive The Guide in your inbox every FridayExplore more on these topicsCultureThe Guide newsletternewslettersShareReuse this content"

Lenin and Stalin, their faces’ photographs fixed on jerky figures made from scraps, transforming sporadically into living dancers hidden under collaged costumes, monstrously dominate a puppet cast that also includes the bullish-looking but revolutionary poet Vladimir Mayakovsky along with Trotsky and Shostakovich himself.It would be stirring in an art gallery with recorded music, but on a big screen in the Royal Festival Hall above Marin Alsop conducting a gripping performance by the Philharmonia Orchestra as part of the Southbank’s Centre’smultidisciplinary Multitudes festival, it became a magic key to both the music and the age of betrayal and mass murder it witnesses.The brilliance of Kentridge’s film is that it makes you feel the majesty and pathos of this music from the darkest times of the 20th centuryShostakovich said of his 10th Symphony, “It’s about Stalin and the Stalin years” – as blunt an explanation of a work you’re ever likely to hear from a composer. It was premiered in December 1953 following Stalin’s death in March that year, freeing Shostakovich and other musicians from the dictator’s unbearably attentive grip – except poor Prokofiev, who died the same day as Stalin. So many had died, including Kentridge’s artistic hero Mayakovsky, who shot himself in 1930 as illusions collapsed about Stalin’s meat-factory regime.Biographers and musicologists argue over Shostakovich’s apparently political symphony – did he write it all after Stalin died? The brilliance of Kentridge’s film, perfectly in sync with each unnerving crescendo and melancholy trough, is that it makes you see through such quibbles and feel the majesty and pathos of this music from the darkest times of the 20th century.View image in fullscreen‘A magic key to both the music and the age of betrayal and mass murder it witnesses.’ Oh to Believe in Another World at the Royal Festival Hall, London.Photograph: Pete WoodheadThe crux of discomfort came in the painfully fast second movement alongside rapidly edited, montage-manic images and proclamations such as “Comrade life, march faster!” and “We’ll chase humanity into happiness with an iron fist!” These futuristic lines by Mayakovsky became all too bloodily real when Stalin started the Five-Year Plans in 1928, to speed up economic history by enforced collectivisation and slave labour, along with purges that killed millions.Kentridge’s film opens with lyrical photographs of revolutionary crowds in 1917, but more and more faces are then ringed with pen as if marked by Stalin for death. As the title implies, his film sees the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in 1917 as the birth of a failed utopia, but a failed utopia is still a glimpse of hope.Archival discoveries after the fall of the USSR have revealed a bleaker picture of Lenin and his party. But the artists inspired by 1917 certainly did think they were building utopia and it is their aesthetic disruptions, from Mayakovsky’s futurist lines to the art of Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitzky and Kazimir Malevich and the radical film editing of Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov that give Kentridge’s film its energy.But it’s all ironised. A hand reaches into the Museum of Stalinism to reveal this immersive, labyrinthine space is actually just a small model made from cardboard. All the brave pronouncements are the jerky bombast of tiny puppets. And it ends in a graveyard. In the same way, echoes of modernist music in Shostakovich’s 10th Symphony are framed by quotation marks. You are left with an infinitely sad and traumatised lyricism as Shostakovich and Kentridge remember the millions of Russians, Ukrainians and other nationalities slaughtered by the world’s first Communist state between 1917 and 1953. The multitudes.Southbank Centre’s Multitudes festival continues until 3 May.Explore more on these topicsWilliam KentridgeClassical musicThe Philharmonia OrchestraArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Or when it emerged that a freshLord of the Ringssaga was, through some kind of Gandalfian wizardry, being squeezed on to the small screen, the reaction was one of giddy awe. Even the faintest whisper of another trip to Hogwarts would have set the whole internet ablaze. And now? Well, here’s a test: there’s a new Harry Potter series coming out soon. How does that make you feel? Exactly.There’s no doubt about it – a worrying number of what used to be the world’s most untouchable franchises are in trouble. But how did they arrive at this point of terminal audience ennui? And is there any route for them back into our hearts?Harry PotterView image in fullscreenThe OGs … (from left) Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyThe problem:even more Potter? You cannot be SiriusSince HBO announced its new, apparently very exciting and definitely necessary adaptation of JK Rowling’s books,starring John Lithgow as Dumbledore, Paapa Essiedu as Snape and Nick Frost as Hagrid, reaction has been more muted than they were perhaps hoping. Despite that excellent cast, and even putting aside the author’s own personal journey from Hufflepuff to Slytherin, it isn’t hard to see why. Since the film series ended in 2011, we’ve had three Fantastic Beasts movies, a perennial stage play, more video games than you can waggle a Horcrux at and, for reasons no one adequately explained, a baking show. The boy who lived is still everywhere – there’s probably one of the films on ITV2 right now, go and check. See? Told you. If there is to be a tipping point that sends the already wobbly house of cards toppling over for good, a pointless TV reboot feels as though it could be it.The solution: a transmogrify spell!To justify its own existence, Potter the series needs to be recklessly brave, utterly unrecognisable from what came before – a departure of such magnitude that the movies are thereafter considered a quaint trial run from a more innocent age. Imagine a full-blown supernatural horror, blood and guts and swearing and all, set in the scariest haunted house imaginable: a creepy old school in which Dick Solomon from 3rd Rock from the Sun has a distressingly large beard. Every episode should be directed by a different horror auteur – Mike Flanagan, Coralie Fargeat, Osgood Perkins. Children may be traumatised; this could prove to be a costly failure. But imagine if it wasn’t.Imagine it.Star WarsView image in fullscreenSaber rattling … Rosario Dawson in Ahsoka.Photograph: Lucasfilm LtdThe problem:it finds your lack of faith disturbingAfter Disney splashed $4.05bn (£2.5bn) on the brand in 2012, it was clear that it would need to milk that cash cow for every last drop. And lo, after five rushed-out movies came a slew of TV shows:The Mandalorian,The Book of Boba Fett,Obi-Wan Kenobi,Andor,Ahsoka,The Acolyte,Skeleton Crew– and those were just the live-action ones. If you were a card-carrying Star Wars nerd, this was fantastic. You had a deep understanding of what was going on in each show. But casual viewers – somehow expected to know and care that Rosario Dawson was Darth Vader’s old apprentice in Ahsoka, for instance – were left baffled. Shockingly, catering exclusively to the diehards ended up putting a lot of people off. The Acolyte was swiftly cancelled amid an unedifying if sadly predictable flurry of racism and misogyny directed at its lead, Amandla Stenberg; then Skeleton Crew, despite essentially being Space Goonies with Jude Law as Sloth, debuted toeven worse ratingsthan that. Beyond Andor’s second and final season, which if it’s even half as good as the first will still be essential viewing, everyone’s got a very bad feeling about this.The solution: go far, far awayEven Star Wars’s biggest devotees must admit that the brand needs to be rested. And when it comes back, it cannot continue to demand that audiences have a PhD in advanced convention attendance to understand who everybody is, where they are, what they’re doing and why. People have jobs, other interests, families. Disney needs to operate a strict policy of one show at a time, and pour every resource into it; a new, accessible, unmissable story. No more prequels. No more reliance on exclusionary, esoteric lore. Make something good and people will come: Band of Brothers in space; Natasha Lyonne as a wisecracking podracer; Breaking Bad but with strung-out Ewoks – it really isn’t that hard.The Lord of the RingsView image in fullscreenBored of the rings … Owain Arthur and Sophia Nomvete in The Rings of Power.Photograph: Prime VideoThe problem:it’s as dull as Bilbo’s butter knifeWhen the prequel to The Lord of the Rings,The Rings of Power, debuted in 2022, opinion was divided between “spectacular, wow, just wow” and “so dull it made all my children cry”. Both opinions were correct. None of this was helped by top-o’-the-morning accents that were somehow equally offensive to hobbits and the Irish, and the unavoidable influence of “prequelitis”, the tension-robbing knowledge of who lives and who dies – so really, who cares what happens? Last year’s comparatively spry, action-packed second season, with nary a culturally insensitive harfoot in sight, was an improvement, but by then the damage was done: reports put the drop-off in viewership between the first and second seasons at an eye-watering60%. At a cost of £50m an episode, this isn’t a trend even Amazon can sustain for long. Something has to give.The solution: reforge the Rings of PowerPlenty of shows, from The Office to Parks and Recreation, went on to thrive after a duff first season. They did, however, hit the ground running in season two in a way The Rings of Power didn’t, making the hill it needs to climb that much steeper. What’s required here is something more drastic: a soft reboot. Keep the cast, characters and broad narrative of The Rings of Power, but change the name to something cool – The War of the Rings? – and pitch the third season as a new(ish) tale that requires no prior knowledge. Thrust newcomers headlong into the battle between good and evil The Rings of Power has been languidly leading up to. Sauron’s bad. Gandalf’s good. People will pick that up. Treat The Rings of Power as an optional prequel, make this “new” show propulsive and addictive, and boom: you’ve got the world’s first $1bn sleeper hit on your hands.Stranger ThingsView image in fullscreenInferno … Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things.Photograph: NetflixThe problem: my, how you’ve grownThe final season of the Duffer Brothers’adolescent-culling megasmasharrives this autumn, and every sentient being in the observable universe is going to watch it, so this is hardly a franchise on the ropes in terms of popularity. But its legacy? That is on far shakier ground. Each successive series has been bigger, more ambitious, more outlandish than the last, culminating in season four’s crop of bumper-length episodes (the finale was a bum-numbing two-and-a-half hours). It was loud and exciting but bloated, confusing, not remotely scary, and so far removed from the focused Spielbergian chills of the first season that, side by side, they are completely different shows. For all its fireworks, and beyond the unexpected Kate Bush renaissance and the death of a certain Metallica-loving perm enthusiast,season fourwas a flabby, wayward mess. Season five has been described by star Maya Hawke as “basically eight movies”. Oh dear.The solution: flip everything back upside-downThe only way to guarantee the show bows out on a high is for it to return to where it all began: a back-to-basics horror story akin to season one – the tight, intimate spooks that got everyone hooked in the first place. If it is indeed “eight movies”, make them eight suburban horror tales, scarier and nastier than they have any real reason to be. Let us look back onStranger Thingsas it was – the scrappy, retro creep-em-up that conquered the planet, not the overblown apocalyptic epic it swelled into. More importantly, and for the love of God, please give Barb the long-overdue justice she deserves.MarvelView image in fullscreenIs she even canon? … Tatiana Maslany in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law.Photograph: APThe problem: no one has the faintest clue what’shappeningWhich multiverse is the correct one? Is it the one we’re in right now? Or is this another dream/simulation? What phase even is it? Post-Endgame? Pre? Wait, who’s that? Oh, it’s wossname, that one there, your fella, with the shiny hat,Loki… no wait … is it? … Captain America …? … No, that’s … isShe-Hulkeven canon, or is it like Deadpool? … tired … confused … everyone’s so very, very confused …The solution: a click of the fingersArbitrarily cancel 50% of all in-development Marvel shows. Then bring back the brilliantJessica Jones, you cowards. Done. Next.Star TrekView image in fullscreenLive long and prosper! … Ethan Peck as Spock in Strange New Worlds.Photograph: TCD/AlamyThe problem: against cancellation, resistance is futileTrek’s faithful have faced some choppy, erm, space over the past eight years. They’ve hadStar Trek: Discovery(good, then so-so, then cancelled), Strange New Worlds (good, then better, not yet cancelled),Lower Decks(great, cancelled), Prodigy (great, cancelled),Picard(so-so, cringe, excellent, a dignified exit) and the recent TV movie,Section 31(like watching the smell of sick). In addition to the lone survivor, Strange New Worlds, there is the upcoming, Holly Hunter-starring Starfleet Academy (TBD). Based on what’s gone before, you wouldn’t bet on either of them lasting long.The solution: to boldly go where Trek has been before – Netflix and Prime VideoModern Trek shows are big, shiny, expensive things. Such endeavours clearly need to cast their net as widely as possible, and the relatively niche Paramount+ simply is not an environment in which they can do that. All those cancelled shows, even the animated Prodigy and Lower Decks, were scuttled because their audiences simply weren’t solid enough to warrant their production costs. Discovery was more than £6m an episode. But Picard debuted on Prime Video. Discovery was on Netflix before ViacomCBS, now Paramount Global,bought back the rightsin 2021. Prodigy is on Netflix right now. This isn’t a massive stretch. In order for Trek to live long and prosper, Paramount has to suck it up, sign another co-production deal with one of these, and get Trek beamed back into as many living rooms as possible. Only then might it Klingon (so very, very sorry).Game of ThronesView image in fullscreenOnce upon a time … Emma D’Arcy as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen in House of the Dragon.Photograph: Ollie Upton/HBO/PAThe problem:Westeros? More like WesterozzzzzzNo need for a spoiler alert regarding the events of season two of Thrones spin-offHouse of the Dragon, because there weren’t any. A family, all of whom have identical hair and the same name, talk about having a war with another family, all of whom have identical hair and the same name. A dragon commits fratricide. Matt Smith has some dreams in a bed. That’s it. The show has now spent 18 episodes apparently leading up to something thrilling, but if you were asked to name five gobsmacking moments, could you really say yes?The solution: reclaim the water coolerThe original Thrones was essential appointment TV the likes of which we may never see again; something you couldn’t wait to talk to someone –anyone, friend, stranger, foe, alarmed man at bus stop – about. The Red Wedding blew minds. Spoilers ended lifelong friendships. People held viewing parties for season finales, and named their kids after characters who went on to have sex with blood relatives, or become mass-murdering maniacs, or both.House of the Dragonis a decent fantasy drama, nothing more. It’s too far gone to turn things round on its own. There’s another spin-off due later this year – A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms – and it’s this that bears the weight of the entire Thrones brand on its shoulders. If it can somehow rebottle the lightning that made the series a global smash – Betrayals! Twists! Deaths! Surprises!Things actually happening!– it could restoke the fire in the bellies of millions of lapsed Westeros obsessives. It is, however, based on a series of novellas called Tales of Dunk and Egg. Things aren’t looking all that promising, to be honest.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStar Trek (Culture)Game of ThronesHouse of the DragonHarry PotterStar Trek (Film)Stranger ThingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s reflecting the way they’ve taught us back at them.”Tinā follows Mareta Percival, a choir teacher grieving her daughter’s death in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, who begins working at an elite, predominantly white private school. Despite racist opposition from the school’s leaders, she starts a school choir, changing the lives of her students as they work towards a real-life high school competition inNew Zealandcalled The Big Sing. It’s a big-hearted tear-jerker about the power of art – and it’s already breaking records in its home country, where it’s received the widest-ever release for a local film and become the sixth-highest grossing New Zealand film of all time.At its Auckland premiere at the Civic Theatre, the standing ovation continued until the credits had finished rolling. Polataivao – alongside writer, producer and director Miki Magasiva – has been overwhelmed by the response, hearing countless stories of people returning to the cinema with their families in tow; one woman told Polataivao she’d seen it five times. “Our elderly, Pacific specifically, are now going to the theatre,” says Polataivao. “[My aunt] said, ‘I don’t remember the last time I went to a film, you know.’”Even in its earliest stages, Magasiva knew he had something special – even if others took longer to cotton on. “It had music littered throughout, comedic elements, the fish-out-of-water story, the teacher-student story, a clash of cultures. I was like, ‘Surely, this is going to be an easy sell,’” Magasiva laughs. “Oh, man, it was not an easy sell.”View image in fullscreenA school choir quickly becomes a testament to the unifying power of art.The main hurdle was casting. Like previous local successes Boy and Whale Rider, Magasiva wanted authentic, local actors – but investors disagreed. “If we said we were going to attach one big actor from Hollywood, it would have gone through without any challenges,” he says. He hopes Tinā’ssuccess proves New Zealand films don’t need celebrity backing: “It does not guarantee local success.”Magasiva, who was born in Samoa and raised in Wellington, has spent the past 20 years building his career as a director of short films, television and commercials. Tināis his debut feature, born from a video of a high school choirperforming at The Big Sing 2013. Watching them sing Maunga e ole Atuolo, a traditional Samoan love song, Magasiva was struck that even though the choir was largely made up of palagi (white), east Asian and south Asian students, the comment section was flooded with Pacific Islanders celebrating the performance.The film fans who remade Jurassic Park​: how an Australian town got behind a $3,000 ‘mockbuster’Read more“I just had this overwhelming sense of pride, not only to be Samoan, but to be a New Zealander as well. Seeing palagi and Asian students performing a part of my culture so well … I felt like crying. I thought, ‘If I can feel like that in a three-minute video, imagine what I can do with a movie.’”From there, Magasiva devised his story of a Samoan music teacher working across cultural and class divides. Polataivao, then teaching at the now defunct Pacific Institute of Performing Arts, initially came on board to help develop the character of Mareta, without knowing that Magasiva always intended to offer her the part. Though she’d worked between theatre, screen and teaching for 25 years, Polataivao still had some insecurities to shake.“We’re in a marketplace now where you’re just so in the mix of young, beautiful, thin people, you could easily be going, ‘Is that the standard? Do I need to be this way?’” she says. “But of course, everyone has a different perspective to share.”View image in fullscreen‘Serve your community before you serve yourself’: the Samoan values embedded in Tinā.Magasiva sought to imbue Tināwith that collaborative philosophy, positioning the harmonic nature of a choir as a direct counter to the siloed pressures of private education. Early in the film, the headmaster says the school encourages “individual excellence,” which is antithetical to how Mareta teaches.“We could learn something from the traditional value system of thinking,” says Magasiva. “In not only Samoan culture, but many indigenous cultures around the world, it would be: serve your community before you serve yourself; be a bit more forgiving.”Throughout the film, Mareta endures a spectrum of racism: from loaded comments about her Samoan attire to a student outright yelling a slur in her face. Everything in the script is based on real experience, says Magasiva.“Not only does [New Zealand] have this history, but we continue to have it today,” he says. “I’ve heard people calling me [the N-word], or coconut. I spoke to a teacher trying to go for a more senior position who [was told outright], ‘No, a Pacific female like you won’t get that position.’” It’s a reality Magasiva wanted to capture truthfully, without letting it overshadow the story. “That’s not what the movie is about – it’s about forgiveness, and acceptance of culture.”For Polataivao, it’s Tinā’s authenticity that underscores its universal appeal. “We as Pacific Islanders are so freaking unique. We have a different way of laughing at ourselves, and we’re unique in terms of our rhythms, the way we are, the way we speak,” she says.“It’s reflected in the amount of feedback I’ve had for Mareta’s character. [People say] ‘That’s my mum. That’s my aunt. Thank you so much.’”Tinā is out in Australian cinemas 1 MayExplore more on these topicsFilmNew ZealandPacific islandsAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The property has five acres of gardens which were designed by Wordsworth.He had rented the house, but in the late 1960s it was bought by his descendants, and has since been open to the public for most of the year. However, after the Covid pandemic, visitor numbers dropped sharply and the house was put on the market for offers over £2.5m.Wordsworth’s great great great great granddaughter, Charlotte Wontner, is now leading a campaign to encourage financial backers to step in and help preserve the house and gardens so that they can be kept open for the public.“It’s too often we are losing our incredible links with the past and this is one major link to the past that we cannot lose”, said Succession actor Cox.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

This treasure belongs to the nation – as much as it does William Wordsworth.”Wontner, whose grandmother bought Rydal Mount in 1969, described it as a “living museum”. The gardens “are where Wordsworth wrote many of his poems and when people get there, there is this wonderful sense of being closer to the poetry.”She said that Wordsworth’s poetry is becoming increasingly important because of his appreciation for nature and the environment.Her cousin, Christopher, who is selling the house, is supportive of the campaign, she said. “We all have the same goal which is to find a way of keeping the house open to people. There may be other relatives who feel the same way and I hope they will get in touch.”The house has “always been referred to, I think, as a place of solace, and that is an important thing nowadays. A place to just have a break from the everyday craziness.”Explore more on these topicsBooksCumbriaWilliam WordsworthnewsShareReuse this content"

They explain how they faced their demons for an arena-sized reunion – and why Simon Cowell was ‘a proper winker’Fri 25 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 25 Apr 2025 06.40 EDTShareIn September 1998, amid a rocketing pop career that would end up with every one of their 11 singles reaching the UK Top 10, British boyband Five went missing. They were due to visit the US, where the lascivious When the Lights Go Out had got huge, but Five – Ritchie Neville (curtains), Scott Robinson (spiky hair), Abz Love (hats), Sean Conlon (baby-faced), and Jason “J” Brown (eyebrow ring) – had other ideas. “We decided we wanted a couple of days off,” says Scott, now without spikes and sporting a thick salt-and-pepper beard. “So we booked our own flights back to the UK.”Rather than visit family like everyone else, J returned to the band’s shared house in Surrey. “There were fans camping outside, literally in tents on the little lawn,” he says, shaking his shaved head, now minus the eyebrow ring. “We needed to decompress – we were losing our minds. But all I had was people shouting through the letterbox at me for three days.” Whenever he wanted food he had to crawl from the living room to the kitchen on his stomach. “Then they started turning against me: ‘We know you’re in there! We bought your album! You owe us!’”View image in fullscreen‘I had fans shouting through the letterbox at me for three days’ … Five (AKA 5ive) in 1998.Photograph: Tim Roney/Getty ImagesIt was an intense time, and of all the returning bands from pop’s Y2K zenith, Five seemed the least likely to reform with their original lineup. By the release of 2001’s Let’s Dance, the band’s third and final UK No 1 single (after 1999’s effervescent Keep on Movin’ and 2000’s Queen collaboration We Will Rock You), Sean had left, depressed and exhausted. With talk of mental health and duty of care nonexistent, the rest of the band were told Sean had glandular fever, and he was replaced in the song’s video by a cardboard cutout. Scott was also at breaking point, having recently pinned their label boss Richard Griffiths against a wall.Rumours swirled of physical fights backstage at ITV show CD:UK, and big studio bust-ups. Scott and Sean both accused J of bullying. In therecent BBC documentary Boybands Forever, Ritchie, an emotional Scott and a haunted-looking Sean made being in Five sound like torture. For a while they pushed the limits of numeracy, retaining their name as the lineup went down to four, then three. The trio version of Five – Scott (who sometimes also performed as “a one-man Five”), Ritchie and Sean – even released an album, 2022’s Time, and toured the nostalgia circuit.Now, on a mild spring day, under a wooden gazebo in the garden of a west London pub, everyone’s acting as if nothing happened. Suspiciously white teeth glisten and banter fills the air like Lynx. A 25-date arena tour is planned for later this year. “When I get back in the room with these dudes,” J says, “that real youthfulness is still there in all of us.”As drinks are delivered, I ask how on earth this reunion happened. “This is the first time we’ve all been truly aligned,” says Sean, now a youthful 43. “Where it just feels right.”They met up at a rented house just outside Birmingham towards the end of 2023. Apparently, nothing about reuniting was on the table. “It was about being friends again,” Scott says. “Reconnecting.”Some people, I say, may assume it was also about the money. “Absolute bullshit,” says Ritchie, his curtains drawn up into a small mohawk. “If we wanted a cash grab we would have done it 15 years ago. By going back into the public domain as the five of us and confronting our fears, our demons, both individually and collectively, it’s a genuine healing process.”Abz, wearing a hat emblazoned with the word “icon”, picks up the theme: “This is bigger than us. We’ve all had our moments, absolutely, but it has to happen. There’s nothing stopping this.” To prove his point, he says he’d do the tour for nothing. “That’s on record!” Scott says, laughing.“We hadn’t been in the same room for 20-odd years,” continues Ritchie, who briefly emigrated to Australia after the band fell apart. Back then, he says, he was “living like a ghost. I didn’t want to be Rich from Five any more, I just wanted to be Rich from Birmingham.” An intriguing mix of new-age deep thinker and Hugo Boss-clad Alan Partridge, Ritchie quickly understood that he couldn’t outrun his past.“I heard Dave Grohl talking about how, after Kurt passed away, he’d gone to some mountains in Ireland to get his head together,” he explains. “He saw this young Irish lad walking along wearing a T-shirt with Kurt Cobain’s face on it, and he was like, ‘I’m never going to escape it, I need to go back and face the music.’ That’s how Foo Fighters were born.” Five, he says, are “kind of similar: you try to resist it, and it just persists. Fortunately or unfortunately, what we did was big and successful enough that we can’t escape it, and we have embraced it.”View image in fullscreen‘I need to go back and face the music’ … Five at the Smash Hits Poll Winners Party after winning Best British Band, December 2000.Photograph: Amanda Edwards/RedfernsThe reunion was “very beautiful”, Sean says. “I can speak for myself and J: we were really close – we shared a room the first time around – so to have that many years apart, not speaking, was like this massive dark cloud.” He holds out his hands, as if cradling it, but the others are fooling around. “I’m holding a dark cloud, actually!” he says, trying to bring order. “Hold on to it, Sean!” laughs Abz. “Then let it rain.”Sean was only 15 when he left home and moved into the group’s riotous shared house in Surrey. J was 23. During their appearance on ITV series The Big Reunion in 2012, Sean revealed that J once told him he had hated him from the moment he first heard him sing.J says he wasn’t aware at the time that Sean and Scott saw his behaviour as bullying. “When I was scared, I’d peacock and puff my chest out and shout loud,” he says, and he was scared most of the time. “Sometimes it would be taken as funny. But I was older, I was physically bigger, so if I’m stood there in front of these guys screaming, then younger dudes are going to feel overwhelmed. I realise why that was taken the way it was.”“We’ve not brushed things under the carpet,” Sean continues, looking at J. “We didn’t get in a room and pretend nothing’s happened. We’re known for being the rowdy Five, but we’re actually five sensitive souls. We speak very openly with each other.”Increasingly famous, perpetually exhausted and innately rebellious, Five were never built to last. Created in 1997 by father and son management duo Bob and Chris Herbert – who had auditioned, nurtured and then lost the Spice Girls to rival managers – and signed by Simon Cowell, the plan was to create the antithesis of sensibly attired Irish stool-botherers Boyzone – and, later, Westlife. “Boyzone were going to bring you a bunch of flowers and Five were going to fuck you against a wall down the side alley,” Chris Herbert told me in 2023.“We were handpicked to be a harder-edged band,” says Ritchie. “They literally said ‘just be yourselves’.” J smiles: “They got a little bit more than they bargained for.”There was rivalry with Westlife, who were also A&R-ed by Cowell: “We got Westlife so drunk once,” Ritchie says, “they were running as fast as they could into a brick wall.” They were also terrible neighbours, as evidenced by their appearance on ITV’s Neighbours from Hell. One night, after a launch party for unlikely label-mates Wu-Tang Clan, they returned home, having had “a few sherbets”, and decided to put up a 3ft poster of the rappers on the living room wall, using a pan for a hammer. “In a terrace house,” J says. “With the neighbours next door. With a baby.”View image in fullscreenNeighbours from hell: on the set of the If Ya Gettin’ Down video in 1999.Photograph: Tim Roney/Getty ImagesThey’re adamant that parts of their reputation have been exaggerated (“We weren’t fighting every day,” sighs Ritchie) and they were more prone to heated arguments than physical fights. “I did kick Rich in his arse once,” J says, “and felt really bad as soon as I did it.” So bad, in fact, that he bought Ritchie a present to say sorry. “His mum called my mum and said, ‘You need to have a word with your son, he’s run up and booted my Rich right in his backside.’”Everyone laughs. “None of us five have ever stood and swung or thrown a punch at each other,” J continues. “That’s what’s got to me over the years, reading a lot of the stuff. Yes, there were people screaming. Scott and I used to be in each other’s faces, because I had a temper. We used to butt heads.”“I’d never let anyone know I was feeling intimidated,” Scott says. “If J was shouting at me, I’d go, ‘Come on then.’”“Put it this way,” Ritchie says, “if you put Jesus and Buddha in a room and gave them the work schedule that we had, I guarantee they’d fall out.”While their British contemporaries were launched first in Europe, Five were immediately pitched as a global act. “Backstreet Boys had hit massively in the States,” says Ritchie, “so while we were releasing our first single, Clive Davis” – the industry legend behind dozens of stars from Janis Joplin to Alicia Keys – “signed us in America. We tried to break the whole world in two years.” Abz, the quietest of the bunch, compares working in Japan to Sofia Coppola’s film Lost in Translation: “The loneliness, that hotel nothingness.”We’re known as the rowdy Five, but we’re actually five sensitive souls. We speak very openly with each otherAmerica was briefly theirs for the taking. When the Lights Go Out was a hit, they had their own Disney special and Cowell was lining them up with big-time producers and songwriters. While they all concede that Cowell was an amazing A&R, he was also what Ritchie calls “a proper winker”. Winker? “He had it down to a fine art,” J explains. “In meetings, there would be a brief moment where if the other four weren’t looking, he’d shoot you a quick wink.” The chosen member would then assume they were the special one. “That’s what it was saying: ‘You’re my boy,’” continues Ritchie. “You’d get outside and go, ‘How many winks did you get?’”You sense the winks may have dried up after Five were offered the chance to record … Baby One More Time before Britney Spears, but instead called what became one of the biggest pop songs of all time “fucking wank” in front of its creator, Max Martin. They also turned down an early version of Bye Bye Bye, which later helped ’NSync compete with Backstreet Boys. “We would have done it in a different way,” J says of the Britney classic, “but it just wasn’t our thing. It didn’t feel right.” Scott senses an opportunity for some banter: “Or in the exact same way but with Rich in a skirt.” He chuckles, imagining a shot-for-shot remake of the video.Ritchie has clearly heard this line before. “Why is it always me in a skirt?” he harrumphs. “You’ve got pretty legs,” J concludes.Sean sits quietly, waiting for the banter bus to pull over. I tell him he seems much more confident now. “I’m actually here this time,” he says, smiling. “Before, I was overwhelmed. I had too much emotion, too much stimulation, and I just couldn’t process it. I was 15.” He had assumed that everyone else in pop was happy, that they knew what they were doing, that they could handle it. He didn’t realise the rest of his own band often felt the same way he did. “I felt very isolated – I didn’t feel like [they] were going through that. I felt like I was the only one. The bond was there [between us], and the deep love, but not the communication.”View image in fullscreen‘I did kick Rich in his arse once’ … J, Sean, Abz, Scott and Ritchie in London, March 2025.Photograph: Pål Hansen/The GuardianHaving been through the boyband wringer, they “resonate” with acts that have arrived in their wake. Years ago at a festival, Ritchie bumped into Richard Griffiths, who was then managing One Direction. “I said, ‘How do they still look fresh?’ We always looked absolutely done in,” Ritchie says. “He went, ‘Well, we’ve learned from your generation of bands how far you can push people.’” Griffiths’ company Modest! now manages Five. “I keep complaining to [them], saying can we work more, can we do more,” says J. That doesn’t include new music, though, at least not yet. “Never say never,” they say, but the focus is on the tour.Boybands Forever: this denim-packed history of 90s British pop is a magical piece of TVRead moreTalk turns to the death ofLiam Payne. While Scott says theyshare a history as boyband members, Sean is clear that they didn’t know him and to compare the two situations would be “superficial”. He says he’s not sure about the suggestion there should be a minimum age limit for prospective pop band members. “Every child is different. My mum and dad had to make a judgment call on whether I did it and I would never change it in a million years. I was meant to go through it and that’s why I’m here now.”As they finish their drinks, Ritchie suddenly spots a robin. “That’s Derek,” he says. I laugh, thinking he’s just named it randomly. “I’m not even joking, it’s Derek. That’s my dead stepfather.” Suddenly, in unison, the band start singing, before holding up their glasses: “Cheers, Derek!” They seem happy back in their Five bubble; older and wiser, but still teenagers somehow.“All I ever wanted was to be happy in this formation of Five,” Scott says. “I’ve already got that and we haven’t stepped on stage yet. So when we’re doing a promo day, I’m excited that I’m going to see the boys.”“We’re enjoying ourselves,” says Sean, a man reborn. “We’re having the time of our lives.”Five’s UK and Ireland tour begins 29 October at Utilita Arena, CardiffExplore more on these topicsPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On any night, across its upstairs studio theatre, its main house and basement cabaret bar, you’ll find plays from new writers, experimentations in clowning, drag performance, standup comedy, or a hybrid of them all.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In those rooms, I’ve watched American clown Natalie Palamides giving such a spirited performance that she vomited on stage, dancer and comedian Adrienne Truscott challenging rape jokes, and performance artist Kim Noble pushing audiences beyond comfort. I’ve sung along to ballads with sketch group Daphne, and folk songs with Sh!tTheatre.Soho does all this by running a “festival programme”, with multiple shows per room, per night. “It allows us to take risks,” says executive director and CEO Mark Godfrey. “You can say now, 25 years on, we had the first play from Tanika Gupta, from Moira Buffini, early work from Chris Chibnall.”And perhaps most famously of all,Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who first performed her one-woman show – and later hit TV series – Fleabag at the venue. “Soho theatre has a genuinely experimental, risk-taking attitude,” Waller-Bridge says. “It’s one of the only theatres that consistently puts on provocative work from lesser-known writers and performers and encourages them to be original. I’ve seen some of the best work of my life in those spaces.”Waller-Bridge began her artistic relationship with Soho in 2009, in finance-industry satireRoaring Trade: “I remember throttling Andrew Scott with a tie as the lights went up every night, which was the beginning of one of the most happy collaborations of my life.” With colleagues in her DryWrite theatre company, Francesca Moody and Vicky Jones, she became an associate artist at the theatre, commissioning Adolescence writer Jack Thorne’s play Mydidae in 2012.Fleabag first appeared in Soho’s upstairs room. Being offered space to preview “was no small thing”, Waller-Bridge says. It returned, post-Edinburgh, and Soho supported its West End transfer. “It’s Fleabag’s home. The Soho theatre audience is so up for it … unshockable, game for anything, fun-loving and curious.”Now that game-for-anything is going to get a lot larger. As the theatre celebrates its 25th anniversary, it’s also starting a new chapter – the opening of 1,000-seaterSoho TheatreWalthamstow, in north-east London, where it will entertain its biggest audiences yet.We started to feel like the natural home for people’s one-hour shows in the early 2000s, and it’s snowballed from thenSteve Lock, head of comedyIt’s been a long journey. Soho theatre on the West End’s Dean Street opened in 2000, but the company was founded as the Soho Theatre Company in the late 60s by theatre directors Verity Bargate (namesake of Soho’s new writing award) and Fred Proud. It became Soho Poly when it moved into a university basement in 1972. Deliberately free from “the trappings of bourgeois theatre architecture”, it was a pioneer of lunchtime theatre, allowing performances to “reach a different sort of audience”,write Matthew Morrison and Guy Osbornefrom the University of Westminster. That basement showcased future stars such as Bob Hoskins, Harriet Walter, Hanif Kureishi and Caryl Churchill. “It was about new plays and new writing, that fringe explosion of the 70s,” says Godfrey, who’s been with the company since 1990, its final year as Soho Poly.By the mid-90s, after a stint at Cockpit theatre, Soho theatre was homeless. Fortuitously, the national lottery was emerging. With director Abigail Morris and producer David Aukin, Godfrey found a building on Dean Street that had formerly housed a synagogue. The vision was influenced by the diversity and collective spirit of the south London theatre Ovalhouse, the ICA’s punk aesthetics and experimental performances, the fun of comedy clubs. Rather than one artistic director, Soho has “a plurality of voices”, Godfrey says. “They love the work,” says performance artist Bryony Kimmings. “In the curating of their programme, they’re also artists.”View image in fullscreenBaby Reindeer creator Richard Gadd in his show Monkey See, Monkey Do in 2016.Photograph: Soho theatreThose voices now include creative associate Pooja Sivaraman and head of comedy Steve Lock.Comedyis now a core part of Soho’s identity. In 2000, short-ish plays meant Dean Street’s stages were free by 9pm, so mixed-bill comedy, then eventually solo standup shows, filled the gap.Lock started working on the box office in 2001, but soon moved into comedy programming, scouting experimental shows at the fringe, and programming things crowds couldn’t find at comedy clubs. “It was about full-length shows, which intrinsically felt more theatrical. We started to feel like the natural home for people’s one-hour shows in the early 2000s, and it’s snowballed from then.” Soho welcomed American drag performers such as Kiki and Herb, plus acts such as Hannah Gadsby before their rise to fame.For the first 10 years at Dean Street, the basement was an Indian restaurant, which also ran the ground-floor bar. In 2011, it became Soho Theatre Bar, and the basement became a bespoke cabaret space. They decided “to give equal importance to theatre, comedy and cabaret”, Godfrey says.Lock points to artists like Kimmings and Noble, who could never be squeezed into one box. Temi Wilkey, whose recent show Main Character Energy blended performance styles, says: “It’s an extraordinary space for people whose work is genre-pushing.” Kimmings says: “They never say no. They trust you to be creative.” When I ask artists what sets Soho theatre apart from other institutions, many say community. Associate artists used to be given membership to the Groucho Club, but when the theatre started running the bar, this was swapped for bar discounts instead. The idea was to build a club-like atmosphere right there.When you enter Dean Street’s bar now, chances are you’ll recognise someone – it’s a “snipers’ alley” per one TV producer’s analogy; you’re always in the eyeline of an artist, writer, agent. For punters, this means the chance to spot a star.Social media was abuzzin 2023 when Florence Pugh, Andrew Garfield and Phoebe Bridgers were snapped after attending Kate Berlant’s show.It helps that many of the artists connected to Soho arrived as fledging talent, such as Waller-Bridge, growing within the theatre, before achieving mainstream status. Kimmings had never visited Soho theatre until a meeting to discuss the transfer of her 2010 fringe show Sex Idiot, a tale of chlamydia and reappraising relationships. She’s spoken in the past about the snobbery and classism that can come with traditional theatre. Soho is “not like that at all”, she says. Meeting Lock and dramaturg Nina Steiger: “The two of them felt like family, like home, immediately,” Kimmings says. They earned her respect. “[Steiger] taught me how to use the principles of narratives, that was so exciting to me,” she says, and she saw Lock’s passion for new work. When she wanted to make another show – an exploration of alcohol and creativity – they gave her space to develop and she wanted their input. Kimmings now teaches young artists and says most dream of staging their work at Soho. “It’s managed to establish a mark of quality and experimentalism.It feels like if you’re there, you’re original, you’re good quality.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Without that we’ll just end up with generic workPhoebe Waller-BridgeCheerleading new artists is vital, says Waller-Bridge, especially in the current funding climate: “Writers need places to take risks, and to have the support of a theatre who back you as an individual rather than just a single project means you can push the boundaries.” Without that, “we’ll just end up with more and more generic work because people need to hedge their bets”.View image in fullscreenPoppy Jay and Rubina Pabani in Brown Girls Do It Too, the Soho theatre adaptation of their podcast.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianPoppy Jay, of the podcast Brown Girls Do It Too, used to walk past Soho theatre on the way to Topshop in nearby Oxford Circus. It seemed like “a cool place”, but not for her. “Brown women, south Asian people, the theatre space doesn’t really feel like ours,” she says. Jay and co-host Rubina Pabani were invited to create a stage version of their podcast, which they developed at Dean Street into a theatrical mix of jokes, sketches and discussion of sexuality and cultural expectations. Despite initial fears of not belonging, she says the theatre is “embracing of talent and people from other backgrounds. It’s completely different to how I always imagined theatre spaces to be.”While many artists are scouted, Soho theatre also runs “labs” to coach new talent. Comedians Jack Rooke and Olga Koch started in the comedy programme and playwright Ryan Calais Cameron in the writers’ lab. Rooke, creator of sitcom Big Boys, remembers the comedy lab as “the most valuable education I’ve ever had. One day would be being taught how to apply to go to the fringe by Richard Gadd, the next week we’d have a masterclass with the DryWrite team,” he says. “It taught me to be OK with putting darkness and silliness next to each other.”It led to the live show Good Grief, about the aftermath of his dad’s death, and two subsequent shows, the seeds of Big Boys. He commemorated Soho’s role in his career by naming a Big Boys’ character after staff member Jules Haworth, who helped him secure a comedy lab bursary. Soho got TV commissioners in the door, Rooke says: “It’s always been good at taking a risk on new talent and not just following where the buzz is.”View image in fullscreenSteffen Hanes and Natalie Palamides in Stamptown at the Soho theatre, 2024.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianIn the upstairs studio, Sivaraman describes the importance of the labs while in the background performer Shafeeq Shajahan rehearses The Bollywood Guide to Revenge. “Shafeeq started on the writers’ lab and drag lab, and this show was programmed as part of Soho Rising [a new talent festival] last year. Now it has a one-week run.” With the opening of Soho Theatre Walthamstow, there’s potential to reach a larger stage. Palamides, who’s worked with Soho since her debut show Laid, will be the first to grace the beautifully restored theatre with Weer, her absurd 90s romcom that earned plaudits in Edinburgh. Jay will perform Brown Girls Do It Too later in the year – as a Walthamstow local, she saw films in the venue as a teen, so it feels like a full-circle moment. In the autumn, Kimmings will present Bog Witch, about rediscovering nature, her first show in more than five years: “I don’t think I could’ve done it with anybody else.”It’s been nearly 15 years since Godfrey joined the fight to transform the Walthamstow venue, which nearly became a church, into a functioning theatre. With the launch imminent, he reflects on Soho’s origins. “One of the challenges is: how do you become a bigger organisation and still keep that queer-punk, radical-fringe core identity?”‘A sight to behold!’ Soho Theatre Walthamstow brings live performance back to historic venueRead moreThey hope that “plurality of voices” in the theatre’s artistic team and the relationships they’ve built with artists over the years will preserve the Soho spirit. In the early days of Dean Street, the company was “under the radar”, says Godfrey, the pressure was off and creativity flowed. Will it be easier to fill an auditorium now on the cachet of Soho’s past successes, or will people expect mainstream acts from a larger venue? Alongside the company’s usual genre-melding works, tickets are already on sale for a pantomime and shows from Jon Ronson and Adam Kay. “We believe it will work, but it will be nice when you actually see it.”During the redevelopment, there was some criticism over theloss of local LGBTQ+ venue The Victoria, which adjoins the site, but there has also been local outreach work. There are new labs programmes for Walthamstow locals, and many of the staff, including Godfrey and Soho Theatre Walthamstow co-chair Alessandro Babalola are locals themselves. Growing affection and audiences among residents, as well as persuading others to make the journey out, will be crucial.Memories formed at Dean Street might hold lessons in how to retain the theatre’s identity. Kimmings laughs as she recalls one night in the cabaret basement, when an audience member bit her leg and she ended her show dancing on stage next to Juliette Lewis. To her, Soho theatre is “a place where you get to be free. A place where you can cast off your baggage and really belly laugh. That is so precious.”Soho Theatre Walthamstow opens on 2 May.Explore more on these topicsTheatreSoho theatreSoho TheatrePhoebe Waller-BridgeFleabagComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)featuresShareReuse this content"

Largely funded by the sale of Coppola’s own vineyards, the sci-fi epic starring Adam Driver took around $14m at the global box office amid unconvinced reviews and rumours of abnormal on-set behaviour by its director.A marketing campaign attempted to leverage bad critical notices by flagging that previous works by Coppola now acclaimed as masterpieces – including Apocalypse Now and The Godfather – had been dismissed by critics at the time. But this backfired after it emerged all of the sniffy historical reviews had been fabricated.The film failed to earn the attention of awards bodies other than the Golden Raspberries for bad movies, which voted the film both worst director and worst supporting actor (for Jon Voight).Now, a new attempt to ensure the legacy of what may be the 86-year-old director’s final film has been announced: a comic book re-interpretation by Chris Ryall, titled Francis Ford Coppola’s Megalopolis: An Original Graphic Novel.In a statement on Thursday, Coppola explained that the book would not simply be a re-rendering of his film. “I was pleased to put the idea of a graphic novel in the competent hands of Chris Ryall with the idea that, although it was inspired by my film Megalopolis, it didn’t necessarily have to be limited by it,” he said.“I hoped the graphic novel would take its own flight, with its own artists and writer so that it would be a sibling of the film, rather than just an echo. That’s what I feel Chris, Jacob Phillips and the team at Abrams ComicArts have accomplished. It confirms my feeling thatartcan never be constrained, but rather always a parallel expression, and part of the bounty we can make available to our patrons, audiences and readers.”Said Ryall: “Coppola’s storytelling challenged and inspired me at every turn,” adding that he hoped he had “created something that both honours and expands the world of the original film.”Although graphic novels are often used as source material for film, in particular for superhero movies, the reverse is considerably more unusual.Explore more on these topicsFrancis Ford  CoppolaMegalopolisComics and graphic novelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Heinous LOSER behaviour.”Responding on Instagram to the interaction, Ra’ouf applauded Pascal and said he also felt the “immense pain” of the silence of other celebrities.Pascal has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and is frequently accompanied on the red carpet by his transgender sister, Lux.Rowling has attracted some backlash to a photograph she posted of herself last week, smoking a cigar on a yacht with the caption: “I love it when a plan comes together.”This came after the UK supreme court sitting in London ruled that the terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman and biological sex. The action to determine this had been brought by For Women Scotland, a campaign group which brought a case against the Scottish government in which they argued that sex-based protections should only apply to those born female.Rowling wrote on X: “It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the supreme court and, in winning, they’ve protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,” adding, “For Women Scotland, I’m so proud to know you.”In February, Pascal shared the quote: “A world without trans people has never existed and never will,” on Instagram, dividing his followers. After some threatened to unfollow him, he reiterated his stance, writing: “I can’t think of anything more vile and small and pathetic than terrorising the smallest, most vulnerable community of people who want nothing from you, except the right to exist.”Earlier this week, he wore a T-shirt reading: “Protect the Dolls” to the London premiere of Marvel’s Thunderbolts*, part of a pro-trans campaign by American designer Conner Ives.HBO reveals first part of Harry Potter TV cast, including Dumbledore and HagridRead moreSome of the cast of the new HBO Harry Potter series have experienced online abuse in response to their involvement. However, all three of the key actors so far revealed have also played landmark LGBTQ+ roles. John Lithgow, who will play Albus Dumbledore, won much acclaim for his performance as a transgender woman in 1982’s The World According to Garp.Janet McTeer, who takes over as Professor McGonagall, played a trans man in 2011’s Albert Nobbs, while Paapa Essiedu (cast as Prof Snape) has frequently played queer roles, most notably in I May Destroy You and the short film Femme, in which he played a gay drag performer.The series begins filming later this year. Casting of the leading children’s roles has yet to be announced.This article was amended on 25 April 2025. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the recent Equality Act ruling was made by “judges in Scotland”; in fact it was made by UK supreme court judges, sitting in London.Explore more on these topicsFilmPedro PascalJK RowlingHarry Potter (Books)Harry Potter (Film)TransgenderLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the morning they might take breakfast in a room with Canaletto paintings on the wall and Meissen plates on which to butter their toast.The custodians of a place that is arguably England’s grandest, most beautiful country house are considering next year bringing in high-end hospitality packages.It comes as theNorth Yorkshirehouse on Thursday revealed the results of a major restoration project, five years in the planning, which included updates to rooms, a rehang, a transformation of its Long Gallery and a fabulous recreation of a Tapestry Drawing Room destroyed in a fire in 1940.The house is already well known from being used in TV and film, includingStanley Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon, the 1981 ITV series and the 2008 film Brideshead Revisited and more recently in Netflix’s Bridgerton, where characters played byRegé-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevorturn a fake courtship into a blissful marriage.View image in fullscreenA bedroom at Castle Howard.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIt has also been occasionally hired for private hospitality events such asEllie Goulding’s wedding reception.The idea of it being used as a kind of expensive, exclusive Airbnb would appear to be the next step.“We’ve always referred to this as a living house,” said Nicholas Howard, a descendant of Charles Howard, the third Earl of Carlisle who commissioned the house in 1699. “It’s not a museum. And if you’re going to call it a living house, you’ve got to make it a living house. And that involves having people in it.”There is also a more practical reason, said his wife, Victoria Howard, aformer chief executive of HarperCollins. “We need income for the next burnt-out room. We’ve got quite a few more.”View image in fullscreenThe Long Gallery.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHaving people pay to stay is a likely project for next year, she said. “We would probably do it no more than a couple of times a year because it would interfere with the day visitors.”Those day visitors number nearly 300,000 a year. They come to marvel at not only the notable architecture, conceived by Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, but to enjoy acres of sweeping parkland filled with lakes, fountains, statues, temples andpyramids.One of the bleakest moments in the house’s history wasthe 1940 fire, which took place while it was being used as a wartime girls’ school. It destroyed Castle Howard’s incredible dome and more than 40 rooms.The dome was restored by George Howard in 1962 and income from Brideshead Revisited allowed the reconstruction of the Garden Hall and New Library.The recreation of the lost Tapestry Drawing Room is arguably the star attraction of the latest restoration project.The tapestries were woven for the room in 1706 by John Vanderbank and depict the four seasons in scenes taken from the work of David Teniers.Luckily, when the fire happened they were not in the room. “They had been on a sort of trek around the house to various places, each of which was more inappropriate than the last,” said Howard.View image in fullscreenNicholas and Victoria Howard in the Tapestry Drawing Room.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianNow they are back where they should be, in the newly restored and furnished room, for the first time in centuries.“This is the first time I’ve seen them really because you can now get up close to them and that’s important,” he said. “You can see the detail.“In some ways, I’m sort of getting to know them properly for the first time in my life, which is really nice.”The renewal project has not been without its difficulties along the way, not least the choice of painting to hang over the mantelpiece.“I said that I felt it ought to be definitely some sort of classical scene, an allegory or a historical scene or whatever,” said Howard.Auction sites were scoured and the ideal painting was found in Barcelona – a work by the Italian baroque painter, Sebastiano Ricci.It was successfully bought. “We then discovered that, actually, it had been sold from this house in 1991,” said Howard. “For a lot less than we bought it for.”Castle Howard’s 21st Century Renaissance opens to the public on 25 April.Explore more on these topicsCastle HowardNorth YorkshireBridgertonArchitectureExhibitionsNetflixBrideshead RevisitednewsShareReuse this content"

There are shades of Uncle Vanya,a play McPherson has adapted, with a plot involving a family reuniting in the countryside to feud over the ownership of land and inheritance. There are elements of the American family dysfunction drama too, though this is distinctly Irish in its cadence, rhythm and setting. Individually, each influence is valid and every idea is a good one but together the play seems to swing on its hinges, like this family’s clapped out farm-door.We are in the rural depths of County Sligo in 1981, inside a household run by two siblings: the stoic Stephen (Brian Gleeson), who is existing rather than living, and the eccentric and autistic Billie (Rosie Sheehy). They are marooned on the down-at-heel farm, just about making ends meet until their wealthier brother, Dermot (Chris O’Dowd) drops by. His presence coincides with the arrival of an old blind uncle and former clergyman (Seán McGinley) who has been ejected from church quarters and now shuffles into the family home with his housekeeper, Elizabeth (Derbhle Crotty), with a dispute over the farm’s ownership – though this plot point does not emerge until late on.View image in fullscreenA standout force … Rosie Sheehy in The Brightening Air.Photograph: Manuel HarlanComfy domesticity offsets abrasive sibling undercurrents as they gather around a dining table to eat, reminiscence and poke each other. McPherson, who also directs, throws in other tensions: Dermot comes with his inappropriately young squeeze, Freya (Aisling Kearns) while his estranged wife, Lydia (Hannah Morrish), still in love with her husband, puts her faith in “magic water” that might return him to her.The pace is too easy in the first half, as the flotsam and jetsam of family life float by. There is a good Chekhovian mix of melancholy and humour in the cross-conversational currents between family members, but it all needs more momentum and emotional drive. The second half brings more intensity but also a plot that feels stretched to aburdism: there is a miracle in the vein of the biblical Bartimaeus (the blind beggar from Jericho) alongside the falling out and making up over inheritance.The mystical element sits well within the plotline of the magic water but becomes pronounced and protruding when characters talk about God and nothingness. You get the sense of a playwright preoccupied by big questions about the afterlife (with repeated mentions of reincarnation and the Ganges) but this sometimes sounds non sequitur in the mouths of his characters.There are none of the explosions of an American dysfunction drama here and angry face-offs between siblings steer close to the humorous and absurd.Sibling ribbing sometimes combusts into something more; there is wrestling between brothers, the lone sister is one of the “lads”, and home truths are occasionally spoken, or shouted, but you wish these scenes would dig into a few more nerves.‘To hell with RP’ … how surprise Olivier nominee Rosie Sheehy is following in Richard Burton’s footstepsRead moreStill, there are heaps of charm and a few searing moments. McPherson’s last work at the Old Vic was the musicalGirl from the North Country, and there is music here too, though it is not a musical. Lovely dramatic interludes feature piano music, songs carrying Celtic lilts but also, puzzlingly, a Bollywood number.An incredibly strong cast is gathered: O’Dowd is a delight as the family’s self-regarding eldest brother and Sheehy, as always, is a standout force. She plays a largely comic character but infuses Billie with great emotion.The idea of love and its yearning is shown with delicacy. Every character seems unrequited, from the farmhand (Eimhin Fitzgerald Doherty) who is sweet on Billie, to the sexual undercurrents that swirl around Stephen and Lydia. Rae Smith’s set is beautiful, full of diaphanous, overlying images of trees, water, misty mountains, sky, conjuring a vivid sense of place but also carrying a certain otherworldly magic. Sometimes this production lifts off, as if it is about to enter into the sublime, but is strangely dragged down by too many elements jostling to take flight.At theOld Vic, London, until 14 June.Explore more on these topicsConor McPhersonTheatreOld Vic TheatreChris O'DowdreviewsShareReuse this content"

TikTok has turned the genre into a lifestyle for alt teens, while the internet radio station NTS has made itself synonymous with hazy, deadpan underground pop. But the Irish musician’s sound feels distinctive: both slightly alienating – cool to the touch, unnervingly atmospheric – and slightly sexy, songs like Mayfly and Violet moving with an alluring looseness that often eludes experimental indie music of this stripe.View image in fullscreenMaria Somerville: LusterSimple but evocative lyrics suggest an endearing curiosity about the world: “Sometimes the sky / Invites me to truly be / Myself more than it could actually be,” she sings on Trip, a curiously circular phrase that feels tentative and certain at the same time. Somerville sings in hushed tones surrounded by chilly production, but when you listen closely, these songs reveal themselves to be unusually swollen with texture and detail: harps twinkle like broken glass and baggy breakbeats reverberate widely, seemingly recorded through a bedroom wall. She has an expansive purview: part of the thrill of Luster is listening closely enough to pick up on the traces of pop, hymnal, trip-hop and experimental electronic music that lies beneath.It’s this approach that makes Luster so vividly alive: this is no dusty genre exercise. It was inspired by Somerville’s home of Connemara, and she occasionally luxuriates in nuanced, evocative field recordings, as on closer October Moon, when she samples the sound of waves at low tide. But outside those moments of specificity, it feels like a representation of the expansive beauty of solitude, and the beautiful chaos that can be found in quiet moments: a symphony of small ideas rendered in the colours of a sunset.Explore more on these topicsMusicIndiePop and rockExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

This is Zoé Basha, a Dublin-based French-American singer and guitarist whose folk music swims deftly around country, jazz, French chanson and the blues.View image in fullscreenZoé Basha: GambleThis is a nourishing, impressive 11-song set, with Basha’s voice swooping high and low like the Appalachian mountain music she loves. It begins boldly with Love Is Teasin’, first recorded by Appalachian singer Jean Ritchie and covered by Shirley Collins on her 1954 debut. Basha’s precise enunciation nails her protagonist’s wearisome experience of love, but a friskiness also lurks at the ends of her phrases, her highest notes tremulous with heat. She also masters playfulness on Sweet Papa Hurry Home (a cover of Jack Neville and Jimmie Rodgers’s 1932 country song, Sweet Mama Hurry Home, which shows how naturally the genre’s roots mixed with jazz), sweet suggestiveness on Come Find Me Lonesome, an original tailor-made for a blues club: “Cold is creeping up my spine in the night-time.”She’s also a nifty collaborator. In her version of the ballad Three Little Babes (with nyckelharpa player Aina Tulier and singer Anna Mieke, with whom she sings in three-part-harmony group Rufous Nightjar), the tale of death and dreams bristles with hunger of horror. But she also writes great originals full of texture and feeling. The best are Dublin Street Corners, a great patchwork of failed dreams in a booze-soaked city (“I’m the one you lie next to in bed / When you’re too tired to try, or so’s you said”) and the chanson-flavoured Traveling Shoes, full of the nonchalant ruminating of a fly-by-night lover. “I can’t leave my heart trailing behind just to greet you in the morning,” Basha sings, as you try to hold tight to these fabulous songsAlso out this monthNordic duoMaija Kauhanen and Johannes Geworkian Hellmanbring together the hurdy-gurdy, kantele (a plucked Baltic psaltery) and sympathetic synthesisers onMigrating (Gammalthea), an album mirroring the passages of birds through the seasons.

Romantic relationships are meant to have passionate highs and lows, but by the time you reach adulthood, you expect your friendships to have reached some kind of equilibrium. I have this image in my head of myself as an affectionate, devoted friend – but sometimes I examine my true feelings towards the women who are closest to me and feel shocked by my own pettiness. It is embarrassing to be a grownup but still capable of such intense flashes of rage, and envy. When my friendships become distant or strained, I wonder why I still struggle to do this basic thing.Bad Friend represents a kind of love letter to female friendship, but doesn’t gloss over how difficult it can be. Tiffany Watt Smith is a historian, and this book is a deeply researched study of 20th-century women’s relationships, but the reason for writing it is intensely personal. In the prologue, she says that she fell out with her best friend, Sofia, in her early 30s, and has been battling with the feeling that she is incapable of close friendship ever since. In one passage, she describes hiding a sparkly “BFF” (best friends forever) T-shirt from her five-year-old daughter, because she felt so conflicted about having no BFF of her own. But the idea that underpins this book is that we expect too much of female friendship, and that leaves every woman feeling inadequate.We mythologise friendship as endlessly supportive and rewarding, flattening its complexity. Part of the problem, Watt Smith argues, is that history has been mostly written by men, so the reality of what it has meant to have close female friends through time has received very little academic attention. In this book, she trawls through the archives to trace the history of imperfect, ordinary friends – who hurt and disappoint each other, but keep striving for connection regardless. Bad Friend is Watt Smith’s attempt to replace the ideal of female friendship with a “new paradigm” that we might actually be able to live up to.This book is about accepting friendships as they actually are, rather than as you would like them to beWatt Smith’s relationship with Sofia disintegrated partly because of her own jealousy. Sofia was getting married and planning a baby, and Watt Smith felt left behind. In a chapter called Traitor, she mines books, magazines and psychoanalytic case notes from the 1970s and 80s, collecting testimonies from women who felt competitive and hurt when their friends got promoted, or started families. In one fascinating passage, Watt Smith quotes the 17th-century poet Katherine Phillips, who felt so betrayed by her best friend’s marriage that she never forgave her. “We may generally conclude the Marriage of a Friend to be a Funeral of aFriendship,” she complained in a letter from 1662.By tracing a history for her own difficult feelings towards Sofia, Watt Smith isn’t trying to justify herself, or suggest that her reader should simply luxuriate in those negative emotions – but she argues that we shouldn’t try to repress them, either. By reading about other women who have resented their friends, we can begin to acknowledge those impulses in ourselves, and move past them.Watt Smith writes about how hard female friendship can be without ever diminishing its preciousness. She tells the story of actress Cookie Mueller, who was nursed up until her death from Aids-related illness by her friend and ex-partner Sharon Niesp, using it as a jumping-off point to discuss other women who step in to support friends who are let down by the medical system. In another chapter, she uncovers a lost history of networks of hundreds of women who lived communally around Europe between 1200-1500, amassing wealth and political influence, entirely without men. Watt Smith doesn’t edit out the challenging parts of these relationships. She writes about the resentments carers felt towards their friends, and the infighting that took place in the communes – but that honesty is precisely what makes this book feel so valuable. Only by accepting the limitations of female friendship can we appreciate its full potential.Towards the end of the book, Watt Smith reconnects with Sofia, but there is no grand reconciliation. They have dinner at a chain restaurant and it is stilted and a little awkward. They can’t quite recapture what they have lost. She writes that since that night, she and Sofia have slowly found their way back to each other, but it’s different – less intimate – and each has to accept the other has changed. This feels like a perfectly imperfect way to finish this book, which is about accepting relationships as they actually are, rather than as you would like them to be.If we stop expecting female friendship to be frictionless, women like me will stop wanting to abandon a close relationship every time they feel jealous or hurt. With this book, Watt Smith provides us with a blueprint for how to sustain friendships that are flawed, and sometimes painful – but more meaningful because they are real.Bad Friend: A Century of Revolutionary Friendships by Tiffany Watt Smith is published by Faber (£18.99).

As the 98-minute Disney+ documentary Flintoff begins, we find its subject sitting in a hospital room. He can’t feel his lip, the one that was torn from his face in a nightmarish car accident on theTop Geartrack in 2022. But more than that, he is mentally checked out. As one doctor after another tells him that he is recovering well and looking good, he stares at the ground dejectedly. He just wants everyone to stop sugarcoating everything and tell him the truth, he says. What he wants to hear is that he looks like “a fucking mess”.Flintoff was designed as the big unveiling of the new, post-accident Freddie Flintoff. His days as a cricketing prodigy are over and so, it seems, are his days as a permanent light entertainment fixture. He is older, slower and more reflective. He is also plagued, night after night, by looping footage of the accident thatended Top Gear. Ostensibly this is where we’ll get to watch his comeback.But a few things stand in the way of that. The first and most glaring is that Flintoff’s comeback has already been conducted in public. This documentary is preceded by two others –Freddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams on Tourand Freddie Flintoff: Living With Bulimia – that already covered a lot of its ground. Oddly, both of those shows and this were all made by the same production company. More recently Flintoff hosted last year’s Bullseye Christmas special, which undermines the central question in Flintoff of whether he’ll be able to pull himself back from the brink.The second problem is the format. To watch the Freddie Flintoff story told in a film is to realise that it would have made an incredible series. Very few people have had a life as spectacular. He was a blazingly talented cricketer from the off, burly and powerful and fast and charismatic, which gave him enough of a platform to transcend the sport. But he could also be his own worst enemy; a hard-drinking lad’s lad who brought shame upon the England team by – of all things –getting hammered and falling off a pedalo. He retired from cricket and lost his way again, before finding even greater fame as the host of multiple television programmes. He was brought in to save Top Gear, the jewel in the BBC’s crown, before the accident that sent him into retreat from the public.View image in fullscreenEngland cricketers (left to right) Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Flintoff during the team’s Ashes victory parade around London, 2005.Photograph: Philip Brown/ECB/PATold chronologically, with an episode dedicated to each chapter, Flintoff could have been a definitive deep-dive into an effortlessly compelling character. Instead, though, the film whiplashes backwards and forwards in time. Really, the hook of the thing is the crash and its aftermath, which Flintoff has largely kept to himself. But every time he starts to open up about the loneliness he felt, or the fear of frightening his children with his scars, we’re hauled back to a golden-days segment about the 2005 Ashes, or a talking heads clip of James Corden discussingA League of Their Own. It’s a profoundly frustrating way to tell a story.And then there is Flintoff himself. At one point in the film he is asked if he prefers to be called Freddie or Andrew, and jokes that there are two of him, or “maybe more”. This is extremely evident here. One of the things that makes him stand out from most of his peers is his readiness to discuss the hard topics. He is incredibly open about the pressures of fame, his eating disorders, and the PTSD that his crash understandably left him with. But he slams down the shutters at speed whenever he isn’t comfortable.This is most evident when he’s asked about his Top Gear co-hosts, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris. Harris has spoken publicly about the crash before, but not here. This, it turns out, may have something to do with Flintoff essentially cutting off contact with them, partly out of shame at how the crash affected their careers. Even the fact that Flintoff is a Disney+ film, when he’s one of the faces of the BBC, speaks to a level of unhealed trauma that he refuses to broach here.Make no mistake, Freddie Flintoff is a fascinating man and it’s clear that his story is far from over. Had this film been afforded a little more time and distance, it could have been something very special. As it is, though, it may be for fans only.Flintoff is on Disney+ nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDocumentaryAndrew FlintoffCricketTop GearFactual TVPost-traumatic stress disorderreviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus: an intimate documentary about the extraordinary life of the cricketerPhil HarrisonFri 25 Apr 2025 02.00 EDTSharePick of the weekThe Four SeasonsThree apparently stable couples, all deep into middle age and preoccupied with statins and second homes, go on an annual holiday together. It’s expected to be a gentle affair but Nick (Steve Carell) is about to drop a bombshell: he’s bored and frustrated and he’s leaving Anne (Kerri Kenney-Silver).Tina Fey’s comedy, adapted from a 1981 film starring Alan Alda who cameos here, is a mixture of deepest cringe – an unsuspecting Anne has organised a vow renewal party and invited everyone they know to witness their collapsing marriage – and melancholy revelations about fading dreams. Before long, the other two relationships are getting a thorough stress test too.Netflix, from Thursday 1 MaySuspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de MenezesView image in fullscreenThe tragedy that became a scandal … Edison Alcaide as Jean Charles de Menezes in Suspect.Photograph: Stefania Rosini/Disney+With a botched surveillance operation followed by a shameful attempt at covering tracks, the killing of innocent Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes was a tragedy that became first a scandal, and then an insight into issues at the Metropolitan police. Jeff Pope’s drama is a tense rendering of the events of summer 2005, dramatising the bombings on 7 July and the feverish atmosphere of the following weeks. It’s rightly severe on the Met’s top brass but, crucially, never forgets the story of the blameless victim – played stoically and sensitively by Edison Alcaide.Disney+, from Wednesday 30 AprilFlintoffView image in fullscreenVulnerable … Andrew Flintoff.Photograph: Kerry Spicer/Disney+The first act ofAndrew Flintoff’s life – a brilliant cricket career during which he was the central figure in the greatest Ashes series of all time – was remarkable enough. What followed would have stretched the bounds of fiction if it wasn’t true: Flintoff sustained life-altering injuries in a car crash before attaining national treasure status all over again thanks to his moving series Freddie Flintoff’s Field of Dreams. This intimate documentary sees him in vulnerable mode, talking frankly about the anxieties of life in the public eye and the still-lingering trauma of his accident.Disney+, out nowChef’s Table: LegendsView image in fullscreenA passionate pioneer … Alice Waters in Chef’s Table: Legends.Photograph: NetflixChef’s Tableis 10 years old this month. And after a decade of luxuriously produced food porn, it’s having a party. This anniversary show looks back over the decade and salutes a selection of chefs who have made a significant impact. These include Alice Waters, a passionate pioneer of the “farm to table” movement that emphasises personal relationships with producers and regional terroir; José Andrés, who has combined high-end cuisine with humanitarian work; and our very own Jamie Oliver, who has democratised good cookery on reasonable budgets.Netflix, from Monday 28 Aprilskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After beginning his career in a cheap restaurant, he rose through Parisian society – first as a pioneer of exquisite and absurdly lavish table decorations, then as a master chef. This glossy drama depicts Carême (Benjamin Voisin) as an incorrigible sensualist – a man for whom food was simply one facet of the decadence with which he lived his life. It’s a melodramatic and frequently risque telling of an enjoyably wild story.Apple TV+, from Wednesday 30 AprilThe EternautView image in fullscreenApocalyptic … Ricardo Darín in El Eternauta.Photograph: Mariano Landet/NetflixAdapted froma graphic novelby Héctor Germán Oesterheld, this metaphorical and literal chiller from Argentina has vague echoes of The Day of the Triffids. A group of men in an underground bunker avoid a midsummer snowfall in Buenos Aires; what they find when they reach the surface is baffling and terrifying – the snow is toxic and precedes an alien invasion of Earth. With most of the population dead, there’s an enemy army to fight and not many people left to do the fighting. Full of overfamiliar apocalyptic tropes but entertaining hokum all the same.Netflix, from Wednesday 30 AprilTurning Point: The Vietnam WarView image in fullscreenThe impact is still being felt … Turning Point: The Vietnam War.Photograph: NetflixIs there anything new to add to the discourse around the Vietnam war? Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s2017 seriesfelt definitive but it’s an itch that TV just cannot help but scratch. This latest offering marks 50 years since the war ended and benefits from an influx of Vietnamese witnesses: too often it’s a story told exclusively from an American perspective. With its exploration of the effects of the war on US national identity, it also feels piquant in the context of the current turmoil across the Atlantic – Vietnam was a generational trauma whose effects are still being felt.Netflix, from Wednesday 30 AprilExplore more on these topicsTelevisionThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This retro dessert is easy and a bit of fun, too. The result is a soft, tender apple shell filled with light, airy souffle, perfect with lashings of vanilla ice-cream (which will hopefully form a delightful puddle when served with the hot pudding). Ideal for entertaining – it’s like eating the filling of an apple pie, but lighter.Apple souffle and hazelnutsPrep10 minCook1 hrServes44 eating apples, such as braeburn20g softened unsalted butter45g caster sugar, plus extra for dusting1 tsp cornflour2 egg whites20g blanched hazelnuts, roasted and chopped, plus extra to serve, if you likeIcing sugar, to dustVanilla ice-cream, to serveCut the tops off the apples and very carefully scoop out the flesh with a small spoon or melon baller, leaving about 4mm of flesh all around the edges of the shell. Remove and discard the cores and seeds from the scooped-out flesh – you will need 180g in total. Trim the bases off the apple shells and sit them flat on a baking tray.Brush the insides of the apples with softened butter, then sprinkle in a little caster sugar and swirl to coat evenly. Put the apple shells in the fridge while you get on with the filling.Put the 180g apple flesh in a saucepan with 20g caster sugar and cook over a medium heat until completely softened. Stir in the cornflour and cook, stirring rapidly, for a few minutes, then take off the heat, blend smooth and leave to cool.Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. In a large bowl, whisk the egg whites until frothy, then add the remaining sugar bit by bit and whisk again to medium-stiff peaks. Fold the whisked egg whites into the cooled apple puree, until fully combined and smooth.Try this recipe and many more on the new Feast app: scan or clickherefor your free trial.Take the apple shells out of the fridge. Sprinkle a few chopped hazelnuts into the base of each one, then spoon in the souffle, filling the shells right to the top. Bake for 12–15 minutes, until the tops are golden brown and the souffle has risen.Garnish with more hazelnuts, if you like, sprinkle with some icing sugar and serve hot with scoops of vanilla ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsBakingThe sweet spotFoodFruitDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"
