I’m just so excited to have him on board, so much experience. I’m really looking forward to continuing.”‘Love is the key, right?’ Evergreen Venus Williams plays on and on at 45Read moreWith her hiring of Roig, Raducanu has indeed added a wealth of experience to her team. A former player with a career-high singles ranking of No 60 in 1992, Roig came to prominence as a longtime member of Rafael Nadal’s coaching team, working alongside Toni Nadal, Rafael’s uncle and coach, as the Spaniard built one of the greatest careers in the history of professional tennis. Roig himself decided to end his 18-year partnership with Nadal in 2022 and he later briefly coached the injury-prone Italian Matteo Berrettini.Although Raducanu’snumerous coaching changeshave been a big narrative in her career, this new appointment comes at a different point in her development.Raducanu has put together a consistent run of quality tennis over the past few months; she is clearly playing with confidence on the court and is in a far more positive place away from the court. The Briton had been working on an ad hoc basis with Mark Petchey since March but Petchey, who is also a broadcaster, could not fully commit to work with her on a day-to-day basis. The pair remain in close contact.Now at No 33 in the WTA rankings and 26 in the WTA race, a good showing in Cincinnati would lead to her being seeded at a grand slam tournament for the first time since her US Open points fell off. Raducanu, seeded 30th here, has received a first-round bye and will play her opening match on Saturday.After a brief trial period following her run to thethird round at Wimbledonthis year, Raducanu opted to work with Roig and they have agreed a contract until the end of the year. She is hopeful that he can help her to take another step forward: “I think I can definitely improve on a lot of my shots, just the quality of them,” Raducanu said. “I think I’ve been good at being creative, scrapping, playing the big points well, but I think the overall quality of my game needs to be better. And I see that when I play the really top players where I can’t run and scrap, wait on them to miss. I think that’s where I need to improve. And yeah, I’m hoping he can help me with that.”View image in fullscreenFrancisco Roig (left) coached Rafael Nadal for 18 years before ending the partnership in 2022.Photograph: Scott Taetsch/USA Today SportsRaducanu and Roig began their partnership with a long day of training on Tuesday, following up her morning sparring session with Rebecca Sramkova of Slovakia with an evening training session on a remote court with only Roig.There was plenty of laughter alongside their high-intensity work. Raducanu then pushed back her media duties by an hour on Wednesday to spend extra time on the practice court and she finished her day with another session.Such is the nature of professional tennis, where players and their team members spend a significant period of time together while travelling on the tour, another challenge for Raducanu and Roig will be to connect on a personal level. The vast Ohio roads may prove to be an icebreaker between them. At Cincinnati, the seeded players are given cars to drive to and from the tournament venue. “I actually drove from the airport,” the 22-year-old said.“I didn’t know I had a car, so I landed, and they were like: ‘Oh, you have a car,’ and it’s this massive Cadillac Escalade. So I’m like: ‘This is like a bus’. Obviously in England, we’re used to driving small cars, small roads, so I was a bit tight. Wrong side of the road as well. But it’s OK. I managed to get to the hotel.”Since then, Raducanu has handed over driving responsibilities to Roig. As with his coaching capabilities, her first impressions of his driving skills are positive: “So far so good,” she said, smiling.“It’s been tested too, in the dark, in the rain, in the sun. It’s fine.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Yet delusional politicians from all parties seem intent on avoiding the issueThu 7 Aug 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 12.29 EDTShareTuition fees in England go up this year for the first time in eight years and the response from universities has ranged from tepid to dismayed. It’s not hard to see why: Russell Group analysisfoundthat the new amount of £9,535 a year – an increase of £285 – is a real-terms decrease of 26% since 2017.The value of the fees has been steadily eroding since 2012, and the original figure of a maximum of £9,000 a year was artificially low for many courses anyway.Universitiesstarted off cross-subsidising expensive courses whose costs weren’t met by nine grand a student with the cheaper, classroom-based ones, mainly humanities, which were running a surplus. Within a decade, those courses – such as history, law, English – were running at or near cost.As the value of the fees deteriorated in real terms, staff pay and conditions were sacrificed to keep things afloat; by 2021, the University and College Union (UCU) found that staff pay had decreased by one-fifth since 2009. Throughout, the sometimes astronomical fees paid by foreign students underpinned what was otherwise an unaffordable model. This introduced a lot of risk into the system – from our own governments, when they have gone to war against student visas, and from world events: student numbers were hit when the Nigerian currency started struggling, an event over which UK universities had no control.Put simply, we have a really strange system in higher education, where nobody admits how much things actually cost, nobody admits who’s paying for what, research is kept alive on the toil and goodwill of underpaid academics, foreign students who represent a huge export market and an incredible success story for the sector are treated as if they are somehow on the fiddle, and that’s before you even start to consider the matter we generally look at first: what this means for graduate debt.The student loan scheme is now on its eighth iteration since it was devised by the coalition government. Originally, it was designed to be generous, to mollify the Conservatives’ Liberal Democrat partners. Steadily, the maximum term from graduation has gone up (it’s now 40 years in England before your debt is wiped, no longer 30) and theearnings thresholdat which you start paying has gone down (it’s now £25,000). Even those changes don’t protect the government from the students who will never earn enough to repay – two years after the loans were formalised, parliamentestimatedthat 40% would never fully repay. By 2018, that figure hadgone upto 83% (though analysts stressed that they might repay some, but not all).You could argue that all this is the inevitable result of charging tuition fees at all, given that students in the US also labour under an astronomical amount of debt, whichtotalled$1.7tn at the start of this year. But the conditions we have created are murkier – unwilling to accept or discuss the impact student fees would have on equality of opportunity, we chose instead to insist that all universities offered degrees of the same financial value, and all courses cost the same, and delivered the same career benefits. This has thrown up some ridiculous consequences, in which the research that gives a university its standing has become increasingly unaffordable for all but the most prestigious institutions.Unable, meanwhile, to face the political consequences of a fees hike, successive governments have clung instead to the absurd proposition that education is somehow immune to inflation.Students in England now graduate with average debt of £53,000, data showsRead moreBut “student fees aren’t the problem”, Martin Lewissaidthis week on his podcast – an astonishing remark, given the problems they are mired in, yet also true, from the perspective of the household. Whichever way you slice it, paying back fees is tomorrow’s problem for the student; living costs, by contrast, are today’s problem for the family. There’s a separate loan available, but it’s means-tested based on family income and under-25s start to lose eligibility at a household income of only £25,000. To imagine such a household having the savings available to make up any gap is just fanciful; which fits the overall picture of a system running on avoidance and delusion.A graduate tax is sometimes floated as a more progressive alternative, based as it would be on what used to be understood as a foundational principle of public policy: that wealthier people can afford to contribute more. This, along with the idea of education as a public good, which we all benefit from even if we didn’t personally undertake it, has vanished from debate; yet nothing systematic or in any way realistic has replaced it.The idea of abandoning the fees experiment altogether, meanwhile, is the stuff dreams are made of because it would be unthinkably expensive. Yet the status quo we have arrived at could hardly be called cheap, unless your idea of thrift is to break a system that’s been centuries in the making.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTuition feesOpinionUniversitiesStudentsHigher educationEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Ahead of Anemone, directed by his son Ronan, we gorge on Day-Lewis’s back catalogueByRyan GilbeyThu 7 Aug 2025 08.10 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 15.04 EDTShare21. Stars and Bars (1988)Perhaps keen not to be pigeonholed in high-fibre roles,Daniel Day-Lewistook on a pair of zany culture-clash comedies (the other was Eversmile, New Jersey) that featured him singing in a bubble bath. In Stars and Bars, he is a prim English art expert who travels to the American south to retrieve a Renoir from its owner (Harry Dean Stanton) and butts heads with various irksome oddballs. Playing the sort of nitwit that would become Hugh Grant’s meal-ticket, Day-Lewis proves that wackiness is not in his wheelhouse.20.Nine(2009)The movie of the Broadway musical of Fellini’s 8½ is one of only two duds on the Day-Lewis CV. Surrounded by dazzling female actors (Nicole Kidman, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Sophia Loren), he ends up making heavy weather of Guido, the bewildered auteur caught at a creative impasse. A light touch eludes him: he’s no Marcello Mastroianni, that’s for sure.19. Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971)Day-Lewis in Sunday Bloody Sunday.Photograph: YoutubeJohn Schlesinger’s bisexual love-triangle drama gave Day-Lewis his film debut at the age of 14. He is briefly shown sauntering along a row of parked cars, scratching the paintwork with a broken bottle. The delinquent behaviour, the insouciant look, the south London setting: this could be a teenage snapshot of Johnny from My Beautiful Laundrette.18. Nanou (1986)View image in fullscreen‘Delon-level dashing’ … Day-Lewis with Imogen Stubbs in Nanou.Photograph: Umbrella-Caulfield/Nffc/Curzon/Kobal/ShutterstockTen minutes or so of screen time doesn’t give Day-Lewis much chance to make an impression as the debonair ex of young Nanou (Imogen Stubbs). He finds her in France, where she has fallen in with a would-be terrorist, but says “au revoir” shortly after. Still, he looks Delon-level dashing in a raincoat.17. Gandhi (1982)Like Sunday Bloody Sunday, another hooligan cameo for Day-Lewis. He gets dialogue this time, all of it racist, as he tries to intimidate the young Gandhi, played by Ben Kingsley. Movies in which Day-Lewis played a more prominent role have attracted no shortage of Oscar nominations, but Gandhi is the only one of his to have walked off with the best picture prize.16.The Bounty(1984)Pauline Kael was one of Day-Lewis’s early champions but she argued that he “stuck out” and “seemed like a bad actor” in this version of Mutiny on the Bounty. In his big scene, he is furiously reprimanded by Anthony Hopkins as Captain Bligh. Equally noteworthy is the sight of Day-Lewis sharing the screen for the first time with one of his own acting heroes, Phil Davis. Also among the Bounty’s crew is the comic John Sessions: inGangs of New York, Sessions would play an actorplayingAbraham Lincoln, and getting harangued and pelted for his troubles by Day-Lewis.15. Eversmile, New Jersey (1989)View image in fullscreenUp to his teeth … in Eversmile.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn his second stab at fish-out-of-water comedy, Day-Lewis is an over-zealous Irish travelling dentist given to philosophical musings (“Did we somehow mislay our genetic memory or did God just forget to give us better teeth?”) as he brings good brushing technique to Argentina courtesy of the DuBois Foundation for the Development of Dental Consciousness. Tending to priests, peasants and gangsters alike, he roams the land on his motorcycle and sidecar, gets chased by multiple Santa Clauses, falls for a woman on the run from her wedding, and finally declares: “The world is collapsing! And I have an erection!”14. The Crucible (1996)View image in fullscreenIll-fated dalliance … Day-Lewis with Winona Ryder in The Crucible.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarPut Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder together on screen and it never works out well for their characters (see also: The Age of Innocence). In Arthur Miller’s by-the-book adaptation of his own ageless play about the Salem witch trials, Day-Lewis is the farmer John Proctor, who pays a heavy price for dallying with young Abigail (Ryder). It was through the making of the film, directed by Nicholas Hytner, that Day-Lewis first met Miller’s daughter, Rebecca, whom he married at the end of 1996, and with whom he had two of his three children, including Ronan, co-writer and director of Anemone.13. The Boxer (1997)View image in fullscreenPacking a punch … in The Boxer.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarTraining under Barry McGuigan, Day-Lewis boxed twice a day, seven days a week, for nearly three years to prepare to play the IRA soldier who embraces his pugilist roots after serving 14 years in prison. More inflammatory is his rekindled romance with his teenage sweetheart, who happens to be another prisoner’s wife, played by Emily Watson. In his third film for Jim Sheridan, Day-Lewis gives a hushed, coiled performance (he doesn’t lose his rag until the 85-minute mark). It heralded his first retirement – after this, he didn’t make another film for five years – but is not exactly what you’d call going out on a high.12.A Room with a View(1985)View image in fullscreen‘Uptight prig’ … in A Room with a View.Photograph: Goldcrest/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockCentral to the rise of Day-Lewis was the timing of this Merchant-Ivory adaptation of EM Forster’s novel, which opened immediately after My Beautiful Laundrette. Hard to imagine a better illustration of his range than the back-to-back sight of the sensually swaggering Johnny in Laundrette and the uptight prig Cecil Vyse in Room. The moment when jilted Cecil stands with his shoe in his hand was all Day-Lewis’s idea. “If you take your shoes off in a situation in which you’re vulnerable,” he said, “you’ll feel 10 times more vulnerable.” Spoken like the shoemaker he would eventually become during his first retirement.11.In the Name of the Father(1993)As Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four who were wrongly convicted and imprisoned for the 1974 IRA pub bombing, Day-Lewis goes from impish troublemaker to broken wreck and finally folk hero. Terrific to see him sharing the screen again with Phil Davis: this time, Davis is a brute putting the screws on him in the interrogation room. And the scene in which Gerry brutally castigates his father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), when the two of them are cooped up together in the same cell, remains blistering. Ultimately, this is a moral work rather than a cinematic one, and there is nothing much for Day-Lewis to play in the final hour but righteousness.10. Phantom Thread (2017)Less a coherent movie than a string of eye-catching confrontations, Day-Lewis’s second collaboration with Paul Thomas Anderson – and the catalyst for his second retirement – casts him as Reynolds Woodcock, a fastidious and imperious 1950s dressmaker. Fun though the standoffs are, especially Reynolds’s hilariously disproportionate hissy fit after his asparagus is cooked in butter rather than oil and salt, the movie is little more than an arthouse Devil Wears Prada, with Day-Lewis in Meryl Streep mode and everyone else (bar Lesley Manville, superb as his indomitable sister) running scared.9. Lincoln (2012)Day-Lewis won his third best actor Oscar for a mesmerising performance as the president trying to pass the 13th amendment, which outlawed slavery, as the civil war rages. Under Steven Spielberg’s direction, he brings a lolling looseness to lines that sound as if they’ve only just occurred to him. A simple scene depictingLincolnmeeting wounded soldiers in hospital is rendered moving by the actor’s unforced affability, his warming burr. His charisma makes you understand why the soldiers would get a kick simply from standing in his shadow.8.The Ballad of Jack and Rose(2005)Nothing to do with Titanic, the Jack and Rose here are a father and daughter, played by Day-Lewis and Camilla Belle respectively, whose off-the-grid lifestyle is jeopardised when Jack’s girlfriend (Catherine Keener) comes to stay, bringing her teenage sons (Paul Dano and Ryan McDonald). Under the direction of his wife, the novelist and film-maker Rebecca Miller, Day-Lewis exudes grumpy charm as the Scottish immigrant whose love for his daughter grows gradually suffocating and even unsavoury. Two years before he and Day-Lewis locked horns spectacularly on screen inThere Will Be Blood, Dano comes off badly in their fracas in a treehouse. It was Dano’s fine work here that prompted the senior actor to recommend him to Paul Thomas Anderson for that movie.7. The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988)View image in fullscreen‘Wry, carnivorous sexual magnetism’ … with Juliette Binoche in The Unbearable Lightness of Being.Photograph: Ronald GrantPhilip Kaufman’s ambitious film of Milan Kundera’s novel about the Prague Spring contains a lead performance for which Day-Lewis has expressed regret. Though the script was in English, he learned Czech but still found himself out of his depth as the priapic brain surgeon Tomas: “It was something to do with language. The idea of speaking English with a Czech accent meant it wasn’t coming from anywhere.” Accept that touch of inauthenticity and it’s still possible to savour Day-Lewis’s wry, carnivorous sexual magnetism, and the pitiful sight of Tomas’s spirit being crushed by the political regime and the betrayals it demands. Other pluses: that mane of liquorice-coloured hair, and the actor’s tingling rapport with Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin.6. Gangs of New York (2002)It was Leonardo DiCaprio who coaxed Day-Lewis out of his first retirement during a stroll in Central Park. The young star’s reward? To be comprehensively acted off the screen. As bullyboy William Cutting, aka Bill the Butcher, Day-Lewis isn’t merely the dominant presence in Martin Scorsese’s misshapen, mid-19th-century gangster thriller: he is its sole source of dynamism. In stove-pipe hat, flapping trenchcoat and with an American eagle printed on his glass eye, he looks like the Babadook’s sleazy uncle, giving off strong proto-Trumpian energy as he decries “the foreign hordes defiling” his land. There’s also a nice Day-Lewis Cinematic Universe crossover when he strides through a crowd of anti-Lincoln protesters and lobs a knife that hits a portrait of the president he would portray a decade later. He also gets to describe Ireland, his real-life off-screen love, as “an excrementous isle”.5. The Last of the Mohicans (1992)View image in fullscreenBorn to be wild … in The Last of the Mohicans.Photograph: Allstar Collection/Cinetext/20 C/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe method actor as matinee idol. Even those who haven’t seen Michael Mann’s stylish, swoon-worthy take on the James Fenimore Cooper novel will know the lengths to which Day-Lewis went to portray Hawkeye, adoptive son of a Mohican chief. He lived wild for weeks, ate only what he could hunt or forage, learned to load a rifle while running through the forest and built his own canoe. The North Carolina landscapes are ravishing, though they risk being upstaged by the magnificence of the actor’s mighty brow and glossy tresses as he darts among the trees in slow-mo. Then there isthatemphatic demand to Madeleine Stowe: “Stay alive, no matter what occurs! Iwillfind you!” Who could possibly disobey?4. My Beautiful Laundrette (1985)View image in fullscreen‘Brooding, funny, horny’ … with Gordon Warnecke in My Beautiful Laundrette.Photograph: Ronald Grant‘It was a buddy movie – and then they kissed’: Stephen Frears and Hanif Kureishi on My Beautiful Laundrette at 40Read moreScreenwriter Hanif Kureishi saw the influence of Clint Eastwood on Day-Lewis’s minimalist performance as Johnny, the gay former thug who helps spruce up a London launderette. Director Stephen Frears thought he was more like Marlene Dietrich. The actor described it as “the first film that I ever passionately wanted to do”. Hence the letter he wrote to Frears (“I know you think I come from a public-school background but I’ve got very nasty friends”) in which he threatened to break the director’s legs if he didn’t give him the part. It worked. As did his brooding, funny, horny performance. A star was born right there among the suds.3. The Age of Innocence (1993)View image in fullscreen‘Tortured panache’ … with Michelle Pfeiffer in The Age of Innocence.Photograph: Columbia/AllstarThe critic Jonathan Romney floated the theory that Newland Archer, the elegant lawyer played by Day-Lewis in Martin Scorsese’s rapturous adaptation of Edith Wharton’s study of late-19th century New York mores, was a “soul brother” to Jake La Motta in Raging Bull: “He simply wears fancier gloves.” There is certainly a seam of cunning and coldness in Day-Lewis’s performance, but there is boyish wonder too, especially in the gasping, enchanted laugh he lets slip whenever Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) does something irreverent or iconoclastic. As Archer tries to expedite his marriage to her cousin May (Winona Ryder) in an attempt to quell his feelings for the countess, Day-Lewis strikes and sustains a note of tortured panache.2.My Left Foot(1989)Two contradictory things are true of Jim Sheridan’s film about the artist and writer Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. One: there is no excuse for a disabled actor not to have been cast in the role. And two: Day-Lewis – who won his first Oscar for this – is astonishing in it. The first of three projects with Sheridan, this marked the beginnings of the Daniel Day-Loopy PR machine, as stories abounded of the lengths to which he went to stay authentically in character: never leaving his wheelchair, having to be carried over the cables on set, contorting his body so fiercely that he broke two ribs during filming. The movie hasn’t endured as well as it might: it ends on a happy-ever-after with Brown’s future-wife Mary Carr, who, it waslater allegedby his biographer Georgia Louise Hambleton, isolated and abused him.1. There Will Be Blood (2007)View image in fullscreenAwe-inspiring … as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood.Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe comedian Adam Riches once called Day-Lewis “the greatest actor never to appear in anyone’s favourite film”. Paul Thomas Anderson’s awe-inspiring character-study-disguised-as-an-epic gives the lie to that quip. Speaking in the corroded rumble of John Huston’s Noah Cross from Chinatown (another monstrous devourer of people and land alike), Day-Lewis is extraordinary as Daniel Plainview, a rapacious early-20th century Californian oil prospector. In a performance that can be summed up as long overcast periods interrupted by all hell breaking loose, usually with Paul Dano on the receiving end as the pipsqueak preacher who is Plainview’s sole adversary, Day-Lewis doesn’t make us like Plainview or even understand his cruelty, but we absolutely believe in him. And, as with all great monster movies, we are eager to see what he breaks next. After nearly three hours in his company, audiences are likely to develop a severe case of Stockholm syndrome.Explore more on these topicsRankedDaniel Day-LewisPhantom ThreadLincolnGangs of New YorkThe Last of the MohicansThe Age of InnocencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He discusses songwriting, his recent memoirs, the problems with modern politics and why we all need to open upThu 7 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 09.45 EDTShareOn a muggy summer day,Adam Buxtonis talking me through the songs on his debut album, Buckle Up. “There’s one on there called Standing Still,” he says, “which was written when I was feeling absolutely bleak and lost and is about opening a packet of pasta when all the pasta spills. I thought: ‘You can get a joke in there about being a fusilli billy and maybe that will distract a bit from the more earnest and pain-laden lyrics about how, every morning, I drink a cup of tea and it helps me with all the thoughts I have to smother.’”What are these thoughts? “I get overwhelmed by the world and, the worse the news gets, the harder it bites,” he says. “I get existential fear and I think I should go and join Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and work with them. But then, is that really the best use of my talents? My wife is like: ‘Please don’t join MSF. It’s really helpful to have you around here. And, also, I think you’re good at doing your podcast and that helps people.’”Buxton, 56, cuts a pensive figure as he strokes his grey-streaked beard. He has travelled to the Guardian’s London offices from his home in Norfolk, where he lives with Sarah, their three children and their dog Rosie, who regularly features on his podcast. The Adam Buxton Show began in 2015, the year that his longstanding comedy partner,Joe Cornish, went off to make movies. During Covid, at a time when people were more isolated and atomised than ever, Buxton’s gentle, affable chat won a vast and loyal fanbase.Conversation is important to Buxton. He was raised in west London by his journalist father, Nigel, who was travel editor of the Sunday Telegraph, and Chilean mother, Valerie. He has described his dad as “gruff, pompous, conservative and harshly critical of nearly everything I enjoyed as a youngster and beyond”, while his mum was his “ally”, someone who squared up to his father and encouraged Buxton’s love of music and eventual TV and comedy career.“Watching my parents, the problem was they didn’t talk enough,” he says. “Stubbornness, pride and hurt feelings prevented them. It’s probably why I feel it’s ultimately a good thing to talk more rather than less … Sometimes I feel I overshare and sometimes I can hear my dad or even my mum going, ‘It’s too much – say less.’”View image in fullscreenThe Buxton family circa 1981. Left to right: David, Nigel (worried that the photographer is aiming too low), Adam, Valerie and Clare.Photograph: Courtesy of Adam BuxtonBuxton’s readiness to talk about his own life encourages his podcast guests to let their guard down. His friend Louis Theroux opened up about his drinking problems, admitting that during the pandemic he would regularly be parenting his three sons hungover. “I did sometimes wonder if you could do the job drunk,” he told Buxton. “Maybe that’s controversial, but I’m going to say yes.” Singer Pauline Black talked about performing in front of skinheads who were on speed in the 1970s and constantly fearing racist violence. Zadie Smith reflected on the “death terror” that inspires her. How does Buxton approach such a wide range of guests? “I’m always just looking for a moment of genuine connection,” he says.The guests aren’t all celebrities. The Syrian refugee Hassan Akkad described being detained and tortured by the police for attending a protest, then paying smugglers to take him on a dinghy from Turkey to Greece. Once the overfilled boat began to sink, he swam for seven hours to make it to Lesbos.“It’s valuable for people to be able to talk to each other about complicated things,” Buxton says. “I grew up in a house with parents who I didn’t agree with politically, but that didn’t stop me loving them. The problem now is that people are very prepared to think the worst of anyone. That seems to be the default position, to read the most bad-faith version of whatever’s going on in the situation.”Over the past few years, for the first time, he’s had some permanent fallings out with friends over politics. “It was really shocking when it happened, because I sat down with them and tried to get past it,” he says. “‘Surely we can talk about it?’ I said. ‘We’ve got too much in common.’ And it was so upsetting and frightening when it was apparent that we couldn’t. It completely threw me for a loop for a while.”View image in fullscreen‘Me, Joe and Louis in 1995, aged about 26, enjoying our traditional Christmas Eve get-together at my parents’ place in Clapham.’Photograph: Courtesy of Adam BuxtonHe has written two memoirs: Ramble Book, published in 2020, about his life in the 1980s and the death of his father in 2015; and 2025’s I Love You, Byeee, which covers his TV career in the 1990s and the death of his mother in 2020. He spent nine months caring for his father after he was diagnosed with cancer. “Before he moved in, I’d imagined conversations filled with tender reminiscences, confessions and closure,” he writes. “In the end, we were just two uptight men who found it easier to be on our own.”His mother’s death felt more sudden, despite her health deteriorating over a number of years. “The ones who really love you, you end up taking for granted,” he told Cornish in a podcast episode recorded a few months later. “I just had it in my head that we were going to have another chapter and she would be with us. I was totally sideswiped by her death.”Hearing him grapple with his bereavement has helped me with my own grief over the death of my mother. At the end of I Love You, Byeee, he thanks his mother for loving him and apologises for not taking the time to talk to her more about her life. It’s a regret I’ve often had myself, holding on to questions that will now never be answered, and there is a comfort in hearing that expressed by someone else. How is he coping now? “I feel as if I’ve really been in the hole with grief for ages, looking through photos, thinking about it, talking to relatives, maybe spending too much time there and not moving on sufficiently,” he says. “I really miss them and that doesn’t go away. I’m surprised how much that doesn’t go away.”He is still haunted by one song that reminds him of his mother, Randy Crawford’s One Day I’ll Fly Away. “I listened to that song the night after she died, since it’s one of her favourites, but this time I suddenly heard such darkness in it,” he says. “She sings, ‘I follow the night / Can’t stand the light / When will I begin / My life again?’ and it made me think of where my mum might be and I began to feel so fearful. There’s grief and then there’s fear and the fear is worse.”View image in fullscreenCornish and Buxton met at Westminster school in London, and went on to form a comedy duo.Photograph: Tony Kyriacou/ShutterstockBuxton went to the fee-paying Westminster school in London, which is where he became friends with Theroux and Cornish. It was while studying at Cheltenham College of Art that he began tinkering with the self-filmed sketches he sent to the Channel 4 show Takeover TV, and which formed the basis for the Adam and Joe Show. This began in 1996, and included everything from a toy-themed recreation of The English Patient, to Buxton’s father being filmed as he explored the nightclubs of Ibiza. At a time when shows such as Spitting Image and Brass Eye were skewering politicians and celebrities, Buxton and Cornish preferred to make fun of themselves.The show was axed after four series, and the pair went on to work together on the radio. With the 30th anniversary of the Adam and Joe Show coming up, does he think they will ever make another TV series?View image in fullscreenThe Adam and Joe Show.Photograph: Channel 4“Never say never, but it would be quite weird,” he says. “Over the years, we’ve discovered the podcast is a good medium for us because we know how we fit together in that world. We do the Christmas podcast together every year and I don’t think that’s going to stop anytime soon.”With a new celebrity-fronted interview podcast seemingly popping up every week, does he worry about the future of his show? “I don’t think about it really,” he says. “I’m not on social media, I don’t check numbers and I gauge it by whether I’m still getting sponsors. I do sometimes think, if the sponsors went away and it wasn’t financially worthwhile, would I still do it? And I think I would. It is fun. I’ll probably only stop when Rosie dies.”View image in fullscreen‘I’m not on social media, I don’t check numbers’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianFrom 2007 to 2009, he co-hosted a BBC Radio 6 Music show with Cornish, which included jokey radio jingles. He sees his album as a natural progression for this musical tinkering – a selection of “proper music” with a funny edge, written by him over five years and produced by Joe Mount of indie group Metronomy. The 15 tracks span everything, from fast-paced electropop about sitting on the moral fence (Dancing in the Middle) to 1970s Brazilian bossa about drying the dishes (Tea Towel), Dylanesque folk singing about differing musical tastes (Skip This Track) and thundering jungle breakbeats for a love letter to wearing shorts (Shorts).Comedian John Tothill: ‘My second near-death experience? I blame the bedtime cheesy chips’Read moreThis solo project puts him centre stage, but he is still keen to work with others. “I like anything where it’s collegiate and you have an experience with people,” he says. “That’s why I always wanted to go into the [I’m A Celebrity] jungle. Now I do get offers to go in there but I think I’m too old. I don’t know if I could hack it physically.”What if they offered you a million pounds? “It’s not about the money, man – it’s about the experience,” he laughs. “I’d do it for free if the right people were in there.”He’s also keen to act more: in 2007, he was cast in Edgar Wright’s romp Hot Fuzz, where he played a local journalist who meets a grisly end. “I’m hoping I might be entering my more castable years as an older man. It might be easier to slot me into a few creepy old guy roles. That’s the dream: get a part on a show that ends up doing really well. You just show up, you don’t have to write it and you don’t have to worry about it, just hang out with talented people. That would be really good.”Adam Buxton’s new single Doing It Wrong is out on Decca.

Ahead of him moving in, I said we could live together but that he needed to find somewhere else to work so we weren’t on top of each other.We’d both moved here from other countries, and I think it’s healthy to carry on meeting people and not just live in a couple bubble. I asked him to find a co-working space to help us keep a balanced, healthy relationship.Also, when I wake up, I don’t want to speak for a while. Because I work remotely for a client who doesn’t need me until 1pm, my mornings are my solo time. Having Xavier in my flat all day every day isn’t an option.My job is 90% calls, so it had to be him that left. Also, it’s my flat, and he was the one who proposed moving in. Luckily, we are super compatible as flatmates, but this was my condition.I like to have different spaces for work, sleep and socialising, but Xavier doesn’t think like that. He can get up, start work straight away at the kitchen table and then leave the house when he’s done. He likes to do all his work-related activities indoors, then socialise outdoors.Luckily, there are no issues between us when it comes to living together apart from thisIt took Xavier a while to commit to a co-working space. Before that, he was hanging around at home. One day, a month after we started living together, he wanted to take a call at the flat. I said it was fine, but actually it was annoying. Later, we had to have a conversation about why I was irritated, and he joined a co-working space right after that.I like to talk about issues that arise right away, whereas Xavier will avoid things and hope they’ll disappear. I need to be understood, whereas he can just suppress things. Luckily, there are no other issues between us when it comes to living together. But I think it’s important to have boundaries.Xavier can work from home occasionally, but I’d prefer it if he stuck to the routine and came back in the afternoon while I’m working and not when I want to relax alone in the morning. It’s important to have separation as a couple.You be the judge – send us your domestic disputesRead moreThe defence: XavierI’m more productive working from home. I wake up, have a coffee and start straight awayAbout a month after I moved into Claire’s flat, she told me I needed to go to a co-working space. We both work remotely, and when I moved in she did mention this stipulation. We’ve only been dating a year, and she didn’t want us to be on top of each other.I dragged my heels because I’d never been to a co-working space; I’d always worked at home. I’m more productive that way. I wake up, have a coffee and start work straight away. I like starting early and finishing by 2 or 3pm, and having my own space, with my food, snacks and a toilet all close by.Claire starts at 1pm, so I originally thought: great I’ll work in our flat until she needs the office, and pop into a co-working space now and again. But then, about 10 days into this routine, she sat me down and said it wasn’t working, that she wanted me to work outside of the flat consistently.So now I have to pack my bag, walk to a co-working space, and speak to people, all because Claire wants me out. I don’t like it. I get up at 7am and my productivity starts at 100%. Every little thing I do before working detracts from that – it drops off bit by bit.I have managed to find a more corporate, soulless co-working space that is less sociable and suits meClaire said she wanted her space in the mornings. She doesn’t talk much, whereas I am a morning person. I didn’t think I was disturbing her, but she said it was more about having space to just exist away from me in the day. I wasn’t offended, but I didn’t like having to find a co-working spot right away. I needed to work out what I liked and what I wanted out of one – it’s not easy.I tried one place and it was way too social. Everyone said “hi” every five minutes, and my productivity was affected.Claire is a very open communicator, and I’m glad she told me she wanted me out of the flat. And I have managed to find a more corporate, soulless co-working space that is less sociable and suits me.In some ways, my working there makes our lives more interesting, because I come home with news about my day. But sometimes I wish I had a bit more freedom to be in the flat because it’s my home, too.The jury of Guardian readersShould Xavier let Claire have the space to herself?Claire wants Xavier to live on her terms and offers no flexibility. The mention of “her flat” makes it feel as if she hasn’t embraced living together as a couple. He is asking for more freedom in his own home, which seems a reasonable request.Robbie, 35If working elsewhere was a condition of moving in, Xavier needs to stick to it. But Claire needs to remember that this is Xavier’s home too now – he’s allowed to be there during the day. Flexibility on her side would help ease this issue.Rose, 40There seems to be a disparity in the equality dynamic and a disconnect in the relationship harmony. Claire is pulling rank because it’s “her flat” and seems to be insinuating that her needs are more important than his so Xavier should change. Compromise is called for.Naomi, 72Covid taught us that spending 24 hours together is not healthy, particularly for a relatively new couple. Claire could compromise and agree on some occasions when Xavier can work from home, but I am with her when she talks about needing space and quiet in the morning.Silvia, 53It doesn’t seem as if it would take long for Xavier to walk to his work space, so I don’t buy the argument that every second wasted between waking and working drains him of productivity. It also sounds a bit awful to have your boyfriend get up at 7am and start working on your kitchen table.

The government’s limited options were further emphasised this week when the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said“moderate but sustained” tax rises would be neededin the budget for Reeves to overcome a deficit of £41.2bn and restore a near-£10bn buffer.No date has been set for the budget, which was held last year on 30 October, but government sources expect that it will be in November, giving the chancellor a little longer to roll the pitch for controversial tax rises or cuts – as well as hoped-for improvements in growth.Advisers believe that a “no surprises” approach will be crucial to prevent negative market reaction. “Last year was a model of how to do it,” one said. “Had we done it otherwise, it would have been a mess.”Sources pointed towards the early signs Reeves gave to the markets more than a month before her budget last year that she planned to change her fiscal rules around borrowing to invest – and said there would be a similar approach this time.However, Labour was roundly attacked by business leaders afterwards forfailing to warn about a £25bn increasein employer national insurance contributions (NICs), with companies including Tesco and Boots warning that it would raise their costs by £7bn and lead to higher prices and job cuts.View image in fullscreenGordon Brown (left) and Keir Starmer. Brown has advocated spending funds raised from parts of the gambling industry on lifting the two-child benefit cap.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAStarmer has spent the week in Chequers meeting key aides and ministers as he begins work on his conference speech. The prime minister is understood to be keen to spend much of the summer thinking about the longer-term major structural problems in the UK economy that the party failed to identify before the election: the sources of low economic growth and productivity.Strategists also believe that the budget should be a moment to make the argument that Britain must now make serious choices on growth and productivity. They say Starmer must forcefully rebut the charges that the poor state of the economy is down to individual tax and spend choices, but is a sign of the weakness of the economy’s fundamentals.The budget, they believe, should be a moment to set out the hard road of reforms to tackle those issues.Reeves and Starmer are understood to have agreed some broad principles for the budget and the Treasury will begin to submit ideas to Downing Street towards the end of the month.But sources close to Reeves said she is unmoved on her two main pledges – there will be no rise in income tax, national insurance or VAT and no change to the fiscal rules.One tax rise that is near certain is a change to gambling levies, despite a massive lobbying offensive by the industry. Brown has urged Reeves to spend funds from raising taxes on parts of the gambling industry on lifting the two-child benefit cap, a measure likely to be made even more expensive by higher inflation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the decision was a close call, with the rate-setting panel for the first time in history holding two votes before reaching its verdict.Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said: “We’ve cut interest rates today, but it was a finely balanced decision.Interest ratesare still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.”Reeves sought to claim credit for the cut, as she claimed Labour’s economic management had helped Threadneedle Street to reduce borrowing costs five times from a peak of 5.25% in August last year.“The stability we have brought to the public finances through our plan for change has helped make this possible,” she said.However, the MPC warned tax-raising measures in the chancellor’s first autumn budget had contributed to the rekindling of inflationary pressures hitting shoppers in the pocket across the country.Bailey warned that rising inflation could delay further rate cuts in future. “I do think the path continues to be down,” he said. “[But] the path has become more uncertain because of what we’re seeing.”City investors pared their bets for the timing of future rate cuts, with financial markets expecting a next quarter-point move in February and only one more similar reduction before the end of 2026.Reeves said reducing child poverty was a priority of the government but did not commit that any money from higher gambling levies would be spent on removing the two-child limit. The child poverty taskforce is expected to be released before the budget this autumn.“I talk to Gordon [Brown] regularly, and saw him last week when I was in Scotland,” Reeves said on Thursday. “Like Gordon, I am deeply concerned around the levels of child poverty in Britain. No child should grow up hungry or parents not be able to afford the basics for their family.“On gambling taxes, we’ve already launched a review into gambling taxes. We’re taking evidence on that at the moment, and again, we’ll set out our policies in the normal way, in our budget later this year.”Inside No 10 and the Treasury there was fury at the predictions of a £51bn hole in Reeves’ budget by the NIESR thinktank, which aides say is impossible to calculate at the moment given that the budget could be another four months away.But there are fears in other parts of government about how boxed in the government has become, when Reeves has also appeared to rule out a wealth tax. “I am at a loss really how they square the circle,” one Whitehall source said. “It will have to be salami slicing small pieces here and there, when what we should do is bite the bullet.”At the Bank of England’s press conference on Thursday, the MPC singled out fast-rising food prices as it warned that food price inflation was on track to reach 5.5% before the end of the year. It attributed much of the rise to global factors, including increasingly extreme weather events hitting cocoa and coffee harvests, highlighting the dangers from the climate emergency.However, it also pointed to “material” rises in employment costs and new charges for recycling packaging, both driven by the government, that were being passed on to shoppers by UK supermarkets.“In addition to global agricultural commodity prices, domestic labour costs are currently an important driver of food price inflation,” the Bank said.Business leaders had warned that Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer NICs and a 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” from April would force them to cut jobs and put up prices.Official figures show unemployment has crept higher in recent months, while the economy shrank in April and May.Inflationhas also risen by more than expected, reaching 3.6% in June.Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingRachel ReevesInterest ratesEconomicsEconomic policyBank of EnglandKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

But this was not discussed. The Russian side left this option completely without comment.”No venue was given for the potential bilateral summit but Putin, who was meeting Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the leader of the United Arab Emirates, in the Kremlin, suggested the UAE could be a suitable place to hold the talks. “We have many friends who are willing to help us organise such events. One of our friends is the president of the United Arab Emirates,” he said.The prospect of Putin and Trump trying to come to an agreement on Ukraine with no one else in the room is likely to alarm Kyiv and European capitals, who have consistently said that Ukraine must be present for discussions about its fate.By contrast, Russia favours the idea of a “great powers summit” at which it could try to negotiate with Trump over the heads of Europeans. Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin economic adviser, said the meeting would be a good opportunity to directly talk to Trump to prevent “misinformation” about Russia that other countries were using to influence the US president. The summit could become “an important historic event”, he claimed.Trump called Zelenskyy after Witkoff left Russia on Wednesday. The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, and several European leaders were also on the line.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin welcomes Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff for a meeting in Moscow on Wednesday.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/ReutersOn Thursday, Zelenskyy was careful not to criticise Trump but said he would spend the day speaking with European allies. “We in Ukraine have repeatedly said that the search for real solutions can become truly effective only at the level of leaders. We need to decide on the time for such a format, with a range of issues,” he wrote in a Telegram post.Later, he said he had spoken with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “I gave [Macron] our Ukrainian view of the talk between President Trump and European colleagues,” he said. “We are coordinating our positions and we both understand the need for a common European vision of key European security issues.”Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for direct discussions with Putin, with either Trump or the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as a mediator. Putin has so far dismissed the possibility, suggesting that lower-level negotiation groups should come to an agreement first. However, little progress has been made at a series of direct talks in Turkey, with Moscow sending a junior delegation and not appearing ready for real talks.In recent weeks, Trump had appeared to take a tougher line with Moscow for the first time in his presidency, calling continued Russian attacks against civilian targets in Ukraine “disgusting” and promising the introduction of new sanctions ifprogress towards a deal was not madeby a deadline of this Friday.White House officials have said sanctions were still expected and on Wednesday additional tariffs were announced for India, based on the country’s buying of Russian oil. At the same time, however, Trump seemed satisfied with the outcome of Witkoff’s talks.Ushakov said the discussions had been “businesslike” and claimed they focused on a bright future of cooperation between Washington and Moscow. “It was reaffirmed that Russian-US relations could be based on a completely different, mutually advantageous scenario, which drastically differs from how they developed in recent years,” he said.Trump said on Wednesday evening the meeting could happen “very soon”. Some others in Washington seemed less sure. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said a meeting could take place soon, “but obviously a lot has to happen before that can occur”.If it goes ahead, it would be the first US-Russia leaders’ summit sinceJoe Biden met Putin in Genevain 2021.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

She had been under pressure to explain the contradiction between the stated reason for ending the tenancy and the decision to re-let the home at a higher price after no buyer was found.In a letter to Keir Starmer, theLabourMP said she had “at all times” followed “all legal requirements” and taken her responsibilities “seriously”.But she added: “It is clear that continuing in my role will be a distraction from the ambitious work of the government. I have therefore decided to resign from my ministerial position.”In response, the prime minister thanked Ali for her “diligent work” at the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government, saying it would have “a lasting impact”.Starmer swiftly responded to her resignation letter and said: “I know you will continue to support the government from the backbenches and represent the best interests of your constituents in Bethnal Green and Stepney.”Ali had been widely criticised for apparent hypocrisy. She has spoken out against private renters being exploited and said the Labour government would “empower people to challenge unreasonable rent increases”.Therenters’ rights bill, which is due to come into force next year, will ban landlords who have ended a tenancy in order to sell a property from relisting it for a higher rent. The bill will also end the use of fixed-term tenancies.Kevin Hollinrake, the Conservative party chair, accused Starmer of presiding over “a government of hypocrisy and self-service”.He said: “It is right that Rushanara Ali has now quit the government following our calls for her to go.“Keir Starmer promised a government of integrity but has instead presided over a government of hypocrisy and self-service. Once again it’s one rule for Labour and one for everyone else.“With a fourth minister now having to step down in disgrace, it is clear the British public deserve so much better than the endless sleaze and scandal of this Labour government.”Peter Wishart, the Scottish National party’s deputy leader at Westminster, said earlier on Thursday: “Once this shameful story broke, Labour’s homelessness minister should have immediately resigned.”Jess Barnard, a former chair of Young Labour and a member of Labour’s national executive committee, said: “Seems an appropriate time to reiterate MPs should not be landlords and landlords should not be Labour MPs.”Mairi MacRae, the director of campaigns and policy at Shelter, said: “It beggars belief that after months of dither and delay, the government’s own homelessness minister has profited from the underhand tactics the renters’ rights bill is meant to outlaw.“This story serves as a damning reminder that the cards are fundamentally stacked against renters. Unscrupulous landlords cannot be allowed to continue the practice of ‘fire-and-rehire’ evictions, where they slap renters with a section 21 only to hike up the rent a few months later and relet the property at a higher price.”A spokesperson for Ali said on Thursday afternoon: “The tenants stayed for the entirety of their fixed-term contract and were informed they could stay beyond the expiration of the fixed term while the property remained on the market, but this was not taken up and they decided to leave the property.”It is understood that after an end-of-tenancy inventory was carried out, the managing agent requested payment from the tenants to cover the costs of repairs. This was not authorised by Ali and was cancelled after she intervened.The house, near Ali’s Bethnal Green and Stepney constituency, is listed for sale at £894,995. The property was reportedly put up for sale last November and the price was reduced in February.Explore more on these topicsLabourHousingCommunitiesHomelessnessRenting propertyPropertySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

They are alarmed by companies gaining “corporate reach” in schools by supplying teacher resource packs and student information sheets that they claim constitute “misleading and harmful classroom materials”.“We wouldn’t let big tobacco teach children about smoking. So why are we allowing the alcohol, gambling and junk food industries into classrooms?” said Chris van Tulleken, a professor of infectious disease and global health at University College London. “Allowing these industries into schools distorts learning and helps industry establish the next generation of customers.”The coalition of 58 health experts, groups and academics wants Phillipson to adopt the same tough approach as the Republic of Ireland. In 2022its government told schoolsnot to use materials in the classroom that had been funded by the alcohol industry or other “parties with conflicts of interest”.Academic studies have found that “self-claimed prevention education programmes … serve the interests of their commercial funders. The materials help to normalise harmful behaviours, omit or misrepresent important risks, and shift responsibility for harm on to individuals, including children and young people, and away from the industries and their practices.”Dr May van Schalkwyk, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh and expert in corporate tactics, said: “The evidence is clear. Industries whose products are undermining the health and wellbeing of children and young people fund harmful youth education programmes as part of their corporate strategies. Urgent action is needed to prevent this form of influence and conflicts of interest”.The letter highlights examples of how the alcohol, gambling and junk food industries have been gaining influence in schools by supplying sponsored resources.It claims that Smashed, a play about underage drinking sponsored by drinks firm Diageo used in PSHE lessons, contains “cancer misinformation, for instance omitting the most common forms of alcohol-related cancer or suggesting alcohol-related cancers are only associated with heavy drinking”.The letter also alleges that Gamble Aware, an industry-funded charity, has produced “educational materials that promote the industry-favoured idea of ‘responsible gambling’. These introduce young people to gambling products and may facilitate gambling initiations, for example by teaching students how to use a betting slip.”In addition, “in some sixth-form colleges, brands like Costa Coffee and Starbucks have set up entire outlets that sell items packed with sugar”, the letter adds. Zoe Osmond, Gamble Aware’s chief executive, said it commissions “a broad range of independently designed and delivered education programmes, which are evaluated using transparent criteria by independent researchers.“We only ever commission activity aimed to raise awareness of the risks of gambling and direct people to appropriate support and treatment. It is inaccurate and irresponsible to suggest otherwise.”Drinkaware said it no longer sponsors materials for schools. “The education programme referenced in the letter [about how to pour drinks] was wound down in 2019, six years ago and three years before the academic paper cited was published”, a spokesperson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the duties were “unacceptable blackmail”.Switzerland said it was seeking new talks with the US after a last-gasp mission to Washington by its president, Karin Keller-Sutter, failed to stop a 39% tariff blow that industry group Swissmem described as a “horror scenario”.In a statement after an emergency meeting with Keller-Sutter, the Swiss cabinet said the tariffs would “place a substantial strain on Switzerland’s export-oriented economy”.“For the affected sectors, companies and their employees, this is an extraordinarily difficult situation,” Keller-Sutter told reporters.Taiwan is also continuing talks with the US. Its president, Lai Ching-te, said the 20% rate imposed on the key Washington ally was “temporary”.Ireland, which is locked into an EU-US deal setting the tariff ceiling at 15%, said it would publish a new plan for diversifying an economy that relies heavily on US multinationals including Intel, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, all in Trump’s crosshairs.Despite a last minute reprieve from Trump for Lesotho with tariffs dropping from 50% to 15%, the impoverished African nation said it was already hurting.Textile industry players in the country – which produces jeans and other garments for US companies including Levi and Walmart – said the uncertainty around tariffs over the past few months had already devastated the sector, with orders cancelled and jobs cut.Laos, which, like Brazil and Myanmar, was hit with a 40% rate, was among those handed a steep increase in import duties because of a trade imbalance with the US.“A 40% tariff is just a nail in the coffin for any industry trying to ship to the United States,” Johannes Somers, the executive chair of the garment manufacturing firm Diep Vu, told Agence France Presse.“We estimate about 20,000 workers or more could be impacted,” added Xaybandith Rasphone, the head of the Association of the Lao Garment Industry.The sweeping “reciprocal” rates wereannounced by the White House a week ago, just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse.Just before the tariffs came into effect at midnight, Trump claimed on social media that billions of dollars would start flowing into the US as a result.However, while the customs duties make countries’ exports more expensive and less competitive, they are payable on import and usually passed on to the customer.“The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail,” the president wrote in capital letters, referencing an ongoingcase in the US court of appeals, which is considering whether he exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs.Some trading partners had already secured reductions through negotiations or by striking deals, including the UK, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and the EU.Toyota warns of £7.1bn hit from Trump tariffs as it cuts profit forecastRead moreThe EU is the only trading partner whereits baseline rate of 15%will include previous tariffs. It means, for example, cheeses that are normally hit with import duties of 14.9% will be taxed at 15% and not 29.9%.However, the deal has only been implemented in part with tariffs of 27.5% still being imposed on EU car imports while the details of the US-EU deal are being finalised.Hildegard Müller, the president of the German car industry federation, said the EU-US deal had “brought no clarity or improvement” to the industry.“The sectoral tariffs on cars and automotive parts of 27.5%, which have been in effect since April and May respectively, remain in place and place a significant burden on German automakers and automotive suppliers, as well as on transatlantic trade.“It is important that the promised agreement is reached now and the relief measures are implemented promptly,” she said.India’s 25% tariff rate could rise to a total of 50% after Trump signed an executive order on Wednesdayimposing an additional levyin retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil from Russia. Delhi has 21 days to respond. Trump has threatened to use the same tactic on other countries that supply Russia.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaIndiaIrelandSwitzerlandnewsShareReuse this content"

A small contribution from each charger creates a big saving for the grid,” he said.SNRG is pursuing other similar projects across the country, but Otterpool is the most advanced, Nicholls added.Jim Martin, the leader of Folkestone and Hythe district council, described the plans as “a perfect example of what can be delivered using renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions”.“While the solar park is subject to a planning application, which will of course enable the public to give their views and allow further scrutiny by councillors, the prospect of generating green power on land already owned by the council and at no cost to local taxpayers is very attractive,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyKentEnergy (Environment)Energy (Technology)HousingNational GridnewsShareReuse this content"

But within days there was a mistake when the new spy plane was revealed to be circling over Khan Younis on 28 July.Until that time the spy planes’ transponders were turned off halfway into their flight from Akrotiri heading towards Gaza over the eastern Mediterranean. But the mistake meant that “the RAF (now contracted) flights could be confirmed over Gaza, not just adjacent to Gaza,” said the flight tracker and analyst Steffan Watkins.A subsequent tightening of security has made tracking flights more complicated, though on 3, 4, and 6 August the spy plane turned its transponders on and off before leaving Akrotiri, Watkins added.RAF Shadows are used for optical surveillance, day or night, often in support of SAS operations. One defence source said they were being “trained on individual buildings” in Gaza in an attempt to determine if there was any signs of life from the 20 hostages still thought to be alive.Jeremy Corbyn, the co-leader of an unnamed new left political party, said “the UK’s continued military cooperation with Israel is utterly indefensible” as “a genocide is livestreamed around the world”. The former Labour leader said: “We still don’t know why these flights are continuing and what intelligence is being provided.”Helen Maguire, the defence spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said while she supported UK efforts to locate the remaining hostages, “the government must outline what steps it has taken to ensure Israel can’t use UK-sourced intelligence for its military operations in Gaza”.The surveillance flights were first announced by the former defence secretary Grant Shapps in December 2023, in support of Israel, a country with a sophisticated intelligence operation of its own. No detail has been provided as to how the spy planes assisted Israel, which has rescued eight hostages since October 2023.The UK government says it takes careful steps to control what it shares with Israel. Asked specifically about the surveillance flights last month, the foreign secretary,David Lammy, said: “It would be quite wrong for the British government to assist in the prosecution of this war in Gaza. We are not doing that. I would never do that.”How exactly has Britain supported Israel’s military assault on Gaza? The public has a right to know | Jeremy CorbynRead moreMilitary insiders said a normal process for sharing UK intelligence with Israel or another foreign country would include checks from a political adviser (a trained civil servant) and a lawyer in an exercise that one said could take “minutes, hours or days”.The British source added “why on earth would we want to get involved in a conflict where there are accusations of genocide and breaches of international humanitarian law?” while adding that if Richard Hermer, the attorney general, had raised serious concerns it would be unlikely the flights would continue.Passing on information of military utility to Israel would arguably make the UK a party to the ongoing war, though once passed over the use to which intelligence can be put by a third party cannot be completely controlled.The Labour backbencher Kim Johnson said it was “deeply concerning that surveillance flights over Gaza continue relentlessly, even as serious questions remain about their purpose and oversight – particularly when we’ve spent months demanding an end to the use of RAF Akrotiri to share intelligence with Israel during its genocidal onslaught on Gaza”.The Ministry of Defence did not comment, but indicated that it was conducting unarmed surveillance flights over Gaza for the purpose of locating hostages and that it controls what information is passed to Israeli authorities. The Attorney General’s Office said it did not comment on legal advice provided to other ministers.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyIsrael-Gaza warCyprusKeir StarmerDavid LammyRoyal Air ForceMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s like kind of a new understanding over the last 10 or 15 years, you don’t deride people for what they look like,” the 5ft 4in actor, 78, told Elizabeth Day’sHow to Failpodcast, admitting he had seen his shorter than average height as a problem in life.Studies over decades show heightism leads to bias, yet it appears even today to be more socially acceptable than other forms of physical prejudice.The term “heightism” was first coined by the sociologist Saul Feldman in 1971. Dr Erin Pritchard, a senior lecturer in sociology and disability studies at Liverpool Hope University, believes much heightism is subconscious, but that it is ingrained. It has also not benefited from widespread acceptance movements.“You had the fat acceptance movement, and while there’s still issues, you would never go, ‘well, how much do you weigh’? But it’s perfectly acceptable for people to go, ‘how tall are you’?” she said.It is reinforced through popular culture, “chicken and egg, I suppose. But you’re seeing it in films and in TV shows, jokes about short man syndrome,” she said. “Height is all about power, isn’t it? It’s quite a powerful thing.”And it is present in everyday language. We tell people to “walk tall”; we “look up to” people; those respected “have stature”; those less so “have shortcomings” or “fall short”.The US state of Michigan, the US cities Santa Cruz, San Francisco and New York City, as well as Ontario, Canada and Victoria, Australia, are among the few to address height discrimination in civil rights law.An increase in men’s height corresponds to increased income, according to a2004 studypublished in the Journal of Applied Psychology. The term “height premium” emerged from another 2004 study, which found an 1.8% increase in men’s wages accompanies every additional inch [2.54cm] of height, and that men’s wages as adults could be linked to their height at age 16.Women prefer a larger height difference between themselves and male partners, according to a2013 studyat the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, and were most satisfied when their partner was 21cm taller. Men, however, preferred an 8cm difference over female partners.There was a lighthearted, body positive movement during the 2022 TikTok “short king spring”, in praise of short men. But then a2023 studysuggested “short man syndrome”, often referred to as the Napoleon complex, may lead short men to compensate with antagonistic behaviours.The study claims evidence of “such a complex in those characterised by the dark triad traits of psychopathy (ie, callousness, criminality), narcissism (ie, inflated sense of self, grandiosity), and Machiavellianism (ie pragmatic cynicism, duplicity).”However, being too tall also attracts the unwelcome. The 6ft 7in comedian and actor Stephen Merchant has spoken of his weariness at relentless comments. Trying to be funny was a way of taking ownership of standing out. “If people are going to look at you, they may as well look at you and think what you are doing is good or funny or entertaining rather than just pointing and laughing. I guess I was a nerd and I felt a bit awkward because I was 6ft 7in even from a young age,” he told Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs.The actor Geena Davis knocked two inches off her 6ft height to get accepted by modelling agencies in her youth. Miranda Hart, the Call the Midwife star, has said she is fed up with being defined by her 6ft 1in height. Nicole Kidman, at 5ft 11in, used to shave half an inch off to get auditions.A studyof taller than average female college students found it resulted in unintended intimidation.Robert Reich, Bill Clinton’s labor secretary, a Rhodes Scholar, and one of Time magazine’s 10 best cabinet members of the century, is 4ft 11in an issue he publicly addressedin a blogpost.“When it comes to choosing leaders, our society is exceptionally heightist and seems to be getting more so. My dear friend and mentor, the late economist John Kenneth Galbraith, was 6ft 8. He once said that favouring the tall was ‘one of the most blatant and forgiven prejudices in our society’.”But he added: “I’m fortunate to have grown up (or at least grown upward) in a society that, more and more, values brains over brawn. There are still bullies in the world, of course. But in a civil society, those bullies can be stopped with words and ideas. At least, that’s been my faith. That’s how I’ve tried to compensate for my short height.”Prichard said: “We need more voices like Tony Robinson coming out and saying it, to show this is not all woke nonsense, [to] just sort of sit down and listen to what they have to say and go, OK, these are their lived experiences.”Explore more on these topicsMenDatingOnline datingRelationshipsWomenTindernewsShareReuse this content"

But there was every chance it would get a lot busier. Outside Zamzam, the notorious Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group was massing on three sides, preparing for a possible ground assault.Some believed the RSF might hold off. Even for a groupaccused of genocide, Zamzam, they felt, was too soft a target. Its 500,000 residents – predominantly women and children – were virtually defenceless. They were also starving to death.“Inside Zamzam you’d find one of – if notthe– most vulnerable populations on the planet,” says a UN war crimes investigator, requesting anonymity.Even so, soon after 8am heavy artillery jolted Zamzam. Drones buzzed above. The offensive had begun.Zamzam Camp, Sudan9:30amAttacking on multiple fronts, RSF units breached the camp’s defensive berm.UGC footage of fires burning along Zamzam’s main road overlaid on a map of the areaThe attackers’ firepower is apparent as they set fire to neighbourhoods they pass throughNear its southern entrance, up to 50 teenage girls sat staring at their phones. Witnesses saw them being bundled into RSF pickup trucks, and driven away. None have been seen since.Two hundred metres east, 30 RSF pickups entered Ahmadai neighbourhood. Sixty homes belonging to the ethnic Zaghawa tribe were set ablaze. Women were shot as they fled. Six stayed, and burned alive as a consequence.Five minutes north of Ahmadai, Fatima Bakhit was lying beside her husband, two sons and her uncle, who was blind. Through a fence, the pregnant 25-year-old could peer into the courtyard of Zamzam’s last functioning international clinic, run byRelief International.Zamzam Camp, Sudan11amFour RSF Toyota Hiluxes smashed through the gate to the clinic’s compound. Bakhit watched the medics scramble into two foxholes, the subterranean hideaways residents had dug to survive artillery attacks. Five staff squeezed inside one, four into the other.“Come out,falangayat[slaves]!” shouted a fighter. A doctor, injured by shelling, emerged. He was shot in the stomach and tumbled back into the foxhole, wounded but alive. Two more shots. “The others were told to lie on their backs. They were killed,” says Hafiza*, another witness.The occupants of the second foxhole were lined up at gunpoint. They too were executed.Bakhit’s husband was shot dead. More gunfire followed. Her five-year-old son was struck in the back. “Parts of his body fell in my hand,” says Bakhit.Her other son, aged three, crawled towards her, spattered red with the blood of his dead brother. Bakhit was shot in the right leg and hand. “Hey! I told you not to shoot women and children,” yelled an RSF officer.He turned to Bakhit. “Your men arefalangayat.Stand up!” Bakhit’s blind uncle stumbled. He was killed.Zamzam Camp, Sudan11.30amThe RSF entered the Sheikh Farah Quranic school next door to the clinic. It was packed with students and residents seeking shelter. Among them was Sumaya Adam. “We hid, but the attackers dragged the men out.”Bakhit watched at least 15 children and men being led outside. “They got them standing in line and shot them all dead.”The killing spree, by turns methodical and frenzied, would last another 70 hours.Until now, what unfolded at Zamzam has largely remained a mystery: many of those who witnessed the atrocities were killed. However, testimony from scores of survivors along with intelligence and UN sources offers an intricate insight into one of the most shocking episodes of Sudan’sworsening war.View image in fullscreenCrowds seen fleeing the fighting after the attack on Zamzam camp.Photograph: Courtesy of North Darfur Observatory For Human RightsPieced together, the accounts portray an ethnic slaughter of such magnitude that the Zamzam attack is likely to have been the second biggest war crime of Sudan’s catastrophic conflict, behind asimilar massacrein West Darfur nearly two years earlier.Official estimates indicate up to 400 people were killed in Zamzam. A committee set up to investigate the true number has so far identified more than 1,500 deaths. Committee member Mohammed Sharif says the final figure will be significantly higher: hundreds are yet to be accounted for.A Darfur atrocity expert who has interviewed scores of Zamzam survivors is “certain” more than 2,000 died.But the RSF wanted one resident dead more than any other. From the start, paramilitaries identified Hanadi as a priority target. Senior RSF figures were incensed by footage of the young nurse beseeching Zamzam’s residents to stand their ground.An extraordinary plot involving undercover agents, bribes and plain-clothed assassins had been hatched to silence her.“They hate women,” said Manahel, a friend. “Especially ones that stand up to them.”London, UK12.15pmAt about the moment that the staff at Relief International were executed, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) forwarded details of a press briefing about a forthcoming conference.In four days’ time, on 15 April, nearby Lancaster House would host a global summit aimed at bringing peace to Sudan. The date was seared on the Sudanese psyche: thesecond anniversaryof the war between the military and RSF that hadshatteredtheir country.The briefing made no reference to the nightmare evolving in Zamzam. Yet real-time updates were already provoking panic among Sudan’s diaspora.UK officials began receiving “atrocity alerts”. Two days before the Zamzam offensive, sources say the UN security council was briefed that a large-scale assault on the camp was imminent.A month earlier, analysts fromYale Universityhad told the council in person that Zamzam was at risk, one of five face-to-face warnings it shared in 2025.Nathaniel Raymond, at Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab, says: “We made concerted efforts to warn the international community that a full-scale assault on Zamzam was both imminent and inevitable.”A map showing which forces had control of different region of Sudan prior to the attackLess than 24 hours before the attack, sources say FCDO officials were taken aside by concerned experts at an event at the Chatham House research institute in London and told of fears of an impending ethnic massacre at Zamzam.An attack on Sudan’s largest displacement camp was the scenario everybody dreaded. Two decades earlier, it had been conceived as a haven for the ethnic African tribes being slaughtered by Arab militias – the same militias that would become the RSF.Few Darfuri families had avoided the genocidal violence thatkilled up to 300,000. Born the year thegenocidebegan, Hanadi chose nursing because of the suffering she saw as a child.The violence has rarely subsided since. Zamzam expanded with each spasm of fighting. Now 4 miles (7km) long, its proportions did not prevent it being surrounded by the RSF. Besieged since June 2024, food was beyond scarce. Residents were forced to eat leaves to survive. In August that year, famine wasdeclared.“There was a moral obligation for the London conference tobreak the siege,” says a UN source.There was, however, a complication. Among the 20 countries invited to the conference was the UAE, one of the west’s most coveted economic partners.Although the UAE “firmly rejects any claims of providing arms or military equipment” to the RSF, allegations to the contrary arewidely documented. Critics allege it is plausible that weaponry linked to the Gulf state was used at Zamzam. The UAE says the claims are unfounded.Campaigners, though, sensed a unique opportunity. The timing of the assault, on the eve of the London conference, would surely persuade the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to call out the UAE.View image in fullscreenBritain’s foreign secretary, David Lammy (right), and Bankole Adeoye, the African Union’s commissioner for political affairs, peace and security, at the London Sudan Conference.Photograph: Isabel Infantes/PA“Lammy could have used his leverage to tell his Emirati counterpart to cancel the outrageous attack on a displacement camp: ‘If you don’t, you are not invited to London,’” says a UN expert.Such a warning would have had merit. Sources reveal Emirati officials are in “constant contact” with theRSF’s leader, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, among others. Sources, in fact, reveal the UAE had already moved to prevent another massacre.Sources say in June 2024, Abu Dhabi called Hemedti and “told him to stop” a planned assault on El Fasher, after the UN security council introduced aresolutiondemanding the RSF cease fighting around Zamzam and El Fasher, the neighbouring city.No attack happened.Friday, 11 AprilZamzam Camp, SudanIn Sudan, the RSF continued to push deeper into Zamzam. House to house searches were carried out. Occupants were summarily executed. Tayseer Abdalla saw two of her aunts and their young daughters killed inside their home near the central market.Mariam watched the militia enter her sister’s house. “They dragged her out and killed her. They slaughtered us like animals,” she says.Ruqayyah and her family were leaving when the RSF entered their home. Wordlessly, they opened fire. Ruqayyah was able to limp away. Three others were left to die.Vertical video superimposed on satellite image of southern ZamzamThis video was geolocated to southern Zamzam by matching the structure in the background with a satelliteview of the areaMeanwhile, across south Zamzam, RSF fighters offered bribes for clues to Hanadi’s whereabouts. “They were offering huge amounts,” says Ismail Idris, a relative who lives in the British town of Reading.Kaltouma, another camp resident, describes the fighters arriving at her door. “They were shouting: ‘Where is she? Where is she?’”For all the efforts to locate her, Hanadi was often directly in front of them. “She was present on the frontlines, treating, bandaging,” says friend Mohamed Afandy.The casualties mounted. Defended by a ragtag mix of volunteer resistance units andjoint forces– whose remit was to protect civilians – the camp was hopelessly outgunned and outnumbered.About 200 RSF pickups had attacked Zamzam, seven times the number defending it. By midday, the RSF had crossed the B26 highway, entering the main camp.Video overlaid on map shows blurred bodies on the ground with two fighters, one in fatigues the other in plain clothesThis video was geolocated by matching the structure in the background with a satelliteview of the areaA call had gone out for civilians to defend Zamzam. “Hanadi was among the first to answer,” says Muhammad Effendi, a resident.Hanadi headed to the frontline armed with a modest kitchen knife. Up against hi-tech drones and guided bombs, Hanadi’s father, Juma, says her unit repelled at least one attack.By early afternoon, Hanadi’s unit was pinned down near the central market. Witnesses describe the nurse laying down her knife to tend to the wounded.Mohammed Sharif, 27, ran past her position under ferocious fire. “I saw her saving injured people, giving them medicine.”Hope rested with a sizeable Sudanese military garrison seven miles away in El Fasher. If soldiers were sent, Zamzam would be saved.“We were waiting for support from El Fasher but didn’t get it. We still don’t know why,” says Mohamed Adam, a teacher.The central market was not the only place under pressure. Mustafa Bora saw RSF fighters heading for the camp’s community kitchen.Bora sprinted there, imploring everyone to evacuate. Hasanat Musa – seven months pregnant – and her friend, Nana Idris, refused to budge.“Why are you cooking for slaves?” asked fighters as they stormed the kitchen, smashing pots. Musa’s late-stage pregnancy offered no protection. She and Idris were executed.The attackers closed in on Hanadi’s new position: a makeshift health centre north of the market. Hisham Mohamed was fighting alongside her. “She told us: ‘Die with honour. I will be here until the end.’”Hanadi may not have noticed the men approaching. Only when alongside her did they reveal their weapons. She was shot at close range.“Their operatives infiltrated the camp disguised in civilian clothing to carry out her assassination,” says Juma.Chaotic footage shows her being carried by friends to another rudimentary clinic. A soundtrack of gunfire is constant.By now, much of Zamzam was hurrying north. Shells fell on fleeing families. RSF snipers climbed trees, picking them off.Mariam witnessed children flattened by a shell as they fled. “Nobody will ever bury them,” she says.Others described leaping over body parts. Bleeding children lay waiting for help that never came.Hundreds hid underground in cramped, sweltering foxholes. “They were quickly filled with women and children,” says one witness, Adouma Ali.RSF death squads combed the area. Anyone found in a foxhole was shot.Man points at burned out underground ‘foxhole’Residents says the RSF found and killed six civilians hiding in this burned underground ‘foxhole’Further south, Bakhit lay frozen beside her dead husband and child. At 3pm a neighbour attempted to reach her but was shot in the hip.6.30pmDarkness fell. The RSF retreated. “Suddenly it was quiet. People emerged from foxholes, shellshocked,” says Ali. As the cacophony of gunfire subsided, children could be heard crying in the dark.Next, the scraping of shovels as bodies were placed in shallow graves. Bakhit laid her five-year-old son and husband in an enlarged foxhole.In Zamzam’s southern neighbourhoods, the night brought terror. Fighters wandered devastated streets, looking for women to abduct. In Hamaday and Karaba districts, they began raping.Elsewhere, residents headed towards Saloma, Zamzam’s northern neighbourhood. Many passed the makeshift clinic where volunteers were battling to save Hanadi.Back in London, as night fell, the mood among humanitarians was febrile. Attempts to cajole FCDO officials into making a statement on Zamzam ahead of the conference had foundered. “Everybody was raging, asking: ‘Where’s Lammy?’” recalls a prominent human rights expert.They could not even pressure Sudanese diplomats attending the conference: none had been invited.Details of the atrocities, delivered to western policymakers, were politely dismissed.“Evidence of genocide was met with: ‘Thank you for sharing. Keep us updated,’” says a prominent humanitarian.Although the UK is “penholder” on Sudan – meaning it leads the UN security council’s activities on Africa’s third-largest country – nothing happened.Many felt the timing of the offensive before the conference was deliberate. “It was beyond provocative. The RSF – and its alleged backers, the UAE – were saying: “Go on, let’s see what you can do,” says the UN investigator.Saturday, 12 AprilZamzam8amZamzam shuddered again under a ferocious artillery bombardment. One resident counted 250 shells. Tens of thousands of residents began moving towards Saloma.Leaving her home in Jafalo, Nafisa encountered devastation. “I saw 18 dead bodies, including a child killed by shelling.”Drones targeted main roads. At 11am, Bora saw a girl staggering around Labado neighbourhood. Shrapnel had speared her face. She had lost an eye.Qismah, an aid worker, watched adolescent fighters targeting whoever they came across. “They didn’t even try to communicate. They just shot at anyone.”Men in camouflage shooting assault riflesThe RSF attack on Zamzam continued on 12 AprilAcross Zamzam, a huge game of cat and mouse unfolded.Jamal, a health worker, and his family were near the almost desertedMédecins Sans Frontières (MSF) hospitalwhen RSF fighters approached.Jamal ran into a house, joining 50 other people hiding inside alongside a flock of sheep. He peered into the street. Residents were being dragged outside. “I saw them kill six civilians; five young men and someone over 80 years old.”The RSF came closer. More shots reverberated outside. The door swung open.“They entered, saw the sheep, took them and forgot who was in the house. But they were killing anyone, even children. My cousin was killed that way,” says Jamal.Some people headed east, seeking refuge in a nearby valley. Halima and her three children ran there, pursued by RSF pickups. They had no chance.“Before they spoke, they shot my 16-year-old son in the head. I attacked the person who fired, but four men grabbed me: two by the legs, two by the hands. The man who killed my son raped me,” says Halima.Then they raped her teenage daughters. “I could hear their screams, especially my youngest, who was 13. After an hour and a half, [the RSF] left.”Halima laid clothes over her dead son. She carried her youngest daughter, who could not stand, to Saloma.Some crimes were thwarted by women who, inspired by Hanadi, had joined self-defence units. Fatima Ramadan was being pursued by the RSF when self-defence recruits “no older than girls” intervened. “The girls gave us advice and guidance on how to get out.”By mid afternoon, the central market was ablaze. Bleaker news followed: attempts to save Hanadi had proved futile. At about 3pm, the nurse was buried in a secret location to prevent the RSF desecrating her body.Ammunition, fuel and food supplies were perilously low. Joint forces commanders told relatives they were contemplating a full withdrawal.Reports began to surface of children being executed. In one account, RSF had converged on a straw hut in west Zamzam. Several infants were hidden inside. Fighters stood in the doorway and “opened fire on the children”.Nightfall prompted a procession of people to move silently towards Saloma. The joint forces retreated to El Fasher.LondonThe failure of the Sudanese army to help Zamzam hurt. One theory suggests the military sat back and allowed the RSF to rampage, assuming the politicians gathering in London would have little choice but to censure the militia and its Gulf ally.The weekend began with the firm expectation Lammy would issue an early, robust statement on Zamzam. WhatsApp exchanges between atrocity experts and FCDO officials urged the foreign secretary to act.Although officials “acknowledged” the dire situation in Darfur, for the first time humanitarians began to think that they might do nothing about it.“Zamzam obviously framed the conference. Were they deliberately trying to ignore it?” says a source in frequent contact with Lammy’s advisers.As the hours ticked by, and the litany of RSF brutalities grew ever longer, a decision was seemingly made by the UK government to say nothing. No emergency meeting was convened; no face-to-face with groups collating evidence of war crimes from Zamzam.Repeatedly, officials were told they risked ignoring possible genocide. Messages between advisers to the UN security council compared the attack toSrebenica, where more than 8,000Bosniak Muslim men and boys were slaughtered by Bosnian Serb forces in 1995.Did Lammy pressure his Emirati counterpart over Zamzam? Did he even raise Zamzam? The FCDO declined to comment.“Ultimately – by pen and by sword – the RSF was doing its thing in Zamzam while the UAE did its thing in London. Both components were working to keep a genocidal project going,” says a prominent human rights analyst.Tempers flared. “At one point officials felt the burgeoning atrocity wasn’t worth contacting Lammy for,” the analyst claims.The UAE told the Guardian: “We categorically reject any claims of providing any form of support to either warring party since the onset of the civil war.”London3pmAt a time delayed for colleagues in the US, campaigners met online to strategise how to challenge the inertia. Journalists received details of “genocidal” violence.Darkness came with no response from the UK. Similarly, no emergency UN security council meeting had been called.Those monitoring the atrocities in Zamzam from London were consumed with helplessness. “Help! This is hell!” read one WhatsApp message.London7.51pmThen, something: Lammy sent a tweet. “Shocking reports” from Darfur, he wrote, giving impetus to the impending conference. “All sides must commit to the protection of civilians.”Sunday, 13 AprilZamzamSmoke and fire rise from debrisAftermath of the attack on Zamzam campDaybreak saw thousands huddled around Saloma Square, northern Zamzam. Hundreds more squeezed inside the grand mosque for protection.Shortly after 8am, RSF fighters flooded the square. Those sheltering inside the mosque were ordered out. “The RSF began dividing people based on their ethnic groups and physical strength. They started with young men,” says Ibrahim.The men were told to stand in line. It is not known how many were massacred. “A large number were executed by gunfire,” says Ibrahim.Elderly men and women were split into groups. Individuals identified as Zaghawa and linked to the joint forces were, he says, brutally beaten.Community leaders and teachers were humiliated. Unrestrained violence was reserved for another young nurse, called Mihrab. Upon finding surgical gloves in her bag, she was beaten repeatedly for treatingfalanqayat.Women and children, say witnesses, were separated based on physicality; those deemed sufficiently sturdy were forced to walk livestock to Kabkabiya, 105 miles away.Testimony then describes eight shells thumping into Saloma Square. Fighters charged the crowd from east and west.Amid the pandemonium, Bakhit lost her three-year-old. Panicking, she limped south to find him. Bodies littered the landscape.A satellite image shows the extent of burning around the central market.Fire damage seen via satellite on 14 April“Vehicles smelt, bodies were still inside,” says Bakhit. “An RSF commander said: ‘Throw those bodies in thekhor[creek].’”Satellite images confirm widespread destruction. As Zamzam burned, RSF units started shelling El Fasher.An thermal satellite image showing areas that were burned between 10-15 April.Zamzam1pmThe camp was now in full retreat. At 1.45pm theSudanese American Physicians Associationreceived a message from colleagues in Darfur. “Zamzam under the control of the RSF,” it read.Women trapped in the camp became increasingly vulnerable. At least eight were raped that afternoon. Others were abducted. Eleven were reportedly trafficked 19 miles south. Families were asked to pay a ransom equivalent to £6,000 for their release.Back in Saloma, gigantic crowds were hemmed in by the RSF. “Severe shortages of food and water led to the deaths of many children,” says Jamal Abdullah, a teacher.When eventually allowed to leave, more than400,000 peoplefled Zamzam. Tens of thousands walked 30 miles to Tawila. Among them was Hanadi’s family.It was a hellish journey. Women and girls were raped at checkpoints.Men walked away from the road to avoid execution. But the main killer was starvation or thirst. Sources estimate hundreds may have died making the journey.Ethnic prejudices underscored the enmity. Marchers were asked in Zaghawa: “How are you?” Anyone who responded was beaten.Bakhit, unable to find her toddler in Zamzam, joined the throng to Tawila. She felt numb. “I had lost my husband, my children. I felt nothing. Not even hunger.”Multiple accounts, though, detail extraordinary acts of kindness: thousands of children and elderly people were carried by strangers.People with their belongings travel on foot and donkey-led cartsDisplaced people travel towards TawilaThe aftermathBy most metrics the London conference on Sudan flopped, torpedoed by bickering between the Emiratis and opposing Arab states. The concluding conferencestatementignored Darfur’s horror. Zamzam was not even mentioned.“It was like they pretended it never happened,” says a UN source. UK officials say the conference “substantively advanced international coherence” on Sudan.People protest outside Whitehall during conference on SudanPeople protest outside Whitehall during conference on Sudan – video credit: Abdallah AbugardaLammy did not dedicate 15 April to Sudan, finding time to secretly meet his Israeli counterpart. The FCDO would not say for how long, why or where the meeting occurred.“Why wasn’t every diary slot that day devoted to civilian protection in Sudan?” says a diplomat.The conference also sidelined the most important group in Sudan: its women.Hala Al-Karib of theStrategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africasays: “Sudanese women form the backbone of their communities. They smuggle food and medicine, risking their lives. Yet we have no presence in policy and political settings.”View image in fullscreenHala Al-Karib, of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, at a UN security council debate on women, peace and security in 2023. No Sudanese women were invited to the London conference.Photograph: UN photopAbdallah Abugarda, of the UK’s Darfur Diaspora Association, believes Zamzam proves the UK chose the Emirates’ economic muscle over human rights.Of 30,000 Darfuris in his organisation, he says 4,500 know a friend or relative killed in the attack. Leeds-based Suleiman Yousif lost eight family members. “They were murdered together in one location,” he says.On 17 April, as the enormity of the massacre started to become clear, the UN security councilcondemned“repeated attacks” on Zamzam.A week later, Lammyissueda statement, saying the attack carried the “hallmarks of ethnic cleansing”. He has released no official statement on Sudan since then.An FCDO spokesperson, referring to the Zamzam attacks as “abhorrent”, said: “The UK and foreign secretary are at the forefront of efforts to keep the conflict on the international agenda.”Already the slaughter feels like a footnote. An all-party parliamentary meeting on Sudan after the offensive provoked dismay. “None of the speakers mentioned what happened in Zamzam,” says Abugardh.A subsequent request to hold a special session on the attack was, he claims, rejected.Meanwhile, an unpublished UN report on atrocities in Sudan contains, say sources, “half a line reference to what occurred at Zamzam”.Thirty-seven days after Zamzam fell, the UK declared its desire for atrade dealwith the Emirates.Back in Darfur, Hanadi is still celebrated. Her killers, however, will probably never face justice. Her former home stands largely deserted: Hanadi’s family are split between Tawila, Chad and their original North Darfur village.UN investigators believe such “deliberate displacement” was the motive for the attack. Others believe Zamzam was ransacked so the RSF could pay fighters. Residents are adamant the attackers wanted to “exterminate” them.Sporadically, cheering news comes from Darfur. After 18 days trawling Tawila for her toddler, a chance encounter with an injured woman revealed Bakhit’s son was safe, 12 miles away in Shagra. They were reunited in May.But another ethnic slaughter is looming. El Fasher – with a population of over a million – is surrounded, starving and under attack from the RSF.As the fighting intensifies, new heroes like Hanadi will inevitably emerge. They, too, will be buried in secret graves, legends in a war with no end.*To protect them, most eyewitnesses interviewed for this piece have been identified by their first name only or a pseudonymExplore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanConflict and armsInternally displaced peopleWar crimesDavid LammyAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Such a move would open up functionality that allows the app to give detailed directions and show users the best routes to travel.It is a debate spanning nearly two decades which has evolved into a broader test of how democracies balance digital sovereignty with economic openness. Local industry groups are warning of market domination from foreign companies, while those who back Google’s request argue restrictions harm tourism and innovation.Integration classes and complaints offices: South Korea charts a path to a cohesive multicultural futureRead moreSouth Korea is one of only a handful of countries – alongside China and North Korea – in which Google Maps fails to function properly.While Google dominates online services in most of the world, South Korea’s digital landscape is instead controlled by local “portal” companies Naver and Kakao.These platforms provide comprehensive services including search engines, email, news, messaging, music and maps, creating a formidable ecosystem that has long resisted foreign tech dominance. The firms provide precise public mapping data but store it on domestic servers as required by law.Google already licenses the same data from a domestic provider but can use it only to display information like landmarks and local businesses – and, crucially, cannot provide directions for users.Security concerns and local oppositionGoogle says it needs to distribute and process the data through its global server network to provide real-time navigation for billions of users worldwide, including those researching Korean destinations from abroad.The government has consistently refused, citingnational security risks.However, Google argues that the mapping data it seeks has already undergone security review and had sensitive locations removed – and the same data is used by domestic competitors. Google has said it will blur satellite imagery of any sensitive facilities if required by authorities.View image in fullscreenCritics say approving Google’s request could set a precedent for other foreign companies.Photograph: Andrew Merry/Getty ImagesOpposition to Google’s request is fierce. The Korean Association of Spatial Information, Surveying and Mapping (Kasm), which represents 2,600 local companies, reports 90% opposition from 239 member companies surveyed, fearing market domination by the US tech company.“The government must listen to industry concerns,” says Kim Seok-jong, chair of Kasm, warning of potential “industry devastation”.Critics also warn that approving the request could set a precedent for other foreign companies, particularly from China. Apple has also applied for similar permissions, according to local media reports.The government has offered an alternative, saying Google could access the detailed mapping data if it built local datacentres, as domestic competitors do, although this would still not resolve the issue of processing data on Google servers around the world.In 2022, the vulnerability of such an approach came to light when one of Kakao’s datacentrescaught fire, leaving millions without access to the company’s messaging, mapping and ride-hailing services.Tourism impactKorea Tourism Organisation data shows complaints increased 71% last year, with Google Maps accounting for 30% of all app-related grievances, primarily due to the non-functioning directions functionality.Francesco from Italy told the Guardian he was “surprised” to find that Google Maps didn’t work well when he arrived in Seoul for a 1-week trip.“It’s just so annoying. I search for a reviewed restaurant on Google, then I have to switch to Naver Maps (a local app) just for the walking directions,” he said.“I heard it’s a security issue,” said Loic, a tourist from France, “but I feel it’s more about protecting local businesses.”The restrictions have also drawn criticism from tourism startups and tech advocates, who argue that without access to internationally standard mapping tools, they will struggle to build globally competitive services, stifling growth.Previous government reviews in 2007 and 2016 both resulted in rejection.This time, an inter-agency committee including defence and intelligence representatives has already extended its original May deadline, citing the need for deeper consultation with security agencies and industry stakeholders.The issue has featured in broader US-Korea trade tensions, with Washington’s trade office listing South Korea’s mapping restrictions as a “non-tariff trade barrier”.South Korearecently concluded trade negotiationsthat secured 15% tariffs rather than the initially threatened 25%, with President Lee Jae Myung scheduled to meet President Donald Trump at the White House in the coming days or weeks.South Korea’s transport ministry was unavailable for comment ahead of the decision.Google says its Maps software helps people “navigate and explore with confidence using fresh information about places, roads and traffic” and that it works closely with “local governments to make Maps helpful for locals and visitors”.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaGoogleGoogle MapsAlphabetAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Although most of the government mandates, from social distancing to face masks, have been consigned to the past, the virus is still prevalent – and capable of causing real harm.Although it was initially forecast to become a seasonal illness, the virus ison the rise in the US– making it far from the common-cold-style winter illness that was expected.Experts said a lot of predictions made about how Covid-19 would evolve have turned out to be wrong. Five years on, what do we know about the virus?Is Covid on the rise?Although news of a summer wave in the US has led to fears it could be replicated in the UK, the latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that casesdropped by 28%over the past week to reach 1,046. Since most people don’t test any more, this is unlikely to reflect the true prevalence. The data for the past year shows levels have remained consistent, with a large spike last October.Is it a seasonal illness?Experts assumed thatas Covid became endemic, it would change into a winter bug, like the common cold or flu. UKHSA stats show this is not the case. “It is absolutely true that you are as likely to get Covid in summer as in winter,” said Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London.He added: “It’s been a shifting discussion – when do we calm down and say it’s become an endemic coronavirus like the common cold. I think we’re still so far off that place. There’s a kind of optimism that it’s just a winter sniffle, but it’s not a sniffle; it’s quite symptomatic, especially in vulnerable people and in the excess death figures, and also it is absolutely not seasonal.”Altmann said that, although there is a perception that, as a coronavirus, Covid-19 is akin to a common cold, in reality it is closer to the flu in terms of the death rate, its impact on the NHS and the potential severity of symptoms.Simon Williams, a sociologist at Swansea University who has researched public views on the pandemic, said: “We’re getting to the point where there’s a legitimate question about whether it will ever be [a winter virus]. It’s not a typical respiratory virus in terms of seasonality.”Adam Kucharski, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that because Covid-19 evolves quickly – twice as fast as the fastest flu – it is less constrained by season. “Whereas a small change in transmissibility conditions is enough to stop flu in summer, Sars-CoV-2 can basically evolve its way over this barrier,” he said.Which variant are we on now?The main Covid viruses in circulation are the Omicron subvariants. These are “obviously milder than Wuhan or Delta”, Altmann said, adding it’s not the case that they are becoming progressively milder, but rather population immunity is higher owing to vaccines and prior infections.The newest variant, NB.1.8.1, has been detected in the UK and international data suggests it is growing as a proportion of all Covid cases. World Health Organization analysis found the new strain is more contagious, but vaccination gives significant protection.Williams said we can expect to keep seeing the virus evolve, similar to how there are new flu virus combinations each year.View image in fullscreenThe volume of vaccines given early in the pandemic gave wide hybrid immunity, but this could reduce as hesitancy grows.Photograph: Michele Tantussi/ReutersShould we all get vaccines?The experts agreed the main problem is the low take-up of the free vaccine, which isavailable to people at greatest risk from Covid infection, including those aged 75 and over and those who are immunocompromised.Altmann said anyone who could afford it may wish to pay for the vaccine – not least because he hears regularly from new long Covid sufferers: “Who wouldn’t feel safer with boosted neutralising antibodies and T-cells?”He noted there is a spectrum of suffering, with people who are infected occasionally and mildly or non-symptomatically on one end, and on the other, those living with long Covid. There is also a third, under-researched, group in the middle of young or middle-aged people who get four to six reinfections each year, and may have to take several days off work each time. “It’s non-trivial and makes it quite hard to do your work,” he said.‘We’re losing decades of our life to this illness’: long Covid patients on the fear of being forgottenRead moreAlthough there is still hybrid immunity in the population because most people received several vaccines during the pandemic, there is a growing population of children who would have been too young to have received them at the time.The experts feared that growing vaccine hesitancy, which Williams described as “one of the most pressing concerns” in public health, could have an impact on whether these children receive a jab or people turn up for their boosters.Another consideration, when it comes to building immunity, is the growing body of research suggesting that for several months after a Covid infection, people become more vulnerable to other infections and there can be lingering effects on the heart, cardiovascular system and the brain.“We’re only five years into this virus, there’s a lot of question marks and unknowns,” said Williams.Explore more on these topicsCoronavirusInfectious diseasesVaccines and immunisationnewsShareReuse this content"

What’s at stake and why are the proposals so contentious?What is China proposing?If the building goes ahead it would be the biggest embassy in Europe, in the heart of the city and near the Tower of London. The 20,000 sq metre (5 acre) site, which was once home to the Royal Mint, was bought by China for £225m in 2018. Beijing commissioned David Chipperfield, one of Britain’s most respected architects, to design the new embassy and cultural centre for the site.Why is it controversial?Dissidents fear it will be used as a centre to spy on, harass and possibly detain opponents of the Chinese government. They point to how in 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester wasdragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate and then beaten. Local residents are concerned the new embassy will be a magnet for protests and a potential security risk. China hawks and some of Britain’s allies, notably the US, warn that it also poses an espionage risk because of its close proximity to London’s financial district. In June the White House voiced “deep concern” about the new embassy and noted its closeness to the London office ofseveral US banks.Is it a security risk?The Home Office and Foreign Office have asked for the construction of a “hard perimeter” around the site to address public and safety concerns. The site used to house trading floors that were wired up to other financial institutions. It is also close to the City’s telephone exchange. Allowing China to build on the site would be an invitation to espionage, according to the Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith. The Metropolitan police have warned the building would attract protests that wouldimpede traffic and require extra policing.What is the history of the planning application?China’s initial planning application was rejected by the local Tower Hamlets council in 2022 over safety and security concerns and fears about the impact on tourism. In August 2024, just after Labour came to power, China resubmitted the same application. The application came up in Keir Starmer’s first phone call with China’s president, Xi Jinping, that same month. In October the housing secretary, Angela Rayner, who has responsibility for planning matters, “called in” the application, moving it from local to central government to decide on its merits.What stage is it at now?A decision on the application is due by 9 September. As part of the process Rayner has asked China to un-redact parts of the plans that had been “greyed out” in the application. The redacted plans submitted include a basement area with rooms of no identifiable use. In a letter to the Chinese embassy, Rayner pointed to the principle that the public should know what is being proposed before planning permission is granted. She also asked for more details on how the embassy planned to address safety concerns. This would require a further consultation, which could delay the final decision.What is at stake?Legally, only planning considerations should influence Rayner’s decision. In reality, she has a difficult political and diplomatic balancing act to perform. On one hand, there are concerns about China’s record on human rights and its potential threat to national and financial security. On the other, the UK is keen to pursue closer ties with China – not least to encourage Chinese investment in the UK’s faltering economy.What does China say?So far, the Chinese embassy, currently based in London’s Portland Place where it has been since the 1870s, has said it has no plans to alter the designs for its new HQ. In a statement tothe BBC, it said it was “committed to promoting understanding and the friendship between the Chinese and British peoples and the development of mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Building the new embassy would help us better perform such responsibilities”. On objections to the plans it said: “Anti-China forces are using security risks as an excuse to interfere with the British government’s consideration over this planning application. This is a despicable move that is unpopular and will not succeed.” While the fate of China’s London embassy is being decided,China has blocked a UK request to rebuild its embassy in Beijing.Explore more on these topicsLondonChinaSurveillanceAngela RaynerPlanning policyEnglandexplainersShareReuse this content"

How did it cope with my Yorkshire accent?Leeds MP Mark Sewards has launched a digital assistant, but the results of my chat show MPs’ aides have nowt to worry aboutRobyn VinterNorth of England correspondentThu 7 Aug 2025 15.55 EDTFirst published on Thu 7 Aug 2025 14.03 EDTShareAs anyone with even a trace of a regional dialect who has had to pay a parking fine can attest, voice recognition services struggle with accents. Now, people in Mark Sewards’ constituency inLeedsare likely to find the same problem with his AI variant.A chatbot billed as the first AI version of an MP responds in Sewards’ voice with advice, support or by offering to pass on a message to his team – but only if it understands you.The website, a virtual representation of the MP for Leeds South West and Morley – complete with a Pixar-style cartoon – was launched by a local startup to field questions from his constituents, some of whom have broad Leeds accents.I was interested to see how “Sewardsbot” would handle a conversation with someone from only a couple of miles away from his constituency border.Summoning my “home” voice (the one I had before it was adulterated by university, several years living in London, and many conversations with Guardian colleagues from East Sussex), I begin a conversation.“Hi. I’m AI Mark Sewards,LabourMP for Leeds South West and Morley, can I help you today?” the character says, in Sewards’ voice.“Now then,” I begin. My words appear on the screen, and while the bot doesn’t seem to understand it as a greeting – “now then” means “hello” in most of Yorkshire – it fills the gap in the conversation, asking for my name and contact details.The AI version of Seward records all the conversations, with the aim that his team will be able to pick out the key topics that his constituents are talking about – something it has been criticised for.Speaking of key topics, I go straight in with what is on many people’s minds: the horrendous images and video coming out of Palestine. “Are you gonna do summat about Gaza? Y’ant got it right Mark, love,” I say.Sewardsbot handles this well, understanding that I’m broadly talking about Gaza, though doing nothing to explain the government’s position.A message on the website had warned me: “AI Mark is a prototype digital assistant – this is a work in progress and not everything it says should be taken as fact. All responses are AI-generated.”I try a few other phrases to see if I can throw it off with colloquialisms, asking if someone can call me, but that I’m at work “nine while half five so I can’t be ont’ phone” until after, and telling it I was “chuffed” to have had a chip butty in a nice breadcake in his constituency.Its interpretation of my accent is terrible and much of it is transcribed as unreadable gobbledegook. Unlike a human, it doesn’t understand that the glottal stop used in front of words means “the”, although it manages to get the gist.So I decide to ask the kind of problem a constituency MP might be requested to solve – even if it’s not their responsibility. “Me neighbour’s lad’s blocked’t ginnel at’t back wi an old settee and he won’t do owt about it. If someone dun’t come for it, it’s going in’t road,” I say.I suspect Sewards himself would tell me to contact Leeds city council about flytipping, instead the AI tells me I need to speak to the police to report an abandoned vehicle.MPs’ aides will no doubt be sighing in relief – they’ve got nowt to worry about just yet.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)LeedsLabourLocal politicsLinguisticsComputingLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

That serves as a suitably contemplative introduction to Shakespeare’s death-fixated play, one that begins after the poisoning of one Hamlet and ends with the slaughter of another.Wrocław’s Song of the Goat gravitates naturally to such material. This least frivolous of companies made its name on the fringe in 2004 withChronicles: A Lamentation, an expressive dance-theatre piece shot through with haunting polyphonic song that felt placeless and timeless.The company is in full voice here in Grzegorz Bral’s response to Shakespeare’s play, the music more recognisably of a western operatic tradition, but no less rich and resonant. Gorgeous though the singing is, with its waves of tightly drilled choral sound sometimes accompanied by the bowed string instrument known as anyckelharpa, the production seems uninterested in saying anything fresh aboutHamlet.View image in fullscreenGothic ferocity … Hamlet: Wakefulness.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianPacked into an hour, it is set on the night of the old king’s murder and features the familiar characters – a resolute Claudius, an obstinate Ophelia and an angry Gertrude, as well as an indignant Hamlet – but makes no attempt to explore them in depth. There is a smattering of speeches, heavily accented and hard to make sense of, and a couple of anachronistic additions (“The end justifies the means,” says Claudius; “Quiet bitch,” says old Hamlet for no apparent reason), but only the sketchiest sense of a narrative arc.And that is a problem because when emotion is detached from action, it comes across as histrionic. The mood is sombre, fraught and intense, but to what ends? It leaves the characters looking two-dimensional and crudely old-fashioned. A primarily sung piece, Hamlet – Wakefulness scores highly on gothic ferocity, less so on dramatic purpose.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 15 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalHamletSummerhallreviewsShareReuse this content"

Heroism! Paranoia! The dangerous romance of survivalist storiesAuthors have been imagining societal collapse for decades – but could the reality be as dreadful as they think?Dorian LynskeyThu 7 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 12.11 EDTShareThe man who claimed to have coined the word “survivalist” called himself Kurt Saxon. The sinister godfather of survivalism was actually born Donald Eugene Sisco, a former journalist who spent the 1960s floating between far-right groups in California before deciding that none of them were serious enough. Sisco’s passion formaking his own bombs, which he advocated using on student demonstrators, cost him the fingers of his left hand. He liked to say that he was the reincarnation of a soul whose previous lives included a Roman legionary, a Nazi stormtrooper and the revolutionary philosopher Thomas Paine.Survivalism, or prepping, is experiencing a boom, from Silicon Valley billionaires to users ofthe Reddit board r/collapse. Elon Musk’s entire career, for example, has been partly driven byapocalypse anxietiesand his conviction that he alone can save the human race (details to be confirmed). The scenarios vary – climate catastrophe, renegade AI, another pandemic, nuclear war between authoritarian regimes – as do the responses. Some claim to be making rational preparations to survive in the event of civilisational collapse, while others seem unnervingly keen to see the world turned upside down. This can feel like a very 21st-century obsession, stoked by online conspiracy theories and the doomerism produced by 24/7 news, but Sisco was pioneering the doom business 50 years ago.During the 1970s, rising crime and soaring inflation convinced Sisco that America was headed for an almighty crash and that he had better be ready for it. In 1976, he launched a magazine called the Survivor, which offered subscribers an unnerving combination of tips on self-sufficiency (how to make candles, blow glass, grow cucumbers) and ghoulish predictions of a cataclysmic event known as Collapse Day. “America’s irreversible collapse should be apparent to anyone by 1980,” Sisco wrote in the first issue. In an interview, Sisco summed up the survivalist’s blend of excitement and genocidal misanthropy: “I’m quite thrilled by the prospect of civilization ending. It is an adventure and a great culling that has to come.”Survivalism is a way to accomplish the creative renarration of the selfRichard G Mitchell Jr, sociologistYet despite Sisco’s claims, the word “survivalist” actually originated in fiction – specifically Giles Tippette’s 1975 novel The Survivalist. It is the story of Franklin Horn, a middle-aged man with similar, though less fascistic premonitions of doom to Sisco. Horn believes that the city he lives in is on the verge of collapse and tries to convince his wife and friends to join him in building a fortress in the Ozarks (where Sisco would move in 1980). “I’m not a humanist,” Horn says. “I’m a survivalist.” When they decline to sign up to his paranoia, he goes it alone and finds himself stalked by an antagonist who raids his supplies and tries to kill him. In fighting back, Horn realises that man cannot live alone in fear and shamefacedly rejoins the civilisation he rejected. Tippette repudiated in advance Sisco’s lurid fantasies of apocalyptic adventure.Novelists have been imagining the challenges of survival for decades. If survivalism can be seen as a form of storytelling that consumes the storyteller, then fiction can help us understand the mentality and the dangerous places it can lead.From Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe in 1719 to Ridley Scott’s movieThe Martianalmost 300 years later, audiences have been captivated by tales of resourceful individuals who find increasingly ingenious ways to survive a hostile environment until they can return to civilisation. They are adventure stories in which heroism consists of relentless problem-solving rather than conflict.The difference between a survivor and a survivalist is that one is a temporary condition and the other a permanent identity. The survivalist actively wants to be estranged from civilisation – craves, in fact, the destruction of civilisation itself. After all, it would be a waste of effort if society refused to collapse. In the 1970s, some called themselves “retreaters”, having in effect resigned from society. Though framed as an ugly necessity (people would try to steal your stuff), violence was part of the appeal of this bare-knuckle libertarianism. The survivalist is not content with maintaining a vegetable patch and whittling a bow and arrow to hunt for food. He wants guns, and people to use them on.The survivor and the survivalist go head-to-head in William Golding’s 1954 novel Lord of the Flies, about a group of schoolboys stranded on an island during a nuclear war. Their initial leader, Ralph, wants to preserve a skeleton of social norms and solidarity until help arrives. The fire he maintains is both a signal to rescuers and a symbol of civilised values: “The rules are the only thing we’ve got!” His challenger, Jack, however, turns himself into a tribal chieftain, exerting power through violence, barbarism and superstition. For him, catastrophe is liberation. Why would he ever want to go home again?View image in fullscreenPeter Brook’s 1963 film adaptation of Lord of the Flies.Photograph: RGR Collection/AlamySubsequent catastrophe novels such as John Christopher’s The Death of Grass (1956) and Charles Eric Maine’s The Tide Went Out (1958) proposed that most people thought of themselves as noble Ralphs but would soon turn into brutal Jacks once the going got tough.The fictional survivalist who first expressed the ominous politics of survivalism appeared in HG Wells’s 1890s phenomenon The War of the Worlds. Amid the chaos of a Martian invasion, the narrator meets an artilleryman with a plan: humanity will regroup and rebuild in underground sewers and tunnels in order to wage guerrilla war against the invaders. The artilleryman is drooling with anticipation because he is a eugenicist and – 20 years before the fact – a fascist. He contrasts “able-bodied, clean-minded men” with the “weak and silly” who deserve to die: “It’s a sort of disloyalty, after all, to live and taint the race.” Decades later, in a 1982 interview with the Sacramento Bee, Sisco argued that anyone with an IQ below 110 should be sterilised to save America from degeneracy.Survivalism went mainstream during the first half of the 1980s. Newspapers profiled survival businesses and the isolated communities they served, finding characters much like the artilleryman. Their lurid fears included nuclear war, foreign invasion, environmental disasters, race war and food shortages due to overpopulation.The sociologist Richard G Mitchell Jr spent more than a decade talking to survivalists for his 2002 book Dancing at Armageddon: Survivalism and Chaos in Modern Times. He found that most of them felt impotent and overwhelmed in their day-to-day lives and were empowered by imagining themselves the main characters in a greatly simplified world without rule of law – or WROL in survivalist parlance. “Survivalism,” Mitchell observed, “is a way to accomplish the creative renarration of the self and often one’s companions into tales of aesthetic consequence.” It gave their lives meaning.It was in 1981 that Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior popularised the hitherto obscure word “post-apocalyptic”. “Mad” Max Rockatansky is not technically a survivalist, because he never expected or wanted society to collapse. A former police officer, he sides with the vulnerable neomedieval community rather than the feral biker gang. But the movie inspired a more aggressively rightwing genre that the writer Mike Davis called “armageddonist”.View image in fullscreenMad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981), directed by George Miller.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/Rex FeatThat same year, Jerry Ahern began publishing The Survivalist, a series of pulp novels about John Rourke, a former CIA officer who battles Soviet invaders, mutants and cannibals in the aftermath of a nuclear war. Ahern published as many as four volumes a year (titles included The Doomsayer, The End Is Coming and The Savage Horde), which tells you something about their quality. More notable for the loving attention Ahern gives to various firearms (he later founded his own gun company) than for their characters or ideas, they sold millions of copies.At the same time, survivalism merged with the far-right militia movement to produce hundreds of real-life John Rourkes. The far-right, anti-government militia group the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord conducted an End Time Overcomer Survival Training School – and practised assassination skills on its 224-acre (91-hectare) armed compound in Arkansas – before one member killed a Black police officer and attracted the attention of the FBI.‘All of his guns will do nothing for him’: lefty preppers are taking a different approach to doomsdayRead moreA related white nationalist group, the Order, murdered the Jewish radio host Alan Berg and was also shut down by the FBI – a story told recently in Amazon Prime’s The Order. All of this overt Nazism and homicidal violence made survivalism a dirty word, leading Sisco to insist that real survivalists do not shoot police officers. “A survivalist is simply one who anticipates the collapse of civilisation and prepares to survive it,” he protested.One peculiar product of this fraught period was The Survivors, a flop 1983 comedy starring Robin Williams as a paranoid dental supply executive who joins a survivalist camp in Vermont. A more serious one was David Brin’s 1985 novel The Postman. Brin’s hero, Gordon Krantz, dons a dead postman’s uniform and delivers his abandoned mail to bring a little hope and order to post-apocalyptic Oregon. His foes are a “loose, macho, hyper-survivalist” militia called the Holnists, whose antisocial savagery he blames for America’s desperate state: “It was the same solipsistic philosophy of ego that had stoked the rage of Nazism.”Brin was rebuking the violent, self-aggrandising survivalism that ran through post-Mad Max fiction and spilled over into real life via the Covenant and the Order. In The Postman, society is something priceless that should be mourned and rebuilt, not a sandcastle to knock down.After the militia movement was associated with atrocities such as the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, survivalism’s reputation sank further. But in 1998, one user of an internet message board about the Y2K bug introduced the synonym “prepper”. It sounded more modern and more reasonable than “survivalist”, with an emphasis on the practical details of preparation rather than daydreams of post-apocalyptic gunplay. The National Geographic series Doomsday Preppers, which launched in 2012, became the channel’s most watched show to date.View image in fullscreenThe Doomsday Preppers discussion panel during the National Geographic portion of the 2012 Summer Television Critics Association tour in Los Angeles, California, on 3 August 2012.Photograph: Frederick M Brown/Getty ImagesDespite the rebranding, preppers are still usually treated as sinister or absurd in 21st-century fiction. Closer in spirit to Tippette’s The Survivalist than Ahern’s The Survivalist, these stories puncture what Brin called “little-boy wish fantasies about running amok in a world without rules”.Cormac McCarthy’s crushingly bleak 2006 masterpiece The Road is often praised on prepper websites but it presents survival as a gruelling slog rather than an adventure. “There were few nights lying in the dark that he did not envy the dead,” McCarthy writes of his unnamed protagonist. The most acclaimed episode of HBO’sThe Last of Usmeanwhile features a misanthropic survivalist (played by Nick Offerman) who admits: “I used to hate the world and I was happy when everyone died.” But his hard shell is cracked open when he falls in love with an unexpected visitor and is reminded that people matter after all.View image in fullscreenNick Offerman in The Last of Us (2023).Photograph: HBOWhile Offerman’s character represents the old-fashioned hermit survivalist, other stories satirise the new billionaire preppers: people like Peter Thiel, who spend vast amounts of money on luxury bunkers, private islands or refuges in New Zealand. While traditional survivalism is a power fantasy for the powerless, this version is an escape route for elites who are partly responsible for the social and environmental instability that terrifies them. “Why do people who are envied for being so powerful appear to be so afraid?” asked the economist Robert A Johnsoninthe New Yorker. “What does that really tell us about our system?” They are retreaters.The popular suspicion of the survival industry dates back to the fallout shelter craze of the early 1960s, when The Twilight Zone showed neighbour turning on neighbour in The Shelter; Stanley Kubrick’sDr Strangeloveranted about creating a postwar master race in the mineshafts; and Bob Dylan mocked bunker dwellers in his song Let Me Die in My Footsteps. The shelter business all but collapsed within a year when most Americans decided that not only would they probably not survive a nuclear war but that they would not want to.Subterranean shelters are ripe for parody once more. The recent satirical TV seriesFallout, based on the hit video game, contrasts the suffocating conformism of the Vaults with the perilous freedom of the wasteland. In American Horror Story: Apocalypse, a billionaire socialite and her entourage shelter from a nuclear winter in the luxurious bunker Outpost 3 but the situation turns nightmarish as food supplies run out and paranoia flourishes.In season three of the post-apocalyptic sitcom The Last Man on Earth another socialite hides out from a pandemic in her dead friend’s well-appointed bunker and slowly loses her mind. Whether it is the menace of desperate companions, a sinister regime or maddening solitude, an apparent refuge becomes a prison to be escaped.The individual, the isolated self was dead. The social self was regnantA survivor of the 1906 San Francisco earthquakeWe sympathise with Robinson Crusoe or Matt Damon’s character in The Martian because they have been forcibly estranged from the human race and are desperate to reconnect. But from the Ozarks compound to the New Zealand bunker, survivalistschooseto sever themselves from humanity at large. No wonder we enjoy seeing them fail.All stories of catastrophe and survival contain a verdict on human nature. Most texts about survivalism, from prepper handbooks to The Road, promote a Hobbesian view of humanity: civilisation is a thin skin stretched over an abyss of animal brutality. “Men have always had urges towards dominance which are basically stronger than urges towards cooperation,” John Christopher said when asked about the pessimism in The Death of Grass.But is this true, or does survival fiction encourage us to believe the worst? While nobody knows what would happen if everything collapsed, Rebecca Solnit demonstrates in A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities that Arise in Disaster that in the aftermath of real catastrophes the looters and marauders are vastly outnumbered by people trying to help and save each other. Far from being a liberal delusion, mutual aid is a powerful human instinct. “Everybody was your friend and you in turn everybody’s friend,” recalled one survivor of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. “The individual, the isolated self was dead. The social self was regnant.”Whether for political reasons or simply the need for narrative excitement, conventional survival fiction endorses the idea, as David Brin put it, “that humanity in general is dreadful and therefore only individual heroes matter”. But in novels such as Pat Frank’s Alas, Babylon (1959) or Emily St John Mandel’s Station Eleven (2014), post-apocalyptic survival is achieved instead by solidarity and collaboration. Problem-solving is a collective endeavour and selfishness spells doom. These stories are worth telling, too, and they may be closer to reality.Dorian Lynskey is the author ofEverything Must Go: The Stories We Tell About the End of the WorldExplore more on these topicsBooksThe Armageddon complexTelevisionThe MartianThe Last of UsFalloutDr StrangelovefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some can even heat your soup for tuppence (and we’ve tested them all to make sure that they’re energy-efficient). However, the difference in functions, versatility and maintenance can be startling. I put nine blenders from some of the most well-known manufacturers through their paces to separate the smooth operators from the far-from-brilliant buys.At a glanceBest blender overall:Braun PowerBlend 9 jug blender JB9040BK£149 at AmazonBest budget blender:Kenwood Blend-X Fresh blender BLP41.A0GO£66.99 at KenwoodBest stick blender:KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender£186.15 at KitchenAidBest investment blender:Vitamix Explorian E520£497.94 at TescoWhy you should trust meI’ve spent decades testing appliances: my kitchen has hosted hundreds of them. So, unsurprisingly, I know what I like in a blender. For a start, I’m looking for frighteningly sharp blades. All the parts that come into contact with food should be simple to hand-wash or put in the dishwasher because I have minimal patience for cleaning. My ideal blender should be able to tackle frozen chunks of fruit or veg (for when I haven’t had time to shop for fresh) and be easy to scrape out or, in the case of personal blenders, be easy to drink from.How I testedView image in fullscreenThe right mix: nine blenders were put to the test.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianI’m something of a smoothie convert. I’ve been on the green stuff daily ever since I tested my first blender. For me, the average smoothie consists of whatever fruit I have, spinach, a dash of ginger and flaxseed (I’ve tried broccoli, but even the smallest floret makes the smoothie taste funky). Sometimes, when I feel like living dangerously, I throw in a dollop of yoghurt.To test the blenders, I made my usual drink, substituting fresh spinach for frozen to test the sharpness of the blades, and adding apple to detect fruit skin, orange for any remaining pith, kiwi for its many seeds and banana. I used whole flaxseed to assess the ability to grind and turmeric to assess the potential risk of staining, plus enough water to fill the containers at least halfway. All while Googling whether you can overdose on vitamin C (answer: you can, but it’s hard) because I’m fairly certain you’re not meant to drink smoothies in pints.Each blender was tested on its ability to turn chunky soup into smooth, taking on a mix of cooked veg, including red pepper, beans and pasta. For those that heated soup, this was done from chilled, and the resulting temperature was taken at the end of the cycle. A power meter measured the running cost of each on the highest setting for a minute, using the current price cap of 25.73p a kWh. I tested nine blenders. The blenders sourced for this article were either returned to their sources or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best blenders in 2025 in the UKView image in fullscreen‘Excelled at blending soup’: the KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender.Photograph: Rachel Ogden/The GuardianBest blender overall:Braun PowerBlend 9 jug blender JB9040BKView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£199 at John Lewis£149 at AmazonIf you’d told me a blender that cost less than £200 would impress me most during testing, I might have choked on my smoothie. Yet, the PowerBlend 9 did just that. It has a great mix of programs, including a cleaning setting that was good at flushing out debris from around the blades, and a smoothie program that gave a choice of different textures.Why we love itThe PowerBlend 9 excels in most areas. It has a large enough jug to be useful when whipping up soup for a family, a count-up/down timer and enough auto settings for keen cooks. The performance was excellent when making smoothies: in less than a minute, all traces of the spinach were gone and the drink was free of seeds, skin or lumps. It comes with a tamper so you can make frozen desserts easily, too.As well as blitzing soup, the blender heats it using the friction of the blades. In just five minutes and 45 seconds, I heated it to 94C (if anything, this is slightly too hot, but it would cool down rapidly if poured into a cold bowl). This used 0.106kWh, costing about 3p.Unlike when testing the other blenders, my power meter detected that the PowerBlend 9 was drawing a small amount of electricity when the screen was on but the blender wasn’t in use. Always remember to turn it off at the switch. Only some parts are dishwasher safe: the lid, measuring cap and detachable blades. But the Clean program, plus a quick rinse afterwards, helps keep the jug clean.It’s a shame that …it emits an ear-splitting whine on the highest settings that can clear a room of people in seconds.Running costan hour on maximum:25p (0.412p/minute = 0.96kWh)Maximum capacity:3l (working capacity 2l)Auto functions:smoothie, soup, chop, ice crush, frozen dessert, spread, cleanDishwasher safe:lid, measuring cap and detachable blades only (but no mention of this in instructions, yet online listing says yes)Spare parts:available at4 Braun HouseholdBest budget blender:Kenwood Blend-X Fresh blender BLP41.A0GOView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£66.99 at Currys£66.99 at KenwoodWhile this may not be the best blender you can buy, the Blend-X Fresh is excellent value for money. It has three speeds, as well as a pulse setting, and a dedicated ice-crush button. The jug has a good family-size capacity, and the running costs are low.Why we love itThe Blend-X Fresh is surprisingly easy to keep clean for a budget model – so much so that it’s the main reason it made our selection. Its blades unscrew, so you can make sure there’s no food residue hiding underneath them. They’re easily reattached, screwing in the opposite direction to which you twist the jug into the base, meaning you won’t accidentally leave them behind after blending. The jug is also quite light, so it’s not too heavy to carry around even when it’s full.Its performance was solid during testing: after a minute’s blending, most seeds vanished into the smoothie. While there were slight flecks of fruit skin, all the frozen spinach was incorporated. The soup was blended in only 30 seconds and was beautifully smooth, with just a little remaining pepper skin that had escaped the blades. It was quite noisy on the higher speeds.It’s a shame that …its lid feels flimsier than the rest; used regularly, this is probably the part you’ll end up replacing.Running costan hour on maximum:8p (0.129p/minute = 0.3kWh)Maximum capacity:2l (working capacity 1.5l)Auto functions:noneDishwasher safe:yes, but blades detach to be cleaned by handSpare parts:available at4 KenwoodThe best air fryers, tried and tested for crisp and crunchRead moreBest stick blender:KitchenAid Go cordless hand blender plus accessories with batteryView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£186.15 at KitchenAid£148.95 without battery at Harts of SturIt’s expensive for a stick blender, but KitchenAid’s Go justifies the price tag by being seriously versatile. Cordless – so there’s no need to be tied to a socket when blending – and immersible, it’s ideal for blitzing soup that’s still in the pot (a pan guard ensures it won’t scratch the base), as well as multiple other processing tasks. If you already have the compatible battery, you can subtract more than £30 from the price.Why we love itThis one made the list for its flexibility and ease of storage. It can not only be used anywhere in your kitchen but also whisks, chops and mixes as well as blends. I was impressed that it could tackle frozen and fresh ingredients, as hand blenders rarely have the power to do so. The smoothie had a little residue remaining, with the kiwi seeds mostly escaping the blades, and it was frothier than I like, but overall, the performance was good for a stick blender. It excelled at blending soup: no lumps or pepper skin remained, and it took only about 15 seconds to puree it.There are a couple of downsides. There’s only one speed – meaning it can be tricky to control consistency at first – and having the battery on top makes it weighty: not something you’d want to hold upright for a long time.It’s a shame that …it’s awkward to depress two buttons at once – the unlock and power buttons – so it takes some getting used to.Running costan hour on maximum:cordless, so unavailable (three-hour recharge estimated to be just under 2p)Maximum capacity:1l (supplied jug)Auto functions:noneDishwasher safe:yes, most parts (blender arm is hand-wash only)Spare parts:extra and spare parts are available atKitchenAid online(contact the company directly for smaller parts), and it can arrange repairsBest investment blender:Vitamix Explorian E520View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Rachel Ogden/The Guardian£497.94 at Tesco£497.95 at Harts of SturThere’s no getting away from it, Vitamix blenders are pricey. The Explorian E520 I reviewed is the most expensive blender in this roundup – but the brand’s machines offer a lot in return. The E520, for example, has 10 speeds, a pulse and three settings that will heat soup and deliver silky-smooth smoothies. Its seven-year warranty adds confidence that this blender will keep performing efficiently.Why we love itThe Explorian E520 is made for smoothies: its dedicated setting resulted in the best smoothie overall, starting at a slow speed before ramping up to a noisy whirl. In 50 seconds it created a flawlessly smooth drink – no lumps, no skin, no seeds. It also performed excellently when heating and blending soup using the dedicated setting. This lasted for five minutes and 49 seconds – using 0.094kWh, which would cost about 2p, the same cost as the Braun reviewed above. Unlike the Braun blender, though, the resulting soup was a little cooler, at 82C from chilled, so you won’t have to wait too long for it to be a suitable consumption temperature.It’s a shame that …buying the Explorian E520 will dent your small appliance budget. But just think of all the money you’ll save on frozen yoghurt.Running costan hour on maximum:22p (0.360p/minute = 0.84kWh)Maximum capacity: 2lAuto functions:smoothie, frozen dessert, hot soupDishwasher safe:yes, all parts, but can also run self clean on the baseSpare parts:compatible lids are available as spare parts, as are extra jugs with lids, plus repairs are available via authorised centres.

It can be cleaned in the dishwasher – although hand-washing is recommended – and it performs reasonably well.In testing, the smoothie it made wasn’t entirely smooth after a minute of blending, but it did well with cooled soup: 30 seconds on the top speed was enough for a fairly consistent result.It didn’t make the final cut because …it has a heavy glass jug and isn’t suitable for hot liquid blending.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

A two-hour charge is enough for eight smoothies, so you can go more than a week without thinking about a socket, and it’ll switch off automatically after blending for a minute.However, unlike the KitchenAid Go blender I tested, this cordless design lacks power: the smoothie still had fruit residue and kiwi seeds, and the soup was smooth but had visible herbs after a minute’s blitz.It didn’t make the final cut because …its cup is fairly large for a personal blender, but the maximum fill line is low, so you’ll only be able to blitz a smaller amount of liquid at a time– it’s on the small side for a standard smoothie.

It’s an on-the-go blender rather than a kitchen workhorse, offering 30-second bursts of shake and smoothie making for a pre- or post-workout boost. That does mean its capacity is fairly limited – about 450ml max – but there’s enough power to tackle frozen lumps.The smoothie I made had some fruit skin and seeds left behind, but all traces of the frozen spinach had gone. It was less suitable for soup: a minute of blending worked through all the lumps, but there was more texture than with other blenders, and the cup size was limiting.

This means that finding the blender that’s best for you depends on what you’re most likely to use it for and how often.Blenders vs food processorsIf you have room for only one appliance on your worktop, and it’s between afood processorand a blender, think about the tasks you’ll need it to tackle.Food processors are geared towardschopping, slicing, mixing and whipping, as well as processing dry food, such as bread into breadcrumbs, whereas blenders are better for liquids, including batters, drinks, smoothies and soups.There may be some crossover: food processors with blender attachments, or blenders with a chopping container. However, these can lack power or not possess the same versatility as a dedicated appliance (for example, there may be only one speed on a blender attachment).What type of blender do you need?Blenders usually fit into one of three categories:Jug-style blendersare good for keen cooks and those who batch cook or make smoothie bowls, milkshakes or smoothies for a family or crowd. A full-sized jug blender is ideal for whipping up sauces, pancake batter, soups, nut butter, non-dairy milk, ice-cream, cocktails or mocktails and desserts.Personal blendersare usually smaller, with on-the-go cups. They’re best for smoothies and other drinks, with enough capacity for one or two people. Smaller households may be able to use one for most everyday blending. Most aren’t suitable for hot liquids, and they tend not to have enough capacity to blend a batch of soup.Stick blendersare best for blending directly in apan, bowl or jug without having to transfer the contents into a full-sized blender. They’re great for speedy blending of soups, stews and desserts, but less suitable for convenient daily smoothies.How much should you spend, and what are the key features to look for?You can pick up a basic jug-style blender for as little as £25, but it may lack power. You may also find that blades and other removable parts may not last as long if it’s in use every day. Thinner plastic jugs and lids tend to be more prone to breakage, so it’s worth investing in a blender with a robust, thick plastic or glass jug if you can, and a snugly fitting lid. For a longer lifespan, clean the parts by hand rather than in the dishwasher. The combination of hot temperatures and the slightly abrasive nature of dishwasher detergents tends to wear away at parts faster than if you wash them by hand.Personal blenders tend to be cheaper, starting from £20. Affordable options can be low power, though, so check the wattage. From £50 upwards, the price is usually dictated by the number of accessories. The same goes for stick blenders: as little as £15 will buy you one, but you’ll need to spend more like £30-60 if you need a lot of power or accessories.If you’re keen to save and don’t need a box-fresh appliance, a refurbished or returned blender could be a good option. TryAmazon’s Second Chancestore; direct from the retailer, such asVitamix’s reconditioned blenders; or a specialist refurbished retailer, such asBack Market.For any refurbished appliance, check that it comes with a warranty and customer support in case of any problems (a phone number or chat facility is good; a form or email address, less so). Also, check the product is in good order before you start to use it: don’t worry about minor scratches on parts that aren’t in contact with food, but return appliances if the jug or containers have chips or cracks. Likewise, if power cables show any damage, return the item without using it.How to clean your blenderThere are two basic ways to clean a blender: quick or deep.Quick cleans work best straight after use. Fill the jug halfway with warm water, add a couple of drops of washing-up liquid, pop on the lid and run for about a minute (pricier blenders may have a self-cleaning program, which will time it for you). If you often blend seeds or nuts, occasionally add 50ml of white vinegar to the warm, soapy water to help remove residue. Afterwards, rinse thoroughly.The quick method doesn’t always remove debris under the blades, however. For that, you’ll need a deep clean. If you’re hand washing, equip yourself with an angled brush for scrubbing around the blades. Detachable blade units will be easier to clean, but if the blades are fixed and there’s stubborn debris, fill with warm water and washing-up liquid, and leave to soak before cleaning. Or if your blender jug is dishwasher safe, it can do a deep clean for you.No matter what method you use, blender jugs can become cloudy. To bring back the shine, mix bicarbonate of soda with enough water to make a paste, apply to the interior, leave for half an hour, then lightly scrub with a wet sponge: this should remove the film.For more kitchen inspiration, read our guide onthe best slow cookersRachel Ogden has worked as a consumer journalist for decades, becoming an expert unboxer before it was a thing, although she’s much less successful at repacking.

Where else will you get explosions, witches and lacy ruffs all on the same bill? Step right up to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery for The World of James VI and I. James has become more box-office friendly lately, because of his passionate friendships with a series of male favourites, including the Duke of Buckingham, as seen on TV. You’ll find portraits of his favourite men here, the lushest by far being Rubens’ 1625 painting of Buckingham, his cheeks flushed, moustache neatly upturned, eyes flashing. There’s an astrological watch, too, in an egg-shaped silver case that James presented to another favourite, the Earl of Somerset.This exhibition refuses, however, to pin down the exact nature of James’s sexuality, seeing it as just part of his times. When his voyage home from Elsinore Castle with his new bride was hit by storms, he blamed witches. His book Daemonologie incited Scottish witch-hunting and inspired Shakespeare to write Macbeth. The world he lived in was full of invisible magical forces. On view are relics of that universe, including a bezoar, to protect from poison, and the Charmstone of the Stewarts of Ardsheal.View image in fullscreenDouble portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots and James VI, 1580s, unknown artist.Photograph: Stephen Farthing/Blair Castle, Perthshire.If James was superstitious and hungry for love, his violent childhood may explain it. A wonderfully weird painting shows him as a child praying by the monument of his father, Lord Darnley, murdered in 1567 by the unusual method of blowing up the house where he was staying in Edinburgh. A print portrays the beheading of his mother in 1587.These are strange events from a time in history that is alien to us, yet the portraits here make us feel close to these people. James’s jester, Tom Derry, is utterly alive in a careworn, sensitive portrait by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger. As for the king himself, he goes through many changes. The virtual twin of Mary, Queen of Scots in a 1583 double portrait, even more “feminine” in a ruff-heavy painting a few years later, increasingly louche yet roughed up in later portraits. This terrific exhibition brings history to life without battering it into a 21st-century plaything.View image in fullscreenRavishing … Wael Shawky’s Cabaret Crusades III: The Secrets of Karbala, installation view, at Talbot Rice Gallery, 2025.Photograph: Sally JubbAn even more remote past is magically, jerkily performed by glass marionettes in Wael Shawky’s Cabaret Crusades III: The Secrets of Karbala. This ravishing film work at Talbot Rice Gallery is already an acknowledged classic of 21st-century art and comes to Edinburgh at a time when war again rages in the lands where, in the 11th and 12th centuries AD, Christians and Muslims fought for Jerusalem. You won’t find glib contemporary parallels in Egyptian artist Shawky’s screen epic. He does everything possible to estrange the Crusades, acted by puppets as if this were a slow, contemplative Thunderbirds.Cabaret Crusades takes you not just to another time but another way of telling it, in its own words. He refutes the historical nonsense of jihadis treating the Crusades as a living grievance just as much as he recovers an Arab view of a story often told through western sources. This is, in short, a phenomenally serious and complex achievement that is also hypnotically beautiful.View image in fullscreenDingy, derelict, claustrophobic … Mike Nelson’s installation at Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh.Photograph: Mike Nelson/303 Gallery/Galleria Franco Noero\\ Matt’s Gallery/neugerriemschneiderThe Middle Eastern past appears again as enigmatic, poetic ruins in Mike Nelson’s photographs of a ruinous Turkish city at Fruitmarket Gallery. They are hung at the bottom of the gallery walls, with bare lightbulbs and low benches, to encourage intimacy with how the artist imagines this lost world. Roland Barthes wrote of his fixation on a 19th-century photograph of the Alhambra: “I want to live there.”Nelson confesses something similar, then undercuts it with an installation in another part of the gallery representing a now-demolished housing estate: a reconstruction that becomes an impossible, ensnaring labyrinth. As you move through one dingy, derelict claustrophobic room and corridor after another, anxiety mounts. Where is this leading? The Edinburgh Dungeon next door has nothing on this. You can never go back to the past, says Nelson. If you did it would be a nightmare.View image in fullscreenHaunting … Aubrey Levinthal’s Couch (Three Boys), 2025.Photograph: Aubrey Levinthal/Ingleby, Edinburgh/Neighboring StatesIn general, art that is ambivalent and poetic has more to say than art that is simplistic and didactic. Unfortunately, there is some of the latter in Edinburgh, too. Siân Davey’s exhibition The Garden at the Stills Gallery takes the opposite of Shawky’s thoughtful approach. Davey and her son created a wildflower garden and invited their friends and neighbours to share this healing space. Good for them. But Davey’s big intensely coloured photos of her garden community, with herself and other people going nude in nature, are pure bathos. To make me believe this flowery paradise is a shelter and hope for the marginalised and oppressed, I would need more than mawkish oversharing. This is flower-power nonsense, half a century too late.Recovering from that, I turn to Aubrey Levinthal’s nuanced, elusive paintings at the Ingleby. The gallery is well worth seeking out, tucked down a side street in the classical New Town, and in Levinthal it has discovered a major contemporary painter. She depicts her quiet, middle-class family life in Philadelphia, but it is the way she paints it that’s wondrous.Planes of almost abstract colour turn out to be sofas or laptops. A vase of Hockneyesque flowers seems to emerge from a boy resting on a sofa; the man in her life, in a nice reversal of art’s old hierarchies, is portrayed as a classical bearded beauty, sprawled in a chair, her idealised, brainless muse.In the most haunting painting here, she studies her son, in a triple image, as he contemplates a glowing iPad screen. It’s a painting for our times.Until24 AugustExplore more on these topicsArtPhotographyPaintingEdinburghreviewsShareReuse this content"

She is not, in any traditional sense, an influencer. Like millions of other women around the world, she posts her daily outfits toTikTok, where she has a frankly paltry 1,624 followers, andInstagram, where she has 1,251. Yet despite being in every sense an ordinary woman on the internet, Howell estimates that she has made more than $500 just from posting to social media.She does this by posting a video of her outfit or her makeup and reminding viewers – many of whom are people she knows personally – that they can buy the same item via a link in her bio.Howell uses apps called ShopMy and LTK to earn a cut of the sales for every pair of jeans, lip gloss or button-up shirt she inspires people to buy. These apps promise they can makeanyone an influencer. You don’t have to be a former Bachelorette contestant or nepo baby to take part in flogging products to your fans. About 1,000 or so followers will qualify you.View image in fullscreenShelbi Howell posts daily content about being a stay-at-home mom on Instagram and TikTok.Photograph: Shelbi HowellRepresentatives for ShopMy, which is currentlyvaluedat $410m, say that they have around 90,000 users with less than 500,000 followers who drive $500m in sales. They position themselves as a creative way to make some extra cash. “We’ve always believed that real influence isn’t about how many followers someone has,” said Caley-Rae Pavillard, ShopMy’s vice-president of business development and partnerships. “It’s about trust, connection and the ability to move an audience.”Critics – and perhaps their friends and families, who grow tired of their posts – worry that it’s an exploitative system.“It’s almost like mega-influencers aren’t a safe bet anymore,” said Kate Stewart, an assistant professor at Jacksonville State University who studies the relationship between social media personalities and their audiences. “Micro-influencers have less of a presence, which means they have less baggage. It’s low risk.”Howell sees this as her in. “Smaller influencers are definitely more relatable,” she said. “Once you grow your following to a certain point, it’s hard to stay that way. I’m zoning in on being a mom. So I think it relates to people who might be at home and feel alone in that.”The hallmarks of influencer excess – posts bragging about private plane rides, free trips around the world and gifted designer bags – do not play as well to a general audience as they did 10 years ago. People are tired of watching rich people flaunt their wealth. Experts havedubbedit “influencer fatigue”.Redditorscreate online forums dedicated to “influencer snark”, where they gossip or rant about their least favorite personalities.It is also cheaper for brands to pay micro-influencers a few hundred dollars here and there rather than book top-name talent.Posts on ShopMy are nakedly transactional, converting friendships into tiny commissions. They are also perhaps increasingly unwelcome as social media transforms into one branded slop pile.We have ads in our streaming, on every social media platform, and now our friends are trying to sell to us tooKate Stewart, professorEven as someone who studies social media, Stewart says it feels “so annoying” to watch an Instagram friend try to monetize something online. “We have ads in our streaming, on every social media platform, and now our friends are trying to sell to us too,” she said. “We just want somewhere that’s not trying to sell anything to us.”‘Financial microaggressions’: why ‘pink tariffs’ hurt women more than menRead moreWomen who used Facebook in the late aughts and 2010s might remember the bleak experience of receiving a “Hey babe” DM from a long-lost acquaintance trying to sellYounique cosmeticsorLuLaRoe leggings. Many multi-level marketing (MLM) brands exploited women, promising them the chance to be their own boss and rack in outrageous pay. In reality, the vast majority of sellers made next to nothing – and relationships suffered.Affiliate marketing is not MLM, but the leveraging of friendships in order to sell product reminds Rebecca Haines of the controversial business strategy. “People use their personal networks to sell MLM products, and folks get suspicious,” said Haines, a professor of media and communications at Salem State University. “Is someone actually reaching out to me because she genuinely wants to connect? Or is she trying to sell me Pampered Chef?”Maddie Elder, a 24-year-old who just moved to the US Virgin Islands for her husband’s job, is a part-time event planner who has always been interested in fashion. “When I first started getting into it, it was more influencers who used these apps,” Elder said. “I was definitely embarrassed, or like, scared to share. But once I saw that I could make money, that didn’t matter to me anymore.”Howell’s friends have told her they also want to start using ShopMy, but they are nervous about how the posts will come off. “I tell them, you just kind of have to do it and not care what other people think,” she said.View image in fullscreenMaddie Elder said that she made ‘between’  $5,000 and $10,000 through ShopMy in one year.Photograph: Maddie ElderBut Haines worries about the potential for exploitation. Mega-influencers are paid upfront for their work; the people using affiliate links only get paid if people click.“People who turn themselves into brand ambassadors are commodifying themselves,” Haines said. “They’re performing a very narrow view of femininity, and hoping to get rewards from that. That’s a tough road.”Representatives for ShopMy did not share how much the average content creator makes through sales. The company’s commission rates vary depending on the type of item. Brands that are popular on social media command the highest rates – a Simon Miller dress yields 30% commission, while Asics sneakers get 3%.Elder said that in one year, she made “between” $5,000 and $10,000 through ShopMy.A young newlywed with no children, Howell says her commissions are “fun money”. It’s also cyclical. She will make money from a ShopMy item and then use the cash to buy more clothes – which she will eventually post on ShopMy, too.Elder describes it as a “reinvestment”. The money she makes goes “back into shopping”.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleSocial mediaShopping tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianWhen Ian Foxley found evidence of corruption while working at a British company in Riyadh, he alerted the MoD. He didn’t know he’d stumbled upon one of its most closely guarded secretsByDavid PeggThu 7 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 12.12 EDTShareThree days before he fledSaudi Arabia, Ian Foxley was summoned to his boss’s office on the 22nd floor of a Riyadh skyscraper and told to either resign or be sacked. He had been in the job for just six months and it was clear to him that something in the organisation was badly wrong – but he did not suspect that he would soon be in fear of his life.It was in May 2010, while reading the Sunday Times at home in a village near York, that Foxley had spotted the job advert. A company was looking for someone to oversee the expansion of a British army programme in Saudi Arabia called Sangcom. Worth £150m when first agreed in 1978, the programme had grown into a £2bn deal for the UK government to supply the Saudi Arabian national guard with everything from encrypted radios to satellite communications and fibre optics.Foxley hadn’t heard of Sangcom, but it was well known among graduates of the Royal corps of Signals, the British army specialist communications division, where Foxley had been a lieutenant colonel. In theory, Sangcom was run by a few dozen UKMinistry of Defencespecialists in Riyadh; in practice, the programme was almost entirely managed by GPT Special Project Management, a contractor hired by the British government. As and when the Saudis wanted to upgrade their military communications, GPT would draft suggestions for what they might like to buy from the British. In spring 2010, the Saudis decided to buy more equipment via Sangcom, and GPT was hiring someone to put together new spending proposals for them.For Foxley, it seemed like a perfect gig. He had worked a series of contracting jobs since leaving the army in 1998, ranging from project managing fibre optic networks for Tiscali to two years running Domino’s Pizza franchises in York. He knew other ex-Signals officers at Sangcom, who reported positive things. A preliminary interview in Dubai went well, and GPT hired him on probation.He arrived in Riyadh in July 2010, and his wife, Emma, planned to follow once he had settled in. Western contractors in Saudi Arabia typically live in compounds: gated communities complete with their own shops, restaurants, swimming pools and tennis courts, all enclosed by 12ft-high concrete walls topped with barbed wire. Foxley’s compound, Arizona, had checkpoints patrolled by armed guards and a nine-hole golf course. He described it as “a luxurious penitentiary”, and enjoyed familiarising himself with its thriving culture of illicit home brewing. (There exist specialist online retailers that sell “bakery kits” and “cake mix” to western contractors relocating to countries where alcohol is illegal.)Adapting to his new workplace was trickier. GPT’s management could be eccentric, he would later recall, and occasionally opaque. On one occasion Jeff Cook, the managing director, abruptly warned Foxley that one of his co-workers, an accountant called Michael Paterson, was “a madman” who was “going around saying people were trying to kill him” and that Foxley should not talk to him. Another time, a colleague casually joked about a Saudi general being willing to sign anything GPT suggested, on account of something called “bought in services”. Foxley didn’t recognise the term and when he began asking about it, he received only vague non-answers about “things we buy in”.At the time, Foxley considered these to be oddities, artefacts of unfamiliar business practices in a foreign country, rather than signs of anything suspicious. In November, however, Cook began criticising Foxley’s performance, and accusing him of missing his targets. GPT would later insist these were genuine objections to underperformance, but Foxley believes they were early indications that his questions about “bought in services” were rattling cages. These tensions culminated, after several increasingly difficult weeks, in the showdown in December where Cook told Foxley to choose between resignation and dismissal.The following day, Foxley went to see David Hargreaves, the brigadier who ran the Ministry of Defence’s Sangcom team in Riyadh. Foxley looked “shaken” and “shocked”, Hargreaves later told a court. According to Foxley, he told Hargreaves that something was gravely wrong with Sangcom, and Hargreaves asked him to provide proof. (Hargreaves remembered it differently: he said the conversation went no further than Foxley asking his advice on how to respond to Cook’s resign-or-be-fired ultimatum.)Driving home, mulling his options, Foxley suddenly recalled Michael Paterson, the supposedly lunatic accountant whom Cook had told him not to approach. What on earth had all that been about, he wondered? Once home, he rang Paterson’s apartment and introduced himself. A quarter of an hour later, Paterson, who also lived in the Arizona compound, was sitting down at Foxley’s dining table.“Do you know about the Cayman Islands?” Paterson asked. Over the following 90 minutes, the accountant set out a series of discoveries that implicated GPT in years of bribery and corruption. What neither man knew was that the scheme they had stumbled upon had been overseen and authorised for decades, in both Britain and Saudi Arabia, by the highest levels of government. It would be 14 years, three criminal prosecutions and two jury trials before the full truth would emerge.Bribery and corruption has been the lifeblood of the international arms trade for decades. In France, until 1997, corporations were able to offset the cost of bribing foreign officials against their tax bills; in the UK, overseas bribery was declared illegal in 1906, though it wasn’t until 2010 that the various loopholes were closed. Arms deals are valued in the millions, if not billions, of dollars, and take place in conditions of extreme secrecy for national security reasons. The products are unique, and can be bundled together with support services or complex financing arrangements, making it near impossible to discern what a fair price should be. According to Robert Barrington, professor of corruption studies at Sussex university, the international arms trade “is probably the single highest risk sector for corruption, and it has been for years”.The most common form of bribe is the commission or kickback – a percentage of the total value of a deal, usually paid to a middleman, who takes his cut before passing the lion’s share on to the politician, prince or president who has ultimate responsibility for deciding how public funds are spent. Upon receipt of the bribe, the decision-maker makes the “correct” decision as to who wins the contract. Middlemen are essential to such transactions, because they can disguise themselves as consultants offering legitimate services that might explain the payments. In the event that the whole rotten arrangement is exposed, the company paying the bribe can try to claim, however implausibly, that it had no idea the middleman was paying off the decision-maker.Paying the bribes is the easy part; the challenge is concealing them. Any payment leaving a company needs to be explained, lest auditors or regulators get suspicious, but, for obvious reasons, the true nature of the payment can never be recorded. Commission payments are therefore normally obscured under some code or rubric, the more innocuous the better. For the Sangcom deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, the cipher of choice was “bought in services”. GPT added a 16% “bought in services” fee to all of its invoices, then paid those proceeds to a company in the Cayman Islands called Simec. GPT claimed to receive “bought in services” in exchange. In reality, Simec provided no services and simply acted as a middleman, passing the bribes on to their true recipients.View image in fullscreenAl Faisaliah tower in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.Photograph: Valentyn Hrystych/AlamyMichael Paterson, the supposedly lunatic accountant, had learned much of this and his career had ground to a halt. Sitting across from Foxley at his dining room table, Paterson, a stout, plainspoken Scotsman, recounted his story. He had joined GPT in 2003 as part of the finance team, and started to hear about “bought in services” shortly after arriving. He was surprised by the nature of the payments – the flat 16% commission, as well as the degree of secrecy that seemed to surround the arrangement. But it was not his responsibility, and he served contentedly as a financial controller for three years.In 2007, however, GPT was acquired by the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (Eads), and after a corporate reshuffle, Paterson began to feel uncomfortable about signing off the “bought in services” payments. Sixteen per cent of a British government arms contract worth hundreds of millions of pounds was an enormous amount of money. What were these payments for? And who was receiving them, exactly?On 17 November 2007, Paterson emailed his bosses to record his objections to signing off the payments. On a phone call the following month, which Paterson secretly recorded, Jeff Cook and two other GPT directors put pressure on him to approve the “bought in services” payments. Paterson refused, hinting loudly that the arrangement was obviously bribery. “We all know we’re paying a percentage of our turnover to a company in the Cayman Islands,” he said. “We can dress it up however we like, but we all know what it is.” Cook tried to reassure him, insisting that the Ministry of Defence knew about the payments and was comfortable with the arrangement. “It doesn’t make it any more legal!” snapped Paterson.Their disagreement dragged on for more than a year, until June 2009, when Paterson filed a confidential complaint about the arrangement with Eads’ internal compliance department. The complaint immediately leaked internally, and within days Cook confronted him. Paterson was stripped of his duties and later placed on gardening leave. Worse still, the Eads compliance officer assigned to his complaint, a Frenchman named Philippe Troyas, seemed to think Paterson’s attempts to shine a light on the bought in services payments had placed him in some danger. At one point he texted Paterson: “Take care when out in public, same for wife.”On 4 November 2009 Paterson met Troyas, secretly armed with his recording device. “We know these payments are illegal,” he fumed to the compliance officer, in an exchange later played in court. “Eads knows it, whoever you report to knows it. Why are we having this discussion?”“Err, because we won’t be able to change it,” replied Troyas.“Eads is going to agree to carry on making illegal payments?”“Yeah,” said Troyas, adding opaquely, “it’s not in a position to stop it, because [of] the customer willingness.”This admission – that Eads’ compliance department was unable or unwilling to prevent corruption despite being handed evidence on a plate – stunned Paterson. “You can go home and resign, because we don’t need you any more!” he exclaimed. “EADS is a corrupt organisation!”“I like my company better than ethics, stupidly,” said Troyas. (A spokesperson for Eads’ successor organisation, Airbus, said that “the sentiment expressed in this historical recording is unacceptable and completely at odds with the values and ethical standards of Airbus today”. Troyas could not be reached for comment.)Paterson hired lawyers back in London, who began negotiating a financial settlement with Eads on his behalf. He spent his days on reduced duties – “surfing the internet, killing time” according to his evidence in court – for almost a year, until 5 December 2010, when Ian Foxley unexpectedly invited him round for a chat.Ever since the age of four or five, Foxley had wanted to be a soldier. He came from a proud military family, and they were pleased to see him following in their footsteps. Both Foxley’s grandfathers had been officers in the first world war. His father was an MoD official and his mother was a consultant haematologist, a committed Roman Catholic who enforced weekly attendance at mass. At 16, Foxley entered Welbeck, the military sixth form college, and subsequently joined the army. (Three of his siblings also entered the forces.) His career progressed fast: commissioned out of Sandhurst into the Royal Signals in 1975, stints in Germany, Australia, the Arctic, Belfast, Bosnia; a promotion to captain in 1983 and lieutenant colonel in 1993.Forthright and jovial, with a tendency to speak in short, clipped sentences, Foxley can spend hours happily recounting episodes from his military career or overseas adventures – helping to build a school in the Himalayan foothills, doing a sponsored drive across the Sahara, walking the Camino de Santiago. “He speaks about integrity a lot, and always did,” said Jim Dryburgh, who was an officer in Foxley’s unit. He recalled Foxley taking a dim view of soldiers who had affairs – “playing the dirty” – while deployed overseas. Hugh Bardell, another officer from the same unit, described an incident early in their shared military career, in which Foxley objected to officers using a large and mostly empty building as an annexe, while the more junior sergeants were relegated to a portable building. Unable to comprehend this obviously unfair use of resources, Foxley went into battle with the chief of staff. He won, but it did him no favours in climbing the career ladder. “He has been known to do the odd pyrrhic victory bit,” Bardell said. Almost universally, Foxley’s friends said he was stubborn, bordering on pugnacious. “He is so, so intense and strong with his opinions,” said one, a former airborne officer. Another, a former commanding officer, said that “if he thinks he’s right, he will pursue it to the death.”View image in fullscreenMinistry of Defence building in Westminster, London.Photograph: William Barton/AlamyFoxley’s rigid sense of right and wrong was set long before he discovered that his father, Gordon, was on the wrong side of the line. One morning in 1989, Foxley, then 33 and serving in Northern Ireland, was summoned by his commanding officer and informed that his father had been arrested for receiving bribes. As head of ammunition procurement for the Ministry of Defence from 1981 to 1984, Gordon Foxley had supplemented his salary of £25,000 a year with at least £1.3m of bribes. In exchange, he had redirected contracts from the Royal Ordnance Factory in Blackburn to European suppliers. Hundreds of employees in Blackburn lost their jobs after the ammunition contracts vanished; the local MP, Jack Straw, described the effect on his constituency as “devastating”.Gordon was jailed for four years in 1994, though a subsequent attempt to confiscate the bribes he received was prosecuted so ineptly that he escaped ever having to pay restitution. The Evening Standard described it as “a catalogue of errors so extensive that you quickly stop laughing and start to wonder”. The impact on the Foxley family was devastating. Gordon’s pension was confiscated and the family home sold. Foxley’s brother Paul was also jailed for six months for destroying evidence; he had been managing his father’s accounts. Foxley’s mother never recovered from the trauma of the family’s bankruptcy and social disgrace. “It destroyed her,” Foxley told me. His own career prospects in the army were permanently damaged, with his father’s conviction obstructing him at every turn. He learned that the chief of defence procurement had been heard observing that it was “too early to have another Foxley” anywhere near his department.After his father’s conviction, Foxley’s commitment to integrity – his horror of anything that seemed underhand, unfair or corrupt – intensified. “I’ve seen what happens when it goes terribly wrong and the impact it has on your family, and I’m not going to put my wife and children through that,” he told me. “I know what it was like. It was horrible.”Now, more than 20 years later in Saudi Arabia, sitting across from Paterson, the spectre of corruption was looming over the Foxley name once more. It was obvious to him what he had to do. “If you don’t reveal, you’re complicit. It’s a very simple equation,” he told me. “People overcomplicate it. You’re either on board, or you’re not.”In his conversation with Foxley, Paterson had mentioned a dossier of evidence he had compiled to support his claims. He declined, however, to hand it over to Foxley. And so, at 5am on the following day, 6 December 2010, Foxley drove to GPT’s office, hoping to arrive ahead of his boss. Once inside, he located the deputy IT manager and pulled rank, requesting access to Paterson’s emails. He located the dossier that Paterson had mentioned and forwarded it to himself, then returned to his desk. He sat down and opened the file. Inside he found emails, contracts, spreadsheets, authorisations for payments to the Cayman Islands. Cook’s signature was all over them.Foxley forwarded the documents one by one to a member of the MoD’s Sangcom team in Riyadh. He then followed up with a message. “I think we should discuss this as soon as possible please,” he wrote. Afterwards, he tried to go back to work, his mind racing as he waited for what he assumed would be a priority phone call from the MoD, followed by an invitation to a debrief and the swift commencement of an unstinting investigation.Six hours later, his mobile phone rang. It was not the MoD. “Ian,” said Jeff Cook. “Would you come up to the office for a chat please?”View image in fullscreenJeff Cook.Photograph: Serious Fraud OfficeDoes he know? Foxley asked himself. Was it possible that Michael Paterson had spoken to him since their conversation last night? He took the lift up to Cook’s office, where his boss was waiting for him, along with GPT’s head of HR, a stern-faced Saudi princess who was a niece of the king. Foxley would later give evidence to a court about the confrontation that ensued: Cook demanded to know if it was true Foxley had been sending documents to the MoD. There was no point in lying, Foxley thought. He confirmed that he had. Cook accused him of theft, and threatened to call the police and have him arrested and jailed. He turned to the princess, telling her to cut off Foxley’s access to the IT system.The Saudi princess stalked out of the office, clutching her phone. Foxley recalls Cook continuing to berate him for what he had done, but Foxley could barely hear him. Instead, his mind followed the king’s niece out of the office, as he suddenly began imagining how the next few minutes might play out: the princess ordering the police to come to the office. Arrest, detention. “Time just slows down, you’re thinking so quickly,” Foxley told me. “I was just thinking, if the princess rings the police and says ‘come and arrest you for theft’, you’re dead. I mean, literally.”Foxley realised he had one objective and one objective only: get out of the building as quickly as possible. He stood up abruptly. “This conversation’s not going anywhere, Jeff,” he announced, before marching out of the office. Cook bellowed at him to come back, but Foxley made for the lift, determined to get out before the princess returned with the police. As the lift descended, he rang his contact at the MoD and relayed what had happened. The contact told Foxley to get in his car and drive to the MoD offices in Riyadh. As Foxley raced down the highway, he worried that the police might know his registration number and stop him. “You become very paranoid,” he recalled. Halfway there, the contact rang again and told him to urgently change direction and instead meet them at the MoD residential compound; Foxley swung his car around a roundabout and sped off.Once he arrived, he learned what had happened after he leaked Paterson’s dossier: Foxley’s contact had shown the documents to Brig Hargreaves, the MoD’s Sangcom lead in Saudi Arabia, who then immediately contacted MoD headquarters in Whitehall to ask for instructions. Rather than notify anti-corruption police, Whitehall had ordered Hargreaves to hand the documents over to GPT. At this stage the significance of the dossier, or who it might implicate, was not clear to Foxley, or any of those present. But all, including Foxley’s MoD contacts, agreed that he needed to get out of Saudi Arabia immediately. “I think that the threat of arrest and jail – and the implication of that when you’re in the hands of the Saudi royal family – was too much [for the MoD],” Foxley said. “They could not deal with that, and didn’t want the implications of what that might turn into.” They discussed various options for an exit – trying to fly out of Jeddah undetected, or crossing the border to Bahrain – before deciding that simply getting the first commercial flight out of Riyadh was the best option. If Foxley was arrested, at least his friends would know where he was.Foxley drove home and packed a bag, then handed his apartment keys to a friend. (Fearing Saudi authorities might use illicit alcohol as a pretext for arrest, the friend later conscripted two soldiers into helping him destroy evidence, consuming six jugs of wine and a dustbin of beer hidden in Foxley’s airing cupboard.) Then, as night fell, Foxley’s friend drove him to the airport. At security, his friend wished him good luck and told him to text when the aircraft doors had closed. Doing his best to act casual, Foxley told passport control that urgent business had summoned him back to London. When the plane took off, shortly after 1am, Foxley was on board.For Britain, Saudi Arabia has long been an exceedingly useful partner. In 1965, the Labour government commissioned a report by the head of the carmaker British Leyland, Donald Stokes, on revitalising the arms manufacturing industry. “I believe it is vital to the country’s interest that the firms should adopt the right attitude to exports, in arms as in every other field, and I think we must be prepared to be quite ruthless in bringing that about,” Stokes wrote.When Stokes wrote his report, Saudi Arabia was not yet half a century old. Flush with oil money, it was busy buying all the accoutrements of a modern nation state, including arms, and there was intense competition between western nations over which country should be the one to supply them. Britain was exporting £130m of arms globally each year, but Stokes thought this was a fraction of what was on offer. A barrister for Jeff Cook would later summarise the scene as a “postcolonial battle between Britain, America and France; who can grab as much as possible out of this super-rich country, oil swilling everywhere, money everywhere.”An entire ecosystem of middlemen emerged to service this lucrative new sector, forging introductions between western corporations and Gulf royalty. “Good commercial agents will be of the greatest value,” Stokes wrote in his report. “Apart from providing an additional source of information, they are better placed than an official to dispenseless orthodox inducements” – that is, to pass on bribes to powerful individuals, in return for those figures agreeing to use the national coffers to buy arms from Britain rather than from other countries. Stokes’s attitude was codified in a 1977 memo by the MoD permanent secretary, the year after Sangcom was established. Payments to middlemen, the permanent secretary acknowledged, were a “difficult and sensitive area”. Civil servants should endeavour to cap them at 10% of a contract value, he said, exceeding this threshold only “with great caution”.View image in fullscreenKing Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, May 2009.Photograph: Hassan Ammar/APBribery was part of Sangcom from the start. Government documents from the 1960s and 1970s identify Prince Abdullah, then head of the Saudi Arabia national guard, as the primary recipient of British backhanders in exchange for signing off military deals. Two episodes from subsequent decades suggest that officials of the British government fully understood the role of bribery within Sangcom. In 1994, when GPT first won the Sangcom contract (it was previously handled by Cable and Wireless), one of its directors, Geoff Simmons, was summoned to a meeting in Whitehall. There, he said, the MoD’s head of arms sales informed him that somewhere in the bowels of the building was a sealed letter, signed by representatives of the British and Saudi governments, affirming that the payments to Saudi royals and their associates were necessary for the smooth running of Sangcom. (The MoD says it cannot find this letter.) GPT, Simmons later said in evidence to a court, was instructed by the British government to send money to a company called Simec, which would then pass it on to the relevant beneficiaries – the very same “bought in services” arrangement later discovered by Paterson.The second episode was in 2007. In an email from that year, Jeff Cook, who was then an MoD civil servant on secondment to GPT, informed his boss that, after some setbacks, he had successfully obtained written approval from the British government for a new round of “bought in services” payments.The letter “provides the government top cover that we wanted,” Cook wrote. “It also makes us ‘clean’.” In other words, because the government had signed off on the bribes, nobody at GPT could be held responsible. “This,” Cook wrote, “is a considerable achievement and a relief.”Back in Britain, having fled Riyadh, Foxley spent several weeks trying to compute what had just happened. “It took a long time for the details to come out to us,” his daughter Jessica told me. “I think he was almost in shock at one point.” He began to ruminate upon the possibility of Saudi agents pursuing him. At one point he sent copies of documents to a small number of friends and family, with covering notes declaring he had no plans to kill himself. If they found him dead, he wanted them to know he had been murdered.Foxley had not yet realised that the dodgy payments to Simec discovered by Paterson were not the result of a private contractor going rogue, but had, in fact, been signed off by the British government itself. And so, after three weeks mulling his options, he visited a senior civil servant at the offices of the MoD’s arms sales division in Corsham, Wiltshire. Unless an investigation was launched into the dossier, Foxley said, he would go to anti-corruption specialists at the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) directly. The MoD seemed to take Foxley’s threat seriously, and the case was referred to the SFO, where Paul Brinkworth, an agency veteran, was assigned to investigate the case in the autumn of 2012.Most SFO tips are isolated pieces of information, and witnesses are often reluctant to give evidence. Public spirited whistleblowers with large bundles of documents are rare. Brinkworth quickly realised that Foxley would make a compelling witness for any potential jury. “Because of his family background, and the burden, to an extent, that his name placed on him, he was never going to tolerate corruption in any walk of life,” Brinkworth told me. “When he thought he was encountering it he would call it out, and that’s how he came across.”In other respects, however, the case was a nightmare. Sangcom had a five-decade history that would need to be explained to a jury, and the fact that the case involved the Saudis was also ominous. Six years earlier the SFO’s reputation had been seriously tarnished by the collapse of an investigation into a British-Saudi deal bigger even than Sangcom: al-Yamamah, a monster £43bn deal for British arms manufacturer BAE Systems to supply the Saudis with fighter jets. This deal, too, had its origins in secret payments, with commissions of up to £30m being paid every few months to a Saudi prince called Bandar.View image in fullscreenTony Blair in Berlin, February 2007.Photograph: Action Press/Rex FeaturesWhen Bandar discovered in 2007 that he was being investigated by the SFO, he issued an ultimatum to Tony Blair’s government: either the SFO’s inquiries ended, or the Saudis would stop sharing intelligence on terrorist activity. Blair ordered that the SFO investigation be shut down. Anti-corruption groups denounced the decision. A judicial review to reverse Blair’s intervention failed, though not before two high court judges mournfullyobservedthat “so bleak a picture of the impotence of the law invites at least dismay, if not outrage.”Battered by near universal condemnation of its apparent tolerance of corruption, Britain appeared to change its ways. A fully fledged Bribery Act was passed in 2010, which among other things clarified that employees of a firm committing bribery could no longer plead that they were merely following orders. The MoDdeclaredthat its “policy towards irregularity, fraud, theft, bribery and corruption is one of zero tolerance” and established aspecialist oversight boardto fight graft. Later, in 2013, the prime minister, David Cameron, told the G7 that Britain would lead a global crusade against bribery and corruption. Finally, it seemed as if the country was cleaning up its act – just as Foxley arrived at the SFO’s door with a bundle of documents that threatened to drag the ugly truth back into the light.For almost two years, Brinkworth and his colleagues at the SFO worked quietly, interviewing witnesses and piecing together cash transfers between bank accounts in Saudi Arabia, Britain, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland to uncover the secrets behind Sangcom. Then, early one morning in July 2014, SFO officers sprang into action. In coordinated dawn raids, key figures from GPT and Simec, including Foxley’s old boss Jeff Cook, were arrested. In a prepared statement for an interview at Bishopsgate police station, Cook denied any wrongdoing. “My aim has simply been to follow the procedures set out in the contracts, all of which had been approved by the [then] king of Saudi Arabia and the UK Ministry of Defence and have been in place for decades,” he said.SFO prosecutions require signoff by the attorney general, and for several years after the arrests were made, the government dragged its feet as to whether the SFO should be allowed to bring the case to trial, before relenting in 2020.Meanwhile, Foxley was struggling. In the years after he first handed the evidence to the SFO, he had heard nothing about how the case was developing. After word got around that he had become a whistleblower, work as a contractor, which had previously been abundant, dried up. There was a strange irony in the fact that two decades earlier, his career had suffered as a result of his father’s corruption; now, it felt as if he was being punished for trying to root corruption out.“My dad’s always had a very steady job and an income, and it’s never been a worry. And then suddenly it was,” said Jessica. Foxley’s wife, Emma, went back to full-time work as a teacher so the family could make ends meet. Bardell, who had known Foxley for three decades, observed that he became “distinctly introvert, very unlike the Ian that I have grown to know”. Experiencing people turn their backs on him was, for Foxley, “a little bit of a surprise, and I think a great sadness,” Bardell said. “He’s probably a little bit of an idealist, in that he will always think the best of anybody, until somebody proves him wrong.”As his frustrations grew, Foxley turned his ire on prosecutors. “The longer it takes, the more embarrassing it will become,” he fumed in a letter to the attorney general. At the SFO, Brinkworth also took his share of incoming fire. “Your staff, from successive directors downwards, have been outstandingly close-lipped about either your progress and intentions or timetable,” Foxley ranted in another missive. “One day I will reveal the disappointment, frustration, and despair that the past eight years have brought and the secondary effects they have wrought on my family.”View image in fullscreenIan Foxley at home in Yorkshire, March 2025.Photograph: Gary Calton/The ObserverIn these messages, it is easy to detect the pained disappointment of someone with faith in the system now having to face its flaws. What is perhaps most surprising about the whole saga is how surprised Foxley was by it. One of his friends told me he could not understand how Foxley could not have known bribery was rife in Saudi Arabia. And surely, given the crimes of his father, himself an MoD official, Foxley must have known that it was not impossible that there were government officials involved in the corruption at GPT. But when I made these points to Foxley, he was insistent that when he took the job at GPT, the possibility of corruption on Sangcom had never occurred to him. “This was a government to government contract!” he exclaimed, incredulously.And it seemed that his father’s offences had made him think corruption in an MoD contract waslesslikely rather than more. “It’s unconscionable that the MoD, who had pursued him so hurriedly for corruption, would actually be party to corruption. I mean, it just doesn’t make sense,” he argued. “Maybe I’m naive. I don’t live in a world of horrible things.”It was not until more than a decade after Foxley blew the whistle that any cases relating to Sangcom finally reached court. In July 2020, it was announced that GPT as a corporate entity would face trial for corruption, as would Cook and Simec’s accountant, a man called John Mason. (Simec’s mastermind, Peter Austin, was too ill to face trial. He died in early 2024.)In 2021, GPT pleaded guilty to corruption. In sentencing remarks, the judge found that in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the British government had known about Simec’s role in forging arms deals between Saudi Arabia and Britain; it had also known about “high-level Saudi individuals who benefited from corrupt payments”. Some civil servants, he said, “may have known about, or turned a blind eye to, the payment of bribes over many years.”This was the moment when Foxley finally realised how deep the corruption went. Soldiers, he said, don’t tend to think much about the Ministry of Defence. “It’s where the politicians and the accountants live,” he said. “The bean-stealers or the bean-counters.” But the judge’s sentencing remarks revealed that his assumption that the government could not have been involved had been dead wrong. Not only had the government ratted him out to GPT when he discovered the bribery conspiracy, it had in fact played a decisive role in organising the conspiracy in the first place. Until then, “I did not realise the involvement of the MoD,” Foxley told me. “I had no idea.”The following year, in front of a jury at Southwark crown court, the SFO commenced its prosecution of Cook and Mason. (GPT’s guilty plea was kept secret from the jury so as not to prejudice their trial.) Foxley was the SFO’s star witness, recounting for the jury his discovery of the Paterson dossier, the MoD exposing him for whistleblowing, his dramatic escape from Riyadh.In his cross-examination of Foxley, Ian Winter, counsel for the defence, sought to suggest that Foxley was no whistleblower at all, but rather an opportunistic incompetent who had turned on his employer because he had been threatened with dismissal. Foxley’s pugnacious streak kicked in. “Are you trying to besmirch my professional reputational capabilities?” he barked. “Is that where you’re headed with this?” Winter suggested Foxley was puffing himself up. “You are trying to demean my professional capabilities for the advantage of doing down my character and invalidating my information!” snapped Foxley. “It doesn’t invalidate the invoices and the payments to Simec. You can do your worst, sir!”Farcically, two months into the case the trial collapsed when it emerged that the MoD had failed to disclose key evidence. A second trial, with a fresh jury, began in October 2023. As with the first trial, all parties – including the defendants – agreed that the “bought in services” payments were made to ensure the continuation of the Sangcom contract. Eight Saudis received a collective £10m between 2007 and 2012 alone. The question for the jury was whether the British and Saudi governments had authorised the payments in the window between 2007 and 2010, the period when the SFO had its most solid evidence of a money trail from GPT to the Saudis. If they had, Cook and Mason were innocent. In other words, if GPT, the British government and the Saudis had knowingly approved a corrupt deal, then legally speaking, any employees carrying out that corrupt deal were not themselves corrupt.In March 2024, after almost 40 hours of jury deliberation, both Cook and Mason were acquitted. Their defence – that the British government had authorised the entire scheme – had won out. Cook was convicted by the jury of a separate charge of taking kickbacks while he was a civil servant at the MoD, before he went to work for GPT. He had commissioned reports from a consultant in exchange for cash and cars, including a Nissan Primera.Foxley was in the gallery to watch his old boss get sent down for 30 months. In one of our conversations, Foxley described Cook as “a grubby little crook, quite frankly.” But, he added, “by the same call, so was my father.”Despite the acquittals of Cook and Mason, Paul Brinkworth, the corruption investigator at the SFO, spoke of Sangcom almost as a deliverance for his agency. When Foxley blew the whistle on Sangcom, people had warned that this would just be a repeat of the BAE case: the government would simply crush any attempt to investigate Britain’s deals with Saudi Arabia. Instead, GPT had pleaded guilty, and “the most sensitive, the most embarrassing, difficult case, which the government really has every reason not to like, has been aired, in all its grim glory, in a Southwark court.”Even so, reaction to full exposure of the Sangcom arrangement has been strikingly muted. Parliament’s defence committee has exhibited zero interest in the case. There has been no mea culpa from the MoD. After the trial, it issued a short statement applauding Cook’s conviction for the unrelated misconduct offence. It said nothing about historic government complicity in the Sangcom bribes. When I asked for a comment on Foxley’s account of the saga, a press officer told me “we have a zero tolerance approach to misconduct” and said staff were expected to observe government and military codes of conduct. Cook, who has been released from prison, told me in an email via his lawyers that: “I accept the findings of the jury [in March 2024], which found me not guilty of the corruption charge, and now consider this matter closed.”The Sangcom debacle has not diminished the UK’s appetite for Saudi cooperation. In December 2024 Keir Starmer travelled to the Gulf to champion closer relationships in the region. After his visit to Saudi Arabia, a British government press release touted an increased “strategic partnership between the two countries” that would “pave the way for greater defence industrial cooperation.” Starmer reportedly invited Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, to Downing Street and suggested they watch a football game together.In one of my conversations with Foxley, I asked whether the whole ordeal had been worth it. He replied in the affirmative instantly, but not without regrets. Blowing the whistle to the MoD rather than the police, he said, had been an initial, fateful mistake that altered how everything else played out. “My biggest disappointment, and my biggest failure, was in trusting a team of people that by rights I should have been able to trust,” he said. The MoD and the government “had been running the scam, the bribery, since 1978, ever since the project was set up”.‘The Saudis couldn’t do it without us’: the UK’s true role in Yemen’s deadly warRead moreFoxley is now suing the Ministry of Defence for the damage to his livelihood and career caused by blowing the whistle. “Part of not giving up this – I don’t want to call it a crusade – this pathway I’m on, to assure accountability of the MoD, part of it has to be the fact that when they arrested [my father] and prosecuted him, they were quite relentless in doing so,” Foxley said. “At the same time, they were paying bribes to the Saudis, and had been for 30 years. So the rank hypocrisy of it actually hurts.”After he fled Riyadh, Foxley spoke to his father. “I told him everything. Everything I knew,” he said. “I couldn’t be certain but I thought what it was was corruption.” I asked how his father had responded, given his own history with corruption. “‘Well, you know,” Foxley replied matter-of-factly. “‘Well done. Carry on. Follow it through.’” It was, he said, a surprisingly straightforward conversation for them both, despite their very different choices. “By then he was resigned to the fact that he had done wrong and got caught and paid the price for it,” he said. His father’s past was, for the most part, left where it belonged, and “we didn’t really talk about [it] at all.” One weekend in 2013 when Foxley went to visit him, Gordon Foxley told his son that he was sorry for what he had done. “He did actually say that it was one of the things he regretted in his life,” Foxley said. It was the first time Gordon had expressed remorse for his crime. He died the following week.A court will rule on whether Foxley’s claim against the MoD should be dismissed early next year. If not, it will proceed to trial. He has accepted the prospect of the case continuing to hang over him; it will be worth it, he thinks, if it results in the government changing its ways. “They shouldn’t get away with it,” he said, “and they shouldn’t be allowed to think that they can do it again.”Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readArms tradeSaudi ArabiaMiddle East and north AfricaMinistry of DefencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

That should be the stuff of vital debate: right now, it isn’tThu 7 Aug 2025 11.42 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 14.21 EDTShareThis week marks 80 years since the horrors ofHiroshima and Nagasaki, as the few remaining witnesses tell of incinerated, melted and obliterated families. Soon there will be none left to remember. Survivors’ graphic accounts of “the noiseless flash” were captured by John Hersey inhis book Hiroshima, read by my generation with shock and fear. Nevil Shute’s On the Beach taught us every gut-wrenching detail of the radiation sickness I fully expected to die of. Civil defence leaflets told families how to hide under the stairs with a radio and torch.I grew up expecting early death by nuclear war. My father was a 1957 founder of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament who didn’t expect us to survive inevitable nuclear holocaust. He carried a large bottle of suicide pills, enough to kill us all when the bomb fell, to save us from slowly perishing by strontium-90. When he left the jar behind driving on holiday to Wales, he had to turn back halfway there to fetch it. We lived under the shadow of the mushroom cloud. We knew that the three white geodesic domes of the Fylingdales early warning system would give us exactly four minutes, enough to boil an egg or run a very fast mile.I set off with him aged 11 on the first Aldermaston march (though after speaking in Trafalgar Square, my alcoholic father got no further than the Bunch of Grapes in Knightsbridge). But every year afterwards I went with friends on that four-day Easter march to the atomic weapons research establishment in Berkshire: it was the high social event of the year, the Glastonbury of our generation, though our fear and outrage were real too.View image in fullscreenPolly Toynbee at a CND demonstration in 1970.Photograph: Courtesy of Polly ToynbeeWhat let that sense of imminent doom fade? The Vietnam war took over most protesting energies, and now the climate crisis is evident, desperate and immediate. The nuclear threat fell down the league table of fear, though it’s as great or greater. The US and Russiashow alarming readinessto use nuclear weapons as a sabre-rattling threat. “I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Donald Trump announced in response to former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev tweeting that he would be ready to launch a nuclear strike over the war in Ukraine.In the cold war standoff, mutually assured destruction seemed to make the use of them pretty unthinkable, though neither side could gauge the other’s willingness to end the world. There were close calls, over theCuban missile crisisand the 1980s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Now neither Trump nor Putin may be rational, nor think each other rational, and either might twitch their finger on the button. To talk nuclear threat suggests first use is not taboo. Trident, our US-dependent nuclear-armed submarines, are our “weapon of last resort”.New designs can be deployed on a battlefield. Are these a more plausible deterrent or a more dangerously “usable” weapon? The non-proliferation treaty has not prevented Pakistan, North Korea, India or Israel becoming nuclear states: Iran may soon follow. Disarmament and world peace made no progress:61 armed conflictsin 2024 were the most since the second world war.Nato has fallen apart, never again certain that the US will defend its allies, whoever is president. With Russia more threatening than ever, Europe must defend itself, pulling the continent together with joint French, British and, they hope, German nuclear capacity. Unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain does not look a good proposition.Nuclear weaponsare as terrifying and as mad as ever they were, but getting rid of them and burying the knowledge to make them looks ever harder in a more dangerous world.“Don’t make us a target” is CND’s current campaign slogan. But Europe abandoning these weapons would make us Russian vassals. Jeremy Corbyn, a CND vice-president, who is in Hiroshima this week for the commemoration, said: “As we reflect on 80 yearssince the criminal bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we must ask where is the leadership in pursuing the urgent need for nuclear disarmament?”View image in fullscreenThe first protest march to Aldermaston in May 1958. Many children were among the thousands who set out from Trafalgar Square.Photograph: © Henry Grant Collection/London MuseumCriminal? The inconvenient truth is that most historians think fewer people died in those bombings than would have perished in a prolonged invasion ofJapan. That doesn’t diminish the horror.Corbyn this week called on Britain to “rethink its disastrous nuclear expansion”. But unilateral disarmament always blighted Labour’s chances, as Nye Bevan knew when he urged the party not to send a Labour foreign secretary “naked into the conference chamber”. Unilateralism, and a pledge to leave the common market, made Michael Foot’s 1983 manifesto the “longest suicide note in history”. Neil Kinnock, once a CND supporter, persuaded his party to abandon unilateralism ahead of the 1992 election.That Kinnock journey is one many of us took. But old Aldermaston songs stay embedded: “Don’t you hear the H-bombs’ thunder / Echo like the crack of doom? / While they rend the skies asunder / Fallout makes the Earth a tomb”, with its rousing refrain, “Ban the bomb, forever more!” It was a walking political education under multitudinous banners for anarchists, young communists, Quakers, the ANC and 57 varieties of socialist splinters, Trotskyite, Maoist and Stalinist.Traitors, terrorists? Bertrand Russell, aged 89, led direct action, causing mass traffic obstruction with Whitehall sit-ins: would they now be called “terrorists”, following Labour’s draconian and provocativeban on Palestine Action? Whatever their causes, atrocities from Hiroshima to Gaza deserve the right to public expression of plain, Quaker-style revulsion at monstrous inhumanity.The mayor of Hiroshimaat Wednesday’s memorial ceremonylinked the Ukraine and Gaza wars to a growing acceptance of nuclear weapons: their perpetrators “flagrantly disregard the lessons the international community should have learned from the tragedies of history”. The white doves released didn’t really suggest hope. He was right to call for a renewed urgency of a bygone age to remind those grown complacent of the reality of nuclear warfare. Forgetting that debate these days makes the unthinkable possible. Human idiocy has many ways to end the world.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 7 August 2025 – Neil Kinnock’s Labour abandoned unilateralism in 1989, ahead of the 1992 general electionExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionJapanSecond world warJeremy CorbynAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Suddenly he folds the paper up, sets it down on the table and looks across to his companion with weary exasperation. Why, he asks, does the high-minded New York Times refuse to accept that China is a turn-off?Just like George, many readers will at some stage probably have experienced a similar feeling. Perhaps it was about China, but perhaps about something completely different. Call it the “not right now” syndrome. It is the syndrome that recognises that a subject might be important, but reading a lengthy report about it can be another thing altogether.Journalists know from bitter experience that prisons are often a turn-off as well. Prisons are remote, often unpleasant places. Most people have never been inside one, and are happy to keep it that way. It is important that prisons exist, of course. They do a difficult but necessary job. Hopefully they do it well. In most respects, though, prisons are out of public sight and, as a result, out of public mind.Until they are not. Today is one of those times when “not right now” no longer cuts it. The reason is thepublication this weekof a truly devastating report by Anne Owers, the former chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales, on the mishandling of prison capacity. The report lays bare the reasons why prisons have become so consistently overcrowded over so many years to the point of frequent near-collapse. But, as it does so, it also makes clear that the underlying cause is neither a surge in human wickedness nor a rise in overzealous sentencing by the courts. Instead, the cause is bad and broken government.This is why the report, indispensable though it is for understanding the prisons crisis, is also important in a wider sense. It reads like an account of not just a government department on the verge of failure, but a whole nation state.Owers shows how overcrowding has its roots in a conflicted approach that has been deeply entrenched among generations of politicians. On the one hand, 21st-century governments have all promised more police and tougher sentences. On the other, they have all promised to cut departmental spending, to hold taxes down and to outsource programmes. As there arealmost no votersin prisons, the criminal justice system became a prime target for cuts. But the two policies were – and are – contradictory. The upshot was too many prisoners and not enough prisons or cells to house them in.This reached crisis point under Rishi Sunak’s government in October 2023, when Owers says the criminal justice system was within three days of meltdown. Early release schemes were hurriedly but grudgingly implemented. Many of the same pressures still exist under Labour today. Money is still tight and courts are still busy. Thepossibility of mass arreststhis weekend in response to Palestine Action protests is simply the latest example of the system’s lack of headroom.Owers has two particular criticisms of systemic government failings. The first is that the response to our prisons crisis between 2022 and 2024 was far too bureaucratic and repetitive. Several committees, often involving the same people, found themselves endlessly having the same discussions without triggering action. The second is that “surviving the day” then became the overriding preoccupation for government. The approach in the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), which oversees prisons policy, was to manage the crisis, doing “as little as possible as late as possible”.But there is a third, very important criticism lurking in her account. Ministers were far too slow and unwilling to face the facts. Sometimes this was true even within the MoJ itself, but the main resistance was from the Home Office, the Treasury and 10 Downing Street. The Home Office had an interest in talking tough and, as the former justice secretary Alex Chalk put it this week: “Some home secretaries’ egos will be writing cheques that the MoJ is expected to cash.” The Treasury tried to hold the line against all increased expenditure. No 10 played for time because it feared the political optics of early release schemes. The sum of these actions was government without leadership.Some of this has changed under Labour. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, did well by commissioning three important independent reports on different aspects of the criminal justice process – Owers on prison capacity,David Gauke on sentencing, and Sir Brian Leveson onthe criminal courts’ backlog– all of which (compare and contrast the Covid inquiry) have been briskly completed within a few months, their recommendations mainly accepted. The wider problems in Whitehall, however, remain. Mahmood still has to get all the changes in these reports past the Home Office, the Treasury and No 10, at a time when all three are preoccupied by Reform UK.Yet crisis processes and pressures are not in any way unique to the MoJ. On the contrary, they can apply across any part of government. Every Whitehall department has its hands tied by Treasury oversight. Think of the way the NHS, and thus the health department for England, moves into surviving-the-day mode as soon as winter looms. There are lessons in the Owers report for areas such as health and social care, welfare, policing, defence and education, as well as justice.All of this poses a collective challenge for the way that the British state is organised and does its business. It can be addressed, and perhaps answered, with skill and good fortune in one of two ways. One is by ever-more crisis management, in which, as Sam Freedman puts it inhis book Failed State, politicians and officials “keep using the machinery we have, making promises they can’t keep, pulling levers that aren’t there, filling newspapers with announcements of actions that never happen”. That approach is broken.The other approach is for a more draconian reform of priorities. The Owers report depicts a system that does not work. Yesterday’s report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchargued that, in her autumn budget, Rachel Reeves must either cut spending or raise taxes by more than £40bn if she is to balance the books without breaking Labour’s election promises. These are defining reminders of what is now at stake. It is foolish not to recognise that there are no easy choices here. The pitch has not been rolled with the public for change and the chances of success are uncertain. But it is no less foolish not to recognise – right now – that we cannot go on as we are.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrisons and probationOpinionUK criminal justiceRishi SunakConservativesShabana MahmoodcommentShareReuse this content"

But in an era of climatic decline, it shows the resilience of our fellow speciesThu 7 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareButterflies flit across my vision wherever I go this summer. Screams of swifts have been unusually audible in cities. Hedges are laden with blackberries. Hordes of plump wood pigeons devour my kale. Fruit trees bow with plums and apples. There are wasps galore and each morning I’m woken by a raucous new neighbour: a herring gull that’s moved on to the factory roof next door.Wild nature, in Britain this year, is visibly abundant. Most of us share similar stories. But is there really a blizzard of butterflies? Are there actually more swifts? Is nature in recovery after years of decline? Or is this shifting baseline syndrome in action, whereby we are so inured to decimated levels of nature that we are deceived by tiny blips of hope?Restoration is a popular notion in modern conservation. In an era of entwining extinction and climatic crisis, it is not enough to protect the tiny pockets of nature we have left. We must create new wild spaces and revive lost species. If we could only restore anEmma Turneror a Philip Henry Gosse, they would scoff, or possibly weep, at my descriptions of abundance. Today’s wildlife spectacles would be thin gruel for a Victorian or Edwardian naturalist.And yet we need not scoff at hope. It is an intrinsic part of every encounter with the natural world. If they are not suffering, fellow species lift our hearts. When I see my local blackbirds as scruffy and hollow-eyed as the most sleep-deprived parents because they have successfully reared three broods this year, I can’t stop smiling. When I discover a pair of vanishingly rare Montagu’s harriers reared four young in a wheat field –the first British breeding success since 2019– it brings new hope: next year, there could be more.This year’s hopeful abundance is nothing to do with us, not yet. The summer of 2024 was a grim, sunless season following a cold spring. It was the second worst summer for butterflies since scientific recording began in 1976. The spring and summer of 2025 have been miraculously sunny. Britain’s sunniest-ever spring boasted43% more sunshine than average. Crucially, there were few, if any, spring frosts at night, and so plants thrived, blossom set, warmth-loving insects multiplied, birds fed and chicks fledged.Invertebrate populations can swiftly bounce back.Well-studied butterfliesare useful indicators of how other flying insects – bees, beetles, hoverflies – are faring. It’s beenthe best year for the purple emperor butterflyat Knepp in West Sussex since the former dairy farm was rewilded at the turn of the century. It’s the best year for gatekeeper butterflies in my garden since I moved in 11 years ago. Species teetering close to extinction from swallowtails to high brown fritillaries have done well in a few remaining strongholds.View image in fullscreenA small white butterfly in London this summer.Photograph: Butterfly Conservation/PAAnecdotal evidence awaits confirmation from scientific surveys but it looks like a vintage summer for most breeding birds. Anglers report one of the best supplies of fish this century on my local river. Every time I take a swim, I meet a kingfisher; I’ve never seen so many. The water is clear; aquatic plant growth is rampant.What this means for the big picture is not much. Temperature graphs still point up. Biodiversity graphsstill point down. But this sunny year reveals a profoundly hopeful tendency in our fellow species: open the door a tiny crack to animals, plants and fungi and they will stampede through it.If only we were as quick to take our chance, and repair some of the damage that human hegemony is doing to the planet. I’d love to declare that noticing nature this summer and celebrating its success is another instance of hope. The noticing is significant. Awareness can lead to action.We last noticed so much nature when we were locked down during Covid in the similarly dazzling spring of 2020. We appreciated the peace, birdsong and blossom. Many of us formed new bonds with neighbourhood nature. And then the data suggests most of us returned to our human-centric lives. We took a short holiday from gobbling up the planet before resuming the feast of late capitalism.Here’s another chance: we’ve been shown again how much joy, wellbeing and real growth there can be when we live among thriving nature.Country diary: It’s amazing what one family farm can do for wildlife | Andrea MeanwellRead morePolitically, nationally, there is less hope than ever for nature. Labour is wedded to a myopic version of economic growth that will bankrupt the planet. When a government won’t even oblige multibillion-profit-making builders toinstall one £35 nest brickin every new home to save swifts and other rapidly declining birds, we cannot expect it to lead the way in living more lightly on our planet. New infatuations with energy-hungry AI will onlyfurther squeeze nature.And yet locally there is more hope than ever for nature. There is more action than ever. So many of us are desperate to help our non-human neighbours. Neighbours sow wildflower meadows. Retirees build nest boxes. Councils declarerivers have rights. Companiesrewild land.

In fact, applied to government, they can offer new solutions for global problemsThu 7 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 06.44 EDTShareIf there is one thing that has marked the first year of Keir Starmer’s premiership, it is a propensity for control – whether it’s managing hisown party, cracking down on civil liberties andprotest, or instillingfear and anxietyin marginalised groups. For a centre-left party, the authoritarian strain Starmer has shown isn’t exactly in line with the “change” from the Tories that was promised.Governments seek to control populations, politicians seek to control their parties: this is nothing new and has been explicitly promoted since Machiavelli’s The Prince was published in 1532. When leaders understand holding power as an end in itself, and see the method as controlling those they have power over, they block themselves from being able to bring about real change, because not “losing control” becomes more important than any change they seek to create. And attempting to tightly control outcomes is ill suited to an increasingly complex and unstable world.At the same time, a different mode of control exists across the institutions that implement government policy. It is rules-based, promoted by steeply hierarchical structures fostering compliance, with rigid frameworks and inflexible mindsets, alongside a culture of overconfidence. These dynamics might seem benign or indeed necessary for a functioning bureaucracy. However, if out of balance, they can stifle the creative thinking and collaboration required to tackle complex challenges. Whether it isrunning consultationswithout the intention of deep engagement or listening, or an inability toincorporate the climate crisisinto economic frameworks, by seeking to maintain control, institutions fall short of making meaningful change.Or to put it bluntly, key performance indicators and top-down thinking, combined with overzealous control freakery in government, will not have a chance of tackling climate breakdown, the cost of living crisis, the mental health epidemic or the loss of trust in politics. This situation of overlapping crises is what academics like to call apolycrisis, characterised by radical uncertainty and wicked complexity.Coming out of the pandemic, there has been increased discussion amongpolicymakersrecognising the need to acknowledge uncertainty. The value of this is clear: areportcommissioned by the European Environment Agency and published in 2002 examined more than 100 years of policymaking, highlighting areas where uncertainty was not sufficiently acknowledged or taken into account when key decisions were made, such as during the BSE crisis. The authors concluded that, on many occasions, what was missing was the need for more humility in public policymaking about what was not known, stating: “Decision-making is faced with the continual prospect of surprise. This is the condition formerly known as ignorance.”When institutions don’t acknowledge what they don’t know, they are left exposed and unprepared, and leaders obsessed with control and certainty block themselves from taking seriously differing perspectives. These dynamics are not well suited to a world that is being upended, withfascismandecological collapseon our doorstep.Dear Keir Starmer, stop cosying up to Donald Trump – or he’ll drag Britain down with him | Simon TisdallRead moreHowever, the need for certainty and control isn’t confined to the halls of power. Across psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, evolutionary biology and strands of spirituality, it is recognised that our brains are wired for certainty.Neuroscience studiesshow that the brain responds to uncertainty as a fear-based threat, triggering the threat response centrecalled the amygdala. There is an evolutionary survival reason for this, to detect and react to danger: “How will I protect myself if I don’t know what’s coming at me?” Humans’ over-alert threat response is also shaped by culture and society. We have a political-media establishment that is happy to pump out ready opinions that are not only factually baseless and untrue, but also provoke our threat response. And in times of economic decline and uncertainty, there is an opportunity for far-right groups to hijack and trigger emotional and psychological reactions towards marginalised groups. When imaginary fears are adopted andpromoted by those in power, this isn’t a mistake: it is a way to control.The dominant mode of power that continues to operate in society, and certainly in the Labour party today, is “power over”, which is built on control, domination and coercion. Leadership exerts pressure and stress, which can often make our amygdala threat response fire off. People become paranoid and go into overdrive trying to control everything. To an extent, I understand these responses. As an overconfident 27-year-old when I took on a director role, I certainly had an urge to control everything. I had to work hard against that tendency in order to lead in a collaborative way. The phrase “holding uncertainty” was useful for me, because it meant I didn’t always trust my first reaction in situations, or the narratives my brain was telling me. It reminded me to take on board different opinions, rather than simply dismiss them. Of course I made mistakes, but I was also open to examining my own controlling and perfectionistic tendencies.“Embracing uncertainty” or “letting go” has been mostly limited to the pages of self-help books, but letting go on an individual level doesn’t make sense if you can’t pay your rent, or your family is getting deported. However, if we apply it to our institutions, power centres, systems and structures, it can be a direction of travel against authoritarianism, moving us towards co-creation, pluralist thinking that goes beyond siloed categories, and building coalitions against the far right. We are a quarter of the way through this century, and theIPCC climate change reportsays that global temperature increase could be up to 5.7C by 2100, making much of the world unliveable. At the same time, fascism is on the rise. Renewing our democracies, shifting to a healthier culture, tackling the climate crisis and reorienting the economy will only happen if we shift our culture and institutions away from control.

Maxwell, too, was not initially eligible for such a transfer, due to her sex offender status; connections at the Department of Justice had to waive a procedural requirement in order for the move to go through.The transfer appears to be a reward. AsDonald Trumpstruggles to extract himself from the continuing fallout of the Epstein scandal, Maxwell finds herself, now, in the best position that she has been in since her one-time partner Epstein died in a jail cell in 2019. Suddenly, she has something that the president wants: the ability to say, truthfully or no, that Trump had nothing to do with Epstein’s sex trafficking. The president, too, has something that Maxwell wants: the ability to issue a pardon.Maxwell has always formed the dark center of the Epstein saga, a woman who appears to have been exceptionally dedicated to arranging Epstein’s life, facilitating his travel, luring new victims to his homes, and coordinating his sexual abuse over the course of decades. Alleged victims of Epstein recall being recruited by Maxwell in public places – including at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach – and through friends.They saythat sheinspected their bodies, brought them to Epstein’s homes, talked incessantly about sex, and instructed them in Epstein’s sexual preferences. They also say that Epstein and Maxwell sometimes made them available for sexual abuse by their friends.Ghislaine Maxwell is not a victim. And if she is pardoned, it won’t be for the sake of justice | Arwa MahdawiRead moreShe is widely presumed to know more than she has yet been willing to tell about the extent to which Epstein’s large network of powerful businessmen, politicians, and financiers knew about or participated in his rapes and trafficking of children. What is less clear, at least at first, is what motivated her to facilitate the abuse, and what kept her so loyal to Epstein over so many years.Maybe this kind of life – one spent attending to men’s lesser desires – was always what Maxwell was destined for. The ninth and youngest child of a British media magnate, Maxwell was doted on by her father, the Czechoslovakia-born Robert Maxwell, and raised in Oxford in a family as obscenely wealthy as it was darkly tragic: one of her older brothers was in a hideous car accident just days after Ghislaine’s birth, and the boy lingered in a coma for years before dying before her 10th birthday.Her father financed her life as a high-class party girl – first in London, and then in New York – where she spent much of her time accompanying famous and wealthy men to the kind of rich people’s social functions that have a pretext of raising money for charity. She does not seem to have had aims beyond that: despite her ample resources and encouragement, Ghislaine never showed much sign of intellectual ambition, or political interest, or business acumen, or general curiosity. (A short-lived “ocean protection” charity that she founded accomplished little, and shut down after her arrest on sex trafficking charges.) It was not merely that Ghislaine was a product of an elite unburdened by principle, who often reduce their daughters to mere ornaments. It is that an ornament, it seems, is all thatGhislaine Maxwellever aspired to be.It was not her charity, or her father’s publishing, that were Maxwell’s great passions. Her great passion appears to have been for the romantic attention of men – and specifically, her life’s greatest animating goal seems to have been to achieve, and keep, the attention of Jeffrey Epstein. From those accounts we have of their relationship – and admittedly, these are not always reliable, given how intense, widespread, and prurient the attention on their activities has been – it appears that Maxwell’s devotion to Epstein was intense. At her trial in 2021, prosecutors entered into evidence a photo of a cleavage-bearing Maxwell with Epstein,massaging his foot. This seems to have been her posture toward Epstein for the entire time she knew him: slavish, nearly worshipful.This seems to have been her posture toward Epstein for the entire time she knew him: slavish, nearly worshipfulThe pair met sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Maxwell’s father, Robert, died in an apparent suicide in the ocean off the coast of the Canary Islands – aboard his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine – in late 1991. Soon thereafter, it was discovered that millions of dollars were missing from pension funds that he managed; two of Maxwell’s brothers were charged for their alleged role in the fraud. (They werelater acquitted.) It was during this moment of rupture and imperiled status that Maxwell was romantically involved with Epstein. Her boyfriend would have served as a meal ticket as well as a source of validation: Maxwell is alleged to have received payments from Epsteintotaling more than $30m; she told one of her victims that he bought her her New York City townhouse, just a few blocks from his own. By 1994, she was recruiting and grooming teenagers for his sexual abuse.Maybe Maxwell justified what she did for Epstein as kink – a kind of sexual libertinism that shrugged off the regressive, prurient mores of the lower classes. The 90s were the peak of a kind of reductive heterosexual sex-positivity: lots of women were telling themselves, and being told, that sexual submission was a mark of sophistication – that the more liberated they were, the more of men’s desires they would grant. But this is all speculation: trying to provide a rationalization for Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions evades the true terror of her, which is her seemingly profound and horrifying vacancy. To such a person, obedience does not require a justification.Unequal desire in love – particularly when the suffering lover is a woman – tends to elicit a kind of pity. Feminists, too, oftendepictwomen’s outsized desire for men as a form of gendered victimization. Generally, it is not seen asserious –women’s limerence, romantic obsession, and striving for men’s attention is broadly relegated to the realm of the adolescent and the vulgar, the embarrassing and the silly. But Maxwell’s case suggests such desire can breed not just frustrated vanity but also a kind of monstrousness. Untempered by principle or self-respect, it can contain in it the seed of the grotesque. In her efforts to please Epstein, and to make herself useful to him, Maxwell became something hideous and unforgivable. In her deficient, warped soul, it seems she lacked something that every woman must have: a morality that she valued more than male approval.This story was amended on 7 August 2025.

As images proliferate at an unprecedented rate online, they risk losing their meaning, especially as AI poses a growing threat to the truth of what we see. We might ask why images of the relentlesskilling and devastation in Gaza, there for all to see, have not yet halted the slaughter of Palestinians.Into this situation comes Juergen Teller, “enfant terrible” of 1990s fashion photography, who has produced acoffee-table bookabout the Nazis’ concentration and extermination camp in Auschwitz. This goes some way beyond his usual remit. Teller is known for his knack for making pretty things look ugly, as a shorthand for “authenticity”, associated with the grunge aesthetic and so-called “heroin chic”, which made him the most in-demand fashion photographer of his era.The book, titled simply Auschwitz Birkenau, is published by the biggest German art book publisher, Steidl, with a cover designed by Peter Saville, the man behind so much revered Joy Division and Factory Records artworkWhat is actually in the book? Photography-wise, it is fairly bland, documenting the site as it stands today, preserved as a monument against forgetfulness as the Memorial and Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau.The selection could have been taken from an anonymous Flickr account. Like an overbearing tourist, Teller photographs every single thing he sees in Oświęcim, the town where the camp is located: from the electronic parking plates and tacky hot baguette parlours to the details of the gas chambers.There’s no hierarchy. But the haste is visible. All the pictures – more than 800 in total – were taken on an iPhone, and with stupefying simplicity: close shot of the barracks, details, then a panorama; a close shot of empty Zyklon B cans, then a wider shot, a panorama; and again and again in the same way. He uses the same approach for a pseudo-poignant “perspective through the barbed wire” photograph, and wistful closeups of melting snow-covered grass.The photographs are interspersed with memories of former prisoners, collected by Christoph Heubner, the executive vice-president of the International Auschwitz Committee, who invited Teller to carry out this project, and who is also behind the Gerhard Richter Birkenaupavilion,an exhibition spacewhich opened in Oświęcim last year.View image in fullscreenJuergen Teller during London Fashion Week in February 2023.Photograph: Kirstin Sinclair/Getty ImagesTeller’s book caught my attention precisely because of Huebner’s involvement, as it made me wonder: why would you invite a celebrity artist – a German one at that – to document Auschwitz? The problem with Teller’s book is not that he’s famous, nor that his most famous work is in fashion – it’s that these photographs contribute nothing to a deeper understanding of Auschwitz. The pictures are totally unremarkable, and get nowhere near what new photography of Auschwitz ought to strive for: to refocus our attention on something previously unnoticed.Perhaps you could argue that this is a deliberate strategy, and a more thoughtful one – for Teller to suspend his own personal style and render himself invisible. Except that he isn’t invisible. In one of the former barracks, block 27, there’s a special interactive installation devoted to various nations’ experience of extermination, including a Yad Vashem-inspired “Book of Names”: a library of books containing the name of every single documented Auschwitz victim (it is ever-expanding). And what does he do with it? He photographs all the pages with the surname “Teller” on it. Of course, thousands of German-born Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. But to single out your own name is not a gesture of solidarity – it’s narcissism.As perpetrators, the Germans strictly controlled any photographic evidence of the extermination, ensuring no documentation escaped the walls of the death camps. Indeed, there is a vital and ongoing debate about whether photography is an appropriate way to address theHolocaustat all, given that the original photographic record does not exist.Earlier this year, the Auschwitz Memorial established adigital replicaof the camp, prompted by growing interest from film-makers (at present, only documentaries are permitted to be filmed there). The only known pictures of the extermination camps are the fourSonderkommando photographs, secretly taken by Jewish prisoners and smuggled out, which have become the subject of the Gerhard Richter paintings on display at the Oświęcim pavilion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kahane supplements this with photographs of a contemporary neo-Nazi demonstration, pointing our attention towards the real and ongoing problem of antisemitism in Germany.What if the most human thing is in fact to refrain from forming an image? Kahane’s empty canvases point to a broader crisis around how to represent the Holocaust. Richter’s approach introduces unnecessary pathos, making the evil universally human, rather than an act committed by a specific nation nurtured in a specific culture. But at least it arguably opens an interesting philosophical argument.No such thing can be said about Teller’s Auschwitz Birkenau book. His view of the camp is banal, or occasionally sentimental (pictures of souvenir kitsch included). In a moment where the very legacy of the Holocaust is being politicised, it is detached and generalising, blurring notions of responsibility, while seeming worryingly like a vanity project.Visiting Auschwitz has become too easy a way for Germans and other nations alike to show how far they’ve come; that they’re now free of antisemitism. With Teller’s book in hand, maybe even that won’t feel necessary to some. As artists and as societies, we bear a responsibility to history. If Auschwitz is allowed to become an increasingly empty symbol, and we lose our ability to capture the horror of the Holocaust, how are we going to ensure that future generations understand that it really happened?Agata Pyzik is a critic and author of Poor but Sexy: Culture Clashes in Europe East and West.

Freud insisted that male identity was so rooted in the symbolism of aggressively functional genitalia that “castration anxiety” mobilised men into behaviours of dominance, control and whatever other compensatory masculine unpleasantness Donald Trump got up to this morning.When the boss was “busting your balls”, it was bad. If a situation “had you by the balls” it was bad. When a woman was a “ball-busting bitch”, she was unforgivable.“Genital theft panic” is an actual term used by actual anthropologists to describe the social terror of something nefarious stealing function from your soft bits when you’re not looking.So, here I was thinking, “Ah, yes, I don’t expect the patriarchy to care thatscientistshave found synthetic plastics in blood, placenta and breast milk, contributing toplacental dysfunction, ovarian atrophy,endometrial hyperplasiaandfibrosisin women – because I’m a feminist with pattern recognition.I don’t expect the patriarchy gives much more thought to the plastic pollution of waterways, the poisoning of animals, or the fact that there has been a trash island named theNorth Atlantic Garbage Patch– now hundreds of kilometres across – growing in the ocean since 1972. But now that there are microplastics in your balls with considerable evidence suggesting they are reducing your sperm count, inflaming your tissues and affecting both your and our species’ fertility, surely some good old-fashioned genital theft panic will kick in and patriarchy will aggressively – with much swagger – ride in to save what it holds dear.I repeat – you’ve let me down. Because, given the opportunity to literallysave your own balls,you’ve instead defaulted to a significantly less useful habit of “bullying people who utter uncomfortable truths” at conferences whenever the plastic problem is mentioned.Experts trying to communicate to the world that the projected tripling of plastic products by 2060 is a catastrophically dumbarse ideasay they have beenyelled at, harassed and intimidated by representatives of petrochemical lobbies and petrostates who make money from the ubiquitous fossil fuel-based pollution product.This is the sixth attempt at a plastic pollution treaty since plastic started turning up inbrains, livers, kidneys, blood, joints and your balls, and the UN decided “hey, maybe this is a problem?” back in 2022. The previousfive attemptshave failed.Well may some men fear that the radical humanity of feminism will deprive them of status, power and even identity – but it’s not the sisterhood busting your balls, fellas. It’s chiefly the fossil-fuel interests of usual suspects like China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US in the form of 460m tonnes of synthetic garbage spewed on to the planet every year.Now microplastics are found everywhere from the peak of Mt Everest to the depths of theMariana Trench.

Establishing a presence, and a voice, in parliament is what the leaders of growing business sectors do, and have done at least since the 18th century, when the brewing interestbegan to shiftfrom a loose grouping of MPs with family links to breweries, into a national campaign.In the five years since Michael Dugher, a former Labour MP and shadow culture secretary, became chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council, the £11.5bn-a-year industry has seen off a Tory white paper that threatened tocurb its advertising, and resistedpressure for the higher taxationthat many expected last year. Now, with Rachel Reeves reviewing gambling taxes in advance of the autumn budget, and amid growing calls for ministers to be more active in addressing gambling harms, including addiction, the organisation and its supporters are making fresh efforts to influence MPs in their favour.This week, Gordon Brown threw his weight behinddemands for higher taxesto be levied on an “undertaxed” sector, and for the money to be used to meet the roughly £3bn cost of ditching rules that restrict some benefits to a family’s first two children. This is the case also made by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) thinktank, and both it and the former prime minister are right to stress the urgency of child poverty-reducing measures. The linkage between highly profitable gambling businesses, some of which are based offshore, and grim levels of deprivation, is powerful in part because high street gambling premises, including adult gaming centres packed with slot machines, areconcentrated in poor areas.But calls for change are not confined to the political left. The cross-party, pro-market Social Market Foundation also thinks the industry should make a bigger contribution. Like the IPPR, it pinpoints the remote gaming duty levied on online casinos, with an identical recommendation that this shouldjump from 21% to 50%. Currently, this tax accounts for £1.2bn of the £3.6bn in gambling duties overall (including the national lottery), and the thinktanks are right that targeting this form of gambling would be far more beneficial than the harmonisation of rates that has also been discussed.Just as alcohol, spirits and beer are taxed differently, sports betting and gambling should continue to berecognised as distinct activities. Simplifying the tax system, which is a motive for harmonisation, cannot be regarded as the most important thing, when gambling affects so many lives introubling ways.Taxes aside, the campaign being led by Labour’sAndy Burnhamin Manchester, and Dawn Butler in London, for councils to have more say over the opening of new gambling premises, is overdue but no less welcome for that. Ministers should change the law so that local politicians have more power over planning in this highly sensitive area.Used as they are to betting shops on high streets, and football shirts emblazoned with gambling sponsors’ logos, many voters are probably unaware that regulation in the UK is strikingly lax, compared with other countries. That is all the more reason for politicians to turn down lobbyists’ invitations, and focus instead on the need for a public reckoning with this highly profitable industry’s harms.Explore more on these topicsGamblingOpinionGordon BrownFixed-odds betting terminalsSport bettingRachel ReevesAndy BurnhamDawn ButlereditorialsShareReuse this content"

The future offers both rewards and dangersThu 7 Aug 2025 13.46 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 14.34 EDTShareIn July, Scotland’s first minister,John Swinney, set out a three-stage plan to achieve separation from the United Kingdom. Part one would “build the highest levels of support possible” for independence. Part two involved a plan to “turn the heat up on Westminster” to concede a new referendum. Part three would require an “emphatic win” in next May’s Scottish parliament elections.IfMr Swinney’s plansounded familiar, that’s because it is. Previous nationalist first ministers have tried similar strategies in recent times – but all without success. Mr Swinney may meet a similar fate, because the Scottish National party looks unlikely to be able to deliver.Support for independencehovers around the 50% mark, but the UK government will not concede a referendum, while the SNP, although leading inthe pollsin Scotland, currently has the support of only about a third of voters.Assuming the polls stay the same, Mr Swinney could form a minority government next May, but not a coalition with a majority. Attempts to portray such an outcome as an independence referendum mandate would thus seem doomed to fail. The reality is therefore that independence is likely to remainoff the tablewell beyond 2026. This will not please a lot of party activists, some of whom will try to lower the bar to a second referendum at the October SNP conference.The hard truth is that the coming months will be bittersweet for the party. A fifth successive Holyrood victory would be a formidable SNP achievement, and a humiliation to Labour. Mr Swinney would also be entitled to say he had steadied the ship after the tumult of theNicola Sturgeonand Humza Yousaf resignations in 2023 and 2024. But the next Holyrood parliament looks set to be the most fragmented yet, especially with the arrival of a large Reform UK presence.The danger to the SNP, alongside the reward, is thus very real. Mr Swinney may struggle to get any divisive legislation through. Every compromise he makes will offend some party interest group or other. He is one of the last active members of the generation who have governedScotlandcontinuously since Alex Salmond’s 2007 victory. It is increasingly likely that he may face a leadership challenge at some point.Such a process is fraught with problems for the SNP. The party is a fractious place. In the past few weeks, two of the SNP’s most prominent women of the past decade have stepped away.Mhairi Black, on the left, quit the Commons last year and has now left the party altogether.Kate Forbes, the deputy first minister and a social conservative, has now announced she will not stand for Holyrood next May.These are serious losses, not just to the party but to Scotland’s civic life. Despite their many obvious contrasts, the two are charismatic and talented personalities with high public profiles. Their decisions are not flattering about the culture of the SNP, or that ofScottish politicsmore widely. Ms Forbes, in particular, gave her party and the Swinney leadership the balance and credibility that was needed in the wake of the troubled Sturgeon and Yousaf exits.Mr Swinney has said he will serve a full term if re-elected. Yetchallengersare alreadycircling, and Mr Swinney may not have it his own way. As ever, the SNP talks as if tomorrow is its to command. After nearly 20 years of power, however, cracks are increasingly hard to disguise.Explore more on these topicsScottish National party (SNP)OpinionJohn SwinneyScottish politicsScotlandScottish independenceMhairi BlackKate ForbeseditorialsShareReuse this content"

It made an impact globally – and created controversy, 6 August).David Collier implies that cerebral palsy might be the cause of this, but for many years paediatricians have rejected the belief that malnutrition is an inevitable consequence of this condition, or indeed of many other chronic diseases affecting children. Nutritional supplementation, delivered if necessary by feeding tube, has been shown to prevent or reverse malnutrition in children with cerebral palsy when appropriate nutritional needs are met.Of course, vulnerable children with chronic conditions are likely to be the first affected by the destruction of medical services, including unavailability of “specialist medical supplements”. This is hardly surprising given the blocking byIsraelof aid shipments, including food and medical supplies, and the deliberate targeting of health infrastructure and staff.Even for those determined to find alternative explanations such as an undiagnosed genetic disorder, this picture certainly illustrates severe malnutrition. I would suggest that the most likely cause for this is now obvious to most people.Dr John PuntisRetired paediatric consultant gastroenterologist, LeedsWould Muhammad Zakariya Ayyoub al-Matouq’s bones be so visible if he was living anywhere other thanGaza? How about if he was living a few miles across the border in Israel? I think we all know the answer to that. But clearly there are some individuals (no doubt well-fed individuals) for whom even this needs spelling out. Yes, that’s right, Gazan children with health conditionsdolose weight when denied food, just as much as those born healthy. And let’s not call it a man-made famine. Let’s please call it as it is: an Israeli-made famine.Shirin FareedTwickenham, LondonMany of my wife’s Jewish family and of mine were victims of the Holocaust. The world remained largely silent. We were among the few who were reluctantly given asylum in New Zealand. The Jewish cry “Never again!” is more than justified. It has not been heeded. With the western world’s complicity, the victims now are the people of Palestine, robbed of their ancestral land, massacred in the tens of thousands, tortured in Israel’s prisons, threatened with expulsion, starved by design (‘We are dying slowly, save us’: starvation takes hold in Gaza after a week of appalling milestones, 2 August), treated as less than human – all this in defiance of international law.The belated recognition of a Palestinian state is no more than window-dressing for as long as the Palestine that was remains under cruel military occupation. The time for measured language is well past. It is time for action. Sanctions ended apartheid South Africa. Archbishop Tutu held Israel’s crimes to be worse. Nato acted in Kosovo. Why not in Gaza?Is the last word to be left with the White House as children go on dying? I write as a former chair of Amnesty International UK, one of the many NGOs now naming the genocide for what it is.Peace Now is possible, with the necessary political will.Canon Dr Paul Oestreicher and Prof Barbara EinhornWellington, New ZealandWhile I agree with much of what Hussein Agha and Robert Malley say (France and Britain’s recognition of a Palestinian state won’t stop Israel’s onslaught, 30 July), the public intention to give symbolic recognition to Palestine by France and others, and possibly the UK, is nevertheless a positive step forward. It sends the clear message, from some of the more powerful states in international politics, that the Palestinian people do deserve the right to self-determination.The act of international recognition points to the lack of – and urgent need for – territory, government and sovereignty for Palestinians, whether in a one-state (“dignified coexistence”), federal-state or two-state model. Both Israel and Palestine deserve the right to self-determination, and that is an achievable goal, however repellent to the current Israeli government.Dr Raia BrowningOxfordI read your article with shock as well as horror (The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in Gaza, 31 July). What a devastating exposure of the chillingly callous use of deliberately finely tuned starvation, behind which surely lies a cruelty that many will struggle to understand.Peter MillenHuddersfield, West YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is appalling that Hong Kong activists who sought refuge here met fear, harassment and intimidation from the government they had escaped, only to receive inadequate protection and little coordinated response (Hong Kong democracy campaigner accuses UK police of asking her to ‘self-censor’, 1 August).Amnesty International has repeatedly documented the Chinese government’s transnational repression, including the surveillance and intimidation of students and activists here in the UK. This includes an alarming escalation in threats against the Hong Kong community, with bounties placed on the heads of UK-based pro-democracy activists.Last week, parliament’s joint committee on human rightsissued a reportexposing major gaps that are putting Hong Kong and Chinese activists’ freedom at risk, including the lack of a clear definition of transnational repression, patchy police responses, no dedicated reporting mechanism, and failure to collect even basic data on the scale of the threat.Initial steps taken by the government to address transnational repression are welcome, but the recent police response, as illustrated by your report, exposes the huge gap between policy and practice. The police must be given more extensive and consistent training to increase their awareness of these incidentsand must act to protect Carmen Lau and other activists’ right to free speech – they must not be complicit in silencing them.The government must now act on the above recommendations from the committee’s report. Protections must be real, visible and trusted by those they are supposed to serve. It must work with affected activists and communities to define transnational repression, track it and confront it, before silence becomes the new norm.Sara RydkvistHong Kong programme director, Amnesty International UKHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But there is a key difference: we can choose which VPN to use, but the choice of which age assurance technology to use is with the platform. When a platform I use to talk to my friends insisted I verify my age, I wasn’t given a choice about which age verification service would get my driving licence. I was expected to trust that the platform had made a good decision with my best interests at heart. That’s a pretty big ask.Instead, I elected to sign up for a VPN. I then paid for it with a payment processor of my choice, one with a proven security record. I spent several days considering and comparing the numerous options before selecting one that doesn’t keep any data – with audits and court successes to prove it. At every step of the process, I was able to choose who I was trusting with my personal data.I might consider going through the age verification process later – when I get the choice about which service to show my driving licence to. Assuming, of course, that requiring age verification for a group of adults in their 40s to share pet photos and complain about work is ultimately deemed to be within the scope of the legislation. Age verification on porn sites sounds reasonable, but it seems that many platforms are using the Online Safety Act as an excuse to conduct a data grab on a massive scale. We should be wary about who is asking for our ID when the spirit of the law is being so blatantly abused.Alex TrerythSt Austell, CornwallGeorge Billinge’s focus on tech companies such as Facebook unfortunately echoes the flawed thinking behind the Online Safety Act itself.While the act tries to distinguish between large tech companies and smaller independent sites, most of the legislation was only written with Meta and their like in mind. In practice, this means thatanysite that contains user-submitted content, be that a volunteer-run hobbyist forum or a recipe blog with a comment section, is subject to the same rules (and same fines) as Facebook or X. However, unlike these companies, these smaller sites do not have the teams of lawyers to pore over Ofcom’s 1,700-plus pages of guidance, and instead are choosing to either block UK visitors or shut down entirely.Rather than curtailing the power of big tech, as Billinge suggests, the Online Safety Act only entrenches their power further, by making it impossible for anyone else to comply.Jonathan CoatesBristolExplore more on these topicsInternet safetyOfcomlettersShareReuse this content"

The same is true of David Moyes’s attempts to build a new team to realise those ambitions.Evertonmust hope that, like Hill Dickinson Stadium, their exhaustive efforts eventually pay off.The feel around Everton is at odds with the reality of Moyes’s summer at present. The move toa modern new home– which, despite Unesco’s objections, is the finest development along the River Mersey in decades – has generated a positivity unfamiliar to Evertonians after too long in the doldrums. But it is not the only source. A blessed end to the Farhad Moshiri era, stability and common sense under The Friedkin Group, the team’s uplift under Moyes in the second half of last season, Moyes himself, with his ability to rebuild a side and connection to the fanbase, all point to a club turning their troubles around and moving forward. But the squad? Not so much.Everton took 31 points from 19 league games under Moyes last season, a dramatic improvement on the 17 from 19 collected in the fag end of Sean Dyche’s reign. Extrapolated across the campaign, Everton’s form under the returning Scot would have been good enough to finish eighth. That, in Moyes’s view, is where Everton should be aiming next and the bare minimum for a club of this stature. He want European qualification and an end to the club’s 30-year trophy drought, not a modest step to mid-table.But nine members of last season’s first team squad departed this summer – many with considerable Premier League experience – and attempts to replace and upgrade them have been largely frustrated. Moyes, now part of a football leadership team that shapes recruitment, has missed out on numerous targets with first-choice options deterred by the lack of European football and too many recent scrapes with relegation. It doesn’t promise to be a hectic end to the transfer window; it has to be one.Past five seasonsThe managerThe Friedkin Group’s first big call as Everton owner could not have worked out better. Everton were one point above the relegation zone and in dismal form when Dyche was sacked in January.Moyes was quickly invited backafter a 12-year absence and swiftly improved the team in all departments to banish relegation fears with ease. Age and the demands of the modern dressing room may have mellowed the 62-year-old, who received an OBE in June for his services to football, but he is as ambitious as ever and the perfect foreman for the reconstruction that Everton require.Off-field pictureLast season was dominated byan emotional farewell to Goodison Park, home to Everton’s men’s team for 133 years and now the new home for Everton’s women, and a stadium will take centre stage again as the club relocate to a magnificent new residence on the banks of the River Mersey. Hill Dickinson Stadium heralds a much-needed fresh start and will help improve Everton’s finances with greater commercial opportunities at the 52,888-capacity venue. Access to and from the stadium will take some getting used to, and Moyes will be keen not to lose the intimidating advantages that Goodison offered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Barry, as he prefers to be called, is 6ft 5in and had an impressive impact after joining the Spanish side from Basel last summer. He scored 11 goals in La Liga as Villarreal secured a return to the Champions League with a fifth-placed finish. An emerging prospect who cost £27m and is 23 in October, the striker fits the profile of signing that Everton want as they develop a team under Moyes.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Thierno Barry on the ball in a friendly against Manchester United.Photograph: Todd Kirkland/Premier League/Getty ImagesStepping upThe 18-year-old Harrison Armstrong is on the right pathway, although Everton’s fortunes in the transfer market may determine his next step. The Liverpool-born midfielder made his Premier League debut last season, impressed on his first FA Cup start and signed a long-term contract in February before joining Derby on loan. There was also an international debut for England Under-18s, who he captained against France in March. Armstrong benefited from 15 appearances for Derby and has looked sharp in pre-season. Another loan move has been mooted but there could be opportunity at Everton given their shortage of midfielders. A late decision beckons.A big season for …Everton’s captain, Séamus Coleman, has nothing to prove and could bow out a celebrated figure without making another appearance. But that is not how he will approach his 17th and possibly final season as an Everton player. A series of injuries limited the defender to four starts last season but his presence behind the scenes, continually upholding standards and reinforcing what it means to play for Everton, made it important for Moyes that he received another 12-month contract. Coleman led out Everton in their final game at Goodison and could do the same in their first at Hill Dickinson Stadium, but he will be desperate to contribute more on the pitch.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26EvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The move was announced two days after the 32-year-oldappeared in courtcharged with six sexual offences.Partey was bailed to appear at the Old Bailey for trial later this year, charged with five counts of rape relating to two women and a charge of sexual assault against a third woman. The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2021 and 2022 when Partey was playing for Arsenal.Villarreal fans decry Thomas Partey’s proposed signing as club’s ‘darkest day’Read moreThe Ghana international has signed a one-season contract and will join the Villarreal squad in training on Friday. His arrival hasupset fans of the Spanish club, with hundreds signing a petition urging a halt to what has been described as the “darkest day in the club’s history”.Villarreal said in a statement: “The club is aware that the player is currently involved in legal proceedings in England. The player firmly maintains his innocence and denies all charges against him. The club respects the fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence and will await the outcome of the judicial process, which will be responsible for clarifying the facts of the case. Due to the law in England in relation to ongoing proceedings, the club is unable to comment further.“Villarreal CF wishes to clearly reiterate its strong commitment to respect and diversity and firmly condemns any act of violence in all its forms, including gender-based violence, discrimination, racism, xenophobia or any behaviour that undermines the dignity of individuals.”Partey made 167 appearances for Arsenal after joining from Atlético Madrid in 2020.Villarreal beat Arsenal3-2 in a friendly on Wednesday.Explore more on these topicsVillarrealLa LigaEuropean club footballShareReuse this content"

Despite a sole Premier League win this calendar year, Ipswich were relegated with more decorum thanLeicester CityandSouthamptonand Kieran McKenna’s side are armed to attack the second tier, even if Omari Hutchinson joins Liam Delap in departing.The 40-year-old Ashley Young, who worked with McKenna at Manchester United, looks a smart pickup and consistency can help Ipswich to flourish. Birmingham, meanwhile, are aiming to repeat a feat last achieved by Ipswich in winning successive promotions and have not been shy in reinforcing Chris Davies’s squad, but there is also momentum from a record-breaking season. Leicester are at risk of a points deduction but their new head coach, Martí Cifuentes, took 32 players on the pre-season tour to Austria and has the tools to overpower opponents. The landscape of his squad will probably look different next month – the same applies at Southampton where a flurry of departures are expected – but, unlike last season, neither are likely to be caught short. For Will Still, the returning Gavin Bazunu and Shea Charles could be key pillars at Saints.Eleven teams have changed managers since the end of last season – 15 since the turn of the year – but few transitions were as messy as Rúben Selles replacing Chris Wilder atSheffield United, playoff finalists last season. Selles, who has reunited with Louie Barry, with whom he worked at Hull City last season, has the bones of a strong squad but will need to hit the ground running to win over the Bramall Lane faithful. One of those coaches who arrived midway through last campaign will fancy his chances of kicking on: Frank Lampard revivedCoventry City, driving them into the playoffs. The arrival of the goalkeeper Carl Rushworth, on loan from Brighton, addresses a problem position, though they are short of a prolific goalscorer – the Gyökeres sell-on fee may help.Playoff hopefulsMillwallfelt an uplift after Alex Neil was appointed last December and his team are primed to go close again after finishing eighth last season, with Alfie Doughty their standout summer signing.Derby Countycould be dark horses under John Eustace, who has proven his ability as a shrewd manager at this level and plans to fuse experience with youth; Rhian Brewster, 25, could prove a revelation if he can rediscover his goalscoring touch after joining on a free. WhetherWest Bromwich Albionmix it under Ryan Mason, as he begins his first permanent job as a No 1, may hinge on their marquee summer signing Aune Heggebø firing after arriving from Brann.View image in fullscreenAune Heggebø gets stuck in during West Bromwich Albion’s pre-season friendly at Blackpool.Photograph: Adam Fradgley/West Bromwich Albion FC/Getty ImagesAfter an underwhelming season,Norwich Cityhave sold their top scorer Borja Sainz to Porto, while Josh Sargent – arguably the best striker in the division last term – is also poised to depart. Norwich had a soft centre last season and have revamped things with Liam Manning joining as head coach and 11 signings, including the 21-year-old striker Jovon Makama from Lincoln and the imposing Serbia midfielder Mirko Topic. This isMiddlesbrough’sninth successive season in the division and Steve Gibson has turned to Rob Edwards in search of promotion.Stoke City, too, have been stuck in the second tier – and fortunate to avoid dropping into the third – but Mark Robins has strengthened with defensive additions Aaron Cresswell and Maksym Talovierov, who impressed for Plymouth after signing in January.Swansea City’shighest-profile summer arrival has been Snoop Dogg,joining Luka Modric as a minority shareholder, but Alan Sheehan is aiming to build on the promise shown after taking the reins in February, initially on an interim basis. Swansea have made some sensible additions including Ethan Galbraith, who excelled for Leyton Orient, but probably need another striker unless Bobby Wales – born in Dublin, signed from the Scottish club Kilmarnock and now playing in England’s second tier – proves a hit.Bristol Citysqueezed into sixth on the final day last season and while Emil Riis looks an upgrade on Nahki Wells, they do not look stronger under Gerhard Struber, last seen in this division in tears after staving off relegation behind closed doors with Barnsley in 2020. John Swift has signed for hometown clubPortsmouth, who can build on 16th under the impressive John Mousinho.CharltonandWrexhamhave been aggressive in the market after promotion and have cause to look up, towards mid-table, rather than down; for the latter, Danny Ward, Conor Coady, Lewis O’Brien and Kieffer Moore represent a promising spine.Relegation candidatesAfter a summer exodus it is over to Henrik Pedersen, Danny Röhl’s former assistant, to pick up the pieces atSheffield Wednesday, a club shrouded in uncertainty amid further turbulence under Dejphon Chansiri. There is crisis around every corner at Hillsborough, where the North Stand has been closed because of structural concerns, and the remaining players spent much of pre-season training on an artificial pitch amid delays at their Middlewood Road training base.View image in fullscreenSheffield Wednesday’s off-field woes have clouded their pre-season preparations with the North Stand (top of pic) closed.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesThe longstanding captain, Barry Bannan, has agreed to stay but aside from his commitment positives have been hard to come by. Wednesday fans are united, however, with the supporters’ trust planning a protest at Leicester on Sunday, their opening game, where the team will be backed by a sold-out away end.Hull,like Wednesday, are prohibited from spending fees on players until January 2027 – both clubs are appealing against that ruling – and after staying up on goal difference things look ominous for the the lowest scorers of last season; Sergej Jakirovic is the fifth managerial hire since Acun Ilicali took ownership three years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ivanovic, who signed from Vojvodina on deadline day last summer, scored 12 league goals last season – 10 since the turn of the year – including a sumptuoustrivelaat Luton. The forward got a chipped pass under his spell with his left shoulder, controlled the ball with his right boot and then flung a nonchalant strike into the far corner.Jay Robinson, Southampton, 18Last season it was Tyler Dibling given a chance to impress after lighting up pre-season and now it could be the turn of another attacking midfielder. Robinson, like Dibling, represented the under-21s at 15. The former QPR youngster, first elevated to the first team by Russell Martin, has been a fixture in friendlies this summer and there is a sense that a regular spot awaits. He started the final game of last season after his debut in April, the month he signed a new four-year contract.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As has been the case almost every time she has competed for the last 31 years, Williams fought hard until the end, but there was no fairytale outcome in the midwest. After two competitive sets on Centre Court, the in-form Spaniard Jessica Bouzas Maneiro knocked out Williams in the first round of the Cincinnati Open with a 6-4, 6-4 win.Things had looked particularly bleak for the 45-year-old Williams early on as she struggled to keep the ball in court, quickly falling down two breaks at 1-4 in the opening set. At 22, Bouzas Maneiro has been on the rise in recent months and her ranking of 51 belies a run of form that includes a fourth round at Wimbledon followed by a quarter-final in Montreal last week. The Spaniard showed her quality by remaining solid from the baseline, maintaining consistent depth, offering up few errors and looking for opportunities to redirect Williams’ pace.‘Love is the key, right?’ Evergreen Venus Williams plays on and on at 45Read more“I could hear their dismay as the set score started to look dismal in the first set,” Williams said, smiling. “But I’m thinking, ‘Folks, it’s not over. This is just the beginning.’ So we got to 4-4 and you can hear the excitement as well. It’s, very, very exciting to play at home. It’s just an honour.”Williams gradually found her rhythm and fought hard, retrieving both breaks as she dragged herself level in the opening set. She produced her best stretch of tennis in the second set, using her forehand to bully the Spaniard from the baseline and demonstrating the enduring quality she possesses with her destructive first serve to lead 4-3. In the final stages of both sets, however, Bouzas Maneiro’s shot tolerance, defence and composure under pressure determined the match.While a first-round loss at any event was once a tragedy for a player of Williams’ calibre and record, at 45 years old and after competing so sparsely in recent years, her expectations are low. While her victory over the world No 35 Peyton Stearns in Washington DC last month was a major achievement, she also left the court happy with how she had played on Thursday and she enjoyed the sensation of battling on the court again.Once again, Williams, who had already won four grand slam titles and reached No 1 by the time her opponent was born, was competitive, fought hard and did not look out of place against a talented player in one of the biggest tournaments in the world.“Right now it’s hard for me to be upset,” said Williams. “Of course, I want to win the match, but it’s hard for me to be [sad]. If you’re on tour, day in, day out and you lose a match, you’re like, ‘Man, I had some chances.’ I know that I lost this match because I just need more matches. After this match, I’m just thinking, ‘OK, what am I going to work on?’ instead of, ‘Gosh, I screwed that up.’“Yes, I could have played better. But the thing I feel good about is that I did go for it. No one dunked on my head. She definitely had some great shots, but I went for it, and sometimes they didn’t land, and sometimes she had some great shots. But it’s not that I didn’t know what to do. It’s just that I need to keep working on it.”After 10 days of practice, Williams will next compete in the revamped US Open mixed doubles tournament alongside Reilly Opelka and she will surely also receive a singles main draw wildcard. Although it would make sense at her age for the US Open to mark her final grand slam appearance, Williams has shown for three decades that her next move is impossible to predict.Elsewhere, Coco Gauff said she is willing to exhaust her energy reserves in service of winning her second grand slam title of the season at the US Open. “It feels like I’m pushing that nitro button and just leaving it all out there. This is the part of the season that I feel like you’re just like: ‘I just want to give it literally everything.’”In the men’s draw, Jacob Fearnley, the British No 3, fell 6-1, 6-4 to Zizou Bergs of Belgium in the first round.Explore more on these topicsTennisVenus WilliamsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

There were glaring misses, falling-outs and some telling contributions in between, before it ended with Liverpool taking a rare financial hit on a one-time club record signing. Darwin Núñez never reached the heights Jürgen Klopp predicted he would, but it was an eventful three-year ride that ensures the striker ispoised to departin the affections of many at Liverpool.Klopp led the signing of Núñez before and especially after his two appearances for Benfica against Liverpool in the 2021-22 Champions League. But he was not the only Liverpool coach to be sold on the Uruguay international’s talents, become frustrated by attempts to accommodate the forward and ultimately sideline him.Arne Slotfollowed an identical path with the mercurial 26-year-old.Darwin Núñez expected to join Al-Hilal after Liverpool agree £46.3m feeRead moreNúñez was out of favour long before Klopp left Anfield in May 2024, starting just one of the formerLiverpoolmanager’s last seven games and cutting a disillusioned figure throughout. There was talk of Liverpool cutting their losses 12 months ago.Instead, one of Slot’s first acts as Liverpool head coach was to have a video call with Núñez while he was on Copa América duty with Uruguay. The striker was flourishing under Marcelo Bielsa and Slot hoped he could also unlock the player’s explosive qualities on a more consistent basis. Getting to work on Núñez’s fragile confidence, Slot outlined how the forward would be central to his plans – literally – operating as Liverpool’s No 9 and not out on the left, where he was sometimes deployed by Klopp.Six months later, if not before, and Liverpool’s head coach had reached the same conclusions as his predecessor. It was not a simple case of Núñez’s erratic finishing driving Slot to distraction and falling short of the standards of a team chasing the Premier League and Champions League titles, although the latter point is undoubtedly true. It was also, as Slot was happy to outline in public, a question of style. The explanation he offered in January provides an insight into what Liverpool have sought to address and will continue to do so in this transfer window, with a replacement for Núñez wanted and a £110m offer for Alexander Isak remaining on Newcastle’s table. Slot wants more flexibility and Núñez was not able to provide it.“Darwin is a striker we have to use in a certain way,” said Slot, “and we were not able yet to bring the best out of him this season. He has a lot of pace but, unfortunately for him, most teams sit back a lot against us. We are still working on getting him in the best possible positions against a low block. That involves the right timings, the right crosses, the right position to start from and making the right run.”View image in fullscreenThe Liverpool head coach, Arne Slot (right), criticised Núñez’s work rate in February but there has been no faulting the forward’s effort in pre-season.Photograph: Adam Davy/PATwenty-four hours after Slot’s admission, Núñez came off the bench to score two stoppage-time goals in a2-0 victory at Brentfordthat gave Liverpool their first league win of 2025. After a faltering start to the calendar year, it was an important step on the road to the club’s 20th league title. An outrageous chipped finish in the corresponding fixture the season before was another reminder of his ability. But it was not showcased consistently enough. After the double at Brentford there would be only one more goal from Núñez in his final 20 appearances for Liverpool, the equaliser that turned the tide against bottom-of-the-table Southampton. He could also have been sent off in that game.Núñez’s injury-time rescue act against Brentford and Slot’s honest assessment of the striker’s problems came in the same month he pushed to leave Liverpool. He and his representatives wanted Liverpool to accept a £60m offer from Al-Nassr, not reject it as the club prioritised winning the Premier League over cashing in. The same message was relayed to Liverpool this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Slot denied dropping the player from the squad against West Ham in April as a result of a training ground row with a member of his coaching staff. There has been no faulting the forward’s application and effort this pre-season. Núñez returned in excellent shape and has looked sharp in friendlies, though it was clearly time for all parties to move on.Liverpool are likely to lose in excess of £20m on Núñez. The Anfield club paid a guaranteed £65m for his services in 2022 with a further £20m in add-ons. Several bonus payments, however, such as for winning the Champions League and after a specified number of starts, were never activated. Al-Hilal have agreed to pay £46.3m plus add-ons and give a striker in the prime of his career a three-year contract. A lucrative move for Núñez and a statement signing for the Saudi Pro League, no doubt, but also a waste of a headline-grabbing act.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

Sesko will travel to Manchester and undergo a medical before finalising the move.The arrival of Sesko will take United’s spending to a possible £214m, after the signings of Matheus Cunha, Diego León and Bryan Mbeumo. Sesko will be an integral part of Amorim’s front three, along with Cunha and Mbeumo, as United aim to improve on their 44 goals from 38 league games last season.It will be the first time Sesko has played professionally outside the Red Bull group of clubs. He moved to RB Salzburg as a teenager from his native Slovenia, where was playing for Domzale. An immediate loan to Liefering, Salzburg’s reserve team in the second tier, was highly beneficial and he spent two seasons, scoring 22 goals in 44 appearances.Salzburg gave the imposing Sesko his Austrian Bundesliga debut in January 2021 and two and a half years of impressive goalscoring form resulted in the natural move to Leipzig. Sesko won three titles during in Austria – though he made meaningful contributions only to the second and third – and became a Champions League regular, netting six times in 28 appearances in the competition.The 6ft 5in Sesko, who has 41 caps, is aggressive in the air but also offers pace and clinical finishing. He is not the finished article but has shown great potential and Amorim will be eager to mould him into the striker he desires after watching the struggles of Rasmus Højlund and Joshua Zirkzee.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But it might just workRead moreAnd for all the drama and speculation concerning Arthur, it has perhaps been easy to miss the fact that he has restored one of Super League’s most successful clubs into legitimate challengers again. With all that in mind, there was perhaps no better time for his side to deliver a performance that should convince Arthur his future is here in 2026.The Australian has promised in recent weeks that the performances of his team will help shape his decision. If that is true, there can be no doubting in his mind that this project is well worth buying into long-term. Leeds have finished eighth in each of the past two seasons, a position far too low for a club of the Rhinos’ stature.But after arriving last summer and inheriting a squad bereft of confidence, Arthur has put Leeds in a position where they are legitimate contenders once again. Now just two points adrift of second-placed Wigan with six rounds to go, this win against a side who could themselves have ended the night in second was sensational.It was a contest that wasn’t decided until the final minutes when Brodie Croft finally settled a compelling game that would have been a fitting playoff encounter. “This team keeps fighting so hard,” Arthur said. “That’ll hold us in good stead for some big games later this year.”His side were second best in the opening quarter against a Leigh side who were hunting a fifth successive win and are themselves contenders. Tries from Umyla Hanley and Keanan Brand made it 8-0 but a wonderful 40-20 from Jake Connor decisively shifted the momentum back Leeds’ way.Tries from Lachie Miller and Sam Lisone, coupled with a conversion from the boot of Connor, made it 10-8 to the visitors at the break and from there, they remained ahead for the rest of the evening. That said, it certainly wasn’t straightforward as the contest continued to ebb and flow.Leeds opened up a two-score lead when Connor’s magnificent kick led to James Bentley scoring, with the half-back’s goal creating an eight-point advantage. Leigh responded when a fine move led to Brand scoring his second of the evening and suddenly, the gap was just two points again.Pre-Arthur, Leeds would have wilted at this point. They may not have even found themselves in such a position against a side this good. Leigh came close to going back ahead when Bailey Hodgson had a try disallowed and Josh Charnley fumbled a golden opportunity.But Leeds held on, breaking away in the final minutes to secure what could be a priceless victory as Miller broke downfield and Croft was in support to put the seal on another statement win.When pushed on whether that performance had convinced him to stay, Arthur would only say: “I absolutely love my time here.” There is not long left to wait but whatever his decision is, it is increasingly clear he could be leading this side out in a Grand Final come October.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueLeigh LeopardsLeeds RhinosnewsShareReuse this content"

A friend refuses to offer sympathy. “You did this to yourself,” she says as I pop paracetamol. Thousands of hours of medical research are ploughed into elite sport, but where are the studies into the physical and mental demands of keeping up with it?While winter may be fiercely programmed, it’s the multi-disciplinary bunfight of summer that is the ultimate test of a sports fan. Right when our diaries demand we’re at our most sociable, our most available, our most outdoors, the calendar loses all sense of perspective and dumps events on us like it’s trying to save them from a burning building. We stand below, arms hopelessly full, desperately trying not to drop anything.England’s Chris Woakes: ‘It’s not the way you want to be front-page news’Read moreThe past fortnight has offered a pair of excellent, if contrasting, case studies. The first was the weekend ofthe Euros final; also the Lions’crucial second Testagainst Australia and England’s criticalfourth Test against India; also, my Norfolk friends’ silver wedding anniversary. They couldn’t have known, when they married 25 years ago, that their celebrations would clash with multiple major sporting events, but they wouldn’t have cared either: Nigel and Claire loathe sports, anddon’t own a TV.A better person might have respected their life choices; a true friend would have left their phone behind on the scheduled Saturday morning beach walk. My screen glowed like a tell-tale heart in my jacket pocket, one hand clutched around its silent stream of rugby union content. If humans were more advanced life forms, the information could have beamed up my arm direct to my optical cortex; instead, I had to keep stopping to roll up my trousers, take off my shoes, marvel at the view, and any other excuse to sneak a look at the screen. When the Lions were back within two points, I made my own 99 call: a tactical ice-cream purchase that allowed me to backmark the group and risk turning up the volume. It was low tide on the north Norfolk coast, and the 5G had given out by the time I was halfway to the water’s edge. The picture was frozen on a heavily pixelated scrum at the time I heard the winning try. The return of phone signal near the dunes brought the news that India were nought for two in the cricket.View image in fullscreenThe Lions’ thrilling second Test against Australia clashed with a silver wedding anniversary.Photograph: Billy Stickland/Inpho/ShutterstockExtreme circumstances are supposed to reveal your character. In my case, all it takes is a weekend in Norfolk with limited data coverage and a wifi-less bedroom. I think of myself as both a lover of the countryside and an excellent party guest. And yet when push came to shove, I wasted an entire afternoon ignoring the giant puffball mushrooms, hovering red kites and scuffling hedgerow pheasants around me, instead thumbing fruitlessly at an Old Trafford scorecard that refused to update.The Euros final was the trickiest moment to negotiate: the anniversary couple had booked us in at a fancy wine bar, where the live jazz went on until 6pm. I positioned myself at the end of the table next to a football-loving friend, and we only got busted when someone moved the ice bucket in front of us and her phone fell over, screen-side up, to reveal Lauren James being subbed off. “Is the game going well?” someone asked. “No,” we replied.By extra time we were back at the house, where we sorry-notsorryed our way into the living room with a laptop. The only three of us interested in the historic, nerve-shredding title defence tessellated our hips on to a two-person sofa and watched soundless images, while the rest of the guests sat opposite making determined conversation over our yelps, groans and explosive swears. It was, as someone noted, a room of two halves.View image in fullscreenIndia and England produced the most dramatic of Test series.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIf you think the above is ridiculous behaviour, firstly, you’re not wrong. Secondly, it only got worse last weekend. After the hijinks of Norfolk, an entire two days on the sofa with the rugby, cricket and Formula One all available on Sky Sports presented itself like a spa break. Instead, the endless flicking back and forth – between Bundee Aki’s drops in Sydney, Lewis Hamilton’squalifying woes in Hungary, and England’s rollercoaster ride at the Oval – brought on a tension headache so powerful and insistent I had to spend half of Sunday in bed, being soothed by the background burble of Test Match Special.In truth, I’ve been overdoing it since Wimbledon. It is both the blessing and the curse of the modern sporting fan to be able to have what we’ve always wanted: all the coverage, all the time. If the thing you love is available to you, who but an ingrate would cut themselves off?The ironical coda to all this wasthe knife-edge finishto the England’s Test series on Monday morning, right when most of us were back to work. Foolishly, I had arranged an unalterable hour-long meeting in the centre of London at 11am, so I recorded the game’s climax to watch on delay, and determined to get myself home without discovering the score.It took every ounce of concentration to fight my own muscle memory and resist the repeated urge to reach for my phone. Shuffling my way through the underground, I stared at my shoes like a teenager, terrified to look up in case I crossed paths with any fans on their way back from the ground. I was only a stop away when the train briefly surfaced and I heard the ping of a text.I’ve never understood, before, why Orpheus checked on Eurydice. Suddenly there I was, acting on instinct, fatally turning my head. “2-2 the only fair result!” my eyes took in, as the train plunged back into a tunnel. Oh well. Maybe it was time for an intervention. These last two weeks have not been good for me.Explore more on these topicsSportcommentShareReuse this content"

And it will not be worthy of him to be the head of state of a country that he profited from in slavery and [for which he] failed to apologise and failed to make reparations. He will not be a worthy king,” Gill said. He argued the new revelations gave added urgency to efforts to remove the King as head of state in Grenada.Baptiste’s research was verified by a University of Manchester professor, Edmond Smith, and Nick Draper, founder of University College London’s Legacies of British Slave-ownership project.Smith, who is supervising a PhD study on the royal family’s role in slavery, said as more evidence is uncovered the monarchy’s profits from slavery will become clearer. He said this payment “might well just be the tip of the iceberg”.Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.King Charles has backed the study led by Smith, followinga 2023 Guardian reportrevealing that in 1689 King William III received £1,000 ($1,343) in shares in the Royal African Company, which trafficked thousands of enslaved Africans to the Americas.“This evidence fits with long-term patterns of colonial exploitation by the British royal family, including repeated efforts to find novel income streams from colonies in theCaribbean,” Smith told Reuters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Those who received the highest dose – 36mg of orforglipron – lost on average 12.4% of their body weight, compared with just 0.9% of the control group.Home cooking and minimally processed foods best for weight loss, study findsRead moreThe trial also showed other health benefits for users, including improvements to cholesterol, blood pressure and heart disease risk.The results come afterNovo Nordisk’s oral weight loss drug, which has been submitted for approval in the US, helped trial participants lose about 15% of their body weight.Eli Lilly manufactures Mounjaro, a once-a-week injection that contains the drug tirzepatide, which is also used to help improve blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes.A weight loss pill could offer a more convenient and cheaper alternative – for both patients and theNHS– to the injectable treatments being rolled out across England.The trial has not yet been peer reviewed and its results are preliminary.Kenneth Custer, the president of Eli Lilly, said: “With orforglipron, we’re working to transform obesity care by introducing a potential once-daily oral therapy that could support early intervention and long-term disease management, while offering a convenient alternative to injectable treatments.“With these positive data in hand, we are now planning to submit orforglipron for regulatory review by year-end and are prepared for a global launch to address this urgent public health need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But one big one is … this is not a model that continuously learns as it’s deployed from things it finds, which is something that, to me, feels like it should be part of AGI,” he said, adding that, nonetheless, it was a “huge improvement” on its predecessors.During a GPT-5 launch event on Thursday, Altman said this latest version of ChatGPT was like having “access to a PhD-level expert in your pocket”. He described the previous version of the chatbot as a college student, and the version before that as a high school student.AGI’s theoretical capabilities, and the determination of heavily backed tech companies to achieve it, has led to predictions from AI executives that white-collar jobs – from lawyers to accountants, doctors and bankers – will be wiped out by looming advances in the technology. Dario Amodei, the boss of AI developer Anthropic, has warned the technology could replacehalf of all entry-level office jobsin the next five years.OpenAI said the main improvements in GPT-5 included: fewer factual errors, or hallucinations; better software coding, allowing it to create functional websites and apps; increased capability at creative writing; and, rather than “refusing” a prompt that breaches its guidelines outright, the model will instead try to give the most helpful response possible within safety guidelines, or at least explain why it cannot help.The agent feature in ChatGPT – which carries out tasks such as finding restaurant availability and shopping online – will also be able to access users’ Gmail, Google calendar and contacts, if given permission.As with its predecessors, GPT-5 can generate voice, image and text and can deal with queries in those formats too.The company on Thursday demoed how GPT-5 can write hundreds of lines of code in seconds and create tools such as a French-language learning programme. Staff said the technology is also writing less robotically and had the chatbot create a “more nuanced” eulogy. Altman said ChatGPT was a good tool for healthcare advice too, bringing on stage a woman who had been diagnosed with cancer last year to talk about how the chatbot helped her decide whether or not to get radiation therapy.The company said the upgraded ChatGPT would be better at answering health-related questions and would be more proactive at “flagging potential concerns” – such as serious physical or mental illness, too.The startup stressed the chatbot was not a replacement for professional help, amid concernsAI tools could worsen the condition of people vulnerable to psychosis.Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, said the model showed “significant improvements on sycophancy”, after the startup’s admission this year that the chatbot’s most sophisticated model hadbecome too agreeableand could distress users or make them uncomfortable.The latest model release comes as tech firms pourmultibillion-dollar sumsinto their attempts to achieve AGI. On Tuesday, Google’s AI unit outlined its latest step towards AGI byshowcasing an unreleased “world model”, while last week Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook parent Meta, said the development of superintelligence – another theoretical state of AI even more powerful than AGI –was “now in sight”.Investors’ faith in the potential for further breakthroughs, and AI’s ability to transform modern economies, has also spurred a valuation boom in companies such as San Francisco-based OpenAI. It was reported on Wednesday that OpenAI is in early talks about a sale of shares held by current and former employeesthat would value it at $500bn, overtaking Elon Musk’s SpaceX.Although OpenAIalso released two open models this weekand has a free version of ChatGPT, the company makes its revenues from charging for subscriptions to the most powerful versions of the chatbot and from integrating its models into businesses’ IT systems. Use of the free version of GPT-5-backed ChatGPT will be capped, while users on the $200-a-month Pro package will get unlimited access.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAISam AltmanComputingWork & careersnewsShareReuse this content"

It reads: “A gift from her homeland, Grenada. It bears fruit year-round, her essence lives on in its roots.”The plaque also carries Anderson’s words: “Kindly refrain from picking fruit from the tree. You are welcome to gather what nature has let fall.”Lior Berman, a local chef who has campaigned for the trees to be given legal protection, said she had turned the fruit into a marmalade for her business, Lior’s Kitchen. “It was like candied orange, but a bit more bitter. You can use the leaves for tea, or to wash your hair.”Berman said if anyone had come to remove the trees, people would have lost something special. “You want to have a relationship and a connection to nature. When you have a healthy, mature tree that produces fruit in the city, you want to protect it as much as you can,” she said.“People go way, way too far from nature. These are exactly the little things that can allow us to have that healthy connection with nature. Gardening is healthy, it’s relaxing, it’s good for your mental health.”View image in fullscreenThe plaque outside the building where the trees are located.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianThat is one of the reasons that the campaigners, including Berman and Ermakova, gave for the trees to be protected. They were concerned that because the flat belongs to Wandsworth council, that they would end up being removed.The Beatles to Virginia Woolf: UK tree of the year shortlist is rooted in cultureRead moreThose fears have now been allayed after the deputy leader of the council, Kemi Akinola, arrived at the house on Thursday to reveal the council had agreed to implement a protection order meaning there would be legal ramifications for anyone who removed them. The council has also committed to maintaining the trees.The order is interim, pending full approval, which can only be granted after a consultation period of 28 days. But Akinola said the political will was there to protect this piece of the area’s heritage.She said: “We’re trying to record the history of our Windrush generation at the moment. Because, otherwise, once they go, the stories will go.” Small pieces of heritage such as the grapefruit trees in Battersea are part of that story, she said.“Marline was the community,” said Ermakova. “Everybody in the street knows she was friends with everybody. She looked after everybody. She has three children, but I always say she probably has about 20 children because everybody calls her ‘Mum’.”View image in fullscreenFrom left: Councillor Kemi Akinola, Lior Berman and Vasilisa Ermakova in front of the grapefruit tree in Battersea, south London, planted by Marline Anderson.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianErmakova said she was happy the trees had received the kind of protection their long sharp thorns could not provide. “Happy, but a little bittersweet because, obviously, she’s not here to see it. And she would have really loved to have known it would be protected.”Ermakova said she is not yet sure how she feels, given the short period of time since Anderson’s death. “I think all of us family and friends are going to be just overwhelmed, given the funeral was only on Monday.”But she added: “If we can drive down here in 50 years and see the tree, then that will be quite phenomenal.”Explore more on these topicsLondonTrees and forestsConservationWindrush at 75HeritageCommunitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

That energy department report wasslammed by scientistsfor being a “farce” full of misinformation.Speaking to CNN this week about the national climate assessment reports, Wright claimed they “weren’t fair in broad-based assessments of climate change”. He added: “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said.In recent weeks the Trump administration deleted the website that hosted the periodic, legally mandated, national climate assessments (themost recent report is hosted on the Guardian websiteand can be read in full here).Asked about Wright’s comments on the national climate assessment reports, respected climate scientist Michael Mann said in an emailed comment to the Guardian: “This is exactly what Joseph Stalin did.”In a statement on Thursday, Dr Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and one of the authors of the sixth NCA report due in 2028 that the administrationdismissed earlier this year, said she was dismayed by Wright’s comments.“Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears – that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it.“The process for developing the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports is rigorous, with federal agencies and hundreds of scientists constructing this solid scientific foundation that decision makers, businesses and the public rely on to stay safe in a world made more perilous each day by climate change.“People across the country are already reeling from climate-fueled worsening heatwaves, floods, wildfires and storms. Lying about that reality doesn’t change it; it just leaves people in harm’s way. We urge Congress to intervene to safeguard the integrity of the NCA reports so they remain vital, lifesaving tools in the fight against climate change.”The NCA reports are published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNN that Wright was “not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports”.In May, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they would join forces to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis’s impact after the NCA contributors for the 2028 publication were dismissed.The energy department’s climate report last week was published on the same day the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal to undo the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which allows the agency to limit planet-heating pollution from cars and trucks, power plants and other industrial sources.This raised concerns that the Trump administration was attempting toscrap almost all pollution regulationsin steps likely to trigger battles in the courts in the coming years.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClimate crisisClimate sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

The numbers of lobbyists attending the talks has been rising steadily since the process started in 2022, alongside deepening rifts between nations.Negotiations stalled at what was supposed to be thefifth and final round of talks in Busan, South Korea, in December last year. The process was extended to the current round in Switzerland to give nations another chance to agree on a deal. Tensions have flared around key aspects of the proposed treaty, including calls for a production limit on plastics, managing harmful chemicals in plastics, and how the treaty’s implementation will be financed, with countries splitting into increasingly divergent camps.View image in fullscreenGreen activists make their feelings known outside the Palais des Nations in Geneva.Photograph: James Wakibia/SOPA Images/ShutterstockOn the one hand is a cohort of more than 100 nations that say they want an ambitious treaty including, among other things, global targets to reduce plastic production. On the other is a small group of oil and plastic-producing states including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran – the so-called “like-minded group” – that reject production limits and want the treaty to focus on downstream measures to tackle waste.Three days into negotiations, these separate camps seem to be further entrenched, with the United States appearing to side with the industry-friendly “like-minded group”.“They’re basically going full Maga,” said a source close to the talks. “They’re clearly coordinating with Saudi Arabia, Russia and others, because they’re using the same language.” Before the meeting in Geneva, the USreportedlycirculated a memo among countries where it openly took a stance against production cuts. The US is the world’s second-largest plastic producer and yet last year said it supported production cuts.The source also noted that the US delegation usually met environmental NGOs, scientists and industry before the talks begin, but that before the Geneva meeting they had met with industry alone.“Even under a Democratic administration, the US is incredibly industry-friendly, but it at least goes through the motions of consulting with its own citizenry,” they said. “That charade is gone now.”Two days before Ciel’s estimate was released, the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), an industry trade body, released their own statement saying that they had 136 representatives of the plastic, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing industries present at the talks.Referring to their headcount, an ICCA spokesperson said: “We are significantly outnumbered by the more than 1,500 NGO participants.” However, civil society groups say this is a false comparison, as lobbyists have comparatively more power at the talks. Ciel’s analysis shows several lobbyists appear on government delegations from where they can actively sculpt the treaty text. Their impact is also felt on the outside, as even the lobbyists who attend only as negotiation observers – a group that includes industry representatives, civil society organisations and scientists – have“privileged access”to delegates, for example, through industry-sponsored unofficial side events that are common in the margins of the talks.Tuesday briefing: What the fraught talks to reach a ‘Paris agreement for plastic pollution’ could bringRead moreJo Banner, who is part of the US civil society environmental justice delegation, and lives in Louisiana’spetrochemical industry hub known as “Cancer Alley”, highlights the disconnect between the lobbying work that industry representatives will do in Geneva and the harms that this ultimately leads to on the ground.“This is just a job for them. This is about their 401(k)s and their retirement plans. It’s life or death for us and I don’t want my obituary to be part of their resumé. We’re here fighting to protect our communities. It’s beyond being a job for us.”Last week, Greenpeace released areportshowing that seven petrochemical majors – including Dow, ExxonMobil and Shell – have collectively increased their plastic production capacity by 1.4m tonnes since the start of the treaty-making process and have sent a combined total of 70 representatives to the talks.Another factor that may have an effect on the ongoing negotiations is the death in a helicopter accident of the Ghanaian environment minister, Dr Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, who was due at the meeting alongside more than 70 government ministers next week. Ghana is the chair of the African Group, a 52-nation bloc that has favoured an ambitious treaty from the beginning.If the talks go according to schedule, an agreement should be reached by 14 August.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsUnited NationsFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after weeks of opposition from the left, environmentalists and doctors, and a record-breaking 2m signatures on a petition against a bill that would have allowed a pesticide banned inFrancein 2020 to come back into use.The “Duplomb law” – named after the conservative lawmaker Laurent Duplomb who proposed it – had been presented in parliament as a bid to free up French farmers, who have repeatedly expressed frustration over bureaucratic constraints on the agricultural sector, unfair foreign competition, and what they called stringent regulations, including on pesticides.But in a rebuke of the government on Thursday night, the constitutional council found that the law’s provision to reintroduce acetamiprid – a chemical known to be toxic to pollinators such as bees – did not abide by France’s environmental charter, which guarantees the “right to live in a balanced and healthy environment”. The constitutional authority also raised questions over provisions for water reservoirs in the bill.What has it taken to unite France’s divided voters? A hated, toxic chemical | Alexander HurstRead moreThe president,Emmanuel Macron, had “taken good note of the decision”, his office said on Thursday night, and was expected to swiftly validate the bill without these contested sections.The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said she was “very relieved” by the verdict. The Socialist party said the verdict was a rebuke to the “irresponsibility of the prime minister, François Bayrou, and his government”.The insecticide in question was particularly sought after by beet and hazelnut growers, who said they had no alternative against pests and faced unfair competition. Some growers also argued that acetamiprid, allowed in other EU countries, was vital to fight virus yellows, which cut yields by 30% in 2020 and slashed sugar output.The petition on the website of France’s lower-house National Assembly called the measure a “frontal attack on public health”. Beekeepers have described the chemical as “a bee killer”, and its effects on humans are also a source of concern, though its risk remains unclear in the absence of large-scale studies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Each one, collected from the depths of the Southern Ocean by polar teams led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, Capt Robert Falcon Scott and the Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink, tells a tale of heroic exploration and scientific endeavour.View image in fullscreenThe project gathered samples that could be compared with those found on the expeditions that took place more than a century ago.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianNow, more than a century later, Carter, the Natural History Museum’s (NHM) curator of marine invertebrates, hopes the preserved Antarctic urchins, 50 in all, will help tell a different, increasingly urgent story of modern times: how changes in the world’s southernmost waters may be affecting marine life.In January, the biologist undertook a six-week long research trip to visit the exact sites sampled by Borchgrevink’s Southern Cross, Shackleton’s Discovery and Scott’s ill-fated Terra Nova expedition between 1898 and 1913.A map showing the routes taken by Shackleton’s Discovery and Dr Carter.His voyage, part of a multidisciplinary expedition run by the National Institute of Water and Atmosphere (Niwa), supported by the Antarctic Science Platform in New Zealand, partly retraced the route made by Scott. Scott and four other explorers, including the chief scientist, Edward Wilson, perished in the ice around a month after the samples sitting on Carter’s desk were collected.In theAntarctic, which is warming at twice the global average, a lack of baseline scientific data makes it difficult to assess the physical and biological changes that have occurred over time.View image in fullscreenRobertson Bay in the Antarctic: the research focused on the impact of ocean acidification.Photograph: Courtesy of  Dr Hugh CarterCarter’s theory is that comparing the “tests” or shell of the urchins (a type of invertebrate known as echinoderms, which include starfish and sea cucumbers) in the NHM’s collection with modern samples will help reveal more about the impact ofocean acidification, often calledthe “evil twin” of the climate crisis. Acidification is caused when carbon dioxide is rapidly absorbed into the ocean, where it then reacts with water molecules leading to a fall in the pH of the seawater.Preliminary findings on Carter’s ship, the deep water research vessel the RV Tangaroa, appeared to confirm his worst fears.“We know that the ocean has been getting more acidic but in most cases we don’t know what the impacts are,” he says. “We had a suspicion that [due to ocean acidification] you would get less calcium carbonate in the water. This would make it harder to build a body if that body is made from calcium carbonate.”View image in fullscreenHugh Carter, the Natural History Museum’s curator of marine invertebrates, sorting through samples.Photograph: Courtesy of  Dr Hugh CarterCorals, sea snails, oysters and small single-celled organisms called foraminifera, a component of plankton, all rely on calcium carbonate to build shells. Calcium carbonate dissolves in acid very easily, so the more acid, the harder it is for animals such as these to survive.In June, new research showed that60% of global waters had breached the safe limit for acidification, in what scientists described as a “ticking timebomb” for planetary health.While the tests of the historical urchins on Carter’s desk were “robust and healthy”, those brought to the surface in January were thinner and more fragile in comparison, so much so that they were crushed by the force of the hose used to clean them.View image in fullscreenShackleton, Capt Robert Scott and Dr Edward Wilson on the Discovery expedition, November 1902.Photograph: incamerastock/Alamy“All the ones we collected were fragile and some of them collapsed,” says Carter. “From initial appearances, the modern specimens we collected have weaker tests than the historical ones, but we need to do more work to establish to what degree and exactly what is causing this.“There are confounding variables of course, but the fact the new ones are thinner is concerning.”The biological implications of an acidifying ocean could be enormous, adds Carter. “It could make the seas unliveable for things with a calcium skeleton.”How the ‘evil twin’ of the climate crisis is threatening our oceansRead moreDuring the expedition, the impact of the climate crisis was tangible; some of the study sites were only accessible because of melting ice. And it coincided with stark findings thatthe level of global sea ice fell to its lowest recorded level, a symptom of our warming planet.But there were positive finds on the expedition, too. Carter saw as many as 150 whales on his trip, as well as what he described as “crazy levels” of wildlife on the western edge of Coulman island, which had 17 species of starfish in just 100 metres, the same number found in all of the UK’s shallow waters.“It is a thrill to know that the environment is not as bad in some parts of the world as it could be,” he says. “It’s the only bit of the world you don’t see any plastic or human impacts from fishing.”View image in fullscreenCarter says there were ‘crazy levels’ of wildlife in the region.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianProf Craig Stevens, an Niwa oceanographer who co-ledthe Tangaroa expedition, described their work as “sweet and sour”.“This lack of ice is having knock-on effects for not only the regional ocean but the whole planet. This work is very sweet and sour. It is amazing to get the opportunity to advance the science, but at the same time, we are catching glimpses of a future for the planet that we really want to avoid. It brings home in a very tangible way the need to limit emissions of climate-affecting gases.”Explore more on these topicsMarine lifeSeascape: the state of our oceansOceansCoralScott of the AntarcticfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, the trial was called off earlier this week after Appleton pleaded guilty to stalking.Reading crown court heard on Thursday that a psychiatrist had diagnosed Appleton with bipolar disorder and erotomania, which is characterised by an individual’s delusions of another person being in love with them.The psychiatrist said Appleton would need to be monitored closely by mental health professionals and that he had not been able to say whether his fixation would end, the court was told.James Bloomer KC, for Appleton, said he had complied with previous bail conditions including not to contact Friel and was prepared to accept a lifelong restraining order.Bloomer said his client had spent more than five months in Bullingdon prison, Oxfordshire, and in Prospect Park psychiatric hospital in Berkshire. The barrister said Appleton had learned from being detained and was “absolutely determined” to do rehabilitative work.Judge Alan Blake asked probation services to prepare a report on Appleton, saying he had a “lack of full understanding and acknowledgment of the impact of his behaviour on the victim”.He said: “It is more likely [that] consistent treatment will help him to contain his feeling and reduce the risk of stalking. It is plain that, on a number of occasions, Mr Appleton has indicated that he does not think he is unwell or needs to take his medication and has desisted in so doing.”The judge agreed to bail Appleton, but declined to allow him to stay at an address in France, instead ordering him to remain at a family member’s address in Suffolk.Appleton was ordered not to contact Friel and one of family members and has been excluded from the area where Friel lives, which will be enforced by an electronic monitoring tag.Appleton admitted one count of stalking without fear, alarm or distress between 1 January 2022 and 11 December last year. He is due to be sentenced on 18 September.A website under his name appears to suggest Appleton has worked as an actor and pilot.Friel, 49, rose to fame as Beth Jordache in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside. She has beenpraised for her performancein the dramaUnforgivable, which was released on the BBC last month.In the UK, theNational Stalking Helplineis on 0808 802 0300 or email via theirinquiry form.

Our hotels are working flat out to accommodate our visitors. The kids are off school.“This is when residents and visitors want to take a dip in the sea. Surfers Against Sewage are also finding that beaches in north Wales in my constituency have pollution levels that are much too high.“I’ve written to Welsh Water … They are going to have to invest some money to stop this happening.”Dŵr Cymru is a not-for-profit that supplies drinking and wastewater services to most of the country. Data suggests it isthe worst offender of all UK water companiesfor sewage pollution.The company said that the leak had been caused by a blockage but that “foul water” did not reach the beach or “enter any watercourse and had no detrimental environmental impact”.A crew had attended to clear the blockage of wet wipes and carried out a deep cleaning using specialist kit, a spokesperson said, adding that “the issue of sewer abuse and the resulting flooding costs the company around £5m a year”.Last month, the Welsh government body Natural Resources Wales (NRW) found that in 2024, Dŵr Cymru was responsible for the highest number of sewage pollution incidents in a decade – a 42% increase over 10 years. Six serious incidents were recorded, down from seven in 2023.Dŵr Cymru has faced a slew of legal and regulatory action, including a £40m fine in March 2024 from Ofwat which concluded the company had “misled customers and regulators on its performance on leakage and per capita consumption”.Urgent changes to the sector promised by NRW include a new monitoring team, guidance on hitting improvement targets linked to new pollution reduction legislation and a tightened framework for annual performance assessments.Under UK government plans to scrap Ofwat, Wales is to get its own water watchdog. It is not yet clear whether this will be a new organisation or whether NRW will take on an expanded role.Explore more on these topicsWalesWater industrynewsShareReuse this content"

With their faces blurred, they were shown walking into a tent for medical assessment. A second film showed them being screened by Border Force staff.Questions remain over the treaty implementing the “one in, one out” agreement. Immigration lawyers say its confusingly worded terms could be challenged by anyone attempting to block their return to France.The charity that successfully challenged the previous government’s Rwanda plan said it was now examining whether it could launch a case against Labour’s “morally repugnant” policy.Steve Smith, the CEO of Care4Calais, said: “Channel crossings are driven by a lack of safe routes, and here we have the government claiming to be opening a very limited, safe route, but they are locking people up before it’s opened. These first detainees are being denied access to justice.“Lets be clear, however. This grubby deal is all about permanently denying people the right to sanctuary. Offering a safe route to one person who has a strong case to be offered protection, while denying somebody else, who may have an equally strong case, is abhorrent. It must be challenged, and we are keeping all our options open to do so.”The reciprocal scheme allowing asylum seekers with links to the UK has also begun. Applicants must satisfy the eligibility and suitability criteria, including uploading a passport or other identity documents as well as a recent photograph.Those selected will have to pass further stringent security checks and biometric controls, meaning that only those individuals whom the UK government has approved for entry will be allowed through the new route.People from war-torn and drought-hit countries such as Eritrea could be excluded from the scheme by the requirement for official documents, a charity has warned.A Refugee Legal Support spokesperson said: “This week in Calais, we spoke with many people from Eritrea and almost none of them have copies of their Eritrean passports because they were never able to obtain one. Eritrean nationals are the top nationality crossing the Channel in 2025;86% of Eritrean asylum seekers receive a positive decision, but almost all will be excluded from this scheme.”As the one-in, one-out pilot scheme continues into its implementation phase, the Home Office is also launching a campaign warning people not to risk their money or their life, to be promoted in the coming days across multiple channels.The deal has been trumpeted by ministers as a “gamechanging” deal but Home Office sources said it would apply only to about 50 asylum seekers at first.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, did not confirm how many people were being prepared to be returned to France and said the government would resist any legal challenges.“The transfers to immigration removal centres are under way as we speak, so we won’t provide operational details at this point that criminal gangs can simply use and exploit.“But no one should be in any doubt: anyone who arrives from now on is eligible for immediate detention and return,” she said.“It’s the beginning of the pilot and it will build as well over time, but we’re also clear that France is a safe country, so we will robustly defend against any legal challenge that people try.”A copy of the agreement was released on Tuesday as the prime minister comes under increasing pressure to stop boats carrying asylum seekers from crossing the Channel.TheUK will pay the costsof transporting asylum seekers to and from France. The deal will have to be renewed by 11 June next year, and can be ended at a month’s notice by either side.If people have an outstanding claim for asylum, they cannot be removed, the deal says.France can reject a requested removal if it “considers that an individual would be a threat to public policy, internal security, public health or the international relations of any of the Schengen states”.So far in 2025, more than 25,000 people have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats – arecord for this point in the yearsince data began being collected in 2018. That is up 48% on the same time last year.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeKentEnglandFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

That was 11 times the 2.88mg/kg in its cooked ham and almost four times the 8.64mg/kg in its unsmoked bacon. And it was also almost 18 times the 1.84mg/kg found in Morrisons’s bacon.Other Wiltshire ham products, including those sold by M&S (28.6 mg/kg), Sainsbury’s (21.1mg/kg) and Morrisons (19.2mg/kg) also contained relatively high levels, although Asda’s version only had 8mg/kg.Food campaigners, who want nitrites banned, said the findings were “alarming”.Cancer charities said the widespread use of nitrites showed that people should eat as little processed meat as possible, such as ham, bacon and sausages, because consumption increases the risk of bowel cancer. Cancer Research UK estimates that 13% of the 44,100 cases of the disease diagnosed each year in Britainare linked to processed meat.The analysis was commissioned by the Coalition Against Nitrites and undertaken by Food Science Fusion, an independent company, and the laboratory experts Rejuvetech. However, it found the levels of nitrites in all 21 products were well below the 150mg/kg legal limit.A spokesperson for the Coalition Against Nitrites, which includes food safety experts, medical specialists and politicians from most of the UK’s major parties, said: “It’s nearly a full decade since the WHO classified nitrite-cured processed meats as a group one carcinogen and it is disappointing and alarming that we continue to see products on sale containing high levels of nitrites.”They added: “Consumers are increasingly aware of the dangers of nitrites in processed meats, yet they continue to be exposed to their risks.”Wiltshire ham contains such high levels of nitrites because during the production process the pork is injected with nitrates, as also happens with cooked ham. However, Wiltshire ham is then soaked in a bath of brine and nitrites, to give it its red colour and protect it from deadly bacteria. At that point a chemical reaction occurs, which turns nitrates into nitrites.Prof Chris Elliott, the food safety expert who led the government-ordered investigation into the 2013 horsemeat scandal, said the research confirmed that nitrites remained “unnecessarily high in certain UK meat products”.He added: “Given the mounting scientific evidence of their cancer risk, we must prioritise safer alternatives and take urgent action to remove these dangerous chemicals from our diets.”Several food firms, including Finnebrogue and Waitrose, have responded to mounting concern about nitrites by producing bacon that is free of them.Dr Rachel Orritt, Cancer Research UK’s health information manager, said: “Eating processed meat increases the risk of bowel cancer. Nitrites … can lead to cell damage, which is one of the ways that processed meat is linked to bowel cancer. The less processed meat you eat, the lower your risk of bowel cancer.”Dr Giota Mitrou, the director of research and policy at the World Cancer Research Fund, said it recommended “eating as little, if any, processed meat as possible”.A Tesco spokesperson said: “We follow all UK and EU requirements, alongside guidance from the UK Food Standards Agency, to ensure we get the right balance of improving the shelf life and safety of our products with limited use of additives.“The nitrites levels in all of our products, including our traditionally cured Finest Wiltshire ham, fall significantly below the legal limits in the UK and EU.“Nitrates and nitrites are an important part of the curing process for some meats and they are used to prevent the growth of harmful bacteria that cause serious food poisoning.”Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents supermarkets, said: “Food safety is paramount to our members and they implement strict policies with their suppliers to ensure all products comply with UK food legislation.”Explore more on these topicsHealthNutritionTescoFood & drink industryFoodMeatMeat industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Now is the time to stand together and demand redress,” said Hotrec’s president, Alexandros Vassilikos, calling out “abusive practices in the digital market” in Europe.Booking.com called Hotrec and other hotel associations’ statements “incorrect and misleading” in an emailed statement, adding that it had not received “formal notification of a class action”.It said that the ECJ ruling did not find that Booking.com’s “best price” clauses were anti-competitive but “simply stated that such clauses fall within the scope of EU competition law and that their effects must be assessed on a case-by-case basis”.The company referred to a statement about its “commitment to fair competition”, in which it argued that “past parity clauses served to foster competitive pricing rather than restrict it”.It cited a poll in which74% of hotelierssaid Booking.com made their business more profitable, with many reporting higher occupancy rates and lower customer acquisition costs. However, other industry representatives criticised the company’s practices as extractive.“As they gained control of the market, Booking was able to increase its commission rates and exert much greater pressure on hoteliers’ margins,” Véronique Siegel, president of the hotels division of French hospitality sector association Umih, told public broadcaster France Inter.“For a room that the customer pays €100 (£87) for, if you take away Booking’s commission, the hotelier receives €75 at best, with which they have to pay their employees and invest.”Despite the friction, Booking.com appears unavoidable for many hotels, offering an online reach and visibility hard to achieve for smaller, independent establishments.A study by Hotrec and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerlandfound that Booking Holding, the website’s parent company, controlled 71% of the European market in 2024, compared with 68.4% in 2019.The corporation is valued at$170bn (£127bn), three times that of Volkswagen.Rupprecht Podszun, director of the institute for competition law at Düsseldorf’s Heinrich Heine University, said Booking.com was a classic example of how a digital platform could conquer an entire sector, creating a “winner takes all” dynamic.He said the legal action would probably be protracted and turn on the thorny question of how damages could be measured.“Judges will have to form an opinion and then it will go through all the appeals – everything at great expense and with all the tricks available under the law,” he told Germany’s daily Süddeutsche Zeitung.“The case is a revolt of the hotels, saying: ‘You can’t just do what you want with us.’”Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureEuropeEuropean UnionCourt of justice of the European UnionRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The murder charges could carry the federal death penalty, though prosecutors say that decision is several months away.One of Boelter’s attorneys entered the plea on Boelter’s behalf during Thursday’s arraignment. Boelter was in the courtroom and wore an orange sweatshirt and yellow pants. He spoke briefly to affirm that he understood the charges and thanked the judge.When the indictment was announced, prosecutors released a rambling handwritten letter they say Boelter wrote to the FBI director, Kash Patel, in which he confessed to the 14 June shootings of Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.US lawmakers balance security and openness as threats of political violence riseRead moreHowever, the letter doesn’t make clear why he targeted the Hortmans or state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who survived.The hearing before US magistrate judge Dulce Foster also served as a case management conference. She plans to issue a revised schedule with deadlines afterward, potentially including a trial date.Prosecutors have moved to designate the proceedings as a “complex case” so that standard speedy trial requirements won’t apply, saying both sides will need plenty of time to review the voluminous evidence.Boelter’s motivations remain murky. Friends have described him as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views who had been struggling to find work. Authorities said Boelter made long lists of politicians in Minnesota and other states – all or mostly Democrats.In a series of cryptic notes to the New York Times through his jail’s electronic messaging service, Boelter suggested his actions were partly rooted in the Christian commandment to love one’s neighbor. “Because I love my neighbors prior to June 14th I conducted a 2 year long undercover investigation,” he wrote.In messages published earlier by the New York Post, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for Donald Trump, but he declined to elaborate.“There is little evidence showing why he turned to political violence and extremism,” the acting US attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson, told reporters last month. He also reiterated that prosecutors consider Hortman’s killing a “political assassination”.Prosecutors say Boelter was disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car early on 14 June when he went to the Hoffmans’ home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin. He shot the senator nine times and his wife eight times, officials said.Boelter later went to the Hortmans’ home in nearby Brooklyn Park and killed both of them, authorities said.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaGun crimeUS politicsUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, saidearlier this yearthat she had directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty.“Like millions around the world, Vicky and I were riveted by coverage of the five-day manhunt from Midtown Manhattan to Altoona, Pennsylvania,” Patterson said. Mangione was eventually arrested in a McDonald’s.“This story touches all of us,” said Ward. “It goes to the heart of the social, cultural and political issues dividing the US right now. Nothing is more of a reviled black box than the health insurance industry, and it’s time to open it up, through a crime that has caught the attention of the country.”The book will be published by Little, Brown in the US, which also published The Idaho Four, Patterson and Ward’srecent bookon the murder of four students.View image in fullscreen‘More people reached out about this exact thing than anything else that has ever happened’ … Dave Franco in July.Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/ReutersThe news comes in the same week that Franco said he would be open to playing Mangione in a biopicwhen askedon the talkshow Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Tuesday. “No one has approached me about it yet, I’ll say that … More people in my life reached out about this exact thing than anything else that has ever happened.

I believe it’s a song that is going to resonate with a lot of people, because whether we like it or not, most of us are going to end up outliving our parents.

Well, you know, my dad always instilled in us the idea that honesty is the best policy! That you have to go through life being as truthful as possible and to always try to show integrity in your character. I remember mom was always big on us truly being brothers and looking out for one another, no matter what. That advice still resonates to this day and with the energy of this album.How did you guysdevelop your signature diction and wit as writers?MaximFlathPusha T: To me the most gangster shit in the world is when you’re having a really cutting conversation and looking directly into someone’s eyes. To be able to embody a coldness without being over the top. Like Tony Soprano might smack somebody up, but the most gangster part is when he’s just lucidly speaking to his therapist, you know? My rapping style is a lot like that.Thomas Hobbs: What about horror? Because you often sound like a horror bogeyman when you are rapping.Pusha T:I always liked the energy of the old horror movies. Like The Omen and The Exorcist, where a lot of it is based on these eerie conversations and they didn’t need special effects [to scare you].TH: Would you say coming from a musical household was a big part of shaping your style as well?Malice: Remember the movie Crooklyn by Spike Lee? The scene where all the brothers and sisters are watching Soul Train and American Bandstand? That was the perfect depiction of how musical our household was. By the time we moved to Virginia, I told my mom I wanted a microphone, a beat machine, a turntable, a Gemini mixer with the reverb on it. My mom literally forced my dad to buy it all for me, because he was much more dismissive at first and said things like: “Why do you need all that?Rapain’t even gonna be here for that long, son!” Music was always a big part of our upbringing. If I just think about our house then the living room was filled with hundreds of vinyl records from all genres. That was the foundation. You know that I recently found all those records and got them back?Pusha T: No, I didn’t know that.View image in fullscreenClipse in 2003.Photograph: Gregory Bojorquez/Getty ImagesMalice:It was literally tons of vinyl. Look: if my parents would argue, someone would go downstairs and put a record on full volume to drown out the noise. Music was always the backdrop and there tended to be cousins dancing in our house.Malice,you are a man of God and so am I; I’m a woman, actually.I love hip-hop, but sometimes the lyrics, imagery and messaging feels so spiritually off. How do you navigate that as a Christian?LoveFromLagosMalice: The gospel tells us about the war between the spirit and the flesh. It talks about these constant contradictions, and how helpless we all are as long as we are in this flesh. The flesh and the spirit are always at enmity with one another. So, we are all walking contradictions, right? The thing about morality is that you’re only good until you’re not. It’s not supposed to be a juggling act: we all try to do the right thing, but there’s going to be circumstances where we fall short. There is part of the scripture from the apostle Paul, who says: “For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do – this I keep on doing. Who will rescue me from this body of death?” It shows that we are all sinners and we all fall short. That’s what being human is all about.View image in fullscreen‘If I diss someone, it’s a very real thing to me’ … Clipse at the BET Hip Hop awards in 2022.Photograph: Terence Rushin/Getty ImagesAnd Pusha, you’ve been very candid abouthow things ended with Kanye’s GOOD Music label. While I understand you went through a lot of challenges, can you mention some of the good times?LovefromLagosPusha T: Just as a rap aficionado, well, being there was special! Creating So Appalled and New God Flow were some of my favourite memories. The Good Friday series, that was crazy, too. The albums I dropped during that time, like Daytona and It’s Almost Dry, they are very, very strong offerings. It goes without saying that me and Ye made great things together.Do you think there’ll ever be another collab between you and Ye?JooooooojPusha T: Yeah, that’s in the past. That’s definitely in the past.TH: But if one of your rap enemies ever apologised, could you let it go?Pusha T: I’m not mad at anybody. I’m good. I’m happy. But at the same time I don’t know if I necessarily want to work with those people either. I’m cool with how all of this has played out. If I diss someone it’s a very real thing to me. Like I watch rappers uses disses as a gimmick and shit like that, but that ain’t what it is for me.There is always a lot of humour and brilliant scene setting in your lyrics. Have you ever thought about writing a screenplay?HhhhssssMalice: Writing a screenplay for aClipsebiopic movie is a must. A lot of people would like to see that film. Right now, we’re seeing rappers fall to the federal government or they’re losing their lives because of drug addictions and out-of-control egos. But there’s a lot to learn from our lives, especially the way me and my brother have navigated the pitfalls of the business and always tried to make the best possible decisions.View image in fullscreen‘We always tried to make the best possible decisions’ … Pusha T(left), Pharrell Williams and Malice.Photograph: KMazur/WireImageWho had the best verse onLet God Sort Em Out?BezosofthenasalsPusha T: I don’t know if I have a personal favourite verse on the album to be honest, maybe it’s my Ace Trumpets verse. I wish I had rapped what Malice said on Mike Tyson Blow to the Face:“Only 300 bricks can make you Leonidas.”Pusha, I think I saw you performing with Kelis when she supported U2 in 2001. What was your experience of those shows?SharmadelicaPusha T: U2 were so fucking cool, man! I remember it was a super big deal to be touring with them at that time, and it was one of my first real experiences on a big stage. For U2, tour life is about five-star catering; runners who will go grab you whatever you ask for; and random vans that will take you anywhere in the city. These dudes had manicures, pedicures, massages! Touring with U2 seriously fucked up my expectations, bro. Because when you go out and tour for real as a rapper, the reality can be a very gruelling thing.Malice: Wait, hold up, can I share my own Bono interaction? I met him backstage around the time I converted from Malice to No Malice and found God. I remember Bono said to me: “You have this righteous anger now and you have to go do something with it!” That always stuck with me. It kind of gave me the green light, and what Bono said is always in the back of my mind around not abandoning my convictions. Bono is a good dude.What are each of your favourite albums of all time?FionnmckMalice: Listen, I love the Killers, I love Red Hot Chili Peppers, even Billy Joel! When I work out in the gym, I have Coldplay playing, or U2’s The Joshua Tree. It’s funny, because when I watched MTV back in the 1980s, David Bowie was always on there. All these years later and Bowie is still at the forefront today. I think that says something about true talent and how it can carry on through the ages. It even outlasts your death.Pusha T:I’m always torn between Mobb Deep’s The Infamous, Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Jay-Z’s Reasonable Doubt, and Biggie’s Life After Death. I can drive anywhere in the world with those four albums and I will be happy.View image in fullscreen‘We’ve definitely got more music in store’ … Clipse in 2007.Have you watched much British TV/film? If so, what have you liked and why?Jajones7Pusha T: [Loud laughter] Definitely Benny Hill! Benny was running around with women on late night TV! My older brother was always watching him, laughing, and I would sneak in. And what’s my other man called … um,Rowan Atkinson? Mr Bean, right? That dude was ill.Do you still write your rhymes? If so, do you prefer handwritten, typing on the phone, or both? Do you have any particular rituals when writing or recording?WzrdwthwrzfMalice: For me it’s about building a verse line-by-line throughout the day. It might start off in the shower, continue while I am driving, and then when I get to the studio I put it all together. It is always pen and paper with a pristine notebook. If I mess up on the writing, I am gonna rip out the page and start over.Pusha T: I can only write things down to be honest, because I am a very visual person. I don’t know how to do the whole spontaneous freestyle thing, because I am always second guessing myself. I am a perfectionist and so that involves editing a lot. I might come up with a good bar, but I will keep going back to it and working out how to make it fresher.What can we expect from the duo in the future? Is this the end?CClarke2005Pusha T: We’ve definitely got more music in store, baby.Malice: [Laughs knowingly] Nah, we got it. We’ve definitely got it!Let Got Sort Em Out is out now on Roc Nation.

Perhaps that earlier version had more to say about how the Clash came raging out of London’s punk scene in the 1970s; this one only really gets going in 1982 when Joe Strummer boots drummer Topper Headon out of the band for heroin addiction, then a year later kicks out guitarist Mick Jones. Rise and Fall Redux is a portrait of the band as a sinking ship, finally disbanding in 1986.It is a film groaning with talking heads. Pick of them is Viv Albertine of the Slits who sums the Clash up nicely when she says: “They were best when they were small and angry … when they were hard and angry and poor.” Others indulge in a bit intellectual waffle. The only member of the classic lineup to appear is guitarist Mick Jones, not taking it too seriously. Asked about the secret of the band’s success, he grins slyly: “It was a mix of luck and fortunate timing.” There are interviews too with the disgruntled drummers and guitarists hired in later years to replace Headon and Jones, poorly paid and seemingly badly treated by the band’s svengali-like manager Bernard Rhodes.In the end this a film for Clash fans, with little in the way of explainers; there’s not much, for example, about where the band came from or what it was like in the early days. There’s no recap of the stories about how Strummer met Jones and bassist Paul Simonon in a London dole queue, or how they were so frequently spat at on stage that in 1978 Joe Strummer contracted hepatitis from an audience member. It would benefit from a little more of the glory days, a little rise with the fall.The Rise and Fall of the Clash Redux is in UK cinemas from 8 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmMusic documentaryThe ClashDocumentary filmsPunkPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

They explain how queerness, neurodivergence and anti-colonialism guide what they doThu 7 Aug 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShare‘It’s often dealing with quite elemental things,” says the vocalist Gwretsien Ferch Lisbeth of Tristwch y Fenywod’s music. “The sense of being in an ancient landscape; or the enchanted, sapphic feeling of being by the ocean. Our music addresses things that are simple and foundational, but very powerful.”Released last August – and now being performed live by the band across the summer festival circuit – the trio’s self-titled debut album is a lush, cathartic mix of gothic instrumentation and eldritch melody, like a lost Cocteau Twins masterpiece recorded in a cave in Eryri, stirring intense feelings even in those who can’t understand its Welsh lyrics. There’s a political dimension too. “The oppression of the Welsh language over the past 200 years was so aggressive,” says the drummer Leila Lygad, citing how Welsh children were forced to speak English in 19th- and 20th-century schools. “It feels important to champion languages that have been oppressed by colonial systems.”Formed in Leeds by members of the underground groups Guttersnipe, Hawthonn and the Courtneys, and using Welsh pseudonyms for the project, Tristwch y Fenywod tap into a particularly Welsh mysticism. Ferch Lisbeth was born in Bangor, and lived in NorthWalesuntil the age of 12. “I always found it to be a very mystical place,” she says. “The language was definitely part of that, although we were in the minority of not being a Welsh-speaking family.”Maybe no one’s ever written songs in Welsh from these perspectives, and it’s about time they existedGwretsien Ferch LisbethBefore living in Leeds, Lygad grew up on the nearby Staffordshire-Shropshire border, and spent her childhood “walking on Penmaenmawr mountain” – on the North Wales coast – “and visiting the first stone circle I’d ever been to”, which sparked “a lifetime interest in archaeology, history and Welsh culture”.Ferch Lisbeth’s family moved her to England aged 12, but the landscape and language of Wales stayed in her subconscious. In 2020, after discovering a friend on the Leeds experimental music scene was a fluent speaker, she dedicated herself to learning Welsh “obsessively, every minute of every day”. She’d also started to date the band’s third member, the Canadian bassist Sidni Sarffwraig, and the pair visited North Wales together. “Having this beautiful sapphic connection in those places felt profound,” says Ferch Lisbeth. “It was some logical arrival of fate for me; different threads of the psyche converging.”View image in fullscreen‘For neurodivergent people, experimental music is a space to unmask’ … left to right: Leila Lygad, Gwretsien Ferch Lisbeth and Sidni Sarffwraig.When Tristwch y Fenywod formed in 2022, Ferch Lisbeth was driven to sing in Welsh about queerness, mysticism and belonging, because “maybe no one’s ever written a song in Welsh from this perspective, and it’s about time it existed.” Their band name translates to “the sadness of women”, and they are inspired by the “stately, elegant, feminine sadness” of groups such as Dead Can Dance.They also embrace the experimental amateurism of the 1970s no wave scene. Lygad plays electronic drums, programmed with unconventional sounds from field recordings. Her snare is a recording of a snapping toy from a joke shop she exploded in an underground bunker, while her toms are the clicks made by echolocating bats, a particularly goth detail of her set-up. Sarffwraig plays a standard bass guitar, but Ferch Lisbeth plays a self-made instrument she calls adwydelyn– Welsh for “two-harp” – constructed from two zithers and a contact mic: “I was thinking about Celtic harp music, and the first Dead Can Dance record where Lisa Gerrard is playing theyangqin[a Chinese dulcimer].”The three of them talk admiringly about the adventurous atmosphere they’ve cultivated within the band, and that’s echoed in the Leeds scene that nurtured them. At the centre isWharf Chambers, an accessible, co-op-run venue where, according to Ferch Lisbeth, “honesty is rewarded and genuineness of expression is the goal”. This is especially crucial for a band who are all neurodivergent. “For neurodivergent people, experimental music is a space to unmask and be publicly witnessed experiencing intense emotions,” says Sarffwraig. “The scene around Wharf Chambers gave us space to do something weird in a language people don’t understand. DIY venues have to be protected because they’re so important for experimentation.”The band have found a similarly supportive second home in North Wales, in a community of alternative Welsh and Welsh-language musicians such asAnxiolytics,Sister WivesandCerys Hafanathat has “a very wholesome, casual inclusion of queer, trans and neurodivergent people”, according to Ferch Lisbeth. Established Welsh musicians have shown support, including Datblygu and the Super Furry Animals producer Gorwel Owen, members of Fflaps, and the singerGwenno, who has recorded albums in Welsh and Cornish. “Gwenno is a very important figure,” says Lygad. “She’s championing minority languages and is an outspoken anti-capitalist and anti-colonialist.”There’s a way of respecting the past and tradition without the politics of nationalist ideasSidni SarffwraigOutside of Wales, Tristwch y Fenywod have a kinship with groups such as Kneecap and Lankum, who share their anti-colonial approach to language and folk tradition. “It’s been lovely seeing Kneecap have success with the Irish language and take it to the mainstream, because that’s where it should be,” says Lygad.The band hope their music inspires people to learn Welsh, or other minority languages, for pleasure and resistance. “People talk about wanting large-scale systemic change, but they’re still using the [English] language of laws and power structures,” says Ferch Lisbeth, who sees every language as “a different system of perception”. They also model a radical connection with history and heritage. “There’s a way of respecting the past and tradition without the politics of nationalist ideas,” says Sarffwraig. “Welsh is ancient, and allows you to connect with the way people were living a really long time ago. It’s unfair that people with conservative politics get to have a monopoly on that culture and history. We’re resisting that.”Tristwch y Fenywod play Green Man festival in Bannau Brycheiniog, Wales on 14 August;Big City festival in Glasgow on 16 August;Ara Deg festival in Bethesda, Wales on 13 September;Le Guess Who? festival in Utrecht, the Netherlands on 8 November; andSt Matthias Church, London on 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsPop and rockExperimental musicWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Although the songs are hedonistic – largely oscillating between wry flexes of wealth and lyrics about trifling with, and being trifled by, women in her orbit – she is also a realist: actions have consequences in Amaarae’s world, such as on Reckless & Sweet, as she wonders whether her lovers desire her or merely her money.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Amaarae album Black Star.Despite the ingenuity and complexity of her music,Amaaraehas struggled to break into the mainstream, in the UK at least. A recent Glastonbury set felt sparsely attended and, aside from 2020’s Sad Girlz Luv Money, one of the most enduring viral hits to emerge from TikTok into the real world, few of her singles have had crossover moments.Hopefully that will change with Black Star, her sleek and hugely enjoyable third album. It requires a slight resetting of expectations. After the plainly radical Fountain Baby, perhaps Amaarae would become downright experimental, but Black Star makes it clear that she just wants to have fun. This is her take on a club record, weaving elements of house, trance and EDM into Afrobeats rhythms and spiky rap cadences. It’s more straightforward than its predecessor, but that doesn’t diminish its pleasure, derived in large part from Amaarae’s relentless pursuit of just that: these songs exalt drinking, drug‑taking, rowdy sex and fine dressing in such a clarified, unapologetic way that they would elicit blushes even fromthe Weeknd, pop’s reigning king of smut.You can imagine Amaarae’s bass-heavy but elegant music soundtracking a dark, exclusive superclub, a fitting mode for a musician who prioritises opulence and indulgence in her music. Starkilla, a collaboration with the London rapper Bree Runway, is a villainous-sounding house track the hook of which is simply “ketamine, coke and molly” over and over again; the slick crush-object song B2B combines pulsating electro with the euphoric chug of South African amapiano. There is a remarkable amount of other dance styles explored here: high-speed dembow and baile funk animate Girlie-Pop!; there are elements of Detroit techno and gqom, another South African style, on SMO; and the opener, Stuck Up, features raucous club rap. Even if it’s a more traditional record overall, her globalist attitude makes for sparky, cosmopolitan music.The focus of Amaarae’s lyrics hasn’t changed significantly, although Black Star is a softer and more lovestruck album than its predecessor. On Kiss Me Thru the Phone Pt 2, a PinkPantheress-featuring sequel to the Soulja Boy original, Amaarae and PinkPantheress sing sweetly about “yearning for you to the bone”, their twinned helium voices sounding surprisingly great together. Fineshyt, the best song here, is a gentle trance track that captures the innate sense of melancholy in the much-maligned genre, Amaarae singing about wanting to try a real relationship with her object of affection. These songs provide a welcome counterpoint to the abrasive posturing of earlier ones, which have Amaarae and guests – including Naomi Campbell – mugging and boasting to admittedly great effect.Campbell’s appearance is eyebrow-raising: “They call me a bitch, a villain, controversial diva – no, I am the black star,” she intones, which will probably inflame the many people still up in arms over Campbell’s misdeeds, ranging from assault convictions to thealleged mismanagement of a charity(which she denies). But it’s fitting for an album that is deliriously in love with wealth, celebrity and all the power it affords. There is a difference between Amaarae and all the other stars fixated on such topics: for her, glamour is a side quest and love is the motive. Shopping at Saks and being passed another blunt might be nice, Amaarae seems to say, but the real high comes from finding someone to share it with.This week Shaad listened toWild Pink and Fenne Lily: Disintegrate – EditWild Pink’s John Ross is one of the best lyricists in indie music.

In that process of recognition Grime’s smaller-scale works have received relatively little attention, but as this collection of seven recordings from the Hebrides Ensemble shows, the same qualities that characterise her largest orchestral canvases distinguish her work on the smallest scale too.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Helen Grime: Chamber Music.Photograph: DelphianThe pieces here, composed between 2004 and 2016, range from a string sextet to a work for two horns, and Grime’s fastidious ear to colour and texture is evident in all the instrumental combinations. Several of the pieces take their inspiration from nature and landscape, though the sextet, Into the Faded Air, borrows its title from TS Eliot’s Four Quartets;Ted Hughes’s poetry lies behind the trio Snow and Snow, while the starting point for the crisp, vivid Seven Pierrot Miniatures, composed for the same instrumental lineup as Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, is obvious enough. But as all the Hebrides’ performances demonstrate, this music can communicate even without any of its external references.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

So much so that in the late 1960s bothJimmy PageandRitchie Blackmore, the respective guitarists and leaders of the heavy rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, approached him to front their groups. That Reid, who has died of cancer aged 75, turned them both down, could have reduced him to a footnote in rock history, yet his singular talent continued to be recognised by musicians fromAretha Franklinto Dr Dre.Reid’s lack of chart success – he would only release six studio albums in a career that spanned almost 60 years – should not detract from his achievements: alongside his powerful voice (his nickname was “Superlungs”), he was also a gifted guitarist and songwriter, while two of his albums, River (1973) and Seed of Memory (1976), would achieve retrospective critical acclaim and find, once reissued, a far wider audience than when first released.Reid was also a valued collaborator: he performed and/or recorded with musicians from the Brazilian vocalistGilberto Gil, through the Californian singer-songwritersJackson BrowneandBonnie Raitt, to the rap producerDr Dre. When declining Page, Reid recommended he seek outRobert Plant, a teenage vocalist that he had encountered in the Midlands, and his band’s drummer,John Bonham, and thus Led Zeppelin was born. “It’s good to check your ego and support other artists’ visions,”Reid told the Guardian in 2024, adding, “I’m part of a society of musicians and I love that I can go out there and sing.”Born in Little Paxton, Cambridgeshire, to Grace (nee Barber) and Walter Reid, Terry was raised in the village of Bluntisham. Walter owned a tractor dealership while Grace managed a small orchard that grew apples for cider. Reid recalled that his mother would stand him on a crate so that he could sing to the women she worked alongside during the apple harvest. Attending St Ivo school in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, Reid formed the Redbeats with schoolmates, and regularly played local venues.One evening in 1965 at the Palais in Peterborough, the Redbeats supported Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers, an instrumental rock band. Jay was so impressed by the 15-year-old Terry that he approached his father to ask if he could join the Jaywalkers as vocalist. Parental permission granted, Reid left school and relocated with the Jaywalkers to London.He then underwent an intensive apprenticeship singing R&B hits in pubs and clubs across Britain.Keith RichardsandMick Jaggerwitnessed a performance at the Marquee club in 1966 and invited the Jaywalkers to join the Rolling Stones’ UK tour alongsideIkeandTina Turnerand the Yardbirds, featuring Page, who would later invite Reid to join his new band. Reid, however – with shout-outs from Franklin, who told the press on a 1968 visit to the UK that “there are only three things happening in England: the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Terry Reid” – was determined to go solo. The same year,Mickie Most,then one of Britain’s most successful pop producers, signed him.View image in fullscreenReid at the Glastonbury festival in 2009.Photograph: Hayley Madden/RedfernsWhile Most had launched such acts as Donovan and the Animals, he and Reid failed to gel; Reid’s somewhat overwrought vocals on his 1968 debut album, Bang, Bang You’re Terry Reid, met with public indifference. In 1969, after recording his eponymous second album, Reid was again invited by the Stones to join them on tour, this time across the US. Before the tour, however, he fell out irreparably with Most, yet found himself locked into a recording contract. The album was stronger than Reid’s debut, but Most declined to promote it.Reid relocated to California and continued to tour, performing at Glastonbury festival in 1971 (so appearing in Glastonbury Fayre, a feature documentary co-directed byNicolas Roeg), while litigation with Most continued. Atlantic Records finally resolved the dispute and signed Reid, releasing his 1973 album River. A beautifully meandering blend of rock, folk, blues, jazz and bossa nova that baffled many (including Atlantic) when initially released – its abstract textures did not attract radio play – it was appreciated by a new audience on its reissue in the early 2000s. Similarly Seed of Memory, on ABC, and produced by Reid’s friendGraham Nash, failed to reach listeners at the time, despite following more conventional song structures.On Rogue Waves (1978), Reid performed uninspired rock versions of 60s-era pop hits and pleased no one. He retreated to working as a session musician, returning for the 1991 album The Driver. With a bombastic production by Trevor Horn, Reid appeared adrift on his own album.Reid sat out much of the 90s until a Monday night residency at a Beverly Hills bar became a magnet for his fans – one of whom, Thomas Brooman, director ofWomad festival, invited Reid to perform at the 2002 event. Chris Johnson, a film producer who had licensed one of Reid’s songs for the1999 British feature The Criminal, organised some more UK dates, and Reid began regularly performing on this side of the Atlantic, returning to Womad and Glastonbury festivals alongside summer tours and residencies at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. This led to the 2012 Live In London album, his final release.The reissues of River and Seed of Memory brought renewed media attention and approaches from younger musicians such as Alabama 3 and DJ Shadow. His songs also began to be placed in Hollywood films, while the actor Johnny Depp funded new recordings by Reid (so far unreleased). A UK tour for this September was cancelled after Reid was diagnosed with cancer in June.A 1976 marriage to Susan Johnson ended in divorce in 1982. Reid is survived by his second wife, Annette (nee Grady), whom he married in 2004, and two daughters, Kelly and Holly, from a previous relationship.Terry (Terrance James) Reid, singer, guitarist and songwriter, born 13 November 1949; died 4 August 2025Explore more on these topicsBluesPop and rockobituariesShareReuse this content"

But who was he really working for?John BanvilleThu 7 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 05.31 EDTShareSome years ago, a colleague on the Irish Times took the columnist Nuala O’Faolain to lunch. Nuala was famous, and feared, as a controversialist who specialised in attacking popular pieties, unless it was the pietests who were under attack, in which case she would spring immediately to their defence.The pair had hardly finished their starters when the colleague, who had been in newspapers long enough to know better, heard himself asking Nuala how she managed to have so many opinions, enough to fill 52 columns yearly, as well as the odd special assignment. Nuala, cutlery suspended in mid-air, looked at him incredulously and said: “What are you talking about? I haven’t any opinions – I’m a journalist.”Richard Evans, although a former newsman himself, does not seem to have grasped the first commandment in the journalist’s catechism: stop at nothing in pursuit of a story. His subject, George Ward Price, certainly adhered to it. Dubbed by Ernest Hemingway “the Monocled Prince of the Press”, he was one of the most successful and most famous journalists of his time. Born in 1886, the son of a clergyman, he lived for 75 years, and died largely forgotten but extremely rich, leaving more than £125,000 in his will, “at a time when”, Evans writes, “the average annual UK salary was around £1,000”.When Ward Price was at school, a friend said of him that his ambition was to be either “a bishop, or on the staff of the Daily Mail”. He hearkened to the latter calling, and quickly became the Mail’s star journo, producing scoop after scoop and leaving the competition stumbling in his wake. His greatest triumphs came in the 1930s, when he courted the Nazis zealously, in particular Hitler, who in Linz, on the evening after the German annexation of Austria, “greeted him with a smile. ‘Well, Ward Price,’ he said. ‘Always there!’”Ward Price’s reporting came in for serious criticism, including from Winston Churchill, who declared on meeting him: “I see that you’ve been over in Germany again, shaking the bloodstained hands of your Nazi friends.” In his autobiography, Extra-Special Correspondent, published in 1957, Ward Price claimed that he “reported his [Hitler’s] statements accurately, leaving British newspaper readers to form their own opinion of their worth”. For other commentators, he was merely the “international mouthpiece for the Duce and for the Führer”.In any case, early on in his book, Evans produces a piece of evidence that, taken at face value, unequivocally condemns the Mail’s preeminent reporter. Six months after the Anschluss, and following Neville Chamberlain’s peace mission to Germany, Ward Price spent some days at Hitler’s holiday retreat in the Bavarian Alps. Here he had exclusive access to the Nazi leader in all his moods, from the avuncular to the manic. At the end of his stay, as Evans writes, Ward Price “came down from the mountain with the biggest story in the world”.That story was of Hitler’s determination to take over the Czech Sudetenland, and by implication, his plans for further, wider conquests. However, the piece that appeared in the Mail seems to have been a tempered version of what Ward Price had written. And who did the tempering? Joseph Goebbels, who was at Berchtesgaden at the time, wrote in his diary: “He [Hitler] is still revising the interview by Ward Price, which has turned out very well. It was somewhat too effusive.”Evans makes surprisingly little of this explosive snippet, yet it is the smoking gun at the heart of his book. If Ward Price did allow Hitler to tone down what he had recorded, it would have been a total betrayal of himself as a journalist. Securing the “biggest story in the world” was possible only through an extraordinary act of malpractice. It is one thing to tell yourself you have no opinions, are merely an accurate chronicler – it is quite another to permit your subject to burnish his own image. When your subject is Hitler, it is wickedness itself.Interviewing Hitler: How George Ward Price Became the World’s Most Famous Journalist by Richard Evans is published by The History Press (£22).

There’s no better Indian ruin than Kolkata, a city that still clings to the centrality of its role in the 19th-century intellectual renaissance that buttressed the case for Indian self-rule. The adage back then was that “what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow”.Great Eastern Hotel, the second novel from the author of The Last Jet-Engine Laugh, is 920 pages and well over 300,000 words long. The staff of your local Waterstones will kindly describe it as “an undertaking”. It is set in and around the still-standing, now eye-wateringly expensive Great Eastern Hotel, which is, as the book points out, a model for the city itself: a place that was once the confluence for an entire subcontinent, where conquerors and subjugated, foreigners and natives met and danced and governed and suffered. When the book opens in 1941, instead of today’s sunburnt German tourists, we have whisky, secret societies, spies, anti-colonial firebrands and over-rouged raciness, with the hotel as the stage on and around which the characters play out their political struggles, love lives and artistic endeavours.I’ve not read a book by an author this year who so clearly loves what he’s writing aboutThe book revolves around young communist revolutionary Nirupama, whose ill-fated romance with an African American soldier leaves her with a semi-orphan son, Saki (named after the freshly Oppenheimered city). He is our future narrator, assembling history out of scraps of memories, inventions and outright fabrications. The narrative combines the story of her political and emotional development in the chaos of the Japanese yomp through south-east Asia, filtered through that of her son in the years after Indian independence as he struggles to find his voice as an artist, stuck between the two worlds of his parental inheritance. There are a host of other characters – confused apple-cheeked young bluestocking Imogen, gin-soaked upper-crust intellectual artist Kedar, pickpocket turned hidden market impresario Gopal and many other Indians, British, Americans and French of varying political and alcoholic affiliations.The communists did end up winning, of course, for a while, ruling West Bengal as the longest democratically elected communist government in the world. They even ran the titular hotel as a state enterprise for 30 long, mouldy, complaint-stacked, orgiastically corrupt years, before it was mercilessly or mercifully privatised to resounding success, sold off in the 2000s by the last stuttering communists, lacking fluency in India’s modern electoral language of multi-ethnic sectarian clientelism. They were the ones who changed the city’s name to Kolkata, a wan attempt to appeal to Bengali linguistic nationalism, but it wasn’t enough – it never is.The hotel isn’t as central to the plot as it was to that other great novel about Calcutta hotel intrigues, Sankar’s Chowringhee, with its glamour, gossip and Grand Hotel rococo raffishness, and there’s none of the densely plotted balletic regimentation of Amor Towles’s hotel-bound A Gentleman in Moscow. What we have instead is a panoramic view of second world war-era Calcutta, with alcoholic artists, rambunctious chefs, wily servants, plotting communists, smoky jazz bars, rattan chairs and indolent ceiling fans. The Bengal famine lurks in the background, rural peasants slowly stumbling into the big city, “skeletons whispering in dialects we rarely heard in Calcutta”, first a trickle, then a flood. The hotel isn’t just a model of the city by the end, it is “alive and constantly moving across the planet, sliding from Bengal to Biafra to Cambodia and then back to Bengal, and then going god knows where else” – a metaphor for the horrible glamour of life and death, feast and famine, stalking the 20th and 21st centuries.Joshi has a vast canvas to play with here, and it’s heady, sensually described, deeply felt stuff. He has a gift for evocative, Technicolor phrases. Doors are “like two lovers parting in a puppet opera”, the British are “dried‑up rinds of lime in the evaporated gin and tonic of your Empire”,a character’s eyebrows are Molotov and Ribbentrop. There’s a slight relentlessness to the English and Banglish wordplay – a “be-mansioned and be-knighted” character and his employee are “Sir and Sir-vant” – with nicknames and political in-jokes aplenty.Despite its panoramic approach, the novel does often stray into the hotel genre’s greatest pitfall, familiar to anyone who ever opened a doorstopper from its 70s maximalist heyday, wherein characters become types, mere bits of stage scenery to take us places and deliver lines: the naive young British woman, the outrageously plucky street thief, the unscrupulous proto-Greene American eyeing the rotting carcass of empire. There’s a sometimes cloying tendency by the protagonist-narrator to announce themselves as “an architect-engineer” constructing a “story-hotel” “room by room”, and that there is “no way that I … could have forged a proper narrative, but it was useful to try”. These retrospective passages, narrated by Saki from his abortive career as an architectural historian in 1970s Paris, are the novel’s weakest – too knowing, too wry, too pat.But Joshi’s ability to render place and time is truly first-rate. I’ve not read a book by an author this year who so clearly loves what he’s writing about. There’s an absurd combination of fun and wonder and horror on every page. We can only hope that having taken 25 years to write his second novel, he’ll be back sooner with his next.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Bernband is “a sci-fi exploration game for people who like to wander…”. Players will be able to simply walk around a colourful and unusual world, wandering in the glow cast by streetlights and ducking beneath zigzagging overhead flags. They’ll tour hallways where strange green life grows politely in planters, and they’ll even get the chance to snooze on rattling otherworldly subway trains while hand grips – tentacle grips? – jiggle as they hang overhead. “There’s no goal but to stroll,” the game’s Steam page promises. “Where will your feet take you?”There’s something intoxicating about a game that just lets you wander. But it doesn’t mean the game itself is easy to make, of course. “Wandering [as] the main goal is quite difficult for many reasons,” says Tom van den Boogaart, the developer of Bernband, who is using the project to reimagine a much smaller version he made in 2014. “To let players explore on their own, I think you first of all need to give them some context, such as where they are and what kind of world they are exploring.”View image in fullscreen‘Exploration is the main goal’ … Bernband.Photograph: Sokpop CollectiveAs a result, every wander through Bernband begins in the same way: in a small apartment with a window that offers a glimpse of the strange universe the game inhabits. “The idea is to communicate that you are someone who’s living in this city,” Van den Boogaart says. “And that over time it will start to feel familiar. It’s clear that your journey starts when you walk out of there through the door.” The apartment also serves as a place that players can return to after exploring the city. “It creates the minor goal of, ‘can I find my way back to my apartment?’. Perhaps even if it’s just something subconscious.”Van den Boogart quickly learned that a wandering game also needs to give players a number of places to head for at any time. As a result, most of the world of Bernband is set up in a nonlinear manner. “Most of the time there are multiple ways to reach a location,” he says, “of which some are a bit more hidden or obscure than others. When exploration is the main goal of the game, you want to give players the choice of what to explore. Even if it’s as simple as going left or right at a crossing.”View image in fullscreenAn alien city inspired by real-life places … Bernband.Photograph: Sokpop CollectiveWith a design this unobtrusive, Van den Boogaart admits it’s been a constant battle not to gamify things a little, whether that’s adding a map that shows players places they’ve already been to or a checklist for them to complete as they walk. He has resisted, however. “I believe that having access to information like this takes away the magical feeling of stumbling upon a secret area,” he laughs. “You would already in some way know that it exists.”Bernband’s alien city is not a traditional open world, but instead consists of discrete areas that are linked by elevators and other transportation methods. The approach was chosen to allow players to focus completely on specific parts of a bigger place, all of which turn out to have their own personalities and flavours. In turn, Van den Boogaart works from a list of locations that he thinks would be fun or interesting. To keep himself creative, he ensures this list is fairly vague: big supermarket, shady bar, swimming pool with water slide.And while it’s an alien world, Bernband is inspired by places that Van den Boogaart knows in real life, whether that’s his home town of Gouda in the Netherlands or the places the games industry tends to orbit,such as Tokyo, San Francisco and Stockholm.“When making a game, I prefer to draw inspiration from personal memories and experiences instead of other media such as games or film,” he says. “It helps me to build a deeper and more personal connection with my work, and I hope that in the end this also gives the game and the world a unique feel.”Bernband is in development forPC, release date not yet confirmedExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s Lazarus he more resembles in this follow-up tolast year’s debut, which won Kent-Walters a best newcomer award. In Live!!!, the monstrous MC of a Rotherham working men’s club was dragged to hell after the expiry of his pact with Satan. In Dead!!!, he rises again, after a stint as entertainment officer in the underworld, to reclaim his club from a scarier foe than the devil himself: gentrification.That’s the premise for a show that doubles down on, rather than develops, the formula that hit paydirt for the Huddersfield man last summer. And why not? Kent-Walters has devised something outrageously funny and bizarre here, a charismatic ghoul of an alter ego, terrorising his audience with a series of crap cabaret acts, delivered in a voice as deep and gravelly as a quarry in the bowels of hell.

In fact, Earth (Danielle Steers) is a Bridget Jones style singleton who is 750m years into looking for love. She is not convinced when Humanity (Tobias Turley) comes along, all earnestness and cute lines (“You are the centre of my universe”) but is slowly won over.Somehow, Jack Godfrey and Ellie Coote’s climate romcom manages not to make a hot mess out of a very bizarre idea. Quite the opposite. It is so well executed that you see the tragedy of Earth’s love affair with Humanity as a toxic relationship in which the latter betrays, manipulates and gaslights, even as you are dazzled by the music, tickled by the humour and taken in by the romance.It is a two-hander in which both performers blaze. Steers is armed with an out-of-this-world voice and a welter of well-timed one-liners (“I can literally pull anyone, it’s called gravity” and “I’m not picky, I’m naturally selective”). Turley is a formidable singer, too, and manages his character’s trajectory from wet-eared eagerness to workaholism, insecurity, unfaithfulness and denial.View image in fullscreenSurprises and delights … Steers and Turley in Hot Mess.Photograph: Mark SeniorIt serves as a metaphor for our abuse of the planet’s resources while making promises to do better, and be greener – tomorrow. But it is delivered without flat-footedness or strain, never breaking out of the storyline of its central romance. You know where it is all heading but it still manages to surprise and delight.Coote’s book whops out one brilliant line after another. Godfrey’s lyrics keep up while the music is super catchy, whether synth pop, rock, funk or moments of rap. The duo’s Edinburgh fringe show last year,42 Balloons, was a runaway hit. This cements their extraordinary musical chemistry. Coote, who directs as well, keeps it pacy. Having played a run at the Birmingham Hippodrome earlier this year, the production is slick without being glib.A fringe highlight which, like the planet, deserves a longer, fuller life.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025MusicalsClimate crisisEdinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

For playwright Lyuba Ilnytska, it feels like an analogy for her native Ukraine under Russia’s unprovoked assault. Much as she would like a giant Pokémon bird to stand over Kharkiv, allowing its residents a peaceful night’s sleep, the reality is something more bleak. There is no escape from the terror.Working with choreographer Anatolii Sachivko from the city’sNafta theatre, performer and director Nina Khyzhna makes this theme concrete. As she presents it, the toll of life during wartime is not only psychological but also physical. Whether it is the bombardment of rockets and drones or the adjustment to prosthetics, air raid warnings and emergency Telegram groups, the impact hits the body.“Movement is a must for a human being” is a phrase repeated in a dance-theatre performance that articulates the unspeakable experience of living in sleepless fear.She dances, sometimes with small neurotic movements, a woman under pressure, other times with muscular fury, a victim fighting back, taking us through a theatrical poem that evokes the everyday oppression of war.View image in fullscreenA woman under pressure … Nina Khyzhna in Someone Like Me.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianBased on interviews with residents, old and young, Someone Like Me is a collage of voices, unrelated to each other but unified in the face of terror and speaking as one. A child on tiptoes plays a game of civilians and snipers; an old-timer recalls the great famine of the 1930s and previous military conflicts; a woman tries to reassure her mother they will be safe when she can scarcely persuade herself.Nik Akorn’s score clicks, rattles and unsettles, while Khyzhna moves with precision, mapping the streets of her beloved Kharkiv and embodying the trauma of her compatriots.

Solitude Without Loneliness can feel like several fringe shows in one as Malcolm Sutherland’s dance-theatre production takes an early detour into sketch comedy and then continues to change gears.As a choreographer, Sutherland is interested in the perks and perils of isolation and he forms a trio with Jorja Follina and Alex Henderson, who are all initially alone together. Against the stark towers cast by Simon Gane’s lighting design, the three writhe in a state of undress, faces covered by their clothing. It’s a straightforward yet surprisingly effective way to establish a piece about depersonalisation, matched by muffled voices on Hörður Már Bjarnason’s rumbling soundscape and muted costumes by Alison Brown.As the dancers leave their silos to come together, their soul-searching gazes matched to choral music, you brace yourself for an overearnest hour. But then the Blind Date theme tune breaks out, rose petals are scattered and the trio alternate the roles of a frisky French waiter and two diners who can’t bear to look at each other as they squirm around their seats. The knockabout wordplay aims to be as nimble as the movement, but the touches of clowning – including red lipstick served and smeared in lieu of wine – are more winning.View image in fullscreenFrisky waiter … Malcolm Sutherland, centre, in Solitude Without Loneliness.Photograph: PRThe alternately serio-comic nature of these two episodes – which are both overextended – is akin to channel-hopping, and the contrast diminishes the impact of each. But the remainder of the show reaps haunting results from unlikely sources. The first is a series of speeches akin to Metro’sRush Hour Crushcolumn, each a message in a bottle to a stranger after a brief encounter.These missed chances for connection have a sting here, as does a meta-theatrical flyering sequence that finds the desperate cast surrounded by adverts for their own show. It’s a spin on the scenes along the Grassmarket outside, with Sutherland cannily pinning all his themes – romance, disorientation, loneliness, togetherness – to the fringe itself.

So I don’t know.”He added: “I feel like we’re at this cusp in human development where you’ve got the three existential threats: climate and our overall degradation of the natural world, nuclear weapons, and super-intelligence.

Last September, he joined the board of directors of Stability AI and earlier this year said the future of blockbuster film-making hinges on being able to “cut the cost of [VFX] in half”.He clarified that he hoped such cost-cutting would come not from human layoffs but speed acceleration.However, Cameron has also expressed scepticism about the capacity of AI to replace screenwriters. In 2023, he said: “I just don’t personally believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said – about the life that they’ve had, about love, about lying, about fear, about mortality – and just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate it … I don’t believe that’s ever going to have something that’s going to move an audience.

You can feel Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s disdain in every frameZach VasquezThu 7 Aug 2025 06.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 12.35 EDTShareTwo weeks ago, South Park kicked off its 27th season with one of its angriest, most politically daring episodes. The animated sitcom, long a magnet for controversy, incurred the wrath of the current US administration for its brutal and graphic send-up ofDonald Trumpas a petty, micro-penised dictator, as well as parent company Paramount’s cowardly capitulations to him.Lewd, crude and politically astute: South Park’s history of controversyRead moreCreators Matt Stone and Trey Parker received immediate backlash not only from online conservative fans (who make up a good portion of their audience) but the White House itself, which released a statement callingSouth Parkhypocritical and irrelevant. That latter charge was especially poignant, given that Stone and Parker just inked a new deal with Paramount for five more seasons, plus streaming rights, to the tune of $1.5bn.Tensions have only risen in the two weeks since the premiere aired. During that time, the show released several stills from the follow-up episode, which widens its sights from Trump to his media mouthpieces and foot soldiers. Figures from both groups –rightwing activist Charlie Kirkand the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – boastfully shared these images on X, with the latter sarcastically thanking South Park for helping them in their recruiting efforts. (The show responded on X by asking DHS “Wait, so we ARE relevant? #eatabagofdicks”.)All of this is to say that the new episode, titled Got a Nut, is coming in hot. And for the most part, it lives up to the hype.The episode follows two different stories: in one, the show’s resident bigot, Eric Cartman, is outraged to learn that fellow fourth grader Clyde has risen to prominence as a white nationalist podcaster who makes offensive claims about women, Jewish people, Black people and other minority groups to goad them into debating him in exploitative viral videos (“WOKE STUDENT TOTALLY PWNED”). Of course, Cartman isn’t angry on behalf of any of those groups; he’s mad that Clyde is ripping off his gimmick and reaping all the rewards. He decides to muscle in on the act, styling his hair after Kirk’s signature coif (“the stupidest haircut I’ve ever seen,” says one character), trolling college girls on social media and proclaiming himself a “master-debater”.The other storyline sees South Park Elementary’s kindly counsellor Mr Mackey out of a job thanks to government budget cuts. Desperate to find a new way to “make his nut”, he reluctantly joins Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Alongside his fellow masked goons – a collection of inexperienced, illiterate miscreants – and under the leadership ofDHS secretary Kristi Noem, Mackey ends up taking part in violent raids at Dora the Explorer concerts and the literal gates of heaven, where he helps round up every Hispanic in sight (per Noem: “Only detain the brown ones! If it’s brown, it goes down!”).Both stories eventually intersect, as Clyde and Mackey are rewarded for their work with a trip to Mar-a-Lago. The country club is depicted as a gross, white trash version of bizarre 70s/80s US wish fulfilment drama Fantasy Island, with President Trump and vice-president JD Vance standing in forRicardo Montalbanand dwarf actor Herve Villechaize’s characters. Younger viewers may not get this reference, but they don’t need to: the visual of an ice-cream-suited Trump kicking around a dwarf version of Vance (his already big face puffed up to resemble the popular meme of him) is hilarious all on its own.Trump gets off easy here compared with Vance, but the show saves its harshest vitriol for Noem, who spends all her time viciously gunning down cute puppies (including the beloved Krypto from the new Superman movie) and struggling to keep her overly Botoxed face from melting off her skull. It’s a ruthless scouring of Noem, and you can feel Stone and Parker’s disdain for her in every frame.View image in fullscreenMasked goons galore in South Park Got a Nut.Photograph: ParamountAs per South Park tradition, the central characters come to realise the errors of their ways, with Mr Mackey delivering the episode’s moral straight down the lens: “If you’re doing something you don’t really believe in just to make your nut, you’re gonna find that you just get sadder and your nut just gets bigger, m’kay?”Herein lies the issue with the episode. Got a Nut posits that the individuals who serve as Trump’s most gung-ho operatives are acting entirely cynically, doing and saying things they know are wrong for an easy pay cheque. Certainly, that’s part of it (see the signing bonuses and sponsorship deals the episode highlights), but it is dangerous to underestimate how many of these people fully believe their own rhetoric.But of course, it would be silly to expect a half-hour episode of South Park to encapsulate every facet of Trump’s dystopia. Luckily, we’ve got plenty of episodes left to look forward to (48, minimum). Just as exciting will be the surefire backlash coming from Trump and his base, who are utterly incapable of not taking the bait.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionUS televisionAnimation on TVDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The crowd react orgiastically, and a nun “fondles the corpse’s visible erection”.Other signature Fennell shots include lingering takes of “suggestive textures” such as egg yolks, bread dough and slug trails.Test screenings offer production companies an early opportunity to gauge mainstream reactions to forthcoming releases. Studios show unfinished versions of films to the public, who usually promise confidentiality.The majority of final versions of movies differ from versions trialled in this way, with the endings of films a particularly common alteration. Films whose conclusions were changed following audience feedback include Titanic, 28 Days Later, Blade Runner, Pretty Woman and Sunset Boulevard.Earlier this year the film’s casting director, Kharmel Cochrane,defended her choicesafter many suggested Robbie was too old to play the role of Catherine Earnshaw, as well as questioning Elordi’s ethnicity, since Heathcliff, the foundling with whom she falls in love, is generally perceived to have a Romany or Gypsy background.Most big and small screen adaptations of the novel have ignored this, with the character having been played by actors including Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Timothy Dalton.Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptationcast a mixed race actor, James Howson, in the role.‘It’s just a book’: Wuthering Heights casting director defends choice of Margot Robbie and Jacob ElordiRead moreSpeaking at the Sands film festival in Scotland, Cochrane said there was “no need to be accurate” as the source material is “just a book”.She continued: “There’s definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy. Wait until you see the set design, because that is even more shocking. And there may or may not be a dog collar in it.”The film, which is scheduled for release on Valentine’s Day 2026, will be Robbie’s first major role since Barbie and Fennell’s first film since Saltburn became an audience sensation in 2023, although it underperformed with awards bodies.World of Reel quotes another attender of the Dallas screening as saying that despite strong leading performances, Fennell’s take on their characters is sufficiently “cold and unlikable” that engagement with their fates is made difficult.Explore more on these topicsFilmEmerald FennellEmily BrontënewsShareReuse this content"

As a retrospective opens in Oxford, he looks back on three decades with the bandThu 7 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTShareIn the early 90s, Stanley Donwood was “at a loose end after university”, hitching around Britain and making a little money as a busking fire-breather. Fetching up in Oxford, he spotted a poster for a gig by a band called On a Friday. He recognised the name: a friend he’d met while studying at Exeter University’s fine art department called Thom Yorke was the lead singer.So he called Yorke up. An initial plan for Donwood to do his fire-breathing routine as the band’s support act was scuppered by the venue’s nervous manager, but the pair kept in touch. Some time later, after On a Friday had changed their name toRadiohead, Yorke called with a proposition. “They’d done really well with Creep, which I hadn’t heard, it wasn’t my thing at all; I liked bleepy-bleepy, thumpy-thump music,” says Donwood. “But he said: ‘Our record sleeves are shit, do you want to come and have a go?’”Their collaboration began in a fairly inauspicious, on-the-hoof style. For the 1994 EP My Iron Lung, they came up with the idea of videoing an actual iron lung and using a still from the ensuing footage. But having managed to inveigle access to Oxford’s John Radcliffe hospital with a video camera, they discovered that an iron lung was just “a gunmetal grey box – kind of horrific, but aesthetically very boring”. On the plus side, while at the hospital, they spotted a resuscitation dummy: a grainy still from the video they made of it wound up on the cover of the 1995 album The Bends.Loads of times, I think I’ve run out of ideas. Then something happens and it’s like: Wow!Thus began a collaboration that’s lasted 31 years. Together, Donwood and Yorke have created the artwork for every Radiohead release since The Bends, as well as for Yorke’s various other projects – solo albums, Atoms for Peace and the Smile – and a series of books. Donwood has also staged solo exhibitions, published books, worked with author Robert Macfarlane and designed the posters for Glastonbury for more than 20 years. But there’s something particularly striking about his Radiohead-adjacent collaborations with Yorke, which are collected in a new exhibition at Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum, This Is What You Get, its title taken from the lyrics of the band’s 1997 single Karma Police. The show spans a vast variety of mediums – from computer art to collage to oils to linocut – but invariably captures the existential dread at the heart of Radiohead’s music.Their working practices are unorthodox. Donwood usually moves into the studio where Radiohead are recording – or a nearby building, with an audio link to the studio – and creates art in direct response to what they’re making. It is, by his own account, a nerve-racking experience. “Loads of times, I’ve found myself in these amazing places, with the brushes and the computer, everything I need, thinking: ‘This is terrible, I’ve got nothing. Maybe I’ve run out of ideas. I’m going to have to get a job.’ It’s quite depressing. And then something just sort of happens and it’s like ‘Wow!’”Yorke then adds to the work. Sometimes he deliberately obscures what Donwood has done, as was the case with the artwork for 1997’s OK Computer. Sometimes they paint on the same canvas simultaneously. “We used to compete to see who could finish [the artwork],” he says. “We’ve got a lot less competitive, it’s a lot more collaborative now. We’re just older, you know. More tired!”Everything in its right place: six works from the exhibitionView image in fullscreenStanley Donwood’s Snowfall on House, 1997.Photograph: Courtesy of Stanley DonwoodSnowfall on House, 1997“The figures and motorway from this OK Computer-era painting were blown-up photos Thom had taken on tour,” says Donwood. “And we had these textbooks from Oxfam. We scanned them, and were using this tablet whose stylus acted like an eraser – the rubbing out was really thin, not very good. When you cover up your mistakes in real life, you’re never very good at it, so we wanted the mistakes to still be there.”View image in fullscreenStanley Donwood’s Get Out Before Saturday, 2000.Photograph: Courtesy of Stanley DonwoodGet Out Before Saturday, 2000“That was from Kid A. We got canvases that were almost too big to comprehend. I rented a studio in Bath and Thom came down and we just painted. Some of those paintings have grit on them, or Artex – it’s a coating used to cover up mistakes and damage, but it doesn’t fix it.”Pacific Coast, 2003 (main image)“Radiohead were supposed to record Hail to the Thief in two weeks in LA. We would drive to the studio on Hollywood Boulevard, and the streets of LA were very textural, with a lot of big writing designed to be noticed by people driving by, all in the same bold seven colours. So I bought those colours and started painting words. Of course, they didn’t do the record in two weeks – my arse! – so we went back to rainy old England.”View image in fullscreenStanley Donwood’s Soken Fen, 2013.Photograph: Peter Stone/Courtesy of Stanley DonwoodSoken Fen, 2013“My initial idea for [Radiohead album] The King of Limbs was blurred photorealist paintings in oil, like Gerhard Richter, but it went very badly. Then Radiohead did a playthrough in this beautiful old barn. I thought: ‘Woah, this music is about growth and it’s organic.’ I thought about the people who’d built the barn with no machinery. I started painting these immediately.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Readers on the weirdest things they’ve found in a new homeFrom 1970s Y-fronts to gold teeth and carefully placed pennies, readers describe the strange, horrible, sometimes hilarious treasures left by previous occupantsAs told toSammy GecsoylerThu 7 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTShare‘When I opened the suitcase, I fell backwards and screamed’Our new house had once been the home of a ferry boat captain and his family. The previous owners requested that we dispose of anything left behind. “We’re going to find a body,” I told my husband as we considered the piles and piles of things in the den, the garage and the attic.It took a year of remodelling the house before I finally got around to sorting through the sheds. There was a lot of rotting junk: mouse-eaten baseball caps, a wooden bat, old cassette tapes and a very large suitcase. When I opened the suitcase, I fell backwards and screamed. My husband and neighbour came running up the driveway. It was a body in two parts: a full head of hair, arms, hands and a torso in one half; legs and feet in track pants and sneakers in the other. Both halves wore an Adidas tracksuit.We peered inside to get a better look. She was a full-size resuscitation doll, probably used to train ferry personnel in first aid and rescue. My husband looked at me, his mouth wide open and his eyebrows raised. “I told you so,” I said.BL, Washington, US‘They were perfectly, disgustingly beautiful’I moved into the house in 2006, but it took me almost 10 years to venture properly into our loft. It had been partly floored already, but I needed to finish the job to create an arts studio for my studies.The loft was completely empty, or so I thought. After poking about, I found a carrier bag wedged in the roof. Inside were about 10 pairs of old, worn-out, 1970s-style Y-fronts. The discovery amused and disgusted me. One pair had a logo that said “Half Way Inn”; another, in white, had a grubby brown colour on the front. I kept the four best pairs and put them on display in the studio. The pants would be horrible to most people, but they fascinated me and made me laugh. They were perfectly, disgustingly beautiful.A couple of years after the discovery, I started dating. My boyfriend did not understand my fascination with the pants – he is the opposite of me and very conventional. When we decided to move in together, he strongly made the point that I wasn’t allowed to bring them. It was him or the pants. I did consider hiding them.Oonagh, Angus, UK‘Our discovery explained the guilt-ridden prayer-meeting notes’My husband and I bought a property a few years ago from a couple. When we first visited the home, the wife was wearing an unmissable gold cross. She took charge of the viewing while her husband seemed relegated to the garage.After the couple moved out, we found a Bible sitting on an out‑of-the-way shelf in the garage. I flicked through it and found a folded sheet of paper with details of a prayer meeting. It belonged to the husband of the cross-clad former owner of the house. Written on the sheet of paper were the words: “Why I am at this prayer meeting today,” to which he had scribbled the response: “Because I always feel guilty.”Some months later, we noticed a blackbird flying in and out of the garage. It was building a nest and we wanted to see whether eggs had been laid. My partner went inside and climbed up a ladder. They had nested in a hard-to-reach corner. Next to the nest sat a smartphone. After we charged the phone up and switched it on, a ransomware notice flashed up, naming the prayer-meeting husband as the owner of the phone. Being fairly tech-savvy, it didn’t take too much effort to remove the ransom notice – and we were presented with a browser page dedicated to hirsute elderly women, featuring a dozen or so photos of ladies enjoying themselves. This appeared to explain his guilt-ridden prayer‑meeting notes.Anonymous‘Two weeks after the dog ate the mystery meat, my mum got a phone call’When I was in my 20s, with a newborn, I moved back to a flat my mum owned. She had rented it out to another woman who had recently given birth. They only lived there for six months, but they had made their mark on the place: their dogs had eaten the cushions off the sofa; it was a real mess.While cleaning, I found a carrier bag in the freezer that looked like a lump of liver. I’m a vegetarian, so I don’t know what different cuts of meat look like. We had a dog, so we put the mystery meat outside in the back garden and he ate it. We didn’t think anything of it, then two weeks later my mum got a phone call. It was the previous tenant, who said she had accidentally left her placenta behind and asked for it back. Mum didn’t tell her the dog ate it – she said it had been thrown away. You wouldn’t expect such an important thing to be left behind in the freezer …Melissa,Pembrokeshire, UK‘I’m so glad I had cleaning gloves on’In 1986, I bought my first flat. While clearing out the fitted wardrobes that came with it, I found a loose carrier bag tucked underneath a drawer. I opened it up and inside was an item that I thought looked like a man’s willy. I was right. On further inspection, I realised it was a used, battery-operated vibrator. I’m so glad I had cleaning gloves on.My elderly mum was with me when I discovered the bag. I said: “Oh, that can go in the bin.” Unaware of its contents, my mum replied: “She probably doesn’t realise she’s left that and might want it back. You should ring her.” After some back and forth, I showed her my discovery. She looked for a minute and then said: “Oh good God! Your father can take it to the tip.” I shoved it into a black bag with lots of other things that needed to go. Dad never knew what was inside.Sally, Wiltshire, UK‘I had never handled explosives before’I moved into an old farmhouse with my wife and her daughter in the early 1970s. The previous owner lost his temper a lot in our dealings with him; if we said something he didn’t like, he would raise his voice and put his fist up in the air. He frightened the wits out of my solicitor and I kept my contact with him as low as possible.When we moved into the house, he still had his animals and possessions in the outbuildings. When he finally took his stuff with him, I had a look around. In the dark corner of a room, lit by a single naked bulb, I found an old cardboard box labelled Nobel – the name of an explosives manufacturer with a factory nearby. I was pretty sure what I was going to find when I opened it. The box contained three or four sticks of explosives and detonators that looked brand new.I had never handled explosives before, so I phoned the police. It took them three hours to find me. When they arrived, I showed them what I had found and they said: “Oh yes, those are explosives,” and off they went. The next day, the bomb-disposal squad arrived, in a Morris Traveller, of all things, to remove the items. One of them returned from the outbuilding with the box and a broad smile on his face. I found out later that the explosives had started to become unstable; they would have gone off with a nasty bang if they had detonated.Alan, Wales, UKMoving house has never been so stressful. Which is why you need an elite squadron of helpers | Maddie ThomasRead more‘I left it out for the bin men, but I was worried they might think it was mine’In 1996, I moved into a house with my daughter. The previous owners, a couple with two children, were portly and eccentric. They left in such a rush that some things were forgotten. While cleaning out a cupboard in the master bedroom, I found a surprising item lodged on a top shelf: a flesh-coloured rubber sex suit made for two people. It was stuffed into its original packaging – after, I assume, being taken for a test run; it didn’t look pristine.It was a very odd sex item. It had instructions on the front on how to rub your bits together. Vibrators are one thing; full-body sex suits are another. Given their plump stature, I wasn’t sure how they would have got into it, never mind out of it. It certainly would have restricted blood supply. I left it out for the bin men, but I was worried they might think it was mine. They’re always asking for a tip, but who knows why. Maybe they’re after some hush money.NT, London, UK‘I laughed out loud with surprise and a kind of horror’Twenty years ago, I bought a charming home, but the inside was a neglected mess. I soon found myself on my knees in the bathroom, washing around the back of the toilet, when I encountered a small, crumpled package tucked out of sight. It was a handkerchief tied around something. My heart thumped wildly. Could they be jewels?Sadly not. I unfolded it and gasped to see five long, yellowy-brown teeth filled heavily with gold. I laughed out loud with surprise and a kind of horror. The estate agent gave me a forwarding address, so I wrote a note to the previous owners telling them of my find, but I never received a reply. I popped the teeth into a glass jar, thinking one day I would do something with them.I later sold the home and moved out of town. While at my local shopping centre, I saw a stall buying gold. I knew what I could sell. I tumbled the teeth on to the counter. The girl behind the till wasn’t fazed; she’d seen it all before. “Are they your father’s teeth?” she asked. “God, no,” I said, shocked at the suggestion. She got out some heavy-duty pliers and began crushing the teeth to separate the gold from the enamel. She put the nuggets on the scales and offered me A$60 for the lot. I quickly refused, as that seemed like a real rip-off. Years later, the remains of the golden teeth are still in that glass jar.Silda, Sydney, AustraliaView image in fullscreen‘The previous owners had left pennies on all the window sashes …’Composite: Guardian Design;  Tetra Images/Getty Images‘The pennies weren’t so much a goodwill wish as an attempt at poltergeist protection’I was ecstatic when my family and I moved to an old Victorian-era house on Long Island. After moving in, I noticed that the previous owners had left pennies on all the window sashes. I had no idea what it meant, but since they were nice people, I figured it was a gesture of goodwill on their part, representing good wishes for our future in the house.Several years later, as I was getting ready for bed, I heard a cacophonous racket in the attic above – the noise of someone stomping up and down and throwing boxes and furniture around. I sent my husband up to see what was going on and he found nothing: no one there; not a single item out of place. At that point, the word “poltergeist” popped into my mind. I’m not afraid of ghosts; I was charmed by the thought that we were sharing our new (old) house with one.Now, I think the pennies weren’t so much a goodwill wish as an attempt at poltergeist protection. It’s still a mystery to me.Nancy, New York, USThe contributors featured in this article responded to aCommunity callout.

The accident had nothing to do with the 3.1kg book, which was already safely on the back seat of the car by the time I didn’t notice the kerb or the cyclist. Years on, and the scene repeats on me whenever I see the cream cover of not just the heaviest, but maybe the most handsome cookbook on my shelves. Written by the journalist Giuseppe Coria and first published by Vito Cavallotto Editore in 1981, Profumi di Sicilia is an encyclopaedic exploration of Sicilian regional cooking – the smells, ingredients, recipes, folklore, trivia, traditions and origins. A significant part of the book’s great beauty is the photographs of ingredients, dishes and scenes by Melo Minnella, which saturate the pages with colour and which appear in pairs every eight pages of text.Broken into many familiar chapters and subchapters, with small line drawings – a snail, bowl, potato or flask – the hundreds of recipes are in paragraph form, with many containing no quantities at all – just a description of how to put ingredients together to make X. Others, meanwhile, have specific quantities included in the descriptive paragraph, but always with plenty of leeway; Giuseppe’s ability to judge when a reader/cook needs general advice and when they need specific quantities is not just impressive, but inspiring.The great number of recipes for each ingredient, which run into each other in narrative style, also makes the book a good, practical source of inspiration when you have an ingredient you are not quite sure what to do with, and hope the solution involves things you already have in the house. Last week, that was aubergines, which are now available all year, I know, but which are at their best from July to September (and also plentiful and, therefore, good value). Giuseppe has 25 aubergine recipes, and my favourites include braised in olive oil with potatoes and mint, as part of a caponata with capers and pine nuts, and “inagrodolce”. This week’s recipe is a mix of all three.Giuseppe suggests honey as thedolce(sweet) element, alongside red-wine vinegar to provide theagro(or the sour/acidic balance). Warmingthe two in a frying pan is ideal, because there is then plenty of space to roll the roast aubergine wedges in the dressing before adding the capers, pine nuts and mint, which is a natural and feisty partner for the velvet texture of the veg.Much likecaponataandscapece, this is best left to sit for at least an hour before eating, turning the aubergine wedges a few times so they sop up the dressing. Sweet-and-sour aubergines with capers, pine nuts and mint goes spectacularly well with lamb chops (mint sauce lovers will appreciate this), as well as with roast chicken or hard-boiled eggs. Alternatively, serve it alongside other room temperature dishes such as tabbouleh, chickpea and roast red pepper, or a tomato salad.Sweet-and-sour aubergines with capers, pine nuts and mintServes42 large or 4 slender auberginesOlive oilSalt2 tbsp red-wine vinegar2 tbsphoney, or sugar2 tbsp small capers1 tsppine nuts, or chopped almonds1 handfulfresh mint leaves,left whole is small, ripped if largePull the stalks off the aubergines, then cut them into long pieces (quarters or eighths, depending on the size of the aubergines). Rub with the olive oil and some salt (hands are the best tool for this), then arrange on a tray and bake 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 25 minutes, turning two or three times, until golden, soft and wrinkled.Meanwhile, warm the vinegar and honey in a frying pan, tasting to make sure that it is both sweet and sour to your liking. Add six tablespoons of olive oil and taste again. Add the roast aubergine in batches, turning until they glisten, then lift on to a serving plate, leaving most of the sauce in the pan.Add the capers, nuts and mint to the sweet-and-sour sauce, heat for a minute, then pour over the aubergines. Leave to sit for at least 30 minutes, turning occasionally, before serving.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkSide dishesStarterVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Garmin’s latest mid-range running and multisport watch has smartened up with a very bright OLED screen, voice assistant and upgraded sensors.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Forerunner 570 continues the revamp of the company’s running watches, which have all gained more accurate GPS chips and improved heart rate monitors. The new model replaces the popular 265 and sits under the 970. It offers a similar look and feel to the top watch but with a few key features removed for a lower price.Unfortunately the reduced price is still quite high at £450 (€550/$550/A$999), which puts the 570 well above most mid-range rivals and dangerously close to top-of-the-range money.The 570 has quite a few updated hardware and software features,compared with the 265. It comes in a choice of 42mm or 47mm sizes and in a range of fun colours – or black for those looking for something more understated.View image in fullscreenThe speaker just above the strap is loud and clear for laps and other alerts while running, or for the new Bluetooth calling and voice assistant features.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe polycarbonate body, metal buttons and aluminium bezel feel high quality, with a super bright, crisp and great-looking OLED touchscreen.Like theFenix 8andForerunner 970, the watch has Garmin’s newoffline voice command systemfor quickly setting timers, accessing settings, starting activities and other functions of the watch. It will alsoconnect to your phone’s voice assistantso you can speak to Siri or Gemini, or take calls on your wrist.The 570 has the same revamped interface as the 970, making it a more capable smartwatch for handling notifications or controlling music on your phone. It also supports the recentlyreleased Google Maps app, but only with Android phones.It can download various apps from theConnect IQ app storeincluding Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music or others for phone-free music on runs. Garmin Pay is available for contactless payments, thoughUK bank supportis very limited.View image in fullscreenThe 570 ships with plenty of interesting and customisable watch faces, with more available in the Connect IQ app store.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery of the 47mm watch lasts about five days of smartwatch use with the screen on all the time, which is a day or so short of the 970 or the 265. The 570’s default screen brightness is very high, however, so turning it down one level added about a day to the battery life. It will last about 10 days with the always-on display setting turned off.SpecificationsScreen:1.2in or 1.4in AMOLEDCase size:42mm or 47mmCase thickness:12.9mmBand size:standard 20mm or 22mmWeight:42g or 50gStorage:8GBWater resistance:50 metres (5ATM)Sensors:GNSS (Multiband GPS, Glonass, Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse OxConnectivity:Bluetooth, ANT+, wifiRunning and activity trackingView image in fullscreenThe bright and crisp display makes seeing lots of data fields and metrics while running easy at a glance, of which you can have up to eight on a single screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Forerunner has Garmin’s latest optical heart rate sensor on the back and dual band GPS for some of the most accurate tracking available. It has more than 85 different sport profiles built in, so it will track most things.For running and triathlon it packs nearly everything that the 970 offers, including wrist-based power and running dynamics, adaptive coaching plans with suggested workouts, performance condition and various VO2 Max and fitness estimations. It lacks offline maps, however, only providing breadcrumb navigation on planned routes or back to the start of your run.It also includes Garmin’s useful recovery tools, such as training readiness, which are the best in the business. The only things it lacks are Garmin’s new impact load andrunning tolerance featuresthat are limited to the 970, which is a shame.The battery lasts about 14 hours of running with the highest accuracy settings or about eight hours while also listening to offline music from Spotify using Bluetooth headphones, which is solid but not class leading and several hours short of the 970.View image in fullscreenThe watch charges via a USB-C cable that slots into the port next to the sensor cluster on the back, reaching 70% in about 40 minutes and full in 83 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 570 has all of Garmin’s most recent general health tracking features, including its excellent body battery system, a sleep coach, morning and evening health and recovery briefings, stress, women’s health and heart health, with one exception: it lacks the ability to record an ECG. With similarly priced rivals from Apple, Google and Samsung all supporting the feature thathelps spot heart conditions, it seems like a miss.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenVoice command can quickly access offline features on the watch, but only with the correct phrases.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe watch is generally repairable with optionsavailable via support. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees security updates until at least 21 May 2027 but typically supports its devices far longer. It offersrecycling schemeson new purchases.PriceThe Garmin Forerunner 570 costs £459.99 (€549.99/$549.99/A$999).For comparison, theGarmin Fenix 8starts from£780, theForerunner 970costs£630, theForerunner 165£250, the Coros Pace 3£219, the Suunto Run£199and the Polar Pacer Pro£299.VerdictThe Forerunner 570 is a great running watch that is priced just a little too high to be a wholehearted recommendation.It looks great with standout colours, a super bright and crisp screen, and many of the good bits of theForerunner 970. It is one of the most accurate for GPS and heart rate tracking, records almost every metric under the sun, and plugs into Garmin’s unrivalled training and recovery systems. It also works pretty well as a day-to-day smartwatch.The lack of offline maps, a built-in torch, ECG or the latest running tolerance features, and a shorter daily-use battery life could be excused at a lower price. But at £460 or equivalent, the 570 stacks up poorly against more feature-rich rivals making it one to look out for on a deal.Pros:super bright OLED screen, phone and offline voice control, Garmin Pay, extensive tracking and recovery analysis for running and many other sports, offline Spotify, buttons and touch, most accurate GPS.Cons:expensive, no ECG, no offline maps, no running tolerance, no torch, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches, shorter battery life than other Forerunners.View image in fullscreenOffline Spotify or other music streaming services remain a killer feature that other dedicated running watches can’t match.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGarminSmartwatchesWearable technologyGadgetsRunningreviewsShareReuse this content"

(I’m now in my mid-forties.) It started off small, but is now about 5cm long, 1cm high and a fewmillimeters raised off my skin. It sometimes itches or feels tight and painful, but otherwise is just an unattractive inconvenience.Having said that, it’s had a horrible and disproportionate impact on my confidence. Is there any way to reduce the redness or the size, or stop it from growing? Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, what mindset should I take to reduce its importance, so that going to the swimming pool or beach is less of an ordeal?– Scarredfor LifeHave you been to the beach or the pool, Scarred for Life? I’m not asking if you’ve seen a beach scene in a movie or a commercial that takes place poolside. Have you been to anactualbeach or pool, populated byactualpeople? Maybe you’ve been too preoccupied with your scar to notice: almost everybody has a weird body!By “weird”, of course, I mean normal; the hyper-perfection of Hollywood is the real statistical anomaly. A sampling of features I scoped on my own recent beach outing: fat rolls, congenital moles and cellulite. Acne. Assne. Double chins, triple chins, chin hairs glistening in the sunlight. Sagging, wrinkling and/or jiggling skin. Pubic hair stubble. Top surgery scars, caesarean section scars and, yes, keloid scars. And I didn’t have to look very hard.Keloids – thick, raised scars that have “grown outside of the boundaries of the original wound”, accordingDr Michelle Henry, a board-certified dermatologist based in New York – affect an estimated10%of the world’s population. That’s 800 million people, or more than double the US population.“We see keloids more often in patients of African descent and Asian descent, but really, we see them in everyone,” Henry tells me. They are most likely to form on the chest or back, and indicate a sort of haywire healing response. When skin starts to repair a wound – a pimple, a scrape, a surgical incision – it sends collagen to the site to create scar tissue. “There are different checks and balances to tell the body when to stop laying down collagen, but with keloids, that goes unchecked,” Henry explains. (I generally try to avoid glorifying youthfulness, but here’s a fun fact to assuage some of your insecurity, Scarred: Henry says those prone to keloids may “age better”, cosmetically speaking, due to all that collagen.)These scars can feel itchy, tight and uncomfortable as they grow. Potential treatments include steroid injections, targeted radiation, cryotherapy and Botox to reduce size, as well as laser therapy to reduce redness. “Sometimes we do excise them,” Henry adds, “but that’s a very careful process, because you can end up with a scar that’s bigger than the original keloid.” You can consult a dermatologist to see if any of these options might work for you – but if you’re looking for something more low-key to try at home, Henry says silicone gels or patches can help.Tell us: share your experiences of traveling with friendsRead moreThat said, keloids don’t require treatment. They’re benign. They don’t pose a threat to your physical health, especially on your chest; medical intervention might be recommended if the scar were, say, close to your eye and affecting your vision, or on the back of your knee and affecting your movement. It’s your mental health that needs attention right now.My recommendation, besides deriving confidence from within–who you are, what you value and how you treat people? Recalibrate your concept of averageness.Averageness is “the most important aspect” of one’s understanding of beauty, said Dr Neelam Vashi, an associate professor of dermatology at Boston University’s medical school, on theApple News in Conversation podcast. It refers to how closely any given face or body matches that of the average person within their population.“Our population could be me looking at 1,000 images,” Dr Vashi explained. “What my brain does is looks at all of them, and then it makes a prototype [of beauty] in my head.”More from Jessica DeFino’sAsk Ugly:skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now he wants me and my mother to get work doneHow should I be styling my pubic hair?How do I deal with imperfection?I want to ignore beauty culture. But I’ll never get anywhere if I don’t look a certain wayThanks to the prevalence of filters, photo-editing technology and AI-generated imagery, people’s prototypes now reference digitally altered inputs, said Vashi. This means scarred, middle-aged skin might not fit your brain’s idea of attractiveness, or even normality.The good news: brains are malleable! Vashi citeda 2009 studyin which researchers squished and stretched the faces of storybook characters and found that, after viewing altered images, children’s sense of what was beautiful subtly shifted toward the distortions.So start with some amateur exposure therapy. Go to the beach! Go to the pool! Go to a communal spa or a nude spa (Korean spas, known asjjimjilbangs,are my personal happy place).Notice different bodies, faces, skin types, textures – not to compare, judge or objectify, but to observe.Take it to the virtual realm: follow influencers with keloid scars on Instagram or TikTok. Watch the latest seasons of The Ultimatum: Queer Love and Love Island UK; both feature bikini-clad contestants with visible keloids. This will all help adjust your internal prototype.You say your scar is “unattractive”. I hope that working through this gets you closer to neutrality. You don’t have to find your scar beautiful to be confident. Just realize that your body is like any other: bizarre and inconsistent and specific and alive, and worthy of a nice day at the beach.Share your experienceAsk us a questionDo you have a beauty question for Ask Ugly?

I suppose lists of this year’s “in” and “out” resorts help tourists decide where to go; no point going to Skegness for Michelin-starred food, or to Salcombe for a laugh and cheap beer. Less obvious coastal towns provide more nuanced fare. Perhaps the most alluring spots are those where we don’t forget the sea. These three towns are routinely ranked last resorts or else ignored altogether, but they offer more than stuff to eat, drink, buy and post on socials – and are close to swimmable beaches.Ayr, AyrshireView image in fullscreenA view of the Isle of Arran from Ayr.Photograph: Allan Wright/AlamyA century ago, Clyde steamers and the Glasgow and South Western Railway took thousands of sunseekers from inland towns to the Ayrshire coast. They came to escape the smoke and noise of industry, breathe in the briny air, and admire the Isle of Arran and tiny Ailsa Craig – from afar or up close on an excursion. The bed and breakfasts on elegant Park Circus (a sweeping crescent lined with cherry trees that blossom red on one side and white on the other) and the Georgian villas on Eglinton Terrace evoke something of the golden days of yore.It’s easy to imagine parasol-sporting ladies and tall-hatted gents strolling across the Low Green, a large field between the town centre and the beach. This open space – perfect for picnics, kite-flying and impromptu games – and the absence of any clutter on the prom make the seafront unusually peaceful. It’s as if Ayr has refused to become a traditional resort. No tat, no tack, not many tourists. There are places to play on swings and get an ice-cream or a pint, but lovers of amusement arcades and bucket-and-spade shops should probably stay away. On the short block beside the Low Green the buildings are mainly residential – including care homes, that standard fixture of coastal towns.Ayr is an ideal hideaway for those who want to do beach walks, read or write, and check into small, friendly guest housesThe beachis a golden sweep about two miles in length, with the old harbour at the north end. Wharves and quays once bustled all along the River Ayr. By the 14th century, this was Scotland’s principal west coast port. In the 18th century, more than 300 ships were moored every year, unloading American tobacco, French wine, Spanish salt, English earthenware and slate from Easdale in the Firth of Lorn. Walk south and you come to the ruins of Greenan Castle, a 16th-century clifftop tower. The sunsets over Arran are life-enhancing. I watched a woman of retirement age do her tai chi moves while keeping her eyes fixed on the island – spiritually separate from the dog-walkers and prom-striders.View image in fullscreenThe Tam o’ Shanter Inn is one of the pubs that claims to be Ayr’s oldest.Photograph: Andy Arthur/AlamyRobert Burns was born near Ayr and baptised in the Auld Kirk. In Tam o’ Shanter he writes: “Auld Ayr, wham ne’er a town surpasses, / For honest men and bonny lasses”. Alively pubon the high street, which is set back a good mile from the beach, is named after the poem; it claims to be the oldest in Ayr, but so does theBlack Bullon the opposite side of the river. Theold bridge(or Auld Brig, if you prefer, which inspired another Burns poem) that takes you across is pedestrianised and a beauty. All the old pubs are enticing but I had my most enjoyable, peaceful beer and dram in theTwa Dugs– also named for a Burns poem. In Ayr’s Waterstones, I found a long-overlooked 1969 Booker-nominated novel by Gordon M Williams,From Scenes Like These, that provided a brutally realistic riposte to Burns-esque takes on rural Scotland. I read it in the boozers, the caffs, on benches.People in Ayr will tell you the town has declined. They’ll tell you that in nine out of 10 seaside resorts. But this column gets me around, and I can vouch for the town’s general busyness and good looks. Sedate, somewhat stern, bereft of traditional fun stuff, it’s an ideal hideaway for those who want to do beach walks, read or write, and check into small, friendly guest houses.Things to see and do:Rozelle House Museum,Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, Culzean Castle and Country ParkBangor, GwyneddView image in fullscreenA quiet corner of Bangor.Photograph: Howard Litherland/AlamyBangor, the oldest city in Wales, came second from bottom in theWhich? 2025rankings and absolute bottom in 2024. Perhaps the latter partly anticipated the former. Casually saddle a place with derision and it takes a great effort to shake it off.As the gateway to the island of Ynys Môn (Anglesey), a university town and former royal capital, Bangor doesn’t need star ratings or hip amenities. The city’s origins stretch back to the founding of a monastery in the early sixth century. A cathedral was later built on the site. For centuries, Bangor was the spiritual and ecclesiastical hub for Gwynedd – a kingdom until the English came a-conquering – but remained a small settlement. Nonetheless, during the first flush of Welsh tourism, at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, pleasure steamers from Liverpool brought visitors to see the big church and the wild waters of the Menai Strait.This might be the best-connected seaside town in the UK with with Eryri national park, Caernarfon Castle and the Llŷn peninsula accessible by busThe boom years came after 1826 with the completion of the Holyhead Road, linking London with Dublin – hitched to the recently created UK by the 1800 Acts of Union. The first major civilian state-funded road building project in Britain since the Roman era, the job was given to Thomas Telford. The road (much of it on the same route as today’s A5) swept through central Bangor, making the former big village a major staging post, and creating the longest high street in Wales. To replace the ferry-shuttles, Telford’s magnificent Menai Suspension Bridge opened in 1826. Two decades later, Robert Stephenson built a tubular bridge to carry the Chester-Holyhead railway across the straits. With communications much improved, Bangor became a proper little port, with shipbuilding, sail making, iron founding, smithing and timber yards, as well as slate yards.View image in fullscreenThe magnificent Menai Suspension Bridge.Photograph: Slawek Staszczuk/AlamyWalk to the natural end of this high street – which turns residential – and you come to the shore, a pier and a large park between neo-NormanPenrhyn Castleand the sea. You don’t have an in-town beach, which might be why some of the raters have a low opinion of Bangor. But theWales Coast Pathand the railway line link Bangor with beaches at Llanfairfechan and Penmaenmawr, eight and 10 miles away respectively. In fact, this might be the best-connected seaside town in the UK, withEryri national park(Snowdonia), Unesco-listed Caernarfon Castle and Criccieth and theLlŷn peninsulaaccessible by bus, and of course Anglesey on the doorstep.Things to see and do:walk the Menai Suspension Bridge,kayaking off Caernarfon,Aber Falls DistilleryMillom, CumbriaView image in fullscreenMillom, Cumbria, with Black Combe behind.Photograph: Jon Sparks/AlamyThe Cumbrian coast is the most intriguing stretch of littoral in these islands. Backed by the towering, cloud-drawing fells of the national park, the shore is often beneath a blue dome. The towns along it are chapters in British social history. Whitehaven is like a Devon port town without the crowds. Workington is a fascinating ex-industrial town. Nethertown is a hidden hamlet in a spectacular setting.Millom, at the southern tip of the old county of Cumberland, is a stop on the coast-hugging railway line – a superlative train ride – betweenBarrow-in-Furness and Sellafield. Its main connection to the nexuses of nuclear war and power are the Millomites who commute south and north for work. Millom once had industry;hematite ore(iron oxide) was found at Hodbarrow in 1856 and mined till 1968, the population swelling to 10,000. Much of the land was transformed into anRSPB nature reserve, centred on the north-west’s largest coastal lagoon; little, common and sandwich terns breed on the islands and you can see ringed plovers, redshanks, great crested grebes and oystercatchers around the wetlands.The views from the summit of Black Combe are magnificent – with Blackpool Tower and Scafell Pike visible in clear weatherMillom is tiny, but has none of the jams and crowds of the villages in the nearby Lakes. The Camra-ratedBear on the Squarehas real ales, good food and live music. The town has its own fell – Black Combe – and while only a 600-metreMarilyn, its isolation and proximity to the sea make it feel higher. The views from the summit are magnificent – with Blackpool Tower and Scafell Pike visible in clear weather.The poetNorman Nicholson(1914-1987) was born in Millom and spent almost all his life here, shunning metropolitan literary circles and asserting that the much-maligned “provincial” has more in common with people of other times and lands and consequently “may be all the more aware of that which is enduring in life and society”. The titles ofhis booksreflect the locale:Rock Face(1948);The Shadow of Black Combe(1978);Sea to the West(1981). St George’s church has a stained-glass windowdesigned by Christine Boycethat was inspired by Nicholson’s writing. His house is being restored, while Millom as a whole is undergoing amajor rebuildwith heritage and health projects afoot as well as a 7.5-mile walking and cycling trail.For a swim, head toSilecroftby train (one stop) or on foot (3.5 miles);Haverigg beach, though closer, often has pollution warnings.Things to see and do:Millom Heritage and Arts Centre,Swinside Stone CircleFurther information:Visit Scotland,Visit CumbriaandVisit WalesExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysWhere tourists seldom treadSummer holidaysFamily holidaysCultural tripsDay tripsShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I worry now upon reflection that my intellect is too loud. I value intelligence and am, by a long shot, not the smartest in my family or friendship circle (which I love and think is very important), but there are oft times when I meet new people or have interactions with clients that I’ve thought, “Ah, cripes, I didn’t need to say it like that, it sounds like I’m showing off.”My father finally acknowledged my stepmother’s cruelty. How do I ask him to reconsider their marriage? | Leading questionsRead moreEleanor says:I had a similar chat once with a friend who moved to the United States for her PhD around the same time I did. When we went back home and met new people, they’d say: “What do you do?” We’d say: “PhD in America.” They’d say: “Cool, where?” And we’d wince about truthfully answering “Princeton”. As though saying so came with a big studio placard:applause. Sometimes we’d pretend the question was about geography and say “New Jersey” instead. But we both quickly realised that was weirder – like what, the news that we’re moderately clever is so trying for strangers back home that it’s only polite to conceal it? For heaven’s sake, with ego like that, what use is politeness?Point of the story: letting other people see your intelligence isn’t necessarily patronising. Carefully concealing it as a favour to them sure is.I think the heart of your question is how to reveal intelligence in a way that doesn’t feel like asserting hierarchy. And I think the heart of the answer is unsticking it from anything much aboutyou.There’s a way of thinking about traits such as intelligence – or musicality, athleticism or anything we possess in different measures – as gifts that run through us, that don’t really redound to our credit.This is not how we’re taught to think about them. From when we’re knee high we get on stage and clutch certificates rewardingus,such that “aren’t you clever” can feel synonymous with “aren’t you marvellous”.But these traits are largely heritable and the product of socioeconomic fortune. Hard work is involved, of course, but everyone with any kind of talent got it partly by being lucky.If you think of your traits as happy hits from the lottery stick, then it doesn’t feel so wincey or rude to let them show. They’re just gifts you happened to receive, and you can make life nicer and more beautiful by figuring out how to share them. Yo-Yo Ma doesn’t refuse to play so as to avoid making other people feel bad.How can I stop fixating on my appearance? | Leading questionsRead moreI think intelligence feels “quiet” in theDua Lipa, dignified way when it has this quality of generous sharing. It’s about appreciating others’ minds, and creating more beauty and interest for others. It looks straight through to an idea, to the world, not through a lens of: “What does this say about me?”In contrast, intelligence feels noisy and show-offy when its bearer clearly thinks it’s an exciting feature ofthemthat they have it. That’s when it feels like the gifted child deliberately saying a long word for the grown-ups. And that’s why it can be every bit as condescending to conceal it as to reveal it: the show-off and the mealy mouthed downplayer are both making the same egotistical mistake.Maybe the conversation between Dua Lipa andHelen Garnerthat got you thinking about this is also a nice place to find an answer. Impressive women, sharing their intelligence with grace and generosity. Talent turned outwards for others, not angled in to shine mainly on its owner.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsLife and styleLeading questionsAustralian lifestyleHelen GarnerDua LipafeaturesShareReuse this content"

But these are very different times.When the US vice-president, JD Vance, and his family join David Lammy at the foreign secretary’s grace and favour home in Kent at the start oftheir summer holiday in the UK, they are expected to deepen their relationship by praying together, it is understood.Within the grounds of Chevening lies the pretty 12th-century St Botolph’s church. It is Anglican but, security risks and denominational differences aside, it may present one option for a place to take communion, sources suggested.Vance is a Catholic and Lammy has described his faith as Anglo-Catholic. The two men previously took mass in Vance’s residence in Washington when the vice-president hosted Lammy and his family in March.The burgeoning relationship between the two men, freshly evidenced by word that they will spend time together before the Vances head to the Cotswolds, may surprise some.As a backbencher, Lammy describedDonald Trumpas “a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”. Now, Trump is “someone that we can build a relationship with” and Vance is a “friend”.The philosophy behind Lammy’s foreign policy has been described as “progressive realism” – taking the world as it is and not as we might wish it to be.Sceptics might be temped to describe such a pivot in different terms but the outcomes were difficult to argue with, said Michael Martins, formerly a political specialist in the US embassy in London and founder of the consultancy firm Overton Advisory.“I think they have done a pretty good job and you can see it with some of the incoming tariff increases which have not affected the UK as they have with other trading partners, like Canada,” Martins said.“I think it is paying off. I think President Trump’s view on Putin and Russia has changed, is changing and softening, in a way that I think the British government has been pushing for. I think the dividends from the relationship building are starting to come.”Lammy, a touchy-feely sort of politician, targeted Vance for a full charm offensive early on, when Labour was in opposition and Trump’s re-election was far from certain, sources said. The then shadow foreign secretary had a significant obstacle to overcome: Lammy has been a friend ofBarack Obamasince they met at a 2005 gathering of Harvard Law School’s black alumni.Such was the love-in that Lammy’s wife, Nicola Green, an artist, was given “unprecedented access” to chronicle Obama’s 2008 campaign. It was this political and personal relationship that has been front and centre of every US newspaper profile of Lammy in recent times. “A Friend of Obama Who Could Soon Share the World Stage With Trump” was the New York Times headline last April.View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy and his wife, Nicola Green, are longstanding friends with the Obamas.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyLammy had a further card to play. He has spoken about how Vance’s bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy,bore parallels to his own storyof growing up with a single mother and an absent, alcoholic father. Lammy has said Vance’s book “reduced me to tears”.“I said to JD: ‘Look, we’ve got different politics, but we’re both quite strong Christians and we both share quite a tough upbringing,’” Lammy said of an early meeting.He recently elaboratedin an interview with the Guardian. During drinks with Vance and the deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, in the US ambassador’s residence at the time of the new pope’s inauguration, Lammy had an epiphany. It struck him that they were “not just working-class politicians, but people with dysfunctional childhoods”, he said. “I had this great sense that JD completely relates to me and he completely relates to Angela.”Donjeta Miftari, a former foreign policy adviser to Keir Starmer in Downing Street who is now a director at Hanbury Strategy, said: “David is an incredibly pragmatic person and he likes to take the world as it is. Frankly, you don’t have influence over which populations elect certain individuals in the country.”JD Vance’s team had water level of Ohio river raised for family’s boating tripRead moreLammy had had a gut feeling that the Republicans would win the White House back, she said, and he worked for “years, not months” on building the necessary relationships.“I’ve known him for a few years now, and I’d say that he is also, just on a personal level, one of the most empathetic and relational kind of MPs and politicians,” she said.“You know, in the early days of opposition and in government, I think he had a strong sense of where the US was going, and that is grounded in the fact that he studied out there, lived out there. He knows America well and it’s a big part of who he is.“So I think he sort of clocked basically that that is the direction in which the country was going so built these relationships well before they came to power in the US. And I think that gives it, like, extra kind of credibility and authenticity as well, because you’re not just calling them when you need them when you’re both in post. He’s an incredibly effective operator. Frankly, he’s quite good company as well, which always helps.”There will be a formal bilateral meeting between the two politicians before Vance’s wife, Usha, and their three children join Lammy, his wife and their children for the weekend. After their stay with the Lammys, the Vances are understood to be heading to a Cotswolds period property near Charlbury, about 12 miles (19km) north-west of Oxford.Martins, who was working in the US embassy at the time of Trump’s first state visit, said he recalled the delight that the president took in the pomp and ceremony. “I think vice-president Vance has to walk a bit of a delicate line,” he said. “Obviously he is angling for his own White House bid at the end of the Trump presidency. You know, I think he has to be careful not to appear as the primary recipient of international flattery.”Explore more on these topicsDavid LammyJD VanceForeign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpBarack ObamaUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This sit-down with Blanche – who defendedDonald Trumpin criminal proceedings before working in his justice department – came amid extensive criticism of the president’s botched release of Epstein investigative files.The Epstein scandal is once again roiling American politics with many especially focused on the exact nature of Trump’s own social links to Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019.JD Vance to meet with top Trump officials to plot Epstein strategy – reportRead moreTrump had vowed on the campaign trail to release the Epstein files, a siren song to the many Maga devotees convinced that a network of elites protected Epstein and potentially participated in his sex trafficking of teen girls. But Trump’s justice department then later released a memorandum stating that there was no Epstein client list and elected not to release extensive case files.Following the backtracking, several reports highlighting Trump’s past ties to Epstein stoked still more suspicion. The Wall Street Journal published anarticlealleging that Trump contributed a “bawdy” letter to a birthday book for Epstein. Not long after this story was published, Trumpsaidthat he had instructed the justice department to request unsealing of grand jury transcripts in Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal proceedings.The newspaper on 23 July reported that his attorney general, Pam Bondi, told him that there were multiple instances of his name in the Epstein files, potentially negating whatever benefit he hoped would come from his grand jury directive. The House oversight committee on Tuesday subpoenaed Trump’s justice department for Epstein investigation files,per the Associated Press– further amplifying comment surrounding Maxwell’s improved prison conditions.Several longtime defense attorneys said that Maxwell’s reassignment to FPC Bryan suggested she provided useful information to the justice department officials she talked with. It’s also possible that this transfer foreshadows still better conditions for Maxwell – including possible release, they speculated.“My thinking is: if it walks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck,” said Randy Zelin, a longtime defense attorney who has taught law at Cornell Law School. “If someone who is in a really not nice prison gets moved to a nicer prison, there is typically a reason behind that, and it’s not merely because you are the next contestant on The Price Is Right or today’s your lucky day.Ghislaine Maxwell is not a victim. And if she is pardoned, it won’t be for the sake of justice | Arwa MahdawiRead more“It would appear to me that when Ms Maxwell was questioned under what we call a ‘proffer agreement’ by the government, the answers that she gave were found to be credible, they were found to be truthful and they were found to be helpful,” Zelin said. “In exchange for her being helpful and being truthful and being candid and being cooperative, she had a [benefit] conferred upon her, which is: she’s in much nicer digs than she was before she provided her help to the government.”While the Bureau of Prisons has discretion over inmate placement, Zelin surmises there was probably an agreement between the correctional agency and the justice department to move Maxwell.“It’s not a coincidence, and it’s either because she’s helping the Department of Justice go after other people, or she has more or less exonerated the president, and she has told the Department of Justice that she knows of absolutely nothing inappropriate, untoward or gross that took place between the president andJeffrey Epstein,” Zelin said.Asked if one should look at Maxwell’s move as a one-off, Zelin said no. “This is the beginning, not the end.”For Sam Bassett, a criminal defense attorney with Austin, Texas-based law firm Minton, Bassett, Flores & Carsey, publicity surrounding Maxwell’s meeting is particularly interesting.“One of the things that intrigued me about the whole situation with her interview is how public it was and how public her lawyer was about it. I know that when my clients cooperate, either post conviction or even before they’re convicted, it’s something that I like to keep under wraps,” Bassett said.He noted that one reason for privacy surrounding meetings and cooperation is because other inmates tend to look down upon those who cooperate. “So it really flagged to me that this was kind of a political move on a lawyer’s part. It puts some pressure on the president or his staff to consider a pardon or commutation at some point.”As for Maxwell’s transfer, Bassett said it could stem from security reasons – such as threats at her previous prison in Florida – or her lawyers requested a move. But it was “unusual” that a person found culpable of such a serious crime as sex trafficking would end up in a prison camp.“Maybe it’s to be a recognition for cooperation, giving her more freedom, so to speak, in a facility,” he said, noting that a move to a lower-security facility might be considered a favor to some. “The question is: is this a foreshadowing of bigger favors to come?Neama Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial lawyers and a former federal prosecutor, said there were multiple possibilities behind the move.“It could be something huge or just a mere coincidence,” Rahmani said. “The Bureau of Prisons has complete control over inmate placement, and especially when you deal with female inmates, there’s not as many facilities, so the options are more limited.”Rahmani said that sex trafficking was considered a more serious crime, a crime of violence, “so her being moved to a minimum security camp would be atypical, but it’s not unheard of”.That said, the chronology continues to raise many questions. Maxwell met with Blanche, she is vying for relief from the US supreme court, and potentially will testify before Congress.“The timing of it all leads me to believe that maybe something big is really happening, and by something big, that has to be a cooperation, right? That’s really all she has to offer.” For Maxwell, relief could take the form of prosecutors requesting a resentencing, prison officials moving her to home confinement, or a pardon.A veteran legal public relations expert, who spoke under the condition of anonymity as they have clients in federal custody, surmised Maxwell “must have provided prosecutors with information that was valuable enough post conviction for her to warrant these more favorable sentencing conditions – and they’re considerably more favorable”.“The interesting thing to outsiders is it appears that she’s a cooperating witness, though, at this point, she’s cooperating against a corpse, and a corpse cannot be convicted,” they said.The public relations veteran described the Maxwell-Blanche meeting as “part one” of a process potentially resulting in better sentencing conditions.“Part two is the public finding out, through DoJ disclosure, what information she actually provided,” they said. “I do think that there’s going to be some mechanism for them to release what she shared – and I think what she shared was indeed favorable enough to secure these lessened conditions.”Asked for comment about Maxwell’s transfer, a senior administration official said: “Any false assertion this individual was given preferential treatment is absurd. Prisoners are routinely moved in some instances due to death threats, and significant safety and danger concerns.”Trump’s justice department pointed to Blanche’s tweet about his meeting with Maxwell, in which he said they “will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time”.Neither the Bureau of Prisons nor Maxwell’s lawyer immediately responded to requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpanalysisShareReuse this content"

Hundreds of civilians remain unaccounted for.The magnitude of likely casualties means the assault by the RSF ranks only behinda similar ethnic slaughterin West Darfur two years ago.The war between the Arab-led RSF and Sudanese military, which broke out in April 2023, has been characterised by repeated atrocities, forcing millions from their homes and causingthe world’s largest humanitarian crisis.Until now, reports about the attack on Zamzam between 11 and 14 April had indicated that up to 400 non-Arab civilians were killed during the three-day assault. The UN has said“hundreds”died.However, a committee set up to investigate the death toll has so far “counted” more than 1,500 killed in the attack, which occurred on the eve of aBritish government-led conferencein London intended to bring peace to Sudan.Mohammed Sharif, part of the committee from Zamzam’s former administration, said the final total would be significantly higher, with many bodies still not recovered from the camp, which is now controlled by the RSF.“Their bodies are lying inside homes, in the fields, on roads,” Sharif told the Guardian.An atrocity expert with decades of experience in Darfur, who has interviewed scores of survivors from Zamzam, believes up to 2,000 people may have been killed.Speaking on condition of anonymity, they added that the levels of violence were striking even when viewed alongside thegenocidal slaughterof ethnic African groups in Darfur during the 2000s by the Arab militias who would later become the RSF.“Every single testimony from everyone who escaped knew family members who were killed. That’s something I’ve never seen before.”Abdallah Abugarda, of the UK’s Darfur Diaspora Association, said that about 4,500 members of his organisation knew a friend or relative killed in the attack.At least 2,000 Zamzam residents, he said, remain missing.“The massacre at Zamzam, home to displaced people for over 20 years, is one of the most heinous crimes in recent global history. Yet no global outrage has followed,” added Abugarda.Claire Nicolet, deputy head of emergencies forMédecins Sans Frontières(MSF), said the attack had targeted “one of the most vulnerable people on earth”. Those who survived, she said, had faced “widespread looting, sexual violence and other attacks while on the road and appalling living conditions in transit displacement sites”.Large numbers of women were abducted and remain missing. Sharif said they knew of more than 20 who had been taken to Nyala, an RSF stronghold 160km from Zamzam.Dossier of alleged Sudan war crimes handed to Metropolitan policeRead moreLast month, the International Criminal Court said it had“reasonable grounds”to conclude that war crimes and crimes against humanity were unfolding in Darfur.In Geneina, West Darfur’s capital,more than 10,000 people– mainly Masalit and other non-Arab Sudanese – are believed to have been killed by the RSF and allied militias over two months from mid-April 2023.An episode of fighting during November that yearin a suburb of El Geneinakilled more than 800, according to the UN.The Sudanese military has also been accused of myriad war crimes, in particular the massacre of civilians in indiscriminate bombing raids.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

And it will not be worthy of him to be the head of state of a country that he profited from in slavery and [for which he] failed to apologise and failed to make reparations. He will not be a worthy king,” Gill said. He argued the new revelations gave added urgency to efforts to remove the King as head of state in Grenada.Baptiste’s research was verified by a University of Manchester professor, Edmond Smith, and Nick Draper, founder of University College London’s Legacies of British Slave-ownership project.Smith, who is supervising a PhD study on the royal family’s role in slavery, said as more evidence is uncovered the monarchy’s profits from slavery will become clearer. He said this payment “might well just be the tip of the iceberg”.Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to a request for comment.King Charles has backed the study led by Smith, followinga 2023 Guardian reportrevealing that in 1689 King William III received £1,000 ($1,343) in shares in the Royal African Company, which trafficked thousands of enslaved Africans to the Americas.“This evidence fits with long-term patterns of colonial exploitation by the British royal family, including repeated efforts to find novel income streams from colonies in theCaribbean,” Smith told Reuters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means, for example, cheeses that are normally hit with import duties of 14.9% will be taxed at 15% and not 29.9%.Since the announcement late on Thursday last week, governments around the world have been racing to try to reach deals to avert border taxes they fear could deter investors and result in job losses.View image in fullscreenPresident Lula Da Silva talks on 5 August about the tariffs that President Trump will apply to Brazil.Photograph: Ton Molina/NurPhoto/RexThe Swiss president, Karin Keller-Sutter, was in Washington on Tuesday for two days of meetings with senior Trump administration officials to try to reverse a 39% levy thatblindsided the governmentwhen it was unveiled.The Swiss government were set to hold an “extraordinary meeting” on Thursday, following the return of officials from WashingtonMeanwhile, India’s 25% tariff rate could rise to a total of 50% after Trump signed an executive order on Wednesdayimposing an additional levyin retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil from Russia.

However, the train’s engineers have wrestled with the problem of the shock waves that occur as the train exits the mouth of a tunnel.When a high-speed train enters an enclosed space such as a tunnel, air in front is compressed, like in a piston. The resulting fluctuations in air pressure coalesce at the tunnel mouth, generating low-frequency shock waves. These are colloquially known as a “tunnel boom” – a related, albeit different phenomenon to the “sonic boom” heard as aircraft pass the speed of sound. Tunnel booms pose serious challenges to operational safety, as the shock waves can disturb humans and animals nearby, as well as causing structural damage.Now, however, researchers have discovered that placing innovative soundproofing buffers at tunnel mouths can reduce shock waves by up to 96%. This promises improvements in operational safety, noise pollution and passenger comfort, as well as safeguarding animals in the vicinity of future lines.This was already a well documented problem for conventional high-speed trains, which travel at speeds of up to 350km/h (217mph), but it worsens significantly for trains travelling at even higher speeds because the strength of the shock wave increases rapidly and the critical length that gives rise to a tunnel boom drops off quickly. For example, a train travelling at 600km/h will lead to a boom in a tunnel just 2km (1.2 miles) long, while for conventional high-speed trains this happens only in tunnels which are 6km or longer.The porous structure of the new 100-metre long buffers, combined with porous coatings on the tunnel body, allow the trapped air to escape before the train reaches the tunnel mouth, suppressing the boom in the same way as a silencer fitted to a firearm.Magnetic levitation refers to the use of magnetic force to suspend a train above a guideway or rail, sometimes with a height of only 10mm, by either electromagnetic or electrodynamic suspension. The train is then propelled using other electromagnets. While conventional high-speed trains are ultimately limited in speed due to increased wear and tear of wheels against the track, the separation of track and train means that maglevs are not subject to the same frictional forces.Electromagnetic suspension (EMS) has the train hugging a single steel rail with a U-shaped underside. When electromagnets positioned in the U-shape underneath the rail are switched on, the train is levitated by the resultant electromagnetic forces. With electrodynamic suspension (EDS), the train sits in a U-shaped guideway, with superconducting coils embedded in guideway and train. When the power supply is switched on, magnetic poles are induced in the coils, leading to a combination of repulsive and attractive forces which enable the train to levitate.High-speed maglev trainsmade their debut in 2004 in China, running between Pudong airport and the outskirts of Shanghai at 460km/h (286mph), a speed record that still holds for rail vehicles in regular commercial service. Built using German ‘Transrapid’ technology, this service caters primarily to foreign travellers as local people prefer the much cheaper, albeit slower, metro.However, this initial hype was soon eclipsed, as subsequent development of China’s rail network focused entirely on conventional high-speed rail. The national network is now the world’s largest in length at 48,000km (30,000 miles), with more lines under construction.But maglev trains are now making a comeback under the state-owned manufacturer CRRC, which launched the new model in 2021. There is no mechanical noise, passengers describing the quiet hum of electromagnets and a ride smoother than a conventional train.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Flights emit on average seven times more CO2than high-speed rail by distance travelled, representing a big potential carbon saving.China is not the only place where long-distance high-speed maglevs are on the horizon. Japan also has its hopes pinned on the Chuo Shinkansen, which will link its two biggest cities of Tokyo and Osaka via Nagoya, cutting through the heart of the country. The Tokaido Shinkansen, a conventional high-speed rail line, does this journey in 2.5 hours, but it is hoped that the new maglev line travelling at 505km/h (314mph) will reduce this to just 67 minutes. It was originally scheduled to begin partial service in 2027, but inevitable delays have encumbered the project, with a new opening date uncertain.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentChinaRail transportAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Her officepreviously described their treatment as “reprehensible”and a threat to “our national sovereignty”.While Australia’s consul general inHong Konghad previously raised concerns about the letters with local officials, Wong’s elevation of the issue during a meeting on the sidelines of the Asean summit has not been revealed until now.Hui, an Australian resident and former Hong Kong politician, was also the subject of fake pamphlets that accused him of being a pro-Israel lawyer willing to “wage war” against Islamic terrorism. The letters weremailed to a mosquenear his workplace and included his contact details.Hui and Yam are wanted by Hong Kong authorities for allegedly breaching acontroversial national security lawthat grants authorities sweeping extraterritorial powers to prosecute acts or comments made anywhere in the world that it deems criminal.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“We have consistently expressed our strong objections toChinaand Hong Kong on the broad and extraterritorial application of Hong Kong’s national security legislation and we will continue to do so,” a spokesperson for Wong said.“Freedom of expression and assembly are essential to our democracy.”The letters and pamphlets were mailed from Hong Kong or Macau, a special administrative region of China. Hong Kong authorities have denied sending the letters but this has not convinced the Australian government.Yam, who has previously accused Hong Kong of interfering with his “fundamental freedoms and democratic rights as an Australian”, said he was grateful the minister had raised the issue with her Chinese counterpart.“Transnational repression can be devastating in forms both brazen and subtle and I hope the government will take all these different forms with the utmost seriousness,” Yam said.Hui, who wasconvicted in absentiafor his role in pro-democracy protests during 2019, said Wong’s decision to raise the issue with Yi was “the right move”.“Australians need to see that we’re not trading away everything just to restore economic ties,” Hui said.In late July, Hong Kong also issued an arrest warrant for the Australian pro-democracy campaigner Dr Feng Chongyi, who is a professor of China studies at the University of Technology Sydney.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2017, he wasdetained for 10 dayswhile on a research trip to China.Speakingto the ABC in July, Feng described the arrest warrant as “political persecution and violation of basic human rights”.Wong’s spokesperson said “Australia strongly objects to Hong Kong authorities issuing arrest warrants for pro-democracy advocates in Australia”.China’s embassy in Australia was contacted for comment.In July 2023, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ningurged Australia, the UK and the US to stop sheltering activistssubject to arrest warrants in Hong Kong.“Relevant countries need to respect China’s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong, stop lending support for anti-China elements destabilising Hong Kong, and stop providing a safe haven for fugitives,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyPenny WongHong KongChinaAsia PacificAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Politicians need to catch up | Anne DaviesRead moreEarlier this week, a number of backbencherstried to raise their concerns in caucusabout Minn’s position on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and his decision to oppose the weekend protest across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which was attended byup to 300,000 peoplein pouring rain.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailD’Adam said in his speech on Thursday that he was gagged and then bullied by caucus members. He now faces potential disciplinary action or possibly even expulsion from theLabor partyfor publicly airing matters discussed in caucus.In May last year, Minnssacked D’Adam from his roleas parliamentary secretary for youth justice, after he criticised the actions of state police officers towards pro-Palestinian protesters. At the time, Minns called D’Adam’s comments “absolutely reprehensible”.Speaking out publicly about caucus meetings and criticising the leader is extremely rare in Labor.“Earlier this week in the Labor caucus, I sought to make pointed criticisms of the premier in respect to the issues of Palestine and protest,” D’Adam told parliament.“In the meeting, I was howled down, abused [and] told I should resign from the Labor party. A motion was moved to gag me from speaking. In my entire time in the parliament, I have never witnessed such an event.“No apology has been received for the bullying behaviour I was forced to endure. It is deeply disturbing that the caucus appears incapable of entertaining dissenting views and took the step that it did.”D’Adam said the response “can only confirm in the minds of caucus members that it is best to keep quiet”. He denied making a personal attack on Minns.“My critique of the premier was a political critique,” he said. “It was a critique of the government. It was not a personal attack on the premier as an individual but a criticism ofhis handling of a number of mattersrelating to the issues of the day.”D’Adam said that during the caucus debate, whichGuardian Australia reported on Monday, he could “see the fear in the faces and hear it in the voices of my colleagues”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the challenges that we face as a society require bold government.“The solutions we require are full of political risk, the problems like war, climate catastrophe, dislocating technological change and the growing gulf of inequality are not going to be solved by whispered conversations in quiet corners of government.

Remnant vegetation is important for biodiversity and supports endangered species such as the koala and greater glider.Queensland land clearing by region in hectaresDave Copeman, the director of the QueenslandConservationCouncil, the state’s peak conservation body, said the figures were “shocking”.“Queenslanders and international visitors alike would be distressed to learn that the Queensland government is allowing forests and woodlands to be bulldozed in the Great Barrier Reef catchment at an alarming rate, with over 140,000 hectares being cleared per year,” he said.“This is devastating additional pressure on an already damaged Great Barrier Reef struggling to survive from repeated mass bleaching events. This clearing must stop.”Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterThe Australian Conservation Foundation’s Nathaniel Pelle said the figures showed Queensland “remains the deforestation capital of Australia” and the government needed to tighten regulations.“It is sadly no longer surprising to see big numbers coming out of Queensland when it comes to deforestation but what is most alarming is the jump in destruction of remnant forests and woodland, which is catastrophic for Queensland’s wildlife and proves the state’s vegetation management is not working,” he said.About 86% of the clearing (283,918ha) was for the expansion of pasture and 77% (254,647ha) was category X clearing, which means it did not require a permit under the state’s vegetation management laws. The Brigalow and Mulga Lands regions were clearing hotspots.Thefigures show that 33,000 hectaresof woodland and forest bulldozed was unexplained, which can include potentially unlawful clearing.According to the report, less than 1% (3,040ha) of the total area bulldozed was in places containing endangered ecosystems, but this was 21% more than the previous year, which Copeman said was “distressing”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this was not discussed. The Russian side left this option completely without comment.”No venue was given for the potential bilateral summit but Putin, who was meeting Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the leader of the United Arab Emirates, in the Kremlin, suggested the UAE could be a suitable place to hold the talks. “We have many friends who are willing to help us organise such events. One of our friends is the president of the United Arab Emirates,” he said.The prospect of Putin and Trump trying to come to an agreement on Ukraine with no one else in the room is likely to alarm Kyiv and European capitals, who have consistently said that Ukraine must be present for discussions about its fate.By contrast, Russia favours the idea of a “great powers summit” at which it could try to negotiate with Trump over the heads of Europeans. Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin economic adviser, said the meeting would be a good opportunity to directly talk to Trump to prevent “misinformation” about Russia that other countries were using to influence the US president. The summit could become “an important historic event”, he claimed.Trump called Zelenskyy after Witkoff left Russia on Wednesday. The Nato chief, Mark Rutte, and several European leaders were also on the line.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin welcomes Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff for a meeting in Moscow on Wednesday.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/ReutersOn Thursday, Zelenskyy was careful not to criticise Trump but said he would spend the day speaking with European allies. “We in Ukraine have repeatedly said that the search for real solutions can become truly effective only at the level of leaders. We need to decide on the time for such a format, with a range of issues,” he wrote in a Telegram post.Later, he said he had spoken with the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. “I gave [Macron] our Ukrainian view of the talk between President Trump and European colleagues,” he said. “We are coordinating our positions and we both understand the need for a common European vision of key European security issues.”Zelenskyy has repeatedly called for direct discussions with Putin, with either Trump or the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as a mediator. Putin has so far dismissed the possibility, suggesting that lower-level negotiation groups should come to an agreement first. However, little progress has been made at a series of direct talks in Turkey, with Moscow sending a junior delegation and not appearing ready for real talks.In recent weeks, Trump had appeared to take a tougher line with Moscow for the first time in his presidency, calling continued Russian attacks against civilian targets in Ukraine “disgusting” and promising the introduction of new sanctions ifprogress towards a deal was not madeby a deadline of this Friday.White House officials have said sanctions were still expected and on Wednesday additional tariffs were announced for India, based on the country’s buying of Russian oil. At the same time, however, Trump seemed satisfied with the outcome of Witkoff’s talks.Ushakov said the discussions had been “businesslike” and claimed they focused on a bright future of cooperation between Washington and Moscow. “It was reaffirmed that Russian-US relations could be based on a completely different, mutually advantageous scenario, which drastically differs from how they developed in recent years,” he said.Trump said on Wednesday evening the meeting could happen “very soon”. Some others in Washington seemed less sure. The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said a meeting could take place soon, “but obviously a lot has to happen before that can occur”.If it goes ahead, it would be the first US-Russia leaders’ summit sinceJoe Biden met Putin in Genevain 2021.Explore more on these topicsRussiaVladimir PutinDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkraineEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It comes after weeks of opposition from the left, environmentalists and doctors, and a record-breaking 2m signatures on a petition against a bill that would have allowed a pesticide banned inFrancein 2020 to come back into use.The “Duplomb law” – named after the conservative lawmaker Laurent Duplomb who proposed it – had been presented in parliament as a bid to free up French farmers, who have repeatedly expressed frustration over bureaucratic constraints on the agricultural sector, unfair foreign competition, and what they called stringent regulations, including on pesticides.But in a rebuke of the government on Thursday night, the constitutional council found that the law’s provision to reintroduce acetamiprid – a chemical known to be toxic to pollinators such as bees – did not abide by France’s environmental charter, which guarantees the “right to live in a balanced and healthy environment”. The constitutional authority also raised questions over provisions for water reservoirs in the bill.What has it taken to unite France’s divided voters? A hated, toxic chemical | Alexander HurstRead moreThe president,Emmanuel Macron, had “taken good note of the decision”, his office said on Thursday night, and was expected to swiftly validate the bill without these contested sections.The Green leader, Marine Tondelier, said she was “very relieved” by the verdict. The Socialist party said the verdict was a rebuke to the “irresponsibility of the prime minister, François Bayrou, and his government”.The insecticide in question was particularly sought after by beet and hazelnut growers, who said they had no alternative against pests and faced unfair competition. Some growers also argued that acetamiprid, allowed in other EU countries, was vital to fight virus yellows, which cut yields by 30% in 2020 and slashed sugar output.The petition on the website of France’s lower-house National Assembly called the measure a “frontal attack on public health”. Beekeepers have described the chemical as “a bee killer”, and its effects on humans are also a source of concern, though its risk remains unclear in the absence of large-scale studies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Now is the time to stand together and demand redress,” said Hotrec’s president, Alexandros Vassilikos, calling out “abusive practices in the digital market” in Europe.Booking.com called Hotrec and other hotel associations’ statements “incorrect and misleading” in an emailed statement, adding that it had not received “formal notification of a class action”.It said that the ECJ ruling did not find that Booking.com’s “best price” clauses were anti-competitive but “simply stated that such clauses fall within the scope of EU competition law and that their effects must be assessed on a case-by-case basis”.The company referred to a statement about its “commitment to fair competition”, in which it argued that “past parity clauses served to foster competitive pricing rather than restrict it”.It cited a poll in which74% of hotelierssaid Booking.com made their business more profitable, with many reporting higher occupancy rates and lower customer acquisition costs. However, other industry representatives criticised the company’s practices as extractive.“As they gained control of the market, Booking was able to increase its commission rates and exert much greater pressure on hoteliers’ margins,” Véronique Siegel, president of the hotels division of French hospitality sector association Umih, told public broadcaster France Inter.“For a room that the customer pays €100 (£87) for, if you take away Booking’s commission, the hotelier receives €75 at best, with which they have to pay their employees and invest.”Despite the friction, Booking.com appears unavoidable for many hotels, offering an online reach and visibility hard to achieve for smaller, independent establishments.A study by Hotrec and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerlandfound that Booking Holding, the website’s parent company, controlled 71% of the European market in 2024, compared with 68.4% in 2019.The corporation is valued at$170bn (£127bn), three times that of Volkswagen.Rupprecht Podszun, director of the institute for competition law at Düsseldorf’s Heinrich Heine University, said Booking.com was a classic example of how a digital platform could conquer an entire sector, creating a “winner takes all” dynamic.He said the legal action would probably be protracted and turn on the thorny question of how damages could be measured.“Judges will have to form an opinion and then it will go through all the appeals – everything at great expense and with all the tricks available under the law,” he told Germany’s daily Süddeutsche Zeitung.“The case is a revolt of the hotels, saying: ‘You can’t just do what you want with us.’”Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureEuropeEuropean UnionCourt of justice of the European UnionRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

When the Irish College moved to another location in 1927 there was no sign of the urn.One theory is that it was swept up with other remains during works to expand the Bank ofItaly, which encroached into the church’s crypt, and reinterred at the Campo Verano cemetery. Another theory is that it was transferred to a silver casket that was then targeted by thieves.“What a tragedy to think that the heart of O’Connell could have been swept up and taken and stolen,” a historian, John Crotty, told RTÉ. “But that is the worst-case scenario.

A fixture in the Palestinian national side after his debut in 2007, Obeid gained 24 caps and scored twice, the PFA said, most memorably with a scissor-kick against Yemen during the 2010 West Asian Football Federation championship.His talent on the pitch earned him the nickname of “the Palestinian Pelé” – a nod to the legendary Brazilian widely hailed as one of the greatest players of all time.His death adds to a growing toll of athletes lost in Gaza since the war began, with at least 662 sportspeople and their relatives reported to have been killed.“The number of footballers killed or who died from starvation has reached 421, including 103 children,” the PFA said.Obeid is survived by his wife and five children.According to the PFA, 288 sports facilities have been damaged or reduced to rubble across Gaza and the West Bank, from stadiums and training grounds to gyms and clubhouses. The vast majority, 268, were in Gaza, while 20 were in the West Bank, with about half serving football directly.Among the sites hit was the PFA’s headquarters in Gaza, struck during an Israeli air raid.More than 1,300 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in the vicinity of aid distribution points managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation since the US- and Israeli-backed logistic group’s launch in late May.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

We want to have a security perimeter,” Netanyahu said. “We want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly without threatening us and giving Gazans a good life.”In Gaza, where Israel’s air and ground war has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and caused a famine, Palestinians are braced for further misery. “There is nothing left to occupy,” said Maysaa al-Heila, who is living in a displacement camp. “There is no Gaza left.”Aya Mohammad, a 30-year-old Palestinian who, after repeated displacement, had returned with her family to Gaza City, said: “Where should we go? We have been displaced and humiliated enough.“You know what displacement is? Does the world know? It means your dignity is wiped out, you become a homeless beggar, searching for food, water and medicine.”At least 42 Palestinians were killed in Israeli airstrikes and shootings across southern Gaza on Thursday, according to local hospitals.At a meeting of Israel’s security cabinet on Thursday evening, Netanyahu was hoping to obtain approval for fully controlling the strip, Israeli media reported.Two government sources told Reuters any resolution by the security cabinet would need to be approved by the full cabinet, which may not meet until Sunday.The plan would mean sending ground troops into the few areas of the strip that have not been totally destroyed, roughly 25% of the territory where many of its 2 million people have sought refuge.Israel is reportedly preparing a two-phase operation aimed at seizing control of Gaza City, with plans to evacuate about 1 million residents – half of Gaza’s population – in what officials describe as a temporary measure to establish civilian infrastructure in central Gaza.According to Israel’s Channel 12, the proposal is being framed as a limited operation rather than a full invasion, apparently to placate military chiefs wary of long-term occupation. The chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, has reportedly warned that occupying Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages.View image in fullscreenProtesters urged Netanyahu to show ‘courageous leadership’ and end the war.Photograph: Debbie Hill/UPI/ShutterstockHowever, the operation’s goal – potentially involving up to five IDF divisions and lasting four to five months – suggests a far more extensive campaign. Israeli officials say it aims to pressure Hamas back into negotiations and possibly align with a broader US-led peace framework.Yet many remain sceptical. As one unnamed security official put it: “We are entering a Vietnam model, with our eyes wide open.”Only 1.5% of Gaza cropland left for starving Palestinians due to Israel’s war, UN saysRead moreHamas in a statement called Netanyahu’s comments “a blatant coup” against the negotiation process. “Netanyahu’s plans to escalate the aggression confirm beyond any doubt his desire to get rid of the captives and sacrifice them in pursuit of his personal interests and extremist ideological agenda,” the group said in a statement.Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Al Jazeera the group would treat any force formed to govern Gaza as an “occupying” force linked to Israel.Arab countries would “only support what Palestinians agree and decide on,” a Jordanian official source told Reuters, adding that security in Gaza should be handled through “legitimate Palestinian institutions.”Earlier this year Israel and the United States rejectedan Egyptian proposal, backed by Arab leaders, that envisaged the creation of an administrative committee of independent, professional Palestinian technocrats entrusted with the governance of Gaza after the war.Netanyahu is under intense international pressure to reach a ceasefire agreement, but he also faces pressure from within his coalition to continue the war. Some far-right allies in his government have pushed for a full occupation of Gaza and for Israel to reestablish settlements there, two decades after it withdrew.The far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, told reporters on Wednesday that he hoped the government would approve the military taking control of the rest of Gaza.The World Health Organization said on Thursday that 99 people were known to have died from malnutrition in the Gaza Strip so far this year, with the figure probably an underestimate. Internationaloutrage over the humanitarian situation in Gazahas ratcheted up pressure on Israel, with UN agencies warning of famine.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for scaled-up, sustained and unimpeded aid to be allowed to flow into Gaza, through all possible routes.People in Gaza “have limited access to basic services, have faced repeated displacement and are now suffering from a blockade of food supplies”, he told the UN correspondents’ association ACANU. “Malnutrition is widespread and hunger-related deaths are rising.”In July, nearly 12,000 children under five were identified as suffering from acute malnutrition – the highest monthly figure ever recorded.More than 61,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s assault on Gaza, according to local health officials, though that figure isregarded as a significant underestimate. According to a satellite survey published by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, just1.5% of Gaza’s farmland – less than one square mile – is now accessible and undamaged.Meanwhile, in Israel, the families of the roughly 20 remaining living hostages have called for Israelis to protest against the government and a decision they fear would endanger the lives of their loved ones.On Thursday morning, about 20 family members of those still held captive inGazaboarded boats that departed from the coastal city of Ashkelon, near the border with Gaza, carrying yellow flags and posters bearing the images of the hostages, as they shouted their names.View image in fullscreenFamilies holding pictures of their loved ones and calling for the immediate release of the hostages, during the flotilla near Ashkelon.Photograph: Abir Sultan/EPA“This is the moment for courageous leadership,” the families said, appealing directly to Netanyahu, as well as the lead hostage negotiator, Ron Dermer, and the IDF chief. “Continued obstruction, delay, and failure to bring our loved ones home will be a tragedy for generations. The responsibility is yours. Do not sacrifice our loved ones on the altar of an endless war.”Of the 251 people kidnappedon 7 October 2023, by Hamasand its allies, 49 remain hostages in Gaza, of whom 27 have been declared dead by the army.In the West Bank, Israeli authorities returned the body of the Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleen, who was killed by an Israeli settler last week, after his female Bedouin relatives began a hunger strike to protest the authority’s decision to hold his body in custody. The hunger strike was a rare public call from Bedouin women who traditionally mourn in private. Hathaleen was shot and killed by an Israeli settler during a confrontation caught on video.Additional reporting by Reuters, AFP and Associated PressExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In mid-May, after growing international pressure, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said shipments would restart. However, records from Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls aid shipments into Gaza,show thatthe quantity of aid reaching the territory in May and June fell well below subsistence levels.The writers “call on all people, institutions, governments and states to observe an immediate and complete boycott of all forms of trade, exchange and business with the state of Israel until the people ofGazaare adequately provided with drinking water, food and medical supplies, and until all other forms of relief and necessity are restored to the people of Gaza under the aegis of the United Nations”.Fears for Palestinians and hostages as Netanyahu plans full Gaza occupationRead moreThe letter, which was organised by the writers Horatio Clare and Sean Murray, has 207 signatories, including Laline Paull, Patrick Gale, Michel Faber and Marina Warner. It follows aMay lettersigned by hundreds of writers, also co-organised by Clare, stating that Israel’s attacks on Gaza amount to genocide.The new letter reads: “We make this call because the words and feelings of millions of people and thousands of politicians worldwide have failed to bring about the feeding of the people of Gaza, the protection of civilians or their supply with humanitarian and medical aid.“We regret that this boycott affects a great many individuals and groups in Israel and other countries who share our rejection of the policies of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu; individuals and groups whose pain and compassion for the people of Gaza we share.”The writers propose that the boycott remains in place until the UN declares the civilian population of Gaza “is safe and in receipt of adequate food and aid”.The letter also demands the “return of all hostages and those imprisoned without charge or trial on all sides”, an “end tosettler violenceagainst Palestinians on the West Bank” and “the immediate and permanent ceasefire and cessation of violence by Hamas and Israel”.Campaign groups have been calling for boycotts against Israel for decades, with the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, established in 2005, encouraging economic, cultural and academic boycotts.“We stand in solidarity with the resistance of Palestinian, Jewish and Israeli people to the genocidal policies of the current Israeli government”, the letter states.“We note that prominent and respected Israeli and Jewish groups in Israel and other countries, including many of our fellow writers, have recently called for serious and impactful sanctions on Israeli institutions, to which we add, on, and only on, objectively culpable individuals. A boycott is the only sanction an individual can apply.“In calling for and observing this boycott, we assert without reservation our absolute opposition to and loathing of antisemitism, of anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli prejudice.“We reject and abhor attacks, hate and violence – in writing, speech and action – against Palestinian, Israeli, and Jewish people in all and any form.”The letter concludes: “The children of Gaza, like all children, are the children of all of us, and the future of our world.

Sinha was previously a minister in Modi’s BJP government.According to the directive issued by Jammu and Kashmir’s home ministry on Sinha’s instructions, it had “come to the notice of the government, that certain literature propagates false narrative and secessionism in Jammu and Kashmir”.The 25 books named in the order range from historical narratives of the region by well-known academics, historians and journalists, both from Kashmir and abroad, to documentation of human rights atrocities committed in Kashmir.Hundreds of books seized from stores in Kashmir as Indian police crack down on dissentRead moreJammu and Kashmir is one of the most heavily militarised territories in the world. The Kashmir region has been disputed by Indian and Pakistan since independence, with the two countries controlling parts of it.Since the 1990s, Indian-ruled Kashmir has been home to a militant separatist insurgency and a long-running campaign by Indian forces to crack down on militancy has led to accusations of widespread abuses carried out with impunity including enforced disappearances, tens of thousands of killings and a crushing of freedom of expression under draconian laws. The Indian government has denied the accusations.Roy’s book Azadi, which includes essays on the thousands allegedly killed and disappeared in Kashmir by Indian forces in recent decades, andIndependent Kashmirby the Australian political scientist Christopher Snedden, which explores the Kashmiri fight for independence, were among the banned books.Other titles the government ordered to be banned from publication and forfeited by all bookshops in the region includedColonizing Kashmir: State-building Under Indian Occupation by the US-based academic Hafsa Kanjwal and Contested Lands: Israel-Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Cyprus and Sri Lanka by Sumantra Bose, a professor at the London School of Economics.The government alleged that the content of the books “would deeply impact the psyche of youth by promoting a culture of grievance, victimhood and terrorist heroism”. The order accused the works of glorifying terrorists, distorting history and promoting violence and claimed they had “contributed to the radicalisation of youth in Jammu and Kashmir”.Authors named in the order expressed frustration at their works being censored in the very region they addressed. Angana Chatterji, a scholar at University of California, Berkeley, who co-authored the now-bannedKashmir: The Case for Freedom, said the order “underscores the state’s intent to criminalise scholarship and render it seditious”.“The symbolic and material impact of this ban stands to be extensive,” said Chatterji. “It restimulates psychological operations to terrify and isolate Kashmiris, and silence their pain and resistance.”She alleged that the decree of censorship was part of a wider agenda by the Indian government to “erase the decades-long history of state violence, terror, and impunity in Kashmir”. The order, she added, had “signalled that it fears critique and will not tolerate the free exchange of ideas”.Allegations of attacks on free expression and press freedom in Jammu and Kashmir have mounted since 2019, when the Modi-led government unilaterallystripped Kashmir of its decades-long autonomyand statehood, brought it fully under the control of the central government and began a widespread crackdown on dissent. In February, police in Kashmirraided dozens of bookshopsand seized more than 650 books, alleging they promoted a “banned ideology”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaCensorshipKashmirFreedom of speechArundhati RoySouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

She had been under pressure to explain the contradiction between the stated reason for ending the tenancy and the decision to re-let the home at a higher price after no buyer was found.In a letter to Keir Starmer, theLabourMP said she had “at all times” followed “all legal requirements” and taken her responsibilities “seriously”.But she added: “It is clear that continuing in my role will be a distraction from the ambitious work of the government. I have therefore decided to resign from my ministerial position.”In response, the prime minister thanked Ali for her “diligent work” at the Ministry of Housing,Communitiesand Local Government, saying it would have “a lasting impact”.Starmer swiftly responded to her resignation letter and said: “I know you will continue to support the government from the backbenches and represent the best interests of your constituents in Bethnal Green and Stepney.”Ali had been widely criticised for apparent hypocrisy. She has spoken out against private renters being exploited and said the Labour government would “empower people to challenge unreasonable rent increases”.Therenters’ rights bill, which is due to come into force next year, will ban landlords who have ended a tenancy in order to sell a property from relisting it for a higher rent. The bill will also end the use of fixed-term tenancies.Kevin Hollinrake, the Conservative party chair, accused Starmer of presiding over “a government of hypocrisy and self-service”.He said: “It is right that Rushanara Ali has now quit the government following our calls for her to go.“Keir Starmer promised a government of integrity but has instead presided over a government of hypocrisy and self-service. Once again it’s one rule for Labour and one for everyone else.“With a fourth minister now having to step down in disgrace, it is clear the British public deserve so much better than the endless sleaze and scandal of this Labour government.”Peter Wishart, the Scottish National party’s deputy leader at Westminster, said earlier on Thursday: “Once this shameful story broke, Labour’s homelessness minister should have immediately resigned.”Jess Barnard, a former chair of Young Labour and a member of Labour’s national executive committee, said: “Seems an appropriate time to reiterate MPs should not be landlords and landlords should not be Labour MPs.”Mairi MacRae, the director of campaigns and policy at Shelter, said: “It beggars belief that after months of dither and delay, the government’s own homelessness minister has profited from the underhand tactics the renters’ rights bill is meant to outlaw.“This story serves as a damning reminder that the cards are fundamentally stacked against renters. Unscrupulous landlords cannot be allowed to continue the practice of ‘fire-and-rehire’ evictions, where they slap renters with a section 21 only to hike up the rent a few months later and relet the property at a higher price.”A spokesperson for Ali said on Thursday afternoon: “The tenants stayed for the entirety of their fixed-term contract and were informed they could stay beyond the expiration of the fixed term while the property remained on the market, but this was not taken up and they decided to leave the property.”It is understood that after an end-of-tenancy inventory was carried out, the managing agent requested payment from the tenants to cover the costs of repairs. This was not authorised by Ali and was cancelled after she intervened.The house, near Ali’s Bethnal Green and Stepney constituency, is listed for sale at £894,995. The property was reportedly put up for sale last November and the price was reduced in February.Explore more on these topicsLabourHousingCommunitiesHomelessnessRenting propertyPropertySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

How did it cope with my Yorkshire accent?Leeds MP Mark Sewards has launched a digital assistant, but the results of my chat show MPs’ aides have nowt to worry aboutRobyn VinterNorth of England correspondentThu 7 Aug 2025 15.55 EDTFirst published on Thu 7 Aug 2025 14.03 EDTShareAs anyone with even a trace of a regional dialect who has had to pay a parking fine can attest, voice recognition services struggle with accents. Now, people in Mark Sewards’ constituency inLeedsare likely to find the same problem with his AI variant.A chatbot billed as the first AI version of an MP responds in Sewards’ voice with advice, support or by offering to pass on a message to his team – but only if it understands you.The website, a virtual representation of the MP for Leeds South West and Morley – complete with a Pixar-style cartoon – was launched by a local startup to field questions from his constituents, some of whom have broad Leeds accents.I was interested to see how “Sewardsbot” would handle a conversation with someone from only a couple of miles away from his constituency border.Summoning my “home” voice (the one I had before it was adulterated by university, several years living in London, and many conversations with Guardian colleagues from East Sussex), I begin a conversation.“Hi. I’m AI Mark Sewards,LabourMP for Leeds South West and Morley, can I help you today?” the character says, in Sewards’ voice.“Now then,” I begin. My words appear on the screen, and while the bot doesn’t seem to understand it as a greeting – “now then” means “hello” in most of Yorkshire – it fills the gap in the conversation, asking for my name and contact details.The AI version of Seward records all the conversations, with the aim that his team will be able to pick out the key topics that his constituents are talking about – something it has been criticised for.Speaking of key topics, I go straight in with what is on many people’s minds: the horrendous images and video coming out of Palestine. “Are you gonna do summat about Gaza? Y’ant got it right Mark, love,” I say.Sewardsbot handles this well, understanding that I’m broadly talking about Gaza, though doing nothing to explain the government’s position.A message on the website had warned me: “AI Mark is a prototype digital assistant – this is a work in progress and not everything it says should be taken as fact. All responses are AI-generated.”I try a few other phrases to see if I can throw it off with colloquialisms, asking if someone can call me, but that I’m at work “nine while half five so I can’t be ont’ phone” until after, and telling it I was “chuffed” to have had a chip butty in a nice breadcake in his constituency.Its interpretation of my accent is terrible and much of it is transcribed as unreadable gobbledegook. Unlike a human, it doesn’t understand that the glottal stop used in front of words means “the”, although it manages to get the gist.So I decide to ask the kind of problem a constituency MP might be requested to solve – even if it’s not their responsibility. “Me neighbour’s lad’s blocked’t ginnel at’t back wi an old settee and he won’t do owt about it. If someone dun’t come for it, it’s going in’t road,” I say.I suspect Sewards himself would tell me to contact Leeds city council about flytipping, instead the AI tells me I need to speak to the police to report an abandoned vehicle.MPs’ aides will no doubt be sighing in relief – they’ve got nowt to worry about just yet.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)LeedsLabourLocal politicsLinguisticsComputingLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

They are alarmed by companies gaining “corporate reach” in schools by supplying teacher resource packs and student information sheets that they claim constitute “misleading and harmful classroom materials”.“We wouldn’t let big tobacco teach children about smoking. So why are we allowing the alcohol, gambling and junk food industries into classrooms?” said Chris van Tulleken, a professor of infectious disease and global health at University College London. “Allowing these industries into schools distorts learning and helps industry establish the next generation of customers.”The coalition of 58 health experts, groups and academics wants Phillipson to adopt the same tough approach as the Republic of Ireland. In 2022its government told schoolsnot to use materials in the classroom that had been funded by the alcohol industry or other “parties with conflicts of interest”.Academic studies have found that “self-claimed prevention education programmes … serve the interests of their commercial funders. The materials help to normalise harmful behaviours, omit or misrepresent important risks, and shift responsibility for harm on to individuals, including children and young people, and away from the industries and their practices.”Dr May van Schalkwyk, a research fellow at the University of Edinburgh and expert in corporate tactics, said: “The evidence is clear. Industries whose products are undermining the health and wellbeing of children and young people fund harmful youth education programmes as part of their corporate strategies. Urgent action is needed to prevent this form of influence and conflicts of interest”.The letter highlights examples of how the alcohol, gambling and junk food industries have been gaining influence in schools by supplying sponsored resources.It claims that Smashed, a play about underage drinking sponsored by drinks firm Diageo used in PSHE lessons, contains “cancer misinformation, for instance omitting the most common forms of alcohol-related cancer or suggesting alcohol-related cancers are only associated with heavy drinking”.The letter also alleges that Gamble Aware, an industry-funded charity, has produced “educational materials that promote the industry-favoured idea of ‘responsible gambling’. These introduce young people to gambling products and may facilitate gambling initiations, for example by teaching students how to use a betting slip.”In addition, “in some sixth-form colleges, brands like Costa Coffee and Starbucks have set up entire outlets that sell items packed with sugar”, the letter adds. Zoe Osmond, Gamble Aware’s chief executive, said it commissions “a broad range of independently designed and delivered education programmes, which are evaluated using transparent criteria by independent researchers.“We only ever commission activity aimed to raise awareness of the risks of gambling and direct people to appropriate support and treatment. It is inaccurate and irresponsible to suggest otherwise.”Drinkaware said it no longer sponsors materials for schools. “The education programme referenced in the letter [about how to pour drinks] was wound down in 2019, six years ago and three years before the academic paper cited was published”, a spokesperson said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A small contribution from each charger creates a big saving for the grid,” he said.SNRG is pursuing other similar projects across the country, but Otterpool is the most advanced, Nicholls added.Jim Martin, the leader of Folkestone and Hythe district council, described the plans as “a perfect example of what can be delivered using renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions”.“While the solar park is subject to a planning application, which will of course enable the public to give their views and allow further scrutiny by councillors, the prospect of generating green power on land already owned by the council and at no cost to local taxpayers is very attractive,” he said.Explore more on these topicsRenewable energyKentEnergy (Environment)Energy (Technology)HousingNational GridnewsShareReuse this content"

The government’s limited options were further emphasised this week when the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said“moderate but sustained” tax rises would be neededin the budget for Reeves to overcome a deficit of £41.2bn and restore a near-£10bn buffer.No date has been set for the budget, which was held last year on 30 October, but government sources expect that it will be in November, giving the chancellor a little longer to roll the pitch for controversial tax rises or cuts – as well as hoped-for improvements in growth.Advisers believe that a “no surprises” approach will be crucial to prevent negative market reaction. “Last year was a model of how to do it,” one said. “Had we done it otherwise, it would have been a mess.”Sources pointed towards the early signs Reeves gave to the markets more than a month before her budget last year that she planned to change her fiscal rules around borrowing to invest – and said there would be a similar approach this time.However, Labour was roundly attacked by business leaders afterwards forfailing to warn about a £25bn increasein employer national insurance contributions (NICs), with companies including Tesco and Boots warning that it would raise their costs by £7bn and lead to higher prices and job cuts.View image in fullscreenGordon Brown (left) and Keir Starmer. Brown has advocated spending funds raised from parts of the gambling industry on lifting the two-child benefit cap.Photograph: Jane Barlow/PAStarmer has spent the week in Chequers meeting key aides and ministers as he begins work on his conference speech. The prime minister is understood to be keen to spend much of the summer thinking about the longer-term major structural problems in the UK economy that the party failed to identify before the election: the sources of low economic growth and productivity.Strategists also believe that the budget should be a moment to make the argument that Britain must now make serious choices on growth and productivity. They say Starmer must forcefully rebut the charges that the poor state of the economy is down to individual tax and spend choices, but is a sign of the weakness of the economy’s fundamentals.The budget, they believe, should be a moment to set out the hard road of reforms to tackle those issues.Reeves and Starmer are understood to have agreed some broad principles for the budget and the Treasury will begin to submit ideas to Downing Street towards the end of the month.But sources close to Reeves said she is unmoved on her two main pledges – there will be no rise in income tax, national insurance or VAT and no change to the fiscal rules.One tax rise that is near certain is a change to gambling levies, despite a massive lobbying offensive by the industry. Brown has urged Reeves to spend funds from raising taxes on parts of the gambling industry on lifting the two-child benefit cap, a measure likely to be made even more expensive by higher inflation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, the decision was a close call, with the rate-setting panel for the first time in history holding two votes before reaching its verdict.Andrew Bailey, the Bank’s governor, said: “We’ve cut interest rates today, but it was a finely balanced decision.Interest ratesare still on a downward path, but any future rate cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully.”Reeves sought to claim credit for the cut, as she claimed Labour’s economic management had helped Threadneedle Street to reduce borrowing costs five times from a peak of 5.25% in August last year.“The stability we have brought to the public finances through our plan for change has helped make this possible,” she said.However, the MPC warned tax-raising measures in the chancellor’s first autumn budget had contributed to the rekindling of inflationary pressures hitting shoppers in the pocket across the country.Bailey warned that rising inflation could delay further rate cuts in future. “I do think the path continues to be down,” he said. “[But] the path has become more uncertain because of what we’re seeing.”City investors pared their bets for the timing of future rate cuts, with financial markets expecting a next quarter-point move in February and only one more similar reduction before the end of 2026.Reeves said reducing child poverty was a priority of the government but did not commit that any money from higher gambling levies would be spent on removing the two-child limit. The child poverty taskforce is expected to be released before the budget this autumn.“I talk to Gordon [Brown] regularly, and saw him last week when I was in Scotland,” Reeves said on Thursday. “Like Gordon, I am deeply concerned around the levels of child poverty in Britain. No child should grow up hungry or parents not be able to afford the basics for their family.“On gambling taxes, we’ve already launched a review into gambling taxes. We’re taking evidence on that at the moment, and again, we’ll set out our policies in the normal way, in our budget later this year.”Inside No 10 and the Treasury there was fury at the predictions of a £51bn hole in Reeves’ budget by the NIESR thinktank, which aides say is impossible to calculate at the moment given that the budget could be another four months away.But there are fears in other parts of government about how boxed in the government has become, when Reeves has also appeared to rule out a wealth tax. “I am at a loss really how they square the circle,” one Whitehall source said. “It will have to be salami slicing small pieces here and there, when what we should do is bite the bullet.”At the Bank of England’s press conference on Thursday, the MPC singled out fast-rising food prices as it warned that food price inflation was on track to reach 5.5% before the end of the year. It attributed much of the rise to global factors, including increasingly extreme weather events hitting cocoa and coffee harvests, highlighting the dangers from the climate emergency.However, it also pointed to “material” rises in employment costs and new charges for recycling packaging, both driven by the government, that were being passed on to shoppers by UK supermarkets.“In addition to global agricultural commodity prices, domestic labour costs are currently an important driver of food price inflation,” the Bank said.Business leaders had warned that Reeves’s £25bn increase in employer NICs and a 6.7% rise in the “national living wage” from April would force them to cut jobs and put up prices.Official figures show unemployment has crept higher in recent months, while the economy shrank in April and May.Inflationhas also risen by more than expected, reaching 3.6% in June.Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingRachel ReevesInterest ratesEconomicsEconomic policyBank of EnglandKeir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The FBI declined to comment. An administration official told NBC News this week the government did not plan on using federal agents to arrest Texas lawmakers and a federal law enforcement official told the outlet that as of Thursday morning, the agency had not assisted with tryingto locate the lawmakers. None of the lawmakers have been charged with a crime.“Using federal law enforcement to track down political opposition is the tactic of a collapsing regime,” said the Texas state representative John Bucy, one of the lawmakers who is staying in Illinois. “It’s the kind of authoritarian overreach we condemn in other countries. Now, it’s happening here.”Involving federal agents would set up an extraordinary confrontation between the blue state leaders shielding the Democratic lawmakers and theTrump administration.Speaking to reporters at the Illinois state fair on Thursday, the Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, said he welcomed the FBI to the state.“I hope they take in the state fair, I hope they go see the beauty of Lake Michigan. But they won’t be arresting anyone because there is no US federal law that prohibits those Texas house Democrats from being here in the state,” he told reporters.Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the US House, called it an effort to intimidate Democrats.“Shouldn’t the FBI be tracking down terrorists, drug traffickers and child predators? TheTrump administrationcontinues to weaponize law enforcement to target political adversaries. These extremists don’t give a damn about public safety. We will not be intimidated,” he said in a post on X.Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, also accused Cornyn, who is locked in a primary battle against Texas’s attorney general, Ken Paxton, of grandstanding. “John Cornyn is desperately swinging for the fences, asking Kash Patel to take a break from covering up forDonald Trumpto instead pull this political stunt. They both know damn well that legally, there’s nothing they can do,” he said.Legal expertshave questionedhow the federal law enforcement agency could play a role in returning the lawmakers.“Federal government intrusion into a state’s process of self-government should only occur when there is a clear constitutional warrant. In this situation, the federal government has no authority to intervene and no legitimate role to play,” said David Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Houston.In his request for assistance to the FBI earlier this week, Cornyn said he was “concerned that legislators who solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses”. Trump also suggested earlier this week that the FBI might have to get involved in the matter.Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has also launched a long-shot legal effort to get the top Democrat who left, Gene Wu, removed from office.Paxton, the Texas attorney general,also announced on Wednesdayhe had launched an investigation into a group run by former congressman Beto O’Rourke that has been covering the costs of Texas lawmakers as they remain in Illinois. Each lawmaker that breaks quorum is fined $500 per day.Also on Thursday,JD Vancemet with Republican lawmakers inIndianato encourage them to redraw the state’s congressional map to be more favorable to the GOP, the latest in a brazen nationwide push to reconfigure district lines ahead of next year’s midterm elections.Republicansalready control seven of Indiana’s nine congressional seats, but the party has complete control of state government, which could allow them to redraw the map to pick up more seats.Donald Trumpis also pushing Missouri to redraw its congressional map to add more GOP seats and Republicans in Ohio, where Republicans already control 10 of 15 districts, are also likely to reconfigure their map later this year to add more Republican seats.Vance met with Indiana’s Republican governor, Mike Braun, and state legislative leaders on Thursday. To redraw the maps inIndiana, Braun would need to call a special session.Republicans have anextremely slim marginin the US House and Democrats need to net just three seats to flip control of Congress next year. The president’s party typically loses US House seats in a midterm election, which is why Republicans are pushing to redraw districts in their favor.During a conference call on Thursday, two of four Texas lawmakers who had been scheduled to speak were delayed by taking a security briefing in light of the report of FBI involvement in the quorum break. Legislators deflected questions about the risk of a conflict between state and federal law enforcement, redirecting questions toward flooding relief and Abbott’s legislative and executive priorities.“We wouldn’t need to have a quorum break and wouldn’t need to be scared of the constitutional breakdown of states’ rights, and Illinois law enforcement versus the FBI, if we were focusing on the things that matter,” said the Texas representative Mary Gonzalez. “To me, the thing that matters most is that over 100 people died and that the homes are still destroyed and that people are still living in unsafe communities because there is debris.”The governors of California and New York, where Democrats have complete control of state government, have pledged to retaliate against Republicans’ redistricting efforts by adding Democratic seats, though both states facelegal requirementsthat make aggressive gerrymandering more difficult.Additional reporting by George ChidiExplore more on these topicsRepublicansJD VanceIndianaMissouriOhioTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

That energy department report wasslammed by scientistsfor being a “farce” full of misinformation.Speaking to CNN this week about the national climate assessment reports, Wright claimed they “weren’t fair in broad-based assessments of climate change”. He added: “When you get into departments and look at stuff that’s there and you find stuff that’s objectionable, you want to fix it,” he said.In recent weeks the Trump administration deleted the website that hosted the periodic, legally mandated, national climate assessments (themost recent report is hosted on the Guardian websiteand can be read in full here).Asked about Wright’s comments on the national climate assessment reports, respected climate scientist Michael Mann said in an emailed comment to the Guardian: “This is exactly what Joseph Stalin did.”In a statement on Thursday, Dr Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and one of the authors of the sixth NCA report due in 2028 that the administrationdismissed earlier this year, said she was dismayed by Wright’s comments.“Secretary Wright just confirmed our worst fears – that this administration plans to not just bury the scientific evidence but replace it with outright lies to downplay the worsening climate crisis and evade responsibility for addressing it.“The process for developing the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment reports is rigorous, with federal agencies and hundreds of scientists constructing this solid scientific foundation that decision makers, businesses and the public rely on to stay safe in a world made more perilous each day by climate change.“People across the country are already reeling from climate-fueled worsening heatwaves, floods, wildfires and storms. Lying about that reality doesn’t change it; it just leaves people in harm’s way. We urge Congress to intervene to safeguard the integrity of the NCA reports so they remain vital, lifesaving tools in the fight against climate change.”The NCA reports are published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNN that Wright was “not suggesting he personally would be altering past reports”.In May, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union said they would join forces to produce peer-reviewed research on the climate crisis’s impact after the NCA contributors for the 2028 publication were dismissed.The energy department’s climate report last week was published on the same day the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposal to undo the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which allows the agency to limit planet-heating pollution from cars and trucks, power plants and other industrial sources.This raised concerns that the Trump administration was attempting toscrap almost all pollution regulationsin steps likely to trigger battles in the courts in the coming years.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationClimate crisisClimate sciencenewsShareReuse this content"

It could open up a vast new funding source to managers of so-called alternative assets outside stocks, bonds and cash, though critics say it also could bring too much risk into retirement investments. Such a move would be a boon for big alternative asset managers by opening the $12tn market for retirement funds, known as defined contribution plans, to their investments.Trump’s executive order is part of hisadministration’sbroader embrace of the cryptocurrency lobby and rollback of regulations on digital currencies. Formerly askeptic about cryptowho said bitcoin “seemed like a scam”, Trump has this year launched his own lucrativecryptocurrency enterprise, courted crypto supporters and promised to make the US into the “crypto capital of the world”.“A combination of regulatory overreach and encouragement of lawsuits filed by opportunistic trial lawyers has stifled investment innovation,” Trump said in the order. “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers’ retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement.”There is concern among some analysts that allowing cryptocurrency to be included in 401(k) contributions carries a high degree of risk, however, given that crypto is inherently speculative and in recent years has been the subject of rampant fraud.“Opening up the $9tn 401(k) industry to alternative assets overall is reasonable, but if these assets and sectors are highly speculative and underregulated, it could be a big mistake,” said Anil Khurana, executive director of Georgetown University’s Baratta Center for Global Business.Trump also issued a separate executive order on Thursday targeting the alleged “debanking” of conservatives, promoting a longstanding rightwing grievance that banks refused them access to their services on political grounds. Prominent Silicon Valley investors took up the issue over the past year as part of a push to ease regulatory scrutiny of crypto assets.The order on 401(k) contributions directs the labor secretary to consult with her counterparts at the treasury department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other federal “regulators to determine whether parallel regulatory changes should be made at those agencies”, aWhite House statementsaid.The new investment options carry lower disclosure requirements and are generally less easy to sell quickly for cash than the publicly traded stocks and bonds that most retirement funds rely on. Investing in them also tends to carry higher fees and, in the case of cryptocurrency, exposes retirees to a market known for its volatility.In defined contribution plans, employees make contributions to their own retirement account, frequently with a matching contribution from their employer. The invested funds belong to the employee, but unlike a defined benefit pension plan, there is no guaranteed regular payout upon retirement.Whatever changes may come from Trump’s order, it likely will not happen overnight, private equity executives say. Plaintiffs’ lawyers are already preparing for lawsuits that could be filed by investors who do not understand the complexity of the new forms of investments.The world’s largest asset manager, which lobbied for the change, is not waiting. BlackRock plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year. However, CEO Larry Fink acknowledged in a recent call with analysts that the change may not be an immediate boon for the industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s a lot of issues related to the defined contribution business,” Fink said. “And this is why the analytics and data are going to be so imperative way beyond just the inclusion.”The Department of Labor issued guidance during Trump’s previous presidency on how such plans could invest in private equity funds within certain limits, but few took advantage, fearing litigation.Proponents argue that younger savers can benefit from potentially higher returns on riskier investments in funds that get more conservative as they approach retirement.Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren wrote in June to the chief executive of annuity provider Empower Retirement, which oversees $1.8tn in assets for more than 19 million investors, asking how retirement savings placed in private investments could be safeguarded “given the sector’s weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns”.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationCryptocurrenciesUS retirementDonald TrumpUS politicsUS personal financenewsShareReuse this content"

The president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said the duties were “unacceptable blackmail”.Switzerland said it was seeking new talks with the US after a last-gasp mission to Washington by its president, Karin Keller-Sutter, failed to stop a 39% tariff blow that industry group Swissmem described as a “horror scenario”.In a statement after an emergency meeting with Keller-Sutter, the Swiss cabinet said the tariffs would “place a substantial strain on Switzerland’s export-oriented economy”.“For the affected sectors, companies and their employees, this is an extraordinarily difficult situation,” Keller-Sutter told reporters.Taiwan is also continuing talks with the US. Its president, Lai Ching-te, said the 20% rate imposed on the key Washington ally was “temporary”.Ireland, which is locked into an EU-US deal setting the tariff ceiling at 15%, said it would publish a new plan for diversifying an economy that relies heavily on US multinationals including Intel, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, all in Trump’s crosshairs.Despite a last minute reprieve from Trump for Lesotho with tariffs dropping from 50% to 15%, the impoverished African nation said it was already hurting.Textile industry players in the country – which produces jeans and other garments for US companies including Levi and Walmart – said the uncertainty around tariffs over the past few months had already devastated the sector, with orders cancelled and jobs cut.Laos, which, like Brazil and Myanmar, was hit with a 40% rate, was among those handed a steep increase in import duties because of a trade imbalance with the US.“A 40% tariff is just a nail in the coffin for any industry trying to ship to the United States,” Johannes Somers, the executive chair of the garment manufacturing firm Diep Vu, told Agence France Presse.“We estimate about 20,000 workers or more could be impacted,” added Xaybandith Rasphone, the head of the Association of the Lao Garment Industry.The sweeping “reciprocal” rates wereannounced by the White House a week ago, just before a previous 1 August deadline was due to elapse.Just before the tariffs came into effect at midnight, Trump claimed on social media that billions of dollars would start flowing into the US as a result.However, while the customs duties make countries’ exports more expensive and less competitive, they are payable on import and usually passed on to the customer.“The only thing that can stop America’s greatness would be a radical left court that wants to see our country fail,” the president wrote in capital letters, referencing an ongoingcase in the US court of appeals, which is considering whether he exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs.Some trading partners had already secured reductions through negotiations or by striking deals, including the UK, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and the EU.Toyota warns of £7.1bn hit from Trump tariffs as it cuts profit forecastRead moreThe EU is the only trading partner whereits baseline rate of 15%will include previous tariffs. It means, for example, cheeses that are normally hit with import duties of 14.9% will be taxed at 15% and not 29.9%.However, the deal has only been implemented in part with tariffs of 27.5% still being imposed on EU car imports while the details of the US-EU deal are being finalised.Hildegard Müller, the president of the German car industry federation, said the EU-US deal had “brought no clarity or improvement” to the industry.“The sectoral tariffs on cars and automotive parts of 27.5%, which have been in effect since April and May respectively, remain in place and place a significant burden on German automakers and automotive suppliers, as well as on transatlantic trade.“It is important that the promised agreement is reached now and the relief measures are implemented promptly,” she said.India’s 25% tariff rate could rise to a total of 50% after Trump signed an executive order on Wednesdayimposing an additional levyin retaliation for the country’s purchase of oil from Russia. Delhi has 21 days to respond. Trump has threatened to use the same tactic on other countries that supply Russia.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTariffsLuiz Inácio Lula da SilvaIndiaIrelandSwitzerlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Miran, if approved by the Senate, will serve until 31 January 2026.The appointment is Trump’s first opportunity to exert more control over the Fed, one of the few remainingindependent federal agencies. Trump has relentlessly criticized the current chair,Jerome Powell, for keeping short-terminterest ratesunchanged, calling him “a stubborn MORON” last week on social media.Trump says treasury chief Scott Bessent no longer being considered for Fed chairRead moreMiran has been a strong defender of Trump’s income tax cuts and tariff hikes, arguing that the combination will generate enough economic growth to reduce budget deficits. He also has played down the risk of Trump’s tariffs generating higher inflation, a major source of concern for Powell.The choice of Miran may heighten concerns about political influence over the Fed, which has traditionally been insulated from day-to-day politics. Fed independence is generally seen as key to ensuring that it can take difficult steps to combat inflation, such as raising interest rates, which politicians might be unwilling to take.Federal Reserve governors vote on all the central bank’s interest-rate decisions, as well as its financial regulatory policies.Miran’s nomination, if approved, would add a near-certain vote in support of lower interest rates. Kugler had echoed Powell’s view that the Fed should keep rates unchanged and further evaluate the impact of tariffs on the economy before making any moves.At its most recent meeting last week Fed officials kept their key rate unchanged at 4.3%, where it has stood after three rate cuts late last year. But two Fed governors – Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman – dissented from that decision. Both were appointed by Trump in his first term.Still, even with Miran on the board, many of the 12 Fed officials who vote on interest rate policy remain concernedthat Trump’s sweeping tariffs could push inflation higher in the coming months.After the July jobs report was released last Friday, Miran criticized the Fed chair for not cutting benchmark interest rates, saying that Trump had been proven correct on inflation during his first term and would be again. The president has pressured Powell to cut short-term interest rates under the belief that his tariffs will not fuel higher inflationary pressures.“What we’re seeing now in real time is a repetition once again of this pattern where the president will end up having been proven right,” Miran said on MSNBC. “And the Fed will, with a lag and probably quite too late, eventually catch up to the president’s view.”Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Unfortunately the economics made it a challenge for us to keep going.”Cheeks added that as soon as Taylor Tomlinson, the 31-year-old former host of After Midnight, declined to return for another season in the slot formerly occupied by the Late Late Show with James Corden, he knew the network “couldn’t stay in that daypart”.‘A warning signal’: is this the beginning of the end for late-night comedy?Read more“I know [Skydance] is going to invest, but they’re going to invest cautiously and wisely,” he said, indicating a focus on primetime and sports.Many had criticized the decision to cancel Colbert during a crucial window in the merger of Paramount and Skydance, which depended on approval from the Trump administration to proceed. The cancellation came just two days after Colbert publicly criticized his parent company’s settlement with Trump over a “frivolous” lawsuit regarding a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. During one of his monologues, Colbert referred to the $16m paid by Paramount to Trump a “big fat bribe” to approve the $8.4bn merger.Colbert’s announcement that his show would end next year was met with anoutpouring of support from celebrities, as well asspeculationthat the decision was another effort by Paramount to appease Trump as well as the Skydance head, Larry Ellison, who has close ties with the president.But Cheeks said the decision was financial, following reports that the Late Show, which premiered in August 1993 with David Letterman as host, was losing upwards of $40m a year. The late-night genre as a whole has faced significant financial challenges in recent years, with ad revenue plummeting 50% from just seven years ago. Cheeks declined to confirm how much the Late Show was losing, even as the ratings leader in the field for close to a decade, but said it was “significant” and in the “tens of millions of dollars”.“At the end of the day, it just wasn’t sustainable to continue,” he said.Cheeks, who came up in late night at NBC, also said that the timing for the decision came down to contract renewals for crew, including writers and producers. “We were at a period from a production standpoint where every year seasonally, this is [when] we negotiate new deals for writers and producers,” he said. “In addition, this is going to be the third season of Colbert’s three-year deal. So, in order to do those deals, we were going to have to change the terms from what we traditionally are, September to August, to September to May.“It was it incumbent upon me and us to make it clear to Stephen and his reps that this is where we were,” he added, noting that it was “too early to speculate” on what might replace the program in the 11.35pm ET time slot.Colbert will continue to host the show four nights a week until April 2026.Explore more on these topicsStephen ColbertUS televisionCBSTelevisionTV comedyComedyTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

During the Covid-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to an overall uptick in inflation.Trump and Cook were meeting on Wednesday to discuss an agreement forApple to invest $100bnin manufacturing in the US over the next four years. That comes after the iPhone maker already pledged to invest $500bn domestically earlier this year. With Apple’s new investment, the total figure is now at $600bn.Apple has been propped up as an example of a tech company that’s based in the US but conducts much of its manufacturing abroad. The vast majority of Apple’s products are made in China, for example, with about90% of iPhones assembled there. Cook has met with Trump several times since the president took office to discuss more manufacturing in the US.The world’s largest contract maker of chips, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), was “exempt” from the tariff, an official told a parliamentary briefing in Taipei on Thursday. South Korea’s top trade envoy, Yeo Han-koo, said that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix would also not be subject to the 100% levy.Nvidia, one of the largest chipmakers in the US, would likely be exempt from the tariff because the company has manufacturing facilities in the US. Inquiries sent to Nvidia and chipmaker Intel were not immediately answered.However, the plan could be harm other countries in Asia, with the president of the Semiconductor & Electronics Industries in the Philippines Foundation, Dan Lachica, saying that with about 70% of the country’s exports being semiconductors, the new rules would be “devastating”.Demand for computer chips has been climbing worldwide, with sales increasing 19.6% in the year ended in June, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization.Trump’s tariff threats mark a significant break from existing plans to revive computer chip production in the United States. He is choosing an approach that favors the proverbial stick over carrots in order to incentivize more production. Essentially, the president is betting that higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for mobile phones, TVs and refrigerators.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the fifth reduction in a year and takes rates back to where they were in March 2023.Will my mortgage get cheaper?For the vast majority of borrowers the answer is no: more than 7.1m (85%) of Britain’s 8.4m existing residential mortgages are on a fixed rate, which means monthly repayments will stay the same.However, the reduction will translate into lower borrowing costs for the 590,000 homeowners with a base-rate tracker mortgage. The rate they pay will fall, in line with the Bank’s cut. The banking body UK Finance reckons a typical tracker-mortgage customer (with an outstanding balance of just under £140,000) will see monthly payments fall by £28.97 as a result of Thursday’s decision.The 540,000 borrowers on their lender’s standard variable rate (SVR) will have to wait and see. Although it is likely that lenders will reduce their SVRs, they are not obliged to do so. The average amount outstanding on an SVR mortgage is smaller, so UK Finance estimates a typical saving of £13.87 a month if lenders follow the Bank’s cut in full.About 900,000 fixed-rate mortgage deals are due to end in the second half of this year. Depending on what happens with mortgage rates, those coming off five-year deals could face a big jump in payments when they switch to a new product.What about savings rates?The returns on savings are generally not explicitly tied to thebase rate, but Thursday’s reduction is likely to be passed on to many savers who have easy-access accounts and or other accounts without fixed interest rates.On Thursday morning, before the rate cut, the average easy-access savings rate was 2.67%.The “best buy” easy-access accounts pay a lot more than that. Top payers include the savings and investment app Chip and the bank Chase, which at the time of writing had accounts paying 5.1% and 5% (both these rates are bolstered by bonuses).Fixed-rate savings bonds involve tying up your money for between six months and five years, and typically offer some of the highest rates. On Thursday morning the average rate on a one-year, fixed-rate savings deal was 3.99%, according to Moneyfacts.At the time of writing, top-paying one-year fixed-rate bonds such as those offered by Union Bank of India (UK) and Vanquis Bank were paying a rate of 4.47% and 4.44% respectively.What does the rate drop mean for new mortgage deals?Earlier this year there was a mortgage price war, with lots of lenders cutting the cost of their new fixed-rate deals.Things have calmed down a little, though the typical cost of a new deal is still on a downward trend: on Thursday morning, the average five-year, fixed-rate deal was priced at 5.01%, while the average new two-year fix was at 5%, the data firmMoneyfactssaid. At the start of June these were at 5.09% and 5.12% respectively.graphThis is the first time since September 2022 that the average two-year rate has dipped below its five-year counterpart and indicates something of a “return to normality” for home loans. It was always traditionally more expensive to secure a longer-term fixed mortgage.“Mortgage rates have been edging lower in recent weeks,” says Nicholas Mendes​, at the broker John Charcol, adding: “We’ve started to see a handful of five- and two-year fixed rates priced below 3.8%.”At the time of writing there were two-year fixed-rate deals aimed at homebuyers available from Santander and NatWest priced at 3.73% and 3.77%, for those able to stump up a big deposit.For the borrowers whose sub-2% deals are coming to an end this year and who will need to take out a new product, the gap between old and new repayments is still significant, “but it’s narrowing”, says Mendes. “The payment shock is nowhere near what we were seeing 12 to 18 months ago.”Should I go for a fixed-rate or a tracker mortgage?Most experts expect more interest rate cuts, butthe split vote at the Bank of Englandhas changed the outlook a bit. On Thursday morning, the financial markets were anticipating a further quarter-point reduction (in addition to Thursday’s) by the end of the year and then another one by next June.After details of how the monetary policy committee’s 5-4 split vote emerged, the markets trimmed their expectations: they now expect a further quarter-point cut by next February and one more in November next year.That changed outlook is worse for mortgage borrowers hoping for lower rates. Some buyers and those remortgaging may now lean towards a base-rate tracker so that they can benefit from lower payments in future.However, as well as offering certainty, fixed rates are also typically cheaper than trackers at the moment.“Two- and five-year deals are very closely priced. Some borrowers want flexibility if rates fall again, while others prefer the certainty of locking in for longer,” says Mendes. “It’s less about timing the market and more about what fits your plans.”Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesMortgagesSavingsMortgage ratesSavings ratesBanks and building societiesBank of EnglandexplainersShareReuse this content"

Now is the time to stand together and demand redress,” said Hotrec’s president, Alexandros Vassilikos, calling out “abusive practices in the digital market” in Europe.Booking.com called Hotrec and other hotel associations’ statements “incorrect and misleading” in an emailed statement, adding that it had not received “formal notification of a class action”.It said that the ECJ ruling did not find that Booking.com’s “best price” clauses were anti-competitive but “simply stated that such clauses fall within the scope of EU competition law and that their effects must be assessed on a case-by-case basis”.The company referred to a statement about its “commitment to fair competition”, in which it argued that “past parity clauses served to foster competitive pricing rather than restrict it”.It cited a poll in which74% of hotelierssaid Booking.com made their business more profitable, with many reporting higher occupancy rates and lower customer acquisition costs. However, other industry representatives criticised the company’s practices as extractive.“As they gained control of the market, Booking was able to increase its commission rates and exert much greater pressure on hoteliers’ margins,” Véronique Siegel, president of the hotels division of French hospitality sector association Umih, told public broadcaster France Inter.“For a room that the customer pays €100 (£87) for, if you take away Booking’s commission, the hotelier receives €75 at best, with which they have to pay their employees and invest.”Despite the friction, Booking.com appears unavoidable for many hotels, offering an online reach and visibility hard to achieve for smaller, independent establishments.A study by Hotrec and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerlandfound that Booking Holding, the website’s parent company, controlled 71% of the European market in 2024, compared with 68.4% in 2019.The corporation is valued at$170bn (£127bn), three times that of Volkswagen.Rupprecht Podszun, director of the institute for competition law at Düsseldorf’s Heinrich Heine University, said Booking.com was a classic example of how a digital platform could conquer an entire sector, creating a “winner takes all” dynamic.He said the legal action would probably be protracted and turn on the thorny question of how damages could be measured.“Judges will have to form an opinion and then it will go through all the appeals – everything at great expense and with all the tricks available under the law,” he told Germany’s daily Süddeutsche Zeitung.“The case is a revolt of the hotels, saying: ‘You can’t just do what you want with us.’”Explore more on these topicsTravel & leisureEuropeEuropean UnionCourt of justice of the European UnionRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

So why has it got into bed with Donald Trump?Commissioner Gary Bettman and Panthers captain Matthew Tkachuk are on the US president’s sports council. It’s hardly a sign of social progressColin HorganThu 7 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 07.45 EDTShare“Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are critically important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the NHL’s first – and only, so far –diversity and inclusion report, which it released in 2022. “Recognizing these facts, we are working to better understand and accelerate our engagement across all layers of diversity – including nationality, race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, and religion – and their nuances and intersections,” Bettman continued.Last week,Bettman was namedalongside NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, Florida Panthers’ captain Matthew Tkachuk and various representatives of other sports as a member of Donald Trump’s sports council. The council will be responsible for – among other things – playing an “important role in restoring tradition to college athletics, including … keeping men out of women’s sports.” Not what you’d call an opportunity for Bettman et al to gain a better understanding of the nuances of gender identity, by the sounds of it.This is not the first time Bettman has given mixed messages around social issues. In 2023, for example, the NHLtried to host a career fairaimed at recruiting a more diverse workforce (its inclusivity report noted that the league’s employees were roughly 84% white and 93% straight). The event, attached to that year’s All Star Game in Florida, quickly caught the attention of the governor’s office, which accused the NHL of discrimination – against white people. The league cancelled the career fair.A few weeks later, the NHL again had the opportunity to stand for its diversity values when a handful of players refused to wear their team’s Pride-themed warmup jerseys. Instead, the NHL retreated meekly, encouraging “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues.” That June – Pride month, no less – Bettman cancelled the Pride jerseys altogether,callingthe furor around them “a distraction” from the intended message.One wonders what he will call his own foray directly into the culture wars or, for that matter, how the NHL may characterize this particular moment of self-expression from the commissioner. It’s likely that Bettman’s participation in Trump’s sports council will fall into the “voices and perspectives on social and cultural issues” category the league talked about during the Pride jerseys fiasco. But seeing as Trump seems fixated on getting trans women out of college sports – even though there arefewer than 10transgender athletes in college sports, according to the president of the NCAA – this feels like a very specific kind of perspective on a cultural issue, doesn’t it?What’s so aggravating about repeated allowances for anti-LGBTQ+ perspectives from theNHLunder the guise of simply letting all opinions flourish equally, is how it pretends that these views are all morally equivalent when they’re not. Sure, the players who refused to wear a Pride-themed jersey can’t be forced to wear them, but it’s not like it was simply a fashion choice. Fundamentally, those players made that decision based on a worldview that refuses to accept LGBTQ+ people, including their fellow hockey players, as being equal to them and everyone else. It’s not the jerseys that were the problem – but they did a great job highlighting it.Earlier this spring, Harrison Browne, the first transgender player in professional hockey, wrote that while in the NCAA, he was offered the option to have his own locker room and change his pronouns on the roster. “Looking back, I realize how important it is for trans and non-binary student athletes to have those options, whether or not they take them,”Browne wrotein The Walrus. “These choices provide a baseline of institutional acceptance and acknowledgment for gender-diverse athletes at all levels.” On Monday, Browne told the Guardian via email that “to see [Bettman, Gretzky, and Tkachuk] get behind an administration that is targeting marginalized communities, especially trans people in sports, is deeply disturbing and a huge step backwards in making hockey a more inclusive sport.”And going backwards really isn’t Bettman’s thing, or it never used to be. When he accepted his job as commissioner in 1992, hetold a room full of reportersthat “the way a league performs well is by making its product as attractive as it can to the greatest number of fans.” He believed in growth, in other words – even up until 2022. What he risks now is stagnation, regression even. On that same day in 1992,Bettman saidthat he wanted to make hockey, a sport that at the time was seen as violent and retrograde, more “user-friendly.” And he acknowledged that to do it, he’d need to push some of the older owners into the future. “It may be that we are going to head in new, progressive directions that will make sense to every one immediately,” Bettman said. “For some, it may take a little more time.”Maybe the diversity and inclusion stuff doesn’t totally make sense to Bettman in 2025 – other North American sports have decided that they don’t have the stomach to fightthe culture wars under Trump either, and NFL commission Roger Goodell is also on the White House sports council. But Bettman should give the league’s diversity policies time to grow, rather than deliberately reversing course, hurting hockey’s players and fans, and ultimately jeopardising the future success of the sport for everyone. If that’s too much to ask, at the very least, if he’s invited to join a club created by a hostile and retrograde president, he should by now have the smarts to just say no.Explore more on these topicsNHLDonald TrumpTrump administrationIce hockeyUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A fixture in the Palestinian national side after his debut in 2007, Obeid gained 24 caps and scored twice, the PFA said, most memorably with a scissor-kick against Yemen during the 2010 West Asian Football Federation championship.His talent on the pitch earned him the nickname of “the Palestinian Pelé” – a nod to the legendary Brazilian widely hailed as one of the greatest players of all time.His death adds to a growing toll of athletes lost in Gaza since the war began, with at least 662 sportspeople and their relatives reported to have been killed.“The number of footballers killed or who died from starvation has reached 421, including 103 children,” the PFA said.Obeid is survived by his wife and five children.According to the PFA, 288 sports facilities have been damaged or reduced to rubble across Gaza and the West Bank, from stadiums and training grounds to gyms and clubhouses. The vast majority, 268, were in Gaza, while 20 were in the West Bank, with about half serving football directly.Among the sites hit was the PFA’s headquarters in Gaza, struck during an Israeli air raid.More than 1,300 Palestinians are reported to have been killed in the vicinity of aid distribution points managed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation since the US- and Israeli-backed logistic group’s launch in late May.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Definitely caught me off guard,” O’Ward said Wednesday. “I was just a little bit shocked at the coincidences of that and, you know, of what it means ... I don’t think it made a lot of people proud, to say the least.”The post on Tuesdayincluded an AI-generated image of a IndyCar-style vehicle with O’Ward’s No 5 that has “ICE” stamped on it. In the image, the car is in front of a jail.Indiana is home to Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and is where the IndyCar Series is based.“We were unaware of plans to incorporate our imagery as part of yesterday’s announcement,” IndyCar said in a statement Wednesday. “Consistent with our approach to public policy and political issues, we are communicating our preference that our IP not be utilized moving forward in relation to this matter.”A DHS spokesperson said it would not change the social media post. “An AI generated image of a car with ‘ICE’ on the side does not violate anyone’s intellectual property rights. Any suggestion to the contrary is absurd,” the spokesperson said in statement. “DHS will continue promoting the ‘Speedway Slammer’ as a comprehensive and collaborative approach to combatting illegal immigration.”O’Ward said he didn’t see the post until a friend texted him about it. “I haven’t really read into it too much because I don’t think I want to,” he said.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a separate post used “SpeedwaySlammer” when announcing the new partnership with the state of Indiana to expand detention space by 1,000 beds.O’Ward, who was born in Monterrey, Mexico, is second in points in the IndyCar standings, though Alex Palou can clinch the title as early as this weekend in Portland.Explore more on these topicsIndycarUS immigrationMotor sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The same is true of David Moyes’s attempts to build a new team to realise those ambitions.Evertonmust hope that, like Hill Dickinson Stadium, their exhaustive efforts eventually pay off.The feel around Everton is at odds with the reality of Moyes’s summer at present. The move toa modern new home– which, despite Unesco’s objections, is the finest development along the River Mersey in decades – has generated a positivity unfamiliar to Evertonians after too long in the doldrums. But it is not the only source. A blessed end to the Farhad Moshiri era, stability and common sense under The Friedkin Group, the team’s uplift under Moyes in the second half of last season, Moyes himself, with his ability to rebuild a side and connection to the fanbase, all point to a club turning their troubles around and moving forward. But the squad? Not so much.Everton took 31 points from 19 league games under Moyes last season, a dramatic improvement on the 17 from 19 collected in the fag end of Sean Dyche’s reign. Extrapolated across the campaign, Everton’s form under the returning Scot would have been good enough to finish eighth. That, in Moyes’s view, is where Everton should be aiming next and the bare minimum for a club of this stature. He want European qualification and an end to the club’s 30-year trophy drought, not a modest step to mid-table.But nine members of last season’s first team squad departed this summer – many with considerable Premier League experience – and attempts to replace and upgrade them have been largely frustrated. Moyes, now part of a football leadership team that shapes recruitment, has missed out on numerous targets with first-choice options deterred by the lack of European football and too many recent scrapes with relegation. It doesn’t promise to be a hectic end to the transfer window; it has to be one.Past five seasonsThe managerThe Friedkin Group’s first big call as Everton owner could not have worked out better. Everton were one point above the relegation zone and in dismal form when Dyche was sacked in January.Moyes was quickly invited backafter a 12-year absence and swiftly improved the team in all departments to banish relegation fears with ease. Age and the demands of the modern dressing room may have mellowed the 62-year-old, who received an OBE in June for his services to football, but he is as ambitious as ever and the perfect foreman for the reconstruction that Everton require.Off-field pictureLast season was dominated byan emotional farewell to Goodison Park, home to Everton’s men’s team for 133 years and now the new home for Everton’s women, and a stadium will take centre stage again as the club relocate to a magnificent new residence on the banks of the River Mersey. Hill Dickinson Stadium heralds a much-needed fresh start and will help improve Everton’s finances with greater commercial opportunities at the 52,888-capacity venue. Access to and from the stadium will take some getting used to, and Moyes will be keen not to lose the intimidating advantages that Goodison offered.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Barry, as he prefers to be called, is 6ft 5in and had an impressive impact after joining the Spanish side from Basel last summer. He scored 11 goals in La Liga as Villarreal secured a return to the Champions League with a fifth-placed finish. An emerging prospect who cost £27m and is 23 in October, the striker fits the profile of signing that Everton want as they develop a team under Moyes.View image in fullscreenEverton’s Thierno Barry on the ball in a friendly against Manchester United.Photograph: Todd Kirkland/Premier League/Getty ImagesStepping upThe 18-year-old Harrison Armstrong is on the right pathway, although Everton’s fortunes in the transfer market may determine his next step. The Liverpool-born midfielder made his Premier League debut last season, impressed on his first FA Cup start and signed a long-term contract in February before joining Derby on loan. There was also an international debut for England Under-18s, who he captained against France in March. Armstrong benefited from 15 appearances for Derby and has looked sharp in pre-season. Another loan move has been mooted but there could be opportunity at Everton given their shortage of midfielders. A late decision beckons.A big season for …Everton’s captain, Séamus Coleman, has nothing to prove and could bow out a celebrated figure without making another appearance. But that is not how he will approach his 17th and possibly final season as an Everton player. A series of injuries limited the defender to four starts last season but his presence behind the scenes, continually upholding standards and reinforcing what it means to play for Everton, made it important for Moyes that he received another 12-month contract. Coleman led out Everton in their final game at Goodison and could do the same in their first at Hill Dickinson Stadium, but he will be desperate to contribute more on the pitch.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26EvertonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Despite a sole Premier League win this calendar year, Ipswich were relegated with more decorum thanLeicester CityandSouthamptonand Kieran McKenna’s side are armed to attack the second tier, even if Omari Hutchinson joins Liam Delap in departing.The 40-year-old Ashley Young, who worked with McKenna at Manchester United, looks a smart pickup and consistency can help Ipswich to flourish. Birmingham, meanwhile, are aiming to repeat a feat last achieved by Ipswich in winning successive promotions and have not been shy in reinforcing Chris Davies’s squad, but there is also momentum from a record-breaking season. Leicester are at risk of a points deduction but their new head coach, Martí Cifuentes, took 32 players on the pre-season tour to Austria and has the tools to overpower opponents. The landscape of his squad will probably look different next month – the same applies at Southampton where a flurry of departures are expected – but, unlike last season, neither are likely to be caught short. For Will Still, the returning Gavin Bazunu and Shea Charles could be key pillars at Saints.Eleven teams have changed managers since the end of last season – 15 since the turn of the year – but few transitions were as messy as Rúben Selles replacing Chris Wilder atSheffield United, playoff finalists last season. Selles, who has reunited with Louie Barry, with whom he worked at Hull City last season, has the bones of a strong squad but will need to hit the ground running to win over the Bramall Lane faithful. One of those coaches who arrived midway through last campaign will fancy his chances of kicking on: Frank Lampard revivedCoventry City, driving them into the playoffs. The arrival of the goalkeeper Carl Rushworth, on loan from Brighton, addresses a problem position, though they are short of a prolific goalscorer – the Gyökeres sell-on fee may help.Playoff hopefulsMillwallfelt an uplift after Alex Neil was appointed last December and his team are primed to go close again after finishing eighth last season, with Alfie Doughty their standout summer signing.Derby Countycould be dark horses under John Eustace, who has proven his ability as a shrewd manager at this level and plans to fuse experience with youth; Rhian Brewster, 25, could prove a revelation if he can rediscover his goalscoring touch after joining on a free.

Norwich had a soft centre last season and have revamped things with Liam Manning joining as head coach and 11 signings, including the 21-year-old striker Jovon Makama from Lincoln and the imposing Serbia midfielder Mirko Topic. This isMiddlesbrough’sninth successive season in the division and Steve Gibson has turned to Rob Edwards in search of promotion.Stoke City, too, have been stuck in the second tier – and fortunate to avoid dropping into the third – but Mark Robins has strengthened with defensive additions Aaron Cresswell and Maksym Talovierov, who impressed for Plymouth after signing in January.Swansea City’shighest-profile summer arrival has been Snoop Dogg,joining Luka Modric as a minority shareholder, but Alan Sheehan is aiming to build on the promise shown after taking the reins in February, initially on an interim basis. Swansea have made some sensible additions including Ethan Galbraith, who excelled for Leyton Orient, but probably need another striker unless Bobby Wales – born in Dublin, signed from the Scottish club Kilmarnock and now playing in England’s second tier – proves a hit.Bristol Citysqueezed into sixth on the final day last season and while Emil Riis looks an upgrade on Nahki Wells, they do not look stronger under Gerhard Struber, last seen in this division in tears after staving off relegation behind closed doors with Barnsley in 2020. John Swift has signed for hometown clubPortsmouth, who can build on 16th under the impressive John Mousinho.CharltonandWrexhamhave been aggressive in the market after promotion and have cause to look up, towards mid-table, rather than down; for the latter, Danny Ward, Conor Coady, Lewis O’Brien and Kieffer Moore represent a promising spine.Relegation candidatesAfter a summer exodus it is over to Henrik Pedersen, Danny Röhl’s former assistant, to pick up the pieces atSheffield Wednesday, a club shrouded in uncertainty amid further turbulence under Dejphon Chansiri. There is crisis around every corner at Hillsborough, where the North Stand has been closed because of structural concerns, and the remaining players spent much of pre-season training on an artificial pitch amid delays at their Middlewood Road training base.View image in fullscreenSheffield Wednesday’s off-field woes have clouded their pre-season preparations with the North Stand (top of pic) closed.Photograph: Carl Recine/Getty ImagesThe longstanding captain, Barry Bannan, has agreed to stay but aside from his commitment positives have been hard to come by. Wednesday fans are united, however, with the supporters’ trust planning a protest at Leicester on Sunday, their opening game, where the team will be backed by a sold-out away end.Hull,like Wednesday, are prohibited from spending fees on players until January 2027 – both clubs are appealing against that ruling – and after staying up on goal difference things look ominous for the the lowest scorers of last season; Sergej Jakirovic is the fifth managerial hire since Acun Ilicali took ownership three years ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ivanovic, who signed from Vojvodina on deadline day last summer, scored 12 league goals last season – 10 since the turn of the year – including a sumptuoustrivelaat Luton. The forward got a chipped pass under his spell with his left shoulder, controlled the ball with his right boot and then flung a nonchalant strike into the far corner.Jay Robinson, Southampton, 18Last season it was Tyler Dibling given a chance to impress after lighting up pre-season and now it could be the turn of another attacking midfielder. Robinson, like Dibling, represented the under-21s at 15. The former QPR youngster, first elevated to the first team by Russell Martin, has been a fixture in friendlies this summer and there is a sense that a regular spot awaits. He started the final game of last season after his debut in April, the month he signed a new four-year contract.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sesko will travel to Manchester and undergo a medical before finalising the move.The arrival of Sesko will take United’s spending to a possible £214m, after the signings of Matheus Cunha, Diego León and Bryan Mbeumo. Sesko will be an integral part of Amorim’s front three, along with Cunha and Mbeumo, as United aim to improve on their 44 goals from 38 league games last season.It will be the first time Sesko has played professionally outside the Red Bull group of clubs. He moved to RB Salzburg as a teenager from his native Slovenia, where was playing for Domzale. An immediate loan to Liefering, Salzburg’s reserve team in the second tier, was highly beneficial and he spent two seasons, scoring 22 goals in 44 appearances.Salzburg gave the imposing Sesko his Austrian Bundesliga debut in January 2021 and two and a half years of impressive goalscoring form resulted in the natural move to Leipzig.

There were glaring misses, falling-outs and some telling contributions in between, before it ended with Liverpool taking a rare financial hit on a one-time club record signing. Darwin Núñez never reached the heights Jürgen Klopp predicted he would, but it was an eventful three-year ride that ensures the striker ispoised to departin the affections of many at Liverpool.Klopp led the signing of Núñez before and especially after his two appearances for Benfica against Liverpool in the 2021-22 Champions League. But he was not the only Liverpool coach to be sold on the Uruguay international’s talents, become frustrated by attempts to accommodate the forward and ultimately sideline him.Arne Slotfollowed an identical path with the mercurial 26-year-old.Darwin Núñez expected to join Al-Hilal after Liverpool agree £46.3m feeRead moreNúñez was out of favour long before Klopp left Anfield in May 2024, starting just one of the formerLiverpoolmanager’s last seven games and cutting a disillusioned figure throughout. There was talk of Liverpool cutting their losses 12 months ago.Instead, one of Slot’s first acts as Liverpool head coach was to have a video call with Núñez while he was on Copa América duty with Uruguay. The striker was flourishing under Marcelo Bielsa and Slot hoped he could also unlock the player’s explosive qualities on a more consistent basis. Getting to work on Núñez’s fragile confidence, Slot outlined how the forward would be central to his plans – literally – operating as Liverpool’s No 9 and not out on the left, where he was sometimes deployed by Klopp.Six months later, if not before, and Liverpool’s head coach had reached the same conclusions as his predecessor. It was not a simple case of Núñez’s erratic finishing driving Slot to distraction and falling short of the standards of a team chasing the Premier League and Champions League titles, although the latter point is undoubtedly true. It was also, as Slot was happy to outline in public, a question of style. The explanation he offered in January provides an insight into what Liverpool have sought to address and will continue to do so in this transfer window, with a replacement for Núñez wanted and a £110m offer for Alexander Isak remaining on Newcastle’s table. Slot wants more flexibility and Núñez was not able to provide it.“Darwin is a striker we have to use in a certain way,” said Slot, “and we were not able yet to bring the best out of him this season. He has a lot of pace but, unfortunately for him, most teams sit back a lot against us. We are still working on getting him in the best possible positions against a low block. That involves the right timings, the right crosses, the right position to start from and making the right run.”View image in fullscreenThe Liverpool head coach, Arne Slot (right), criticised Núñez’s work rate in February but there has been no faulting the forward’s effort in pre-season.Photograph: Adam Davy/PATwenty-four hours after Slot’s admission, Núñez came off the bench to score two stoppage-time goals in a2-0 victory at Brentfordthat gave Liverpool their first league win of 2025. After a faltering start to the calendar year, it was an important step on the road to the club’s 20th league title. An outrageous chipped finish in the corresponding fixture the season before was another reminder of his ability. But it was not showcased consistently enough. After the double at Brentford there would be only one more goal from Núñez in his final 20 appearances for Liverpool, the equaliser that turned the tide against bottom-of-the-table Southampton. He could also have been sent off in that game.Núñez’s injury-time rescue act against Brentford and Slot’s honest assessment of the striker’s problems came in the same month he pushed to leave Liverpool. He and his representatives wanted Liverpool to accept a £60m offer from Al-Nassr, not reject it as the club prioritised winning the Premier League over cashing in. The same message was relayed to Liverpool this summer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Slot denied dropping the player from the squad against West Ham in April as a result of a training ground row with a member of his coaching staff. There has been no faulting the forward’s application and effort this pre-season. Núñez returned in excellent shape and has looked sharp in friendlies, though it was clearly time for all parties to move on.Liverpool are likely to lose in excess of £20m on Núñez. The Anfield club paid a guaranteed £65m for his services in 2022 with a further £20m in add-ons. Several bonus payments, however, such as for winning the Champions League and after a specified number of starts, were never activated. Al-Hilal have agreed to pay £46.3m plus add-ons and give a striker in the prime of his career a three-year contract. A lucrative move for Núñez and a statement signing for the Saudi Pro League, no doubt, but also a waste of a headline-grabbing act.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

Zabarnyi is expected to join PSG in a deal worth almost €70m (£61m), with talks over add-ons ongoing.Zabarnyi’s anticipated departure would mean Bournemouth will have generated more than £150m this summer, with fellow defenders Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsenjoining Liverpooland Real Madrid respectively.Premier League clubs are understood to be monitoring PSG’s progress with a deal for Zabarnyi, given the protracted talks in recent weeks, but the expectation is the 22-year-old Ukraine defender will depart for the French club.Darwin Núñez expected to join Al-Hilal after Liverpool agree £46.3m feeRead moreThe 24-year-old Diakite has been the subject of interest from Premier League rivals, including Sunderland.

But Ter Stegen’s announcement on social media that he would be sidelined for three months irked the management because the competition rules require a player to remain out of action for at least four months to be considered a long-term injury.“FC Barcelona announces that, following the disciplinary proceedings opened against player Marc-André ter Stegen, and until this matter is definitively resolved, the club, in agreement with the sports management and the technical staff, has decided to temporarily remove him as captain of the first team,” a statement said. “During this period, the duties of first-team captain will be assumed by the current vice-captain, Ronald Araújo.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the second half, Bayern continued to dominate, with Kingsley Coman, and teenagers Lennart Karl and Jonah Kusi-Asare getting on the scoresheet.“We were obviously playing a very good team,” Frank, whose side now go to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Uefa Super Cup next Wednesday, told the Tottenham website. “Bayern in my opinion are one of the teams that probably are favourites to win the Champions League.

But it might just workRead moreAnd for all the drama and speculation concerning Arthur, it has perhaps been easy to miss the fact that he has restored one of Super League’s most successful clubs into legitimate challengers again. With all that in mind, there was perhaps no better time for his side to deliver a performance that should convince Arthur his future is here in 2026.The Australian has promised in recent weeks that the performances of his team will help shape his decision. If that is true, there can be no doubting in his mind that this project is well worth buying into long-term. Leeds have finished eighth in each of the past two seasons, a position far too low for a club of the Rhinos’ stature.But after arriving last summer and inheriting a squad bereft of confidence, Arthur has put Leeds in a position where they are legitimate contenders once again. Now just two points adrift of second-placed Wigan with six rounds to go, this win against a side who could themselves have ended the night in second was sensational.It was a contest that wasn’t decided until the final minutes when Brodie Croft finally settled a compelling game that would have been a fitting playoff encounter. “This team keeps fighting so hard,” Arthur said. “That’ll hold us in good stead for some big games later this year.”His side were second best in the opening quarter against a Leigh side who were hunting a fifth successive win and are themselves contenders. Tries from Umyla Hanley and Keanan Brand made it 8-0 but a wonderful 40-20 from Jake Connor decisively shifted the momentum back Leeds’ way.Tries from Lachie Miller and Sam Lisone, coupled with a conversion from the boot of Connor, made it 10-8 to the visitors at the break and from there, they remained ahead for the rest of the evening. That said, it certainly wasn’t straightforward as the contest continued to ebb and flow.Leeds opened up a two-score lead when Connor’s magnificent kick led to James Bentley scoring, with the half-back’s goal creating an eight-point advantage. Leigh responded when a fine move led to Brand scoring his second of the evening and suddenly, the gap was just two points again.Pre-Arthur, Leeds would have wilted at this point. They may not have even found themselves in such a position against a side this good. Leigh came close to going back ahead when Bailey Hodgson had a try disallowed and Josh Charnley fumbled a golden opportunity.But Leeds held on, breaking away in the final minutes to secure what could be a priceless victory as Miller broke downfield and Croft was in support to put the seal on another statement win.When pushed on whether that performance had convinced him to stay, Arthur would only say: “I absolutely love my time here.” There is not long left to wait but whatever his decision is, it is increasingly clear he could be leading this side out in a Grand Final come October.Explore more on these topicsRugby leagueLeigh LeopardsLeeds RhinosnewsShareReuse this content"

The player and his representatives reiterated their desire for a move this summer.Misses, fall-outs and late goals: Darwin Núñez’s Liverpool ride was eventful one | Andy HunterRead moreNúñez made some important contributions to Liverpool’s successful pursuit of the title but started only eight Premier League games last season and struggled to adapt to Arne Slot’s tactics.Liverpool had hoped to recoup £60m for the 26-year-old and rejected a bid from Napoli earlier in the window. The Anfield club paid an initial £65m to sign Núñez from Benfica in 2022 with add-ons taking the deal to a potential club record £85m at the time. Despite becoming a popular figure at Anfield, he did not meet expectations under Slot or his predecessor, Jürgen Klopp.Liverpool will pursue another attacking option if, as anticipated, Núñez signs for Al-Hilal. The club’sbid of £110m plus add-ons for Alexander Isakremains on Newcastle’s table. Any replacement for Núñez – and Liverpool have also lost Diogo Jota and Luis Díaz from their title-winning squad – must have the quality to start and represent fair market value.Isak againtrained alone at Newcastleon Thursday and will play no part in this weekend’s Sela Cup at St James’ Park, where Newcastle face Espanyol on Friday night and Atlético Madrid on Saturday afternoon.The Sweden striker is believed to have met Eddie Howe on Wednesday afternoon after a solitary training session timed to avoid a club barbecue involving the families of players and staff to which Isak was not invited.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was joined by 15 other members of the Silicon Valley-based group, which includes the chief executives of Google, Microsoft and YouTube.The Hundred set for Twenty20 transformation as early as next yearRead moreThe Titans stunned the sports investment world in January by agreeing to pay £145m for their London Spirit stake, giving by far the highest valuation for one of the eight Hundred franchises sold off by the England and WalesCricketBoard in a remarkable auction that has raised £520m to be reinvested in domestic cricket.Marylebone Cricket Club were given the other 51% by theECBand face the task of setting up professional teams for the first time in the august institution’s 238-year history, a challenge that the MCC’s chief operating officer, Rob Lynch, describes as “extremely exciting”.Unsurprisingly their new partners are undaunted, either. Sitting high up in the Nursery End, Arora said they have never had buyer’s remorse and revealed that more investors have joined the consortium.While the Hundred has moved beyond Australia’s Big Bash League, which is now considering selling stakes, theIPLremains in a universe of its own with a total valuation of £14bn. Gujarat Titans sold a 67% stake this year in a deal that valued the franchise at £975m.“The IPL started from nowhere, and became a multibillion-dollar product,” Arora said. “Why couldn’t this be that product? There are eight new shareholders across eight new franchises. They all have successful businesses or cricket operations somewhere in the world.“If that energy, that passion, that creativity, that innovation is brought to this, imagine what they could do. The ECB incubated the Hundred, which is great, but I’m sure there are ways to optimise things.“We have never had buyer’s remorse. We’ve never been stressed about what we paid. I have more people who want to be part of the consortium now than I had before I made the investment.”View image in fullscreenLondon Spirit players celebrate taking the wicket of Will Jacks during the Hundred match against Oval Invincibles.Photograph: Keeran Marquis/SPP/ShutterstockGiven Hundred franchises have just four home fixtures each season, do not own their grounds and have a domestic TV contract with Sky Sports that is valued at about £35m a year, other sports investors are intrigued about how the new co-owners plan to recoup their outlay.While the Titans have already been using their contacts to drive commercial growth – a kit deal with Nike for next season is understood to have been agreed and a huge push on digital content is planned – Arora claims the initial focus will be on improving the on-field product. The top pay bracket in the men’s competition has been increased from £125,000 to £200,000 this year to attract stars such as David Warner and his Spirit teammate Kane Williamson, and the aspiration is to raise it to about £500,000 in the years ahead.“In our world we don’t talk about money, we talk about product,” Arora said. “We ask: ‘How can a tech company build a great product that eventually people want?’ and when a lot of people want it, they will make money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In practical terms this will lead to significant increases in what are now low ticket prices, but there will also be innovations in broadcast deals and digital products.“Whether it’s MLC in the US or the Hundred here – the IPL may be a little bit different – I think it starts with a strong domestic product,” Gajwani said. “If we’re selling out stadiums and people are excited to watch it, that’s the major driver. And then the bleed-on effect around the world will happen. Bringing in stakeholders beyond governing bodies has almost always improved product. We’ve got eight best-in-class investors, people who understand business, consumers and sport, globally and locally.“And relative to almost every other sport, cricket has less private power, for lack of a better term. The NBA is run privately, the NFL is private, La Liga, the Premier League are private businesses.

But there are also some new faces, including three uncapped players.Wallabies can take heart from Lions series for litmus Tests against South Africa | Angus FontaineRead moreSalakaia-Loto, who has been out of the Australian squad so far this year, wins a place after starring for the First Nations & Pasifika XV against the Lions three weeks ago. He played off the bench in the last of his 41 Wallabies appearances against Ireland late last year.Schmidt said the group has made “some positive steps” during the start of the international season but there is work ahead.“It’s pleasing to be able to keep the core of the group together, while also leaning on some depth and fresh bodies,” he said. “We’re very conscious of how difficult it is going to be, playing South Africa on their home turf over two consecutive weekends.”Fly half Tane Edmed has been called up due to the concussion suffered by Tom Lynagh in Sydney. Lynagh himself was only thrust into the starting lineup for the Lions series following the neck injury to Noah Lolesio. Ben Donaldson has the inside running to start at No 10, having been named on the bench for all the Lions Tests, but O’Connor is well placed to don the gold again for the first time since 2022.Edmed made his Wallabies debut last year against Ireland but it ended three minutes after he came on due to a concussion. He has struggled to cement the No 10 at the Waratahs this year, and has signed a contract with the Brumbies to replace Lolesio, who is leaving Super Rugby to play in Japan.The 24-year-old said he thought he was in the mix for selection but to be named again is an honour.“Despite the Super [Rugby] comp probably not going the way I would have liked, I always felt like I was a chance,” he said. “Everyone potentially could get injured or stuff can happen, so you can never kind of count yourself out. I’ve been ready and I’ve stayed ready.”There is more uncertainty at scrumhalf due to the hamstring injury to Jake Gordon that saw him miss the third Test. It means an SOS to White, who takes his place alongside Tate McDermott and the uncapped Brumby Ryan Lonergan in the squad.Lonergan’s teammate in the ACT, winger Corey Toole, and new Queensland Reds recruit Aidan Ross are the other uncapped players named, although Ross played a single Test for New Zealand in 2022. He has moved from the Chiefs to the Reds this year.Western Force hooker Brandon Paenga-Amosa keeps his place after his belated call-up for the third Lions Test.

The second Test is a week later in Cape Town.Edmed, who will travel to South Africa for the first time, said the presence of strong forwards Valetini and Will Skelton in the squad gives the Wallabies confidence, but the players are well aware of the task in front of them.“I’m not delusional to the fact that it’s going to be a very tough couple of games and I’m sure the squad’s the same, but we’re going to prepare as best we can, and I’m sure Joe and the squad are ready for the challenge,” he said.Wallabies squadForwards: Angus Bell, Nick Champion De Crespigny, Langi Gleeson, Tom Hooper, Fraser McReight, Josh Nasser, Zane Nonggorr, Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Billy Pollard, Tom Robertson, Aidan Ross, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Will Skelton, Carlo Tizzano, Taniela Tupou, Rob Valetini, Jeremy Williams, Harry WilsonBacks: Ben Donaldson, Tane Edmed, Josh Flook, Len Ikitau, Max Jorgensen, Andrew Kellaway, Ryan Lonergan, Tate McDermott, James O’Connor, Dylan Pietsch, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, Nic White, Tom WrightExplore more on these topicsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

As has been the case almost every time she has competed for the last 31 years, Williams fought hard until the end, but there was no fairytale outcome in the midwest. After two competitive sets on Centre Court, the in-form Spaniard Jessica Bouzas Maneiro knocked out Williams in the first round of the Cincinnati Open with a 6-4, 6-4 win.Things had looked particularly bleak for the 45-year-old Williams early on as she struggled to keep the ball in court, quickly falling down two breaks at 1-4 in the opening set. At 22, Bouzas Maneiro has been on the rise in recent months and her ranking of 51 belies a run of form that includes a fourth round at Wimbledon followed by a quarter-final in Montreal last week. The Spaniard showed her quality by remaining solid from the baseline, maintaining consistent depth, offering up few errors and looking for opportunities to redirect Williams’ pace.‘Love is the key, right?’ Evergreen Venus Williams plays on and on at 45Read more“I could hear their dismay as the set score started to look dismal in the first set,” Williams said, smiling. “But I’m thinking, ‘Folks, it’s not over. This is just the beginning.’ So we got to 4-4 and you can hear the excitement as well. It’s, very, very exciting to play at home. It’s just an honour.”Williams gradually found her rhythm and fought hard, retrieving both breaks as she dragged herself level in the opening set. She produced her best stretch of tennis in the second set, using her forehand to bully the Spaniard from the baseline and demonstrating the enduring quality she possesses with her destructive first serve to lead 4-3. In the final stages of both sets, however, Bouzas Maneiro’s shot tolerance, defence and composure under pressure determined the match.While a first-round loss at any event was once a tragedy for a player of Williams’ calibre and record, at 45 years old and after competing so sparsely in recent years, her expectations are low. While her victory over the world No 35 Peyton Stearns in Washington DC last month was a major achievement, she also left the court happy with how she had played on Thursday and she enjoyed the sensation of battling on the court again.Once again, Williams, who had already won four grand slam titles and reached No 1 by the time her opponent was born, was competitive, fought hard and did not look out of place against a talented player in one of the biggest tournaments in the world.“Right now it’s hard for me to be upset,” said Williams. “Of course, I want to win the match, but it’s hard for me to be [sad]. If you’re on tour, day in, day out and you lose a match, you’re like, ‘Man, I had some chances.’ I know that I lost this match because I just need more matches. After this match, I’m just thinking, ‘OK, what am I going to work on?’ instead of, ‘Gosh, I screwed that up.’“Yes, I could have played better. But the thing I feel good about is that I did go for it. No one dunked on my head. She definitely had some great shots, but I went for it, and sometimes they didn’t land, and sometimes she had some great shots. But it’s not that I didn’t know what to do. It’s just that I need to keep working on it.”After 10 days of practice, Williams will next compete in the revamped US Open mixed doubles tournament alongside Reilly Opelka and she will surely also receive a singles main draw wildcard. Although it would make sense at her age for the US Open to mark her final grand slam appearance, Williams has shown for three decades that her next move is impossible to predict.Elsewhere, Coco Gauff said she is willing to exhaust her energy reserves in service of winning her second grand slam title of the season at the US Open. “It feels like I’m pushing that nitro button and just leaving it all out there. This is the part of the season that I feel like you’re just like: ‘I just want to give it literally everything.’”In the men’s draw, Jacob Fearnley, the British No 3, fell 6-1, 6-4 to Zizou Bergs of Belgium in the first round.Explore more on these topicsTennisVenus WilliamsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Forerunner 570 continues the revamp of the company’s running watches, which have all gained more accurate GPS chips and improved heart rate monitors. The new model replaces the popular 265 and sits under the 970. It offers a similar look and feel to the top watch but with a few key features removed for a lower price.Unfortunately the reduced price is still quite high at £450 (€550/$550/A$999), which puts the 570 well above most mid-range rivals and dangerously close to top-of-the-range money.The 570 has quite a few updated hardware and software features,compared with the 265. It comes in a choice of 42mm or 47mm sizes and in a range of fun colours – or black for those looking for something more understated.View image in fullscreenThe speaker just above the strap is loud and clear for laps and other alerts while running, or for the new Bluetooth calling and voice assistant features.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe polycarbonate body, metal buttons and aluminium bezel feel high quality, with a super bright, crisp and great-looking OLED touchscreen.Like theFenix 8andForerunner 970, the watch has Garmin’s newoffline voice command systemfor quickly setting timers, accessing settings, starting activities and other functions of the watch. It will alsoconnect to your phone’s voice assistantso you can speak to Siri or Gemini, or take calls on your wrist.The 570 has the same revamped interface as the 970, making it a more capable smartwatch for handling notifications or controlling music on your phone. It also supports the recentlyreleased Google Maps app, but only with Android phones.It can download various apps from theConnect IQ app storeincluding Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music or others for phone-free music on runs. Garmin Pay is available for contactless payments, thoughUK bank supportis very limited.View image in fullscreenThe 570 ships with plenty of interesting and customisable watch faces, with more available in the Connect IQ app store.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe battery of the 47mm watch lasts about five days of smartwatch use with the screen on all the time, which is a day or so short of the 970 or the 265. The 570’s default screen brightness is very high, however, so turning it down one level added about a day to the battery life. It will last about 10 days with the always-on display setting turned off.SpecificationsScreen:1.2in or 1.4in AMOLEDCase size:42mm or 47mmCase thickness:12.9mmBand size:standard 20mm or 22mmWeight:42g or 50gStorage:8GBWater resistance:50 metres (5ATM)Sensors:GNSS (Multiband GPS, Glonass, Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse OxConnectivity:Bluetooth, ANT+, wifiRunning and activity trackingView image in fullscreenThe bright and crisp display makes seeing lots of data fields and metrics while running easy at a glance, of which you can have up to eight on a single screen.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Forerunner has Garmin’s latest optical heart rate sensor on the back and dual band GPS for some of the most accurate tracking available. It has more than 85 different sport profiles built in, so it will track most things.For running and triathlon it packs nearly everything that the 970 offers, including wrist-based power and running dynamics, adaptive coaching plans with suggested workouts, performance condition and various VO2 Max and fitness estimations. It lacks offline maps, however, only providing breadcrumb navigation on planned routes or back to the start of your run.It also includes Garmin’s useful recovery tools, such as training readiness, which are the best in the business. The only things it lacks are Garmin’s new impact load andrunning tolerance featuresthat are limited to the 970, which is a shame.The battery lasts about 14 hours of running with the highest accuracy settings or about eight hours while also listening to offline music from Spotify using Bluetooth headphones, which is solid but not class leading and several hours short of the 970.View image in fullscreenThe watch charges via a USB-C cable that slots into the port next to the sensor cluster on the back, reaching 70% in about 40 minutes and full in 83 minutes.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe 570 has all of Garmin’s most recent general health tracking features, including its excellent body battery system, a sleep coach, morning and evening health and recovery briefings, stress, women’s health and heart health, with one exception: it lacks the ability to record an ECG. With similarly priced rivals from Apple, Google and Samsung all supporting the feature thathelps spot heart conditions, it seems like a miss.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenVoice command can quickly access offline features on the watch, but only with the correct phrases.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe watch is generally repairable with optionsavailable via support. The battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials. Garmin guarantees security updates until at least 21 May 2027 but typically supports its devices far longer. It offersrecycling schemeson new purchases.PriceThe Garmin Forerunner 570 costs £459.99 (€549.99/$549.99/A$999).For comparison, theGarmin Fenix 8starts from£780, theForerunner 970costs£630, theForerunner 165£250, the Coros Pace 3£219, the Suunto Run£199and the Polar Pacer Pro£299.VerdictThe Forerunner 570 is a great running watch that is priced just a little too high to be a wholehearted recommendation.It looks great with standout colours, a super bright and crisp screen, and many of the good bits of theForerunner 970. It is one of the most accurate for GPS and heart rate tracking, records almost every metric under the sun, and plugs into Garmin’s unrivalled training and recovery systems. It also works pretty well as a day-to-day smartwatch.The lack of offline maps, a built-in torch, ECG or the latest running tolerance features, and a shorter daily-use battery life could be excused at a lower price. But at £460 or equivalent, the 570 stacks up poorly against more feature-rich rivals making it one to look out for on a deal.Pros:super bright OLED screen, phone and offline voice control, Garmin Pay, extensive tracking and recovery analysis for running and many other sports, offline Spotify, buttons and touch, most accurate GPS.Cons:expensive, no ECG, no offline maps, no running tolerance, no torch, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared with Apple/Google/Samsung watches, shorter battery life than other Forerunners.View image in fullscreenOffline Spotify or other music streaming services remain a killer feature that other dedicated running watches can’t match.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsGarminSmartwatchesWearable technologyGadgetsRunningreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the federal government plans to include YouTube in itsforthcoming ban on social media accountsfor children under the age of 16, Guardian readers responded to a call out about their own kids’ use of the platform and what they thought of the ban.This is what they told us.‘Simply impossible to monitor’Parents frequently reported they were restricting their children’s use to shared areas by co-watching or through parental controls. But many said this was time-intensive and nearly impossible to maintain and were concerned about which content was slipping under their radar.“We useYouTubeKids and always check what they watch before we let them watch anything on there. We do this because YouTube cannot be trusted – the algorithm leads you very quickly down weird or concerning rabbit holes and the messaging in a video is often subtle and hard to screen as a parent without pre-watching everything (which is not realistic).Children to be banned from having YouTube accounts as Albanese government backflips on exemptionRead more“The final reason [we restrict our children’s use] is because of my own experience with YouTube as an adult. I currently feel like I am having to actively fight against the algorithm taking me in direction I don’t want to go. I watch one video of a gel blaster, and I get 100 videos of Americans shooting guns. One video of a bodybuilder in the gym and I get 100 scantily clad fitness models … If I have to fight this hard, YouTube would do the same with my kids.”Marty, father of two children under nine, Brisbane“Before we removed it, our children would watch YouTube for hours. We removed it because they would get stuck in gratification loops and jump from one video to the next.“I have enjoyed watching some videos with our children. Some are clever and very funny. But ultimately it’s too difficult to regulate, filter content and be sure they’re not being exposed to potentially harmful content. We have three boys and we’re aware that many videos contain explicit and implicit attitudes that young boys can be influenced by when it comes to women, for example.”Parent of three children who are 13, 11 and six years old, Adelaide“YouTube is the bane of our existence – we wish it never existed. Our son locks himself in his room and for the recent school holidays spent almost the entire two weeks on YouTube and gaming. We’ve got no idea what harmful content he’s seen as there always seems to be a loophole to internet monitoring software.”Dan, parent of a 15-year-old and a 12-year-old, Melbourne“YouTube provides next to no useful parental controls over content and the few measures they do have are next to useless (having gone through the whole thing very recently). While so far we have been lucky in that [our son’s] rather narrow focus has kept his feed relatively free of less than ideal content, we are always concerned that he will be served up something totally inappropriate.”Gerard, father of a 13-year-old, Canberra“There is no control over what they see. Even with strict settings on YouTube Kids, my child was automatically played horrific content disguised as kids’ TV.”Peter, father of three children who are two, four and six years old, Sydney“It is simply impossible to monitor the content that is being viewed but even through occasional glances at the feed I can tell that my daughter is being exposed to a lot of material with beauty/body image stereotypes, while my son’s feed tends to be more larrikin/sport oriented. I am also left with the impression that the content is rife with misinformation.”Richard, parent of a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old, HobartThe more governments try to restrict social media use, the more young people will find ways to get around it | Leo PuglisiRead more“My children are children and by that definition are easily swayed by bright lights and dopamine-releasing repetitive reward programming. My issues with YouTube is that it is used as a kind of poker machine to make money off of our built-in thirst for dopamine and we all have been sucked in. I would prefer more controls to avoid the rubbish while benefiting from the very good content available but alas the reality is that the educational stuff is not the money maker, the brain-draining, high energy, colourful trope is the heart of what runs this behemoth.”Monique, parent of an eight-year-old and an 11-year-old, Bell Post Hill‘They can watch it for hours without breaks’From fleeting attention spans and hours wasted to concerns about the content that can slip under the radar of children’s YouTube feeds, many parents felt the YouTube algorithm encouraged excessive use and offered potentially harmful content.“I do worry how short content impacts their ability to pay attention and I notice that a TV or a movie definitely doesn’t hold their attention for as long. We have to give a warning before we turn it off to manage the transition away from screens. Some of the content certainly seems mindless (like my daughter watching another child playing with dolls) but they also regularly tell me interesting facts and info they’ve learned on YouTube.”Parent of a three-year-old and a five-year-old, Sydney“The waste of time it actively cultivates through the algorithm, there’s no warning as to what will pop up next, it seems to get weirder and more extreme the longer you watch it. I have no faith in the tech companies caring about the wellbeing of children. I think they actively create algorithms that are harmful in purpose to get eyeballs for longer.”Alicia, parent of an eight-year-old and a 12-year-old, Colonel Light Gardens“If left to watch YouTube by themselves, as they have occasionally at friends’ houses, it is always puerile, short-attention-span mashup [of] rubbish or scary videos such as [the horror video game] Poppy Playtime, etc. Our youngest watched three hours of this at a friend’s house a few years ago and had nightmares for months.“I’m very supportive of the educational content in YouTube, but despite having free access to this the kids just do not seem to choose to watch it and only watch rubbish.”Damien, father of a nine-year-old and a 12-year-old, Sydney“It’s has been (at times) frustrating due to YouTube being happy to expose our kids to inappropriate content. Shorts is diabolical. But it has gotten better once we could identify our kids as YouTube users.”Matt, father of a 16-year-old and an 11-year-old, BallaratSign up: AU Breaking News email“I teach ethics at a local public school and in a section where we asked about a dream job about half the kids said they wanted to be gamer YouTubers, which is a concern, although older age groups seem to grow out of this.“I am less concerned about ‘inappropriate content’ as I am about completely valueless content, and kids don’t have the ability to discern the difference.”Parent of a 15, 13 and 10-year-old, Sydney“It’s a genuine addiction, including full-on tantrums when it is restricted.”Parent of a 16-year-old, Brisbane, Queensland“They can watch it for hours without breaks. So the rule we have now is one hour a day. Especially for my seven-year-old, who would immediately melt down and cry when it was turned off.

Since we limit his YouTube to more educational stuff, we have found his mood to be a lot more stable.”Kevin, father of a 13-year-old, Burua‘He learned to crochet from YouTube’Many parents cited huge educational benefits from YouTube, from supporting niche hobbies to allowing children a creative outlet as content creators themselves.“I am concerned about the level of unfiltered content he could easily be exposed to if he strayed off the path, but I am actually more concerned about the possibility of him losing access to it. He learned how to crochet from YouTube, we both learned about intersectional feminism and we are about to jointly learn how to weatherproof our flat.”Single parent to a teenage son, ACT“We use YouTube for education (eg Ms Rachel, how things are made, volcanoes, David Attenborough content), entertainment (Puffing Billy videos, music videos eg Teeny Tiny Stevies). I am a music teacher and use YouTube every day (online footage of musical performances, tutorial videos, other students playing students pieces, professional recordings of band pieces etc). [YouTube is] the best education platform in the history of civilisation!!!”Parent to a two-year-old and a five-year-old, MelbourneHow will Australia’s under-16s social media ban be enforced, and which platforms will be exempt?Read more“Both my sons 11 and 14 regularly use YouTube for information and gaming videos. My eldest has an account where he makes videos about his ant colonies. He has about 100 followers, other kids who are into ants. I don’t [support the ban]. Many kids are just sharing their knowledge and passions which is healthy.”Parent of an 11-year-old and a 14-year-old, Sydney“Our son uses YouTube daily for his main hobby, which is stop-motion filming with Lego setups. He spends many hours on beautiful video clips, edits them and uploads the final product to YouTube where he has followers on his own channel. The whole thing is a really creative, productive hobby, and YouTube plays a central part in it.”Dan Arno, father of an 11-year-old son, Munich‘If these companies will not regulate themselves then something has to be done’Parents had a diverse range of views on whether or not a ban on under-16s from having their own YouTube accounts is desirable or effective, citing concerns about privacy in the proposed law alongside a frustration that parents were unable to protect their children from harmful or excessive use without more regulation.“I don’t support the current legislation at all. It should be biased toward making the tech companies change their content policies, not require more [personal identification] be uploaded to the internet for age verification purposes.”Parent of a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old, Brisbane“Now I will have to put my own YouTube access into restricted mode to give to them access, or create a fake account, which I do not want to do. My partner and I will decide what my children watch and what social media they have access to. This is just more boomers and [members of] gen X making decisions about, and interfering with, things that are none of their business.”Parent of two children, western Sydney“Digital platforms and tech bros make billions out of content creators’ violent antisocial material and it is watched over and over by impressionable kids. Parents struggle to police this and the only winners are the content creators and the digi-tech billionaire platform owners.”Parent of a 16-year-old son, Windsor“Their accounts give us a history of what has been watched. [A ban is] unenforceable. It’s a breach of my privacy to have to register myself.”Tim, parent of two children, Blackburn“100% [I support the ban]. The tech companies, despite their protestations, have proven themselves, over and over again, to have little to no interest in creating a safe environment for kids.”Gerard, father of a 13-year-old son, Canberra“I hem and haw about it. I’m sure that the ban will be easily breached by the under-16s who are determined.

Apple’s CEO,Tim Cook, warnedduring an earnings call in Maythat the tariffs could cost the company up to $900m that fiscal quarter alone.After Cook gifted Trump a US-made souvenir with a 24-karat gold base at the Oval Office on Wednesday, the president praised the corporation,telling reporters: “Companies like Apple, they’re coming home … This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in America also are made in America.”Cook said many components of the iPhones are already made domestically, including glass, semiconductors and face ID, but that final assembly of the devices would remain overseas “for a while”. In an earlier statement, Cook had said the new investments involve work with 10 companies across the US that produce components used in Apple products.Big tech has spent $155bn on AI this year. It’s about to spend hundreds of billions moreRead moreApplehad previously said it intended to invest $500bn domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600bn.Applealso claimed that it would directly hire 20,000 US workers over the next four years.Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and Cook for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China. The same day as the White House announcement, Trump doubled US tariffs on India from 25% to 50%.While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was “a little problem” with Apple and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO: “I don’t want you building in India.”India has incurred Trump’s wrath, as the president signed an order on Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world’s most populous country for its use of Russian oil. The new import taxes to be imposed in 21 days could put the combined tariffs on Indian goods at 50%.Apple had attempted to get ahead of any tariffs on India in April by shipping as many as 1.5m iPhones from the country into the US,according to Reuters.The company has been uniquely threatened by Trump’s tariffs as iPhones include parts manufactured in dozens of countries and the devices themselves are largely assembled in China. Shifting production of the devices to the US would drastically increase the cost to the point that most analysts view an American-made iPhoneas a pipe dream, leaving Apple to navigate the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s trade wars.As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That agreement will enable MP Materials to expand a factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce magnets that make iPhones vibrate.Speaking on a recent investors call, Cook emphasized that “there’s a load of different things done in the United States”. As examples, he cited some of the iPhone components made in the US, such as the device’s glass display and module for identifying people’s faces and then indicated the company was gearing to expand its productions of other components in its home country.“We’re doing more in this country, and that’s on top of having roughly 19bn chips coming out of the US now, and we will do more,” Cook told analysts last week, without elaborating.Despite Apple’s struggles with looming tariffs and concern from investors over its lag in fully embracing artificial intelligence, thecompany’s latest earnings reportshowed that it made huge gains in iPhone sales and easily beat Wall Street’s expectations for its year-over-year revenue. Apple’s stock, which was down double digits so far this year, spiked upward over 5% on Wednesday following news of Trump’s announcement.Explore more on these topicsAppleDonald TrumpTim CookiPhoneSmartphonesMobile phonesUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bernband is “a sci-fi exploration game for people who like to wander…”. Players will be able to simply walk around a colourful and unusual world, wandering in the glow cast by streetlights and ducking beneath zigzagging overhead flags. They’ll tour hallways where strange green life grows politely in planters, and they’ll even get the chance to snooze on rattling otherworldly subway trains while hand grips – tentacle grips? – jiggle as they hang overhead. “There’s no goal but to stroll,” the game’s Steam page promises. “Where will your feet take you?”There’s something intoxicating about a game that just lets you wander. But it doesn’t mean the game itself is easy to make, of course. “Wandering [as] the main goal is quite difficult for many reasons,” says Tom van den Boogaart, the developer of Bernband, who is using the project to reimagine a much smaller version he made in 2014. “To let players explore on their own, I think you first of all need to give them some context, such as where they are and what kind of world they are exploring.”View image in fullscreen‘Exploration is the main goal’ … Bernband.Photograph: Sokpop CollectiveAs a result, every wander through Bernband begins in the same way: in a small apartment with a window that offers a glimpse of the strange universe the game inhabits. “The idea is to communicate that you are someone who’s living in this city,” Van den Boogaart says. “And that over time it will start to feel familiar. It’s clear that your journey starts when you walk out of there through the door.” The apartment also serves as a place that players can return to after exploring the city. “It creates the minor goal of, ‘can I find my way back to my apartment?’. Perhaps even if it’s just something subconscious.”Van den Boogart quickly learned that a wandering game also needs to give players a number of places to head for at any time. As a result, most of the world of Bernband is set up in a nonlinear manner. “Most of the time there are multiple ways to reach a location,” he says, “of which some are a bit more hidden or obscure than others. When exploration is the main goal of the game, you want to give players the choice of what to explore. Even if it’s as simple as going left or right at a crossing.”View image in fullscreenAn alien city inspired by real-life places … Bernband.Photograph: Sokpop CollectiveWith a design this unobtrusive, Van den Boogaart admits it’s been a constant battle not to gamify things a little, whether that’s adding a map that shows players places they’ve already been to or a checklist for them to complete as they walk. He has resisted, however. “I believe that having access to information like this takes away the magical feeling of stumbling upon a secret area,” he laughs. “You would already in some way know that it exists.”Bernband’s alien city is not a traditional open world, but instead consists of discrete areas that are linked by elevators and other transportation methods. The approach was chosen to allow players to focus completely on specific parts of a bigger place, all of which turn out to have their own personalities and flavours. In turn, Van den Boogaart works from a list of locations that he thinks would be fun or interesting. To keep himself creative, he ensures this list is fairly vague: big supermarket, shady bar, swimming pool with water slide.And while it’s an alien world, Bernband is inspired by places that Van den Boogaart knows in real life, whether that’s his home town of Gouda in the Netherlands or the places the games industry tends to orbit,such as Tokyo, San Francisco and Stockholm.“When making a game, I prefer to draw inspiration from personal memories and experiences instead of other media such as games or film,” he says. “It helps me to build a deeper and more personal connection with my work, and I hope that in the end this also gives the game and the world a unique feel.”Bernband is in development forPC, release date not yet confirmedExplore more on these topicsGamesSummer games previewsPCfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maxwell, too, was not initially eligible for such a transfer, due to her sex offender status; connections at the Department of Justice had to waive a procedural requirement in order for the move to go through.The transfer appears to be a reward. AsDonald Trumpstruggles to extract himself from the continuing fallout of the Epstein scandal, Maxwell finds herself, now, in the best position that she has been in since her one-time partner Epstein died in a jail cell in 2019. Suddenly, she has something that the president wants: the ability to say, truthfully or no, that Trump had nothing to do with Epstein’s sex trafficking. The president, too, has something that Maxwell wants: the ability to issue a pardon.Maxwell has always formed the dark center of the Epstein saga, a woman who appears to have been exceptionally dedicated to arranging Epstein’s life, facilitating his travel, luring new victims to his homes, and coordinating his sexual abuse over the course of decades. Alleged victims of Epstein recall being recruited by Maxwell in public places – including at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach – and through friends.They saythat sheinspected their bodies, brought them to Epstein’s homes, talked incessantly about sex, and instructed them in Epstein’s sexual preferences. They also say that Epstein and Maxwell sometimes made them available for sexual abuse by their friends.Ghislaine Maxwell is not a victim. And if she is pardoned, it won’t be for the sake of justice | Arwa MahdawiRead moreShe is widely presumed to know more than she has yet been willing to tell about the extent to which Epstein’s large network of powerful businessmen, politicians, and financiers knew about or participated in his rapes and trafficking of children. What is less clear, at least at first, is what motivated her to facilitate the abuse, and what kept her so loyal to Epstein over so many years.Maybe this kind of life – one spent attending to men’s lesser desires – was always what Maxwell was destined for. The ninth and youngest child of a British media magnate, Maxwell was doted on by her father, the Czechoslovakia-born Robert Maxwell, and raised in Oxford in a family as obscenely wealthy as it was darkly tragic: one of her older brothers was in a hideous car accident just days after Ghislaine’s birth, and the boy lingered in a coma for years before dying before her 10th birthday.Her father financed her life as a high-class party girl – first in London, and then in New York – where she spent much of her time accompanying famous and wealthy men to the kind of rich people’s social functions that have a pretext of raising money for charity. She does not seem to have had aims beyond that: despite her ample resources and encouragement, Ghislaine never showed much sign of intellectual ambition, or political interest, or business acumen, or general curiosity. (A short-lived “ocean protection” charity that she founded accomplished little, and shut down after her arrest on sex trafficking charges.) It was not merely that Ghislaine was a product of an elite unburdened by principle, who often reduce their daughters to mere ornaments. It is that an ornament, it seems, is all thatGhislaine Maxwellever aspired to be.It was not her charity, or her father’s publishing, that were Maxwell’s great passions. Her great passion appears to have been for the romantic attention of men – and specifically, her life’s greatest animating goal seems to have been to achieve, and keep, the attention of Jeffrey Epstein. From those accounts we have of their relationship – and admittedly, these are not always reliable, given how intense, widespread, and prurient the attention on their activities has been – it appears that Maxwell’s devotion to Epstein was intense. At her trial in 2021, prosecutors entered into evidence a photo of a cleavage-bearing Maxwell with Epstein,massaging his foot. This seems to have been her posture toward Epstein for the entire time she knew him: slavish, nearly worshipful.This seems to have been her posture toward Epstein for the entire time she knew him: slavish, nearly worshipfulThe pair met sometime in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Maxwell’s father, Robert, died in an apparent suicide in the ocean off the coast of the Canary Islands – aboard his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine – in late 1991. Soon thereafter, it was discovered that millions of dollars were missing from pension funds that he managed; two of Maxwell’s brothers were charged for their alleged role in the fraud. (They werelater acquitted.) It was during this moment of rupture and imperiled status that Maxwell was romantically involved with Epstein. Her boyfriend would have served as a meal ticket as well as a source of validation: Maxwell is alleged to have received payments from Epsteintotaling more than $30m; she told one of her victims that he bought her her New York City townhouse, just a few blocks from his own. By 1994, she was recruiting and grooming teenagers for his sexual abuse.Maybe Maxwell justified what she did for Epstein as kink – a kind of sexual libertinism that shrugged off the regressive, prurient mores of the lower classes. The 90s were the peak of a kind of reductive heterosexual sex-positivity: lots of women were telling themselves, and being told, that sexual submission was a mark of sophistication – that the more liberated they were, the more of men’s desires they would grant. But this is all speculation: trying to provide a rationalization for Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions evades the true terror of her, which is her seemingly profound and horrifying vacancy. To such a person, obedience does not require a justification.Unequal desire in love – particularly when the suffering lover is a woman – tends to elicit a kind of pity. Feminists, too, oftendepictwomen’s outsized desire for men as a form of gendered victimization. Generally, it is not seen asserious –women’s limerence, romantic obsession, and striving for men’s attention is broadly relegated to the realm of the adolescent and the vulgar, the embarrassing and the silly. But Maxwell’s case suggests such desire can breed not just frustrated vanity but also a kind of monstrousness. Untempered by principle or self-respect, it can contain in it the seed of the grotesque. In her efforts to please Epstein, and to make herself useful to him, Maxwell became something hideous and unforgivable. In her deficient, warped soul, it seems she lacked something that every woman must have: a morality that she valued more than male approval.This story was amended on 7 August 2025. An earlier version reported that Robert Maxwell was born in Hungary, but he was born in Czechoslovakia.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellOpinionJeffrey EpsteinDonald TrumpUS prisonscommentShareReuse this content"

From Black and Latino men to young and low-income voters, Trump’s re-election made it clear that working Americans increasingly feel alienated from the Democratic party.Democrats today might not be as sanguine about sidelining the working class as Chuck Schumer was before the 2016 election, when he claimed that for every blue-collar voter Democrats lost, they could pick up two college-educated Republicans. But it’s clear that many Democrats still don’t see winning back working-class voters as essential – either to defeat Maga or to build durable, majoritarian progressive coalitions for the future.A new reportfrom the Center for Working-Class Politics (CWCP) and Jacobin magazine, based on an analysis of hundreds of public opinion questions spanning six decades, suggests that blue-collar voters are not out of reach – if Democrats are willing to lead with economic populism. The report shows that American workers have long supported – and still overwhelmingly favor – a bold progressive economic agenda. If Democrats placed these policies consistently at the heart of their platform, they could not only improve conditions in working-class communities but also begin to rebuild trust with the very voters they need most.Now’s the time for Democrats to hammer Trump on the economy | Lloyd GreenRead moreProgressive economic reforms – from raising the federal minimum wage and implementing a federal jobs guarantee to expanding social security, taxing the rich, and investing in public goods such as education and infrastructure – are supported not only by Democratic-leaning voters but also by substantial segments of Donald Trump’s base.And while national Democrats remain unsure how to reconnect with these voters, a new generation of economic populists across the country is already showing the way. In New York City,Zohran Mamdaniwon the Democratic mayoral primary campaigning to tax the rich, fund public goods and confront corporate landlords. In Nebraska, independent union leader Dan Osborn – a mechanic and labor activist – ran on a tight platform of workers’ rights and corporate accountability and over-performed Kamala Harris by 14 points in a deep-red state.In difficult House swing districts, Democrats are leaning into economic populism with promising results. In Pennsylvania’s 17th district, Chris Deluzio, a representative and navy veteran, champions “economic patriotism”, calling out economic elites and damaging trade agreements while pushing to rebuild domestic industry and strengthen labor rights. In New Mexico’s second district, Gabe Vasquez has built his platform around a sharp critique of corporate greed – condemning CEOs and wealthy investors for inflating profits while shortchanging workers – and has pushed for a $15 minimum wage and cutting taxes for working families.Meanwhile, in Wisconsin’s third district, Democrat Rebecca Cooke – a waitress and small business owner who grew up on a dairy farm – is mounting a 2026 comeback bid after over-performing other Democrats and losing by less than three points in 2024, running on a platform that targets corporate price gouging, expands affordable rural housing and defends family farms.The path to winning back working-class voters runs through authenticity, clarity and a credible commitment to improving people’s livesThese candidates come from different regions and backgrounds, and hold diverse ideological positions, but nonetheless share a core political strategy: they are highly disciplined economic populists who speak to working-class voters in language that’s grounded, direct and relatable.And, contrary to many centrist pundits, while they do need to avoid fringe rhetoric, Democrats don’t have to embrace social conservatism to do it. The CWCP study shows that while working-class voters are generally to the right of middle-class voters on cultural issues, most hold moderate, and in some cases even progressive, views on issues such as immigration, abortion and civil rights. These voters do not want Democrats to mimic Republicans on controversial wedge issues, but they do want a commonsense message focused on the economic realities of working Americans.Yet working-class voters don’t just embrace politicians who support the right policies. Ourprevious researchshows that they want leaders who understand people like them, share a similar class background and speak plainly about what they’ll do and why it matters. The path to winning back working-class voters runs through authenticity, clarity and a credible commitment to improving people’s lives.Unfortunately, the national party has been slow to adapt. Harris’s 2024 campaign offered ambitious economic proposals that could have benefited millions of working Americans. But as the race wore on, she grew increasingly reluctant to lead with economic populism, instead doubling down on a strategy rooted in fear of Trump. That may have comforted donors and consultants, but it left many working-class voters cold – and opened the door for Republicans to posture as the party of the people.This vacuum has given Republicans room to pose as economic populists, despite an agenda that overwhelmingly serves corporations and the wealthy. Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill Act delivered massive tax cuts for the rich while masquerading as a working-class boon. House Republicans have attacked union protections and slashed social welfare programs – moves wildly out of step with working-class preferences. But without a compelling Democratic alternative, the right’s billionaire populism can take hold. If Democrats want to rebuild a durable majority, they need candidates who stay focused on populist economics and steer clear of the culture wars.Reversing the Democratic party’s working-class decline will not be solved by platitudes or photo ops with hard hats. It demands a real shift in priorities. It means crafting campaigns that focus relentlessly on tangible economic outcomes and elevating candidates who reflect the experience of the working class. And it demands a clear, consistent message that puts class and dignity back at the center of Democratic politics.Jared Abbott is the director of the Center for Working-Class PoliticsBhaskar Sunkara is the president of the Nation magazine and the founding editor of JacobinExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionClass issuesInequalityZohran MamdaniUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

That should be the stuff of vital debate: right now, it isn’tThu 7 Aug 2025 11.42 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 14.21 EDTShareThis week marks 80 years since the horrors ofHiroshima and Nagasaki, as the few remaining witnesses tell of incinerated, melted and obliterated families. Soon there will be none left to remember. Survivors’ graphic accounts of “the noiseless flash” were captured by John Hersey inhis book Hiroshima, read by my generation with shock and fear. Nevil Shute’s On the Beach taught us every gut-wrenching detail of the radiation sickness I fully expected to die of. Civil defence leaflets told families how to hide under the stairs with a radio and torch.I grew up expecting early death by nuclear war. My father was a 1957 founder of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament who didn’t expect us to survive inevitable nuclear holocaust. He carried a large bottle of suicide pills, enough to kill us all when the bomb fell, to save us from slowly perishing by strontium-90. When he left the jar behind driving on holiday to Wales, he had to turn back halfway there to fetch it. We lived under the shadow of the mushroom cloud. We knew that the three white geodesic domes of the Fylingdales early warning system would give us exactly four minutes, enough to boil an egg or run a very fast mile.I set off with him aged 11 on the first Aldermaston march (though after speaking in Trafalgar Square, my alcoholic father got no further than the Bunch of Grapes in Knightsbridge). But every year afterwards I went with friends on that four-day Easter march to the atomic weapons research establishment in Berkshire: it was the high social event of the year, the Glastonbury of our generation, though our fear and outrage were real too.View image in fullscreenPolly Toynbee at a CND demonstration in 1970.Photograph: Courtesy of Polly ToynbeeWhat let that sense of imminent doom fade? The Vietnam war took over most protesting energies, and now the climate crisis is evident, desperate and immediate. The nuclear threat fell down the league table of fear, though it’s as great or greater. The US and Russiashow alarming readinessto use nuclear weapons as a sabre-rattling threat. “I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Donald Trump announced in response to former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev tweeting that he would be ready to launch a nuclear strike over the war in Ukraine.In the cold war standoff, mutually assured destruction seemed to make the use of them pretty unthinkable, though neither side could gauge the other’s willingness to end the world. There were close calls, over theCuban missile crisisand the 1980s deployment of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Now neither Trump nor Putin may be rational, nor think each other rational, and either might twitch their finger on the button. To talk nuclear threat suggests first use is not taboo. Trident, our US-dependent nuclear-armed submarines, are our “weapon of last resort”.New designs can be deployed on a battlefield. Are these a more plausible deterrent or a more dangerously “usable” weapon? The non-proliferation treaty has not prevented Pakistan, North Korea, India or Israel becoming nuclear states: Iran may soon follow. Disarmament and world peace made no progress:61 armed conflictsin 2024 were the most since the second world war.Nato has fallen apart, never again certain that the US will defend its allies, whoever is president. With Russia more threatening than ever, Europe must defend itself, pulling the continent together with joint French, British and, they hope, German nuclear capacity. Unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain does not look a good proposition.Nuclear weaponsare as terrifying and as mad as ever they were, but getting rid of them and burying the knowledge to make them looks ever harder in a more dangerous world.“Don’t make us a target” is CND’s current campaign slogan. But Europe abandoning these weapons would make us Russian vassals. Jeremy Corbyn, a CND vice-president, who is in Hiroshima this week for the commemoration, said: “As we reflect on 80 yearssince the criminal bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we must ask where is the leadership in pursuing the urgent need for nuclear disarmament?”View image in fullscreenThe first protest march to Aldermaston in May 1958. Many children were among the thousands who set out from Trafalgar Square.Photograph: © Henry Grant Collection/London MuseumCriminal? The inconvenient truth is that most historians think fewer people died in those bombings than would have perished in a prolonged invasion ofJapan. That doesn’t diminish the horror.Corbyn this week called on Britain to “rethink its disastrous nuclear expansion”. But unilateral disarmament always blighted Labour’s chances, as Nye Bevan knew when he urged the party not to send a Labour foreign secretary “naked into the conference chamber”. Unilateralism, and a pledge to leave the common market, made Michael Foot’s 1983 manifesto the “longest suicide note in history”. Neil Kinnock, once a CND supporter, persuaded his party to abandon unilateralism ahead of the 1992 election.That Kinnock journey is one many of us took. But old Aldermaston songs stay embedded: “Don’t you hear the H-bombs’ thunder / Echo like the crack of doom? / While they rend the skies asunder / Fallout makes the Earth a tomb”, with its rousing refrain, “Ban the bomb, forever more!” It was a walking political education under multitudinous banners for anarchists, young communists, Quakers, the ANC and 57 varieties of socialist splinters, Trotskyite, Maoist and Stalinist.Traitors, terrorists? Bertrand Russell, aged 89, led direct action, causing mass traffic obstruction with Whitehall sit-ins: would they now be called “terrorists”, following Labour’s draconian and provocativeban on Palestine Action? Whatever their causes, atrocities from Hiroshima to Gaza deserve the right to public expression of plain, Quaker-style revulsion at monstrous inhumanity.The mayor of Hiroshimaat Wednesday’s memorial ceremonylinked the Ukraine and Gaza wars to a growing acceptance of nuclear weapons: their perpetrators “flagrantly disregard the lessons the international community should have learned from the tragedies of history”. The white doves released didn’t really suggest hope. He was right to call for a renewed urgency of a bygone age to remind those grown complacent of the reality of nuclear warfare. Forgetting that debate these days makes the unthinkable possible. Human idiocy has many ways to end the world.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistThis article was amended on 7 August 2025 – Neil Kinnock’s Labour abandoned unilateralism in 1989, ahead of the 1992 general electionExplore more on these topicsNuclear weaponsOpinionJapanSecond world warJeremy CorbynAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

At Bloc Party’s Melbourne show this past Sunday, my bestie and I followed the growing crowds of 30-and-older, skinny jean wearing, middle-aged hipsters towards John Cain Arena, excited torevel in the nostalgic music of our youth.Because we’re old now, we did the sensible thing and booked reserved seating. But like any reasonable gig-goer, we knew implicitly that just because the seats are there, it doesn’t mean everyone is expected to sit in them for the duration of the set.I would have thought it obvious that attending a rock gig entails a certain commitment to bodily movement. It’s nice that we can choose to bow out of the sweaty, heaving, foot-crushing, back pain-inducing revelry of the mosh pit but having a seat doesn’t mean we’re completely dead yet, it just means we’re selective about when we dance and no longer have the capacity to stand for more than 20 minutes straight without discomfort.So when the band broke into the first banger of the night, Helicopter, a moderate number of people in the premium reserved seating stalls stood up to have a boogie. Nothing wild was going on – some head bopping, foot tapping – the usual Melbourne hipster dance moves.One of these pioneers happened to be an exceptionally tall man in the first few rows. And the audience member seated behind him wasnot having a bar of it. Cue shouting, gesturing and repeated attempts to make the dancer sit down.I’m only seeing bands I loved when I was 14. Am I in a musical rut – or is this growing up? | Sinéad StubbinsRead moreAs the show went on, this exchange erupted again and again. The dancer eventually shouted, arms opened wide in disbelief, “It’s a gig, mate! It’s a gig!”, while some of us in the rows behind them started chiming in with, “Let the man dance!”I observed this with some dismay. Now, I’ll be honest and admit that I have on occasion expressed annoyance at people standing in front of me at gigs. Not to them, obviously, because I’m not that entitled, but I’ve muttered a few choice words to my friends about how annoying it is when a dancer blocks my view. It is annoying. I’m very short and can almost never see the stage.But just because something annoys you doesn’t mean it’s actually “wrong” – and it certainly doesn’t mean that you’re entitled to ruin someone else’s experience at a public event where they’re really just doing what it says to do on the label.Buy a ticket to a gig? People might dance. Some people will dance while standing up. Not everyone who goes to aBloc Partyshow is going to be content to sit with their arms crossed and tap their feet as if they’re at the opera (I actually have no idea what people at the opera do).The thing that most struck me was that everyone at that show – and I feel confident saying this based on the fact that I didn’t see a single face that looked under 30 – was there because they loved the music in that special way that you do when it was the soundtrack to your coming of age.We all swayed to So Here We Are and we all screamed the words to Positive Tension – I’m sure many of us were remembering doing the exact same things at house parties when we were 17. It was a lovely moment of solidarity and common experience, the way that all live music always reminds me how special art is, and how lucky we are when we experience it together.So to have someone turn a good night into a nightmare because they can’t handle being in public with other people without trying to control their every movement was a real bummer. At the end of the show, every single person in our seated section surged to their feet to dance to Ratchet but the miserable man who had started the argument stayed seated, his every side crowded by dancing bodies. I hope making his point was worth it. He missed out on a very good boogie.Zoya Patel is a writer and editor based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsMusicOpinionPop and rockBloc PartyAustralian lifestylecommentShareReuse this content"

Yet delusional politicians from all parties seem intent on avoiding the issueThu 7 Aug 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 12.29 EDTShareTuition fees in England go up this year for the first time in eight years and the response from universities has ranged from tepid to dismayed. It’s not hard to see why: Russell Group analysisfoundthat the new amount of £9,535 a year – an increase of £285 – is a real-terms decrease of 26% since 2017.The value of the fees has been steadily eroding since 2012, and the original figure of a maximum of £9,000 a year was artificially low for many courses anyway.Universitiesstarted off cross-subsidising expensive courses whose costs weren’t met by nine grand a student with the cheaper, classroom-based ones, mainly humanities, which were running a surplus. Within a decade, those courses – such as history, law, English – were running at or near cost.As the value of the fees deteriorated in real terms, staff pay and conditions were sacrificed to keep things afloat; by 2021, the University and College Union (UCU) found that staff pay had decreased by one-fifth since 2009. Throughout, the sometimes astronomical fees paid by foreign students underpinned what was otherwise an unaffordable model. This introduced a lot of risk into the system – from our own governments, when they have gone to war against student visas, and from world events: student numbers were hit when the Nigerian currency started struggling, an event over which UK universities had no control.Put simply, we have a really strange system in higher education, where nobody admits how much things actually cost, nobody admits who’s paying for what, research is kept alive on the toil and goodwill of underpaid academics, foreign students who represent a huge export market and an incredible success story for the sector are treated as if they are somehow on the fiddle, and that’s before you even start to consider the matter we generally look at first: what this means for graduate debt.The student loan scheme is now on its eighth iteration since it was devised by the coalition government. Originally, it was designed to be generous, to mollify the Conservatives’ Liberal Democrat partners. Steadily, the maximum term from graduation has gone up (it’s now 40 years in England before your debt is wiped, no longer 30) and theearnings thresholdat which you start paying has gone down (it’s now £25,000). Even those changes don’t protect the government from the students who will never earn enough to repay – two years after the loans were formalised, parliamentestimatedthat 40% would never fully repay. By 2018, that figure hadgone upto 83% (though analysts stressed that they might repay some, but not all).You could argue that all this is the inevitable result of charging tuition fees at all, given that students in the US also labour under an astronomical amount of debt, whichtotalled$1.7tn at the start of this year. But the conditions we have created are murkier – unwilling to accept or discuss the impact student fees would have on equality of opportunity, we chose instead to insist that all universities offered degrees of the same financial value, and all courses cost the same, and delivered the same career benefits. This has thrown up some ridiculous consequences, in which the research that gives a university its standing has become increasingly unaffordable for all but the most prestigious institutions.Unable, meanwhile, to face the political consequences of a fees hike, successive governments have clung instead to the absurd proposition that education is somehow immune to inflation.Students in England now graduate with average debt of £53,000, data showsRead moreBut “student fees aren’t the problem”, Martin Lewissaidthis week on his podcast – an astonishing remark, given the problems they are mired in, yet also true, from the perspective of the household. Whichever way you slice it, paying back fees is tomorrow’s problem for the student; living costs, by contrast, are today’s problem for the family. There’s a separate loan available, but it’s means-tested based on family income and under-25s start to lose eligibility at a household income of only £25,000. To imagine such a household having the savings available to make up any gap is just fanciful; which fits the overall picture of a system running on avoidance and delusion.A graduate tax is sometimes floated as a more progressive alternative, based as it would be on what used to be understood as a foundational principle of public policy: that wealthier people can afford to contribute more. This, along with the idea of education as a public good, which we all benefit from even if we didn’t personally undertake it, has vanished from debate; yet nothing systematic or in any way realistic has replaced it.The idea of abandoning the fees experiment altogether, meanwhile, is the stuff dreams are made of because it would be unthinkably expensive. Yet the status quo we have arrived at could hardly be called cheap, unless your idea of thrift is to break a system that’s been centuries in the making.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTuition feesOpinionUniversitiesStudentsHigher educationEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

But in an era of climatic decline, it shows the resilience of our fellow speciesThu 7 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareButterflies flit across my vision wherever I go this summer. Screams of swifts have been unusually audible in cities. Hedges are laden with blackberries. Hordes of plump wood pigeons devour my kale. Fruit trees bow with plums and apples. There are wasps galore and each morning I’m woken by a raucous new neighbour: a herring gull that’s moved on to the factory roof next door.Wild nature, in Britain this year, is visibly abundant. Most of us share similar stories. But is there really a blizzard of butterflies? Are there actually more swifts? Is nature in recovery after years of decline? Or is this shifting baseline syndrome in action, whereby we are so inured to decimated levels of nature that we are deceived by tiny blips of hope?Restoration is a popular notion in modern conservation. In an era of entwining extinction and climatic crisis, it is not enough to protect the tiny pockets of nature we have left. We must create new wild spaces and revive lost species. If we could only restore anEmma Turneror a Philip Henry Gosse, they would scoff, or possibly weep, at my descriptions of abundance. Today’s wildlife spectacles would be thin gruel for a Victorian or Edwardian naturalist.And yet we need not scoff at hope. It is an intrinsic part of every encounter with the natural world. If they are not suffering, fellow species lift our hearts. When I see my local blackbirds as scruffy and hollow-eyed as the most sleep-deprived parents because they have successfully reared three broods this year, I can’t stop smiling. When I discover a pair of vanishingly rare Montagu’s harriers reared four young in a wheat field –the first British breeding success since 2019– it brings new hope: next year, there could be more.This year’s hopeful abundance is nothing to do with us, not yet. The summer of 2024 was a grim, sunless season following a cold spring. It was the second worst summer for butterflies since scientific recording began in 1976. The spring and summer of 2025 have been miraculously sunny. Britain’s sunniest-ever spring boasted43% more sunshine than average. Crucially, there were few, if any, spring frosts at night, and so plants thrived, blossom set, warmth-loving insects multiplied, birds fed and chicks fledged.Invertebrate populations can swiftly bounce back.Well-studied butterfliesare useful indicators of how other flying insects – bees, beetles, hoverflies – are faring. It’s beenthe best year for the purple emperor butterflyat Knepp in West Sussex since the former dairy farm was rewilded at the turn of the century. It’s the best year for gatekeeper butterflies in my garden since I moved in 11 years ago. Species teetering close to extinction from swallowtails to high brown fritillaries have done well in a few remaining strongholds.View image in fullscreenA small white butterfly in London this summer.Photograph: Butterfly Conservation/PAAnecdotal evidence awaits confirmation from scientific surveys but it looks like a vintage summer for most breeding birds. Anglers report one of the best supplies of fish this century on my local river. Every time I take a swim, I meet a kingfisher; I’ve never seen so many. The water is clear; aquatic plant growth is rampant.What this means for the big picture is not much. Temperature graphs still point up. Biodiversity graphsstill point down. But this sunny year reveals a profoundly hopeful tendency in our fellow species: open the door a tiny crack to animals, plants and fungi and they will stampede through it.If only we were as quick to take our chance, and repair some of the damage that human hegemony is doing to the planet. I’d love to declare that noticing nature this summer and celebrating its success is another instance of hope. The noticing is significant. Awareness can lead to action.We last noticed so much nature when we were locked down during Covid in the similarly dazzling spring of 2020. We appreciated the peace, birdsong and blossom. Many of us formed new bonds with neighbourhood nature. And then the data suggests most of us returned to our human-centric lives. We took a short holiday from gobbling up the planet before resuming the feast of late capitalism.Here’s another chance: we’ve been shown again how much joy, wellbeing and real growth there can be when we live among thriving nature.Country diary: It’s amazing what one family farm can do for wildlife | Andrea MeanwellRead morePolitically, nationally, there is less hope than ever for nature. Labour is wedded to a myopic version of economic growth that will bankrupt the planet. When a government won’t even oblige multibillion-profit-making builders toinstall one £35 nest brickin every new home to save swifts and other rapidly declining birds, we cannot expect it to lead the way in living more lightly on our planet. New infatuations with energy-hungry AI will onlyfurther squeeze nature.And yet locally there is more hope than ever for nature. There is more action than ever. So many of us are desperate to help our non-human neighbours. Neighbours sow wildflower meadows. Retirees build nest boxes. Councils declarerivers have rights. Companiesrewild land. Farmers rediscover nature-friendly food growing.We have to join this flowering, for us, our children and our planet. We can see from this summer that wild nature wants to flourish, is ready to blossom and will spring back to life, if only kind deeds create space where it can.Patrick Barkham writes for the Guardian on natural historyExplore more on these topicsWildlifeOpinionConservationBiodiversityBirdsButterfliesAnimalsInsectscommentShareReuse this content"

In fact, applied to government, they can offer new solutions for global problemsThu 7 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 06.44 EDTShareIf there is one thing that has marked the first year of Keir Starmer’s premiership, it is a propensity for control – whether it’s managing hisown party, cracking down on civil liberties andprotest, or instillingfear and anxietyin marginalised groups. For a centre-left party, the authoritarian strain Starmer has shown isn’t exactly in line with the “change” from the Tories that was promised.Governments seek to control populations, politicians seek to control their parties: this is nothing new and has been explicitly promoted since Machiavelli’s The Prince was published in 1532. When leaders understand holding power as an end in itself, and see the method as controlling those they have power over, they block themselves from being able to bring about real change, because not “losing control” becomes more important than any change they seek to create. And attempting to tightly control outcomes is ill suited to an increasingly complex and unstable world.At the same time, a different mode of control exists across the institutions that implement government policy. It is rules-based, promoted by steeply hierarchical structures fostering compliance, with rigid frameworks and inflexible mindsets, alongside a culture of overconfidence. These dynamics might seem benign or indeed necessary for a functioning bureaucracy. However, if out of balance, they can stifle the creative thinking and collaboration required to tackle complex challenges. Whether it isrunning consultationswithout the intention of deep engagement or listening, or an inability toincorporate the climate crisisinto economic frameworks, by seeking to maintain control, institutions fall short of making meaningful change.Or to put it bluntly, key performance indicators and top-down thinking, combined with overzealous control freakery in government, will not have a chance of tackling climate breakdown, the cost of living crisis, the mental health epidemic or the loss of trust in politics. This situation of overlapping crises is what academics like to call apolycrisis, characterised by radical uncertainty and wicked complexity.Coming out of the pandemic, there has been increased discussion amongpolicymakersrecognising the need to acknowledge uncertainty. The value of this is clear: areportcommissioned by the European Environment Agency and published in 2002 examined more than 100 years of policymaking, highlighting areas where uncertainty was not sufficiently acknowledged or taken into account when key decisions were made, such as during the BSE crisis. The authors concluded that, on many occasions, what was missing was the need for more humility in public policymaking about what was not known, stating: “Decision-making is faced with the continual prospect of surprise. This is the condition formerly known as ignorance.”When institutions don’t acknowledge what they don’t know, they are left exposed and unprepared, and leaders obsessed with control and certainty block themselves from taking seriously differing perspectives. These dynamics are not well suited to a world that is being upended, withfascismandecological collapseon our doorstep.Dear Keir Starmer, stop cosying up to Donald Trump – or he’ll drag Britain down with him | Simon TisdallRead moreHowever, the need for certainty and control isn’t confined to the halls of power. Across psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, evolutionary biology and strands of spirituality, it is recognised that our brains are wired for certainty.Neuroscience studiesshow that the brain responds to uncertainty as a fear-based threat, triggering the threat response centrecalled the amygdala. There is an evolutionary survival reason for this, to detect and react to danger: “How will I protect myself if I don’t know what’s coming at me?” Humans’ over-alert threat response is also shaped by culture and society. We have a political-media establishment that is happy to pump out ready opinions that are not only factually baseless and untrue, but also provoke our threat response. And in times of economic decline and uncertainty, there is an opportunity for far-right groups to hijack and trigger emotional and psychological reactions towards marginalised groups. When imaginary fears are adopted andpromoted by those in power, this isn’t a mistake: it is a way to control.The dominant mode of power that continues to operate in society, and certainly in the Labour party today, is “power over”, which is built on control, domination and coercion. Leadership exerts pressure and stress, which can often make our amygdala threat response fire off. People become paranoid and go into overdrive trying to control everything. To an extent, I understand these responses. As an overconfident 27-year-old when I took on a director role, I certainly had an urge to control everything. I had to work hard against that tendency in order to lead in a collaborative way. The phrase “holding uncertainty” was useful for me, because it meant I didn’t always trust my first reaction in situations, or the narratives my brain was telling me. It reminded me to take on board different opinions, rather than simply dismiss them. Of course I made mistakes, but I was also open to examining my own controlling and perfectionistic tendencies.“Embracing uncertainty” or “letting go” has been mostly limited to the pages of self-help books, but letting go on an individual level doesn’t make sense if you can’t pay your rent, or your family is getting deported. However, if we apply it to our institutions, power centres, systems and structures, it can be a direction of travel against authoritarianism, moving us towards co-creation, pluralist thinking that goes beyond siloed categories, and building coalitions against the far right. We are a quarter of the way through this century, and theIPCC climate change reportsays that global temperature increase could be up to 5.7C by 2100, making much of the world unliveable. At the same time, fascism is on the rise. Renewing our democracies, shifting to a healthier culture, tackling the climate crisis and reorienting the economy will only happen if we shift our culture and institutions away from control. We need to let go. What have we got to lose?Fran Boait is a leadership coach, freelancer and writerExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionClimate crisisThe far rightcommentShareReuse this content"

Suddenly he folds the paper up, sets it down on the table and looks across to his companion with weary exasperation. Why, he asks, does the high-minded New York Times refuse to accept that China is a turn-off?Just like George, many readers will at some stage probably have experienced a similar feeling. Perhaps it was about China, but perhaps about something completely different. Call it the “not right now” syndrome. It is the syndrome that recognises that a subject might be important, but reading a lengthy report about it can be another thing altogether.Journalists know from bitter experience that prisons are often a turn-off as well. Prisons are remote, often unpleasant places. Most people have never been inside one, and are happy to keep it that way. It is important that prisons exist, of course. They do a difficult but necessary job. Hopefully they do it well. In most respects, though, prisons are out of public sight and, as a result, out of public mind.Until they are not. Today is one of those times when “not right now” no longer cuts it. The reason is thepublication this weekof a truly devastating report by Anne Owers, the former chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales, on the mishandling of prison capacity. The report lays bare the reasons why prisons have become so consistently overcrowded over so many years to the point of frequent near-collapse. But, as it does so, it also makes clear that the underlying cause is neither a surge in human wickedness nor a rise in overzealous sentencing by the courts. Instead, the cause is bad and broken government.This is why the report, indispensable though it is for understanding the prisons crisis, is also important in a wider sense. It reads like an account of not just a government department on the verge of failure, but a whole nation state.Owers shows how overcrowding has its roots in a conflicted approach that has been deeply entrenched among generations of politicians. On the one hand, 21st-century governments have all promised more police and tougher sentences. On the other, they have all promised to cut departmental spending, to hold taxes down and to outsource programmes. As there arealmost no votersin prisons, the criminal justice system became a prime target for cuts. But the two policies were – and are – contradictory. The upshot was too many prisoners and not enough prisons or cells to house them in.This reached crisis point under Rishi Sunak’s government in October 2023, when Owers says the criminal justice system was within three days of meltdown. Early release schemes were hurriedly but grudgingly implemented. Many of the same pressures still exist under Labour today. Money is still tight and courts are still busy. Thepossibility of mass arreststhis weekend in response to Palestine Action protests is simply the latest example of the system’s lack of headroom.Owers has two particular criticisms of systemic government failings. The first is that the response to our prisons crisis between 2022 and 2024 was far too bureaucratic and repetitive. Several committees, often involving the same people, found themselves endlessly having the same discussions without triggering action. The second is that “surviving the day” then became the overriding preoccupation for government. The approach in the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), which oversees prisons policy, was to manage the crisis, doing “as little as possible as late as possible”.But there is a third, very important criticism lurking in her account. Ministers were far too slow and unwilling to face the facts. Sometimes this was true even within the MoJ itself, but the main resistance was from the Home Office, the Treasury and 10 Downing Street. The Home Office had an interest in talking tough and, as the former justice secretary Alex Chalk put it this week: “Some home secretaries’ egos will be writing cheques that the MoJ is expected to cash.” The Treasury tried to hold the line against all increased expenditure. No 10 played for time because it feared the political optics of early release schemes. The sum of these actions was government without leadership.Some of this has changed under Labour. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, did well by commissioning three important independent reports on different aspects of the criminal justice process – Owers on prison capacity,David Gauke on sentencing, and Sir Brian Leveson onthe criminal courts’ backlog– all of which (compare and contrast the Covid inquiry) have been briskly completed within a few months, their recommendations mainly accepted. The wider problems in Whitehall, however, remain. Mahmood still has to get all the changes in these reports past the Home Office, the Treasury and No 10, at a time when all three are preoccupied by Reform UK.Yet crisis processes and pressures are not in any way unique to the MoJ. On the contrary, they can apply across any part of government. Every Whitehall department has its hands tied by Treasury oversight. Think of the way the NHS, and thus the health department for England, moves into surviving-the-day mode as soon as winter looms. There are lessons in the Owers report for areas such as health and social care, welfare, policing, defence and education, as well as justice.All of this poses a collective challenge for the way that the British state is organised and does its business. It can be addressed, and perhaps answered, with skill and good fortune in one of two ways. One is by ever-more crisis management, in which, as Sam Freedman puts it inhis book Failed State, politicians and officials “keep using the machinery we have, making promises they can’t keep, pulling levers that aren’t there, filling newspapers with announcements of actions that never happen”. That approach is broken.The other approach is for a more draconian reform of priorities. The Owers report depicts a system that does not work. Yesterday’s report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchargued that, in her autumn budget, Rachel Reeves must either cut spending or raise taxes by more than £40bn if she is to balance the books without breaking Labour’s election promises. These are defining reminders of what is now at stake. It is foolish not to recognise that there are no easy choices here. The pitch has not been rolled with the public for change and the chances of success are uncertain. But it is no less foolish not to recognise – right now – that we cannot go on as we are.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsPrisons and probationOpinionUK criminal justiceRishi SunakConservativesShabana MahmoodcommentShareReuse this content"

As images proliferate at an unprecedented rate online, they risk losing their meaning, especially as AI poses a growing threat to the truth of what we see. We might ask why images of the relentlesskilling and devastation in Gaza, there for all to see, have not yet halted the slaughter of Palestinians.Into this situation comes Juergen Teller, “enfant terrible” of 1990s fashion photography, who has produced acoffee-table bookabout the Nazis’ concentration and extermination camp in Auschwitz. This goes some way beyond his usual remit. Teller is known for his knack for making pretty things look ugly, as a shorthand for “authenticity”, associated with the grunge aesthetic and so-called “heroin chic”, which made him the most in-demand fashion photographer of his era.The book, titled simply Auschwitz Birkenau, is published by the biggest German art book publisher, Steidl, with a cover designed by Peter Saville, the man behind so much revered Joy Division and Factory Records artworkWhat is actually in the book? Photography-wise, it is fairly bland, documenting the site as it stands today, preserved as a monument against forgetfulness as the Memorial and Museum of Auschwitz-Birkenau.The selection could have been taken from an anonymous Flickr account. Like an overbearing tourist, Teller photographs every single thing he sees in Oświęcim, the town where the camp is located: from the electronic parking plates and tacky hot baguette parlours to the details of the gas chambers.There’s no hierarchy. But the haste is visible. All the pictures – more than 800 in total – were taken on an iPhone, and with stupefying simplicity: close shot of the barracks, details, then a panorama; a close shot of empty Zyklon B cans, then a wider shot, a panorama; and again and again in the same way. He uses the same approach for a pseudo-poignant “perspective through the barbed wire” photograph, and wistful closeups of melting snow-covered grass.The photographs are interspersed with memories of former prisoners, collected by Christoph Heubner, the executive vice-president of the International Auschwitz Committee, who invited Teller to carry out this project, and who is also behind the Gerhard Richter Birkenaupavilion,an exhibition spacewhich opened in Oświęcim last year.View image in fullscreenJuergen Teller during London Fashion Week in February 2023.Photograph: Kirstin Sinclair/Getty ImagesTeller’s book caught my attention precisely because of Huebner’s involvement, as it made me wonder: why would you invite a celebrity artist – a German one at that – to document Auschwitz? The problem with Teller’s book is not that he’s famous, nor that his most famous work is in fashion – it’s that these photographs contribute nothing to a deeper understanding of Auschwitz. The pictures are totally unremarkable, and get nowhere near what new photography of Auschwitz ought to strive for: to refocus our attention on something previously unnoticed.Perhaps you could argue that this is a deliberate strategy, and a more thoughtful one – for Teller to suspend his own personal style and render himself invisible. Except that he isn’t invisible. In one of the former barracks, block 27, there’s a special interactive installation devoted to various nations’ experience of extermination, including a Yad Vashem-inspired “Book of Names”: a library of books containing the name of every single documented Auschwitz victim (it is ever-expanding). And what does he do with it? He photographs all the pages with the surname “Teller” on it. Of course, thousands of German-born Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. But to single out your own name is not a gesture of solidarity – it’s narcissism.As perpetrators, the Germans strictly controlled any photographic evidence of the extermination, ensuring no documentation escaped the walls of the death camps. Indeed, there is a vital and ongoing debate about whether photography is an appropriate way to address theHolocaustat all, given that the original photographic record does not exist.Earlier this year, the Auschwitz Memorial established adigital replicaof the camp, prompted by growing interest from film-makers (at present, only documentaries are permitted to be filmed there). The only known pictures of the extermination camps are the fourSonderkommando photographs, secretly taken by Jewish prisoners and smuggled out, which have become the subject of the Gerhard Richter paintings on display at the Oświęcim pavilion.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kahane supplements this with photographs of a contemporary neo-Nazi demonstration, pointing our attention towards the real and ongoing problem of antisemitism in Germany.What if the most human thing is in fact to refrain from forming an image? Kahane’s empty canvases point to a broader crisis around how to represent the Holocaust. Richter’s approach introduces unnecessary pathos, making the evil universally human, rather than an act committed by a specific nation nurtured in a specific culture. But at least it arguably opens an interesting philosophical argument.No such thing can be said about Teller’s Auschwitz Birkenau book. His view of the camp is banal, or occasionally sentimental (pictures of souvenir kitsch included). In a moment where the very legacy of the Holocaust is being politicised, it is detached and generalising, blurring notions of responsibility, while seeming worryingly like a vanity project.Visiting Auschwitz has become too easy a way for Germans and other nations alike to show how far they’ve come; that they’re now free of antisemitism. With Teller’s book in hand, maybe even that won’t feel necessary to some. As artists and as societies, we bear a responsibility to history. If Auschwitz is allowed to become an increasingly empty symbol, and we lose our ability to capture the horror of the Holocaust, how are we going to ensure that future generations understand that it really happened?Agata Pyzik is a critic and author of Poor but Sexy: Culture Clashes in Europe East and West.

Of course, maybe you live your life balls-free – but perhaps you know a dog? If that dog has balls, then I have terrible news: the scientists who found microplastic particles in every single human testicle in their study found them in all the dogs’ balls, too.Patriarchy, not for the first time, you have seriously let me down.The life of microplastic: how fragments move through plants, insects, animals – and youRead moreRaised from birth in western society, I have been passively inculcated with a relentless message that protecting your balls was our most important collective priority. Freud insisted that male identity was so rooted in the symbolism of aggressively functional genitalia that “castration anxiety” mobilised men into behaviours of dominance, control and whatever other compensatory masculine unpleasantness Donald Trump got up to this morning.When the boss was “busting your balls”, it was bad. If a situation “had you by the balls” it was bad. When a woman was a “ball-busting bitch”, she was unforgivable.“Genital theft panic” is an actual term used by actual anthropologists to describe the social terror of something nefarious stealing function from your soft bits when you’re not looking.So, here I was thinking, “Ah, yes, I don’t expect the patriarchy to care thatscientistshave found synthetic plastics in blood, placenta and breast milk, contributing toplacental dysfunction, ovarian atrophy,endometrial hyperplasiaandfibrosisin women – because I’m a feminist with pattern recognition.I don’t expect the patriarchy gives much more thought to the plastic pollution of waterways, the poisoning of animals, or the fact that there has been a trash island named theNorth Atlantic Garbage Patch– now hundreds of kilometres across – growing in the ocean since 1972. But now that there are microplastics in your balls with considerable evidence suggesting they are reducing your sperm count, inflaming your tissues and affecting both your and our species’ fertility, surely some good old-fashioned genital theft panic will kick in and patriarchy will aggressively – with much swagger – ride in to save what it holds dear.I repeat – you’ve let me down. Because, given the opportunity to literallysave your own balls,you’ve instead defaulted to a significantly less useful habit of “bullying people who utter uncomfortable truths” at conferences whenever the plastic problem is mentioned.Experts trying to communicate to the world that the projected tripling of plastic products by 2060 is a catastrophically dumbarse ideasay they have beenyelled at, harassed and intimidated by representatives of petrochemical lobbies and petrostates who make money from the ubiquitous fossil fuel-based pollution product.This is the sixth attempt at a plastic pollution treaty since plastic started turning up inbrains, livers, kidneys, blood, joints and your balls, and the UN decided “hey, maybe this is a problem?” back in 2022. The previousfive attemptshave failed.Well may some men fear that the radical humanity of feminism will deprive them of status, power and even identity – but it’s not the sisterhood busting your balls, fellas. It’s chiefly the fossil-fuel interests of usual suspects like China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US in the form of 460m tonnes of synthetic garbage spewed on to the planet every year.Now microplastics are found everywhere from the peak of Mt Everest to the depths of theMariana Trench.

What things did your parents say to you that makeyou proud and have stuck with you over the years?Fran_MMalice: Creating that song was a very emotional time and it cut real deep, but to be able to journal the grief from losing both our parents into a piece of art was also healing. I believe it’s a song that is going to resonate with a lot of people, because whether we like it or not, most of us are going to end up outliving our parents. This is something always in the back of your mind, you know? Already, a lot of people are coming up to us on the street and saying: thank you, that song helped me to grieve. The Birds Don’t Sing isn’t just our story, it’s everybody’s story.Pusha T: In hindsight I believe my mom was leaving breadcrumbs and doing all these little things in order to let us know she didn’t have long left. She was mapping, planning and vocalising specific things before she passed away. It was her way of saying goodbye, you know? It was super important to detail all of that, because it gave me and my brother a sense of peace.Malice: No doubt. In terms of specific things our parents said? Well, you know, my dad always instilled in us the idea that honesty is the best policy! That you have to go through life being as truthful as possible and to always try to show integrity in your character. I remember mom was always big on us truly being brothers and looking out for one another, no matter what. That advice still resonates to this day and with the energy of this album.How did you guysdevelop your signature diction and wit as writers?MaximFlathPusha T: To me the most gangster shit in the world is when you’re having a really cutting conversation and looking directly into someone’s eyes. To be able to embody a coldness without being over the top. Like Tony Soprano might smack somebody up, but the most gangster part is when he’s just lucidly speaking to his therapist, you know? My rapping style is a lot like that.Thomas Hobbs: What about horror? Because you often sound like a horror bogeyman when you are rapping.Pusha T:I always liked the energy of the old horror movies. Like The Omen and The Exorcist, where a lot of it is based on these eerie conversations and they didn’t need special effects [to scare you].TH: Would you say coming from a musical household was a big part of shaping your style as well?Malice: Remember the movie Crooklyn by Spike Lee? The scene where all the brothers and sisters are watching Soul Train and American Bandstand? That was the perfect depiction of how musical our household was. By the time we moved to Virginia, I told my mom I wanted a microphone, a beat machine, a turntable, a Gemini mixer with the reverb on it. My mom literally forced my dad to buy it all for me, because he was much more dismissive at first and said things like: “Why do you need all that?Rapain’t even gonna be here for that long, son!” Music was always a big part of our upbringing. If I just think about our house then the living room was filled with hundreds of vinyl records from all genres. That was the foundation. You know that I recently found all those records and got them back?Pusha T: No, I didn’t know that.View image in fullscreenClipse in 2003.Photograph: Gregory Bojorquez/Getty ImagesMalice:It was literally tons of vinyl. Look: if my parents would argue, someone would go downstairs and put a record on full volume to drown out the noise. Music was always the backdrop and there tended to be cousins dancing in our house.Malice,you are a man of God and so am I; I’m a woman, actually.I love hip-hop, but sometimes the lyrics, imagery and messaging feels so spiritually off. How do you navigate that as a Christian?LoveFromLagosMalice: The gospel tells us about the war between the spirit and the flesh. It talks about these constant contradictions, and how helpless we all are as long as we are in this flesh. The flesh and the spirit are always at enmity with one another. So, we are all walking contradictions, right? The thing about morality is that you’re only good until you’re not. It’s not supposed to be a juggling act: we all try to do the right thing, but there’s going to be circumstances where we fall short. There is part of the scripture from the apostle Paul, who says: “For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do – this I keep on doing. Who will rescue me from this body of death?” It shows that we are all sinners and we all fall short. That’s what being human is all about.View image in fullscreen‘If I diss someone, it’s a very real thing to me’ … Clipse at the BET Hip Hop awards in 2022.Photograph: Terence Rushin/Getty ImagesAnd Pusha, you’ve been very candid abouthow things ended with Kanye’s GOOD Music label. While I understand you went through a lot of challenges, can you mention some of the good times?LovefromLagosPusha T: Just as a rap aficionado, well, being there was special! Creating So Appalled and New God Flow were some of my favourite memories. The Good Friday series, that was crazy, too. The albums I dropped during that time, like Daytona and It’s Almost Dry, they are very, very strong offerings. It goes without saying that me and Ye made great things together.Do you think there’ll ever be another collab between you and Ye?JooooooojPusha T: Yeah, that’s in the past. That’s definitely in the past.TH: But if one of your rap enemies ever apologised, could you let it go?Pusha T: I’m not mad at anybody. I’m good. I’m happy. But at the same time I don’t know if I necessarily want to work with those people either. I’m cool with how all of this has played out. If I diss someone it’s a very real thing to me. Like I watch rappers uses disses as a gimmick and shit like that, but that ain’t what it is for me.There is always a lot of humour and brilliant scene setting in your lyrics. Have you ever thought about writing a screenplay?HhhhssssMalice: Writing a screenplay for aClipsebiopic movie is a must. A lot of people would like to see that film. Right now, we’re seeing rappers fall to the federal government or they’re losing their lives because of drug addictions and out-of-control egos. But there’s a lot to learn from our lives, especially the way me and my brother have navigated the pitfalls of the business and always tried to make the best possible decisions.View image in fullscreen‘We always tried to make the best possible decisions’ … Pusha T(left), Pharrell Williams and Malice.Photograph: KMazur/WireImageWho had the best verse onLet God Sort Em Out?BezosofthenasalsPusha T: I don’t know if I have a personal favourite verse on the album to be honest, maybe it’s my Ace Trumpets verse. I wish I had rapped what Malice said on Mike Tyson Blow to the Face:“Only 300 bricks can make you Leonidas.”Pusha, I think I saw you performing with Kelis when she supported U2 in 2001. What was your experience of those shows?SharmadelicaPusha T: U2 were so fucking cool, man! I remember it was a super big deal to be touring with them at that time, and it was one of my first real experiences on a big stage. For U2, tour life is about five-star catering; runners who will go grab you whatever you ask for; and random vans that will take you anywhere in the city. These dudes had manicures, pedicures, massages! Touring with U2 seriously fucked up my expectations, bro. Because when you go out and tour for real as a rapper, the reality can be a very gruelling thing.Malice: Wait, hold up, can I share my own Bono interaction? I met him backstage around the time I converted from Malice to No Malice and found God. I remember Bono said to me: “You have this righteous anger now and you have to go do something with it!” That always stuck with me. It kind of gave me the green light, and what Bono said is always in the back of my mind around not abandoning my convictions. Bono is a good dude.What are each of your favourite albums of all time?FionnmckMalice: Listen, I love the Killers, I love Red Hot Chili Peppers, even Billy Joel! When I work out in the gym, I have Coldplay playing, or U2’s The Joshua Tree. It’s funny, because when I watched MTV back in the 1980s, David Bowie was always on there. All these years later and Bowie is still at the forefront today. I think that says something about true talent and how it can carry on through the ages. It even outlasts your death.Pusha T:I’m always torn between Mobb Deep’s The Infamous, Raekwon’s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Jay-Z’s Reasonable Doubt, and Biggie’s Life After Death. I can drive anywhere in the world with those four albums and I will be happy.View image in fullscreen‘We’ve definitely got more music in store’ … Clipse in 2007.Have you watched much British TV/film? If so, what have you liked and why?Jajones7Pusha T: [Loud laughter] Definitely Benny Hill! Benny was running around with women on late night TV! My older brother was always watching him, laughing, and I would sneak in. And what’s my other man called … um,Rowan Atkinson? Mr Bean, right? That dude was ill.Do you still write your rhymes? If so, do you prefer handwritten, typing on the phone, or both? Do you have any particular rituals when writing or recording?WzrdwthwrzfMalice: For me it’s about building a verse line-by-line throughout the day. It might start off in the shower, continue while I am driving, and then when I get to the studio I put it all together. It is always pen and paper with a pristine notebook. If I mess up on the writing, I am gonna rip out the page and start over.Pusha T: I can only write things down to be honest, because I am a very visual person. I don’t know how to do the whole spontaneous freestyle thing, because I am always second guessing myself. I am a perfectionist and so that involves editing a lot. I might come up with a good bar, but I will keep going back to it and working out how to make it fresher.What can we expect from the duo in the future? Is this the end?CClarke2005Pusha T: We’ve definitely got more music in store, baby.Malice: [Laughs knowingly] Nah, we got it. We’ve definitely got it!Let Got Sort Em Out is out now on Roc Nation.

Ahead of Anemone, directed by his son Ronan, we gorge on Day-Lewis’s back catalogueByRyan GilbeyThu 7 Aug 2025 08.10 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 15.04 EDTShare21. Stars and Bars (1988)Perhaps keen not to be pigeonholed in high-fibre roles,Daniel Day-Lewistook on a pair of zany culture-clash comedies (the other was Eversmile, New Jersey) that featured him singing in a bubble bath. In Stars and Bars, he is a prim English art expert who travels to the American south to retrieve a Renoir from its owner (Harry Dean Stanton) and butts heads with various irksome oddballs. Playing the sort of nitwit that would become Hugh Grant’s meal-ticket, Day-Lewis proves that wackiness is not in his wheelhouse.20.Nine(2009)The movie of the Broadway musical of Fellini’s 8½ is one of only two duds on the Day-Lewis CV. Surrounded by dazzling female actors (Nicole Kidman, Penélope Cruz, Judi Dench, Sophia Loren), he ends up making heavy weather of Guido, the bewildered auteur caught at a creative impasse. A light touch eludes him: he’s no Marcello Mastroianni, that’s for sure.19. Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971)Day-Lewis in Sunday Bloody Sunday.Photograph: YoutubeJohn Schlesinger’s bisexual love-triangle drama gave Day-Lewis his film debut at the age of 14. He is briefly shown sauntering along a row of parked cars, scratching the paintwork with a broken bottle. The delinquent behaviour, the insouciant look, the south London setting: this could be a teenage snapshot of Johnny from My Beautiful Laundrette.18. Nanou (1986)View image in fullscreen‘Delon-level dashing’ … Day-Lewis with Imogen Stubbs in Nanou.Photograph: Umbrella-Caulfield/Nffc/Curzon/Kobal/ShutterstockTen minutes or so of screen time doesn’t give Day-Lewis much chance to make an impression as the debonair ex of young Nanou (Imogen Stubbs). He finds her in France, where she has fallen in with a would-be terrorist, but says “au revoir” shortly after. Still, he looks Delon-level dashing in a raincoat.17. Gandhi (1982)Like Sunday Bloody Sunday, another hooligan cameo for Day-Lewis. He gets dialogue this time, all of it racist, as he tries to intimidate the young Gandhi, played by Ben Kingsley. Movies in which Day-Lewis played a more prominent role have attracted no shortage of Oscar nominations, but Gandhi is the only one of his to have walked off with the best picture prize.16.The Bounty(1984)Pauline Kael was one of Day-Lewis’s early champions but she argued that he “stuck out” and “seemed like a bad actor” in this version of Mutiny on the Bounty. In his big scene, he is furiously reprimanded by Anthony Hopkins as Captain Bligh. Equally noteworthy is the sight of Day-Lewis sharing the screen for the first time with one of his own acting heroes, Phil Davis. Also among the Bounty’s crew is the comic John Sessions: inGangs of New York, Sessions would play an actorplayingAbraham Lincoln, and getting harangued and pelted for his troubles by Day-Lewis.15. Eversmile, New Jersey (1989)View image in fullscreenUp to his teeth … in Eversmile.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyIn his second stab at fish-out-of-water comedy, Day-Lewis is an over-zealous Irish travelling dentist given to philosophical musings (“Did we somehow mislay our genetic memory or did God just forget to give us better teeth?”) as he brings good brushing technique to Argentina courtesy of the DuBois Foundation for the Development of Dental Consciousness. Tending to priests, peasants and gangsters alike, he roams the land on his motorcycle and sidecar, gets chased by multiple Santa Clauses, falls for a woman on the run from her wedding, and finally declares: “The world is collapsing! And I have an erection!”14. The Crucible (1996)View image in fullscreenIll-fated dalliance … Day-Lewis with Winona Ryder in The Crucible.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarPut Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder together on screen and it never works out well for their characters (see also: The Age of Innocence). In Arthur Miller’s by-the-book adaptation of his own ageless play about the Salem witch trials, Day-Lewis is the farmer John Proctor, who pays a heavy price for dallying with young Abigail (Ryder). It was through the making of the film, directed by Nicholas Hytner, that Day-Lewis first met Miller’s daughter, Rebecca, whom he married at the end of 1996, and with whom he had two of his three children, including Ronan, co-writer and director of Anemone.13. The Boxer (1997)View image in fullscreenPacking a punch … in The Boxer.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarTraining under Barry McGuigan, Day-Lewis boxed twice a day, seven days a week, for nearly three years to prepare to play the IRA soldier who embraces his pugilist roots after serving 14 years in prison. More inflammatory is his rekindled romance with his teenage sweetheart, who happens to be another prisoner’s wife, played by Emily Watson. In his third film for Jim Sheridan, Day-Lewis gives a hushed, coiled performance (he doesn’t lose his rag until the 85-minute mark). It heralded his first retirement – after this, he didn’t make another film for five years – but is not exactly what you’d call going out on a high.12.A Room with a View(1985)View image in fullscreen‘Uptight prig’ … in A Room with a View.Photograph: Goldcrest/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockCentral to the rise of Day-Lewis was the timing of this Merchant-Ivory adaptation of EM Forster’s novel, which opened immediately after My Beautiful Laundrette. Hard to imagine a better illustration of his range than the back-to-back sight of the sensually swaggering Johnny in Laundrette and the uptight prig Cecil Vyse in Room. The moment when jilted Cecil stands with his shoe in his hand was all Day-Lewis’s idea. “If you take your shoes off in a situation in which you’re vulnerable,” he said, “you’ll feel 10 times more vulnerable.” Spoken like the shoemaker he would eventually become during his first retirement.11.In the Name of the Father(1993)As Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four who were wrongly convicted and imprisoned for the 1974 IRA pub bombing, Day-Lewis goes from impish troublemaker to broken wreck and finally folk hero. Terrific to see him sharing the screen again with Phil Davis: this time, Davis is a brute putting the screws on him in the interrogation room. And the scene in which Gerry brutally castigates his father, Giuseppe (Pete Postlethwaite), when the two of them are cooped up together in the same cell, remains blistering. Ultimately, this is a moral work rather than a cinematic one, and there is nothing much for Day-Lewis to play in the final hour but righteousness.10. Phantom Thread (2017)Less a coherent movie than a string of eye-catching confrontations, Day-Lewis’s second collaboration with Paul Thomas Anderson – and the catalyst for his second retirement – casts him as Reynolds Woodcock, a fastidious and imperious 1950s dressmaker. Fun though the standoffs are, especially Reynolds’s hilariously disproportionate hissy fit after his asparagus is cooked in butter rather than oil and salt, the movie is little more than an arthouse Devil Wears Prada, with Day-Lewis in Meryl Streep mode and everyone else (bar Lesley Manville, superb as his indomitable sister) running scared.9. Lincoln (2012)Day-Lewis won his third best actor Oscar for a mesmerising performance as the president trying to pass the 13th amendment, which outlawed slavery, as the civil war rages. Under Steven Spielberg’s direction, he brings a lolling looseness to lines that sound as if they’ve only just occurred to him. A simple scene depictingLincolnmeeting wounded soldiers in hospital is rendered moving by the actor’s unforced affability, his warming burr. His charisma makes you understand why the soldiers would get a kick simply from standing in his shadow.8.The Ballad of Jack and Rose(2005)Nothing to do with Titanic, the Jack and Rose here are a father and daughter, played by Day-Lewis and Camilla Belle respectively, whose off-the-grid lifestyle is jeopardised when Jack’s girlfriend (Catherine Keener) comes to stay, bringing her teenage sons (Paul Dano and Ryan McDonald). Under the direction of his wife, the novelist and film-maker Rebecca Miller, Day-Lewis exudes grumpy charm as the Scottish immigrant whose love for his daughter grows gradually suffocating and even unsavoury. Two years before he and Day-Lewis locked horns spectacularly on screen inThere Will Be Blood, Dano comes off badly in their fracas in a treehouse. It was Dano’s fine work here that prompted the senior actor to recommend him to Paul Thomas Anderson for that movie.7. The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988)View image in fullscreen‘Wry, carnivorous sexual magnetism’ … with Juliette Binoche in The Unbearable Lightness of Being.Photograph: Ronald GrantPhilip Kaufman’s ambitious film of Milan Kundera’s novel about the Prague Spring contains a lead performance for which Day-Lewis has expressed regret. Though the script was in English, he learned Czech but still found himself out of his depth as the priapic brain surgeon Tomas: “It was something to do with language. The idea of speaking English with a Czech accent meant it wasn’t coming from anywhere.” Accept that touch of inauthenticity and it’s still possible to savour Day-Lewis’s wry, carnivorous sexual magnetism, and the pitiful sight of Tomas’s spirit being crushed by the political regime and the betrayals it demands. Other pluses: that mane of liquorice-coloured hair, and the actor’s tingling rapport with Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin.6. Gangs of New York (2002)It was Leonardo DiCaprio who coaxed Day-Lewis out of his first retirement during a stroll in Central Park. The young star’s reward? To be comprehensively acted off the screen. As bullyboy William Cutting, aka Bill the Butcher, Day-Lewis isn’t merely the dominant presence in Martin Scorsese’s misshapen, mid-19th-century gangster thriller: he is its sole source of dynamism. In stove-pipe hat, flapping trenchcoat and with an American eagle printed on his glass eye, he looks like the Babadook’s sleazy uncle, giving off strong proto-Trumpian energy as he decries “the foreign hordes defiling” his land. There’s also a nice Day-Lewis Cinematic Universe crossover when he strides through a crowd of anti-Lincoln protesters and lobs a knife that hits a portrait of the president he would portray a decade later. He also gets to describe Ireland, his real-life off-screen love, as “an excrementous isle”.5. The Last of the Mohicans (1992)View image in fullscreenBorn to be wild … in The Last of the Mohicans.Photograph: Allstar Collection/Cinetext/20 C/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe method actor as matinee idol. Even those who haven’t seen Michael Mann’s stylish, swoon-worthy take on the James Fenimore Cooper novel will know the lengths to which Day-Lewis went to portray Hawkeye, adoptive son of a Mohican chief. He lived wild for weeks, ate only what he could hunt or forage, learned to load a rifle while running through the forest and built his own canoe. The North Carolina landscapes are ravishing, though they risk being upstaged by the magnificence of the actor’s mighty brow and glossy tresses as he darts among the trees in slow-mo. Then there isthatemphatic demand to Madeleine Stowe: “Stay alive, no matter what occurs! Iwillfind you!” Who could possibly disobey?4. My Beautiful Laundrette (1985)View image in fullscreen‘Brooding, funny, horny’ … with Gordon Warnecke in My Beautiful Laundrette.Photograph: Ronald Grant‘It was a buddy movie – and then they kissed’: Stephen Frears and Hanif Kureishi on My Beautiful Laundrette at 40Read moreScreenwriter Hanif Kureishi saw the influence of Clint Eastwood on Day-Lewis’s minimalist performance as Johnny, the gay former thug who helps spruce up a London launderette. Director Stephen Frears thought he was more like Marlene Dietrich. The actor described it as “the first film that I ever passionately wanted to do”. Hence the letter he wrote to Frears (“I know you think I come from a public-school background but I’ve got very nasty friends”) in which he threatened to break the director’s legs if he didn’t give him the part. It worked. As did his brooding, funny, horny performance. A star was born right there among the suds.3. The Age of Innocence (1993)View image in fullscreen‘Tortured panache’ … with Michelle Pfeiffer in The Age of Innocence.Photograph: Columbia/AllstarThe critic Jonathan Romney floated the theory that Newland Archer, the elegant lawyer played by Day-Lewis in Martin Scorsese’s rapturous adaptation of Edith Wharton’s study of late-19th century New York mores, was a “soul brother” to Jake La Motta in Raging Bull: “He simply wears fancier gloves.” There is certainly a seam of cunning and coldness in Day-Lewis’s performance, but there is boyish wonder too, especially in the gasping, enchanted laugh he lets slip whenever Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) does something irreverent or iconoclastic. As Archer tries to expedite his marriage to her cousin May (Winona Ryder) in an attempt to quell his feelings for the countess, Day-Lewis strikes and sustains a note of tortured panache.2.My Left Foot(1989)Two contradictory things are true of Jim Sheridan’s film about the artist and writer Christy Brown, who was born with cerebral palsy. One: there is no excuse for a disabled actor not to have been cast in the role. And two: Day-Lewis – who won his first Oscar for this – is astonishing in it. The first of three projects with Sheridan, this marked the beginnings of the Daniel Day-Loopy PR machine, as stories abounded of the lengths to which he went to stay authentically in character: never leaving his wheelchair, having to be carried over the cables on set, contorting his body so fiercely that he broke two ribs during filming. The movie hasn’t endured as well as it might: it ends on a happy-ever-after with Brown’s future-wife Mary Carr, who, it waslater allegedby his biographer Georgia Louise Hambleton, isolated and abused him.1. There Will Be Blood (2007)View image in fullscreenAwe-inspiring … as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood.Photograph: Miramax/Sportsphoto/AllstarThe comedian Adam Riches once called Day-Lewis “the greatest actor never to appear in anyone’s favourite film”. Paul Thomas Anderson’s awe-inspiring character-study-disguised-as-an-epic gives the lie to that quip. Speaking in the corroded rumble of John Huston’s Noah Cross from Chinatown (another monstrous devourer of people and land alike), Day-Lewis is extraordinary as Daniel Plainview, a rapacious early-20th century Californian oil prospector. In a performance that can be summed up as long overcast periods interrupted by all hell breaking loose, usually with Paul Dano on the receiving end as the pipsqueak preacher who is Plainview’s sole adversary, Day-Lewis doesn’t make us like Plainview or even understand his cruelty, but we absolutely believe in him. And, as with all great monster movies, we are eager to see what he breaks next. After nearly three hours in his company, audiences are likely to develop a severe case of Stockholm syndrome.Explore more on these topicsRankedDaniel Day-LewisPhantom ThreadLincolnGangs of New YorkThe Last of the MohicansThe Age of InnocencefeaturesShareReuse this content"

This would not be that remarkable – plenty of people go overseas for concerts, as tickets often go for much less than in the US (any dedicated Swiftie will tell you it was much cheaper to see her in Mexico City than, say, LA) – if not for the fact that Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, planned ahead for an influx of outsiders to the island. The first nine dates of his landmark 30-show residency at San Juan’s Coliseo de Puerto Rico were reserved exclusively for island residents, who had to present proof of residency at one of nine locations, primarily agricultural markets. Only afterward could anyone from the outside attend the Puerto Rican superstar’s show, NoMe Quiero Ir de Aquí (I Don’t Want to Leave Here), a three-hour magnum opus of Boricua pride in support of his new album Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Pictures).Bad Bunny at Coachella review – charismatic superstar hosts high-energy partyRead moreIn the nearly 10 years sinceBad Bunnybroke containment on Soundcloud, he has made defiance of norms and expectations a personal rule. From donning drag in the Yo Perreo Sola video, to seamlessly blending genres old and new, to his refusal to sing or conduct press in English – even his appearances on Saturday Night Live, one of several forays into English media, kept Spanish as the default – Martínez has thrillingly redefined what it looks like to be a global superstar. His residency in San Juan, the triumphant opening salvo of a world tour that will entirely skip the mainland US, is not just the latest bucked model but, I’d argue, the best use of megastardom in recent memory, an application of generational celebrity that unites potent symbolism with actual material change.With a capacity crowd of about 18,000 fans each night, the 21 dates of No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí open to non-residents are expected to bring 400,000 people to San Juan, two-thirds of them from overseas. The whole residency will inject about $200m into the long-suffering local economy – enough to bump up Puerto Rico’s GDP by 0.15%. The boon would feel at odds with Martínez’s mocking of thoughtless visitors in songs like Turista, if he did not also take steps to redirect the usual flow of American dollars on an island the US keeps in perpetual and extractive colonial purgatory. Tickets outside Puerto Rico are given premium price – at the moment, they cost $600 or more, on par with decent seats for Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter or Taylor Swift’s The Eras Tour – and come bundled with rooms in locally owned hotels during the off-season. The deal is intended to dissuade visitors from booking one of the Airbnbs transforming the island into asecond-property investment havenpricing out local residents, particularly in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017.View image in fullscreenBad Bunny’s No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí residency.Photograph: Edgardo Medina/NurPhoto/ShutterstockMaria profoundly affected Martínez, who grew up an hour outside San Juan in Vega Baja, and has spent his career atop the global streaming charts redirecting the spotlight toward the archipelago’s issues, fromchronic blackoutsto tax breaks for outsiders, as well as celebrating itsrich historyandfluid diaspora. The new showopenswith a slew of national facts broadcast in Spanish, from the serious to the cheeky – “San Juan is one of the oldest cities in the Americas. It was founded in 1521” as well as “Sancocho cures anything, according to our grandmothers.” It featureslavish sets– built by 1,000 local workers – evoking the lush hills and beaches of the island, as well as a whole traditional casita. The show has, unsurprisingly, provoked an outpouring ofcatharsisandcelebrationfrom the thousands within the Puerto Rican diaspora who have attended, and confirmed a core principle of the whole residency: this is for Puerto Rico, specifically and broadly. People like me – non-Hispanic English speakers who found Bad Bunny’s music far away from his homeland, who groove without fully understanding the lyrics – can participate, but they will not be the center.All of this is, ultimately, one of the most interesting and thoughtful flexes of celebrity power, particularly at the time when the economics of live music feel so precarious. While smaller artists scrabble tomake the money work, and venues struggle to keep their bottom line, the biggest artists compete to put on increasingly elaborate shows, forincreasingly exorbitant prices. Tickets to Bad Bunny’s residency for US residents still run easily into the thousands of dollars, but at least with a political point. This is an artist who has routinely eschewed US centrism, who posted a video to his Instagram referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents as “sons of bitches” who can’t leave “people alone and working”. In an interview withVariety, he deemed touring the mainland US at this time “unnecessary”, as fans there have had ample opportunity to see him in the past six years. (For instance, 32 American stops for 2022’s World’s Hottest tour, including two sold-out nights at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx.)He’s right, and even from afar – the tickets are, unfortunately, out of my price range, though I would pay good money to see one of our most electrifying and charismatic performers on stageagain– it is thrilling to witness. “Before the residency, my fantasy for the longest time was to do a massive free show in Puerto Rico that could be locals only,” Martínez told Variety. “And if it were up to me, all of the shows for the locals would be free, but what we’ve got planned now is next level.” The dream is ultimately improbable, for an artist of his stature and for it to be safe. But he’s gotten as close as a superstar can get.Explore more on these topicsBad BunnyPop and rockPuerto RicocommentShareReuse this content"

Where else will you get explosions, witches and lacy ruffs all on the same bill? Step right up to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery for The World of James VI and I. James has become more box-office friendly lately, because of his passionate friendships with a series of male favourites, including the Duke of Buckingham, as seen on TV. You’ll find portraits of his favourite men here, the lushest by far being Rubens’ 1625 painting of Buckingham, his cheeks flushed, moustache neatly upturned, eyes flashing. There’s an astrological watch, too, in an egg-shaped silver case that James presented to another favourite, the Earl of Somerset.This exhibition refuses, however, to pin down the exact nature of James’s sexuality, seeing it as just part of his times. When his voyage home from Elsinore Castle with his new bride was hit by storms, he blamed witches. His book Daemonologie incited Scottish witch-hunting and inspired Shakespeare to write Macbeth. The world he lived in was full of invisible magical forces. On view are relics of that universe, including a bezoar, to protect from poison, and the Charmstone of the Stewarts of Ardsheal.View image in fullscreenDouble portrait of Mary, Queen of Scots and James VI, 1580s, unknown artist.Photograph: Stephen Farthing/Blair Castle, Perthshire.If James was superstitious and hungry for love, his violent childhood may explain it. A wonderfully weird painting shows him as a child praying by the monument of his father, Lord Darnley, murdered in 1567 by the unusual method of blowing up the house where he was staying in Edinburgh. A print portrays the beheading of his mother in 1587.These are strange events from a time in history that is alien to us, yet the portraits here make us feel close to these people. James’s jester, Tom Derry, is utterly alive in a careworn, sensitive portrait by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger. As for the king himself, he goes through many changes. The virtual twin of Mary, Queen of Scots in a 1583 double portrait, even more “feminine” in a ruff-heavy painting a few years later, increasingly louche yet roughed up in later portraits. This terrific exhibition brings history to life without battering it into a 21st-century plaything.View image in fullscreenRavishing … Wael Shawky’s Cabaret Crusades III: The Secrets of Karbala, installation view, at Talbot Rice Gallery, 2025.Photograph: Sally JubbAn even more remote past is magically, jerkily performed by glass marionettes in Wael Shawky’s Cabaret Crusades III: The Secrets of Karbala. This ravishing film work at Talbot Rice Gallery is already an acknowledged classic of 21st-century art and comes to Edinburgh at a time when war again rages in the lands where, in the 11th and 12th centuries AD, Christians and Muslims fought for Jerusalem. You won’t find glib contemporary parallels in Egyptian artist Shawky’s screen epic. He does everything possible to estrange the Crusades, acted by puppets as if this were a slow, contemplative Thunderbirds.Cabaret Crusades takes you not just to another time but another way of telling it, in its own words. He refutes the historical nonsense of jihadis treating the Crusades as a living grievance just as much as he recovers an Arab view of a story often told through western sources. This is, in short, a phenomenally serious and complex achievement that is also hypnotically beautiful.View image in fullscreenDingy, derelict, claustrophobic … Mike Nelson’s installation at Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh.Photograph: Mike Nelson/303 Gallery/Galleria Franco Noero\\ Matt’s Gallery/neugerriemschneiderThe Middle Eastern past appears again as enigmatic, poetic ruins in Mike Nelson’s photographs of a ruinous Turkish city at Fruitmarket Gallery. They are hung at the bottom of the gallery walls, with bare lightbulbs and low benches, to encourage intimacy with how the artist imagines this lost world. Roland Barthes wrote of his fixation on a 19th-century photograph of the Alhambra: “I want to live there.”Nelson confesses something similar, then undercuts it with an installation in another part of the gallery representing a now-demolished housing estate: a reconstruction that becomes an impossible, ensnaring labyrinth. As you move through one dingy, derelict claustrophobic room and corridor after another, anxiety mounts. Where is this leading? The Edinburgh Dungeon next door has nothing on this. You can never go back to the past, says Nelson. If you did it would be a nightmare.View image in fullscreenHaunting … Aubrey Levinthal’s Couch (Three Boys), 2025.Photograph: Aubrey Levinthal/Ingleby, Edinburgh/Neighboring StatesIn general, art that is ambivalent and poetic has more to say than art that is simplistic and didactic. Unfortunately, there is some of the latter in Edinburgh, too. Siân Davey’s exhibition The Garden at the Stills Gallery takes the opposite of Shawky’s thoughtful approach. Davey and her son created a wildflower garden and invited their friends and neighbours to share this healing space. Good for them. But Davey’s big intensely coloured photos of her garden community, with herself and other people going nude in nature, are pure bathos. To make me believe this flowery paradise is a shelter and hope for the marginalised and oppressed, I would need more than mawkish oversharing. This is flower-power nonsense, half a century too late.Recovering from that, I turn to Aubrey Levinthal’s nuanced, elusive paintings at the Ingleby. The gallery is well worth seeking out, tucked down a side street in the classical New Town, and in Levinthal it has discovered a major contemporary painter. She depicts her quiet, middle-class family life in Philadelphia, but it is the way she paints it that’s wondrous.Planes of almost abstract colour turn out to be sofas or laptops. A vase of Hockneyesque flowers seems to emerge from a boy resting on a sofa; the man in her life, in a nice reversal of art’s old hierarchies, is portrayed as a classical bearded beauty, sprawled in a chair, her idealised, brainless muse.In the most haunting painting here, she studies her son, in a triple image, as he contemplates a glowing iPad screen. It’s a painting for our times.Until24 AugustExplore more on these topicsArtPhotographyPaintingEdinburghreviewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, Earth (Danielle Steers) is a Bridget Jones style singleton who is 750m years into looking for love. She is not convinced when Humanity (Tobias Turley) comes along, all earnestness and cute lines (“You are the centre of my universe”) but is slowly won over.Somehow, Jack Godfrey and Ellie Coote’s climate romcom manages not to make a hot mess out of a very bizarre idea. Quite the opposite. It is so well executed that you see the tragedy of Earth’s love affair with Humanity as a toxic relationship in which the latter betrays, manipulates and gaslights, even as you are dazzled by the music, tickled by the humour and taken in by the romance.It is a two-hander in which both performers blaze. Steers is armed with an out-of-this-world voice and a welter of well-timed one-liners (“I can literally pull anyone, it’s called gravity” and “I’m not picky, I’m naturally selective”). Turley is a formidable singer, too, and manages his character’s trajectory from wet-eared eagerness to workaholism, insecurity, unfaithfulness and denial.View image in fullscreenSurprises and delights … Steers and Turley in Hot Mess.Photograph: Mark SeniorIt serves as a metaphor for our abuse of the planet’s resources while making promises to do better, and be greener – tomorrow. But it is delivered without flat-footedness or strain, never breaking out of the storyline of its central romance. You know where it is all heading but it still manages to surprise and delight.Coote’s book whops out one brilliant line after another. Godfrey’s lyrics keep up while the music is super catchy, whether synth pop, rock, funk or moments of rap. The duo’s Edinburgh fringe show last year,42 Balloons, was a runaway hit. This cements their extraordinary musical chemistry. Coote, who directs as well, keeps it pacy.

They explain how queerness, neurodivergence and anti-colonialism guide what they doThu 7 Aug 2025 10.30 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShare‘It’s often dealing with quite elemental things,” says the vocalist Gwretsien Ferch Lisbeth of Tristwch y Fenywod’s music. “The sense of being in an ancient landscape; or the enchanted, sapphic feeling of being by the ocean. Our music addresses things that are simple and foundational, but very powerful.”Released last August – and now being performed live by the band across the summer festival circuit – the trio’s self-titled debut album is a lush, cathartic mix of gothic instrumentation and eldritch melody, like a lost Cocteau Twins masterpiece recorded in a cave in Eryri, stirring intense feelings even in those who can’t understand its Welsh lyrics. There’s a political dimension too. “The oppression of the Welsh language over the past 200 years was so aggressive,” says the drummer Leila Lygad, citing how Welsh children were forced to speak English in 19th- and 20th-century schools. “It feels important to champion languages that have been oppressed by colonial systems.”Formed in Leeds by members of the underground groups Guttersnipe, Hawthonn and the Courtneys, and using Welsh pseudonyms for the project, Tristwch y Fenywod tap into a particularly Welsh mysticism. Ferch Lisbeth was born in Bangor, and lived in NorthWalesuntil the age of 12. “I always found it to be a very mystical place,” she says. “The language was definitely part of that, although we were in the minority of not being a Welsh-speaking family.”Maybe no one’s ever written songs in Welsh from these perspectives, and it’s about time they existedGwretsien Ferch LisbethBefore living in Leeds, Lygad grew up on the nearby Staffordshire-Shropshire border, and spent her childhood “walking on Penmaenmawr mountain” – on the North Wales coast – “and visiting the first stone circle I’d ever been to”, which sparked “a lifetime interest in archaeology, history and Welsh culture”.Ferch Lisbeth’s family moved her to England aged 12, but the landscape and language of Wales stayed in her subconscious. In 2020, after discovering a friend on the Leeds experimental music scene was a fluent speaker, she dedicated herself to learning Welsh “obsessively, every minute of every day”. She’d also started to date the band’s third member, the Canadian bassist Sidni Sarffwraig, and the pair visited North Wales together. “Having this beautiful sapphic connection in those places felt profound,” says Ferch Lisbeth. “It was some logical arrival of fate for me; different threads of the psyche converging.”View image in fullscreen‘For neurodivergent people, experimental music is a space to unmask’ … left to right: Leila Lygad, Gwretsien Ferch Lisbeth and Sidni Sarffwraig.When Tristwch y Fenywod formed in 2022, Ferch Lisbeth was driven to sing in Welsh about queerness, mysticism and belonging, because “maybe no one’s ever written a song in Welsh from this perspective, and it’s about time it existed.” Their band name translates to “the sadness of women”, and they are inspired by the “stately, elegant, feminine sadness” of groups such as Dead Can Dance.They also embrace the experimental amateurism of the 1970s no wave scene. Lygad plays electronic drums, programmed with unconventional sounds from field recordings. Her snare is a recording of a snapping toy from a joke shop she exploded in an underground bunker, while her toms are the clicks made by echolocating bats, a particularly goth detail of her set-up. Sarffwraig plays a standard bass guitar, but Ferch Lisbeth plays a self-made instrument she calls adwydelyn– Welsh for “two-harp” – constructed from two zithers and a contact mic: “I was thinking about Celtic harp music, and the first Dead Can Dance record where Lisa Gerrard is playing theyangqin[a Chinese dulcimer].”The three of them talk admiringly about the adventurous atmosphere they’ve cultivated within the band, and that’s echoed in the Leeds scene that nurtured them. At the centre isWharf Chambers, an accessible, co-op-run venue where, according to Ferch Lisbeth, “honesty is rewarded and genuineness of expression is the goal”. This is especially crucial for a band who are all neurodivergent. “For neurodivergent people, experimental music is a space to unmask and be publicly witnessed experiencing intense emotions,” says Sarffwraig. “The scene around Wharf Chambers gave us space to do something weird in a language people don’t understand. DIY venues have to be protected because they’re so important for experimentation.”The band have found a similarly supportive second home in North Wales, in a community of alternative Welsh and Welsh-language musicians such asAnxiolytics,Sister WivesandCerys Hafanathat has “a very wholesome, casual inclusion of queer, trans and neurodivergent people”, according to Ferch Lisbeth. Established Welsh musicians have shown support, including Datblygu and the Super Furry Animals producer Gorwel Owen, members of Fflaps, and the singerGwenno, who has recorded albums in Welsh and Cornish. “Gwenno is a very important figure,” says Lygad. “She’s championing minority languages and is an outspoken anti-capitalist and anti-colonialist.”There’s a way of respecting the past and tradition without the politics of nationalist ideasSidni SarffwraigOutside of Wales, Tristwch y Fenywod have a kinship with groups such as Kneecap and Lankum, who share their anti-colonial approach to language and folk tradition. “It’s been lovely seeing Kneecap have success with the Irish language and take it to the mainstream, because that’s where it should be,” says Lygad.The band hope their music inspires people to learn Welsh, or other minority languages, for pleasure and resistance. “People talk about wanting large-scale systemic change, but they’re still using the [English] language of laws and power structures,” says Ferch Lisbeth, who sees every language as “a different system of perception”. They also model a radical connection with history and heritage. “There’s a way of respecting the past and tradition without the politics of nationalist ideas,” says Sarffwraig. “Welsh is ancient, and allows you to connect with the way people were living a really long time ago. It’s unfair that people with conservative politics get to have a monopoly on that culture and history. We’re resisting that.”Tristwch y Fenywod play Green Man festival in Bannau Brycheiniog, Wales on 14 August;Big City festival in Glasgow on 16 August;Ara Deg festival in Bethesda, Wales on 13 September;Le Guess Who? festival in Utrecht, the Netherlands on 8 November; andSt Matthias Church, London on 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsPop and rockExperimental musicWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can feel Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s disdain in every frameZach VasquezThu 7 Aug 2025 06.40 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 12.35 EDTShareTwo weeks ago, South Park kicked off its 27th season with one of its angriest, most politically daring episodes. The animated sitcom, long a magnet for controversy, incurred the wrath of the current US administration for its brutal and graphic send-up ofDonald Trumpas a petty, micro-penised dictator, as well as parent company Paramount’s cowardly capitulations to him.Lewd, crude and politically astute: South Park’s history of controversyRead moreCreators Matt Stone and Trey Parker received immediate backlash not only from online conservative fans (who make up a good portion of their audience) but the White House itself, which released a statement callingSouth Parkhypocritical and irrelevant. That latter charge was especially poignant, given that Stone and Parker just inked a new deal with Paramount for five more seasons, plus streaming rights, to the tune of $1.5bn.Tensions have only risen in the two weeks since the premiere aired. During that time, the show released several stills from the follow-up episode, which widens its sights from Trump to his media mouthpieces and foot soldiers. Figures from both groups –rightwing activist Charlie Kirkand the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – boastfully shared these images on X, with the latter sarcastically thanking South Park for helping them in their recruiting efforts. (The show responded on X by asking DHS “Wait, so we ARE relevant? #eatabagofdicks”.)All of this is to say that the new episode, titled Got a Nut, is coming in hot. And for the most part, it lives up to the hype.The episode follows two different stories: in one, the show’s resident bigot, Eric Cartman, is outraged to learn that fellow fourth grader Clyde has risen to prominence as a white nationalist podcaster who makes offensive claims about women, Jewish people, Black people and other minority groups to goad them into debating him in exploitative viral videos (“WOKE STUDENT TOTALLY PWNED”). Of course, Cartman isn’t angry on behalf of any of those groups; he’s mad that Clyde is ripping off his gimmick and reaping all the rewards. He decides to muscle in on the act, styling his hair after Kirk’s signature coif (“the stupidest haircut I’ve ever seen,” says one character), trolling college girls on social media and proclaiming himself a “master-debater”.The other storyline sees South Park Elementary’s kindly counsellor Mr Mackey out of a job thanks to government budget cuts. Desperate to find a new way to “make his nut”, he reluctantly joins Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Alongside his fellow masked goons – a collection of inexperienced, illiterate miscreants – and under the leadership ofDHS secretary Kristi Noem, Mackey ends up taking part in violent raids at Dora the Explorer concerts and the literal gates of heaven, where he helps round up every Hispanic in sight (per Noem: “Only detain the brown ones! If it’s brown, it goes down!”).Both stories eventually intersect, as Clyde and Mackey are rewarded for their work with a trip to Mar-a-Lago. The country club is depicted as a gross, white trash version of bizarre 70s/80s US wish fulfilment drama Fantasy Island, with President Trump and vice-president JD Vance standing in forRicardo Montalbanand dwarf actor Herve Villechaize’s characters. Younger viewers may not get this reference, but they don’t need to: the visual of an ice-cream-suited Trump kicking around a dwarf version of Vance (his already big face puffed up to resemble the popular meme of him) is hilarious all on its own.Trump gets off easy here compared with Vance, but the show saves its harshest vitriol for Noem, who spends all her time viciously gunning down cute puppies (including the beloved Krypto from the new Superman movie) and struggling to keep her overly Botoxed face from melting off her skull. It’s a ruthless scouring of Noem, and you can feel Stone and Parker’s disdain for her in every frame.View image in fullscreenMasked goons galore in South Park Got a Nut.Photograph: ParamountAs per South Park tradition, the central characters come to realise the errors of their ways, with Mr Mackey delivering the episode’s moral straight down the lens: “If you’re doing something you don’t really believe in just to make your nut, you’re gonna find that you just get sadder and your nut just gets bigger, m’kay?”Herein lies the issue with the episode. Got a Nut posits that the individuals who serve as Trump’s most gung-ho operatives are acting entirely cynically, doing and saying things they know are wrong for an easy pay cheque. Certainly, that’s part of it (see the signing bonuses and sponsorship deals the episode highlights), but it is dangerous to underestimate how many of these people fully believe their own rhetoric.But of course, it would be silly to expect a half-hour episode of South Park to encapsulate every facet of Trump’s dystopia. Luckily, we’ve got plenty of episodes left to look forward to (48, minimum). Just as exciting will be the surefire backlash coming from Trump and his base, who are utterly incapable of not taking the bait.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkTelevisionUS televisionAnimation on TVDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As soon as he began to play I grasped why. To say the great Puerto Rican New Yorker was a thrilling performer is an understatement: seated at the piano he threw himself into playing explosive Latin jazz, his rhythmic attack reminding me how his first job as a professional musician was playing timbales in his uncle’s band aged 13. This sense of joy, the excitement he found in making music, the chances he took, helped shape Eddie Palmieri’s long, brilliant career.To my mind, Palmieri was one of the truly revolutionary figures of postwar American music, up there with Muddy and Miles and Aretha and Dolly: a musician who reshaped a genre and extended the music’s possibilities. “El Maestro” is how his fans and fellow musicians referred to Eddie, and this human hurricane, built like a fire hydrant with the brightest smile and a mischievous twinkle in his eye, never disappointed.Born to Puerto Rican parents in Spanish Harlem and raised in the Bronx, Palmieri grew up absorbing the music of his fellow Latinos – from Mexico,Puerto Rico, Venezuela and, especially, Cuba – alongside the contemporary jazz and blues of his African American neighbours. Eddie started piano lessons aged eight – his brother Charlie Palmieri, nine years his senior, having already made his name playing Latin ballrooms while still in high school – and, by his early teens, was working alongside the likes of Tito Rodriguez while leading his own band. His love of Thelonious Monk and McCoy Tyner’s groundbreaking jazz piano ensured he studied harmony and determined to extend the possibilities of the Latin big band.Due to his enthusiasm for modern jazz, Eddie’s playing was often unconventional, employing unorthodox patterns and percussive effects, all the while drawing on the rhythmic richness of Latin music. His adventurous spirit ensured he influenced jazz, Latin and funk musicians while his generosity as a bandleader meant young musicians gravitated towards him, and the likes of Celia Cruz, Willie Cólon and Herbie Mann all appreciated his skills as a sideman.Palmieri made so much remarkable music across his long creative life its hard to know where to start when suggesting what to listen to. With his band La Perfecta he recorded 1965 solo album Azúcar pa’ Ti (Sugar for You), a pioneering Latin American recording that laid a blueprint for what would soon be recognised as the New York salsa sound. The eight-minute long Azúcar got heavy radio play on jazz radio stations that previously had kept to the three-minute format. Eddie, when asked how he achieved this, simply noted that the mob-affiliated Morris Levy owned the label: when Morris instructed DJs what to play they obeyed. The album also marks the first recording of Palmieri playing his trademarkmontuno(a repeated syncopated vamp) with one hand while soloing with the other.View image in fullscreenEddie Palmieri in 2011.Photograph: Seth Wenig/APIn 1970 Eddie formed Harlem River Drive with brother Charlie. Recruiting top Latino musicians, and Black funk/soul musicians such as Bernard Purdie and Cornell Dupree, HRD’s eponymous 1971 album served up a hugely influential Latin/funk fusion – War, the great Los Angeles funk band, borrowed heavily from Harlem River Drive while acid jazz DJs would introduce the album to UK clubs in the 90s.In 1974, album The Sun of Latin Music again demonstrated Eddie’s mastery of blending jazz improvisation with sophisticated Latin dance rhythms – it won Palmieri the first ever Grammy for best Latin recording. Here he employed modal stylings, feedback and tape loops, marking himself as way ahead of his contemporaries yet never losing his core Latino audience.Eddie had helped pioneer and popularise salsa but, once it became a popular dance genre, he moved on, always experimenting, never resting on laurels. He loved to collaborate and his albums with the likes of Cal Tjader, La India, Tito Puente and his brother Charlie are all masterful. His adventurous nature meant he was invited to play on 1997’s Nuyorican Soul album by Masters at Work – this album took New York’s Latin flavours into the house music genre and won Palmieri a new audience. Not that Eddie was about to settle into Latin house – he kept pushing his own musical envelope and 2017 albumSabiduría(“Wisdom”) is among his finest.I had hoped to see Palmieri play again one day, but least I have the memory of seeing El Maestro pound his piano with wild joy, this Nuyorican magus furiously blending jazz and Latin rhythms as he continued to quest across uncharted musical terrain.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockDance musicPuerto RicoNew YorkJazzcommentShareReuse this content"

For playwright Lyuba Ilnytska, it feels like an analogy for her native Ukraine under Russia’s unprovoked assault. Much as she would like a giant Pokémon bird to stand over Kharkiv, allowing its residents a peaceful night’s sleep, the reality is something more bleak. There is no escape from the terror.Working with choreographer Anatolii Sachivko from the city’sNafta theatre, performer and director Nina Khyzhna makes this theme concrete. As she presents it, the toll of life during wartime is not only psychological but also physical. Whether it is the bombardment of rockets and drones or the adjustment to prosthetics, air raid warnings and emergency Telegram groups, the impact hits the body.“Movement is a must for a human being” is a phrase repeated in a dance-theatre performance that articulates the unspeakable experience of living in sleepless fear.She dances, sometimes with small neurotic movements, a woman under pressure, other times with muscular fury, a victim fighting back, taking us through a theatrical poem that evokes the everyday oppression of war.View image in fullscreenA woman under pressure … Nina Khyzhna in Someone Like Me.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianBased on interviews with residents, old and young, Someone Like Me is a collage of voices, unrelated to each other but unified in the face of terror and speaking as one. A child on tiptoes plays a game of civilians and snipers; an old-timer recalls the great famine of the 1930s and previous military conflicts; a woman tries to reassure her mother they will be safe when she can scarcely persuade herself.Nik Akorn’s score clicks, rattles and unsettles, while Khyzhna moves with precision, mapping the streets of her beloved Kharkiv and embodying the trauma of her compatriots.

In Dead!!!, he rises again, after a stint as entertainment officer in the underworld, to reclaim his club from a scarier foe than the devil himself: gentrification.That’s the premise for a show that doubles down on, rather than develops, the formula that hit paydirt for the Huddersfield man last summer. And why not? Kent-Walters has devised something outrageously funny and bizarre here, a charismatic ghoul of an alter ego, terrorising his audience with a series of crap cabaret acts, delivered in a voice as deep and gravelly as a quarry in the bowels of hell. He appears in fewer guises this time, but his tatty ventriloquist’s doll, Mucky Little Pup, returns, and Kent-Walters swaps jackets to star as the usurper of Frankie’s club, Vegas Dave, too.More scally than yuppie, Dave – from loathed Lancashire – is nevertheless taking the Misty Moon upmarket (“schooner of creme fraiche for you, madam?”) Can our (anti)hero escape the clutches of Beelzebub and save the day? If that’s to happen, we must help: Kent-Walters embroils his audience in every set-piece here, whether that’s trading blows with Frankie’s “gammon hammer”, judging his gameshow Wine or Brine?, or singing along with his demented ditties (“I’m on me ’olidays”; “Egg in a bag”) – which in their gleefully aggressive idiocy summon, to comedy fans of my generation, Alexei Sayle’s blunt earworm’Ullo John! Gotta New Motor?It’s garish, ridiculous and chaotic in all the best ways, with our full-throttle host delivering one did-I-just-see-that? image after another – none wilder than the skit he performs with a mouthful of vegetables – and some choice gags, too, like the one imagining The Iron Lady as a Marvel movie. Happy to report after the success of Kent-Walters Live!!!, death very much becomes him.AtCabVol1 at Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Solitude Without Loneliness can feel like several fringe shows in one as Malcolm Sutherland’s dance-theatre production takes an early detour into sketch comedy and then continues to change gears.As a choreographer, Sutherland is interested in the perks and perils of isolation and he forms a trio with Jorja Follina and Alex Henderson, who are all initially alone together. Against the stark towers cast by Simon Gane’s lighting design, the three writhe in a state of undress, faces covered by their clothing. It’s a straightforward yet surprisingly effective way to establish a piece about depersonalisation, matched by muffled voices on Hörður Már Bjarnason’s rumbling soundscape and muted costumes by Alison Brown.As the dancers leave their silos to come together, their soul-searching gazes matched to choral music, you brace yourself for an overearnest hour. But then the Blind Date theme tune breaks out, rose petals are scattered and the trio alternate the roles of a frisky French waiter and two diners who can’t bear to look at each other as they squirm around their seats. The knockabout wordplay aims to be as nimble as the movement, but the touches of clowning – including red lipstick served and smeared in lieu of wine – are more winning.View image in fullscreenFrisky waiter … Malcolm Sutherland, centre, in Solitude Without Loneliness.Photograph: PRThe alternately serio-comic nature of these two episodes – which are both overextended – is akin to channel-hopping, and the contrast diminishes the impact of each. But the remainder of the show reaps haunting results from unlikely sources. The first is a series of speeches akin to Metro’sRush Hour Crushcolumn, each a message in a bottle to a stranger after a brief encounter.These missed chances for connection have a sting here, as does a meta-theatrical flyering sequence that finds the desperate cast surrounded by adverts for their own show. It’s a spin on the scenes along the Grassmarket outside, with Sutherland cannily pinning all his themes – romance, disorientation, loneliness, togetherness – to the fringe itself. An intriguing hour.AtDance Base, Edinburgh, until 10 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025DanceComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

For a very brief period, Dashiel assisted me, but it did not work out. Apparently, Dashiel has decided to respond to being let go by manufacturing claims against me in an attempt to attack and damage my reputation. I look forward to proving these allegations false, and am preparing a countersuit, which I am confident will expose this for what it is – an attempted shake-down by a disgruntled former assistant. Ultimately, I am certain the truth will prevail.”Gables started working for Rhymes in 2024 for $200 a day and during his tenure, claims that the star would degrade him, scream and spit at him and make unreasonable demands to himself and other employees, often making him work 18-hour days without overtime.In January 2025, Gables alleges that while in the lobby of the rapper’s residence, the pair were engaged in an argument. Gables’ daughter called and he ignored it, sending her a text message instead. Rhymes reportedly screamed at him and then punched him twice.Gables was hospitalised and filed a police report and Rhymes faced three assault charges. “While plaintiff tolerated a great deal of abuse while working for Busta Rhymes, he could not tolerate the repeated physical assault and was unable to return to work,” the lawsuit reads.He then claims as a result of the assault and the police report, he was “frozen out of the hip-hop music industry” and faces “substantial future lost wage damages” as a result.“I worked my heart out for Busta,” Gables said in a statement sent to the Guardian. “Long hours, day and night, weekends, you name it. He bullied me from day one. He regularly insulted me, called me names and slurs, screamed at me in front of other people … But I stuck around, because I needed the work and I thought things would get better. But instead, he punched me twice in the face.”In 2008, Rhymespleaded guiltyto charges of assault and drink-driving after he was accused of beating and kicking his former driver during a pay dispute while also attacking a fan at a festival.In 2015, he was alsoarrestedfor throwing a drink at a gym employee.Rhymes, whose hits include Gimme Some More and Break Ya Neck, recently made an appearance inThe Naked Gunreboot and was honoured with a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.Explore more on these topicsRapHip-hopnewsShareReuse this content"

Mears said Perry would“never work for the Opera House ever again”, the dancer later claimed.The signatories called for Mears “to be held accountable” and said the act “was itself a loud political statement” that “sent a clear message that any visible solidarity with Palestine would be met with hostility”.In his first response to the incident, Mears told staff in an internal email on Thursday that he had spent the last weeks reflecting on “what the ‘right thing to do’ was in those split seconds”. He said the answer was “still not obvious to me”.“I could not allow the precedent of a public and individual protest during a show, which is why I acted as I did. Bringing the curtain in, with an unrehearsed through-tabs curtain call, would likely not have ended well either,” he said. “Unfortunately, in the end I think there were simply no ‘good’ options: this was a messy and unhappy situation and not least because of that, I hope that I can have your understanding.”On Monday the RBO announced it hadpulled its 2026 productionrun of Tosca at the Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv. The announcement by the chief executive, Alex Beard, came after members criticised the RBO’s recent hiring out of its production of Turandot to the Israeli Opera and rejected any future performances in Israel.UK’s Royal Ballet and Opera withdraws Tosca production in Tel AvivRead moreThe members said the Israeli Opera publicly offered free tickets toIsraelDefense Forces soldiers “in recognition of their work” and the RBO should not allow its production and intellectual property to be presented in a space “that openly rewards and legitimises the very forces responsible for the daily killings of civilians in Gaza”.The RBO has said the decision to pull Tosca was taken due to concerns about the safety of company members in the region, and not because of the open letter. In an email to patrons on Thursday, Beard said: “I want to emphasise that this was not a political statement against Israel, but a pragmatic decision taken in challenging circumstances.”Several members of the RBO staff would have had to travel with Tosca to Israel because it was a first revival. Earlier this summer, rehearsals for Turandottook place in bomb sheltersdue to the Israel-Iran war.The Covent Garden-based Royal Opera House is the largest single recipient of funding from Arts Council England, receiving more than £22m annually. Last year, ACE faced a major backlash after it warned “political statements” could break funding agreements, shortly afterdiscussions with the governmentabout artists speaking out over the Israel-Gaza war.The RBO members’ open letter also cited the RBO’s swiftness to stand in solidarity with Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, including organising Concerts for Ukraine, playing the Ukrainian national anthem before performances, and publicly displaying the Ukrainian flag. “We understood then that silence was unacceptable. Why is it different now? … The double standard is deafening,” signatories said.Mears said on Thursday he understood people’s strong feelings about Gaza “because I share them. As I was disgusted by the atrocities on 7 October, I am sick to my stomach by the images and reports coming out of Gaza.”He added: “At the same time I believe that it is possible to hold political positions (which those who know me personally, know well) while also believing that a curtain call is not the time for a personal, impromptu political protest.”He said curtains calls were an opportunity for audiences to thank the artists and for artists to show gratitude for the appreciation shown towards their work.“A curtain call is not a window for [an] individual artist either to act as if on behalf of the whole company, or to alert an audience to their outrage at the actions of foreign governments. In a democratic country such as ours – one which affords us multiple routes for protest – any other approach will breed chaos,” he said.The RBO has maintained its support for Ukraine “was aligned with the global consensus at the time”.Explore more on these topicsRoyal Opera HouseLondonProtestRoyal BalletArts Council EnglandIsraelOperanewsShareReuse this content"

So I don’t know.”He added: “I feel like we’re at this cusp in human development where you’ve got the three existential threats: climate and our overall degradation of the natural world, nuclear weapons, and super-intelligence. They’re all sort of manifesting and peaking at the same time. Maybe the super-intelligence is the answer.”View image in fullscreenJames Cameron in 2023.Photograph: Javier Corbalan/APCameron’soriginal 1984 Terminator filmstarring Arnold Schwarzenegger is set in a world in which humanity is ruled by an artificially intelligent defence network called Skynet.Cameron’s films,Avatarin particular, are actively engaged with AI in their execution, and the director has been positive about how the technology could help reduce production costs. Last September, he joined the board of directors of Stability AI and earlier this year said the future of blockbuster film-making hinges on being able to “cut the cost of [VFX] in half”.He clarified that he hoped such cost-cutting would come not from human layoffs but speed acceleration.However, Cameron has also expressed scepticism about the capacity of AI to replace screenwriters. In 2023, he said: “I just don’t personally believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said – about the life that they’ve had, about love, about lying, about fear, about mortality – and just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate it … I don’t believe that’s ever going to have something that’s going to move an audience.

The crowd react orgiastically, and a nun “fondles the corpse’s visible erection”.Other signature Fennell shots include lingering takes of “suggestive textures” such as egg yolks, bread dough and slug trails.Test screenings offer production companies an early opportunity to gauge mainstream reactions to forthcoming releases. Studios show unfinished versions of films to the public, who usually promise confidentiality.The majority of final versions of movies differ from versions trialled in this way, with the endings of films a particularly common alteration. Films whose conclusions were changed following audience feedback include Titanic, 28 Days Later, Blade Runner, Pretty Woman and Sunset Boulevard.Earlier this year the film’s casting director, Kharmel Cochrane,defended her choicesafter many suggested Robbie was too old to play the role of Catherine Earnshaw, as well as questioning Elordi’s ethnicity, since Heathcliff, the foundling with whom she falls in love, is generally perceived to have a Romany or Gypsy background.Most big and small screen adaptations of the novel have ignored this, with the character having been played by actors including Ralph Fiennes, Tom Hardy and Timothy Dalton.Andrea Arnold’s 2011 adaptationcast a mixed race actor, James Howson, in the role.‘It’s just a book’: Wuthering Heights casting director defends choice of Margot Robbie and Jacob ElordiRead moreSpeaking at the Sands film festival in Scotland, Cochrane said there was “no need to be accurate” as the source material is “just a book”.She continued: “There’s definitely going to be some English Lit fans that are not going to be happy. Wait until you see the set design, because that is even more shocking. And there may or may not be a dog collar in it.”The film, which is scheduled for release on Valentine’s Day 2026, will be Robbie’s first major role since Barbie and Fennell’s first film since Saltburn became an audience sensation in 2023, although it underperformed with awards bodies.World of Reel quotes another attender of the Dallas screening as saying that despite strong leading performances, Fennell’s take on their characters is sufficiently “cold and unlikable” that engagement with their fates is made difficult.Explore more on these topicsFilmEmerald FennellEmily BrontënewsShareReuse this content"

That’s where Glen (series creator Ryan Sampson), Kirsty (Harriet Webb) and Lee (Danny Dyer) find themselves in the first episode of this double bill, followed by a revelatory season finale for the unlikely Bafta-winning sitcom.Ellen E JonesSaving Lives at Sea8pm, BBC TwoThe hard work of lifeboat crews continues to be celebrated in this series, as a 10-year-old boy is stranded at sea on his paddleboard in North Berwick, East Lothian. Elsewhere, off the east Kent coast, a yacht with three people on board has got stuck at Goodwin Sands, which is known as “the ship swallower”.Hollie RichardsonTom Kerridge Cooks Spain8.30pm, ITV1In Andalucía, the chef meets a “wine chemist” who explains the sherry vinegar process. Does Kerridge have the patience to make his own? Then, in Cádiz, the chef learns about the area’s burgeoning avocado business and gets to work in helping to grow them.HRView image in fullscreenTom Kerridge getting ready to make some vinegar.Photograph: ITVThe Gone9pm, BBC TwoThis New Zealand/Ireland-set crime drama moves slowly at times – Aileen and Derry’s wander through the woods in this episode may try your patience somewhat – but it’s still darkly intriguing. When search-and-rescue teams locate the pair, they think a breakthrough is near. But before long, they have another homicide on their hands.Phil HarrisonThe Secret Life of Trees9pm, Channel 5It’s the last episode of the Michael Palin-narrated nature series, and he’s poignantly exploring death and renewal. Not only can decaying trees start new life, astonishingly they can “walk” and plant new roots, too.HRFBI9pm, Sky WitnessHere’s a seventh season of a straight procedural co-created by Dick Wolf of Law & Order fame. That means pacy storytelling with minimal flair, though the stakes feel big in the new run’s opener, as a car bomb on a New York bridge sends the FBI on a trail that leads to an assassination plot with Iranian involvement – and a departure from the cast.Jack SealeExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightDanny DyerfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Irish actor Dervla Kirwan narrates this smart tale about a how a boy’s name influences his lifeFiona SturgesThu 7 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 10.02 EDTShareHow influential is a name? This is the question underpinning The Names, which opens with Cora taking her newborn son to register his birth. Her abusive husband Gordon wants his son to be named after him, though, secretly, Cora isn’t keen. She notes how the second syllable lands with “a downward thud like someone slamming down a sports bag”. She prefers Julian, which means “sky father”, though their nine-year-old daughter Maia would like her little brother to be called Bear, since it sounds “soft and cuddly … but also brave and strong”.Florence Knapp’s smart debut novel features a Sliding Doors-style plot in which the three names are tried out for size, each triggering a different reality. By defying her husband and choosing Bear, Cora is subjected to a beating that prompts a neighbour to intervene and call the police; when she names him Julian, young Maia steps in to defend her mother and break the tension. And when she registers him as Gordon, peace is maintained but not for long; when Cora asks for money to buy baby formula, her husband dispenses a different style of punishment. The repercussions of her decision are felt by their son, too, whose lives under the different names are traced across three decades.The narrator Dervla Kirwan deftly navigates the book’s parallel realities, drawing out the lyricism and vividness of Knapp’s prose. Although the narrative occasionally strains under the weight of its structure, it nonetheless reveals how it is not so much a name that influences a person’s life than the actions and character of those who raise them.Available via Phoenix, 9hr 41minFurther listeningWe All Live HereJojo Moyes, Penguin Audio,12hr 38minJenna Coleman narrates Moyes’s family drama revolving around single mother Lila, who lives with her two daughters, Celie and Violet, her elderly stepfather, Bill, plus the family dog, Truant.

But who was he really working for?John BanvilleThu 7 Aug 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 05.31 EDTShareSome years ago, a colleague on the Irish Times took the columnist Nuala O’Faolain to lunch. Nuala was famous, and feared, as a controversialist who specialised in attacking popular pieties, unless it was the pietests who were under attack, in which case she would spring immediately to their defence.The pair had hardly finished their starters when the colleague, who had been in newspapers long enough to know better, heard himself asking Nuala how she managed to have so many opinions, enough to fill 52 columns yearly, as well as the odd special assignment. Nuala, cutlery suspended in mid-air, looked at him incredulously and said: “What are you talking about? I haven’t any opinions – I’m a journalist.”Richard Evans, although a former newsman himself, does not seem to have grasped the first commandment in the journalist’s catechism: stop at nothing in pursuit of a story. His subject, George Ward Price, certainly adhered to it. Dubbed by Ernest Hemingway “the Monocled Prince of the Press”, he was one of the most successful and most famous journalists of his time. Born in 1886, the son of a clergyman, he lived for 75 years, and died largely forgotten but extremely rich, leaving more than £125,000 in his will, “at a time when”, Evans writes, “the average annual UK salary was around £1,000”.When Ward Price was at school, a friend said of him that his ambition was to be either “a bishop, or on the staff of the Daily Mail”. He hearkened to the latter calling, and quickly became the Mail’s star journo, producing scoop after scoop and leaving the competition stumbling in his wake. His greatest triumphs came in the 1930s, when he courted the Nazis zealously, in particular Hitler, who in Linz, on the evening after the German annexation of Austria, “greeted him with a smile. ‘Well, Ward Price,’ he said. ‘Always there!’”Ward Price’s reporting came in for serious criticism, including from Winston Churchill, who declared on meeting him: “I see that you’ve been over in Germany again, shaking the bloodstained hands of your Nazi friends.” In his autobiography, Extra-Special Correspondent, published in 1957, Ward Price claimed that he “reported his [Hitler’s] statements accurately, leaving British newspaper readers to form their own opinion of their worth”. For other commentators, he was merely the “international mouthpiece for the Duce and for the Führer”.In any case, early on in his book, Evans produces a piece of evidence that, taken at face value, unequivocally condemns the Mail’s preeminent reporter. Six months after the Anschluss, and following Neville Chamberlain’s peace mission to Germany, Ward Price spent some days at Hitler’s holiday retreat in the Bavarian Alps. Here he had exclusive access to the Nazi leader in all his moods, from the avuncular to the manic. At the end of his stay, as Evans writes, Ward Price “came down from the mountain with the biggest story in the world”.That story was of Hitler’s determination to take over the Czech Sudetenland, and by implication, his plans for further, wider conquests. However, the piece that appeared in the Mail seems to have been a tempered version of what Ward Price had written. And who did the tempering? Joseph Goebbels, who was at Berchtesgaden at the time, wrote in his diary: “He [Hitler] is still revising the interview by Ward Price, which has turned out very well. It was somewhat too effusive.”Evans makes surprisingly little of this explosive snippet, yet it is the smoking gun at the heart of his book. If Ward Price did allow Hitler to tone down what he had recorded, it would have been a total betrayal of himself as a journalist. Securing the “biggest story in the world” was possible only through an extraordinary act of malpractice. It is one thing to tell yourself you have no opinions, are merely an accurate chronicler – it is quite another to permit your subject to burnish his own image. When your subject is Hitler, it is wickedness itself.Interviewing Hitler: How George Ward Price Became the World’s Most Famous Journalist by Richard Evans is published by The History Press (£22).

Perhaps that earlier version had more to say about how the Clash came raging out of London’s punk scene in the 1970s; this one only really gets going in 1982 when Joe Strummer boots drummer Topper Headon out of the band for heroin addiction, then a year later kicks out guitarist Mick Jones. Rise and Fall Redux is a portrait of the band as a sinking ship, finally disbanding in 1986.It is a film groaning with talking heads. Pick of them is Viv Albertine of the Slits who sums the Clash up nicely when she says: “They were best when they were small and angry … when they were hard and angry and poor.” Others indulge in a bit intellectual waffle. The only member of the classic lineup to appear is guitarist Mick Jones, not taking it too seriously. Asked about the secret of the band’s success, he grins slyly: “It was a mix of luck and fortunate timing.” There are interviews too with the disgruntled drummers and guitarists hired in later years to replace Headon and Jones, poorly paid and seemingly badly treated by the band’s svengali-like manager Bernard Rhodes.In the end this a film for Clash fans, with little in the way of explainers; there’s not much, for example, about where the band came from or what it was like in the early days. There’s no recap of the stories about how Strummer met Jones and bassist Paul Simonon in a London dole queue, or how they were so frequently spat at on stage that in 1978 Joe Strummer contracted hepatitis from an audience member. It would benefit from a little more of the glory days, a little rise with the fall.The Rise and Fall of the Clash Redux is in UK cinemas from 8 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmMusic documentaryThe ClashDocumentary filmsPunkPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

In that process of recognition Grime’s smaller-scale works have received relatively little attention, but as this collection of seven recordings from the Hebrides Ensemble shows, the same qualities that characterise her largest orchestral canvases distinguish her work on the smallest scale too.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Helen Grime: Chamber Music.Photograph: DelphianThe pieces here, composed between 2004 and 2016, range from a string sextet to a work for two horns, and Grime’s fastidious ear to colour and texture is evident in all the instrumental combinations. Several of the pieces take their inspiration from nature and landscape, though the sextet, Into the Faded Air, borrows its title from TS Eliot’s Four Quartets;Ted Hughes’s poetry lies behind the trio Snow and Snow, while the starting point for the crisp, vivid Seven Pierrot Miniatures, composed for the same instrumental lineup as Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, is obvious enough. But as all the Hebrides’ performances demonstrate, this music can communicate even without any of its external references.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

The BPM soars and so do the feelingsGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailJared RichardsThu 7 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 7 Aug 2025 20.02 EDTShareIn case the title of Ninajirachi’s debut album didn’t make it clear, the Australian producer spells out her love for all things electronica on its turbo third track: “I wanna fuck my computer / Cuz no one in the world knows me better.”A glitched-out cacophony of bleeps, mechanical spirals and sirens, the track – titled, descriptively, Fuck My Computer – is a firework display of raw energy and excitement. That freneticism rarely lets up across I Love My Computer, an immensely fun and inventive dance album that doubles as a surprisingly touching coming-of-age story from one of Australia’s minted electronic exports.After first gaining prominence as a Triple J Unearthed High finalist in 2016 and 2017, Ninajirachi – real name Nina Wilson – established herself at the forefront of Australia’sthen burgeoning hyperpop community. But as the genre’s saccharine synths, irreverent samples and pitched-up vocals went increasingly mainstream post-2020, Wilson expanded her sound further. She released a cerebral 2022 mixtape, Second Nature, and played a series of slots at major US festivals including Lollapalooza and Las Vegas’s Electric Daisy Carnival.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningThe now 25-year-old producer has started identifying her genre as “girl EDM” – a tongue-in-cheek nod to the 2010s electronica she first fell in love with as a teenager online.Across the album’s dozen tracks, Ninajirachi pays tribute to that nascent period. Repeatedly, music reaches out in a language only she can hear: on Fuck My Computer, “it says my name”. And CSIRAC, a throbbing track named after the first computer to play music (an Australian invention, incidentally), feels like a deranged, borderline inscrutable trip into Wilson’s laptop.Across three minutes, the track jumps from chipmunk vocals to squelching acid-house breaks, metallic drones and pixelated breakbeats, as well as an eerie spoken-word bridge about following a sound. Which is exactly what the track is doing, racing through Wilson’s computer at breakneck speed and transcribing its bleeps and bloops.But you don’t need to overthink I Love My Computer to grasp the sincere depth of feeling Wilson has for her tech. In iPod Touch, another album highlight, Wilson links her music player to a flood of teenage memories. “It sounds like high school, front gate, smoke in my face / It sounds like iPod Touch / yellow Pikachu case,” she sings, her sugar-rush delivery thrashed against a frantic beat.Not to will another reboot into existence, but it’d make a great theme for a gen Z take on Puberty Blues. Here, images of archetypal Australian teenage rebellion (including wearing tiny Supré shorts) are just as nostalgic as memories of “me and my computer hanging out till late”, blasting a bass-boosted Porter Robinson song and trying out free music production software.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It sounds like the giddiness of adolescent discovery, where a song or artwork can cut through the confusion and awaken something so personal that you have no choice but to make it your entire personality.You might scoff at Wilson’s awakening through EDM – arguably the defining sound of the previous decade thanks to the likes of Calvin Harris, David Guetta and Diplo. But I Love My Computer proves how much juice the genre has, especially stripped of itsnoxious frat bro connotations. Wilson readily embraces steady builds, squelchy drops and a relentless BPM rarely below 120.I Love My Computer isn’t all euphoria, either. Delete is a twinkling ode to embarrassing Instagram stories, while Battery Death is a burnout lament built over dystopic error-synths. And on eurotrance track Infohazard, Wilson recalls stumbling upon a photo of a decapitated man on her computer as a teen. Led by a piano, it’s one of the few times a non-digital instrument is easily identifiable on the album – offering a strange sense of warmth to the confused, confronting memory.Indebted to electronic pioneer Sophie, Wilson has never been focused on real-life restrictions, more interested in what she can create than replicate. With her debut album, Ninajirachi charts a long-term (and fruitful) relationship with her computer. It’s very fun and surprisingly moving.I Love My Computer by Ninajirachi is out now via NLV RecordsExplore more on these topicsAustralian musicElectronic musicDance musicPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This was the 19thPromsappearance of the ensemble founded by Iván Fischer and the late Zoltán Kocsis in 1983, and like the finest of Hungarian reds they have matured splendidly.Chief among many virtues was the visible sense of camaraderie, that and the palpable joy they brought to the music-making, no matter how familiar the fare. These musicians must have played No 7 countless times, yet still it came up fresh as a daisy. There was the opulent string tone, bows digging deep as if the performers’ lives depended on it. Brass and woodwind players seemed born soloists, yet each visibly embraced the team spirit. And then there was Fischer, a model of elegance, coaxing and cajoling while teasing out those tiny details that lent the music spontaneity and vitality. In a truly memorable performance, the seamless flow and Fischer’s dynamic control of the Allegretto stood out, every instrumental line crystal clear (no mean feat given the Albert Hall’s soupy acoustic). Ditto the frisky scherzo, light and airy as a good souffle.The Bartók opera Duke Bluebeard’s Castle was an opportunity for the orchestra to demonstrate its impressionistic side, invoking a broad range of moods and musical imagery. Fischer paid close attention to orchestral colours, conjuring if not 50, then at least 12 shades of grey to convey the dank and gloom of Bluebeard’s sunless domain along with grinding dissonances and tense, eerie pianissimos. Woodwind and xylophone painted a lurid portrait of his grisly torture chamber, flickering brass fanfares illuminated the corners of a vicious armoury, while harp and celesta brought a hypnotic sparkle to the blood-stained treasury. The radiant flower garden and the overwhelming C major vistas behind the fifth door were vividly expressed.Dorottya Láng, a glowing, gutsy Judith, and Krisztián Cser, the most implacable of Bluebeards brought a crucial native intensity to the Hungarian text. Fischer’s expert hand on the tiller ensured the drama ground inescapably onwards to its chilling denouement.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

I suppose lists of this year’s “in” and “out” resorts help tourists decide where to go; no point going to Skegness for Michelin-starred food, or to Salcombe for a laugh and cheap beer. Less obvious coastal towns provide more nuanced fare. Perhaps the most alluring spots are those where we don’t forget the sea. These three towns are routinely ranked last resorts or else ignored altogether, but they offer more than stuff to eat, drink, buy and post on socials – and are close to swimmable beaches.Ayr, AyrshireView image in fullscreenA view of the Isle of Arran from Ayr.Photograph: Allan Wright/AlamyA century ago, Clyde steamers and the Glasgow and South Western Railway took thousands of sunseekers from inland towns to the Ayrshire coast. They came to escape the smoke and noise of industry, breathe in the briny air, and admire the Isle of Arran and tiny Ailsa Craig – from afar or up close on an excursion. The bed and breakfasts on elegant Park Circus (a sweeping crescent lined with cherry trees that blossom red on one side and white on the other) and the Georgian villas on Eglinton Terrace evoke something of the golden days of yore.It’s easy to imagine parasol-sporting ladies and tall-hatted gents strolling across the Low Green, a large field between the town centre and the beach. This open space – perfect for picnics, kite-flying and impromptu games – and the absence of any clutter on the prom make the seafront unusually peaceful. It’s as if Ayr has refused to become a traditional resort. No tat, no tack, not many tourists. There are places to play on swings and get an ice-cream or a pint, but lovers of amusement arcades and bucket-and-spade shops should probably stay away. On the short block beside the Low Green the buildings are mainly residential – including care homes, that standard fixture of coastal towns.Ayr is an ideal hideaway for those who want to do beach walks, read or write, and check into small, friendly guest housesThe beachis a golden sweep about two miles in length, with the old harbour at the north end. Wharves and quays once bustled all along the River Ayr. By the 14th century, this was Scotland’s principal west coast port. In the 18th century, more than 300 ships were moored every year, unloading American tobacco, French wine, Spanish salt, English earthenware and slate from Easdale in the Firth of Lorn. Walk south and you come to the ruins of Greenan Castle, a 16th-century clifftop tower. The sunsets over Arran are life-enhancing. I watched a woman of retirement age do her tai chi moves while keeping her eyes fixed on the island – spiritually separate from the dog-walkers and prom-striders.View image in fullscreenThe Tam o’ Shanter Inn is one of the pubs that claims to be Ayr’s oldest.Photograph: Andy Arthur/AlamyRobert Burns was born near Ayr and baptised in the Auld Kirk. In Tam o’ Shanter he writes: “Auld Ayr, wham ne’er a town surpasses, / For honest men and bonny lasses”. Alively pubon the high street, which is set back a good mile from the beach, is named after the poem; it claims to be the oldest in Ayr, but so does theBlack Bullon the opposite side of the river. Theold bridge(or Auld Brig, if you prefer, which inspired another Burns poem) that takes you across is pedestrianised and a beauty. All the old pubs are enticing but I had my most enjoyable, peaceful beer and dram in theTwa Dugs– also named for a Burns poem. In Ayr’s Waterstones, I found a long-overlooked 1969 Booker-nominated novel by Gordon M Williams,From Scenes Like These, that provided a brutally realistic riposte to Burns-esque takes on rural Scotland. I read it in the boozers, the caffs, on benches.People in Ayr will tell you the town has declined. They’ll tell you that in nine out of 10 seaside resorts. But this column gets me around, and I can vouch for the town’s general busyness and good looks. Sedate, somewhat stern, bereft of traditional fun stuff, it’s an ideal hideaway for those who want to do beach walks, read or write, and check into small, friendly guest houses.Things to see and do:Rozelle House Museum,Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, Culzean Castle and Country ParkBangor, GwyneddView image in fullscreenA quiet corner of Bangor.Photograph: Howard Litherland/AlamyBangor, the oldest city in Wales, came second from bottom in theWhich? 2025rankings and absolute bottom in 2024. Perhaps the latter partly anticipated the former. Casually saddle a place with derision and it takes a great effort to shake it off.As the gateway to the island of Ynys Môn (Anglesey), a university town and former royal capital, Bangor doesn’t need star ratings or hip amenities. The city’s origins stretch back to the founding of a monastery in the early sixth century. A cathedral was later built on the site. For centuries, Bangor was the spiritual and ecclesiastical hub for Gwynedd – a kingdom until the English came a-conquering – but remained a small settlement. Nonetheless, during the first flush of Welsh tourism, at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, pleasure steamers from Liverpool brought visitors to see the big church and the wild waters of the Menai Strait.This might be the best-connected seaside town in the UK with with Eryri national park, Caernarfon Castle and the Llŷn peninsula accessible by busThe boom years came after 1826 with the completion of the Holyhead Road, linking London with Dublin – hitched to the recently created UK by the 1800 Acts of Union. The first major civilian state-funded road building project in Britain since the Roman era, the job was given to Thomas Telford. The road (much of it on the same route as today’s A5) swept through central Bangor, making the former big village a major staging post, and creating the longest high street in Wales. To replace the ferry-shuttles, Telford’s magnificent Menai Suspension Bridge opened in 1826. Two decades later, Robert Stephenson built a tubular bridge to carry the Chester-Holyhead railway across the straits. With communications much improved, Bangor became a proper little port, with shipbuilding, sail making, iron founding, smithing and timber yards, as well as slate yards.View image in fullscreenThe magnificent Menai Suspension Bridge.Photograph: Slawek Staszczuk/AlamyWalk to the natural end of this high street – which turns residential – and you come to the shore, a pier and a large park between neo-NormanPenrhyn Castleand the sea. You don’t have an in-town beach, which might be why some of the raters have a low opinion of Bangor. But theWales Coast Pathand the railway line link Bangor with beaches at Llanfairfechan and Penmaenmawr, eight and 10 miles away respectively. In fact, this might be the best-connected seaside town in the UK, withEryri national park(Snowdonia), Unesco-listed Caernarfon Castle and Criccieth and theLlŷn peninsulaaccessible by bus, and of course Anglesey on the doorstep.Things to see and do:walk the Menai Suspension Bridge,kayaking off Caernarfon,Aber Falls DistilleryMillom, CumbriaView image in fullscreenMillom, Cumbria, with Black Combe behind.Photograph: Jon Sparks/AlamyThe Cumbrian coast is the most intriguing stretch of littoral in these islands. Backed by the towering, cloud-drawing fells of the national park, the shore is often beneath a blue dome. The towns along it are chapters in British social history. Whitehaven is like a Devon port town without the crowds. Workington is a fascinating ex-industrial town. Nethertown is a hidden hamlet in a spectacular setting.Millom, at the southern tip of the old county of Cumberland, is a stop on the coast-hugging railway line – a superlative train ride – betweenBarrow-in-Furness and Sellafield. Its main connection to the nexuses of nuclear war and power are the Millomites who commute south and north for work. Millom once had industry;hematite ore(iron oxide) was found at Hodbarrow in 1856 and mined till 1968, the population swelling to 10,000. Much of the land was transformed into anRSPB nature reserve, centred on the north-west’s largest coastal lagoon; little, common and sandwich terns breed on the islands and you can see ringed plovers, redshanks, great crested grebes and oystercatchers around the wetlands.The views from the summit of Black Combe are magnificent – with Blackpool Tower and Scafell Pike visible in clear weatherMillom is tiny, but has none of the jams and crowds of the villages in the nearby Lakes. The Camra-ratedBear on the Squarehas real ales, good food and live music. The town has its own fell – Black Combe – and while only a 600-metreMarilyn, its isolation and proximity to the sea make it feel higher. The views from the summit are magnificent – with Blackpool Tower and Scafell Pike visible in clear weather.The poetNorman Nicholson(1914-1987) was born in Millom and spent almost all his life here, shunning metropolitan literary circles and asserting that the much-maligned “provincial” has more in common with people of other times and lands and consequently “may be all the more aware of that which is enduring in life and society”. The titles ofhis booksreflect the locale:Rock Face(1948);The Shadow of Black Combe(1978);Sea to the West(1981). St George’s church has a stained-glass windowdesigned by Christine Boycethat was inspired by Nicholson’s writing. His house is being restored, while Millom as a whole is undergoing amajor rebuildwith heritage and health projects afoot as well as a 7.5-mile walking and cycling trail.For a swim, head toSilecroftby train (one stop) or on foot (3.5 miles);Haverigg beach, though closer, often has pollution warnings.Things to see and do:Millom Heritage and Arts Centre,Swinside Stone CircleFurther information:Visit Scotland,Visit CumbriaandVisit WalesExplore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysWhere tourists seldom treadSummer holidaysFamily holidaysCultural tripsDay tripsShort breaksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The accident had nothing to do with the 3.1kg book, which was already safely on the back seat of the car by the time I didn’t notice the kerb or the cyclist. Years on, and the scene repeats on me whenever I see the cream cover of not just the heaviest, but maybe the most handsome cookbook on my shelves. Written by the journalist Giuseppe Coria and first published by Vito Cavallotto Editore in 1981, Profumi di Sicilia is an encyclopaedic exploration of Sicilian regional cooking – the smells, ingredients, recipes, folklore, trivia, traditions and origins. A significant part of the book’s great beauty is the photographs of ingredients, dishes and scenes by Melo Minnella, which saturate the pages with colour and which appear in pairs every eight pages of text.Broken into many familiar chapters and subchapters, with small line drawings – a snail, bowl, potato or flask – the hundreds of recipes are in paragraph form, with many containing no quantities at all – just a description of how to put ingredients together to make X. Others, meanwhile, have specific quantities included in the descriptive paragraph, but always with plenty of leeway; Giuseppe’s ability to judge when a reader/cook needs general advice and when they need specific quantities is not just impressive, but inspiring.The great number of recipes for each ingredient, which run into each other in narrative style, also makes the book a good, practical source of inspiration when you have an ingredient you are not quite sure what to do with, and hope the solution involves things you already have in the house. Last week, that was aubergines, which are now available all year, I know, but which are at their best from July to September (and also plentiful and, therefore, good value). Giuseppe has 25 aubergine recipes, and my favourites include braised in olive oil with potatoes and mint, as part of a caponata with capers and pine nuts, and “inagrodolce”. This week’s recipe is a mix of all three.Giuseppe suggests honey as thedolce(sweet) element, alongside red-wine vinegar to provide theagro(or the sour/acidic balance). Warmingthe two in a frying pan is ideal, because there is then plenty of space to roll the roast aubergine wedges in the dressing before adding the capers, pine nuts and mint, which is a natural and feisty partner for the velvet texture of the veg.Much likecaponataandscapece, this is best left to sit for at least an hour before eating, turning the aubergine wedges a few times so they sop up the dressing. Sweet-and-sour aubergines with capers, pine nuts and mint goes spectacularly well with lamb chops (mint sauce lovers will appreciate this), as well as with roast chicken or hard-boiled eggs. Alternatively, serve it alongside other room temperature dishes such as tabbouleh, chickpea and roast red pepper, or a tomato salad.Sweet-and-sour aubergines with capers, pine nuts and mintServes42 large or 4 slender auberginesOlive oilSalt2 tbsp red-wine vinegar2 tbsphoney, or sugar2 tbsp small capers1 tsppine nuts, or chopped almonds1 handfulfresh mint leaves,left whole is small, ripped if largePull the stalks off the aubergines, then cut them into long pieces (quarters or eighths, depending on the size of the aubergines). Rub with the olive oil and some salt (hands are the best tool for this), then arrange on a tray and bake 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 25 minutes, turning two or three times, until golden, soft and wrinkled.Meanwhile, warm the vinegar and honey in a frying pan, tasting to make sure that it is both sweet and sour to your liking. Add six tablespoons of olive oil and taste again. Add the roast aubergine in batches, turning until they glisten, then lift on to a serving plate, leaving most of the sauce in the pan.Add the capers, nuts and mint to the sweet-and-sour sauce, heat for a minute, then pour over the aubergines. Leave to sit for at least 30 minutes, turning occasionally, before serving.Explore more on these topicsVegetablesA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkSide dishesStarterVegetarian food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
