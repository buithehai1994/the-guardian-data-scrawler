Then she grew up and began researching child sex trafficking, slowly piecing together clues about her own lifeMon 18 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 09.42 EDTShareKate Price is now an academic, but it was at six that she conducted her first piece of research, leaning into the cab of her father’s truck and pressing the side button of his CB radio, the black plastic hot from the sun. She spoke the name she’d heard into it, “Chicken Plucker”, and a man’s voice replied. It was her first proof that the name she’d somehow associated with being taken from her bed in the middle of the night was attached to a real person, and that perhaps he would have answers. Then her father caught her and she was too terrified to try to contact him again.Five decades on, Price has written This Happened To Me, a memoir that reads, in part, like a detective story, piecing together clues to create a picture of the horror that had been done to her as a child, as well as her path to healing. When we speak over Zoom, Price is in her office at Wellesley College, the women’s college in Massachusetts, where she researches commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) – a world away from the rural Pennsylvania town where she grew up. For as long as she can remember, Price was sexually abused by her father until she was about 12, and he left the family. What she didn’t discover until she was an adult was that he had also been drugging her and, in the middle of the night, “selling” her to men.The book, she says, “really poured out of me”. If it was difficult to write about an almost unimaginable crime, she points out this is what she does as a career. “I research child sex trafficking. I haven’t been trafficked in about 40 years – not to say that I’m healed completely, but this is a subject matter [I work on] all of the time.”Price is also used to talking about her own experience as part of her work, and has had decades of therapy, including taking part in the pioneering trauma treatment by thepsychiatrist Bessel van der Kolkin the early 90s; Kolk included Price as a case study inhis bestselling book The Body Keeps the Score. He was the one who first told her that her PTSD would be a lifelong condition to manage, and she does, with therapy, exercise, sleep and nutrition, as well as a steady, loving marriage. “I’m lucky to have the resources,” she says. “It’s a ton of privilege that goes into it.”Much of Price’s book is based on the decade-long investigation she worked on with the journalist Janelle Nanos, which became a 2022 piece for the Boston Globe. “In the same way that I was able to thrive in school, I could compartmentalise, thinking this is a research project. Yes, it’s my life, but …” She doesn’t finish the thought. “I would say, actually, it was incredibly healing. My sister and I had these incredible conversations that we’d never had, that started when I was working on the article, but continued as I was working on the book. That was happy emotion, quite the opposite of this gut-wrenching stuff.”Growing up, Price witnessed the violence of their father against her older sister. Her sister, who was constantly compared unfavourably to Price, appeared to hate her. In the course of her research, Price would find out her sister had also been trafficked by their father. Price also endured their father’s physical violence; she remembers being four and hiding in cupboards when he came home from his job as an electrician, wishing it would open into Narnia, before being beaten by him. When she was six, in a rage, he carved an X on her arm with his penknife, telling her she belonged to him, then threw her down the stairs into the basement.“I knew something was wrong,” she says, but adds that she had no understanding or other frame of reference to know this was not normal. But her world started to open up: at the birthday party of a friend from her swimming team, Price discovered a home filled with books and art, where the family seemed to like one another and the children were treated with respect. “To even know that a family could be happy,” she marvels. Price vowed that one day she would create that life for herself, and she was smart enough to know that, for her, it would come through education.The abuse continued until Price was 12 and their father left the family for a young woman he had started an affair with. As a teenager, Price took an overdose of pills (antibiotics, it turned out, so they didn’t harm her). She was desperately unhappy, unsure why she couldn’t form close relationships or make good choices in boyfriends (one was emotionally and sexually abusive). As an older teen, driving past an adult cinema and rest area by the interstate, Price would tense up but not know why. “I was just so focused on going to college, on getting out of there. Even as I had these responses, it was like, push it away, I’ll deal with that later. Our brains are hardwired for survival and that was very much me.”Price did get away, collecting degrees (she would get a doctorate for her research on the criminalisation of child sex trafficking victims) while supporting herself with admin jobs and working in bookshops. She was living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and working as an assistant to the dean at Radcliffe, the Harvard women’s college, when she started seeing a therapist. Her mother had recently died, and she was grieving, but she was also unhappy and lonely, unable to make friends and living in an intellectual city that seemed alien to her rural childhood. She was also aware that her trauma went deeper. The therapist, worried she wasn’t making much progress, referred Price to Van der Kolk.During one of their sessions, Price told him her father had sexually abused her, the first time she had told anyone. What was it like to finally tell someone? “Honestly, for me it was such a relief to have an older man in my life who I trusted. I had never had that before.” This, along with being more settled at work and studying, and her father now living hundreds of miles away in Florida, meant she felt more secure than ever. “I was creating my own life, then it was like [my brain said], OK, you’re safe, you’re ready to feel the full brunt of all of this.”View image in fullscreenKate Price and her cat at the back door of her home, 1976.Photograph: Courtesy of Kate PriceThe night that she experienced her first full flashbacks of being raped by men other than her father, at a rest area by the interstate, she had to go to hospital, suicidal. “This is information I had been trying to unlock, at that point, for a couple of years,” she says. “It was like seeing a slideshow, and it was about 100 perpetrators, and I can close my eyes right now and still see it, and it was absolutely overwhelming and terrifying.” She saw Van der Kolk the next day, and would do for many years. It was also the start of “learning how to be a human being”. She couldn’t feel emotions, and remembers buying cassette tapes teaching her to tap into them. “I was numb. I had been completely dehumanised by my father. He had beaten out any sense of agency or humanity in me.”One of the hardest things, she says, “that was so difficult to square, was just how purposeful it was”. That her father had drugged her, and allowed men to rape her for money. Emboldened, she called him – not quite brave enough to tell him she’d remembered she had been trafficked, but she did confront him about the sexual abuse. He exploded, and told her never to contact him again. “I was understanding the totality of everything that had happened to me, and I was finally more angry at him than I was scared,” she says. “By this time, I had been doing work for three, four years, and I just couldn’t live the lie any more.”View image in fullscreenBessel van der Kolk, the psychiatrist and PTSD specialist who helped Price to deal with her traumatic childhood.Photograph: M. Scott Brauer/The GuardianUp until that point, she still had contact with her father – there were occasional phone calls, and once she even stayed with him for several days. Although she didn’t know the full extent of his abuse, she knew he had repeatedly raped her as a child. How could she be around him? “That is Appalachia, it’s always family first. That had been ingrained in me, and I just went along with being a good girl.” She had seen it with her own mother who had been treated horribly by her family, but remained dutiful (she would also find out her mother had been sexually abused by her own father). Price, when around her father, was still in “survival mode” she says. “How to appease him, how to take the temperature of his moods.” Until the full realisation became too much. “I was sick of the falsity, and I was sick of being his puppet. I realised that I was colluding at that point – by going along with his game, that I was part of his narrative. He got to say he had talked to me or seen me, like we had this great loving relationship. Forget that, I’m done.”Price never spoke to her father again, but Nanos, the Boston Globe journalist did, in 2022 (again, he angrily denied everything). By the time Price met Nanos, and they began working together on the story, she was an influential researcher of commercial child sexual exploitation – what we used to call, appallingly, “child prostitution”, and was happily married to a renowned sports journalist, with a son.During the long years of researching that story, other family members and people who knew the family disputed Price’s experiences. “I wasn’t surprised,” she says. “I did not do the article or write this book to repair any family or former friend relationships. I feel compassion for my family, because if they were to actually acknowledge that my father had abused and trafficked me, they would have to reconcile that they’d been duped their entire lives by him. And they would also have to confront that maybe they themselves, or their children, had been sexually abused, either by my father or someone else.” She knew what had happened, but she wanted to know who else knew.Price’s second grade school photograph, 1977.Photograph: Courtesy of Kate PriceDevastatingly, Price discovered her mother had known. They had been close, and Price loved her mother. She doesn’t have answers, but the way she talks now, rationalising her mother’s decision to stay, is calm. Talking to her mother’s best friend, who revealed the truth, Price thinks her mother was terrified of losing them – either taken away as children, or through estrangement as young adults had she confessed. “As a mother, it is certainly not the choice I would make, and at the same time, I say that as a middle-class woman who has choices. My mother was an uneducated woman and trapped in an abusive relationship. So we sit at very different places.” Is she not angry with her? “Of course. She threw us to the wolves. As a non-offending family member, she was part of the collusion.”If she has reached a degree of forgiveness, or at least understanding, for her mother, extending the same to her father has not been necessary for her ongoing recovery. She found out he’d died a few months ago, and wasn’t sad. “I’m just grateful that he’s not here any longer so he can’t hurt anyone else.”Price never attempted to bring her father to justice. “When we look at the statistics, and this is not for trafficking, but child sexual abuse in the United States, less than 10% of reported perpetrators are convicted. We don’t have a culture that serves and supports survivors and victims. I knew what a defence attorney would do to me, completely rip me apart.” We need, she says, to “believe and support survivors, because that blaming and shaming of victims and survivors is empowering perpetrators to keep going”.Since the article, and now with the book, other survivors contact Price. It isn’t difficult, she’s grateful, she says. “I’m honoured that people want to share their stories with me and that people feel some sense of validation, being seen. As we know, so many survivors take their own lives.” She points to Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked and abused by Jeffrey Epstein, anddied by suicide in April. “She was one of the most strong, outspoken survivors I’d ever seen. But then to take her own life, it sadly is a story I know all too well. So I’m grateful that I can be here, to provide research that validates other people’s experience, particularly for familial survivors who have been told by their families, like me, that they’re crazy, that they’re making this up. To be able to say, actually, here’s somebody who got the proof. This really does happen.”This Happened to Me by Kate Price (Bonnier Books, £22).

Then he has a stunningly frank encounter with a woman who has hated him for three decadesJack SealeMon 18 Aug 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 17.35 EDTShareEarly on in Confessions of a Brain Surgeon, a crew member pipes up from behind the camera. Would Henry Marsh mind saying something, anything, to see if the microphones are working? “When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,” Marsh says instantly, not pausing for a moment to gather the words, “I all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, and look upon myself and curse my fate.” A simple “testing testing, one two” would be standard practice, but Marsh is not your standard documentary subject.Marsh is a retired neurosurgeon, having spent decades at the top of his profession. You’ve probably seen hospital documentaries that have featured an “awake craniotomy”, the macabre procedure that keeps a patient with a sawn-open skull conscious, so the effect of the scalpel’s cuts can be monitored in real time. Marsh, along with his longterm colleague, anaesthetist Judith Dinsmore, pioneered that. He performed numerous other exceptionally advanced operations with unique skill. Countless patients who were told by less able, less imaginative medics that they were terminally ill were treated successfully by Marsh.At 75, Marsh is physically and mentally agile, but his own diagnosis of prostate cancer has caused him to reflect. In Charlie Russell and Harriet Bird’s exquisite film, he reviews diaries and home movie footage, and meets important people from his past.So how does this man, the one with Shakespeare sonnets ready on his tongue, feel to have been the best at the vocation we use as shorthand for the world’s hardest job? “All surgeons carry inside themselves an inner cemetery,” he says. “A place full of bitterness and regret.” Every professional lifesaver is haunted by the people they were unable to help, but Marsh is so troubled by the relatively few patients who died on his table that he can’t take pleasure in his many successes. He struggles even to remember them.Confessions of a Brain Surgeon is his quest to rectify that, and make peace with himself. The result, powered by Marsh’s pitiless acuity and disarming eccentricity, is a deep meditation on what it means to have lived: death hands us a ledger of triumphs and mistakes, the happiness we’ve spread tallied against the pain we’ve inflicted. Was it all worth it?Marsh remembers a 16-year-old girl who had a life-altering stroke after her operation. He remembers patients who did not survive at all. Reviewing his trips to Ukraine, which he has visited regularly as a volunteer since 1992, he finds footage of Tania, a girl he brought back to London but could not cure. “I look at this with complete horror,” he says, peering through the thick, round spectacles that enhance his hawkish gaze. “Horror” is the word he uses most often.With the help of his first wife, Hilary, Marsh also looks back at the negative effect his calling had on his personal life. Was he a workaholic who sacrificed his family’s happiness to drive himself forward? Yes, but as with seemingly everything in Marsh’s life, matters had a cruelly precise balance and inevitability to them. He chose to train as a neurosurgeon after his first child, William, became seriously ill at the age of three months. The baby recovered after a successful brain operation but the ordeal was, Marsh says, “horror beyond horror”.An already piercingly emotional documentary shifts up a gear during Marsh’s meeting with a woman named Tina. Almost thirty years ago, Tina’s four-year-old son Max had a brain tumour, and Marsh said he could fix it. He was wrong. In a stunningly frank exchange, Tina admits that she has carried a hatred for Marsh ever since Max died; Marsh admits that he misdiagnosed the type of tumour Max had “because I was arrogant”. But then Tina lets go and forgives, for the simple reason that Marsh has full recall of the case: he remembered her little Max. Suddenly this brusque scientist leans across the table and grasps both Tina’s trembling hands. “Of course I remembered.”Further redemption comes from reunions with Dinsmore, the anaesthetist, who reminds Marsh of the great work they did; and his long-serving secretary Gail, who says it was an honour to assist him. Then there is an old patient, Jude, who was a new mum in 2002 when she was told by doctors that her tumour was inoperable. Marsh disagreed; Jude recently saw her son graduate. In her house, Marsh is shown a wall of family photos, each memory a gift bestowed by the dedication that has brought him unimaginable anguish. Was it all worth it? The film ends with Marsh still weighing the evidence, but we’re given reason to hope that his answer will be yes.Confessions of a Brain Surgeon aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNeuroscienceHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

Does its author think the technology could write a better novel than a human?Mon 18 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 10.04 EDTShare“Idon’t feel particularly unhappy about my work being used to train AI,” says Japanese novelist Rie Qudan. “Even if it is copied, I feel confident there’s a part of me that will remain, which nobody can copy.”The 34-year old author is talking to me via Zoom from her home near Tokyo, ahead of the publication of the English-language translation of her fourth novel, Sympathy Tower Tokyo.The book attracted controversy in Japan when it won a prestigious prize, despite being partly written by ChatGPT.The author speaks conversational English, but her translator, Jesse Kirkwood, is also on the line, interpreting questions and answers when needed. At the heart of Sympathy Tower Tokyo is a Japanese architect, Sara Machina, who has been commissioned to build a new tower to house convicted criminals. It will be a representation of what one character – not without irony – calls “the extraordinary broadmindedness of the Japanese people”, in that the tower will house offenders in compassionate comfort.In the novel, Sara, herself a victim of violent crime, wonders if this sympathetic approach to criminals is appropriate. Does this sympathy reflect Japanese society in reality?“It’s definitely prevalent,” says Qudan. One of the triggers for writing the novel, she adds, was theassassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abein July 2022. “The person who shot him became the centre of a lot of attention in Japan – and his background elicited a lot of sympathy from people. He had grown up in a heavily religious household, and been deprived of freedom. That idea had been in my head for a long time, and when I came to write the novel, it came out again as part of the process.”The question of public attitudes towards criminals runs through the story, in serious and satirical ways. Potential residents of the tower must take a “Sympathy Test” to determine if they are deserving of compassion (“Have your parents ever acted violently towards you? – Yes / No / Don’t know”) … and the ultimate decision will be made by AI.Changes of language over the last few decades are affecting how people act or view thingsSympathy Tower Tokyo won the Akutagawa prize in 2024 for new or rising authors when it was first published. She was “delighted”, she says, but also “liberated, because once you make your debut as a writer, there’s a constant pressure to win this prize”. In 2022, she had been nominated for her book Schoolgirl, but didn’t win. “I felt I’d let people down by not winning the prize, and that was something I didn’t want to repeat. You know, with that prize it stays with you your whole life.”But the book also grabbed attention because Qudan said that part of it – 5% was the figure given, though she now says that was only an approximation – was written using artificial intelligence. This, she tells me, comprised parts of the novel which are presented as a character’s exchange with ChatGPT. But Qudan also “gained a lot of inspiration” for the novel through “exchanges with AI and from the realisation that it can reflect human thought processes in interesting ways”. Qudan’s use of AI, in other words, seeks not to deceive the reader but to help us to see its effects.One character feels pity for the chatbot, “condemned to an empty life of endlessly spewing out the language it was told to spew, without ever understanding what this cut-and-paste patchwork of other people’s words meant”.Does Qudan fear that AI will supplant human writers? “Maybe a future will come when that happens, but right now there’s no way an AI can write a novel that’s better than a human author.” Among Japanese readers, Sympathy Tower Tokyo “did get attention for using AI. But more than that, it was a focus on the language itself which really generated discussion; how the changes of language over the last few decades are affecting how people act or view things.”And this feeds into the key issue at the heart of Qudan’s book. Sympathy Tower Tokyo is really all about language, which in the book is not just how we express ourselves, but how we reveal ourselves. “Words determine our reality,” says one character.By using katakana, a lot of negative associations can be replaced by neutral one. It doesn’t trigger people in the same wayIn the novel, a key debate is around the growth of katakana in Japan – that is, the script used to write foreign-derived words. Words rendered in katakana (as opposed to hiragana script and kanji characters, which are used to write traditional Japanese words) resemble transliterations of English – “negurekuto” for neglect, “fōrin wākāzu” for foreign workers – and to Japanese ears they are “milder, more euphemistic” than traditional kanji words, and can avoid “discriminatory turns of phrase”. The character Sara thinks “Japanese people are trying to abandon their own language”. Her boyfriend wants to “stop this wretched proliferation of katakana”.But stopping it is not easy, and probably not possible. Qudan explains that while older generations sometimes choose katakana over kanji, or vice versa, for younger generations like her – Qudan was born in 1990 – katakana “has become a standard which is not questioned”.This is not merely an academic or cultural detail, but an urgent issue for Japan’s politics today. In Japanese elections last month, the far-right party Sanseitosurged in support, winning 14 seats in the upper house of parliament, where it had previously held only one. The party campaigns on a slogan that translates as “Japanese people first”, echoing Donald Trump and Maga’s “America first”. Its success has raised fears of an anti-foreigner backlash. Is diversity valued in Japan?“Unfortunately,” Qudan says, “the reality is that not all Japanese people welcome diversity. Twelve years ago, I had a foreign, non-Japanese boyfriend, and I introduced him to my parents. My mother was extremely unhappy. She panicked. It might have been the biggest shock in my entire life to see my own mother react in this way. I’d never thought of her as someone who discriminated against foreigners.‘Marriage feels like a hostage situation, and motherhood a curse’: Japanese author Sayaka MurataRead more“There are people all around you who you would never think hold those views, who actually do hold those views. A lot of Japanese people, on the surface, they know how to act in a way that makes them seem [welcoming of diversity]. And this discrepancy between what people think on the inside and what they say is a very distinctive feature.”This brings us back to language, and how it can both conceal and reveal. In its “Japanese people first” slogan, Qudan explains, the Sanseito party uses the katakana word for “first”, rather than the traditional Japanese kanji word. “By using the katakana equivalent,” Qudan says, “a lot of the negative associations can be replaced by neutral ones. It doesn’t trigger people in the same way.”It creates, in other words, a sort of plausible deniability? “Yes, yes. They know exactly what they’re doing. And that’s why this use of katakana requires our attention,” Qudan concludes. “When someone uses katakana, we should ask: what are they trying to hide?”Sympathy Tower Tokyo by Rie Qudan is published on 21 August (Penguin Books, £10.99).

In doing so, Trump and his top allies are acting in an authoritarian style by revising history, rejecting facts and widely accepted science, critics add.“The irony in firing the widely respected economist and BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer is that the commissioner has very little to do with the actual production of the figures Trump says were ‘rigged’,” said Peter Shane, who teaches constitutional law at New York University.“‘Rigged’, in Trump-speak, just means ‘unfavorable to Trump’. To the extent the firing had an actual purpose, it was not to reform [the] BLS, but to send a message to all agency heads that the release of unflattering information, no matter how routine or how objective, would put their jobs in jeopardy,” Shane added.Little wonder that Trump on 11 August announced he was nominating EJ Antoni, an economist at the rightwing Heritage Foundation who has been a vocal critic of the BLS, to replace her, and boasted that he “will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST AND ACCURATE”.Scholars, ex-justice department officials and even some conservatives say Trump’s and his loyalists attacks on truth have increased in his second term in dangerous ways, since he has avoided choosing the kinds of aides who before served as guardrails against some of his instincts to revise history and promote radical policies.“The difference between Trump 1 and Trump 2 is that he now has no guardrails … Now Trump is surrounded by people who want to be like him. He learned his lesson of not having people around him who would say no to him,” said George Conway, a lawyer and board president of the Society for the Rule of Law, a group that includes several ex-justice department officials with Republican pedigrees who have been critical of Trump’s authoritarian-style moves.Conway added: “He’s always tried to create his own set of facts. None of this is new. It’s part of Trump’s conspiratorial mindset.”Shane stressed: “Sabotaging independent sources of knowledge, flooding communications media with disinformation, and rewriting history’s narrative to conform to ideology rather than fact are hallmarks of authoritarianism.”Shane’s points are underscored by multiple Trump and administration actions, including Trump’s counter-factual charges that crime in Washington was “out of control” despite data released early this year that showed violent crime in DC was at a 30-year low.Still, flanked by several cabinet members, Trump held a press conference to declare a “public safety emergency” and put DC police under temporary federal control, while deploying 800 national guard troops to America’s capital.Elsewhere, Trump loyalists at the EPA moved this month to rescind its key 2009 endangerment finding, which has underpinned regulatory efforts to fight climate change since the Barack Obama administration as the agency increasingly rejects widely accepted scientific facts.Likewise, the justice department impaneled a grand jury in August to investigate a conspiratorial charge by Trump’s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, that Obama and some of his aides engaged in a “treasonous conspiracy” by launching inquiries in 2016 into Russian efforts to influence that election to help Trump win.In another battle royale against facts, the health secretary and vaccine sceptic, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has stepped up efforts to block some vaccines that scientists regard as crucial weapons in fighting Covid and other diseases.Critics say Trump’s moves to undermine facts have been escalating in dangerous ways.“From government agencies to universities, the president is wielding the cudgel of federal money and the threat of presidential power to intimidate people whose data and ideas don’t support him,” said the Princeton political historian Julian Zelizer.Zelizer said: “While many presidents have been critical of economic data [such as Herbert Hoover], this is a new level of hostility. Someone says something he does not like, that person is removed. The point is to create fear so that others think twice before saying something that is harmful to the administration.”Shane of NYU warned that Trump’s administration allies have mimicked his actions.“Trump’s top officials, many of whom lack the experience, judgment, intellect and temperament to do their jobs properly, know Trump’s playbook and are determined to remain where they are … Everyone around Trump sees he has paid very little cost for his perfidy. They’re following the boss.”Leaders at key agencies have followed Trump’s playbook of attacking facts and widely accepted science with regulatory moves to undermine climate change science and alternative fuels.The EPA, as well as the interior and energy departments, has stepped up efforts to throttle spending and regulations to expand wind and solar energy; Trump has attacked green energy as part of his conspiratorial view that climate change is a “hoax”, while aggressively promoting his fossil fuel agenda of “drill, baby, drill”.“The Trump team has launched an all-of-government assault on wind and solar,” said Michael Gerrard, who runs the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.Gerrard said: “When Obama’s EPA issued the endangerment finding in 2009 there was a ton of scientific evidence supporting it. There are now 10 tons. There are a few ounces on the other side, but Trump’s EPA is seizing on the ounces as an excuse to wipe out our strongest legal tool to fight climate change.“The EPA, the energy and interior departments, and even the Federal Aviation Administration, are using all available tools, and making up some new ones, to suppress these sources of clean power.”Other experts and scientists are alarmed too that Kennedy has stepped up efforts to block vaccines he has long castigated without real evidence as dangerous.Earlier this month, Kennedy announced in a statement the ending of 22 projects worth $500m to develop mRNA technologies that have been used in vaccines to combat respiratory viruses such as Covid and the flu.In response to Kennedy’s move, Trump told reporters that “we’re on to other things” and said the administration was focused now on “looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases”.Trump, a former champion of the Covid vaccines, seems to have ignored several recent moves by Kennedy which health experts have sharply criticized. In July, Kennedy abruptly fired a 17-member CDC panel that recommends vaccines, and replaced it with a smaller committee that boasts some known vaccine sceptics.Further, Kennedy has balked at offering strong support for vaccinations even as the CDC reported 1,356 measles cases as of this month, the highest total of annual cases since 2000, when the United States declared measles eliminated.On a legal battlefront, former prosecutors say truth and facts are under assault at the justice department, which increasingly has acted without solid evidence of misconduct to investigate Trump’s declared foes, such as the former FBI director James Comey and ex-CIA director John Brennan.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The move came despite multiple reports, including one from the bipartisan Senate intelligence panel, concluding that Moscow mounted a drive to boost Trump.Trump’s comments followed Gabbard’s release of classified materials that did not support his allegations, say critics. Yet the attorney general, Pam Bondi, then impaneled a grand jury to investigate the charges as Gabbard requested.Some legal scholars see a pattern with earlier Trump tactics to fudge facts and revise history and warn of the justice department’s marked politicization under Trump and Bondi. The Columbia law professor and ex-federal prosecutor Daniel Richman said: “The announcement of a grand jury investigation into Obama and Biden officials [is] just the latest effort to support a false narrative with the presence of official action.”From a historical perspective, critics say the Trump administration’s assaults on truth and facts will do long-term damage.“The United States did not put a man on the moon or invent the transistor, the internet, the polio vaccine, or [on the negative side] the atomic bomb by ignoring or making up facts,” said Gerrard.“All these achievements resulted from scientists doing the very hard work of discovering truths about the physical world and using them in brilliant ways.“A country that instead ignores facts it doesn’t like and invents falsities can achieve very little beyond satisfying those who share the leaders’ ideology. We are on a dangerous path to mediocrity, or worse.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Victor discusses bootcamp with Barry Jenkins – and what you can learn from working in a bridal shopAdrian HortonMon 18 Aug 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn late 2020, the actor and comedian Eva Victor decamped from New York to their cousin’s house in rural Maine with a surprise window of time and an urgent subject. Covid had shut down production onBillions, Showtime’s soapy finance drama on which Victor scored their first regular acting gig. Moonlight directorBarry Jenkins, a fan of Victor’s short comedy videos on social media, had DM-ed to offer encouragement and a request: send a script when you’re ready.That year, everything felt incomprehensibly big – global pandemic, political upheaval, social fracturing. But alone in wintry Maine, Victor turned far inwards, towards a quiet personal trauma. “It’s like a stone gets shoved into the river of your life. There’s a lot of pain in trying to remove it and you can’t,” says Victor. “You just have to find a way for the water to move around it. It’s so unfair that someone threw a stone into your life. It’s hard to wrap your head around any of it.”I didn’t want to show the violence. I wanted to talk about what happens after itThe stone was sexual assault, and the film – Victor’s directorial debut, produced by Jenkins – isSorry, Baby, a remarkably sharp portrait of healing that quietly upends the prevailing script on sexual violence in the long wake of #MeToo.The film wowed audiences at Sundance and Cannes and garnered word-of-mouth buzz in the US when it was released in June, acclaimed for its welcome reimagining of what critic Parul Sehgal memorably termed the “trauma plot”: trauma as a flattening explanation and defining event. “I think we often paint people as victims,” says Victor. “In that way we make them tragic figures and try to look away from them. Or we make them just one thing, and people are complicated.”Sorry, Baby presents trauma as an idiosyncratic, fickle, mutable thing, as opposed to the blunt, annihilating force that animates numerous films and TV showsloosely grouped under the #MeToo umbrella, from the black heart of Emerald Fennell’sPromising Young Womanto the deadening shock of Zoë Kravitz’sBlink Twice.View image in fullscreenSoapy drama ... Victor in Billions.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyVictor plays Agnes, a twentysomething English academic in a small New England town who, about 25 minutes into the film, experiences something awful. She goes to the home of her thesis supervisor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), after he changes the location of their meeting at the last minute. The camera lingers outside the house, the darkening sky saying all you need to know. “I wanted the film to talk about what happens after this kind of violence,” says Victor. “I didn’t want to show it.”Afterwards Agnes drives home in mute horror, and tells her best friend, Lydie (Naomi Ackie), what happened in jumbled, detached details. Neither say the word rape, but they both know; Lydie confirms: “Yeah, that’s the thing.” The rest of the film, which proceeds in one chapter per year, builds on principles that feel true to life: that processing is non-linear and inconsistent; that the self is multifaceted and mutable; that life goes on in a whole variety of tones; that trauma can shape a person but not define them. “Ultimately we’re all just afraid,” says Victor. “We don’t want it to be possible that it could happen to someone like us. So we make it seem as if they are particular people who it’s meant to happen to.”View image in fullscreen‘I really wanted to give them a fighting chance at being whole people’ ... Victor.Photograph: Matt Licari/Invision/APIn conversation, Victor is much like their film: warm, chatty, at turns wise and childlike, their long sleeves covering their hands. We discuss the demise of a particularly excellent sandwich shop in Brooklyn, where Victor lived until relocating to Los Angeles last year. They now live in the same city as their best friend – fittingly, as the most important fact about Agnes, at least to the viewer, is her close friendship with Lydie. We first meet the pair four years after the assault, during a heady reunion marked by the half-finished thoughts and tangled limbs of intimate, platonic love. The trauma is tacitly acknowledged, shown clearly in the gulf between how Lydie’s life galloped – city, marriage, baby – while Agnes’s crawled. “I really wanted to give them a fighting chance at being whole people,” says Victor of the first chapter. “If Agnes and Lydie can be these full people who we love, it’s harder to look away from them later on when a bad thing happens. It’s harder to paint Agnes as something, or to categorise her.”The friendship also provides the canvas for comedy, and Sorry, Baby is – crucially – funny, its characters often speaking in stilted, off-the-cuff blurts. Victor walks a tonal tightrope between deadpan and earnest, the result of years spent working on a comedy career. Raised in San Francisco, they studied acting and playwriting at Northwestern University in Illinois and were active in the school’s improv scene. A few days after graduating in 2016, they moved to New York with aspirations to work on a late-night chatshow. They landed, instead, at the feminist satirical website Reductress, cranking out four to five posts a day (“insane”) and poking fun at the girlbossing cliches of the time. (“Get it, bitch! This woman got in the shower.”)For a few years, they lived the aspiring comic’s life in New York: standup sets, acting gigs and part-time jobs, including one fitting customers at a bridal shop. (“I was very bad at it,” says Victor, but “it taught me a lot about gender, and how euphoric it can be for some women to feel like women and how dysphoric it can feel for others.”) There were many unsuccessful auditions, scripts that “just weren’t landing. I was wanting to make things, but I felt as if no one was letting me. And I was like, ‘That’s not fair, I’m just going to do it.’”View image in fullscreenHard to look away from ... Naomi Ackie as Lydie and Victor as Agnes in Sorry, Baby.Photograph: BFA/AlamyVictor started posting short videos to what was then Twitter, in which they played arch, spiralling characters – a woman explaining to her boyfriend why they’re going to straight pride, a womanwhodefinitelydidn’t kill her husband. Many went viral. Jenkins messaged, and Victor took another crack at screenwriting, although not, they say, intending to speak to anything bigger than themselves, nor against a certain trauma trope. They drew from the interiority in Kelly Reichardt’s Certain Women, the understatement in Andrew Haigh’s45 Years, the beauty of Wong Kar-wai’sIn the Mood for Love. And they watched Michaela Coel’s “completely transcendent” BBC-HBO seriesI May Destroy You– perhaps the closest antecedent to Sorry, Baby in terms of treating trauma as a thread, rather than the whole cloth. “You see someone doing something so truthfully, and you wonder: ‘What’s my version of that?’” says Victor.After reading a first draft of the script in 2021, Jenkins encouraged Victor to direct. Having worked with first-time film-makers on two searing debuts – Charlotte Wells’sAftersunand Raven Jackson’sAll Dirt Roads Taste of Salt– Jenkins and his producing partners Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak put Victor in an ad-hoc directing bootcamp, practising certain shots and shadowing Jane Schoenbrun on the set of their acclaimed filmI Saw the TV Glow, before filming for Sorry, Baby commenced in Massachusetts in 2024.Sorry, Baby is a smart film about sexual assault and it’s here at just the right time | Adrian HortonRead moreAlthough years in the making, Sorry, Baby’s smallness, its bracing but uncynical honesty, feels of the moment. The collective momentum of the #MeToo movement has dissipated; backlash (and, often, hellish litigation) hasengulfedmany women who spoke up; catharsis did not lead to material change. Agnes and Lydie are pessimistic about the chances of accountability, and understandably wary of the criminal justice system. All Agnes has – all anyone has – is herself, her life, her friends. Victor still bristles at any larger movement critique; many times during this press tour, they’ve been asked some version of: What does this say about the #MeToo movement? “And I’m like, ‘Well, by the way, what are we even talking about?’” they laugh. “All I know is this one version of this story, all I want to talk about is this attempt at healing.”Victor is also reticent on the inspiration for that experience; making movies may be the opposite speed of social media posts, but virality taught Victor “how little I want people to know about my personal life”. They have maintained a privacy line throughout interviews for the film. “I say it’s a very personal story, which is true. And I say it is narrative fiction, in which I find a lot of comfort and joy, because I got to make Agnes and build a world around her that supports the exact story I want to tell.”And that story is not just trauma – it’s professional success, grief about friends entering a different life-stage, ambivalence about getting older, and the loneliness of being on your own timeline. Agnes, in these chapters, is “very much in process,” says Victor. “As we all are.”Sorry, Baby is in UK cinemas from 22 August and Australian cinemas from 4 SeptemberInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

And that was exactly what happened against Arsenal, United starting fairly well, only to concede a corner and fall behind in inexcusably soft circumstances. Usually, André Onana is the man responsible, but in his absence, Altay Bayindir seized the mantle with alacrity. We can be absolutely certain that Ruben Amorim has already told his bosses he must have a new keeper and, though they have already spent heavily, the position must be addressed as a matter of urgency because if it is not, this will continue happening and they might soon be facing questions about whether a new manager is necessary. It is pointless building a swish new house only for the owners to knowingly leave the back door open, get burgled and sack the builder.Daniel HarrisMatch report:Manchester United 0-1 ArsenalView image in fullscreenAltay Bayindir make a mess of an Arsenal corner before Riccardo Calafiori heads home from a yard out.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images2Ndoye and Wood spark Forest fireWhen Anthony Elanga departed for Newcastle, Forest knew they would face a difficult task replacing the speedy winger. Numerous potential targets were analysed and availability ascertained but they finally selected Dan Ndoye as the man to come in. The 24-year-old started on the right and caused problems for Rico Henry with his pace and trickery. Although Ndoye is not able to reach the same speeds as Elanga, no full-back will enjoy the prospect of facing the Swiss winger. Nuno Espírito Santo tested his speed by putting him through the middle at one point, getting him to turn theBrentforddefence and offer a different proposition to Chris Wood. A superbly taken header showed that there is plenty more to Ndoye’s game than merely trying to reach the byline and send in a cross. In previous years, Brentford were seen as intelligent recruiters but they are being outshone by Forest.Will UnwinMatch report:Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford3A Bridge too far for VAR?New seasons bring new directives. It is, of course, hard to fault the officials for implementing the laws of the game. Even so, nobody who actually enjoys football can have enjoyed seeing Eberechi Eze’s free-kick againstChelsearuled out because of Marc Guéhi being penalised for straying within a metre of the Chelsea wall while he grappled with Moisés Caicedo. The intervention felt way too pedantic and petty from the video assistant referee. There is talk of a light touch but this was surely too much interference. Eze’s free-kick was brutal and Guéhi’s positioning made no difference to whether Robert Sánchez was able to save it. Let’s see, too, if this law is applied throughout the season. This often happens at the start of a campaign – new tweaks to the laws are made and there is plenty of scrutiny on them early on, only for referees to stop being as stringent a few months in.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace4Baleba’s presence is pricelessCarlos Baleba, playing his first football for almost a month, showed why he is considered the next jewel off the Brighton production line. Still just 21, he was the player most in control amid an otherwise hurried, bitty midfield battle. Once he departed in the second half, Brighton lost control, and as late as Rodrigo Muniz’s goal came, it became ever more probable as time dragged on. The word from within Brighton is Baleba is resolutely not for sale, Fabian Hürzeler saying afterwards: “Together, we want to go with him and make with him the next step.” Brighton have each player’s pathway planned out, which invariably concludes with an eventual sale. Not just yet, though, at a club where patience is seen as a virtue. Three big summer signings, teenagers Stefanos Tzimas, Charalampos Kostoulas and Tommy Watson, were all made to wait for theirPremier Leaguedebuts. All must trust a process that delivers dividends for individuals and the club alike.John BrewinMatch report:Brighton 1-1 FulhamView image in fullscreenJorge Cuenca tries to stop the impressive Carlos Baleba as Brighton attack.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters5Walker faces up to fresh survival challengeAlmost 14 years after replacing him for his England debut against Spain in the days of Fabio Capello, Kyle Walker was handed his competitive Burnley debut by Scott Parker on Saturday. The 35-year-old couldn’t do much to prevent either of Richarlison’s goals as his former club Tottenham kicked off the Thomas Frank era in style but showed the kind of leadership that will be required if Burnley are to compete in the top flight. Walker is closing in on a century of England caps and has been selected in both of Thomas Tuchel’s squads so far. He will hope that a season that is expected to be spent fighting relegation will be enough to book a spot at next year’s World Cup. “At his age and the level where he’s come from and what he’s done, of course, this is a totally different project and something he’s not probably experienced this year, what he’s going to face,” admitted Parker of the six-time Premier League winner withManchester City. “But I know Kyle well, and I know he’ll face up to that.”Ed Aaronsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had been a long time in the making for the goalkeeper. This summer Trafford rejoined City two years after leaving forBurnleyand 10 years after first joining City aged 12 from Carlisle. There are suggestions City will move for Gianluigi Donnarumma if Ederson departs for Galatasaray as mooted but Trafford, viewed as the long-term England No 1, has staked his claim, saving smartly from Jørgen Strand Larsen when required. “He’s tall, his presence is really good,” said Pep Guardiola. “The fans love having homegrown players from the academy playing for us.”Ben FisherMatch report:Wolves 0-4 Manchester City7Fans have to provide the entertainmentHow sadly emblematic of the modern game that supporters save their most entertaining chants for criticising the financial state of the game.Aston Villafans voiced their dissatisfaction at the governing bodies’ rules (“Premier League and Uefa, your rules are fucked” didn’t quite scan) that dictate they’re not allowed to overspend their income by more than £105m over a three-year period for Premier League regulations, or exceed Uefa’s remit to avoid paying wages at more than 70% of their revenue, which they have done every year since their 2019 promotion. How darned unfair of the authorities. Meanwhile, Newcastle fans applauded their willing workers during and at the end of their gutsy goalless draw at Villa Park before finally giving Alexander Isak both barrels by claiming there’s “only one greedy bastard” as their star striker continued to make himself unavailable to play as he attempts to dig his way out to Liverpool. Will they be having a word with Yoane Wissa, who has been linked with a move to Newcastle and did not play for Brentford on Sunday? If only we had an independent body to help regulate these matters …Peter LansleyMatch report:Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle8Pensioners and Potter in focusSunderland have more than 80 season-ticket holders aged 85 and over. As a thank you for their support in recent troubled years, the promoted club have given them all free seats for the entire campaign. It’s a wonderful gesture and, after Saturday’s 3-0 home win, all the evidence is that the recipients could be in for a treat. The only caveat is that Régis Le Bris’s skilfully blended team cannot play West Ham every week. With Habib Diarra and Granit Xhaka – two of eight home debutants – shining, goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor suggested a troubled season may await Graham Potter. “I understand the scoreline doesn’t look pretty for us,” said West Ham’s manager. “We have to accept the criticism and we have to do better. We can’t wait for the opposition to give us points.” Potter must hope the improvement begins at home to Chelsea on Friday night. With Lucas Paquetá disappointing in a visiting side for whom only Jarrod Bowen really impressed, the portents are not promising.Louise TaylorMatch report:Sunderland 3-0 West HamView image in fullscreenSunderland’s Dan Ballard is mobbed by his teammates after scoring the second goal against West Ham.Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters9Gunners fail to impress at Old TraffordA win over Manchester United is an excellent start to a season; in a similar vein, it is silly to draw lasting conclusions after one game and it is not cheating to score regularly from set pieces. WatchingArsenalat Old Trafford, though, there was little sense that anything has changed over the summer: they were still solid at the back, unimaginative in midfield and uninspired in attack. Viktor Gyökeres will surely score goals, but looked nevertheless like a blunt instrument, able to run channels and physically assert without suggesting he can create for himself or settle games with a moment of brilliance. Of course, it may well be that the goals he adds are enough – Arsenal have not been far away in any of the last three seasons. Yet throughout them all, there has been a sense that, good though they are, at least one other team will be better – and that still remains the case.Daniel Harris10Cherries picked off but ready to growThe problem for clubs whose identity is based on buying low to sell high is that they have always to replenish – and any signing is always something of a risk. It felt Bournemouth’s final league position last season didn’t quite reflect how good they’d been, which in turn felt as though it might have been something of a missed opportunity, as four of their first-choice back five (if you include the goalkeeper) and Dango Ouattara all left. Perhaps they might have been slightly more solid had a couple more of those defenders remained but even though they let in four againstLiverpool, there were enough positive signs to suggest that they’ll be at least mid-table this season. The press remained aggressive and focused enough to unsettle the champions, Evanilson was as big a handful as ever, Antoine Semenyo had an exceptional game and the new left-back Adrien Truffert showed enough to suggest he might be able to replicate the forward thrust of Milosz Kerkez.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Liverpool 4-2 BournemouthExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballManchester UnitedArsenalNottingham ForestChelseaCrystal PalaceBrentfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They are also studying whether, after the national tax, a local property tax could then replace council tax in the medium term in an effort to repair battered local authority finances.Treasury targeting inheritance tax reforms to help plug UK deficitRead moreNo final decisions have been made. A national tax could be implemented during this parliament, while it is understood an overhaul of council tax would take longer, at least requiring Labour to win a second term in office.The policy options are being considered as part of a large tranche of work within the Treasury aimed at tapping into the vast cumulative rise in house prices in recent years that risks entrenching inequalities and making council tax – which is based on early 1990s property values – more unfair.If the plans came to fruition, they could provide valuable political cover for Reeves, both in terms of raising extra revenue without breaking Labour’s pledge to not raise levies on working people and as policies that would be likely to appeal to many of the party’s MPs and members.There has been increasing pressure on the chancellor to consider more wealth-based taxes, notably from the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, and the additional tax on more expensive homes could be presented in this light.The national tax would be paid by owner-occupiers on houses worth more than £500,000 when they sell their home. The amount paid would be determined by the value of the property, with the rate set by central government, which would directly collect the proceeds via HM Revenue and Customs. It would not replace stamp duty on second homes.Currentrates of stamp dutyvary depending on whether someone is a first-time buyer and are banded in steps upward depending on the value of the property being bought and sold.It would take time to phase in a replacement to stamp duty, and a range of options are being considered for phasing in changes. The revenue raised by stamp duty on primary residences varies considerably from year to year, depending on housing market conditions. In the last financial year, it raised £11.6bn,according to government figures. Over time, it is believed the new national property tax would be a more reliable, consistent source of revenue and ultimately raise the same amount as stamp duty.The levy would only affect about a fifth of property sales, compared with about 60% with current levels of stamp duty, which is paid by the buyer of a home. Theaverage price of a homein the UK was £272,664 in July, according to Nationwide.Sources said Treasury officials were, in part, drawing on the findings ofa 48-page reportfrom the centre-right thinktank Onward, which was published in August last year.Onward’s report proposes a dual approach of a national and local “proportional property tax” on property, based on its value. It is written by Dr Tim Leunig, who worked as a government adviser for more than a decade and was closely involved with devising the furlough scheme during the Covid-19 pandemic.Leunig wrote: “These proposals would make it easier and cheaper to move house, for a better job, or to be near family, as well as being fairer. It should not be the case that a terrace house in Burnley pays more than a mansion in Kensington – and it wouldn’t be under these proposals.”The governmenthas already showed signalsof adopting some of the steps towards council tax Leunig laid out in his report: “The first step would be to end the overfunding of various councils in affluent areas of inner London, particularly Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington and Chelsea councils.” This is similar to the approach laid out this summer in a consultation on how to redistribute from richer to poorer councils.The idea of a new local annual property levy to replace council tax was also proposed by Onward. That plan would result in owners, rather than the residents, of a property worth up to £500,000 paying varying rates of tax dependent on the value of their home. They would pay a minimum of £800 a year and the funds this generates would go directly to local councils, whose finances have been severely stretched in recent years.Rayner has already raised the prospect of ramping up redistributions of funds to address regional inequalities, which she has argued are exacerbated by the existing council tax system, which replaced the poll tax in 1993.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Changes to tax and spend policy are not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are expected to grow the economy by £6.8bn and cut borrowing by £3.4bn.“We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at last autumn’s budget, we protected working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.”Economists from the right and left of the political spectrum have heavily criticised stamp duty and council tax. Stamp duty applies in England and Northern Ireland. There are different approaches to some land taxes in Wales and Scotland.Council taxbanding based on older property values is considered flawed and out of date by economists in all parts of the UK and is believed to be ripe for reform.In June, the government launched a consultation on how to reform the allocation of funds raised by council tax. Labour said the “fair funding review” aims to fix the “broken funding system we inherited” which has “left local authorities across the country in crisis”.The strategy has already meta backlashafter it emerged deprived inner-city London councils stand to lose millions of pounds.The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an economic thinktank, has said that while reform was very much needed, the proposed changes in the government’s funding review appeared to run counter to an “expectation that deprived and urban areas would win at the expense of more affluent and rural areas, the government’s baseline funding reform proposals are not particularly redistributive to poor, urban areas of England”.While any wealth-related tax could provoke strong criticism from rightwing opponents, ministers have shown willingness to ignore such criticism for policies that generally affect wealthier people, such as adding VAT on private school fees and changes to inheritance tax for some farms.If billed as a part of a longer-term replacement of stamp duty, this could also be helpful given the existing levy is unpopular and widely seen as a blunt tool and a block on the property market.Using property taxes as a replacement for council tax would be complex to implement and almost inevitably require a second term in office, but there is an increasing acceptance among all the main parties that the current system for local government funding is obsolete and unviable.Labour has already committed to the biggest shake-up of council structures in England for decades but does not want to oversee the predicted series of local authorities declaring effective bankruptcy, especially as many will be run by the party.Last week, the Guardian revealed that the Treasury was alsolooking at ways to raise more money from inheritance taxin an attempt to ease pressure on the country’s finances, in the run-up to Reeves’s autumn budget.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

New protectionsintroduced in July by Ofcom, part of the Online Safety Act, provide a real opportunity to make children’s safety online a non-negotiable priority for everyone: policymakers, big tech giants and smaller tech developers.”The findings are from a nationally representative survey of 1,010 children and young people aged 16-21 carried out in May, shortly before the introduction of Ofcom’s children’s codes in July.The rules introduced by Ofcom have introduced significant changes to make it tougher for under-18-year-olds to access porn websites. Using the same methodology and questions as the 2023 survey to ensure consistency, it found:More young people said they had seen porn before the age of 18 in 2025 (70%) compared with 2023 (64%).More than a quarter (27%) said they had seen porn online by 11. The average age a child first sees pornography remained 13.More vulnerable children had seen pornography earlier.Childrenwho received free school meals, those with a social worker, those with special educational needs and those with disabilities – both physical and mental – were more likely to have seen online porn by 11 than their peers.Nearly half of respondents (44%) agreed with the statement “Girls may say no at first but then can be persuaded to have sex”. Further analysis showed that 54% of girls and 41% of boys who had seen porn online agreed with the statement, compared with 46% of girls and 30% of boys who had not seen porn – indicating a link between porn exposure and attitudes.More respondents said they had seen pornography online by accident (59%) than said they had deliberately sought it out (35%). The proportion of children accidentally seeing porn was 21 points higher than in 2023 (59% v 38%).Networking and social media sites accounted for 80% of the main sources by which children accessed porn. X was the most common source of pornography for children, outstripping dedicated porn sites.The gap between the number of children seeing pornography on X and those seeing it on dedicated porn sites has widened (45% v 35% in 2025, compared with 41% v 37% in 2023).Most respondents had seen depictions of acts that are illegal under existing pornography laws or will become illegal through the crime and policing bill.More than half (58%) had seen porn depicting strangulation, 44% reported having seen depictions of sex while asleep, and 36% had seen someone not consenting to or refusing a sex act, before they turned 18.Further analysis found low numbers of children sought out violent or extreme content, meaning it was being served up to children, not that they were actively seeking it out.The report expresses concern that even under the new rules, children will be able to circumvent restrictions by downloading a virtual private network (VPN), which remains legal software in the UK.The report recommends that online pornography should meet the same requirements as offline pornography; that the depiction of non-fatal strangulation should be outlawed; and that the Department for Education should provide schools with the support needed to implement the new relationships, health and sex education curriculum.It emerged last week that the number of people in the UK visiting the most popular pornography sites haddecreased sharplysince enhanced age verification rules came into force. The data analytics firm Similarweb said the leading adult site Pornhub lost more than 1 million visitors in just two weeks.Pornhub and other major adult websites introduced advanced age checks on 25 July after the Online Safety Act said sites must make it harder for under-18s to see explicit material.Similarweb compared the daily average user figures of popular pornography sites from 1 to 9 August with the daily average figures for July. Pornhub is the UK’s most visited website for adult content and it had a 47% decrease in traffic in the country between 24 July, one day before the new rules came into place, and 8 August, according to Similarweb’s data.A government spokesperson said: “Children have been left to grow up in a lawless online world for too long, bombarded with pornography and harmful content that can scar them for life. The Online Safety Act is changing that.“Let’s be clear: VPNs are legal tools for adults and there are no plans to ban them. But if platforms deliberately push workarounds like VPNs to children, they face tough enforcement and heavy fines. We will not allow corporate interests to come before child safety. This is about drawing a line – no more excuses, no more loopholes. Protecting children online must come first.”Explore more on these topicsPornographyInternet safetyChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

officials say they have accepted a proposal for a Gaza ceasefire deal that would include the release of half of the approximately 20 remaining living Israeli hostages as part of a phased resolution to the war, as Gaza health officials said 62,000 Palestinians had died in the 22 months of war.The proposed deal follows negotiations between Hamas and Egyptian and Qatari officials that have been taking place in Cairo in recent days, and comes after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was confronted on Sunday byIsrael’s biggest protests of the war, which called for a deal to secure the release of the hostages.Netanyahu has criticised the large-scale street protests against his handling of the Gaza war, and his failure to secure the release of the remaining hostages, claiming that demonstrators were giving comfort to Hamas’s position in negotiations.Organisers of the protests, for their part, have called for a fresh demonstrations this Sunday.Hundreds of thousands of protesters gather in Tel Aviv to demand end to Gaza warRead moreThe latest Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed by Hamas includes a suspension of military operations for 60 days and could be seen as a path to reach a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-long war, according to Egyptian sources.During the period of suspension, Palestinian prisoners would be exchanged in return for half of the Israeli hostages held inGaza.The suggestion of movement in the long-running ceasefire negotiations comes as Egypt – long regarded as a key mediator between Hamas and Israel – has taken a more central role in the talks, and amid threats by Israel to launch a large new military offensive to take control of Gaza City, potentially displacing up to 1 million Palestinians.The proposal was expected to be presented to Israel on Monday, although Netanyahu has said Israel is no longer interested in part deals, saying it will only agree to end the war if Hamas releases all of the hostages at once, disarms, and allows for the demilitarisation of Gaza.Realistically, however, the latest round of talks – which Arab mediators suggest has gone a long way towards meeting previous Israeli objections, and is based on a US-proposed framework – is bound to feed into a febrile political situation in Israel, which is facing growing and acrimonious social and political divisions.1:33Israel protests erupt nationwide to demand end of Gaza war – videoNetanyahu has faced high-profile pushback from senior security officials who have warned that the lives of the remaining hostages could be in peril in the event of a new offensive to take Gaza City, warnings that have fed into the mass protests.The Israeli government’s plan to seize control of Gaza City has stirred alarm at home and abroad, as it has come under intensifying international pressure over growing starvation in Gaza, which it is blamed for, and accusations of genocide.Talks have been continuing in Egypt with participants including the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the head of Egypt’s general intelligence service, and representatives of the Palestinian factions in Gaza, who are under pressure to reach a deal.While Netanyahu received the backing of the US president, Donald Trump, on Monday for “confronting and defeating Hamas”, the vast scale of the demonstrations in Israel on Sunday – involving more than 400,000 people – suggested an increasing weariness in the country over the war and fury about missed opportunities to secure the hostages’ release.In response to the protests, Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, accused those participating of giving comfort to Hamas.He said in a statement: “The people who are calling today for the war’s end without Hamas’s defeat are not only toughening Hamas’s stance and distancing our hostages’ release, they are also ensuring that the atrocities of October 7 will recur time and again, and that our sons and daughters will have to fight time and again in an endless war.“Therefore, in order to advance our hostages’ release and to ensure thatGazano longer poses a threat to Israel, we have to finish the job and defeat Hamas.”Israeli plan to displace 1 million Palestinians spreads fear in GazaRead moreWith 50 hostages still held in Gaza – of whom about 20 are believed to be alive – some of those attending the march carried signs referencing the death of the dual US-Israeli citizenHersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed by his captors last October along with five other hostages as Israeli troops approached the place where they were being held.Placards repeated a sentiment expressed by Goldberg-Polin’s father at his son’s funeral – “May your memory be a revolution” – adapting the familiar Jewish expression of condolence: “May your memory be a blessing.”Responding to Netanyahu’s remarks, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum lambasted the Israeli prime minister, saying: “They have been languishing in Gaza for 22 months, on your watch.”Netanyahu was also fiercely criticised by the leader of the Israeli opposition Democrats party, Yair Golan, as a man who “lies as he breathes”. He said: “The man who time and again refused to eliminate Hamas’s leaders before October 7, who funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar to finance the tunnels and weapons that threaten our hostages.“This is the same Netanyahu who strengthened Hamas back then, and it is he who is strengthening Hamas now as well. Netanyahu doesn’t know how to win and doesn’t want to free the hostages. He needs an eternal war in order to cling to his seat and to escape a commission of inquiry [into the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered the war].”Amid the threat of an imminent Israeli ground offensive, thousands of Palestinians have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, under constant Israeli bombardment, for points in the west and south of the shattered territory.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelQatarEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

I want to be clear that I intend to use these proceeds of my work, as well as my public platform generally, to go on supporting Palestine Action and direct action against genocide in whatever way I can.”Palestine Action was proscribed as a terrorist organisation after activists broke into an RAF base in Oxfordshire and spray painted two planes. They “knew, of course, that their actions were illegal”, Rooney wrotein the Guardian in June. “From the suffragettes to the gay rights movement to the anti-apartheid struggle, genuine political resistance has always involved intentional law-breaking.”In her Irish Times article last weekend, Rooney said that she “would happily publish this statement in a UK newspaper – but that would now be illegal”. Rooney’s books also include Beautiful World, Where Are You and, most recently, Intermezzo.The lawyer and writer Sadakat Kadri said: “Receiving money with the intention of using it to support terrorism is an offence under section 15 of the 2000 act. That means Rooney could be arrested without a warrant as a ‘terrorist’.”He added that “the absurdities don’t end there”, and said the decision of the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to bracket Palestine Action with groups such as Islamic State meant the BBC would also be criminally liable if it continued to pay royalties to Rooney in view of her stated intentions.“Authoritarian governments routinely threaten writers and intimidate broadcasters, but I find it quite extraordinary that Labour under Keir Starmer has now chosen to go down the same path.”Asked whether Rooney could face legal repercussions if she, for example, spoke at a book festival in the UK, Kadri said that “there’s certainly a risk she’d fall foul” of the law. If Rooney expressed “her views in terms of condemning the war crimes being committed in Gaza, an arguable case for prosecution could be made out”.“Saying that isn’t for one moment an attempt to justify the statute,” said Kadri, which he described as “a shameful attack” on free speech. “It’s just a particularly stark illustration of the measure’s gross disproportionality.”Mike Schwarz, head of the public inquiry team at the legal firm Hodge Jones & Allen, said that “anyone providing money which might, in the state’s eyes, fund ‘terrorism’ and, separately, anyone supporting an organisation proscribed under terrorism legislation runs a very real risk of serious police interest and prosecution for grave offences in the UK. This seems particularly the case in the current febrile political climate surrounding Palestine Action.”Explore more on these topicsBooksSally RooneyIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

They includeBirmingham,NottinghamandWoking.The Audit Reform Lab at Sheffield said the average cost of external auditors checking a local authority’s finances was now at least £50,000 higher in cash terms than when the Audit Commission was disbanded in 2015.Private-sector accountancy firms took over the job of auditing local government accounts in England after the agency was abolished, in an austerity-driven push by Tory and Lib Dem ministers to find savings and efficiencies.“Ten years on, however, it now seems clear that these reform ambitions have failed,” the authors of the report wrote.“Only 1% of audits were delivered on time in 2022-23, with many audits delayed by several years. Audit costs have risen dramatically in response. An unwieldy, but ultimately operational centralised bureaucracy was replaced by market chaos. The £100m per annum savings heralded by the UK government in 2014 are now a distant memory.”The report found that average audit costs in England had more than tripled – an average increase of 238% – in the year to 2023-24. It blamed most of this increase on private-sector auditors hiking their rates.It compared the large rise in audit costs in England to much smaller increases in Scotland and Wales, where it said there was a much stronger level of central oversight of private-sector auditing.Some of the biggest increases were at financially stricken councils, including a 620% rise in audit fees at Woking, as well as leaps of 470% at Runnymede and 450% at Spelthorne.In total 13 councils had fee scale increases of 300% or more in 2022-23. Birmingham city council paid an audit fee above the £1m mark, representing a 314% increase. The councils were approached for comment.Three auditors dominate the local audit market: EY, Grant Thornton and Forvis Mazars. Others including Deloitte and BDO have exited because profit margins are considered too low, while complexity and risks have risen.EY and Grant Thornton declined to comment. A spokesperson for Forvis Mazars said: “We are working closely with all stakeholders including MHCLG [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government] and remain committed to supporting the return to the delivery of good quality audits for local authorities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers then allowed accounts to be completed with qualifications – whereby an auditor signs off but expresses reservations – to clear the backlog.A new Local Audit Office is also being established to centralise previously fragmented oversight of the process.An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We have taken decisive action to restore the broken audit system, providing £49m to help councils clear backlogs – but we know there is more to do. This is why we will set up a new Local Audit Office to simplify the system and increase capacity by establishing public sector audit provision.“This will ensure the local audit system provides accountability, transparency, and value for money for taxpayers.”Runnymede council said it was on a sound financial footing and did not recognise the fees quoted in the Audit Reform Lab report.Explore more on these topicsAccountancyLocal governmentFinancial sectorLiberal-Conservative coalitionEnglandAusteritynewsShareReuse this content"

Nearly half (45%) of those polled planned to use credit cards to pay for theirchildren’s school uniformand a third (34%) said they would rely on Klarna-style delayed payment services.Labour says cap on school uniform items could save families £50 a childRead moreThe education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, urged schools to help struggling parents by reducing the number of branded items of uniform that pupils are required to wear as a matter of urgency, before a forthcomingchange in the law.A limit of three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, will be enforced from September 2026 after the government’s children’s wellbeing and schools bill becomes law, but Phillipson wants schools to act sooner on a voluntary basis.“School uniform matters but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” she said. “Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items – and that’s exactly what we’re delivering.Schoolscan help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.”Currently, schools can require parents to buy multiple items branded with a school logo, often from specialist suppliers, with many asking for more than five and in some cases 10 items, pushing total uniform costs up to £400 including PE kit.Under the new legislation, parents will be able to buy cheaper uniform staples such as shirts or trousers from general retailers including Aldi and Marks & Spencer.Nearly nine out of 10 parents (86%) who took part in the poll – which involved parents of children aged four to 15 attending state schools in England – felt that wearing branded uniforms made no difference to behaviour.Parentkind’s chief executive, Jason Elsom, said: “Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride.”Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Many families face wider financial pressures and cannot afford basic amenities. The rate of child poverty in the UK is simply appalling. We hope to see the government publish a meaningful strategy to tackle this issue in the near future.”The government has announced that millions of families will receive their benefit payments before the August bank holiday this year, with payments originally due on Saturday 23, Sunday 24 and Monday 25 August paid early on Friday 22 August.The minister for social security and disability, Stephen Timms, said: “This is especially important ahead of the new school year – no family should have to choose between buying school supplies and putting food on the table.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsEducation policyEnglandSchool brandingnewsShareReuse this content"

The MP met protesters including a woman with a T-shirt bearing the message: “Send them home.”Eddy Butler, a well-known figure in far-right circles who was a key strategist in the rise of the British National party, can be seen wearing sunglasses in the background of one of the photosJenrick shared after the visit.It is not clear whether Jenrick met Butler, but the photo was seized on by far-right figures eager to exploit the protest, which they have heavily promoted.Butler boasted to friends about Jenrick’s appearance in a post on his Facebook account: “At the Bell Hotel, riding shotgun for Robert Jenrick, pretender to the Tory leadership.”ALabourparty spokesperson described Jenrick as “a disgrace” for attending a protest “organised by a far-right party”, which was also attended by someone with “a long history of involvement with neo-Nazi groups”.“Jenrick once proudly boasted about ramping up the procurement of asylum hotels when he was immigration minister. It shows, at best, a staggering lack of judgment,” the spokesperson said.“Kemi Badenoch must show some leadership, explain what action she’s going to take against her shadow justice secretary, and demonstrate that she is strong enough to stand up against this challenge to her authority and to basic decency.”A source close to Jenrick insisted that the MP had “no idea” who the formerBNPstrategist was and did not speak to him at the protest rally.Jenrick said in his post on X: “Great to be with peaceful, patriotic protesters in Epping today.“People are right to be fed up of illegal migration. And the crime and billions being wasted because of it.”Lewis Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, which has been organising counter-protests in Epping, said Jenrick was willing to go on protests attended by far-right activists.“These aren’t ‘concerned parents’ or ‘local residents’. Jenrick is fanning the flames of the far right by chasing Reform UK votes – and he’s giving confidence to known fascists.”Butler, a former member of the National Front, has been a prominent figure in the British far right for decades, helping to guide the BNP during the 1990s and 2000s.In 1992 he helped establish a BNP “stewards” group, made up of skinheads and hooligans, to act as “security” against antifascists. This group becamethe neo-Nazi terrorist group Combat 18, according to Hope Not Hate.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickImmigration and asylumThe far rightConservativesLabourEssexEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

A tractor became separated from its trailer before falling on to the central reservation between junctions 2 and 3 of the M20.Police earlier believed two vehicles were involved in the collision. They have called for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage of the collision to come forward.The man’s next of kin are aware of the incident and he remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Kent fire and rescue service and south east coast ambulance service also attended the incident, and remain at the scene, the force said.The M20 and the A227 remain closed while emergency services deal with the incident, with motorists advised to use alternative routes. Images and footage shared on social media showed a tractor upside down with railings bent in the central reservation.Large queues of vehicles were forming on either side of the bridge. South east coast ambulance service said it was called to reports of a collision involving a tractor and a lorry on the bridge at about 11.20am.Multiple crews, a critical care paramedic and the local air ambulance were sent to the scene. The driver of the tractor was airlifted to King’s College hospital in London, the service said.National Highways said the M20 was expected to be closed in both directions between junctions 1 and 3 into Monday evening for emergency repairs and resurfacing, after damaged caused from the collision and a subsequent fuel spillage.Anyone with relevant information should contact police on the west Kent appeals line on 01622 604100, quoting reference 18-0475.Explore more on these topicsRoad transportKentnewsShareReuse this content"

The idea is also deeply unpopular at home: about 75% of Ukrainians oppose formally ceding any land to Russia, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.Putin’s drive to dominate the region dates back to 2014 when Moscow armed and financed separatist proxies and sent covert troops across the border. That campaign escalated into the full-scale invasion of 2022, when Russian forces seized much of the region outright.Today, Russia holds about 17980 square miles (46,570 sq km), or roughly 88%, of Donbas, including the entirety of Luhansk and about three-quarters of Donetsk.Ukraine continues to hold several key cities and fortified positions in the Donetsk region, defended at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. More than 250,000 civilians remain in the parts of the region still under Ukrainian control.Where is Donbas and why does Putin want it?Short for Donets Basin, Donbas is an industrial heartland in eastern Ukraine rich in coal and heavy industry. It has long been one of Ukraine’s most Russian-speaking regions, shaped by waves of Russian migration during the Soviet industrial drive that turned its coalmines and steel plants into the engine of the USSR.Its political loyalties often leaned eastwards: Viktor Yanukovych, theKremlin-backed president ousted in 2014, was born in Donetsk and built his power base there.Donbas was thrust into conflict in 2014 after Yanukovych was toppled by mass protests and fled the country. In the aftermath, Moscow seized Crimea and unrest spread across eastern Ukraine. Armed groups backed by Russian weapons and fighters declared the creation of self-proclaimed “people’s republics” in Donetsk and Luhansk.The separatist war fuelled resentment toward Moscow in Ukraine-held parts of Donbas. In Ukraine’s 2019 presidential election, voters there backed Zelenskyy by a wide margin. A Russian speaker himself, Zelenskyy campaigned on ending the conflict while safeguarding Ukraine’s sovereignty.From the outset of the invasion in February 2022, Putin cast the protection of Donbas residents as a central justification for launching what he termed his “special military operation”. In a televised address, he said the self-proclaimed people’s republics of Donetsk and Luhansk had appealed to Moscow for help, and he repeated unfounded claims that Russian-speaking residents were facing “genocide” at the hands of Kyiv.In reality, Donbas served as a pretext: within hours, Russian forces advanced far beyond the region, driving on Kyiv in an attempt to overthrow Zelenskyy’s government and seize control of the entire country.Donbas mapHow does the average Russian view Donbas?For years, Russian state media tried to cultivate sympathy for Donbas, portraying Ukraine as discriminating against its Russian-speaking population, but it never truly struck a chord with the wider public.Unlike Crimea, which carried deep historical and emotional resonance for many Russians, Donbas remained a more distant and industrial region with little symbolic weight.On the eve of the full-scale invasion, independent polls showed that only about a quarter of Russians supported the idea of incorporating Donetsk and Luhansk into Russia.Since the invasion, however, the narrative has shifted: surveys indicate that a majority of Russians accept and support Putin’s stated aim of “protecting” the population of Donbas, and a majority back the annexation of the territories.Will Putin’s ambitions end with Donbas?Putin reportedly told Donald Trump in Alaska that in exchange for Donetsk and Luhansk, he would halt further advances and freeze the frontline in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russian forces occupy significant areas.In public, Putin has repeatedly said Russia is seeking full control of the four regions it claimed to have annexed in autumn 2022, including Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He has also spoken of establishing so-called “buffer zones” inside Ukraine’s Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv regions.“Putin has acted opportunistically; when he launched the invasion he had no fixed territorial limits in mind,” said a former high ranking Kremlin official. “His appetite grows once he’s tasted success.”Military analysts doubt whether Russia has the economic or military capacity to push much beyond Donbas and say the conflict could instead drag on for years as a grinding war of attrition in Ukraine.Ukraine has warned that conceding Donbas, with its string of fortified cities such as Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, would hand Russia a launchpad for deeper advances into central Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeexplainersShareReuse this content"

A pint of bitter cost £1.63 and a packet of 20 cigarettes sold for about £2.94.After 28 years of exile in Poland, Lee, an English teacher, flew back to Britain a fortnight ago, his ticket paid for by the Home Office, where staff had belatedly acknowledged he was a victim of theWindrush scandaland allowed him to return.He first contacted MPs and Home Office workers to request assistance in summer 2018as the Windrush scandal unfolded. He says consular officials in Poland and Home Office staff in the UK failed to help him return despite the government’s repeated proclamations that everything was being done to assist those affected.Currently accommodated in a hotel room in Birmingham, Lee travelled toLondonlast week, stepping off the train at Euston station into a city so transformed in the past three decades that he was instantly overwhelmed by culture shock.“Nothing is the same – the taxis are different, the buses are different,” he said, as he made his way into the underground, puzzled by the Oyster card system. “What do I do with this? Tap and go through?”He has spent the last two weeks walking around the streets, attempting to reacclimatise to the country he moved to from Jamaica in 1961 as an eight-year-old, assessing why he does not yet feel at home, despite the 37 years he lived here before being locked out.He is relieved to be back, but startled by the intense sense of dislocation after so long away. “So much has changed. The homelessness is horrible – much worse than inPoland,” he said. “People here look so stressed, there’s a tiredness etched on their faces, as if they don’t know what to expect of tomorrow. It’s a little depressing. It’s clear that the quality of life is better in Poland than here, which feels very sad.”‘It’s about justice’: the couple pushing for legal aid for Windrush scandal claimsRead moreLee, 72, is one of a number ofvictimsof the Windrush scandal who were prevented from returning to Britain after travelling abroad for work, or holiday orfunerals; some were stopped by local border staff; many were given no assistance by UK consular officials who refused to acknowledge their right to travel to the UK. Lee says he struggled to persuade Home Office staff, MPs and officials at the UK consulate in Poland that he should be given help to return home, despite repeated appeals for assistance.It was only last November when he contacted Desmond Jaddoo, a Windrush campaigner and Birmingham-based bishop who runs the Windrush National Organisation support group, that Lee was able to collect the documentary evidence needed to demonstrate that he should be allowed to return.“His case was a straightforward one, so it was easy to get him back once the documents were gathered,” Jaddoo said, adding that he was puzzled by why Lee had not received help to return sooner. Jaddoo traced school records, a marriage certificate, and Lee’s son’s birth certificate, proving he had a right to live in the UK. “We worry that there are other cases like this. We need a proper campaign to encourage people who remain stuck abroad to come forward.”View image in fullscreenLee with the Windrush campaigner Desmond Jaddoo (right), who said he was puzzled by why Lee had not received help sooner.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianLee moved to London in 1961, the year before Jamaican independence, travelling with his younger brother on his aunt’s passport, to join his mother who was working as a nurse in east London, and his plumber father who was working on the North Sea oil pipelines. On arrival he would have been classified as a citizen of the UK and Colonies.He went to Princess May primary school in north London, where he passed the 11-plus and transferred to Dame Alice Owen’s grammar school. He worked as a financial analyst in the City of London for a while, opened his own barbershop, before later deciding that teaching was his vocation. He married and had a son, but by the time he went to take up a teaching job in Poland the marriage had ended. He travelled to Warsaw on a Jamaican passport because he had failed to persuade UK officials that he was entitled to a British passport, despite having arrived in the country 37 years earlier.Because he stayed slightly over two years, he inadvertently breached the terms of his immigration status as someone who had been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He was advised by staff at the Polish border that he would not be readmitted to the UK. Lee argued that he should have been recognised as a British citizen, because that was his status when he arrived as an eight-year-old. Throughout his time in Poland he was undocumented, which meant it was impossible to open a bank account.He taught English to hundreds of students. In one of the many emails he addressed to theHome Officein 2018, he noted that he had helped many Polish students pass exams to study at UK universities, and had at least 10 ex-students who now held PhDs from British institutions. “Can you imagine how it feels preparing all these people to go to the UK, when I, as a citizen of the UK, cannot even enter. Believe me it is soul-destroying,” he wrote.Lee made contact with the Windrush taskforce, which was set up as a result of the scandal in 2018, with a view to securing the necessary documentation to return to Britain, and explained he wanted help from the British embassy in Warsaw. When he went there to seek advice, a Polish employee was sent to speak to him on the pavement outside. “They refused to let me inside the building,” Lee said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He hopes to track them down and re-establish contact, but feels nervous about reconnecting. “I wonder if, during all the years I’ve been away, they have thought I abandoned them,” he said. In the next few weeks he needs to find somewhere permanent to live, reregister with a doctor and sort out his pension. He is dismayed that officials are refusing to grant back payments of his state pension going back to 2018, when he turned 65.The barrister Martin Forde KC, who served as the independent adviser to the Windrush compensation scheme from 2018 to 2022, working to recompense those affected by the scandal that led to thousands of people who were living in the UK legally being misclassified as immigration offenders with catastrophic consequences for many. Some people lost their jobs or were evicted from their homes, or were denied benefits, free healthcare, and pensions; a few were arrested and deported to countries they had left decades earlier as children. Others were stuck for years abroad. Forde said Lee should be granted pension payments, adding: “It seems inequitable not to give him the pension that he would otherwise have received.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Lee after arriving back in the UK for the first time in 28 years.Photograph: Windrush FoundationWhen he feels more settled, Lee plans to visit the graves of his mother and younger brother in London, and revisit the London cinemas where he developed a love of French arthouse film.He is not ready to apply for compensation from the government because he does not believe ministers have acknowledged that immigration legislation which remains in place caused many of the Windrush generation’s problems. A long-buried Home Office-commissionedhistoryinto the roots of the scandal, finally released last year, warned that “during the period 1950-1981, every single piece of immigration or citizenship legislation was designed at least in part to reduce the number of people with black or brown skin who were permitted to live and work in the UK”.“How can I claim compensation when they haven’t admitted that the legislation was wrong?” Lee said.“I don’t feel angry, I’m past the stage where I can feel angry. I’m very philosophical and thoughtful about all that’s happened. But I do feel deep regret that the UK government conspired to take away the rights of the Windrush generation.”Clive Foster, who was appointed as the new Windrushcommissionerin July, said he wanted the government to do more to “proactively identify and reach individuals” still stranded abroad. The problem stretches “far beyond the Caribbean, affecting communities across Africa, Asia, and the wider Commonwealth. Yet people from these communities, in the UK and overseas, may be unaware that the injustices they’ve suffered are directly linked to this scandal.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are doing our best to ensure that justice and compensation for victims is delivered as quickly as possible. Some cases are more complex than others, but we will always try to work with each individual to get them the support they need.”Explore more on these topicsWindrush scandalImmigration and asylumCommonwealth immigrationRaceHome OfficeLondonPolandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Where is it heading and can stargazers see it?Supported byAbout this contentPetra StockMon 18 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 20.05 EDTShareAn object that came from outside our solar system is hurtling towards the sun at roughly 61km (38 miles) a second.First detected in July, this visitor from outer space – known as 3I/Atlas – is only the third known interstellar object to have been observed, after ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019.Excitement has been growing since the Hubble space telescope captured an image of the interstellar interloper, offering scientists a rare opportunity to analyse its size and chemical makeup.“We’ve never had an object like this to study before,” says Dr Rebecca Allen, co-director of Swinburne’sSpaceTechnology and Industry Institute.What exactly is 3I/Atlas?“We don’t know exactly where it came from, but it definitely came from outside the solar system,” says Dr Laura Driessen, a radio astronomer at the University of Sydney.The name comes from “i” for interstellar, “3” as the third such object detected, and Atlas for the network of telescopes that identified it, called the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.While some have speculated about an alien incursion, scientists say 3I/Atlas is probably a comet. You mayremember the speculation over ’Oumuamua, which astronomers checked for radio signals in case it was an alien craft. It wasn’t.“There’s no evidence to point towards [3I/Atlas] being anything other than a really fun space rock that came from outside the solar system,” Driessen says. “Which, to be honest, is cool enough.”Why are scientists excited about the interstellar object?In the Hubble image, 3I/Atlas looks a bit like a “fuzzy snowball”, Allen says. Its hazy appearance is due to its “coma”, which is formed as the comet’s surface is heated by the sun,releasing dust and gas, and there are signs of a comet tail.Those chemical signatures – of elements and molecules from outside our solar system – will become more visible the closer it gets to the sun, Allen says.“We can use a tool called spectroscopy, and we can use light to actually understand exactly what that material is. Does this comet represent a solar system that had very similar conditions to our own, or is it something completely different?”Researchers have already used the Hubble image toestimate the diameterof 3I/Atlas to be less than 5.6km, and potentially as small as 320 metres.Where is 3I/Atlas heading?The space object is travelling at more than 200,000km/h, Allen says.“It’s going to kind of cruise through the inner solar system – in between Mars and Earth’s orbit – and then it will fly past the sun.“This one is on what we call a hyperbolic orbit. So it’s not gravitationally bound to the sun. It’s travelling much too fast, and so it will just fly out the other side of the solar system.”Its interstellar origins make 3I/Atlas different from other comets that orbit within the solar system, such as Halley’s comet, says Con Stoitsis, the comet and meteor director at the Astronomical Society of Victoria.Deep impact: touring central Australia’s cosmic cratersRead moreIt is expected to make its closest approach to the sun between October and December – coming within about 210m kilometres – and then continue its journey into space.According to Nasa, the closest 3I/Atlas will come to Earth is about 270m kilometres.“We’re not really sure where it’s going to end up until it comes around from the other side of the sun, and starts heading out to the outer solar system again,” Stoitsis says.Can we see the comet?While faint at the moment, the comet is expected to brighten as it approaches the sun, eventually bringing it “within reach of most large amateur telescopes”, Stoitsis says.Even then, 3I/Atlas will probably appear like a smudge, he says.“We get bright-ish comets, three or four times a year, which are visible with small telescopes and binoculars. This is definitely not one of those,” he says. “Unless you’ve got a decent-sized telescope, you won’t see it.”Explore more on these topicsSpaceAustralian climate and environment in focusAstronomyAsteroidsCometsexplainersShareReuse this content"

Anything else?No, not really.Oh.Well, Jaws is pretty good. I’ve seenit dozens of times.Jeffrey Voorhees will be pleased to hear that.Why?Because, despite his very small role as shark victim Alex Kintner when he was 12, Voorhees is still being paid residuals – royalties – 50 years later. Every timeJawsis on TV, he earns money.Nice work if you can get it.“It pays to die,” is how he put it in a recent interview with Syfy.Even so, he can’t be pulling in that much after all this time.It’s not just residuals. After hiding from fame for years, Voorhees – who still lives on Martha’s Vineyard, where Jaws was filmed – has found ways to embrace the full earning capacity of his brief turn as victim number two.How?By attending fan conventions for “£10,000 a time”, selling autographed merch online and making personalised videos on Cameo.People pay him for that?It helps that Jaws fans are a little obsessive. One woman brought Voorhees an inflatable yellow raft identical to the one on which Alex Kintner met his demise. “She was in tears and I signed the raft for her,” he said.Thatsounds more than a little obsessive.He’s even been presented with his old discarded royalty statements – bought by fans on eBay for thousands – to sign. “I don’t throw them away any more,” he said.Are there any other child actors still raking it in after all these years?Yes, if not to the same extent. Jason Weaver, who provided the singing voice for young Simba in the original animated version of The Lion King, reportedly received, and still receives, far more than the $2m (£1.5m) upfront Disney originally offered him before his mother insisted on a reduced fee plus royalties from soundtrack sales.Well done, Jason’s mum. Are there any more actors with cameos asbrief as Voorhees’?Casey Margolis, who fleetingly played a young version of Jonah Hill’s character in the 2007 filmSuperbad, recently revealed he’s still getting cheques.The kid whodraws penises on everything?That’s him. While the amounts vary from $10,000 to 12 cents, he reckons he’scollected about $100k(£74,000) in total.What a racket! How can I get my kid killed in something huge?Actually, that ship has probably sailed. Streaming services don’t tend to pay residuals in the same way, as their content is always available to watch – and young actors have reportedreceiving minuscule amountsfor their work.Do say:“These eye-watering sums are a symptom of how out of control fan culture has become.”Don’t say:“You’re gonna need a bigger bank account.”Explore more on these topicsJawsPass notesSuperbadfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But this film feels increasingly disingenuous, like a race to get to the ‘good’ stuff … the criminal investigation sparked by his deathLucy ManganMon 18 Aug 2025 17.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareThere is a reason the sitcomFriendswas so popular from the off and became such a juggernaut so quickly. The writing was brilliant, and the six actors in it were astonishing individually and even better together. Comedy is alchemical, and they transmuted gold into pure joy.Matthew Perry formed one sixth of the troupe as Chandler Bing. Every actor had their particular strength and his was perhaps to be the nimblest, the most alive to the currents crisscrossing any scene he was in. He was the only one of the cast allowed in the writers’ room to contribute, and from that maybe we can infer he was the most naturally funny off set too. Certainly his timing, even in the extraordinary company he kept, was immaculate.‘Ketamine queen’ accused of selling Matthew Perry fatal dose to plead guiltyRead moreAnd now we know that the rumours of addiction that plagued him during the filming and broadcast of later seasons were true. As he put it in the autobiography he published in 2022,Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, when Chandler was overweight, Perry was on the booze; when he was skinny, it was pills. But it was almost always something. A year after the book came out, Perry, 54, was found dead – drowned in his pool after suffering the acute effects of ketamine use.Matthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy, an hour-long documentary imported from the US by ITV, covers this sad story much as you might expect. There is footage from Friends’ glory days, plus telling footage of the battery of paparazzi yelling for his attention every time he stepped out in public. There are clips of interviews with his castmates lauding his talents back in the day, and grief-stricken ones from his great friend Hank Azaria and others after his death. Azaria is on the verge of tears as he remembers how Perry would floor his friends with laughter when he was healthy, and how so many of those who loved him felt they had lost him years before to his demons.Morgan Fairchild, who played Chandler’s mother Nora Tyler Bing in Friends.Photograph: ITVThere are excerpts from the audio version of his book read by Perry himself, which supply glimpses of his inner torment and memories of the aspects of his childhood to which he attributes his vulnerability to addiction; and portions of interviews where you see his charm and some of his pain. There is not much of his work in Friends on display, but such was – and remains – the pervasiveness of the show that perhaps it wasn’t felt necessary to remind us. Morgan Fairchild, who played Chandler’s mother in the series, contributes some nice and not excessively saccharine memories of him as an actor and of the difficulty in making a difference to someone who is not yet ready to deal with his problems.Doctor pleads guilty to giving Matthew Perry ketamine leading up to his deathRead moreStill, it feels like the background is being skimped to get to the “good” stuff: the criminal investigation sparked by his death and the recent charges brought against five people for supplying the ketamine that led to Perry’s death. Again, this is covered much as you might expect. Talking heads from the world of entertainment journalism are interwoven with accounts from retired LAPD officers explaining how police procedures work, and the district attorney in charge of the case is on hand in the sharpest of suits to explain how they discovered – and you’re hardly going to believe this, I know – a network of suppliers in Los Angeles that were able to get a celebrity as much of his chosen narcotic as he asked for, often at inflated prices. One of the doctors allegedly involved in the chain messages another: “I wonder how much this moron will pay … Let’s find out.” The headshaking at this lack of respect between a man and his cash cow becomes almost comical.Amid the accumulating disingenuousness, the documentary does have the grace to include the name of Cody McLaury, whose death has also been attributed to ketamine supposedly supplied by one of the five suspects in Perry’s case, and to include a comment from one of the contributors that it was surely largely because of Perry’s fame that a criminal investigation was launched into the actor’s death at all.The film ends, however, with unexpected delicacy, closing with the shot of a card left with flowers at his home by one of Perry’s many fans. “Thank you for making me laugh,” it says. “I’m glad Chandler got the happy ending you deserved.” A grace note Perry surely earned.Matthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy aired on ITV1 and is on ITVX now. In the US, it is available to stream on Peacock.Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryTV reviewTelevisionFriendsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But someone fired a flare gun into the ceiling and – whoosh! The whole building went up in flames’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 18 Aug 2025 08.54 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareRoger Glover, bass, songwriterWe wanted a more exciting sound than we had been getting in conventional recording studios, so hired the Rolling Stones’ mobile studio for three weeks to record in the Montreux casino. It was 1971 and the night before we were due to begin, we went to see Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention play in the casino as part of the Montreux jazz festival, but – as the song puts it – “some stupid with a flare gun” fired into the ceiling.Sparks came down and everyone had to get out. I became separated from the band so went back inside to find them. The place was empty, but just as I came out something exploded and whoosh – the whole building went up in flames.We sat in the bar of our hotel a couple of blocks away and watched the plume of black smoke as the beautiful old casino was reduced to charred wood. A couple of mornings later I was aware that I’d said the phrase “smoke on the water” loudly into the room as I woke up. Later, after guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had come up with a mid-tempo riff, I suggested Smoke on the Water as the title of a song about what had happened to us.The last time we were in Montreux, there were signs by the lake reading: 'No smoking on the water'There’s a great photograph of singer Ian Gillan with his notebook open and the first two verses written. I’m sat opposite him listening to Ritchie’s guitar through headphones. Ian and I were throwing lyrical ideas to each other and we had the song within maybe 15 minutes. It came out as if we were writing in a journal, beginning: “We all came out to Montreux, on the Lake Geneva shoreline”. “Funky Claude” is Claude Nobs, the jazz festival founder, a lovely man who was running round “pulling kids out” as his world went up in flames.Montreux has always been special to us because of what happened. The last time we were there, signs by the lake read “No smoking on the water” and four jets released smoke over the water as we played. That felt very emotional, but I never get tired of playing the song. Someone once said it’s like having a button that you press to make the audience go nuts.Ian Paice, drums, songwriterBefore it had any lyrics, Smoke on the Water was known as “the der-der-der song” because of Ritchie’s riff. After the casino burned down, Claude found us a place called the Pavillon ballroom, where we started playing around with it. Jon Lord doubled up the riff on organ, but with inversions to the chords. Roger’s bass playing was really solid and that gave me room to flash around, so the drums build up in a crescendo. We had just started recording when there were flashing lights outside and the police arrived. The roadies managed to hold the doors shut until we’d finished the take. Then a police officer said: “You must stop! You are too loud!”Claude suggested we continue at the closed Grand Hotel, by which time Ritchie decided he didn’t want the slow song When a Blind Man Cries on the Machine Head album. That left us a track short, but our engineerMartin Birchreminded us of “that first thing we did in the Pavillon”. Once Ian Gillan and Roger started telling the story in the lyrics, it started to become Smoke on the Water.We finished recording it on the ground floor corridor of the hotel, having raided the rooms and used mattresses to block any sound leaking, hence the line “a few red lights and a few old beds”. At that point it was just another album track. We had no idea it would become really important, but the public decide those things.Warner Bros in Los Angeles loved it but said it was too long for the radio, so unbeknown to us one of their engineers cut it down to four minutes. The rest is history, as they say. On the Made in Japan live version we’d been playing it for a year and had found all these little nooks and crannies to explore, so it’s different. The audience did the hand claps in time with the riff. Ian had trouble hearing through the monitors that night in Osaka so at the end he says that wonderful line: “I want everything louder than everything else!” A good 40 years after we recorded it, I was playing with one of my little pickup bands in a restaurant in Italy and someone said the chef wanted to say hello. He came up to me and said: “I was the chef in the casino when it burned down.”Deep Purple’s Made in Japan (50th Anniversary Edition) is out nowExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madeMetalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When I let go of that dream, it taught me that being myself was enoughNicola SlawsonMon 18 Aug 2025 06.00 EDTShareFor years I had coveted having an allotment. I pictured myself being practical and resourceful, growing vegetables and cycling home with them in my wicker basket. I imagined pickling produce like my grandmother had done and becoming outdoorsy and calm – not the hot mess I usually felt. An allotment, I believed, would make me a better person with a better life.In London it felt impossible, but when I moved back to Shrewsbury during the pandemic, I finally got one. Newly diagnosed with ADHD, I became hyperfocused on my new hobby. But beneath the enthusiasm, I was struggling to keep on top of everything that needed to be done. I found it hard to motivate myself to do the mundane tasks, such as digging up weeds, and was frustrated by all the pests that ruined my efforts. Harvesting overwhelmed me: everything was ready at once and often went to waste.View image in fullscreen‘I’m someone who can’t even keep houseplants alive – and that’s OK’…Nicola Slawson.Photograph: Lisa WebbThe following year, I got pregnant and experienced bad morning sickness. The plot became even wilder than the year before: bindweed took over. Even though I was struggling, pregnancy only made the dream feel more important. I envisaged being an earth mother who wore her baby in a sling while picking vegetables for dinner.Instead, the plot quickly turned into a source of stress. It got worse when the baby arrived and I was too tired to do much. Bringing her was sometimes lovely, but often she screamed to be held – and you can’t get much done holding a baby, sling or not. I felt frustrated. I saw other young families do it, so why couldn’t I cope? I trudged on, but a year into motherhood, I finally gave up my plot. After a warning from the allotment society telling me I needed to tidy it up or I’d lose it, I vowed to make a final push but soon admitted defeat and decided to bow out.View image in fullscreenNicola Slawson with her daughter.Photograph: Rachel SlawsonAt first, I was heartbroken, but I realised I wasn’t upset about the plot – but about the fact that I wasn’t who I thought I was. Having an allotment was tied up with my identity. I’d wanted so badly to be a different kind of person – one of those serene wellness types I saw on Instagram, effortlessly cooking their homegrown veg in immaculate kitchens.Losing the allotment meant letting go of that fantasy but it also meant I was released from the constant shame that came with not living up to it. In reality, I’m someone who can’t even keep houseplants alive and that’s OK.Allotmentsare an important part of a community, but we can’t all be Monty Don.It felt so freeing to give up the idea that I had to be someone else to be a good mum and to finally be OK with who I really am. Since then I’ve been so much gentler with myself. I also have more time, more headspace and I no longer feel guilty for not using my spare time to be “productive”. I allow myself to sit on the sofa and enjoy a cuppa, and I’ve started reading fiction again. I’ve also spent more time in my much-neglected back garden, chasing my daughter around.In a culture obsessed with overachieving and self-improvement, and which celebrates seemingly perfect mothers, I found self-acceptance in my messy life, my imperfect approach to parenthood – and the fact my fingers most certainly aren’t green.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As the name implies, and her intro (“Ladies, and hopefully not too many gentlemen …”) confirms, it’s not made with the likes of me in mind. But there’s still plenty to enjoy for sheepish men in the crowd, as the 25-year-old shares not very fond memories of life at an all-girls private Catholic school on the other side of the Irish Sea.At least initially, it’s no great sob story, and not only because Galvo openly admits (and sends up) how pampered and privileged a childhood she had. But the religious education she depicts can still raise eyebrows, even if Galvo’s account of it (fetishising Jesus, or observing that the Bible’s only templates for femininity are “a virgin and a prostitute”) feels well-worn. It’s less the superstition that shocks you than the sexism, as Galvo, like her schoolmates, is prepped to become – in her words – “the highly educated stay-at-home wife of a rugby player”.Jena Friedman: Motherf*cker review – political zingers and all-too-raw griefRead moreIt’s the tyranny she experiences too at the hands of girls better educated about menstrual health than young Rachel was – cue one arresting anecdote about a misapplied tampon and an uncomfortable swim in the Atlantic. Another highlight finds our host demonstrating the winsome giggle women perform for men’s benefit, so distant from the incontinent cackles reserved for one another.As Galvo’s teenage years unfold, we see this show-pony of a tween simultaneously grow up and shrink, bullied into submission for her weight and her weirdness. It’s no surprise then that she might use The Shite Feminist to settle some scores – even if the show overdoes the gender essentialism in its stereotype of needy, inadequate men requiring their women to be weak and demure. If its transition is clunky, finally, from the story of Galvo’s God-fearing, all-female education (its relation to feminism implicit at best) to her fretting about feminist principle and practice in the final act, this remains a show with a likable swagger.At Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

She lived in the El Poble-sec area of Barcelona – it translates from Catalan as “the dry village” – where she cared for her 85-year-old mother and sang in a local choir.

The temperature that day had reached more than 35C, which left workers like her exposed: Spain has a clearer system of regulations covering heat and work than a lot of other countries, but it is still full of gaps.That afternoon, Aguilar had sent a friend a WhatsApp message: “Sorry for not answering sooner, it’s just been a really bad afternoon. Not just because of the shit [ie the rubbish], but I thought I was going to die. I’m getting pains in my arms, chest and neck, cramps.” She also seems to have told one of her managers about how awful she was feeling. When she returned home, she collapsed and hit her head. Attempts by paramedics to revive her were unsuccessful.The reaction to Aguilar’s death has been furious. On 16 July, people marched behind banners that read: “Extreme heat is also workplace violence”. Street cleaners demanded better summer workwear and more breaks. They claimed that some of the most crucial new rules announced by local politicians and officials – supposedly to ensure that outdoor workers had breathable uniforms – had not been put into practice. By then, Aguilar’s family was readyinglegal action: if her autopsy showed she had died of heatstroke, her relatives said they would sue Aguilar’s employers and the city council.After days of searing heat in the UK, it is not hard to imagine a version of this story happening in this country – and to see that, at the intersection ofwork and the climate crisis, there is already a huge tangle of increasingly urgent issues. As temperatures in this corner of northern Europe once again scrape the mid-30s, what must it be like to work in warehouses and factories with precious little ventilation, let alone air conditioning? How do builders and bike couriers cope? And what are working lives like in parts of the economy from which people completely avert their eyes?In the heatwave that hit us a month ago, I was in Exmoor, where I saw a pizzeria tell its customers that for the sake of their kitchen staff, they had no choice but to temporarily shut. But as people were turned away, I kept thinking of thedark kitchensthat supply many of the food-delivery companies concentrated in our cities: tiny workplaces baldly described in a report by the Royal Society for Public Health as “small boxes” where food is produced in a “dark, cramped and low paid environment which is frequently either too hot or too cold”.Whereas European countries such as Belgium, Hungary and Slovenia have working regulations built aroundclear temperature limits, what passes for this country’s system of rules and regulations on work and heat is a very British mess of half-measures and mere recommendations. For those working indoors,official guidancesuggests a minimum temperature of 16C, which falls to 13C if people are doing “physical work”. But neither hardened legislation nor small-print guidance specifies any maximum temperatures – nor, indeed, many comprehensive rules that cover people who work in the open air.Health and safety legislation and industry-specific regulations offer some protection to workers outdoors in such trades as construction and railway maintenance. But there is an awful sense of the severity of extreme weather finding no reflection in the law.From around the world, there is an ongoing torrent of stories highlighting tensions and problems that can easily be copied across to the working lives of people in any number of other countries. In South Korea, construction workers point out that as the air reaches 35C, concrete and asphalt intensify the heat even further, andtell journalists: “In a summer like this, we think every day that we may die.” In northern India, the city of Varanasi has recently seen dozens of delivery workerscut adriftby the companies they work for, after they took part in protests demanding heat safety measures. In stories such as these, there are glimmers of demands that will soon become globally inescapable – not just for drastically altered conditions, but radically different ways of living.Spanish people know deadly heatwaves are now an annual event. So why are our politicians in denial? | María RamírezRead moreIn the UK, there are signs of deepening political tensions that another hot summer could make explosive. Before last year’s election,Labour acknowledgedthat “in a number of sectors, working temperatures are regularly unacceptably high” and said it would commit to “modernising health and safety guidance with reference to extreme temperatures”. As part of her plans to upgrade workplace rights, Angela Raynerrepeated the last pledgeonce her party was in government. The Health and Safety Executive is now working on measures that would allow workers to insist on new protections from heat, and make it obligatory for employers to carry out “heat stress assessments”.Quite rightly, the trade unions want more. For the past few years, the TUC – supported by its big member organisations – has been pushing for acut-off temperaturein indoor workplaces of 30C, or 27C if people are doing strenuous jobs. It also demands much more flexible working, and outdoor shifts that sit either side of the middle of the day. But the signals from Whitehall seem maddeningly hesitant. Perhaps because of the government’s belief in sweeping away regulation and reducing red tape, its spokespeople insist there are “no plans to introduce a maximum workplace temperature”, while ministersbat away callsfor legislation that would allow British workers to be sent home during extreme heat.What is really striking is how awkwardly searing heat sits with views of work that are common across the political establishment. Human frailty, we are told, must be no barrier to getting a job. As evidenced by new rumblings about the pension agebeing raised to 68, the same logic is being applied to people in what used to be considered old age – which is precisely when sensitivity to heat can become fatal. This is an aspect of climate denial that is still completely overlooked, crystallised in glaring contrasts: between the wilting parcel-deliverer or ageing supermarket worker stoically pushing shopping trolleys across baking asphalt, and the politicians still failing to look ahead to a recalibration of work that will surely become inevitable much sooner than they think. As labour becomes ever more a matter of life and death, how could it be otherwise?John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsExtreme heatOpinionWorkers' rightsClimate crisisWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

Is this progress?Mon 18 Aug 2025 07.38 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShareRemember the international outrage over alurid incidentinvolving a female dance critic, a male choreographer and a deposit of his pet dachshund’s excrement? In February 2023 the German choreographer Marco Goecke cornered Wiebke Hüster in the foyer of the Hanover State Opera during the interval of a show. Goecke, who was then artistic director of the venue, brought out a bag of dog poo from his pocket and pushed it into the journalist’s face. The reason? Hüster had written a negative review of his Netherlands-based show, In the Dutch Mountains, which had appeared in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Faz) on the night of hishundekotattack.The incident sparked column inches of conversation in Germany on critical culture, with a ripple effect further afield: in the Netherlands, theatre criticscondemned itas an act of violence against freedom of expression; in the US, the American Theatre Critics Association did the same, with a blaze of accompanying newspaper headlines across Europe.Goeckelost his joband became a professional persona non grata. Good, I thought, as a critic who has been approached by some angry men myself in theatre auditoriums, though never with this level of repellently visceral aggression. The reaction was indubitable proof of the culture industry’s zero tolerance towards assault in Germany, right? Especially in a case involving a man attacking a woman in this publicly shaming way.Wrong. In May 2024, Goecke was appointed ballet director at Theater Basel for the upcoming 2025-26 season. He had remainedin the doghousefor just over a year despite all the hand-wringing in Germany. What does this say about the position of critics in general, and female reviewers in particular, given the misogynistic undertones in Goecke’s act, which seemed like a calculated aim to humiliate and degrade?Reflecting onthe episode in a newBBC Radio 4 documentaryabout the state of culture criticism in our fast-changing world of AI, algorithms and influencer-critics, Hüster spoke to me about her lack of surprise at Goecke’s rehabilitation. She had always assumed he would find work again. From a highly experienced critic who has been on the scene for several decades, what doesthatsay about gender dynamics in the arts? Shockingly, in the moments after the attack she felt grateful it had not been worse, despite her sense of violation. “I thought: ‘It’s bad – but it’s not a knife in your ribs,’” she said, and went on to describe the hate burning off her attacker, as if he bore an “absolute sincere wish to do me real harm”.Hüster’s vocabulary couldn’t sound more gendered, with Goecke’s behaviour akin to that of a stalker, not an artistic director. She herself puts the intensity of his reaction partly down to the fact that she was awomandoing a critical takedown – in one of Europe’s most influential papers. But inGermanyshe is far from the only female critic in the field. A Berlin theatre critic tells me there are far more female culture reviewers now than was previously the case. Hüster has seen this change too. The trend appears the same for UK criticism.And yet I fear that the optics of gender parity – or at least progress – are deceptive when set against the cold, hard facts. Asurvey conducted in 2019by the five-year Women in Theatre research project, whose partners include the Writers’ Guild, WOW (Women of the World) and Equity, among others, found that only 10% of the reviewing corps for drama were female. Subsequent reports in 2021and 2023corroborated this finding.This figure surprises and dismays me. It goes against the often-assumed pace of progress. So much so that Arts Council England’s national council governing body has just approved ayear-long taskforceto investigate the underrepresentation of and discrimination against women in the arts as a result of the Women in Theatre research project.Punched, insulted and excoriated in song … our critics on the artists who hit backRead moreAre we going backwards? Putting Hüster’s appalling experience aside, you could argue that the clashes between artists and critics nowadays are not half as fractious as they were a few decades ago, when criticism really was a macho sport with full-out eruptions of physical violence. This newspaper’s Michael Billington wasat the receiving endof a blow himself. That this no longer happens is a sign of progress, isn’t it? Well, it’s about optics again, because the punches are now thrown on social media, and so often, as findings reveal time and again, women are subjected to more vociferous attacks and pile-ons than their male counterparts.There were murmurs from some corners that Hüster’s review was unnecessarily harsh. I wonder if this judgment was cast because female critics are held to a different standard, however unconsciously – and whether we are expected to be less combative, more balanced? Hüster concedes that her review came with colourful language and humour. So what? It is just this kind of combative spirit that was espoused by William Blake in his idea that “opposition is true friendship”, that is, learning that occurs in the rich tension sparked between opposite viewpoints.Hüster also spoke to me of adhering to her own boundaries, never venturing into commentary that was personal or related to appearance. I hope male writers or directors havetheirboundaries too, especially if they approach a female critic to contest a review in person. I have had this several times, and have felt threatened by it. It’s a lonely job, as Hüster pointed out to me (and all the more so for the 10% of UK-based theatre critics who are female), but it really shouldn’t be a dangerous one.Where does all of this leave the female critic? Where Hüster is, I suppose. Whatever the implications of Goecke’s comeback, it is business as usual for her. “I have not changed because of that incident,” she said. “No, that would be awful.” Indeed.Arifa Akbar is the Guardian’s chief theatre critic.

Peter Hain was Labour MP for Neath and now sits in the House of LordsMon 18 Aug 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareIs terrorism really a vicar with a peaceful placard?As parliamentarians who are passionate about democracy and civil liberties, we know that both are under threat. A growing number of organisations encourage violence and intimidation in pursuit of political aims. MPs are besieged with threats, advised not to hold in-person surgeries and are grieving still fortwo colleagues killedin the past 10 years. Anti-migrant protests and threats are encouraged by the far right to take place across the country. Yet attempts to address all this are increasingly destabilising public confidence in politics, emboldening those who fan the flames of hatred by claiming a “two-tier” response. Without change, the danger that someone will get hurt – or killed again – will only grow.Driven by both homegrown and overseas extremism, and social media algorithms, there is a growing trend for direct action to end in physical harm or destruction in order to get noticed. Proscription is the primary tool open to governments to put a hard stop to this, but withnearly 100 organisationsand hundreds more Britons now labelled “terrorists” in recent weeks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain parity between the organisations proscribed within the public mind. For any law to be effective, it has to be workable and legitimate. For it to defend democracy, it must also not be designed – or be seen to be designed – to spare ministers the difficulties of dealing with dissent. Proscription puts the person peacefully expressing opposition into the same category as the person planting a bomb or shooting a bullet.We came down on different sides inlast month’s voteon whether to proscribe Palestine Action, and neither of us have ever supported the group. But we both agree what is happening now neither protects protest nor makes protest policeable.We have three shared convictions. First, no one – including elected politicians and the police – should face violent threats or intimidation for doing the job that we ask of them, even if we disagree with how they do it. Second, everyone should be able to protest and engage in non-violent disruption without being lumped in with Islamic State, al-Qaida or the IRA. Third, legislation to uphold our civil rights and to stop intimidation should be cause-blind: protecting those whom we wish to beat at the ballot box by enabling all citizens to be heard and parliamentarians to do our jobs.How, then, should the government respond? First and foremost with common sense. Urgent police guidance should be issued to head off the car crash that proscription enforcement is rapidly becoming, by setting out a test of proportionality for any interventions. Proscribing the original Palestine Action group was said to be about stopping those inciting direct harm and violence. Going after people with a poster testing the boundaries of liberty – some who may or may not even support Palestine Action but feel strongly about Palestinian rights – confuses rather than clarifies the government’s intention. People must be able to protest about the horror in Gaza, and the focus should be on what is happening in Palestine, not in Parliament Square.The government should be much more transparent about how it is upholding our constitutional rights. There is no free speech if one half of a political debate lives in fear of being targeted for disagreeing. We need mechanisms to stop those who use violence, threaten migrants or hound women instead of raising their voices to achieve their goals. Lord David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, argued that proscription should always be a time-limited process – and we agree. It should also be targeted at real terrorists whose explicit intention is to kill innocent civilians.No democratic state should make arbitrary decisions and must actively seek the consent of citizens. As it stands, how proscription is achieved – short parliamentary debates in both houses and, in the case of Palestine Action, bracketing the organisation along with two far-right groups in a single vote – fails this test. To have the ability to proscribe a group as “terrorists”, ministers and government must do much more to show the public how and why that is the case.‘I’m proud to have made this stand’: over-60s arrested at Palestine Action ban protest explain their decisionRead moreWe must also address the glaring inconsistencies and real gaps in law these cases reveal. Legislation on public order focuses on specific practices; proscription orders target specific terrorist groups. Nothing sits between this to recognise when organisations themselves encourage members repeatedly and deliberately to escalate intimidation in pursuit of their aim. Extreme groups create a climate of violence, leaving refugees waiting to be firebombed, Jewish citizens attacked, black and Muslim citizens living in fear, and women increasingly vilified.Getting the balance right means abolishing offences such as “recklessly encouraging support” of a proscribed group and focusing instead on those who organise this criminality. Setting out how and when behaviour threatens our democracy – as distinct from criticising state policies – would also better maintain the integrity of the seriousness of terrorism charges. Stopping organisations that are not simply accidentally violent, but intentionally so, means a new offence is needed, distinct from the battery of existing criminal ones. This would recognise how groups that encourage violence and intimidation go beyond existing public order offences, disentangling non-violent direct action from violence or attacks on property and terrorism.The alternative – accepting that harm to individuals is an inevitable risk of protest because people feel strongly about something – is not tenable. Terrorism is different from terrifying opponents, but both are or should be criminal offences. The failure to make that distinction is both increasingly infecting the policing of protest and undermining the legitimate right to protest.Anyone who thinks this situation is simple – either an egregiously authoritarian power-grab from the government or a sincere intention to block violent thuggery – isn’t paying attention. The status quo has come to mean equating peaceful witness with terrorism, and isn’t sustainable. But neither is pretending there isn’t a problem that threatens our ability to debate, disagree and ultimately decide in our democracy. Without action, it will be those with the loudest voices and the most lethal actors who win.Stella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for Walthamstow.

But little is said about the calibre of Palestinian journalismMon 18 Aug 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 03.08 EDTShareThe first time I met Al Jazeera’s Gaza team lead, Tamer Almisshal,was in July last year. His team had alreadyburied two journalists, Hamza al-Dahdouh and Samer Abu Daqqa. The rest, he told me, were hungry. They were also dealing with trying to get hold of protective gear, threats from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the killing of family members.Ismail al-Ghoulhadn’t seen his wife and child in months and was missing them intensely.Hossam Shabat,Mohammed QraiqeaandAnas al-Sharifwere asking for time to secure food in the morning before they could start reporting. Today, they are all dead.I spoke with various members of the Gaza teamwhile writinga profile of Gaza’s veteran reporterWael al-Dahdouh, who lost his wife, three of his children and grandson. All spoke of their work as a duty that needed to be carried out despite the risks. Three members of that team have since been killed in a chain of assassinations. Each time I sent condolences, the response was always that the coverage would not cease. “We are continuing,” the Gaza editor told me last week, after he lost his entire Gaza City team in the targeted strike that claimed the lives of Sharif, Mohammed Nofal, Ibrahim Thaher and Qraiqea. “We will not betray their message, or their last wishes.”As these killings dazed the world – and the response to them became mired in unproven and in some casesrisibly implausible claimsthat some of these journalists were militants – little has been said about the calibre of journalism in Gaza. How fluent, articulate and poised its journalists are under impossible circumstances. How much they manage to capture horrific events and pain on a daily basis, in a journalistic Arabic that they have perfected to an art, while maintaining a professional, collected presence on camera. How much they manage to keep their cool. I struggled often to translate their words into English, so rich and expansive is their expression. Even Sharif’sfinal message, a text for the ages, loses some of its power in translation. In it, he addresses those who “choked” our breath, but the word he uses is closer to “besieged” – evoking not just physical asphyxiation but the silencing of a surveilled people’s voice.What strikes me when I speak with journalists in and from Gaza is how evangelical and heartbreakingly idealistic they are; how much journalism to them was a duty even if it meant certain death. All who have been killed had a choice, and those who are still alive and reporting still do. Sharif said he had beenthreatened several timesby Israeli authorities over the past two years. Al Jazeera told me that he was sent a warning by Israeli intelligence and told to stop reporting. When he refused, his father waskilled in an airstrike. When Ghoul took over from Dahdouh early last year, Dahdouh told him that it was a dangerous job, and no one would fault him for leaving his post and returning to his wife and child. Ghoul refused, and wasdecapitated in a targeted strike.What the Israeli government is trying to do with these killings is not just stop the stream of damning reports and footage, but annihilate the very image of Palestinians that these media professionals convey. The credibility, dignity and talent that Gaza’s journalists exhibit to the world in their reports and social media posts has to be extinguished. The more Gaza is a place that is teeming with militants, where there are no reliable narrators, and where Israel’s justifications for killing and starvation cannot be challenged by plausible witnesses, the easierIsraelcan prosecute its genocidal campaign.1:22Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif among five journalists killed by Israel in Gaza – videoA recent investigation by +972 Magazine and Local Call identified thesinisterly named “legitimisation cell”, a unit of the Israeli military tasked, in the words of the report, with “identifying Gaza-based journalists it could portray as undercover Hamas operatives, in an effort to blunt growing global outrage over Israel’s killing of reporters”. According to the investigation’s sources, the effort is “driven by anger that Gaza-based reporters were ‘smearing [Israel’s] name in front of the world’”.Central to this effort is Israel’s ability to rely on western media to treat its claims as somehow plausible, despite the fact that time and time again, it has made claims that turn out not to be true. Emergency workers who were killed because they were “advancing suspiciously”, according to the IDF, were said to befound in restraintswith execution-style shots. The claim that Hamas was systematically stealing aid, which is used to justify blockade and starvation, wascontradicted by sourceswithin the Israeli military itself.It is Hamas that is shooting Palestinians queueing for aid,Israel has said, not us.Eventually, this behaviour deserves to be called what it is: systemic deception that forfeits your right to be a credible authority. And still we are told that Israel has killed a journalist, buthere is Israel’s claimthat the journalist was a militant. You can make up your mind. The resulting ambiguity means that even if these claims cannot be verified, they are imbued with potential truth. Do you see how that works?On Gaza’s killing fields, journalism faces its darkest hour – but that won’t stop us reporting | Asef HamidiRead moreThe truth is that journalists inGazahave been colossally failed by many of their colleagues in the western media – not just in terms of how their killings are reported, but in how the entire conflict is described. Figures of the dead and starving in Gaza are often described as coming from “Hamas-run” ministries, but you don’t see the statements coming from Israeli authorities caveated as serially unreliable, or the phrase “wanted by the international criminal court” attached to the name Benjamin Netanyahu.Meanwhile, the word of Palestinian journalists is never quite enough – not until foreign media (who are not allowed into Gaza) can give the final gold-standard judgment. They are cast out of the body of journalism, their truth buried along with them.In Gaza, however, there will always be someone brave and clear-eyed who continues the coverage. Who puts on a press flak jacket that makes them a target. They continue to bear, alone, the responsibility of bringing the world the reality of events in Gaza, even as their voices and breaths are besieged.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

To be precise: “You can’t have a woman [as James Bond]. It just doesn’t work. James Bond has to be James Bond, otherwise it becomes something else.”Mirren is starring opposite Pierce Brosnan in the film adaptation of Richard Osman’s The Thursday Murder Club, in which they both play amateur sleuths in a care home. Happily, that is a unisex job. Brosnan might also describe himself as “such a feminist” – he has never said so explicitly, but in 2019, he said a female Bond would be “exhilarating”. However, he’s now back on team men, saying: “I’m so excited to see the next man come on the stage and to see a whole new exuberance and life for this character.” Exhilaration, excitement, exuberance: all qualities I don’t think I’ve ever seen in any Bond, across the great gamut of maleness, from Connery to Craig. But who am I to judge? Whenever 007 gets a new pen that can poison someone from 50 paces, the thrill racing through his veins might be implied by his slightly less stern visage. Truly, masculinity is an unknowable frontier.A couple of things, before we hand the franchise over toAmazon, who bought it for more than $1bn earlier this year. The essential qualities of Bond are as follows: he can kill on command without conscience, except when he has a conscience; he is patriotic; he is irresistible to women; he favours discreetly tailored, monochrome clothing; he can drink neat spirits without becoming intoxicated; and he always introduces himself in reverse order, to people who tend to already know his name. None of this screams “man”, except perhaps the patriotism, if you understand emotionally charged nationalism as a drumbeat of the patriarchy. Having said that, women can serve the patriarchy just as well as men – look at Mirren. Sorry, that is totally uncalled for: her feminist membership cannot be revoked, at least not on the basis of her Bond opinions, since that would be handing 007 too much power in the realm of gender.On a separate point: is Bond a feminist, and if he is, does that mean it’s fine for him to remain a man in perpetuity? It’s a tricky one. His value system has changed so much over the 25 films, from his early “lovable chauvinist” years to his late “anguished quester after the truth of the self” iteration, a lesser person than myself might think the masculine ideal had itself gone on a journey since it first put on a dinner jacket in 1962. That, however, is a fruitless line of analysis, since if we were to takeJames Bondas too literal a representation of the changing social expectations of men, we’d have to conclude that they can be any which way, so long as they’re prepared to take out a minor dictator with piano wire and have a disregard for due process.Arguably more important than any of that is what the Amazon takeover will do to the franchise, given the semi-recent history of the tech company – it invented an AI recruitment tool in 2018 thateffectively trained itself to prefer male candidates; it was shown to have embedded sexism in its sports coverage, afterAlexa didn’t know what a Lioness was; and, according to employees, it hasan office culture in which you’re never not at work, which automatically excludes sane people – and come on, a lot of those are going to be women. Does this sound like a safe pair of hands to take over the management of a fictional character whose arc we would hope is going to continue to bend towards gender justice? Not really, but at the same time, if Amazon did spring a female Bond on the world, and used that as feminist-washing, proof in perpetuity that none of the sexist algorithms were created deliberately, well, that would be quite annoying.Nobody overreact, but surely what this moment in history is crying out for is a gender-fluid Bond.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Clever design could reverse this unwelcome developmentCarlo Ratti is the director of Venice’s 2025 Biennale ArchitetturaMon 18 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareSomething is thinning in public space. Pavements are still crowded. Parks still bustle. But if you look more closely – or, better still, if you measure it – the texture of our interactions has changed.Together with colleagues at Yale, Harvard and other universities, we used AI to compare footage of public spaces from the 1970s with recent video in the same locations in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Thefindings are striking: people walk faster, linger less, and are less likely to meet up. That’s no surprise in a world where phones, Netflix and AI companions are luring us away from real-world spaces and real-world friends. Yet, if technology is part of the problem, it may also be part of the solution. By using AI to study urban public spaces, we can gather data, pick out patterns and test new designs that could help us rethink, for our time, our modern versions of the agora– the market and main public gathering place of Athens.The urban playground has always drawn curious minds. Among the sharpest was William “Holly” Whyte, who filmed plazas and parks in 1970sNew York. He was fascinated by where people chose to sit, how they navigated space, and what drew them together. His findings, documented in The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces (1980), were at times beautifully simple: “What attracts people most, it would appear, is other people.” From his footage, Whyte turned his observations into data-backed recommendations: he said seats should be “two human backsides deep” and sung the praises of movable chairs that let people chase sun or shade. His analysis helped save New York spaces such as Bryant Park and shaped our modern approach to people-centred design.Whyte’s experiments were revelatory, but hard to replicate. Why? Analysing the footage, frame by frame, took a team of assistants months. Now, finally, that challenge has been overcome, as we have invented non-human evaluators. Our team digitised Whyte’s original footage and compared it with recent videos – of Bryant Park, the steps of the Met Museum in New York, Boston’s Downtown Crossing, and Philadelphia’s Chestnut Street – collected by sociologist Keith Hampton. Then we trained an AI model to analyse the two sets of footage. AI allows self-driving cars to recognise bikes and pedestrians; that same technology excels at analysing footage of parks and plazas, and keeping track of hundreds of people at the same time. What took Whyte months now takes minutes.View image in fullscreenThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.Photograph: Batchelder/AlamySo how have cities changed between 1970 and 2010? As we discuss in a recent paper in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, walking speeds haveincreased by 15%. People stand still less often. Dyads – pairs meeting and then walking together – have declined. Downtown Crossing in Boston, once lively and social, has become a pass-through. Even in Manhattan’s Bryant Park – improved, according to Whyte’s vision – the number of social interactions has fallen. Cities have not emptied, but a part of their essence has thinned.Different forces have caused these changes. Work rhythms are accelerating and as time becomes more precious, we are less willing to spend it meandering. Perhaps people prefer Starbucks to the park. The iPhone was barely three years old in 2010, yet already we may have been pulled into our personalised data streams, abandoning the wandering gaze of the flâneur.That could be a disaster for our social fabric. Online, we drift into curated echo chambers, scrolling past discomfort and filtering out dissent. Public space, by contrast, remains gloriously unfiltered. It invites friction, messiness, surprise. A rival football fan holds the door for you. Your children play with children who speak different languages. If we spend less time in public space, we might lose tolerance for the wider public – and thus lose the habit of citizenship itself.Paradoxically, the same technologies pulling us inward might help bring us back out. Social media is addictive because algorithms are constantly testing out what we like. If we use AI to analyse outdoor public spaces, we can do the next best thing: give every park, plaza and street corner its own, personal William Whyte to test improvements there. What types of chairs and benches best promote interaction? Could adding greenery or water features create a more comfortable microclimate? Which public games might help break the ice? Temporary design interventions could be introduced, evaluated with AI, and iterated through a process of trial and error – evolving organically, much like nature itself.To this end, architects should not shy away from using new AI tools, as weargueat this year’s Biennale Architettura in Venice. But how?First, with humility. Public spaces of the past were far from perfect – often excluding women, minorities, and those with access needs. We should not romanticise them. Nor should we surrender to a technology-led present. Optimising public life through data alone risks repeating the mistakes of high modernism. AI can reveal patterns. It cannot dictate what is good.Second, with curiosity. Public space is not static. It is alive. It responds to heat, light, geometry, programme. Small interventions – a bench in shade, a water fountain on a hot day, a winding path instead of a shortcut – can transform behaviour. In a recent study in Milan, we found that compliance with 30km/h speed limits had less to do with signage and more to do with street geometry. What slows us down is not instruction but design.Climate change, too, plays a growing role. As temperatures rise across southern Europe, many urban spaces remain shaped by outdated climatic expectations. Sicily can now grow mangoes, yet its squares offer little protection from heat. We might learn from cities such as Singapore, where the orchestration of vegetation, water, and shading are used to actively mitigate heat. If Europe’s climate is changing then its public spaces must follow.The deeper challenge is this: for too long, designers have worked at a remove – imagining how people should behave from studios located far from the street. Today, we have tools to observe how people actually behave. To test hypotheses. To prototype joy and proximity. Yet these tools must be used not for optimisation but for stewardship.If we can use them wisely, we can counter the hollowing of public space. The agora isn’t dead. It just needs redesigning. And if we’re smart about it, AI might just help us get there. It may help us hear something else too: the fragile, elusive symphony of the commons.Carlo Ratti is professor at MIT and Politecnico di Milano, and director of Venice’s 2025 Biennale ArchitetturaExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionNew YorkDesigncommentShareReuse this content"

None of the participants knew they were going to take part two days ago. In recent decades, diplomacy has been increasingly conducted in ad hoc contact groups – but the group of seven countries (the US, Ukraine, the UK, Germany, Finland, Italy and France) and two international organisations (Nato and the EU) has never met in this way before.Officials will be preparing in the usual way, assembling briefing packs and writing talking points, aiming to please their bosses and, hopefully, allowing them to make the most effective intervention.They should take a deep breath and think differently. The precedents of European Councils and Nato summits – and evenDonald Trumpbilaterals – are misleading enough to be actively unhelpful. As former colleagues from Washington to Kyiv, via London, Paris, Brussels, Rome, Berlin and Helsinki, prep their principals, I urge them to discard the traditional approach.The usual format of each leader making a statement (however brief) just won’t cut it. There are three key groupings in the meeting – the US,Ukraineand Europe. Europe should have a single spokesperson. Most European participants might be prepared to concede to that approach, as long as their leader is the chosen one. But only two are really in the frame.The meeting will be conducted entirely in English with an interpreter forVolodymyr Zelenskyy. But there will be only two native English speakers, with Keir Starmer as the only European. Two others have spoken English for so long that they count as near-native speakers: Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, and Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte. Stubb represents the smallest participant, often an advantage when corralling bigger beasts, while Rutte represents Europe’s military alliance. The others speak well enough for most meetings but Trump’s quirkiness could wrong-foot them. Emmanuel Macron, Ursula von der Leyen, Friedrich Merz and Giorgia Meloni speak well enough to make any point they want to make, but not necessarily in the best way to make it. Trump takes offence easily.So, Rutte or Starmer should speak forEurope. Whoever speaks needs to make their points without notes, look Trump in the eye, be prepared to be interrupted but disciplined enough not to lose the thread – and to resume their presentation when the president has subsided.1:55'There’s no deal until there’s a deal,' says Trump on Ukraine war after talks with Putin – videoThe European message needs to build onthe Alaska summit. European publics and pundits have declared Vladimir Putin the winner, and poured scorn on Trump’s kowtowing and conspicuous lack of success; some politicians have joined in. Britons might think their government craven for seeing the meeting as the start of a promising initiative, but that’s really the only sensible diplomatic take.The most promising result of the Anchorage summit was Trump’s conclusion that aiming for a ceasefire was not good enough; we need to move smartly to a full agreement. The Europeans could signal their willingness to play a full part in implementing such an agreement. That role, above everything else, will be providing concrete security guarantees. Putin is highly likely to reject that.But what if the comprehensive agreement also had something important for him? Putin’s two key territorial requirements are the land bridge to Crimea and the whole of Donbas. He has the first but not the second.Ukraine would hate giving up land thatRussiahas never conquered. But the aim here is peace, and peace always requires concessions. Ukraine has,of course, a great interest in ending the fighting. It wants to do that – with honour – and it wants no resumption.The precedent is the winter war of 1939-40. At the outset, Finland looked completely outgunned by the Soviet Union. But, like the Ukrainians, they fought bravely. Like the Ukrainians, they did much better than any outsider predicted. But in the end, they ceded more land than the Soviets were occupying in order to make peace – 11% of their territory, including Karelia (inspiration for their national composer’s most famous piece of music).In 1940, Finland had reason to fear that the Soviets would be back for more. Operation Barbarossa came to their rescue one year later, when the Soviet Union was the target of the biggest land invasion in history. In 2025, Ukraine needs something more immediate. Membership ofNatois the most obvious “something”.Putin won in Anchorage. Now Zelenskyy and Europe are in an even more perilous position | Rajan MenonRead moreZelenskyy won’t like any of this. He would have to consult his cabinet and parliament before conceding any of it. But he would be able to outline the bare bones of a deal to bring to an end the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the second world war, a prize worth taking.Putin, too, wouldn’t like it. A Ukraine whose security is guaranteed by a power other than Moscow is inimical to him. But if Russia rejects an offer everyone else can grudgingly accept, Trump would see Putin for what he has been to date: the problem. He would have the knowledge and justification for upping the US’s contribution to Ukraine’s defence.Today’s meeting in Washington is one of the oddest in modern diplomacy.

Hoarding decades’ worth of “Your Amazon order is out for delivery” notifications in datacentres consumes not just energy but water for cooling, and tech companies arebuilding those datacentresin some of the most water-scarce places in the world.Wakeham called an email cull “something really tangible people might not think of that can make a difference”, and I do want to make a difference. I don’t use water-gobbling ChatGPT, I comply with the hosepipe ban (albeit swearing at YorkshireWateras I slop washing-up water into my shoes transporting it to my dying plants) and my showers are so short they’re basically pointless. So I checked my inbox: 39,674 emails dating back to 2009. Ugh.And what emails! I sampled a random month in 2017 and it was mostly ads (for everything from Pokémon cards to a Thai cafe where I once used the wifi), plus low battery alerts for my long-defunct FitBit, updates on a rat I sponsored (also, surely, long-defunct), PTA round robins and a rudely rejected pitch. Why did I keep them? Why do any of us? Inertia, and overwhelm; irrational anxiety we might need some of it “someday”; a misplaced belief there’s gold in them thar folders (a gif of a leopard trying Marmite I once sent myself admittedly sounded golden, but the link was dead).Maybe – and I’m mostly trying to convince myself here – we could cast off this thirsty digital comfort blanket. Will HMRC ever demand proof I went to Peterborough in 2011? Could I find that cookie recipe another way (say, ooh, by Googling it)?

Public services provide the data and power while US tech giants reap the rewardsMon 18 Aug 2025 13.54 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 14.08 EDTShareThere was a time when Britain aspired to be aleaderin technology. These days, it seems content to be a willing supplicant – handing over itsdata, infrastructure and public services to US tech giants in exchange for the promise of a few percentage points of efficiency gains. Worryingly, the artificial intelligence strategy of Sir Keir Starmer’s government appears long on rhetoric, short on sovereignty and built on techno-utopian assumptions. Last week Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, waspromotingthe use of AI-generated discharge letters in the NHS. The tech, he said, will process complex conversations between doctors and patients, slashing paperwork and streamlining services. Ministers say that by applying AI across the public sector, the government can save£45bn.But step back and a more familiar pattern emerges. AsCecilia Rikap, a researcher at University College London, told the Politics Theory Other podcast, Britain risks becoming a satellite of the US tech industry – a nation whose public infrastructure serves primarily as a testing ground and data source for American AI models hosted on US-owned cloud computing networks. She warned that the UK should not become a site of “extractivism”, in which value – whether in the form of knowledge, labour or electricity – is supplied by Britain but monetised in the US.It’s not just that the UK lacks a domestic cloud ecosystem. It’s that the government’s strategy does nothing to build one. The concern is that public data, much of it drawn from the NHS and local authorities, will be shovelled into models built and trained abroad. The value captured from that data – whether in the form of model refinement or product development – will accrue not to the British public, but to US shareholders. Even the promise of job creation appears shaky. Datacentres, the physical backbone of AI, are capital-intensive, energy-hungry, and each one employs only about50 people.Meanwhile, Daron Acemoglu, the MIT economist and Nobel laureate,offersa still more sobering view: far from ushering in a golden age of labour augmentation, today’s AI rollout is geared almost entirely toward labour displacement. Prof Acemogluseesa fork: AI can empower workers – or replace them. Right now, it is doing the latter. Ministerial pledges of productivity gains may just mean fewer jobs – not better services.The deeper problem is one of imagination. A government serious aboutdigital sovereigntymight build a public cloud, fund open-source AI models and create institutions capable of steering technological development toward social ends. Instead, we are offered efficiency-by-outsourcing – an AI strategy where Britain provides the inputs and America reaps the returns. In a 2024paper, Prof Acemoglu challenged Goldman Sachs’ 10-year forecast that AI would lead to global growth of 7% – about $7tn – and estimated instead under $1tn in gains. Much of this would be captured by US big tech.There’s nothing wrong with harnessing new technologies. But their deployment must not be structured in a way that entrenches dependency and hollows out public capacity. The Online Safety Act shows digital sovereignty can enforce national rules on global platforms, notably onporn sites. But current turmoil at theAlan Turing Institutesuggests a deeper truth: the UK government is dazzled by American AI and has no clear plan of its own. Britain risks becoming not a tech pioneer, but a well-governed client state in someone else’s digital empire.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ministers must throw their weight behind resilient, adaptable agricultureMon 18 Aug 2025 13.53 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 14.08 EDTShareBritish farmers are, of course, not the only people who are suffering from the effects of this summer’s heatwaves. Across Europe and the Middle East, record-breaking temperatures are threatening lives as well as livelihoods. France has experienced its largest wildfire since 1949, while across Europe an estimated500,000 hectares of landhave burned.But farmers are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather, which has a direct impact on crop yields. So reports of a second consecutive year in which food growers in parts of the UK are seeing dramatic falls in production should concern the British public. Access to food is frequently taken for granted in the world’s wealthiest nations. Butincreased food insecurityis among the dangerous effects of the climate crisis, as well as being worsened by Trump’s tariffs, and geopolitical instability including thewar in Ukraine.Last year the problem for British farmers was too much summer rain, leading to waterlogged fields and lost crops. This year the challenge has been the reverse: prolonged, intense hot weather, leading to large parts of England being declared officially indrought. Dramatic local and regional variations complicate the picture. While some farmers are warning of smaller vegetables in supermarkets followingdisappointing early harvests, others have fared quite well. It is too soon to draw firm conclusions or make decisive comparisons with previous years. What is already beyond doubt, however, is the immense challenge of adapting to an altered reality.At a recent water summit hosted by the National Farmers’ Union, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, suggested that the government might support a change to planning rules, making iteasier for farmers to build reservoirson their land. Ministers should work with nature experts as well as farmers to develop this, and other proposals to boost resilience, in an environmentally responsible way. While tensions between the priorities of conservationists and farmers have not gone away, there is also common ground, for example around the need for stronger, long-term water infrastructure and flood risk planning. Last month a survey by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit found thatmore than 80% of UK farmersare worried about the climate crisis.Such fears, along with falls in crop yields and incomes, also help explain the furious reaction to inheritance tax changes introduced last year by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, restricting an exemption for agricultural land. Last week the independent Centre for the Analysis of Taxation proposedamendments to the new rulesthat the Treasury should consider carefully. The chancellor is right to target wealthy, tax-avoiding landowners. But ministerial antagonism toward rural communities serves no purpose and only plays into the populist right’s hands.While farmers are the first to register falling yields, andsmaller heads of broccoli, the productivity and resilience of agricultural land affects everyone who is not insulated by wealth from higher food prices. Last month a thinktank, the Autonomy Institute, argued that the UK is particularly exposed to “climateflation” due to its heavy reliance on food imports. Extreme weather could drive up food prices by more than a third by 2050. With this in mind, the government should seek constructive engagement with farmers, while promoting healthy food policies.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the idea that this deluded and most undiplomatic and unpeaceful of US presidents could ever join such recipients as Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and Martin Luther King Jr is ludicrous.Alfred Nobel intended the prize in the first instance for efforts for “the abolition or reduction of standing armies”. Under Trump, the already bloated Pentagonbudget has skyrocketed; in June hecelebratedthe US army’s 250th birthday (as well as his own birthday) with a military parade, complete with tanks, missiles, and aeroplanes overhead; in February, he signed an executive order to dismantle the US Institute of Peace, resulting in the unlawful firing of its president and board members.Nobel also mentioned in his will efforts to promote “fraternity between nations”. Trump’s Maga programme is at the expense of other nations, causing anger and anxiety in Canada, Denmark, Greenland, Iceland and elsewhere. He is complicit in the destruction of the Palestinian nation and the continuing devastation of Ukraine. The fact that he has been nominated is of little consequence (Hitler was too) and reflects poorly on the nominators.Dr Peter van den DungenVisiting fellow, Norwegian Nobel Institute, 2000Might the inclusion of Mar-a-Lago in the territories to be ceded to Russia get the Trump-Putin deal over the line (No deal, and no answers, after brief Trump-Putin talks on Ukraine in Alaska, 14 August)?Malcolm RushPeterboroughHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Polly Toynbee discusses some possible tax changes, including VAT (Both left and right agree taxes must rise. Time for Labour to get creative, 12 August). My view is that a 2.5 percentage point rise in the average VAT rate is the most viable option to raise sufficient revenue without reducing growth.Toynbee also discusses possible changes to inheritance tax and the introduction of a wealth tax. These policies may be redistributive but are unlikely to raise substantial revenue. As an example, Norway currently imposes a wealth tax that raises less than 3% of its non-petroleum tax revenue.Given the urgent need for revenue, a VAT raise is likely to be the UK’s best option. First, VAT raises significant revenue, at about 17% of total UK tax revenue. This means that a 2.5 percentage point increase may raise as much as £21bn yearly. This is roughly five times more than what it is expected the government will raise from the stricter taxation of non-domiciles.Second, VAT poses limited harm to growth. Since it also applies to people who are outside the labour market, it dampens work incentives less than income taxes do. A VAT rise may partially replace the government’s failure to reform disability benefits. In addition, increases in VAT do not reduce incentives to save, as costs go up by the same ratio today and in the future.And third, VAT can be quite progressive. While new savings are unaffected, old savings that people spend in the future are subject to VAT increases. Most importantly, while the VAT rate is flat, using the revenue to support public services disproportionally benefits the poor. This means that raising sufficient revenue may be most important for progressivity.Kristoffer BergLecturer, Trinity College, University of CambridgeAnent Polly Toynbee’s tax suggestions forLabour, if it regains its heart, may I add two. The best taxes not only raise money but also do societal good. So why not use one to address climate, inequity and safety issues, by taxing cars by their weight and annual mileage as reported at the MOT test? Both relate directly to their energy use.Anthony SeatonEmeritus professor of environmental medicine, University of AberdeenExplore more on these topicsEconomic policyTax and spendingRachel ReevesTaxCar taxLabourlettersShareReuse this content"

Implement them, 12 August), many people are unaware of the outstanding success of 20mph limits and low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) in saving lives and preventing injuries and crashes, because the research and statistics are only being reported consistently by the BBC and the Guardian. People who rely on some of the other media outlets will have seen these policies characterised as unpopular, “hated” or a “war on drivers”. The failure to report impartially is a distortion of the truth that is misleading the public and politicians, and leading to pressure to revoke these life-saving measures.Highway authorities have a statutory duty to promote road safety, a duty to have “due regard” to the needs of elderly and disabled people, and a common law duty of care to all road users not to be negligent. On top of this, councils have duties relating to public health, and policies relating to active lifestyles and the prevention of obesity, all of which are supported by creating safer streets.Councillors are obliged to ensure their decisions are reasonable and based on relevant considerations. While councillors and officers are protected by statutory immunity, this protection does not extend to deliberate or reckless wrongdoing. The science and evidence are totally clear: revocation of 20mph limits or LTNs will lead to crashes, injuries and deaths. Councillors and their advisers who pursue such actions risk being held personally liable for the harm that ensues.Robert HuxfordDirector, Urban Design GroupSadiq Khandescribes the safety benefits of 20mph limits in urban areas. Hopefully, the increased carbon emissions from the petrol and diesel cars being driven at inefficient speeds will be balanced out by the smoother overall traffic flow and the much greater efficiency of electric vehicles at low speeds. There are even greater benefits to be had from a lower national speed limit of 55mph as road transport decarbonises, but that does not have a champion since the idea was recommended and then inexplicably dropped by the Climate Change Committee.Daniel ScharfAbingdon, OxfordshireI congratulate Sadiq Khan on the excellent progress he has made. I would ask, though, whether more speed cameras can be installed. There is a road from Putney to Wimbledon which is 20mph along its whole length, with just one speed camera. Once past this camera, cars speed up and overtake drivers who are maintaining the speed limit. Sadiq should ask councils to install more cameras with the carrot of letting them keep the ensuing fines.Shirley PritchardWimbledon, LondonAs a reluctant pedestrian, following a stroke, I have to walk miles along urban roads, using a robust walking stick. It’s essential – not for balance but to vent my anger at threatening drivers who speed past and often instinctively veer towards the pavement away from oncoming traffic.Andrew MorganPoole, DorsetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

However, Moyes said he was disappointed not just with that decision, but with the overall standard across the first round of fixtures.Lukas Nmecha holds nerve to sink Everton and crown Leeds’ return to big timeRead more“I’m obviously going to say it’s not a penalty and I believe it’s not a penalty,” he said of the winning goal. “I’ve been to see the referee. The referee sort of took nothing to do with it, he thought it was to do with VAR, the decision they’ve made. I don’t know what else I can say.”But Moyes did not stop there in his criticism. “I actually think the referees have had a poor weekend in the opening weekend,” he said. “I think there have been a lot of [poor] decisions and tonight’s is another one. The rules are supposed to be that if you keep your hands down to your side and if anything he’s tried to get it behind his back as well.“The ball takes a deflection on the flight as well. You’re allowed to block it and he’s leaned towards the ball, we accept that. We saw one on Friday night [inLiverpool v Bournemouth] that wasn’t given, which looked far clearer a handball than what it was tonight.”Moyes admittedEvertondid not deserve anything from the game at Elland Road and said they will have to be patient with new signing Jack Grealish, who appeared only for the final 19 minutes on Monday evening.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I thought that I would improve during the night. It came up worse. I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn’t handle more. I’m very, very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday maybe had to work or do something else, so I’m very, very sorry.”World’s best ready to sprinkle stardust on US Open mixed doubles | Tumaini CarayolRead moreIn 31C (87F) heat and 57% humidity, extremely difficult conditions but temperatures they have both had to navigate since the early rounds, Sinner looked completely off from the beginning and his condition only appeared to worsen during his five games on the court.Sinner opened the match with a sloppy opening service game, missing three of his first four first serves as Alcaraz eased to an early break. From the start of the set, Sinner looked determined to keep points as short as possible as he lashed out at forehands and accordingly committed increasingly wild unforced errors. Between points, Sinner walked gingerly and his face looked flushed. As the set wore on, his movement and leg drive on his strokes deteriorated.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz celebrates his victory.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesAlcaraz has not always handled himself well when facing ailing opponents, including on Saturday night when he struggled briefly against a sick Alexander Zverev. To his credit, Alcaraz offered Sinner no free points, maintained his own intensity and made himself look incredibly difficult to beat. Down 0-4, Sinner requested the trainer out on the court but after serving a double fault to fall 0-5 behind, he decided it was time to end the match.After the pair embraced at the net, Alcaraz walked over to Sinner’s bench and put an arm around his rival’s shoulders. Sinner then explained to Alcaraz that he had not been feeling well for some time but he had “tried to come out for the fans”. Alcaraz responded: “Don’t worry at all.”Two years ago, Alcaraz lost an incredible match against Novak Djokovic in the Cincinnati final, a match that is widely considered one of the greatest three-set matches of all time. Although he returned to take the title, this was not how he imagined it. With the trophy in his hands, Alcaraz appeared lost for words as he addressed the crowd. “As you said, Jannik, this is not the way I want to win matches, to win the trophy. I just gotta say sorry. I know and understand how you can feel right now. I can’t say anything you don’t know already, but as I say many times you are truly a champion. I’m pretty sure from this situation you’re going to come back stronger. You always do – that’s what true champions do. You really are one. Sorry and come back stronger.”Alcaraz has now won eight ATP Masters 1000 titles by the age of 22 – only Rafael Nadal achieved eight Masters 1000 titles at a younger age.

The 27-year-old forward has also been tracked by Arsenal, the club he supported as a boy and played for during his formative years.Eze’s contract at Palace contained a £68m release clause but it expired last Friday. Spurs hope to get him for around £55m plus bonuses. Eze’s previous club, Queens Park Rangers, are entitled to 15% of any profits that Palace make on him. Palace paid around £19m to QPRfor the player in August 2020.Romero has re-signed at Spurs until 2029 and it represents something of a turnaround for him after he was linked with a move away at the start of the summer. The Argentina centre-half has made no secret of his ambition to one day play in Spain and he was of interest to Atlético Madrid. But having been given the Spurs captaincy after the departure ofSon Heung-min to Los Angeles FC, the 27-year-old has re-emphasised his commitment.

The club are believed to have failed with an initial offer of £20m for El Khannouss, whose release clause expired at the weekend, with Leicester thought to want around £26m for the Morocco forward. Palace have also made an offer of £25m for Tzolis, a Greece international who spent three seasons at Norwich.Oliver Glasner said he expected Eze to play for Palace in the Conference League playoff first leg against Fredrikstad at Selhurst Park on Thursday. If he did, he would still be able to play for another team in the league phase of European competition this season.Marc Guéhi is also expected to feature on Thursday as Liverpool have yet to match Palace’s £40m valuation of the England defender, whose contract expires at the end of the season. Guéhi is understood to be willing to stay at Selhurst Park and leave on a free transfer although the Palace chair, Steve Parish, has admitted that he would prefer to sell the 25-year-old this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And perhaps that was true, but they’re a useful weapon to have. Some games are won by overwhelming opponents through superior technical ability and some games are won by organization and hard work, by finding a way to score and a way to keep their opponent out. Arsenal’s1-0 win at Old Traffordon Sunday was definitely one of the latter.Manchester United do not defend inswinging corners well. Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka both excel at taking inswinging corners. In that sense, the fact that the game was decided by United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir’s flap at a Rice inswinger was entirely to be expected. What was less predictable was the nature of the game that followed as United hit the post and David Raya was called into seven saves. Mikel Arteta, quite reasonably, praised his side’s “character and spirit” while acknowledging they had made “mistakes that are very far from the standards that we normally have.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Winning without playing well, though, has not often been the Arsenal way recently; in that sense, there was perhaps encouragement to be drawn from the hard-earned nature of the three points.That they will surely do. A certain rustiness in the opening game is only natural, particularly with new players to integrate. Viktor Gyökeres will adjust at least to an extent to the pace of the game. Martin Zubimendi looked appalled that the swinging arm with which Bryan Mbeumo caught him early on wasn’t penalized, but he will surely learn to handle the knocks and bumps and flailing limbs of English football. Arteta acknowledged it would take both time to get up to speed but pronounced himself satisfied with how they had played. The “mistakes” will be ironed out. A degree of fluency will return.But until then, it’s good to have the set-plays. Arsenal have scored 31 times from corners since the beginning of the 2023-24 season, at least 11 more than any other side in thePremier League. That’s a valuable weapon to have, particularly for a team that has so regularly been criticized for having to dominate a game to win it. In that sense, the win at Old Trafford was a little like Arsenal’s victory over Aston Villa in their first away game of last season, a game chiefly notable for an extraordinary double save from Raya. Praise them for getting the result without playing especially well, for showing what in hindsight might be regarded as the grit of champions, or question why they didn’t play especially well? The answer to that will only become apparent as the season goes on.‘I want to keep this club in the promised land’: Farke’s mission to keep Leeds upRead moreArsenal, though, probably can take comfort and more than a degree of satisfaction from having beaten United away. True, nine sides did that last season, but Ruben Amorim’s side surely won’t be as bad this campaign as they were then. Old Trafford may again become a difficult place to go, as United’s squad settles and the impact of not having to play European football comes to be felt; having got the game against them out of the way early may end up being fortunate.Of the four realistic title contenders, Arsenal had the hardest start and without excelling have three points on the board, which is more than can be said ofChelseaafter their0-0 draw with Crystal Palace. The world champions have a hugely gifted squad, particularly in forward areas but, with Benoît Badiashile, Wesley Fofana and Levi Colwill all suffering long-term injuries, look a little short at the back, while doubts persist about Robert Sánchez. The goalkeeper was perhaps fortunate that VAR ruled out Eberechi Eze’s free kick that flew past him, but the bigger issue on Sunday was the lack of creativity. Upgrading from Nicolas Jackson at centre-forward has not proved an instant panacea.Manchester City were the most impressive of the contenders on opening weekend, with the new signing in midfield Tijjani Reijnders starring in the4-0 win at Wolves. Given the sort of space Wolves afforded them, they will cut teams apart but the openness they exhibited at times last season and again in the Club World Cup has not gone away; better sides than Wolves may be able to exploit that. Liverpool looked at least as open in their4-2 win over Bournemouthand, like Arsenal, were left grateful for their resilience as they scored twice after the 88th minute to secure the three points. They too have work to do in balancing the side and integrating new signings.None of the probable top four were at anything like their best. All will find a greater cohesion as the season goes on. But Arsenal have got one of the trickier away games out of the way.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

I was truly grateful and surprised about how much people wanted to sponsor me because I have never done something like this before.”Foaese said fundraising came into her mind as soon as she heard of her selection for the World Cup. “Our team had spoken about what everyone was going to do to help support ourselves individually.“I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it, but [someone said] you might need help living-wise and to make sure the kids were sorted while I was away.”View image in fullscreenSamoa’s Nina Foaese sought funds to cover her expenses at home while she is at the Women’s World Cup.Photograph: Johan Rynners/World Rugby/Getty ImagesThe financial reality among the other teams is a mixed picture. The four home nations all have contracts in place. England’s 32 deals range from £39,000 to £48,000 and players receive £1,500 per game. Wales pay £23,000 to £30,000 for 37 players and Scotland £18,000 to £27,000. Ireland have 37 contracts in the region of £15,000 to £30,000.New Zealand, the defending champions, have 45 full‑time contracts, which vary from NZ$50,000 to NZ$70,000 (approximately £21,900-£30,600). The Black Ferns players also receive NZ $2,000 per week in assembly fees during tournaments and other benefits such as life and trauma insurance.Canada, who are among the favourites, do not have fixed contracts, but pay their players per tournament and have equal pay with the men’s team. A Canadian competing in all competitions this year would expect to receive CAN$12,000 (£6,400).Australia have 46 contracts, which range from A$15,000 to $70,000 (£7,200-£33,600) and players are paid per day in camp so that, if they are selected for all squads, they can boost their earnings by A$15,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The first question posed to him on this subject was carefully prefaced with the acknowledgment that mixed doubles was probably not his priority in the middle of one of the biggest tournaments in the world. As a grin spread across his face, Fritz interjected: “It is a priority.”Fritz had been asked whether he had any sympathy for the frustrated doubles specialists who had been brushed aside to make room for the transformation of this event. From his perspective, the right players were in the draw. “I’ve seen a lot of people calling it like an exhibition, or it doesn’t count,” he said.“I think this is the strongest mixed doubles field you’re going to see at a grand slam. If the mixed doubles teams that are in come in and win the event, then I’ll eat my words and say I’m wrong, but I think the level is going to be really high.”Iga Swiatek powers into first Cincinnati final with battling win over RybakinaRead moreAfter six months of anticipation, the revamped US Open mixed‑doubles tournament is finally here.Usually the domain of doubles specialists with the exception of the very occasional superstar pairing, mixed doubles rarely generates much fanfare and at the grand slams it has come to represent more opportunities for trophies and prize money for doubles specialists.While the event usually runs at the same time as the rest of the grand slam main draws, this year it will be held in the week leading up to the start of the singles main draw.Sixteen teams will compete in a knockout draw across Tuesday and Wednesday. The first three rounds will be decided in abbreviated four‑game sets while the final will be determined in standard six-game sets. The winners will take home $1m between them, an $800,000 increase on last year. In an era where the top players have largely spurned doubles because of the increased physical demands of singles competition, the ultimate aim of the event is to attract the stars.View image in fullscreenReigning champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori are the only doubles specialists in the draw.Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/APFor that reason, officials at the United States Tennis Association (USTA) already feel like the glittering player field and the interest it has generated has justified the move. The partnership betweenCarlos Alcarazand Emma Raducanu has created countless headlines, but other distinguished entrants include Novak Djokovic and his compatriot Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek with Casper Ruud, and Fritz alongside Elena Rybakina. The only doubles specialist team are the Italian defending champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.In a truly meaningful event, the players would be scrambling for the most advantageous pairings. Since the initial entry list, numerous withdrawals have followed. Navarro’s withdrawal actually led Sinner to possibly find an even better partner in Katerina Siniakova, an 11-time grand slam champion. Jack Draper, meanwhile, is now on his third partner, Jessica Pegula, after his previous partners, Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa, withdrew from the US Open.Despite how much it has changed, the draw makes for surreal viewing with so many prominent singles players present. The first two lines are particularly noteworthy:Alcaraz and Raducanu have been drawn against the top seeds, Draper and Pegula, meaning the British No 1s are scheduled to do battle on Tuesday afternoon.Over the past few months on the tour, mixed doubles at the US Open has been a popular subject in player lounges at tournaments. Madison Keys, who is paired with Frances Tiafoe, says she has received FaceTime calls from Tiafoe with questions about their partnership, such as on which side she would prefer to play.Even on the eve of the tournament, there is still serious doubt surrounding the participation of some of the most prominent players in the draw. Alcaraz and Swiatek were competing in Cincinnati less than 24 hours before their first‑round mixed doubles matches in New York, meaning they will have an extremely short turnaround after a gruelling two-week event. Alternates should be ready.Quick GuideEdmund announces retirementShowThe former British No 1 Kyle Edmund has announced his retirement from tennis at the age of 30.Edmund won two ATP titles and became only the second British man after Sir Andy Murray to reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2018. He was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years, and also represented his country at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.Unfortunately, Edmund’s ascent into the world’s top 50 corresponded with a knee injury that required three operations and kept him off the tour for almost two years.In a statement issued by the Lawn Tennis Association, Edmund said: “The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries [and] my body is telling me it’s finally reached the end point. Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was. There are no regrets whatsoever.”Edmund, who defeated Novak Djokovic at the ATP Masters in 2018, made progress in his latest comeback attempt but decided the Nottingham Challenger final defeat against Jack Pinnington Jones last month would be his last match.He said on social media: “Of course to beat Novak, probably the greatest player of all time, was a great feeling and probably the biggest scalp of my career. I spent four or five years trying to come back and was never fully able to reach my goal. But over the next few weeks and months it will be a nice time to reflect and spend more time with my family and appreciate the journey.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The excitement from many of the singles players is counterbalanced by disappointment from doubles specialists who feel they have been pushed out of the event. Singles rankings determine the entry list so they did not come close to making the cut. “When two world No 1s in doubles don’t get into the tournament, there’s probably nothing more to say about it,” Siniakova said on Canal+.Ben Shelton, who is paired with the No 1 doubles player Taylor Townsend, is empathetic towards the doubles players’ frustrations. Shelton says: “I totally understand the honour of playing mixed doubles and what a mixed doubles title means, especially to those guys and girls, and I feel for them that they’re not able to play this year,. “At the same time, I understand the business mind of the US Open and what they’re trying to do to generate more revenue, make their event more profitable and have more excitement around it. That’s the craziest lineup that you’ve seen at mixed doubles in your life.”A longtime member of the WTA player council, Pegula questions the US Open’s decision to make such a significant change without properly consulting the players, a common complaint. Communication with players, she believes, could have actually addressed some of these problems. “I felt like that was a really good example where we were like: ‘OK, you guys just kind of went rogue and changed the whole entire format and didn’t tell anybody, and you just kind of did it.’ And it was kind of like: ‘Did you talk to the players? Did you get input, maybe on how it could have been better?’”In the same breath, though, Pegula has expressed her excitement for the tournament ahead.This will not be the defining moment of any of these players’ careers, but they are intensely competitive beings who step on to the tennis court every day with the intention of winning, regardless of the format. For at least 30 minutes of their lives, this event will be a priority for many.Keys said: “I mean, there’s a grand slam trophy on the line and have you seen the prize money? I’m gonna try real hard.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Emma RaducanuCarlos AlcarazUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The trip from Manchester made her back stiff. Soon afterwards, she tore her right hamstring.“It was four hours in a car one way and four hours back,” says Trevor Painter, one of her coaches. “If she does things like that, it does mess her back up a little bit. And unfortunately it was a couple of sessions after that when the problem occurred.”Keely Hodgkinson takes astonishing 800m Diamond League win after 376 days outRead moreIt was Hodgkinson’s third such injury in nine months – after those to her left hamstring in August and February – and the setback would have ripped the heart out of most mortals. On Saturday, in Silesia, Hodgkinson proved once again that she was out of the box.Usually, the advice when returning from injury is to play it safe, shake off the cobwebs and focus on bigger targets ahead. Butin her first race in 376 dayssincewinning Olympic 800m goldin Paris the 23-year-old only went and blew the bloody doors off. It was not just that her time of 1min 54.74sec was the fastest in the world this year, by almost two seconds. Or that it was the ninth-quickest in history. It was the way she did it: pedal pressed hard to the metal, refusing to give into doubt or ease up before the line.It was one of the most quietly impressive things I’ve seen this sporting year, especially as Hodgkinson was not confident behind the scenes. “There was a lot of pressure on her,” Painter says. “It was her first race since the Olympics and there were people on X saying we’re deluded when the Wavelight technology showed we were going for 1:54.6. She asked me: ‘Do you think I can do this?’ And I was like: ‘Of course.’”It was also one in the eye for the armchair critics, who have long questioned Hodgkinson’s love of posting TikToks, fashion and having fun. “Keely gets a lot of stick online, especially while she’s been injured,” says Painter. “People keep saying, ‘Oh, stop doing TikToks and get training and stuff like that’.” Well, she is training. She’s working damn hard. But she plays hard as well and relaxes in her way. Her way is making goofy videos on TikTok.”Painter’s confidence in Hodgkinson proved to be spot on. But her performance only reinforced what we learned in Paris: that Hodgkinson is Britain’s greatest sporting talent. Sure,Rory McIlroy completed a career grand slamthis year,Luke Littler won his first world darts titleand theLionesses won the Euros. But which other Briton dominates a global sport the way she does?View image in fullscreenKeely Hodgkinson’s last race before Saturday in Poland was her win in the Olympic 800m in Paris.Photograph: Dave Shopland/ShutterstockThe scary thing is that she should only get better now she is much stronger then before. “Because of her injury she has only been in spikes for six weeks,” says Painter. “We had to start off slow and she’s still not run that quick, really, in terms of speed work in training. But she’s very, very strong because of the way we’ve had to train all year. I think she’s got a 1:53 in her. But you need the right race, the right weather and the right track.”That brings Jarmila Kratochvilova’s longstanding, and controversial, world record of 1:53.28 into play, with the Czech athlete setting her time in 1983 when doping was rife behind the iron curtain. Kratochvilova has always maintained her physique came from working on her uncle’s farm.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But she’s planning to carry on and do the Athlos meeting in New York in October. So you never know. If we can tempt [the Dutch 400m hurdles runner] Femke Bol to come to New York to pace Keely to 600m then it might be on.”Whatever happens next, Hodgkinson’s team are determined the injuries that put a long pause on her 2025 campaign will not happen again. In training, she does fewer high-intensity sessions and more endurance work. But the biggest difference is that the M11 track club, run by Painter and his wife, Jenny Meadows, also now has a full-time physiotherapist funded by Nike, one of Hodgkinson’s sponsors.“We’re just making sure Keely’s body’s in the right place before she does any sort of fast running because of the problems she’s had,” Painter says. “But it’s benefiting the whole group and not just Keely.”Perhaps the only surprise is that Hodgkinson is not a bigger name. Yes, she has more than half a million followers on Instagram and won the2024 BBC Sports Personality of the Year.But if we were in the 70s or 80s she would be on the back pages every time she sneezed and BBC and ITV would be fighting to show her races.That is partly a wider issue with track and field, which yo‑yos between being the biggest Olympic sport every four years and hidden behind the red button or streamed on obscure websites. But the Diamond League meeting in Silesia on Saturday, broadcast on BBC Two, proved another compelling advert for the sport with several high-quality races, including athrilling men’s Olympic 100m final rematchbetween Kishane Thompson and Noah Lyles and a gutsy attempt by Faith Kipyegon to beat the highly contentious women’s world 3,000m record, set in 1993 by China’s Wang Junxia. As Painter says, there was certainly a lot more drama than in a typical Formula One race, where, as he put it, the same car wins most of the time.Whether track and field’s fortunes can be revived is a discussion for another day. But in Hodgkinson it certainly has Britain’s most talented sports star. And it is not even close.Explore more on these topicsSportKeely HodgkinsonAthleticscommentShareReuse this content"

It will be an afternoon when most punters are looking 24 hours ahead to the St Leger meeting at Doncaster.As a result, there is a raised awareness of the deep concerns about government plans to harmonise the duty rates for online betting and casino-style gaming products, which could, according to modelling commissioned by the British Horseracing Authority, cost the sport between £66m and £160m in annual income.Horse racing to go on strike in protest against government’s planned betting tax riseRead moreThere will be further coverage on the day itself to add to the balance sheet, the races concerned will be restaged at other meetings to minimise the loss of media rights income and the degree of cooperation required between the BHA and racing’s two biggest racecourse ownership groups is also a positive for the sport.The response of the main industry body, the Betting and Gaming Council, to the news was instructive, too. “Racing’s decision to reschedule fixtures was taken without consultation with betting operators, whose support for the funding of the sport is mission critical,” the BGC said on Sunday. “We are concerned that futile political gestures will only antagonise the government and frustrate punters, instead of delivering a solution to a shared challenge facing both racing and betting.”This followed hot on the heels of a suggestion by Michael Dugher, the BGC’s chair, ina column in the Racing Postthat “any increase in costs gets passed on not just to the sport, through reduced spend on sponsorship, but also punters. That might mean worse odds, fewer offers, less generous promotions.”The same column also included perhaps the most absurd sentence to appear in the pages of the sport’s trade paper since Fred Done, the chair of BetFred, suggested that cutting the maximum stake on roulette machines in betting shops from £100 to £2 could force him to close his entire high-street estate.“The idea that betting on horseracing is purely a game of ‘skill’ and not also a game of ‘chance’ is nonsense,” Dugher wrote. “How many punters back a horse because they like the name or the colours?

Instead, skill is an essential element of the process. Every horse has its chance and its price and the skill lies in judging one against the other. It is the complete absence of skill in gaming that is one of the fundamental differences between the two.Taken as a whole, the BGC’s response to the strike action is informative, because it should leave no one in racing with any lingering doubt that those traditional betting brands many still think of as “the bookies” are now just subsidiaries of global gambling operators, whose primary concern is the risk-free profits from fixed-margin gaming.The BGC wants racing to argue for no change at all – ie 15% duty on betting and 21% on gaming – when that is the one thing that is almost certainly not going to happen. The government needs funds, the Treasury has already consulted on harmonisation andgambling revenue is a blindingly obvious target for a tax hike. As a result, and as the debate over gambling duty rolls on towards the autumn budget, the realistic best-case and worst-case scenarios for racing and the gambling industry are almost precisely opposed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The realistic best-case outcome, despite the sport’s calls to “Axe the Racing Tax” completely, is probably a small rise in betting duty – perhaps alongside possible reform of the Levy to ease some of the pain – and a much more significant hike in the rate for gaming, to reflect the increased risk of gambling-related harm.The gambling industry would regard harmonisation at either 21% or 25% as a huge let-off. It is the thought of a possible rise in gaming duty – perhaps to 40% or more that they willingly pay to access gaming markets elsewhere – that is keeping their CEOs awake at night.Racing’s strike will not tip the balance one way or the other, but it is a long way from being the “futile political gesture” the BGC would have you believe. And if that organisation’s chair thinks that a pacemaker getting loose on the lead in the Sussex Stakes means racing is little different from roulette, it is conceivably a sign they are starting to feel the heat.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingTalking HorsesSport bettingHorse racing tipscommentShareReuse this content"

The top flight is planning to launch its own anti-homophobia initiative in February to coincide with LGBTQ+ History Month.Prospective football agents to take case over Fifa’s online exam to CasRead moreThe Premier League has no plans to cut ties with Kick It Out, a pioneer in combating racism and championing diversity since forming in 1993 as a campaign group, Let’s Kick Racism Out of Football. Despite making considerable progress in driving racism out of stadiums, black players remain targets for abuse, as was demonstrated on Friday when the Bournemouth forwardAntoine Semenyo was allegedly racially abusedduring the first Premier League game of the season at Anfield.Social media abuse is also rife, with the England defenderJess Carter revealing she received racist online messagesduring Euro 2025. That led to the Lionesses ending their pre-match gesture of taking the knee, after five years, for the semi-final and final of the tournament. The Premier League captains decided last week to continue taking the knee this season, but before only the two games during Black History Month in October.The Premier League declined to comment on its new funding arrangements with Kick It Out, but sources indicated a belief that a shorter deal will provide more flexibility to support specific programmes. The new funding deal is understood to have conditions attached regarding programme delivery, in line with the Premier League’s policy towards funding external groups. Kick It Out also declined to comment.View image in fullscreenRichard Masters is keen for the Premier League to be more in control of its own campaigns on diversity and inclusion.Photograph: Jon Super/APThe Premier League has significantly increased the staff numbers and resources committed to its own inclusion work in recent years. The former Huddersfield and Gillingham striker Iffy Onuora was appointed in 2021 as its first head of equality, diversity and inclusion, with Kuljit Randhawa joining as the head of diversity and inclusion strategy the following year.The Premier League has also set up a Black Participants’ Advisory Group, comprising former players and managers including Wes Morgan, Darren Moore and Chris Hughton, to provide additional advice.“We’re confident enough now to speak in our own voice,” the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said last week in reference to the Stonewall partnership. “We’re confident to put our own activations together, talking to clubs and stakeholders about it. Whatever activation we do is going to be in February and we look forward to making some announcements about it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We believe promoting our campaigns now, ensuring they are going to work, is the way forward.”The league’s moves into this area have caused tensions with Kick It Out in the past, most notably when it launched the No Room for Racism campaign six years ago without informing the charity. To compound matters, the first No Room for Racism weekend, in March 2019, took place during fixtures reserved previously for Kick It Out events.While the league’s commitment to combating racism is not in doubt, industry experts have warned privately that an independent body such as Kick It Out should not be replaced, because the charity is better positioned to hold authorities and clubs to account.Explore more on these topicsKick It OutPremier LeagueRacenewsShareReuse this content"

For Eddy Grant, a world full of problems left him rooted to the spot as the music played.But for police officers amid the sound systems at this weekend’sNotting Hill carnival, it is orders from on high that dictate that no matter how the beat moves them, they are banned from dancing with revellers.Down the decades the scenes of officersstruttingtheir stuff was seen as acheesybutwelcome attemptat repairing strained community relations.But in a statement on Monday, the Metropolitan police made it clear they feel a twerk or rhythmic shake of the hips may distract or slow down the 7,000 officers deployed to the carnival from responding to outbreaks of crime.The carnival is the biggest annual challenge for the Met. For the overwhelming majority of the more than 1 million people attending, it is the biggest celebration of Caribbean culture in Europe and one of the biggest entertainment gatherings in the world.But the carnival’s two-day takeover of the streets of west London is dogged by serious crimes.Last year there were two murdersand more than 60 officers were injured, as well as constant fears among police commanders of a catastrophic crush with so many people packed in narrow streets.One police source justified the dancing ban, which was first implemented in 2019, and said: “Carnival is a fantastic event but it is a serious event.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a statement the Met confirmed the dancing ban, and a spokesperson said: “Carnival is an iconic and spectacular event which attracts hundreds of thousands of people every year to party and celebrate Caribbean culture.“But it is also an event where there have been numerous concerns about crowd safety and crime. As a consequence, almost 7,000 officers will be deployed to this year’s event. They are there to keep revellers safe, not to join in the revelling.“We want officers to positively engage with the carnivalgoers while staying vigilant at all times and remaining able to respond and intervene swiftly as necessary. They can’t do this if they are dancing.“The standards of behaviour expected as part of the policing operation will be communicated clearly before the event, just as they have been in recent years.”Notting Hill carnival dates back almost seven decades, starting as a celebration of resistance in an openly racist Britain. This year police will controversiallydeploy live facial recognition systemsin the approaches to the carnival, hoping to catch wanted suspects and deter people from attending who want to cause trouble.The carnival starts on Sunday with a day for children and families, and its busiest day is usually bank holiday Monday.

Having initially pleaded not guilty, her change of plea means she will avoid a trial that had been planned for August.Prosecutors had cast Sangha as a prolific drug dealer who was known to her customers as the “ketamine queen”, using the term often in press releases and court documents and even including it in the official name of the case.A federal indictment charged Sangha with one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine, one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, one count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, one count of possession with intent to distribute ketamine and five counts of distribution of ketamine.Sangha will officially change her plea to guilty at an upcoming hearing, where sentencing will be scheduled, prosecutors said. She could get up to 45 years in prison. An email sent to Sangha’s lawyers seeking comment was not immediately answered.Sangha was indicted in June, and she – along with four other defendants, including Perry’s personal assistant and two doctors – was arrested in August. She and Dr Salvador Plasencia were charged with conspiracy to distribute ketamine, distribution of ketamine resulting in death, possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, and altering and falsifying records related to a federal investigation.She and Plasencia, who signed his own plea deal on 16 June, were the primary targets of the investigation. Three other defendants – Dr Mark Chavez, Kenneth Iwamasa and Erik Fleming – agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation, which included statements implicating the pair.Doctor pleads guilty to giving Matthew Perry ketamine leading up to his deathRead morePerry was found dead in hisLos Angeleshome by Iwamasa, his assistant, on 28 October 2023. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anesthetic, was the primary cause of death.The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor as a legal, but off-label, treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. Perry, 54, sought more ketamine than his doctor would give him. He began getting it from Plasencia about a month before his death, then started getting still more from Sangha about two weeks before his death, prosecutors said.Perry and Iwamasa found Sangha through Perry’s friend Fleming. In their plea agreements, both men described the subsequent deals in detail.Fleming messaged Iwamasa saying Sangha’s ketamine was “unmarked but it’s amazing”, according to court documents. Fleming texted Iwamasa that she only deals “with high end and celebs. If it were not great stuff she’d lose her business.”With the two men acting as middlemen, Perry bought large amounts of ketamine from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash four days before his death. That purchase included the doses that killed Perry, prosecutors said.On the day of Perry’s death, Sangha told Fleming they should delete all the messages they had sent each other, according to her indictment.Her home in North Hollywood,California, was raided in March 2024 by Drug Enforcement Administration agents who found large amounts of methamphetamines and ketamine, according to an affidavit from an agent.None of the defendants has yet been sentenced.Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time onFriends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC’s hit series.In his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, released in 2022, Perry wrote about how he became an alcoholic as a teenager and developed an addiction to pain medication following a 1997 jet skiing accident. His addictions took a major toll on his life, Perry wrote, at one point putting him in a coma and costing him about $7m to get sober.After his death, a foundation was set up in his name to help those struggling with addiction.Explore more on these topicsMatthew PerryTelevisionFriendsDrugsCaliforniaLos AngelesWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

We’re going to stay strong. We’re going to stay committed to making sure those workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” said Mark Hancock. “And if means folks like me going to jail, then so be it.”Hancock said members want a solution, “but that solution has to be found at a bargaining table”.Flight attendants with Air Canada went on strike on Saturday after months of failed negotiations with Canada’s flagship carrier over wages. Ahead of the work stoppage, Air Canada warned that a shutdown could affect 130,000 people a day.Air Canada flight attendants to defy back-to-work order and remain on strikeRead moreLess than 12 hours after the strike took effect, however, the country’s jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, used her broad powers to impose binding arbitration on both parties – a move the union representing flight attendants decried as unconstitutional.“The talks broke down,” Hajdu told reporters over the weekend. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”Air Canada initially said it planned to resume flights on Sunday, but the union said it would defy the government’s back-to-work order and accused the governing Liberal party of trampling on workers’ rights and setting a “terrible” precedent.“The Liberals have talked out of both sides of their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table. They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,” Wesley Lesosky, a senior member of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a statement.“Now, when we’re at the bargaining table with an obstinate employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and give Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation.”Following an emergency hearing on Sunday requested by Air Canada, the industrial relations board sided with the federal government and airline.“The members of the union’s bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,” according to a directive from the board.The union said it intends to challenge government-imposed binding arbitration in a federal court.If they defy the order from the labour board, union heads can be arrested and union members face the prospect of steep fines.The prime minister, Mark Carney, said it was “disappointing” the stalled negotiations had not yielded a new contract.“We recognize very much the critical role that flight attendants play in keeping Canadians and their families safe as they travel, comfortable as they travel,” Carney told reporters on Monday. “And it’s important that they’re compensated equitably at all times, fairly at all times.”On Monday morning, Air Canada said it hoped to resume flights later in the day, but also suspended its financial guidance for the third quarter and its full year due to the shutdown. The strike is expected to cost the airline tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings each day.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

A downwards tilting camera angle made the model’s head appear “out of proportion with the rest of her body and further highlighted her small frame”.In response,M&S saidit “took concerns about the depiction of body image in [its] ads very seriously”. The shoes had “only been chosen for stylistic and fashion purposes” while the camera angle “had not been chosen to exaggerate the model’s proportions”.The watchdog typically receives five or six complaints a week about such ads, but after the ruling against M&S in July that increased to more than 20. In 2024, it received a total of 61 complaints about the size of models in adverts. According to the ASA,45% of the UK publicare concerned about ads that include idealised body images of women.Parker, who has worked for the ASA for more than 30 years, said a wider “return to thinness in fashion” was causing an increase in complaints. “It is not unprecedented,” he said. “Fashion trends go in cycles. In the 90s we had a‘heroin chic’period and we banned several ads back then. Our rules have long required ads to be socially responsible. It may be that we’re kind of back in that sort of space today.”The rise of weight-loss medication may also be affecting the types of bodies being portrayed in ads. “There is a connection between the two,” said Parker, who is overseeing a project focusing on injectable versions. “There have been too many cases of advertisers, many of whom should know better, promoting prescription-only weight-loss medicines to the public. That is against the law and our codes.”The watchdog has previously beenaccused of double standardsfor allowing campaigns starring plus-size models, with some online critics calling such models obese. Parker said a wider cultural context played a part here. “We know in the UK currently, society tends to view thinness as aspirational. That’s not the same case when it comes to being overweight.”Parker said it was important not to “demonise the models that have been featured in ads”. The rulings are generally not about the model’s body but about how advertisers may have manipulated images of a model. Lighting, makeup and the type of poses used all play a role.Parker said the final images selected for use was crucial, pointing to arecent ruling against Zaraas an example of this. In four adverts, starring two models, the ASA found that shadows used over one of the model’s legs made them “appear noticeably thin”, while the low-cut design of a shirt worn by the other model created “a focal point around her collarbone, which was protruding”. Two other adverts starring the same models did not breach its code.Responding to the ruling, Zara said during its hiring process both models had provided medical certificates proving they were in good health.Parker said: “The key moment is when you are selecting the images because there will probably be a whole bunch of images of the model you can use but there might be some that you shouldn’t. It comes down to these advertisers making sure that they have got a stage in their compliance process that actively and consciously checks to make sure irresponsible images don’t slip through.”Noticeable bones are especially contentious. “We have had issues where ribs are really visible. Sometimes it is very thin-looking arms or thin-looking legs. I say thin-looking rather than thin because it is about how models are presented in clothes, not the model per se.”Parker said “thin” was subjective. “I don’t think any of these advertisers are intentionally promoting this sort of concept of unhealthy thinness. But that can sometimes be the result if they are not really careful about the images they select to use.”Explore more on these topicsAdvertisingRetail industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The fishing club says this will kill off the fish, which need a certain level of oxygen to live.View image in fullscreenThe Amwell Magna Fishery on the River Lea in Hertfordshire in 1888.Photograph: AlamyEngland is in the grip of a devastating drought, with hosepipe bans in place in areas across the country and water companies askingpermission to abstractwater from rivers that are already below a viable state.How can England possibly be running out of water?Read moreSharkey has called the EA’s actions “environmental vandalism unmatched in recent history”. He and the fishing club have enlisted the law firm Leigh Day to write a pre-action protocol letter.According to the letter, the EA began reducing the flow of the River Lea between Ware and Stanstead Abbotts on 3 June 2025, without, the letter claims, any statutory authority. The EA has not given a reason for the abstraction, but similar methods are often used to help manage the flows of other rivers in the area.The stretch of the river is important for many species of fish including trout and grayling, and is tended by the members of the fishing club. They have been horrified to see the Lea dwindle to a trickle. The ecosystem on which trout and other wildlife – including protected bird species such as the bittern, shoveler and gadwall – depend requires fast-moving and clean water. Members have also been prevented from fishing at the site because of the low flow.View image in fullscreenThe ecosystem on which brown trout depend relies on fast-moving, clean water.Photograph: Liam Marsh/AlamySharkey said: “What is most extraordinary in all of this is that very government agency established to protect, conserve and ensure our river’s futures is now engaged in decimating the oldest populations of breeding brown trout in the River Lea, an act of environmental vandalism unmatched in recent history.“At a time when the regulation of our waterways is under such intense scrutiny you would assume that the Environment Agency would be desperate to do the right thing. Well, that time has come. It is now time to make sure that our rivers can and do have a bright, prosperous future. It’s time to act, it’s time to do the right thing.”The legal letter says that generally 156m litres of water used to flow each day in the Lea, but this was cut in June to 66m litres. The letter claims that on 19 June 2025, the EA reduced the flow further to 30m litres a day, before quickly bringing it back up to 66m.View image in fullscreenThe letter asks the EA to immediately cease abstraction and bring the river back to its natural flow.Photograph: Kayco/Getty ImagesWhen the flow of water drops to these low volumes, oxygen levels decline, killing off the aquatic life within. The fishery falls within a site of special scientific interest and a special protection area, so lawyers argue the EA has a legal duty to protect the river.The lawyers also say the Amwell Magna Fishery, as a holder of fishing rights in the area, is entitled to the natural flow of water in the River Lea into and through the fishery, so interference with the flow may in law be considered as nuisance, trespass or a breach of statutory duty.The letter asks the EA to immediately cease abstraction and bring the river back to its natural flow, adding: “If we do not receive a satisfactory response to this letter, we propose to advise our client to make an application for judicial review without further recourse to you.”Ricardo Gama, a partner at Leigh Day, said: “Our client is perplexed by the Environment Agency’s inexplicable decision to alter the flow of the River Lea. In our client’s view, not only has this had a devastating impact on a stretch of the river, which is an internationally designated habitat, it has put at risk a brown trout conservation project that the agency itself was running with our client.“We have now sent a judicial review pre-action letter requesting that the agency urgently restores flow to our client’s stretch of the river.”The EA has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsEnvironment AgencyRiversFishingConservationWaterHertfordshirenewsShareReuse this content"

There is a risk of thunderstorms until Wednesday, with forecast rainfall totals reaching about 50mm for Al Hudaydah region in Yemen and the Jazan province of Saudi Arabia.Although 50mm is not a particularly large rainfall total in most places, in this region it is enormous: Al Hudaydah typically records only 65mm annually, while Jazan averages about 150mm.Orographic enhancement – when air rising over mountains or other upland terrain can invigorate or produce areas of heavy rain – along the Red Sea coastal escarpments further amplifies the risk of high rainfall totals here and this, combined with the arid surface conditions, brings a significant risk of flash flooding; runoff from upland rainfall is efficiently channelled into valleys, often toward more densely populated coastal settlements.Hail and strong outflow winds are likely from these thunderstorms, with the outflow winds potentially producing short-lived but impactful intense dust storms owing to the dry desert terrain, leading to sudden reductions in visibility and localised transport disruption.While the impacts are likely to be reserved for the Red Sea coast, there is a suggestion that moisture transferred from the Arabian Sea in association with this tropical wave could extend further inland, with the potential for rare rainfall within the Rub’ al-Khali (Empty Quarter) desert.Meanwhile, Hurricane Erin tracked across the Caribbean over the weekend and is now progressing on a northward path following the US east coast. Erin underwent a rapid and significant intensification phase on Saturday, strengthening from category 1 to category 5, with US Air Force hurricane hunters recording sustained winds of 160mph.Not only is Erin the first of the five named storms this hurricane season to reach hurricane status but it jumped straight to the strongest category of storms on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Thankfully the category 5 status was short-lived, and Erin passed north of Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands on Sunday before adopting the gradual northward trajectory on Sunday night. While theBahamasand the Turks and Caicos Islands have escaped the impacts of the hurricane, many islands over the coming days are expected to face large ocean swells, strong winds and heavy rainfall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

This could have deadly consequences if people have lost faith that ambulances will be there when they need them,” said Helen Morgan MP, the Liberal Democrat health and social care spokesperson.The Lib Dems called on the government to invest £50m each year into an emergency fund to ensure community ambulance stations do not close and to recruit and train paramedics.The numbers obtained by the Lib Dems through freedom of information requests toNHStrusts showed the highest rise in Sandwell and West Birmingham, where there was a 320% increase in the number of people arriving at A&E without an ambulance compared to 2019.The numbers of people taking taxis or other forms of transport to a hospital did rely on the severity of their condition. Code 1 incidents – the most severe category for those needing immediate medical attention – saw a 24% drop in the number of people arriving without an ambulance compared to 2019.There was a rise however of 54% in code 2 incidents, where patients require urgent attention.The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives said there can be times when it was appropriate for patients to make their own way to hospital, so that those with the most severe conditions could be prioritised.“Current data proves that NHS ambulance services have never been busier answering 999 calls and responding to more patients than ever before, something that is testament to our incredibly hard-working frontline staff, as well as those handling the calls and dispatching the most appropriate clinical response to patients in greatest need,” said Anna Parry, the managing director of the AACE.Dennis Reed, the director of the Silver Voices NGO, which advocates for elderly people in Britain, said the lack of ambulance availability was caused by them having towait outside hospitalsbecause of a lack of available beds, a problem he said could be solved by investing in social care to ensure older peoplecould be cared for at home.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even once these people arrive they may face a long wait for treatment, possibly on a trolley in an overspill area, not even in A&E.“This is a truly frightening scenario for the public that diminishes their trust in the NHS and as such is a problem that should be a top priority for politicians to solve.”Explore more on these topicsNHSA&EHospitalsHealthEnglandHealth policyLiberal DemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

Shakespeare described it as “a very dangerous flat, and fatal”.In 1703, five vessels were sucked into its shifting sands during a storm, including the English warship HMS Northumberland, whichonly now is yielding its well-preserved secrets.Campaigners fear this unique area is now at risk from destructive dredging for building sand and aggregate. They are appealing to the crown estate, which owns the seabed, and calling on King Charles for support, to protect an area rich in maritime and cultural heritage.View image in fullscreenA pumping ship delivering Goodwin sand.Photograph: qaphotos.com/AlamyWriting to Charles, as a “committed conservationist, head of the armed forces and as a beneficiary of the crown estate’s commercial activities”, the Goodwin Sands Conservation Trust has asked him to encourage the crown estate to remove the sands from its list of potential marine aggregate extraction sites. The king’s public duties are paid by the sovereign grant, calculated on a percentage of crown estate profits.“Does he know where this money is coming from? It’s coming from licences to develop the seabed without proper protections for what they are going to find,” said Joanna Thomson, the trust’s chair.A response from a palace aide referred it to the crown estate. “We made clear in our letter it was because we had got nowhere with the crown estate that we were contacting the king, so the reply was rather frustrating,” said Thomson.The Goodwin Sands seabed is littered with history. As well as shipwrecks, second world war allied and axis planes crashed in the area long seen as a profitable source of marine aggregate, the trust said.Alicence to extract 2.5m tonneswas approved in 2018 for a Dover Harbour Board development, although it was eventually sourced from elsewhere. Marine aggregate extraction licences are granted by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO), but it is the crown estate that decides what development occurs on the seabed, said campaigners. They are “disappointed” at its “flat refusal” to guarantee no dredging of the 10-mile sandbank, which has had marine protected area (MPA) status since 2019, and acts as a sea defence to the unstable coastline.View image in fullscreenA ship claimed by the treacherous Goodwin Sands on the Kentish coast in 1948.Photograph: Bert Hardy/Getty ImagesHistorian and TV presenter Dan Snow, who has dived on the Goodwins, said: “There are some extraordinary wrecks down there. We are obviously all very worried and sad to think it could be just mined and a lot of that would be destroyed.”Snow described it has a “magical subsea landscape”.“Every period of our history over the last 2,000 years has left a rich legacy there, which is unusual, probably unique,” he added.The crown estate said in a statement: “There are currently no plans for aggregate licences in the Goodwin Sands area. However, we are unable to provide blanket, permanent exemptions for any part of the seabed from this or other sectors, unless predicated by an organisation with regulatory or other relevant responsibility, or by a national designation such as a highly protected marine area (HPMA).”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhile the MMO grants marine licences for dredging, the crown estate, as landowner, must license or lease the seabed and can decline to do so and not leave the matter solely to MMO marine licensing, according to Michael Williams, visiting professor of law at Plymouth University and an expert on law relating to foreshore, seabed and underwater cultural heritage.“The crown estate can’t treat it as though the Goodwins have a blanket designation, but what they can do is have a policy. You can say this is a highly sensitive archeological area and therefore we will tend not to grant applications unless there’s exceptional circumstances. And that’s what public bodies do for culturally sensitive areas all the time.”King Charles to receive £132m next year after crown estate makes £1.1bn profitRead moreHe added: “The high archaeological potential of the Goodwin Sands is, or should be, a material consideration for the crown estate, even though there is no specific designation of the area in general.” Underthe UK marine policy statement’s national policy, just because something is not specifically designated does not mean it is not of importance and the crown estate should take note of that policy, he said.The MMO is currently consulting on banning bottom trawling in certain areas, including the Goodwin marine conservation area, yet aggregate extraction is far more destructive, said Thomson.Another potential threat looms. National Grid wants to build an electricity converter station on Minster Marshes near the coast at Sandwich, with a cable running across Sandwich Bay, the site of many shipwrecks and just a few miles away from the Goodwins, “They need half a million tonnes of sand and there are fears they will wish to take it from the Goodwins,” said Thomson.WessexArchaeologyhas identified the Goodwin Sands as holding probably the highest density of maritime heritage in UK waters, said Thomson. “If a dredger went through the remains, they would be completely destroyed. Aircraft could have crew in them, so disturbing final resting places. It’s so hypocritical. Every year we have Remembrance Day at beautiful cemeteries on land, yet there’s the crown estate potentially allowing dredgers to run riot through graves, where people are buried and have drowned. It’s a psychological loss to the nation, and an emotional loss. We wouldn’t allow that to happen on land,” said Thomson.Explore more on these topicsKentKing Charles IIISecond world warCrown estateHeritageArchaeologyShareReuse this content"

I believe they’re being said because he’s not here to defend himself, as he would have done with every fibre of his being.”Sturgeon’s political partnership with her predecessor as first minister, whodied suddenly of a heart attack last Octoberat the age of 69, dominates her memoir, Frankly, which was published last week.She describes tensions that existed between them long before their catastrophic falling out over her government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against him, claiming that he opposed equal marriage, overrode her concerns about releasing the Lockerbie bomber and had several extramarital affairs.The former Scottish National party leader stood trial in 2020 on 13 counts of sexual assault and was cleared of all charges, although a pattern of bullying and inappropriate behaviour towards younger female staff emerged in court.Asked what she believed was motivating Sturgeon, Hendry said: “There’s been a number of years that these things could have been said, and the timing of it now where she’s released a book and is looking to publicise that, I think many people have thought that could be the case.”Sturgeon writes in Frankly that she “agonised” about “stirring up pain for [Salmond’s] wife and family” but concluded “I cannot let what he said stand unchallenged”.She addresses in detail the theory espoused by Salmond before his death that the harassment allegations were part of a conspiracy confected by Sturgeon’s inner circle – but then advances her own theory that Salmond himself may have leaked the initial revelations to the Daily Record, a claim immediately rejected by the journalist who broke the story.Her treatment of Salmond in the memoir drew immediate fire from his allies last week, with some demanding retraction and an apology to his widow, Moira.On Sunday, Moira Salmond revealed she had instructed lawyers to continue her late husband’s legal action against the Scottish government over its botched handling of the investigation into the original sexual harassment allegations. She was reportedly galvanised by the claims made in Frankly.Hendry said: “Our family are most definitely united on continuing the things that my uncle started before he passed. As a family, we are very close and we’re very strong and we will continue to do anything we need to do to defend his name.”She also confirmed her plans to run for Holyrood next year for Alba, the party set up by Salmond in 2021 after he quit the SNP, which challenged its failure to deliver a second independence referendum.“I intend to stand to both honour my uncle’s legacy, but also because I understand a lot of frustrations that rural communities like the north-east have.”Explore more on these topicsAlex SalmondNicola SturgeonScottish National party (SNP)Scottish politicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Lungu’s family said he had specifically requested that Hichilema not attend his funeral.On 8 August, the Pretoria high court ruled that Lungu’s body could be sent back toZambiafor a state funeral. Lungu’s older sister Bertha broke down, shouting across the courtroom at Kabesha as she was restrained by other relatives.Lungu’s family then applied for leave to appeal. On Monday, the high court adjourned the case indefinitely while South Africa’s constitutional court decides whether to hear the appeal.Meanwhile, conspiracy theories have spread, from rumours that Lungu is not actually dead to speculation that Hichilema wants to use the body for witchcraft.Many Zambians have joked about the saga. “It’s coming home!” Kodwani Banda, a self-described “youth advocate”,postedto his 356,000 Facebook followers, with an image of white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney.Emmanuel Mwamba, a spokesperson for the Patriotic Front, Lungu’s party, said: “There should have been more sympathy. When [government officials] came to South Africa, they were just interested in picking up the body and holding the funeral. It was very mechanical. Their approach lacked sympathy, lacked empathy, lacked a sense of Africanness, a sense ofubuntu.”Kabesha had previously argued that a state funeral with full military honours was a legal requirement, citing a court ruling on the burial of Zambia’s first president, Kenneth Kaunda. “The moment that a national mourning is declared, the law kicks in,” hetoldthe Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation in June.Mwamba responded that a state funeral could be held without the current president presiding over it. “His presence doesn’t make it. A state funeral is, in fact, the protocols such as the gun salute, the pallbearers being soldiers, the ceremony being handled by the defence forces,” he said.Sishuwa Sishuwa, a political historian and senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University, said the burial dispute had heightened political discord in Zambia.“The faultlines have always been there, but the dispute over Lungu’s burial place has exacerbated the country’s regional and political polarisation,” he said. “Whatever way the dispute is resolved, it will have a significant bearing on the 2026 elections … A key reason behind the government’s court action in South Africa is to reduce the political costs of burying Lungu in exile.”Lungu ruled Zambia from 2015 to 2021, having taken over when Michael Sata died in office. He defeated Hichilema in the 2016 presidential election, which Hichilema and his United Party for National Development (UPND) party claimed was rigged.The following year, Hichilema was sent to prison to await trial on treason charges after his convoy did not give way to Lungu’s presidential motorcade. Four months later, after an international outcry, he was released and the charges were dropped.Hichilema finallydefeated Lunguin the 2021 elections, amid an economic crisis. Since then, he has been accused of using oppressive methods similar to those of his longtime rival.In 2023,police stopped Lungu from going out for runs, saying they were “political activism” that had to be approved in advance to “ensure public safety”. His wife and children have faced corruption charges, which they have denied and said were politically motivated.In 2024, Lungu was banned from running in next year’s presidential election by the constitutional court, whichruledthat the period from when Lungu took office in 2015 until the 2016 election counted as a full first term.Explore more on these topicsZambiaSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Musk tweeted: “Torturing AI is not OK.”Anthropic’s announcement comes amid a debate over AI sentience. Critics of the booming AI industry, such as the linguist Emily Bender, say LLMs are simply “synthetic text-extruding machines” which force huge training datasets “through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it.”It is a position that has recently led some in the AI world to start calling chatbots “clankers”.But other experts, such as Robert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness,have saidbasic moral decency dictates that “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.Some researchers, like Chad DeChant, at Columbia University,have advocated care should be takenbecause when AIs are designed with longer memories, stored information could be used in ways which lead to unpredictable and potentially undesirable behaviour.Others have argued that curbing sadistic abuse of AIs matters to safeguard against human degeneracy rather than to limit any suffering of an AI.Anthropic’s decision comes after ittested Claude Opus 4 to see how it responded to task requestsvaried by difficulty, topic, type of task and the expected impact (positive, negative or neutral). When it was given the opportunity to respond by doing nothing or ending the chat, its strongest preference was against carrying out harmful tasks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he cautioned that it remained unclear what, if any, moral thought exists behind the character that AIs play when they are responding to a user based on the vast training data they have been fed and the ethical guidelines they have been instructed to follow.He said Anthropic’s decision also risked deluding some users that the character they are interacting with is real, when “what remains really unclear is what lies behind the characters”. There have been several reports of people harming themselves based on suggestions made by chatbots, includingclaims that a teenager killed himselfafter being manipulated by a chatbot.Birch previously warned of “social ruptures” in societybetween people who believe AIs are sentient and those who treat them like machines.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingShareReuse this content"

One who made me smile is Alex O’Neill in Dublin company CoisCéim Dance Theatre’sDancehall Blues. He’s the highlight of an underpowered piece of dance theatre, a duet set in a (somewhat apocalyptic) society in crisis, about rediscovering the importance of human connection. O’Neill brings the material to life with character and charm, pouncing on the steps, his movement muscular and vernacular, with sensitivity and bite.Her show has already ended, but Sarah Aviaja Hammeken is absolutely one to watch out for in the future, an award-winning Danish dancer/choreographer whose soloSoilis about her Greenlandic heritage. The work felt like it could be further developed, but every time Hammeken danced I was engrossed in the instinctive expressiveness and gravity of her movement, the feeling of someone working things out, physically and mentally, a fluent conversation between mind and body.Solitude Without Loneliness review – bad dates, frenzied flyering and the spirit of the fringeRead moreKennedy Junior Muntanga is another utterly compelling mover, a dancer of immense, intense power and finesse, but one who seems almost resistant to give us what he’s good at. In his experimental soloAkropolis I, there’s even a line where he seemingly admonishes himself under his breath: “Just dance!” Akropolis I was a late addition to the fringe and shows Muntanga still struggling with what he wants to say and how, but he’ll be well worth seeing when he works it out.Honourable mention for an acrobat who is also clearly a great dancer with a distinctive physical style: Ange Viaud from new company Copenhagen Collective, who debutedThe Genesis, a large-scale acrobatics show in the mode of festival favesCircaorGravity and Other Myths(the show is three-star good with tons of potential). Viaud shows precision gymnastic prowess and b-boy flair, but also has a wildness about him, as if anything could happen next.View image in fullscreenCheeky and entertaining … Sixº by Flip Fabrique.Photograph: Cédric MéravillesFrom the sample of shows I dipped into this year, it’s hard to spot trends across the dance (and circus/physical theatre) programme, except perhaps a sense of mild disappointment and the feeling no one’s had quite enough rehearsal time to develop their ideas. Often shows are frustrating because you can see there’s some great talent or material there but it’s just not working. Case in point, Canadian company We All Fall Down, whose last fringe show,Papillon, was very well regarded. They returned this year with something much more personal.Because You Never Askedis based on a recording of co-director Roger White talking to his Jewish grandmother, who escaped from Germany in 1939, to Edinburgh. The stories of growing up amid the rise of nazism, of Hitler visiting Hamburg, of friends being taken from their homes, have huge inbuilt power that is completely drowned out at times by a soundtrack that competes in frequency, and the distraction of dance that seems wilfully at odds with the text. The music has a thriller-ish tone of percussive booms and nerves-on-edge strings that is entirely unnecessary – we all know the underlying horror. It’s a bombardment that undermines the strength of the source material.Elsewhere, some underwhelming circus-theatre from Quebec’s Flip Fabrique inSix°. Contrary to the current vogue for stripped-back circus, this one comes with a theatrical setting and quirky characters. What that setting is and who those characters are isn’t totally clear, and there’s a moral brewing but the big reveal never really comes. Nevertheless, it’s genial entertainment with some cheeky acrobats prone to silly dancing.In the Bushes review – a fun and fearful walk on the wild sideRead moreAlso a little underwhelming, homegrown company BarrowlandBalletaddressed the topic of the moment, masculinity, inWee Man, particularly as it applies to teenage boys – there were four of them in this production and very good they were, too. The show felt a bit like it was in its workshop stages and while it was very warm and well-meaning, there was nothing too surprising in the ideas offered about what it supposedly takes to be a man, even if the quotes no doubt come from real life: don’t cry; if you can’t be popular, be funny; be strong, be right, be aggressive. Having said that, there were a couple of Scottish references that raised a laugh: “Always walk as if you’re wearing a sporran full of porridge”, and the rule of summer, apt for the heatwave outside – “When it hits 16 degrees, taps aff!”View image in fullscreenHot topic … Barrowland Ballet’s Wee Man.Photograph: Viktoria BeggStill, there were surprise finds at the festival, too. Like a sweet kids show from Revel PuckCircus,TheUgly Duckling, all about embracing your differences, which has a lot of knowing lines for the adults, too. Then the two-handerGo!from company Corps In Situ, a martial arts duet that’s beautifully choreographic in its sense of rhythm, pace, attack and grace. The performers have absolute physical command and focus but there’s playfulness and humour, too. It’s a short (40-minute) show that’s skilful and satisfying.Scoring high for likability factor is TS Crew from Hong Kong, who inNo Sugar No Milkcombined hip-hop, beatbox, martial arts, circus and a lot of physical humour in silly skits, set in a Hong Kong cafe. The high jinks of the slightly hapless staff involved low-stakes antics like running scared from a toy mouse and artfully chucking packing boxes around.Mary, Queen of Scots review – bold ballet brings the royal courts bang up to dateRead moreFinally, gently transporting us away from the chaos of Edinburgh’s rammed streets is Mele Broomes’s daydreamyThrough Warm Temperatures, part of the Made in Scotland showcase. (Even local artists can barely afford to perform at the festival these days without being part of an official showcase, and the dance and circus programmes are dominated by international groups.) The piece is like a hypnotic ritual, the company of dancers/singers led by Broomes bathed in low light in shades of purple, magenta and blue. Cellist/composer Simone Seales sits at the back of the stage looping riffs to set up a lulling vibe; dancers’ feet pad side to side in a repetitive sway; there’s a shoulder massage, the sheen of castor oil on the performers’ skin catching the light. A voice intones: “I search inside myself to forgive myself … no shame.” It’s a ritual for healing and self-acceptance, and a world I wanted to be absorbed inside.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsDancehall Blues is atAssembly @ Dance Baseuntil 24 August.

As European festivals ban them, the finest one in Wales – arguably the UK – has kept the Irish trio on the bill, and their combination of druggy lairyness, larky republicanism and very serious pro-Palestinian solidarity, combined with mic technique a jungle MC might envy, makes for an explosive start. Some of the hip-hop numbers are corny – a sort of Fresh Prince of Belfast – but over trap and rave they’re peerlessly thrilling.Their set gives Green Man an undeniable shot of vitality, as does a set byCMATas the Irish star enters pop’s stratosphere, off the back of TikTok virality and aeuphoric Glasto set. Namechecking Welsh legends Catatonia, Shirley Bassey, H from Steps and Tom Jones, it feels as if she needs a Jones-style TV variety show to house her entertainment prowess: the songs have country homeliness but Stevie Nicks-style arena mysticism; her banter is silly but topped with political spikes as she passionately celebrates Wales’s preservation of their national language. It all earns her possibly the biggest main stage crowd this festival has ever seen.Folk-rock and indie-rock have long been Green Man’s bread and butter, and the triumphant breadth of those styles is on full show. Caroline’s emotional blend of art rock and midwest emo, their songTotal Euphoriadelivering just that;Jasmine.4.t’s alt-rock songs of dissociating in supermarkets and “the healing power of transsexual love”, which already feel like classics;MJ Lenderman’s euphoric southern US rock, the result of what might happen if Neil Young and Lynyrd Skynyrd kissed and made up; and a spellbinding tribute to Bob Dylan from folk collectiveBroadside Hacks. Renditions of Maggie’s Farm and Like a Rolling Stone are a bit broad – it turns out youcansing Dylan out of tune – but his early folk material is stirringly performed by Dan MacDonald (AKA Spitzer Space Telescope) andClara Mann, and how trenchant the savagely ironic militarism of With God on Our Side still feels.View image in fullscreenOne of the best live bands in the world right now … YHWH Nailgun at Green Man 2025.Photograph: Nici EberlBeyond those core styles, the festival feels more socially and musically diverse than ever. There’s a global remit with acts from DRC’sFulu Mizikito German-Turkish-ledDerya Yildirim & Grup ŞimşekandIndia’s Asha Puthli, distilled aura emanating from the latter as she grooves over light disco and shares memories of drag queens and Andy Warhol. The Friday lunchtime set from South African vocal quintet the Joy feels like God pointing at us from a cloudless sky: unfeasibly beautiful harmonising, including dubstep-worthy bass penetration from their lowest voice.View image in fullscreenExhorting us to better ourselves …Joshua Idehan at Green Man 2025.Photograph: Oli ChapmanAs the styles expand further outward, Underworld are the most banging act to ever headline here, Karl Hyde’s dance moves rivalling those of an oiled and shirtless podium dancer in 90s Ibiza, and Bicep side project Dove rolls around techno, speed garage and UK bass in a juggernaut of digital noise.US rapper Mike unspools soliloquiesover subaquatic beats but there’s plenty of crowd participation – and even a dance contest – to keep it populist. And New York no-waversYHWH Nailgunare simply one of the best live bands in the world right now, their constantly mutating funk setting off three concurrent styles of dancing in the crowd: pogoing, salsa and dub skanking.There are shortcomings: so many songs in Wet Leg’s headline set are powered by the same four-to-the-floor stomp and while they have a genuine rock star in front person Rhian Teasdale, they don’t have the melodic invention to stop it feeling samey – a problem also faced by rising bandDivorce, whose songs wander aimlessly. Smashing up a malfunctioning amp at the end,Wunderhorseevidently feel their set is a disaster – “if there’s a God, well fuck him” is the reaction offront person Jacob Slaterhalfway through – but it actually sounds terrific out front, and the on-stage difficulties bring out something febrile and desperate in Slater’s singing. There is only one actual clunker: John Grant underselling a 24-carat golden hour by singing almost a full semitone flat for song after song.Nevertheless, Green Man’s batting average is still at a world-beating level, and its valley setting feels like a temporary utopia. Trans rights are frequently championed, and affirmations of Palestine’s right to freedom are voiced by everyone fromNilüfer YanyatoBeen Stellarand closing headlinersTV on the Radio, who acknowledge “monstrous” behaviour in the world but who meet it with a steadfast belief in something better, that “love is the province of the brave” as one song has it. That belief, combined with the festival’s blessedly anti-corporate feel, combines euphorically at the star-making set of the weekend fromJoshua Idehen: a poet, musician, comedian, therapist and a kind of motivational speaker exhorting us to better ourselves. He instructs us to find “a joy with nothing to sell you”, something in abundance at Green Man.Explore more on these topicsGreen ManFestivalsMusic festivalsIndiePop and rockRapKneecapreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its director relives a January shoot hampered by hailstones, flash floods and frozen moorsLanre BakareMon 18 Aug 2025 03.00 EDTShare‘The Yorkshire Dales are at their most alive when it’s really miserable and horrible,” says Jack King, director of award-winning British independent film The Ceremony. It’s the story of carwash workers from Bradford who end up in the countryside nearthe quaint village of Kettlewellas they carry out a grim mission with a corpse. “It’s a weird liminal space,” adds King. “It’s dead. It’s barren. There are no trees anywhere. It’s not like the tea-cosy version. It can be a really nasty place.”Shot over 12 frigid January days in 2023, on a tiny budget of £120,000, The Ceremony was hampered by hailstones, flash floods and cold snaps that froze the moors and made carefully scouted locations inaccessible. Scenes were scrapped and layers hastily put on as cast and crew hunkered down in the local pub that served as their base. King says he embraced the elements and channelled a certain German director,whose struggles with on-set disasters are legendary. “I just wanted to be Werner Herzog,” he says. “The worse the weather and circumstances, the better the art.”People say: ‘I really love the film – but what’s that goat about?'King’s novel approach to Dales mythology has landed well with audiences: the film wonthe inaugural Sean Connery prize at last summer’s Edinburgh film festival. It was a helpful leg-up for King who has been making short films in his home town of Bradford for two decades. He has also forged a partnership withthe band To Kill a King, for whom he craftedhalf a dozen inventive music videos. The Ceremony is a different proposition entirely, a bold debut feature about some of the most talked about but voiceless people in the UK: migrant workers, specifically those who work inthe shady world of hand carwashes.View image in fullscreen‘I just wanted to be Werner Herzog’ … The Ceremony director Jack King, centre, during filming.Photograph: Finn VarneyIt’s been a decade in the making, King says. After working on a short film about a dysfunctional hand carwash, he wanted to go deeper in a longer format. “I went all aroundBradford,” he says, “trying to get anyone to talk to me, which was quite hard, because they were like, ‘What do you want? This is weird.’ So I got an interpreter, which produced slightly better results. She was a feisty Romanian who would boss them about like she was their mum.”Supported by this no-nonsense interpreter from Harehills in Leeds, King slowly earned the trust of the people who worked in carwashes and began to gain insights into their lives. “They were talking about other stuff,” he says. “A lot of them were quite religious. People had very strong philosophical ideas. They had dreams and aspirations. It wasn’t just like, ‘Oh God, my boss is a crook and I’m scared of him and my life’s shit.’ There’s a lot more to it.”The fact that King got anyone to speak is remarkable. Abuse isrife in the sectorand the fates of workers are often in the hands of capricious bosses. Research in 2022 revealed that more than90% of hand carwashesare likely to be employing workers illegally, despite government schemes totackle such abuse.During his own research, King discovered a world dominated by Romanians and Kurds who found themselves in places such as Dewsbury in WestYorkshire. “There was an interesting divide,” he says. “They wouldn’t really speak to each other. Basically, white and brown were separated.”This is the tension at the core of The Ceremony. The carwash’s Romanian middle manager (Cristi, played by Tudor Cucu-Dumitrescu) and his underling, a taciturn Kurdish man called Yusuf (Erdal Yildiz), have to dispose of a body, as personal and cultural differences cause potentially fatal clashes. Cucu-Dumitrescu and Yildiz are two of just a handful of professional actors in the film. Most of the supporting cast were discovered in carwashes around West Yorkshire.View image in fullscreenTension … Tudor Cucu-Dumitrescu as Cristi, front, and Erdal Yildiz as Yusuf.Photograph: Cosmosquare FilmsThe Ceremony might look and sound likeclassic Brit-grit: dark images of a wet and weary industrial city complemented by a story about struggle. It might also seem like a political film, a Loachian response to the constant negativity from the far right and the rightwing press about migrants. But it isn’t quite what it seems. The miserable Yorkshire weather and Bradford’s dark streets give it a recognisable aesthetic but there’s also a magical goat that appears later on, one that has thrilled and baffled early audiences in equal measure. The small black creature has dominated post-screening Q&As. “People say, ‘I really love the film, blah, blah blah – but what’s that goat about?” says King.King also describes the film as an allegory – and there is clearly some magical realism in the mix too, as unlikely bedfellows Cristi and Yusuf complete what is essentially a quest in the Yorkshire countryside. As the weather closes in, the worst sides of human nature come to the fore. “I wanted to make something that shows people with all their contradictions,” says King. “That’s the problem with a lot of films that just see migrants as victims or criminals. Especially now, you should be allowed to be both of those things – and something else in the middle.” The dark side of the Dales has never looked as good.The Ceremony is in UK cinemas from 22 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsYorkshireMigrationBradfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Screenwriter Alan O’Gorman and first-time director and story co-creator Brendan Canty deliver a social-realist film with heart, featuring outstanding performances of sympathy and strength, developed from Canty’s 2019 short film of the same name. It’s tough, but capable of delicacy and succeeds in conveying something very difficult to achieve without sentimentality: love of your home town. You can come for the drama and stay for the cheeky hip-hop sequence over the closing credits, a final stretch of sweetness and fun that the movie has more than earned, and which Canty, a former music video director, is more than capable of putting together.Shane (Diarmuid Noyes) is a young guy once in care, but turning his life around in Cork with wife Stacey (Emma Willis), a baby and a painting-and-decorating business. It is now Shane’s grim task to deal with his younger half-brother Christy (Danny Power), a seething, glowering 17-year-old who has just lost his place with a foster family in Ballincollig on the other side of town owing to an ugly scrap, a video of which is going viral on social media. So Shane brings him back and lets him live in his place for a while on the understanding that he will soon move back out, probably into a grim hostel.Christy finds that people around the neighbourhood remember him, as they do his late mother – but Christy himself does not remember them, having perhaps suppressed these painful childhood memories. Slowly but surely, Christy begins to fit in. It turns out that fighting isn’t all that he’s good at: he has an unlikely talent for cutting hair, which becomes the talk of the town, especially when he gives a trim to local kid Robot (a nice performance from real-life Cork rapper Jamie “the King” Forde). But he is also in danger of being drawn into the orbit of his scary criminal cousins, and Shane realises that the threat of that hostel might be driving Christy into their arms.Where another type of movie might have a gravitational pull towards disaster and despair, this one doesn’t; equally, though, it’s under no illusions. There’s always a heartbeat of humour, especially when Christy helps out with painting jobs; he and dopey fellow painter Trevor (Chris Walley) can’t resist weighing themselves on a well-off client’s hi-tech digital scales in his bathroom – synced to the client’s Fitbit, which then goes crazy. It’s a smart, likable picture.Christy screened at theEdinburgh film festival, and is out in Ireland and Northern Ireland on 29 August, and the rest of the UK on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsIrelandEdinburgh film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was worth the waitEllen E JonesMon 18 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 00.02 EDTShareIt’s taken nearly 20 years for the American reality franchise to wind its way across the Atlantic to the capital. In the meantime, there were pretenders and near-misses –Ladies of London,Real Housewives of Cheshire– but now, finally, west London’s ex-model community has a viable retirement plan.The delay seems all the more inexplicable, when you consider how to the manner born – if not to themanorborn – these ladies are. Take Amanda, who lives in Belgravia, drives a Bentley convertible, runs an underperforming luxury beauty brand and is in a co-dependent relationship with her poodle-cum-stylist, Monty. Amanda has it all –clearly– and in the first episode’s first five minutes, she cements her status as RHOL’s Queen Bee by saying: “I’m actually a really private person.” Direct to camera. On a reality TV show. With a straight face. Nowthat’sa Real Housewife.It’s all about being “real”, you see – in the sense of being fake, but in areallycommitted way. The “house” bit also matters. Hence, we’re introduced to every cast member with a property-porn interiors montage (a slow-pan of the walk-in bag/shoe closet is the obligatory third or fourth shot). To a lesser extent, the “wife” bit is also important. That’s why, and no offence to the one from Wham who’s not George Michael, but Amanda is going to need to accrue some more impressive ex-husbands if she hopes to secure her top spot for many more series to come. I’m rooting for you, babe. We’re all rooting for you.All except RHOL’s five other cast members. They’re not rooting for you, Amanda. They’re perfectly poised to snatch the crown, should it ever slip. And, as befits a city full of history, some of these society girls go back.Wayback. Like, all the way back to “when Annabel’s first opened”, which should lend a certain “heritage” texture to their feuding.There are two Juliets, at least one of whom rides horses in Hyde Park and has a husband named Tiggy. Indeed, with such aristo bona fides, one might think it unnecessary to further signpost your status ambitions by dressing up for the confessional in a royal insignia and ruffs, like a Poundland Elizabeth I. But perhaps this was done for the benefit of Juliet M’s nemesis, Panthea, whose husband, a lowly lawyer, has recently been made “Master of the Solicitors” as a “prestige thing” (never heard of it).In London, we’re told, “wealth whispers”. That’s in contrast to the outrageous overconsumption of OG Real Housewives like Teresa Giudice and Jen Shah – both convicted fraudsters – from the New Jersey and Salt Lake City shows, respectively. In practice, it’s investment banker turned baker Nessie wiggling her eyebrows suggestively, while saying things like “We were in a very …comfortableposition, let’s say”. Or describing her husband’s line of work as “entrepreneur in the mining industry”, which is certainly one of the more transparent euphemisms for “earthly emissary from hell’s 9th circle” that I’ve heard lately.None of this rises to the level of the class analysis or psychological insight that we’ve come to expect from the franchise at its finest, but happily there’s still time for deeper themes to develop. And happily there’s also Karen, from Jamaica via Jersey, whose main function on the show is cracking up at the foolishness of these Englishwomen, while delivering teeth-kissing side-eye, as only a posh Jamaican can.View image in fullscreen‘It will be carnage in there’ … Amanda Cronin.Photograph: PRWith chaos agents like these on the guest-list, Amanda is quite right to brace for trouble ahead of her International Women’s Day soiree: “This loo needs to be checked every 15 minutes,” she tells her housekeeper sternly. “Remember. Because it will becarnagein there.” Ominous … But maybe Beluga caviar has some digestive side-effects which are well-known in society circles? Or is it the Ozempic?In the event, RHOL’s inaugural bust-up happens outside the downstairs loo, after Panthea made a toast that was 10% empty girl boss platitudes and 90% shady digs at Juliet.God bless Panthea, the only one vulgar enough to break that “wealth whispers” omertà and put a price-tag on her bragging. She once dropped a cool £140,000 in a single Harrods trip, she says, which “back then is equivalent to 300-and-something thousand”. I’ve done the maths, and this dates Panthea’s spree to some point in 1963 – around the same time private members’ club Annabel’s opened, in fact. So either they’re all time-travelling vampires, let loose on one of Nessie’s husband’s Hellmouth expeditions or – good news, girls – the botox really works!The Real Housewives of London is on Hayu.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

That film isHighlander, the stylised but strangely lofty 1986 wannabe blockbuster with a premise so ridiculous – immortals tussle throughout human history in a beheading battle royale – it is often deployed as a pop culture punchline. (In the Nascar comedyTalladega Nights: the Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Will Ferrell’s blowhard racer confidently asserts that Highlander won the Academy Award for “best movie ever made”.)‘Nothing else quite like it’: why DEBS is my feelgood movieRead moreEven Highlander’sproduction historysounds like a mistranslated joke about national stereotypes walking into a bar. Australian director Russell Mulcahy chose French-American actor Christopher Lambert to embody the titular mythic Scottish hero, then cast actual mythic Scottish hero Sean Connery as his preening Egyptian turned Spaniard mentor. But the key to unlocking the mood-improving pleasures of Mulcahy’s offbeat epic is not to stress too much about the arcane mythology or hopscotching chronology. For all its sweeping romanticism about love and loss down the centuries, it is a film suffused with a quirky self-awareness beneath the 1980s music video sheen.Of course, if you are actually Scottish then Highlander has probably always felt like a comedy. The handsomely mounted historical flashback scenes that begin in 1538 show the bawdy bustle of Highland life on the banks of a bonny loch. But when Lambert’s strapping young warrior Connor MacLeod seems to come back from the dead – shrugging off a brutal battlefield impaling by burly baddie the Kurgan (Clancy Brown) – his clan turns against him with a manic zeal worthy of Monty Python. “He’s in league with Lucifer!” screams Connor’s formerly coy sweetheart Kate (Celia Imrie) as he is violently ejected from their village.In the present day of 1985, the rough-hewn Highlander MacLeod has evolved into slick New York antiques dealer Russell Nash, the beneficiary of over 400 years of life experience and one crash course in the esoteric rules of being an immortal from Connery’s dandyish charmer Ramirez. The accumulated psychological weight of those centuries feels palpable when MacLeod broods alone in a secret sanctum stacked with keepsakes, or noses an ancient brandy and drifts off into a reverie remembering the year that Mozart composed his Great Mass. But there is mirth amid the melancholy. When MacLeod notices a tacky illustration of a kilted Scot, he stares straight into the camera and offers a knowing eyebrow waggle worthy of Groucho Marx.New York is the backdrop for the fabled Gathering, where immortals must congregate for a bloodthirsty conclave that will leave only one to claim the mystical Prize. It ends up being a spectacular rematch between MacLeod and the Kurgan on the roof of Silvercup Studios in Queens (neither the Kurgan nor the famous Silvercup sign survive the encounter). That climactic sword battle – with its eerie, swirling optical effects that signify the Quickening, a sort of magical defibrillator of immortal energy – was easily the high point of Highlander on my initial viewings.But now the narrative arc has become so familiar I luxuriate in the weird details and eccentric characters in the margins: the fish flopping out of MacLeod’s kilt as he emerges bedraggled from a loch; the sarcastic hotdog vendor making fun of the New York cops baffled by a sudden outbreak of decapitations; the unmistakably towering Kurgan turning up with a newly shaved head and purring: “I’m in disguise!”Even the ultimate Prize turns out to be a sly cosmic joke. It grants MacLeod the superpower of being able to read the minds of everyone on the planet, nominally equipping him to usher in a new spirit of global cooperation between “presidents, diplomats and scientists”. But it also makes him mortal and finally able to father a child. For the lonely MacLeod, newly hooked up with foxy metallurgist Brenda (Roxanne Hart), it is all he could have wished for. But it’s worth noting that if the despicable Kurgan had triumphed he would have had all of humanity inanely chattering in his head while he grappled with his own impending death. That would have been pretty funny too.The snarky criticism most often levelled at Highlander is that the film’s signature battle cry – “There can be only one!” – was soon undercut by a parade of wobbly movie sequels and a surprisingly durable TV spin-off. A long-in-the-works cinematic reboot from the John Wick director Chad Stahelski with Henry Cavill attached to star is rumoured to begin shooting later this year and the temptation will surely be to leave the 1980s visual stylings behind and amp up the violence. But if Stahelski and Cavill genuinely want to honour the charming spirit of the original they should consider updating the mantra: there can be only fun.Highlander is available on Amazon Prime in the US and is rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsFilmMy feelgood movieAction and adventure filmsSean ConneryScience fiction and fantasy filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Born in Mantua around 1536, he became something of a musical propagandist for the regime, touring his ambitious choral works around Europe as a kind of composer-cum-diplomat in the hope that their acoustical magnificence would sway hearts and minds in his bosses’ favour. The pièce de résistance was his monumental Missa Sopra Ecco Sì Beato Giorno, a mass setting for 40 to 60 voices, rediscovered in 2005 having been lost for 400 years.Striggio’s mass was the centrepiece of this imaginative concert recreating the kind of liturgical event visitors to late Renaissance Florence might have been lucky enough to catch. Opening with theatrical flair, instrumentalists and singers filed on stage to a plainchant in praise of the Virgin Mary. The shift from salty medieval harmonies to the opulent warmth of Orazio Benevolo’s Laetatus Sum signalled the riches to come.View image in fullscreenHervé Niquet conducts  Le Concert Spirituel at the BBC Proms 2025.Photograph: Mark Allan/BBCLe Concert Spirituel, founded by Hervé Niquet in 1987, has form in this repertoire, having made an outstanding recording of much of this music. That said, it was surely a misstep for the musicians to perform in a closed circle on the Royal Albert Hall stage. While doubtless radio-friendly, with only a quarter of the singers facing out and another quarter presenting their backs to most of the audience, not only did balance become an issue, it was hard not to feel shut out of what should have been an immersive experience.Music in 40 parts can be exposing for individual voices. Nevertheless, the Striggio worked its magic, especially in the supersized Agnus Dei and the flamboyant Osanna in Excelsis where voices tumbled over each other with joyful abandon. Even better were the Benevolo works, including a superb Magnificat where verses were interspersed with instrumental ensembles. Palestrina motets played on sackbuts, a practice typical of the time, lent a touch of authenticity, and there were some choice rarities, including Domenico Massenzio’s frisky female-voice Filiae Jerusalem. A 40-part Striggio motet rounded off the evening with a sumptuous anticipation of paradise.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

The protagonist, Maxine Tarnow, mother of two, longsuffering partner to a feckless financier, finds herself chasing shadows around Manhattan’s Silicon Alley. Maxine’s skills as a fraud investigator are put to the test unravelling the machinations of the nasty controller of a computer security firm who will do anything to get his hands on a virtual reality simulator called DeepArcher (geddit?). There are plentiful puns, red herrings and surnames that serve as possibly unhelpful acronyms – the usual Pynchon ingredients, in other words. Here they fail to cohere into an entirely satisfying whole.Typical line“Paranoia’s the garlic in life’s kitchen … you can never have too much.”Pynchon tropesPastiche songs, sex, historical eventsView image in fullscreen6Vineland(1990)It is 1984, the year of Reagan’s re-election but for Zoyd Wheeler, Los Angeles-based veteran of the radical left, time has stopped. His wife, Frenesi, has left him to raise their daughter, Prairie, alone and he resorts to dismal acts of self-sabotage in order to qualify for government benefits. Prairie, in turn, flees the family coop to track down her mother, a subversive turned informant in league with federal baddy Brock Vond. Pynchon’s themes are prescient – surveillance, media saturation, generational miscommunication – but his aim is off.Typical line“If patterns of ones and zeros were ‘like’ patterns of human lives and deaths, if everything about an individual could be represented in a computer record by a long string of ones and zeros, then what kind of creature would be represented by a long string of lives and deaths.”Pynchon tropesSex, drugs, anagramsView image in fullscreen5V.(1963)Sincerity is not a quality readily associated with Pynchon, but his debut novel displays an affection for his characters that would later take second place to irony. The story bounces between Benny Profane, unemployed sailor, and Herbert Stencil, obsessive seeker of the elusive V. The language shows its age in places, but the plight of people determined to keep themselves in the dark is as relevant as ever.Typical line“Perhaps history this century … is rippled with gathers in its fabric such that if we are situated, as Stencil seemed to be, at the bottom of a fold, it’s impossible to determine warp, woof or pattern anywhere else.”Pynchon tropesPastiche songs, sex, real-life eventsView image in fullscreen4The Crying of Lot 49(1966)The author regretted publishing this novel but he was being unduly harsh on himself. Short, funny and shot through with allusions you can choose to follow or ignore, the story of Oedipa Maas’s search for the meaning behind the supposed rivalry of postal companies is the literary equivalent of non-Euclidean geometry.Typical line“Oedipa wondered whether, at the end of this (if it were supposed to end), she too might not be left with only compiled memories of clues, announcements, intimations, but never the central truth itself.”Pynchon tropesSex, pastiche songsView image in fullscreen3Inherent Vice(2009)Wilfully weird, often sordid and occasionally borderline unintelligible, Pynchon’s seventh novel wasadapted for the big screenby Paul Thomas Anderson in 2014. The adaptation was nominated for an Oscar, making Pynchon as mainstream as he’s ever likely to get. Larry “Doc” Sportello is a private investigator with a broken heart and a huge appetite for marijuana. His ex-girlfriend reappears out of nowhere, implores Doc to find her married lover, then promptly vanishes again. At the heart of the murky tale lurks the sinister presence of the Golden Fang, a vessel that means, as Doc surmises, “a lot of things to a lot of people” – all of them unsavoury.Typical line“‘What,’ Doc wondered aloud, ‘the fuck is going on here?’”Pynchon tropesDrugs, sex, rock’n’rollView image in fullscreen2Gravity’s Rainbow(1973)This kaleidoscopic tour de force cemented Pynchon’s reputation as a writer of baffling, farcical and profound genius. A chief delight is his brilliant ear for dialogue which is given full rein in this twisted tale of allied intelligence officers, Nazis, scientists and seers united by a MacGuffin in the shape of a mysterious rocket. The action arcs from London under bombardment to a postwar zone of surrender. What is striking is how the themes explored here – forever wars, technological domination, uncontrollable cartels – have become staples of internet discourse.Typical line“A screaming comes across the sky. It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now.”Pynchon tropesSex, pastiche songs, real-life eventsView image in fullscreen1Mason & Dixon(1997)Pynchon gives the 18th-century novel a postmodern twist to explore the relationship between Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, British surveyors tasked with ending a boundary dispute between the colonies of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Delaware. The Mason-Dixon line would later mark the division between free and slave states in the US.The author layers fact over anachronistic fiction, scientific inquiry over conspiratorial rumour, and tragedy over knockabout farce, in a virtuoso display of storytelling. There are walk-on parts for Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. A further conceit lies in the narration of events by the Reverend Wicks Cherrycoke, many years after they supposedly took place. It is a ripping yarn spun for the incredulous enjoyment of both the cleric’s family and the grateful reader.Typical line“For if each Star is little more a mathmatikal Point, located upon the Hemisphere of Heaven by Right Ascension and Declination, then all the Stars, taken together, tho’ innumerable, must like any other set of points, in turn represent some single gigantick Equation, to the mind of God as straightforward as, say, the Equation of a Sphere, – to us unreadable, incalculable.”Pynchon tropesPastiche songs, historical eventsTo explore any of the books featured, visitguardianbookshop.com.

He had recently been released from prison, where he had been held after his critiques of corruption and inequality had touched a nerve among leaders of the recently independent nation. But his address provoked strong reactions for another reason: up until that moment, Ngũgĩ had been closely associated with the emergence of an African tradition of writing in English and acknowledged as a key figure in the rise of the novel as a major genre on the continent; his fictional work was often cited as an example of how English was being remade in formerly colonised societies. His early novels, from 1964’s Weep Not, Child onward, struck a chord with a global Anglophone audience partly because they echoed the English novelists he had read as a student at Makerere University College, the Ugandan branch of the University of London, and Leeds University, the seat of “Commonwealth” literary studies in the 1960s.By the time of his speech, Ngũgĩ was a member of the literary establishment in Africa, a leading figure in world literature, and a leader in postcolonial thought. And while it is true that he had challenged what he saw as the hegemony of English in a 1968 manifesto, On the Abolition of the English Department, co-written with two of his colleagues at the University of Nairobi, Ngũgĩ assumed that the abolition of English did not mean dispensing with the colonial language. In fact, for most of the 1960s and 1970s he shared a belief, common among the postcolonial elite, that a literature in the ex-coloniser’s language could indeed be revolutionary. But now the novelist had decided to break away from English, to depart, as he put it, “from Anglo-Saxon literature in order to reconnect to the patriotic traditions of a national and culture literature rooted among the people”. He would henceforth write in his mother tongue, Gĩkũyũ (known to Swahili and English speakers as Kikuyu).As I saw the big smile on Ngũgĩ’s face, it dawned on me that writing his novel in Gĩkũyũ had been a kind of homecomingIt is therefore fitting that, in Decolonizing Language, Ngũgĩ, whodied earlier this yearaged 87, should return to the question of language as effectively his final statement. The 20 essays collected in the book rehearse positions first articulated in his earlier collections, Writers in PoliticsandDecolonizing the Mind; but the new book is notable for Ngũgĩ’s attention to the dangers that mother tongues face across the world, from colonial Ireland to Sami Norway, New Zealand and beyond. Read together, the essays resonate as a manifesto for the mother tongue both as “the very heart of our being and existence” and the ultimate firewall against “spiritual domination”. The mission of Decolonizing Language, the “revolutionary idea” encapsulated in the book’s subtitle, is an incisive rejection of the notion that European “languages are inherently global and best able to carry intelligence and universality” or that they function as the languages “of power and normality”.Reading the book and reflecting on the many conversations I had with Ngũgĩ as he tried to come to terms with his exile after learning of threats against his life in 1982, I was reminded of how different the situation was in 1979, when the author made his “epistemological break” with English. I had graduated from the University of Nairobi a few months before, and had taken up a job as a trainee editor in the local office of Heinemann Educational Books, which was at the time a major publisher of African literature. My first task at Heinemann was to edit Devil on the Cross, Ngũgĩ’s first novel in Gĩkũyũ. The famous author had two demands of his young editor: he insisted that his novel be edited to the same standards as the works I was editing in English and that it be directed at common readers, not elites. I went to work on the manuscript, which he had written in prison; when it was all done, and as I sat back and watched the big smile of satisfaction on his face, it dawned on me that for Ngũgĩ writing a novel in Gĩkũyũ had been a kind of homecoming. The book’s initial reception stayed with him for many years: “It was read in groups at homes and factory grounds, on public transportation even, the literate becoming the ‘present’ author of the story,” he noted in 2010.Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: three days with a giant of African literatureRead moreNgũgĩ’s decision to break with English provoked strong reactions: it was hailed by writers and cultural activists working in African languages who had felt left out in postcolonial debates that privileged English; it was criticised by prominent African writers, includingChinua Achebe, the “founding father” of African literature, who insisted that English was a necessary linguistic tool in holding together multiethnic nations. Ngũgĩ refused to concede; instead he embarked on a global crusade defending mother tongues as indispensable tools in the decolonization of the mind. In this context, Decolonizing Language can be read as the author’s final take on the overriding theme of this critical project, a clear diagnosis of the challenges mother tongues face in a world defined by linguistic hierarchies. On a more personal level, the book is Ngũgĩ’s last account of his displacement from his own native ground, an acknowledgement of the heavy burden that those who write and speak the language of the other have to carry. The arguments made in the book are exhilarating; reading them in the author’s absence is undeniably poignant.Simon Gikandi is University Professor of English at Princeton.Decolonizing Language and Other Revolutionary Ideas by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o is published by Allen Lane (£20).

The veteran psychiatrist, author and solitary confinement expert, 81 and still working on multiple projects, is particularly troubled by thebrutalspate of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)raidsrocking communities around the US.“My father came from Russia, so I’m an immigrant’s son,” he said. “I can’t live with these raids. I need to do something about it.”Recently, “doing something” has meant putting the finishing touches on a new book, Ending Isolation: The Case Against Solitary Confinement, which Kupers co-authored with three others.Out on 4 September from Pluto Press, the book is an exhaustively researched takedown ofsolitary confinement: the practice of isolating an incarcerated person for hours, days, weeks or even years in a cell all their own. It’s a practice long decried by experts including Kupers, but despite their repeated warnings, researchers and advocates generally agree that anywhere between 75,000 and 80,000 people are locked in solitary confinement in the US on any given day. The true number could be much higher, and as the book points out, “there is no evidence that solitary confinement actually reduces violence. Instead, there are research findings that point strongly to the opposite conclusion, that solitary confinement worsens the problem of violence, both within prisons and in the public.”View image in fullscreenDr Terry Kupers, left, attends a panel discussion on solitary confinement at UC Berkeley in California in March 2014.Photograph: Michael Macor/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty ImagesConsidering this, Ending Isolation is a vital, systematic dismantling of every possible argument one could use to justify solitary confinement. The book covers everything from the history of solitary, the disturbing overlaps between sexual assault and isolation practices, and a deep dive into who gets “sent to the hole” (spoiler alert: it can be any prisoner at any time for the vaguest reasons that more than often defy logic).The chapters feature narratives from people who have lived through torturous isolation, which makes for a mentally fraying read that feels, at times, like you’re peeking behind a curtain in a room where you’re not meant to be.“Most people who go to solitary confinement are broken by the experience,” Kupers said in an interview with the Guardian. “They have what I’ve termed the decimation of life skills. They become unlearned in terms of how to relate to others, and in terms of the prison environment, they then get into more trouble when they get out of segregation.”Kupers’ insights are based on decades of interviews with people who have experienced solitary confinement in America’s prisons. His latest book offers the in-depth psychiatric research Kupers has previously delivered in five other books and hundreds of articles – only this time he’s joined by three co-authors, including two people who are currently incarcerated.Chris Blackwell, an award-winning journalist currently serving a decades-long sentence in Washington, kicks off the book with an engaging prologue recounting how he endured his first stint in solitary confinement at the age of 12. The experience “solidified my distrust for authority figures forever and drove me into a deep hate for ‘the system’”.View image in fullscreenEnding Isolation: The Case Against Solitary Confinement.Photograph: Pluto PressHe has now spent most of his life as part of that system. By age 18, he’d been arrested more than 20 times. After killing a man during a drug-related robbery (“an act I would never be able to repair”, he writes) Blackwell received the 45-year sentence he is currently serving. More solitary confinement awaited, too.“Nothing is worse than becoming a target in prison,” he writes in the prologue. “I refused to comply with what I felt was a constant abuse of power, and guards refused to allow me to rebel without punishment for my actions.”Even after years in isolation, Blackwell says he is still struggling to understand the impact those experiences had on him. But he knows the good he offers – his writing, his advocacy – is in spite of solitary confinement.Kupers says Blackwell is representative of a large proportion of prisoners: “He didn’t have murder in his mind,” but he committed a terrible crime that will haunt him – and others – for the rest of their lives. When they started working together on this book, Kupers realized that if circumstances were different, he and Blackwell would have been close friends. He admires his intellect, thegrassroots organizationBlackwell helped co-found from behind bars, and the harrowing essays and incarceration accounts Blackwell has published in the Appeal, the New York Times, the Washington Post and many other outlets.“He happens to be behind bars and therefore his life is very limited and restricted,” Kupers said. “But it’s amazing what he’s done given those limits.”It was Blackwell who recruited Kupers to co-author the book alongside himself and Deborah Zalesne, a law professor at the City University of New York. Together, Blackwell and Zalesne had the personal testimonies and legal foundation covered; they needed Kupers to add the mental health angle. He does so convincingly, detailing how solitary confinement, especially when it’s prolonged, can cause severe anxiety, panic, sleep problems, psychotic behavior and severe post-traumatic stress disorder. Many people “sent to the hole” develop a compulsion for self-harm, and Kupers says this shouldn’t surprise anyone.“Prolonged solitary confinement is torture,” he writes.These repeated insights, while necessary, aren’t the main draw of the book. Rather, it’s the contributions of people such as Kwaneta Harris, Ending Isolation’s fourth and final co-author.If we continue to treat people like monsters, that is exactly what they will becomeTerry Kupers, psychiatrist, author and solitary confinement expertHarris is an incarcerated writer whose work has helped shed light on the crisis of sexual assault in prisons.“I used to think there was a timeline for when people lost their minds in solitary confinement. Six months, two years, maybe five. I was wrong. The descent into madness doesn’t follow a schedule. Even now, back in medium-security, I wake up some mornings thinking I’m still in that cell,” she writes.Those passages, coupled with reams of research, leave no doubt that solitary confinement constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The question, then, is if the practice will ever end.“There’s a split in correctional authorities,” Kupers said. “Probably around half think that solitary confinement is a very bad idea.”InDonald Trump’s second term, Kupers is concerned about the advent of places likeAlligator Alcatraz.“This book is representative of this finding that ending solitary confinement is strategically extremely important in the context of what Ice is doing, for instance, and the emergence of a police state,” Kupers said. “If we required that people who are behind bars are entitled to the civil and human rights, which they are by law entitled to, if we gave them those rights, including due process, that would massively change what’s going on right now.”Kupers adds: “If we continue to treat people like monsters, that is exactly what they will become.”Ending Isolation: The Case Against Solitary Confinementcomes out on 4 September from Pluto Press. The book’s release date coincides with the launch of a nationwide bus tour hosted byUnlock the Box.Explore more on these topicsBooksUS prisonsSolitary confinementreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s from her pamphletNotes from the North, published by Smith/Doorstop in 2022, and was a 2019 winner of its annual International Book and Pamphlet competition. Focused on the violent disruptions experienced by the poet’s family members during the Korean war and subsequent North Korean dictatorship, the collection was described byAmy Wack, one of the competition judges, as“a scorched family album, rescued from the ruin”.Search Engine is an invocation to the poet’s grandfather, circling round a series of three apostrophes that suggest the intensifying fact of his absence: “Grandfather I cannot find”, “Grandfather I’ll never know” and “Grandfather, stranger”. That the voice in its fruitless search reverberates over much of human history, 20th century history in particular, is signalled by the epigraph. In the East German poet Durs Grünbein’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Border Dog, the dog remembers the now-invisible border and the “strip of land” he once guarded: “Watchtowers are forgetful, / Like eyes which have been torn from their sockets. / Gone already: the separating place’s / Two or three names. // The trick’s now unbetrayed / which made a strip of land a hole in time. / I’m glad my brow does not reveal a thing.”Kim’s triplet stanza gives a sense of the circularity of the search-within-a-search enforced by the “hole in time”. For her, the hole is a wormhole. In her quest for the specificity she needs to flesh out the truth of her past, the searcher asks her grandfather: “what country do you belong to: // where is your body buried, / where did your soul go / when the road led nowhere?” Why these questions are urgent is explained in the preceding poem, Searchlight. The grandfather leaves his 10-year-old son (the poet’s future father) in a forest in North Korea’s far north, “whisperingWait in the woods until I come back.”But the boy’s father doesn’t return, ever. The poem evolves into a series of agonised questions as to why the abandoned son hasn’t tried to find him. The searchlight’s brightest illumination is saved for the questioner’s final sharp pang of insight: “Is it better not to know what happened, as if the not-knowing could keep him alive?”While the “searchlight” has become a “search engine” in the current poem, the wormhole of infinite connections flows on: it “has no end”, as time, for the child, waiting in the woods for his father to return, would have seemed to have no end. There is still a border between now and the past, and “on the other side // lies a memory of a memory / or a dream of a dream of a dream / of another life …” The puzzle of alternative possibilities is interrupted in the ninth stanza by the device of making the challenged reality so harshly present it shoulders all alternative dreaming aside: “no bloodshot eyes, or broken / bottles, or praying with cracked lips / because the past is past andwasis notis–”But again, there’s a feeling of circularity in the shifts of consciousness suggested, between drunkenness and thirst, or sleeplessness and prayer.Scrupulously precise, despite her passion, the speaker utters her last plea (“Grandfather, stranger, / give me back my father –”) and instantly checks herself, “or not back, not back, give me the father // I might have had …” In the search engine of the poem, complexity of thought always coexists with openly expressed emotion. The title metaphor implies that the desire for answers could, should, be matched by the availability and interconnectivity of facts; if it’s not, the drive to go on seeking answers in the absence of connection can be relentless. Physics can’t help the recovery of the lost “flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone …” Time can’t be reversed, and the search is abandoned unfinished, “there, in the country that no longer exists, / on the other side of the war –”Kim writes, “There are an estimated 10 million separated families (이산가족) divided between North and South Korea, including my own.” For additional context, her short essay,no end / to the end, is essential reading.Explore more on these topicsPoetryCarol Rumens's poem of the weekNorth KoreaSouth KoreaAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It has a funny circularity that chimes with the self-aware nature of the show. Looking us in the eye, Belgian actors Verona Verbakel and Anemone Valcke tell us they are committed to being truthful. It is a promise that puts us on alert: do we really believe everything they say? How much is artifice? How much constructed?They confess to misleading us in one respect. The show is only superficially about egotism. There is a nice joke when Verbakel describes The Ego as her show, then remembers Valcke and attributes it to both of them. They flatter each other and glow with the praise. In their anecdotes from film sets and award ceremonies, they present themselves as actors who are hungry for the spotlight, insecure about rejection and in need of affirmation. Their ego drives their ambition and punishes their failures.Scott Turnbull presents … Surreally Good review – that’s edutainment!Read moreBut is their ego really what makes them feel so vulnerable? Or could it more accurately be their need to please in a ruthlessly competitive industry? Could their frustrations stem from having to suppress their rage at a post-#MeToo culture in which anti-female bias and microaggressions persist? Should a woman expect to be a male director’s muse; should she tolerate a male actor’s onstage kisses; should she welcome a new age of equality when a gender-blind acting award goes only to men?Like several shows at this year’s Edinburgh fringe, The Ego is not about the most obvious abuses of male power and perhaps not even about behaviour that would meet the legal threshold of discrimination. Rather, it reflects a world in which women in their early 30s (they both appeared inSirens by Ontroerend Goedmore than 10 years ago) still find themselves constrained, moulded and defined by men. Their experiences dent their ego but their ego is not to blame.AtZoo Playground, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatreActingComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

It is also a weapon. In this captivating piece of storytelling theatre, Emily Woof makes a connection between the two. On the one hand, there isRevolver, the seminal 1966 album by the Beatles; on the other, there is the gun wielded byValerie Solanaswhen she attempted to kill Andy Warhol in 1968.The play is a perfect, if coincidental, companion piece toPhilosophy of the Worldby In Bed With My Brother, playing elsewhere on the Edinburgh fringe. Where that show combines the story of the 60s girl group the Shaggs with the rage of Solanas’s Scum (Society for Cutting Up Men) manifesto, Woof’s play filters the female adulation of the Beatles through the same feminist lens.In Hamish McColl’s spare, fluid production, the writer and performer plays Jane Fraser, an ex-teacher who has landed a job as a TV researcher. Alighting on her mother’s teenage obsession with John Lennon, she proposes a documentary about the power of female desire. She is delighted when her male producer likes the idea, less so when he wants to call it Fan Girls: Young, Dumb and Fun.View image in fullscreenThe rage of Solanas … Emily Woof in Revolver.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/the GuardianHer acquiescence is one of a number of compromises – accepting her husband’s infidelity, sleeping with her new boss, losing the rights to her own idea – that fuel an anger comparable to that of Solanas after Warhol lost the only copy of her play Up Your Ass.Woof’s play explodes from a mismatch. On one hand, there is the cultural revolution heralded by the Beatles and primarily benefiting men; on the other, there is the promise of sexual and social liberation offered to young women, but frustrated by conservative values and sexist bias. With her conversational manner and scatty air of insecurity, Woof’s character becomes a conduit for a fury she has yet to put a name to.AtPleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalThe BeatlesAndy WarholFeminismreviewsShareReuse this content"

What could a good review do for her? Briefly boost her ego, yes; shift a few seats, perhaps; make some more noise amid the festival cacophony, for sure. But would it have any value beyond that? She cannot live on acclaim.Maxwell speaks from experience. Hers was the show that went from flop to phenomenon in 2023 afterPhoebe Waller-Bridgesaw it as part of an audience of two. But the subsequent fringe success for Nan, Me and Barbara Pravi did not translate to bumper sales year round. Nor did Maxwell particularly want it to.Cancelling shows leads to existential despair and she does not want that, but what the performer likes best is to connect with small groups in intimate spaces. Should it not be possible, she wonders, to do her job without going to either extreme of hype or obscurity?But if she were to devise a formula for success, what would it look like? Hence, Babyfleareindeerbag – its name a reference to Waller-Bridge’s breakout hit Fleabag and Richard Gadd’sfringe-to-Netflix drama Baby Reindeer.

Maybe a poetic drama about falling in love with a singer who wrote a song reflecting on their relationship?

In this funny, delightfully meta show, we get to sample all three and to share our opinions.Ironically, the best marketing tool turns out to be a catchy title.

It’s not what you’d have expected from this serious, intense, spiritually driven composer, who died earlier this year – or, to be honest, from any other composer.It opens in atmospheric, modern-classical style, ominous bells against high, tense strings. Then it explodes into funky bass guitar and brass, driving drum kit and the Star Trek-like ahhing of a close-miked vocal trio – here it was Synergy Vocals – and it’s as if the stage has been taken over by Magnum PI. Gubaidulina pits these two musics against each other, with the jazz-funk periodically dissolving into snatches of Mahlerian melody and translucent orchestral stillness – at one point a few lines of poetry are spoken on top, amid an aura of whispers from the orchestral players. Finally, there’s a slow splurge of Bond theme-ish excess – brilliantly bonkers, and the Albert Hall loved it.A quick recalibration of the ears was required for Ravel’s G major Piano Concerto,Benjamin Grosvenorthe quicksilver soloist. His playing brought out the bluesiness of Ravel’s music, especially in the slow movement, where the tender, meandering melody sounded a split-second out from the accompaniment, as if it were being delivered by a singer perched on a stool in a jazz club. Every note was clear, even as the conductorRyan Bancroftromped through ever-faster tempos in the finale – and that also went for Grosvenor’s encore, the finale of Prokofiev’s Sonata No 7, three glorious minutes of ferocious edge-of-the-seat brilliance.The second half was less crowd-pleasing, if still powerful. Shostakovich’s 1962 Symphony No 13 employs a bass-baritone soloist and men’s choir to give voice first to a harrowing response to the Holocaust massacre at Babi Yar near Kyiv and then to four other darkly subversive poems about Russia. Bancroft had the orchestra playing with pointed character, and the men of the BBC National Chorus of Wales delivered line after Russian line excellently, but for all his velvety, cavernous bass tone the Lithuanian soloistKostas Smoriginasneeded more swagger in this huge space. Perhaps the work itself travels less well than Shostakovich’s other symphonies; certainly, it was a heavy counterweight to a kaleidoscopic first half.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

A year later he was immortalised in theOscar-winning film The Imitation Gameandin 2021 he became the face of the £50 note.A cornerstone of that legacy is in trouble, however. This month a group of stafffiled a whistleblower complaint with the Charity Commission, which has a regulatory role over ATI because the nominally independent organisation is a registered charity – albeit largely funded by the UK government.The complaint raised eight points of concern including the possibility that £100m of government funding might be withdrawn, which “could lead to the Institute’s collapse”.View image in fullscreenBank of England £50 banknote celebrating Alan Turing.Photograph: Bank Of England/Reuters“These concerns are so significant that many staff now believe the institute’s charitable status and public credibility are at risk,” said the complaint, which also raised concerns about internal governance and culture as well as oversight of spending.It is the latest in a series of staff broadsides at management. In March last year more than 180 staffwrote a letter to leadershipexpressing “serious concerns” about the organisation’s approach to diversity after it appointed four men to senior roles. In Decembermore than 90 staff warned in another letterthat ATI’s credibility was in “serious jeopardy” amid a restructuring that was threatening jobs – and research projects.ATI has recently notified about 50 staff – or approximately 10% of its workforce – that they are at risk of redundancy and is shutting down projects related to online safety, tackling the housing crisis and reducing health inequality.This is part of an overhaul dubbed Turing 2.0 under which the institute will focus on three key areas: health, the environment, and defence and security.A recent letter from the UK technology secretary,Peter Kyle, has made clear the overhaul does not go far enough. Writing to ATI’s chair last month, Kyle demanded the institute switch its main focus to defence and security, adding that ATI’s “longer-term funding arrangement” could be reviewed next year.“Moving forward, defence and national security projects should form a core of ATI’s activities, and relationships with the UK’s security, defence, and intelligence communities should be strengthened accordingly,” Kyle wrote.He also indicated that leadership changes might be needed.View image in fullscreenPeter Kyle, the technology secretary, has demanded the institute switch its main focus to defence and security.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“To realise this vision, it is imperative that the ATI’s leadership reflects the institute’s reformed focus,” he wrote. “Careful consideration should be given to the importance of an executive team who possesses a relevant background and sector knowledge to lead this transition.”It is against this backdrop – long-running staff dissatisfaction with leadership, a strategic and financial overhaul, and then a bombshell from the government – that the whistleblower complaint was filed.ATI is led by chief executive Jean Innes, who has had senior roles in the civil service and tech sector, and is chaired by Doug Gurr, the former head of Amazon’s UK operations andinterim chair of the UK’s competition watchdog.Gurr responded to Kyle last month with a letter pledging to “step up” on defence and national security as well as boosting the UK’s self-sufficiency in AI – or “sovereign capabilities”.“We will step up at a time of national need,” Gurr wrote.However, Gurr added that ATI will “continue to drive forward high-impact work in environment and healthcare” where it fits with the “government’s missions and the interests of our philanthropic and private funders”.At a recent meeting between staff and ATI leadership, held remotely, Gurr faced pointed questions about the new direction raised by Kyle and the institute’s restructuring. One attender said the atmosphere was difficult, describing the mood among the more than 100 employees during the meeting as “contemptuous throughout”.In an internal note to staff this week, Innes and Gurr confirmed a new working group of government officials and ATI staff had met to discuss the new direction. It also confirmed people would be leaving through redundancies and non-renewal of contracts.ATI’s goals include to “advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well as driving an “informed public conversation” on AI. Its five founding UK universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, UCL and Warwick, with its research work including teaming up with the Met Office toimprove weather forecasting, creatingcardiac “digital twins”to study heart disease andimproving air traffic control.View image in fullscreenDoug Gurr, chair of ATI, was said to have faced pointed questions about the institute’s new direction from staff in a ‘contemptuous’ mood.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianA source who worked in the previous Conservative government said Labour’s concerns about the institute are “far from new” and there had been disquiet in political circles about the institute’s performance for some time, with multiple university stakeholders blurring its focus.In that context, the source said, it makes sense to double down on what the institute does well – defence and security – or “just shut it down and start again”.Prof Jon Crowcroft, the Marconi professor of communication systems at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Lab, and an adviser to Innes, says the institute’s staff have become unsettled.“I think the crisis in terms of people is real. A lot of people are still there because they believe it’s a good, open institution doing valuable public work. But they’re also wondering where their job is going to be,” he says.He adds: “I have not seen a plan A for keeping all the staff happy, which would mean keeping some non-defence and security projects. The reason why staff have issued these letters is because they have not seen that.”Referring to ATI’s base at the British Library in London, he says: “Nor have I seen a plan B for what happens if too many people leave, because so many projects have gone, which means the core funding is not viable and they cannot justify the size of the building they are in.”There are “mixed views” on the looming shift to defence and security, according to a current staff member who says they have listened to a “diverse” array of concerns among colleagues.“We understand the national importance issue. Very few of us are saying that work shouldn’t happen. But we think a singular focus would be too narrow. Turing’s strength comes from applying AI to a wide range of societal challenges, from health to the environment, with responsible innovation at the heart.”View image in fullscreenThe British Library where ATI is based.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThe staff member adds: “Those areas are still important, and with the right leadership we could fulfil the vision and purpose that brought us here in the first place.”The staff member adds that Gurr’s letter pledging to double down on defence and security, while still working on health and environment, leaves ATI in a “precarious standoff” with government.“The leadership is hoping the government’s attention, or its personnel, shifts,” they said. Hall says the institute has no choice but to change.“Clearly there is not much money around and the institute needs to do what the government asks. If it doesn’t, then presumably the government will close it down.”She adds: “The institute has ceased to be what it was initially set up to be, which was a national institute for data science and AI. The government has asked it to focus on defence and security. Whether the UK needs such an institute is for the government to decide. Personally I would like to see the justification.”Crowcroft, who defends the quality of the institute’s work, says the UK has always been strong in AI and is “probably now stronger still”, pointing to multiple generations of AI expertise produced by universities such as Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College and Edinburgh as well as the success of London-based Google DeepMind and the establishment of UK-based AI units by leading US tech firms such as Microsoft and OpenAI.A spokesperson for ATI said the institute was going through “substantial” change to continue to deliver in its unique role as the UK’s national institute for data science and AI.“As we move forward, we’re focused on delivering real-world impact across society’s biggest challenges, including responding to the national need to double down on our work in defence, national security and sovereign capabilities.”A government spokesperson said the technology secretary wants ATI to show value for money for taxpayer, which can be achieved by “giving the institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be”.Turing’s legacy will live on. But in terms of the institute that bears his name, its longevity is in doubt.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Alan TuringComputingPeter KylenewsShareReuse this content"

But can the Wedding Present’s acerbic songs work on stage? We meet the team making it happen – and the ‘rock god’ who penned the hitsDave SimpsonMon 18 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTShareIn 2009, Matt Aston was watching the Wedding Present frontman David Gedge perform a “bizarre and brilliant” gig with the BBC Big Band when he was struck by a notion: that the combination of the singer’s conversational lyrics and brassy, orchestrated new arrangements felt a bit like, well, watching a musical.“I parked the idea,” says Aston, a theatre director and writer. “Then some time later, I saw David’s other band Cinerama with a 16-piece orchestra and thought, ‘This could be musical theatre!’” Aston had had a few drinks and remembers sitting afterwards, trying to convince his mate – screenwriter and playwright William Ivory, who hadn’t been drinking – that this wasn’t the daftest idea ever. “Billy said, ‘You can’t make a musical out of Wedding Present lyrics. It’s not that kind of music.’” Aston laughs, aware that pop musicals tend to be vehicles for colourful, uber-mainstream acts such as Queen or Abba, not veteran indie rock bands. “But I said, ‘Oh yes you can.’”Keir Starmer came to a lot of our gigs. But I’m still waiting for my invitation to Downing StreetAnd oh yes he has.Reception: A New Musicalis about to premiere in the band’s home town of Leeds. Various Covid-related delays mean its appearance now serendipitously coincides with the band’s 40th anniversary and new retrospective collection, 40. Aston, more usually associated with theatrical productions such asIvory’s RAF play Bomber’s Moon, insists he would never have done it without Gedge, the show’s creative consultant. However, the singer says that when Aston first approached him in 2020, he was “astounded”.Gedge, speaking by video call from his Brighton home, says: “I told him, ‘I don’t know anything about musicals – and I’m not even sure I like them!’ But he explained that my lyrics are like dialogue, which he could link together in a storyline. Then the pandemic happened and I was half expecting to never hear from him again. A year ago, he called and said, ‘I’ve written it. I’m starting auditioning and then rehearsals. Can you come along?’”View image in fullscreenUps, downs and breakups … rehearsals for Reception: A New Musical.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Northedge PhotographyReception isn’t a biographical musical. It’s an emotionally charged story about friends who meet at the University of Leeds and subsequently go through ups, downs and breakups. When I sit in on rehearsals, I instantly pick up on Gedge’s impassioned lyrics. Lines such as “I just decided I don’t trust you any more”, from the 1990 hit Brassneck, are delivered by characters in emotionally appropriate situations, experiencing love, betrayal, loss, you name it. Meanwhile, actor-musicians nail that head-rushing Wedding Present sound, something the singer sums up as “the Velvet Underground – but faster”.The Wedding Present have been York-based Aston’s favourite band ever since he saw them at Confettis nightclub in Derby on 20 October 1988. They were one of the foremost British indie rock bands of the late 80s and 90s, successors to the Smiths. “I was 15 and really small,” he grins during a lunchbreak. “Everyone had to huddle around me to sneak me in. But the noise, the lights, the surge forward, beer going everywhere, balloons coming down from the ceiling … I got a nosebleed within minutes, but I was blown away.” Since that day, he has seen the Wedding Present and Cinerama “60 or 70” times.Like the characters in Reception, the band came together in and around Leeds uni. Born in the town’s Bramley area, maths student Gedge was the first of his extended working-class family to go into higher education. “So,” he says, “when I packed it in and said, ‘I’m gonna be famous’, they were appalled. I stopped going home because we’d have arguments all the time. But they had instilled a work ethic. I was very driven.”Gedge describes how the band sat individually cutting and glueing the sleeves for 500 copies of their first single, Go Out and Get ’Em Boy!, released on their Reception label for £500. When John Peel played it on Radio 1, the singer was so excited he ran all the way to bassist Keith Gregory’s house to shout: “Have you got the radio on?” As Gedge recalls: “Peel played it 10 times. At that point, my life changed.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve seen them 60 or 70 times’ ... writer, director and fan Matt Aston at rehearsals.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Northedge PhotographyAlthough 1987 debut album George Best and 1989’s Bizarro exemplify the band’s inimitable, classic sound, Gedge insists the musical fits in with “the Wedding Present tradition of going off at weird tangents”. Indeed. George Best was an indie No 1, making them such hot property that they signed to major label RCA for “the sort of deal normally given to people like Annie Lennox”. And then their next release for their new label was an album of Ukrainian folk songs, instigated by guitarist Peter Solowka (who later formed the Ukrainians).In 1991, as the music world went baggy, the “Weddoes” listened to US alt-rock and made the slower, darker album Seamonsters with “a maverick engineer no one had heard of”. This was Steve Albini, who subsequently produced Nirvana. “We literally lost half our fans,” Gedge admits. “But now they all think it’s one of our best albums.”In 1992, they released a single every month. “That was such a great idea that we had it all planned within 15 minutes,” the singer laughs. “All seven-inch singles, cover versions on the B-side, matching sleeves. To RCA’s credit, they said OK.” All of which paid off when the band equalled Elvis Presley’s record of 12 UK Top 40 hits in one year.I’ve just written songs – I’m not a doctor who saved livesDavid GedgeThere have also been some lyrical curveballs: 1987’s All About Eve reflected on the year Gedge spent in apartheid South Africa as a child, while 1989’s Kennedy dwelt on conspiracy theories. But Gedge insists that the overwhelming majority of his 300-plus songs are about relationships, meaning they’re well-suited for drama.His early lyrics are particularly raw. The 2018 documentary Something Left Behind suggested they were all triggered by being dumped by his first love, but Gedge says otherwise. “Jaz was my first proper girlfriend. She chucked me and went off with someone else, but after her there was Alexandra, then Sally.” He says a lot of the lyrics – such as those to My Favourite Dress (“a drunken kiss, a stranger’s hand on my favourite dress”) – were drawn from real life. “But that wasn’t Jaz, that was Alexandra.”For Aston, such songs capture “those moments we all have where someone is the centre of your world, then your world ends and that kind of defines you”. To this day, Wedding Present gigs are full of men (and some women) of a certain age, singing Gedge’s words, occasionally tearfully. “A psychologist once explained that men of my generation didn’t talk about emotions,” says the singer, “so they come up and thank me for getting them through their divorce or whatever with the songs. It’s flattering – but I just write songs. I’m not a doctor who saved their life.”View image in fullscreen‘It features me without me. It’s clever, really’ … Gedge, right, with the band in the 1990s.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesOne fan is Keir Starmer. In 2023, the PM – who studied law in Leeds – revealed that My Favourite Dress, which is beautifully reimagined in Reception as a piano ballad, is one of his favourite songs. “David,” Starmer explained, “managed to perfectly distil the tortuous agonising feelings of jealousy into three minutes of angst.”“He came to a lot of our early gigs,” Gedge reveals. “I don’t remember him because there were loads of lads and girls, but he was a mate of a mate of Keith’s and I’m told I have hung out with him.” The singer smiles broadly. “But I’m still waiting for my invitation to Downing Street, like Noel Gallagher got from Tony Blair.”Now 65, Gedge carries his “indie rock god” status lightly. When Aston first met him properly, after years of “mumbled hellos at the merchandise stall”, he found someone he could work with – and whose presence looms over Reception. “There are many not-so-subtle references in the script,” the writer-director laughs. “All the character names are from the songs. The lead character spends a year in Seattle, which David did, although we moved the couple in My Favourite Dress from Manchester to Brighton. So there’s a bit of me in there and a lot of him.”For Gedge, Reception is “a fictional story but it kind of features me without me. Which is clever, really.” Aston knows the project is quite a departure but says: “I wouldn’t take the risk for myself or David if I thought it wouldn’t work. It’s a love letter to the band – a thank you for the last 40 years.”Reception: A New Musicalis at The Warehouse in Holbeck (Slung Low), Leeds, from 22 August to 6 September.

It stuck in my head as the ultimate horror film – it terrified the daylights out of me. Terence’s greatest beauties were his eyes – in some of the early films you don’t see it, but in person, when they were shining, he could hold a room. He’d sit there and say, “Watch this, I’m going to stop a restaurant.” And he could do it. I saw him do it! It was extraordinary. He once told me that he used to have real fun on Superman when he was bored, stuck on top of the ice castle. “I’d just stare down until everyone went quiet,” he said.We tried many actors when casting Bernadette inThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but absolutely everybody turned the role down. Terence was easily on the top of our list, but we thought he’d never do it. The honest truth is, he turned it down at first. But out of nowhere, his agent said to him, “Well, you’re bored. You’ve just done superhero movies. Why don’t you do something else?” It was astonishing when his agent reached out and said, “No, he wants to talk.” We were falling over ourselves. If he wanted the role, it was his.Terence Stamp: the mesmerisingly seductive dark prince of British cinemaRead moreWe talked long and hard about why he’d initially said no. It was fear. And fair enough – you have got to remember we were coming out of the HIV/Aids mess. It was a taboo subject. I looked at the work that he’d done all the way through, like the Italian years when he worked with Fellini and Pasolini, and thought: this was a man who took chances. And I think he was at absolutely the right moment in his life where he was ready for another chance.View image in fullscreenGuy Pearce, Terence Stamp and Hugo Weaving in 1994’s The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyTerence admitted he was absolutely terrified to play Bernadette – he was being voted one of the best-looking men on earth and suddenly in Priscilla he was, and this is a direct quote, “dressed up as an old dog”. But he put the pain of what he was going through into the performance, and that’s what made the film.In my head, I had a very clear idea of who Bernadette was. I remember looking at Terence when he came out presented as Bernadette for the first time. I said, “Well this isn’t what I pictured in my head, but it’s interesting. Let’s talk about it.” Meanwhile, Terence looked at the mirror and completely exploded. From that point in the film, no mirrors were allowed. It was the fear. But he worked it in – he knew what he was doing. Every day, they’d say, “You want to see rushes?” And he’d say, “No. If I’m committing, I’m going for it.”View image in fullscreenTerence Stamp and Julie Christie in Far From the Madding Crowd.Photograph: Vic/Appia/Rex/ShutterstockBy the time we finished the shoot, he was way past being afraid and Priscilla was a real high point for him. Over the years, we became very close. He was a loner, but we became really good pals. Anytime I was anywhere near him, I would visit. Once you got through the layers, he was an East End boy, a working-class boy, and I think over the years, the thing I most loved was that he let me into that world. And sometimes it was very foul-mouthed!Terence would complain that he was only ever asked about two things: Priscilla or Superman. The amount of times he said to me, “Far From the Madding Crowd [1967] – I’ve never worked so hard at something so magnificent and it has been forgotten.” I said, “It’s called time, Terence.” He said, “But Priscilla is 30 years old. Why doesn’t it go away? They only ask me about two films, and one of them’s fucking Priscilla.” And I’d get the giggles. That’s when we began talking about a Priscilla sequel. On that front, let’s just say – he agreed to do the sequel a few years ago and we’ve been particularly busy over the past year.By the end of his career, he was working to keep himself entertained. He was discerning – if he’d already seen something like it, he didn’t care. If something pressed his buttons and piqued his interest, he’d consider it. His Italian years were just breathtaking. Who the hell gets to work with all those people? He said to me, “I just drifted from one to the other – if somebody had something interesting, I’d do it. That’s the way it’s always been.”Terence kept to himself. He was an enigma. And then he’d show up, use the eyes and turn everybody to jelly. He was a wonderful man – and he’s not done yet.Stephan Elliott is a film-maker and director of The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Explore more on these topicsTerence StampAustralian filmThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the DesertfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s $1,300 on trash’: the adults addicted to blind box toys like LabubusGrownups get thrills from opening these collectibles they buy without knowing what they’re getting – but experts warn the craze is akin to gamblingAmelia TaitMon 18 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 11.59 EDTShareJess has never touched a slot machine, played the lottery or bought a scratch-off, but she fears she may have a gambling problem nonetheless.This July, the 28-year-old found herself spending up to $270 a week on blind boxes – that is, surprise items that are sold in sealed, opaque packaging. Activewear companies, bookshops and even candy stores all sell mystery bundles of their products, but the brands currently dominating the market produce collectible toys with cute but unusual names. If you want a complete collection of Labubu, Smiski, Dimoo, Pucky, Skullpanda or Sonny Angel figurines, then you will have to buy blind box after blind box, sighing at every duplicate and praying the next package contains the creature you need to finish the set.“It’s silly but it is very addictive,” says Jess, who is based in Ireland but prefers not to reveal her full name or occupation. Jess started buying Labubu dolls in April after seeing them on TikTok: these strange, toothsome and fuzzy monsters have exploded in popularity this year thanks to celebrity endorsements and social media hype. Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind Labubus and many other mystery collectibles, is now estimated to be worth $40bn – but in June, the company’s stock briefly plunged after a Chinesestate media publicationcondemned blind box marketing as predatory.The buyer’s guilt that I get nearly every time after I’ve spent is insane … Sometimes I open things and I don’t want themJessJess believes she is addicted to blind boxes: after she tried banning herself from buying them in July, she “snapped” and suddenly found herself ordering 25 more. Sitting at home and waiting for parcels to arrive, she would itch to go out and physically get some more: “I would end up buying stuff that I didn’t care about just for the thrill of opening a box.” Jess found herself purchasing mystery plushies from the brand Squishmallows, which she doesn’t even like. “I’d open them and be like, ‘Why do I now have this squishy lobster?’”Jess says opening blind boxes feels like gambling because of the highs and lows: “Whenever you get the one that you want, it’s unreal.”On social media, it’s easy to see the impulse buying provoked by blind box marketing. In oneTikTok videowith 2.6m likes, a woman buys a $27.99 Skullpanda, looks at the list of possible toys inside the box and says she would “be happy with any of them” except the Christmas tree dolls. Low and behold, the box contains the Christmas tree, and – visibly frustrated – she rushes back to the store to buy a second box. Another $27.99 later, she becomes the less-than-proud owner of two Christmas trees.In adifferent video, a man buys six bags of mystery Disney pins at $44.99 each, but after ending up with 17 duplicates and an incomplete set, goes back to buy two more, bringing his total spend to almost $360.And some buyers don’t just seek the toys they personally like – they also hunt for the “rare” or “secret” items that are more uncommon and thus more valuable.View image in fullscreenLabubu figurines sit on a shelf at the Labu’Tique Shop in Anaheim, California, in June.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty Images“The buyer’s guilt that I get nearly every time after I’ve spent is insane,” Jess says, adding that she could have used the money for her forthcoming wedding. “If it were to continue like this, it would become dire, because who can pop off £1,000 [$1,300] in a couple of months on literal shit?” Jess says she feels “debilitated” by her habit. “Sometimes I open things and I don’t want them.”Dana Nguyen is a 27-year-old from Monterey, California, who has spent $4,000 on Labubu dolls since the start of this year (on the Pop Mart website, Labubu dolls and figurines range in price from $19.99 to $959.50 each). This April, Nguyen realised she had a problem when she went to her PO Box and saw 20 parcels waiting for her. “I’m telling myself I want to fly to Europe, I want to travel the world, but how can I do that if I’m spending $4,000 on fur, cotton, vinyl, whatever these things are made of?”When asked to describe the feeling she gets when opening blind boxes, she says: “Honestly, that’s gambling. I’m gonna say it flat out: it’s straight gambling.“I always tell myself I won’t be one of those people in Vegas gambling on the slot machines or on the tables – and then I’m over here doing the exact same thing.”Adults in America are buying more toys than ever before. In the first half of 2025, the number of toys bought for grownupsincreased 18%– and in 2024, adults bought more toys for themselvesthan for preschoolersfor the very first time. Enthusiasts offer easy explanations for their “kidulting”, summarised neatly in oneBBC headline: “Adults buying kids’ toys to escape global turmoil.” As Nguyen puts it: “You’re already struggling as it is, with the economy, with society, and you think: OK, let me just have a little sweet treat because I’m not able to afford other luxuries in life.”Meanwhile, collecting is a very compelling habit. Cary Lee is an Australia-based marketing specialist who researches consumer behaviour. Leehas foundsix main reasons that people collect, including a sense of achievement, an extension of selfhood, community membership and a desire for a legacy. Lee’s studies have shown that the financial motivation to build a collection (for instance, the idea it might be worth something one day) is relatively weak compared with these intrinsic, emotional incentives. “We have an innate part of us which wants to acquire items to make a collection,” he says.Toy companies, of course, are well aware of this. In a 2020prospectus for potential investors, Pop Mart wrote: “While traditional toys are primarily for children to play with, pop toys target young adults between 15 years old and 40 years old in general, who seek for emotional value from expressing personality and attitude.” The company declared itself “relentless” in its desire to “attract and build a fast-growing, young and passionate fanbase” and argued that blind boxes in particular inspire repeat purchases “due to unpredictability and fun”.It’s a perfect selling point for people like me who are struggling with their mental health, to just have that little sweet treatDana NguyenIn 2019, Pop Mart asked market research company Frost & Sullivan to survey more than 1,000 consumers and found that, “around 70% of pop toy consumers would purchase blind box toys three times or more for a specific toy design they want”.Lee hasconductedstudieson blind boxes and has found that most US consumers often come across their first blind box in stores and buy them impulsively. Yet regardless of the outcome – whether they get the toy they like the look of or a dud – people are often compelled to go back and buy another box. One of Lee’s papers uncovered “an addictive loop of impulsive purchases”, arguing there was “a ‘dark side’ to a seemingly innocuous product”.Online, an oft-repeated defence for the hyperconsumption of collectible toys is: “It makes me happy. It’s not harming anyone” – but is that really true? Beyond the environmental impact – not only are the toys themselves plastic, the packaging is often elaborate and multilayered to add to the thrill of unboxing – there is also personal wellbeing to consider. Nguyen says she initially hid the scale of her spending from her husband (whose business she helps run), and her mental health suffered at the peak of her blind box addiction.“I have bipolar and I have very manic episodes where I’m willing to take more risks than I normally would,” she says. After high-energy episodes, sometimes she finds herself irritable and in a low mood. “You just want a little quick fix. It’s a perfect selling point for people like me who are struggling with their mental health, to just have that little sweet treat, to have that little bit of serotonin or dopamine in their systems.”View image in fullscreenShoppers choose from 10 tons of mystery packs during a blind sale at Merlata Bloom shopping mall in February in Milan, Italy.Photograph: Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty ImagesNow that she has restricted herself to purchasing fewer blind boxes, Nguyen says: “I feel like my nervous system has calmed a lot more.”Eddie is a 34-year-old cashier from Mississippi who recently spent about $400 on blind boxes in a single month. “It made me feel sick to my stomach because I didn’t feel like I was in control of what I was spending,” he says. “I’d immediately have buyer’s remorse after making a purchase, and sometimes, I wasn’t even excited to get the package. I was more worried about the damage I’d done to my savings and finances.”A burgeoning field of study into these gambling-like mechanisms and their impact has researchers concerned. Leon Xiao is an assistant professor at the City University of Hong Kong who researches video game law and the challenges of regulating gambling-like products. Xiao’s work has historically focused on “loot boxes”, which are digital blind boxes sold for real money inside video games. (The items inside often help players perform better in the game.) Yet Xiao is intrigued by the increased “gamblification” of physical merchandise. “I’ve seen T-shirts being sold in blind boxes, chocolates in blind boxes,” he says.While Xiao pours cold water on one Chinese studypublished in 2022, which found that engaging with blind boxes was positively associated with suicide risk in young people – “that’s obviously going too far. There’s also a paper about drinking milk tea or boba linked to suicidal ideation” – he is troubled by other research findings. Onelongitudinal studypublished in 2023 found that young people who bought loot boxes participated in more gambling six months later than those who did not. One ofXiao’s own studieshas found a correlation between buying mystery card packs and experiencing gambling problems. And apaper published this Julyargued that loot box spending can be associated with psychological distress and an increased risk of “extreme distress”. Xiao says: “We are concerned about vulnerable people spending more money and experiencing harm.”Xiao wonders whether new consumer laws might be the answer. In China, a set ofadvisory guidelinesreleased in 2022 asked companies to publish probability disclosures, set age and spending limits, and even implement “pity mechanics” whereby customers are offered the item they desire after making a number of purchases. These guidelines also banned the sale of blind boxes to kids under age eight and required older children obtain parental permission before buying them – but in practice, enforcement is not so stringent.It became like a game … Most of the time I didn’t want the stuff, I just liked the excitement of waiting, finding and obtaining themBethanIn the US, the Federal Trade Commission haslooked intovideo game loot boxes and evenfined one developer$20m for unfairly marketing to children and misleading players about the odds, but the FTC declined to comment on blind boxes when contacted by the Guardian. In 2018, loot boxes weredeclared illegalunder existing gambling laws in Belgium, butXiao’s researchhas found that enforcement remains a problem there, too.Jesper Andersson is a 23-year-old from Sweden who realised in 2024 that he had spent more than $4,000 in just a few months on mystery packs in the video game Fifa. “I’ve gambled normally on football and stuff like that, but I get anxious if I even lose $10. But when I drop $100 on Fifa, I don’t even care,” he says. “It’s hard to explain why, it just feels very different.” Perhaps it feels different because Andersson’s Fifa pack habit started as a child – without his own disposable income, he asked for Fifa coins every Christmas for nine years.A number of children’s toys are now sold via a mystery mechanism: LOL Surprise! dolls, Mini Brands, and endless Disney figurines and plushies. It’s easy to see how youngsters are becoming acclimatised to this type of consumption, which could arguably normalise gambling.In June, Bethan found herself with no money left for gas thanks to her Labubu habit. The 55-year-old – who has just passed the California bar exam and asked to use a pseudonym – got hooked on the dolls in May. “It became like a game. Some of the time – most of the time – I didn’t want the stuff. I just liked the excitement of waiting, finding and obtaining them,” she says.Bethan has spent hundreds of dollars on Labubus (and knockoff “Lafufus”) in just a few months; while she has been able to pay her bills, she has had to borrow money for gas, has no money left for emergencies, and has increased her credit card debt. “There are things I didn’t normally have to save up for but now I have to,” she says.But Bethan is not just motivated by the blind box mechanism – in fact, she has numerous packages sitting unopened in her house. She is compelled by a sense of competition; Labubus can sell out quickly online, and Bethan prides herself on tracking down sellers to get her hands on new releases. “For me, it’s getting them before everybody else … at a low price before they go up,” she says.Labubu for life: how did a viral doll become a ‘social currency’? Just ask these diehard fansRead moreAs problematic as these compulsive behaviours can be, they could be exacerbated by new ways of shopping. Pop Mart runs a number of channels onTikTokwhere it drops new products in live streams, forcing consumers to scramble to add them to their carts. “I genuinely spent three weeks every day trying to get one Labubu,” Jess says, “I’ll never forget feeling how I felt when I got one.”Another app, Whatnot, hosts live stream auctions where people bid on collectibles and other products – it’s currently the 15th most popular free iPhone app. Eddie says Whatnot exacerbated his problem spending. “The hosts and the chat make these kind of shopping events more fun but also parasocial,” he says. “You see other people spending even more than you.” Eddie found it hard to keep track of his spending inside the app: “I never saw an overall total from a shop until my order arrived at my house.”Lee, the marketing expert, says “scarcity marketing” like this can be very psychologically compelling. He argues that time limits on drops and auctions can create a “fear of missing out”, compelling consumers to act impulsively.Defenders of blind boxes note that baseball cards have been around for over a century – and millennials bought mystery playing cards or stickers as kids. Yet, Lee says, what has changed now is the amount of money at stake and how easy it is to spend that money using digital platforms. While a pack of Pokémon cards might have cost a few dollars in the 1990s, most of the blind boxes offered on Pop Mart’s website range in price from $15-$26 – though the most expensive one currently available is nearly $300.View image in fullscreenBlind boxes of Labubu dolls at a Pop Mart store in Shenzhen, China, in June.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesBethan says she has “cut back” on blind boxes, but has not stopped. Andersson last spent money in Fifa a month before we spoke, while Eddie is now trying to stay away from blind boxes. Nguyen has managed to recoup her money by reselling her collection online during the peak of Labubu popularity, but she still has unpopular ones sitting around that she cannot sell.Jess faces similar problems – she has tried to sell some of the Labubu figurines she does not like online but has found no one else likes them either. “They’re definitely not in as high demand as they were at the start of this year.” Jess is now prepared to sell her toys for half of what she paid for them. Yet although she now has “quite a large collection of stuff and nowhere to put it”, she is still buying more blind boxes. Her ultimate aim is to cut down to one box a month.Most of the people I speak to would like to see greater regulation of blind boxes, although when I first bring up the idea, Jess admits: “My first reaction was: ‘No! Please don’t take these away from me.’” But she does believe blind boxes are akin to gambling, so suggests there should be “greater warnings about what you could be sucked into”.“I definitely convinced myself at the start that it wasn’t something that could could hurt me, because of the nature of collecting cute things,” she says. “But it’s very underhanded, how it can affect you without you realizing.”Explore more on these topicsToysShopping tripsTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means payment and swag – all she’s had is a free pen. “I really do it for myself,” she says, “and for the people who follow me”.Lerner, 64, has for 20yearsworked as a literary agent for writers including Patti Smith and Temple Grandin. She’s an author of nonfiction and now of a debut novel, Shred Sisters – “a love letter to loneliness”. But the “doing” she’s talking about is on TikTok,where she has amassed 1.5m likesfor videos in which she reads from the diaries she wrote in her turbulent 20s.“You don’t know who you’ll love, who will love you, what you will do for work, what is your purpose,” she says in one post. “This morning I found one line in my diary that just sums [your 20s] up: ‘I feel as if I don’t know who I am, today.’”Lerner posts in her dressing gown, without makeup. Initially she explored BookTok to support her authors. But with her own novel forthcoming, she started posting, camera off, and got no followers. “A friend told me, you need to be on camera and think of it as your own TV channel … I thought, ‘Well, maybe I will read from my old diaries.’”She’d kept one from the age of 11, after reading Anne Frank’s The Diary of a Young Girl. “I wrote my first poems in there. I vented. I tried to analyse myself …” Her journals from the ages of 12 to 18 were lost when her car was stolen, but those from her 20s – about 30 volumes – were stowed in a crawl space in her attic.“My diaries are very sad. They’re all about being lonely, looking for love, looking for friendship, trying to figure out who I was,” she says.Lerner describes herself as “a late bloomer”. She was accepted on to Columbia’s MFA poetry programme at 26, entering publishing in her late 20s when most editorial assistants were fresh from college. “I didn’t fall in love till I was 30. I’d never had any significant relationships … I lost a lot of my teenage years and most of my 20s struggling with depression.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s all about trying to connect and communicate’ … Betsy Lerner, photographed in New Haven, Connecticut.Photograph: Nicole Frappier/The GuardianWhen she was 15, her parents had taken her to a psychiatrist, and she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. “I didn’t want to accept that I had this illness. I fought it a lot,” she says. Her 2003 memoir,Food and Loathing, documents her relationship with her weight, food, depression and more, and at one point in her late 20s describes her straddling a ledge on a bridge above the Hudson River.The turning point came at 30. She found a psychopharmacologist – who “figured out” the right lithium dosage (they’ve worked together for 35 years) – and she got married.Her diaries stopped. She had written them alone in bed at night. But now, “I just didn’t feel that sad and lonely any more”, she says.For years, Lerner says, “I gravitated toward a lot of intensity.” Now, “I prioritise stability over everything.”She had never thought she’d write a novel. But in 2019she came through “four very tragic deaths”. She lost her mother, then her teenage niece and nephew,Ruby and Hart Campbell, who were killed by a drunk driver, and her best friend, the writer George Hodgman, whodied by suicide. “I still don’t know who I’m grieving for at any given time,” she says.In the aftermath of these deaths she started to write Shred Sisters, partly inspired by the online workouts – shredding – she and her two sisters did during Covid to take care of each other, and as “a way of working through all of that grief”. She is already writing another novel, and for as long as there is material in the diaries, and there is TikTok, she will continue to share them. “It’s all about trying to connect and communicate,” she says.“There’s a constant stream of comments from kids in their 20s who identify with my struggles. That’s really what keeps me going. I feel this connection to these kids … I try to say, I felt the same. Hang in. Some heart emojis. Just a little something to say, ‘You’re recognised.’”Shred Sistersis out now, published by Verve Books. To support the Guardian, order a copy from the Guardian bookshop.

On any given weekday during the recent heatwaves, I could be spotted knee deep in bottles at my patio table, which probably raised a few eyebrows too.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I’ve been writing about drinks for a decade, so of course, I have to drink them. This can be tricky during normal working hours with a 10-mile school run to negotiate, so I do a lot of background research first. I make notes on the nose, any interesting ingredients or production methods, look into recommended serves and read tasting notes before getting into the sampling.I’ll taste drinks any time from about 4pm (driving plans permitting) and make extensive notes so that I have everything I need when it comes to writing without having to drink again. Depending on what I’m testing, I’ll mix up the full drink and just take a sip; if it’s something like wine – or something I don’t like, such as an overly harsh spirit– I will spit it out. It usually takes me a few weeks to get through everything, as I won’t test every day (I do try not to drink every day), and then I will test the shortlists a few times.View image in fullscreenMy test of the best gins involved tonics, cocktails and botanical garnishes.Photograph: Dziggyfoto/Getty Images/iStockphotoTo try to whittle a long list down to a shorter one, I sip everything neat, earmarking my favourites. For the gin test, I tried them in different serves – with different tonics, over ice for sipping, in any suggested cocktails or with different recommended botanical garnishes – and against similar gins to make sure they really were the best. I fell in love with the Hernö gins that I tried (Old Tom,Six RiversandJuniper Cask). When testing things that aren’t easy to compare like for like – such as spritzes – I try to compile a wide range of unexpected styles to hopefully float as many people’s boats as possible.Italicuswas a standout example in my spritz testing, as wasBellamie; high-quality ingredients, light and summery and extremely drinkable.My drinks collection is hefty, as I often return to drinks when compiling my lists, and while I prefer to receive miniatures of samples from a practical point of view, there are inevitably products that I need to rehome. The bottle tombola at my kids’ school is a frequent recipient of weird and wonderful (unopened!) things, and the lucky residents of my part of north London will often find barely used bottles of booze on the waste-busting donation siteOlio.What do I drink when I’m not testing them? Usually whatever white wine is my current flavour of the month, but I’ve got very into cremant, vodka martinis, scotch and old fashioneds. One of the things about testing is that it always galvanises my love of the category; I was a bit over gin before my recent test, but move over chicken wine, I’m now all about G&Ts this summer.This week’s picksTempur Pro Plus SmartCool mattress review: a dream for your joints or too soft for comfort?Travelling this summer?

They are caught by seine netting at dusk just a few miles from shore, and the way they are fished means they’re in perfect condition when landed. My favourite way of eating them is left whole, guts in and heads on, topped with a healthy sprinkling of coarse salt and then grilled – they’re wonderful eaten just with your hands or on bread, but today I offer up two alternatives ways with sardines.Venetian-style pickled sardines (pictured top)You will see these deliciouscicchetti, or snack, in bars all over Venice, where they sit piled high on the counter, ready to be served with a glass of wine or on top of a slice of bread. They make a great starter or light supper, and it’s a very good way to preserve the fresh fish for a few days, because the flavour gets only better with time. I’ve added a few crushed pink peppercorns to the traditional recipe, because I think they add a nice touch.Prep10 minCook15 minMarinate1 hr+Serves2as a starterGood olive oil8 fresh sardines, cleaned and gutted (heads and tails on or off – it’s up to you)Plain flour, for dusting100ml white-wine vinegar2tbsp caster sugar1 white onion, peeled and finely sliced1 tbsp sultanas1 tsp pink peppercorns, finely crushed or blitzed1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsleyHeat 100ml olive oil in a large, wide frying pan. Working in batches, if need be, dip the sardines in the flour, shake off any excess, then fry gently for two to three minutes on each side, until cooked through. Lift out the fish, drain on kitchen paper, then arrange them side by side in a shallow rectangular dish in which they’ll all fit snugly.Mix the vinegar, sugar, four tablespoons of olive oil and 100ml cold water in a small pan, and bring to a simmer. Drop in the finely sliced onion, cook for about five minutes, until the onion is soft and giving, then stir in the sultanas and crushed pink peppercorns. Spoon the pickle mix evenly all over the sardines, finish with a sprinkling of parsley, then cover and put in the fridge to marinate for at least an hour and up to three or four days.Serve at room temperature with bread and/or a nice glass of vino.Sardine butter on sourdough with pickled mustard seeds and cucumberView image in fullscreenA fine spread: Mitch Tonks’ sardine butter on sourdough with pickled mustard seeds and cucumber.I love tinned sardines almost as much as I love fresh ones – they are so versatile and so delicious. When I was a kid, we used to have Shippam’s sardine paste sandwiches with cucumber, and this is my take on that delightful childhood food memory.Prep5 minCook15 minChill1 hr+Serves1-2120g tinsardines in oliveoil, drained1tbsp tomato puree1 pinch dried chilli flakes, to tasteSea salt125g softened butter1 pinch dried oregano1 slice sourdoughJuice of ¼ lemonFor the pickle50g white-wine vinegar2tbsp caster sugar1tbsp mustard seeds¼ cucumber, peeled, cored and finely diced1 tbsp chopped fresh dillPut the sardines, tomato puree, chilli and a pinch of salt in a blender, blitz until really smooth, then add the butter and oregano, and blitz again until well combined. Decant the sardine butter into a clean pot or jar, cover, then chill for at least an hour. The butter will now keep for up to a week.To make the pickle, put the vinegar, sugar and 100ml cold water in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then add the mustard seeds and leave to cook gently for 10 minutes, until they soften and plump up a bit. Take off the heat and leave to cool.Meanwhile, mix the diced cucumber with a big pinch of salt, then set aside for five minutes to draw out some of the excess moisture. Rinse off the salt, dry the cucumber well and stir into the cooled pickle mix along with the chopped dill.Grill the sourdough until it’s nicely charred on both sides, then, while it’s still hot, spread thickly with the sardine butter so it melts through the bread. Serve at once with a squeeze of lemon juice to taste and with the pickle on the side or strewn on top; a handful of rocket leaves would go nicely here, too.Mitch Tonks is chef/owner of theRockfish restaurantsin south-west EnglandThe Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

With a volunteer crew, I gave him a sailor’s farewellSeven years after John’s cremation, I was ready to set him free – with help from Australia’s Volunteer Coast GuardMarie JansenMon 18 Aug 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 20.03 EDTShareI feel the ocean swell beneath the keel as we leave the Mooloolaba harbour entrance training walls, heading out to sea. I was right here 44 years ago, our course set for Moreton Bay.Then, we were aboard Pearl Bay, our beautiful cruising ketch, a labour of love and another dream fulfilled for my husband, John. After a harrowing experience crossing the Wide Bay Bar, we spent a week recuperating in this quiet, almost-deserted harbour, its coast guard “headquarters” nothing but an ageing caravan.Only the harbour entrance is familiar now. The rest has grown and spread beyond all recognition. Today it’s surrounded by mansions and multi-storey holiday apartments, and filled to capacity with boats; an endless forest of masts and rigging. The weather is fine and the seas have eased, but this time I’m not on Pearl Bay and John is not at the helm. Instead, John’s ashes are beside me. They’re in a biodegradable box I’ve covered with photographs of each of the beautiful yachts he built. Adorning the lid is the only epitaph that seemed to fit: “Cosmos Mariner, Destination Unknown.” It’s resting in a basket of yellow rose petals.View image in fullscreenThe QF6 Mooloolaba Coast Guard setting out to give a sailor’s farewell to Marie Jansen’s husband JohnOn our first trip out of Mooloolaba harbour, John was jubilant. He was born a restless soul, saltwater in his veins and distant oceans in his dreams. As a child in Amsterdam in the 1940s, his beloved “toys” were the tools he found in his grandfather’s ship’s carpenter sea chest. He ran away to sea as a teenager in the 1950s, signing on to the merchant navy for a string of passages across the North Sea. He migrated to Australia in the early 1960s and was among the first to surf the now-famous Bells beach waves in Victoria. In Queensland in the early 1970s, he taught himself to sail in a little Arafura Cadet, winning the novice championship in his first year at Keppel Bay Sailing Club. Taurus, an Arrow catamaran, was the first of his home-built craft.John’s dreams soon outgrew the bay; the nearby islands beckoned. A Bruce Roberts-designed 18ft trailer-sailer was his next project. We named her Halcyon, and for a while he was satisfied with sailing her across to Great Keppel for snorkelling and picnics on the beach. But in 1978 he spotted an ad for the plans for Peter Ibold’s 35’ classic Endurance ketch. Three years later, having sold our house to finance Pearl Bay’s completion, we were living aboard.View image in fullscreenMarie and John on their yacht, The Pearl BayWhen age and illness caught up with John he switched to hand-crafting model boats and fishing at every opportunity. His death on 5 July 2018 ended our 53 years of marriage – and his lifelong obsession with the sea. John had not wanted a funeral. He had arranged to donate his body to a university’s body donor program, and had been accepted. I learned immediately after his death that the university was no longer able to take him. Too late to find another donor program, my only choice was an unattended cremation. The funeral director handed me his ashes sealed in a basic poly urn. It was not the ending I wanted for him.Seven years later, I was ready to set him free. But how? What would be a memorable, appropriate farewell for an inveterate seafarer? It had to be the ocean, but simply scattering his ashes off a beach – even Bells beach – just wouldn’t do. Then I found the answer: I learned the Australian Volunteer Coast Guard offers memorial services. John had always described members of the Coast Guard as the angels of the sea, watching over the small and not-so-small craft out on our coastal waters.View image in fullscreen‘As we leave the harbour, flags are lowered to half-mast’Whether as boat crews, radio operators or members of the administration team, the Coast Guard give their valuable time to keep us safe. While we’re relaxing, they are maintaining a listening watch on radio calls, undertaking marine search and rescue operations, delivering accredited training and public education courses. And offering memorial services.‘Ephraim will know’: the man who buried 10,000 people has lessons on empathy, loss and the majesty of memoryRead moreWho better to assist with the scattering of his ashes?Briefed on safety procedures and buckled into a lifejacket by the QF6 Mooloolaba Coast Guard, I’m aboard the powerful, distinctive bright yellow vessel Mooloolaba Rotary Rescue. Commander Paul Heath, Chaplain Sue Clarke and today’s crew of highly trained and certified mariners are with me.They are not paid for their service. Staffed entirely by volunteers, this flotilla is funded by donations.We’re clear to head out as there have been no urgent calls for Coast Guard assistance this morning.As we leave the harbour, flags are lowered to half mast. It’s been a naval tradition and a symbol of mourning and respect since the early 17th century, said to make room for an invisible flag – the flag of death – to fly.We pass my sister waving from the end of the harbour wall. Prone to seasickness, she prefers to stay grounded as we make our way to our destination, offshore from Alexandra Headland.View image in fullscreenThe QF6 Mooloolaba Coast Guard setting out to give a sailor’s farewell to Marie Jansen’s husband, JohnI explained to our chaplain that John was not religious and asked if I could write and deliver my own service – a story of his lifelong relationship with the sea. Sue supported me in this request and is close by my side in case I’m unable to go on. Partway through, I realise everyone aboard has gathered around, genuinely interested. Fellow seafarers ask for a closer look at the photos, to admire his creations, so we pass his box around. John would be so proud – he is a real hit!Many hands help me lower the box of ashes overboard and we toss in the petals after. Mooloolaba Rotary Rescue motors in slow circles around the drifting petals before the flags are raised again.It took seven years, but I’m glad I waited to find the perfect way to see John off on his forever voyageAs we make our way back between the training walls and into the harbour, I’m elated. It took seven years, but I’m glad I waited to find the perfect way to see John off on his forever voyage. He would have loved every minute. As I step off the yellow vessel, I’m touched by a fleeting sadness, the feeling I’m leaving old friends.Back home, I find a message from Sue, with a collection of precious photos attached. I hadn’t realised she was compiling a complete record of the memorial service for me. It is a thoughtful gesture that I hadn’t expected, and will allow family and friends to share the day.As I relive the service through the photos, I’m struck by other realisations. I hadn’t expected so much kindness. I certainly hadn’t expected a day of joy rather than tears. I’ll be forever grateful to the people operating QF6. John was right – they are the angels of the sea. Now, thanks to their help, John is in his element at last, free to roam every ocean forever.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleDeath and dyingAustralian lifestyleFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Always creating new plots with twists and surprises, they have been gaslighting cowering customers for years. Here are three acts that should keep you on the edge of your seat.Act IThe scene is Oxford where 90-year-oldABis battling phantoms. Ovo, his supplier, can’t decide whether it has received his monthly electricity payment. After a spate of demands for the £99.62 in question, it concedes, apologetically, that it received his cheque the previous month. Two months later it tells him he owes the £99.62 it has already cashed and adds a £15 late payment fee.WhenAB’s next payment is due he makes it over the phone. It comes to £129.19 and he asks for a receipt. Instead, he receives a letter accusing him of defaulting and demanding £129.19 plus a second £15 late payment fee.ABremonstrates; OVO says it will commence legal action. The card payment is never collected.Enter the consumer champion. Dealing with Ovo is like wrestling ectoplasm. Its first response blamesABfor paying £99.62 by cheque. It claims it was invalid, despite having cashed it. And it says the “cheque” for £129.19 was also invalid, when, in fact, he made that payment by card. Oddly, since it insistsABwas at fault, it says it will “write off” the £238 it says has, by now, accrued on the account.When I query these discrepancies, it claims it never received the £99.62, despite having twice confirmed receipt in writing, and that the £129.19 was only partly settled by cheque, despite a card paymentABsays he made.Back I go again. This time Ovo has a new line. It admits that the second payment was paid by card, but that it left an outstanding balance on the account. And it says it is not writing off the balance despite having told me, in writing, that it is. Instead, it is making a “generous goodwill gesture” for the “inconvenience” caused, although the common theme of its various explanations is that the “inconvenience” was entirely caused by him. By this time, the account is finally sorted, legal action is called off and I think it is all over. But no.A month laterABpays his latest £140 bill by cheque. This prompts three weeks of demands for £140. OVO tells me delays beyond its control prevented it cashing it, and offers to waive the inevitable £15 late payment fee as a “goodwill gesture”. I need a lie down.View image in fullscreenA gas meter mix-up is blamed when an E.ON customer found himself paying a stranger’s bills.Photograph: Paul Melling/AlamyAct IIShepperton, Surrey. A routine boiler service reveals that 81-year-old widowerDGhas been paying for a stranger’s gas since switching toE.ONNext four months previously. A meter mix up is blamed. No one knows who is footing the bill forDG’sconsumption, but whoever it is, they are getting a good deal because he only spends three days a week in the home. E.ON is in no hurry to act.It informs him it could take up to 20 months to get answers because of a long list of similarly transposed meters. It tells me vaguely that his predicament could be caused by “any number of factors” and states, three months after he reported the problem, it is in the “preliminary stages” of its investigation, which it will complete in a “timely manner”. This, the more optimistic customer service agents toldDG, could be within just 18 months or even as few as 14.In the meantime, it asks him to provide regular meter readings to ensure bills are fair. The logic of that eludes me sinceDG’smeter is measuring someone else’s supply. Progress is made – backwards.My interference prompts a technician appointment, only no one shows up.DGhas to wait five weeks for another slot. No one turns up. One day a technician arrives unsolicited. His intervention leavesDGwith no heating or hot water. E.ON says it can’t help because it hadn’t arranged the visit. The problem is eventually resolved a speedy six months after he reported it.View image in fullscreenBritish Gas reneged on its promises to pay back money it owed to a grieving relative.Photograph: Andrew Paterson/AlamyAct IIINow we’re in Worcester.WL’s father, Walter Turner (assumed name) has sadly died. She wants to claim an eye-popping £1,896 credit accumulated on his British Gas account. She has been trying for nine months.British Gas acts promptly at first. It sends a cheque addressed to “Mr Estate of Walter Turner”. Unsurprisingly, it can’t be cashed.Four timesWLasks that it be issued in her name, as executor. Four times British Gas promises to do so, and fails.The happy ending is that the corporate behemoths do empathise with private grief when they’re caught in the media spotlight.

The kids are wearing the khaki safari hats from the welcome packs left on their wooden bunk beds, and we are relaxing on the veranda of our hotel room, with panoramic views of the “savannah”.From this elevated position, we’re studying our neighbours on this 10-day holiday in the south of the Netherlands: Nubian giraffes, white rhinos, antelope, zebras and ostriches, all intermingling on the plain, metres in front of us. The light is fading and a heatwave is enhancing the African theme of Beekse Bergen. In the humidity, our impromptu animal quiz, aided by our in-room brochure, is halted by a low, menacing rumble.View image in fullscreenIt takes a moment for context to overtake common sense. The thunder we think we’re hearing is actually the roar from the pack of lions that live just behind our accommodation. We all fall silent, absorbing one of the primal sounds of nature.It may seem like an unusual place for a safari – close to the modest city of Tilburg and 20 miles west of industrial Eindhoven – but this is a safari holiday Netherlands-style, where you don’t have to fly to Africa to get close to our planet’s most impressive mammals.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s children in a safari hotel room.Photograph: Nazia ParveenThe 120-hectare resort is a group of interconnected sites, comprising a hotel, lodges, chalets and cottages overlooking several open plains full of wildlife; the safari park, which guests can explore on foot through a connecting gate from the resort; a lakeside resort with a beach, more lodges and a campsite for all budgets; and the Speelland theme park – with indoor and outdoor rides, slides and games.The resort hasstrong conservation credentials, with many species that are designated “vulnerable” or “extinct in the wild” protected here as part of a Europe-wide network of more than 300 zoos, aquariums and parks, including Chester Zoo in the UK. The rangers tell us that all the animals living in Beekse Bergen were born here or moved to the park from another zoo; none were taken from the wild.The Dutch have a particular, tailored approach to family holidays, designing thoughtfully for children but without compromising on aesthetic and luxurious touches for adults, and Beekse Bergen is no exception – it’s a hit with our seven-and 11-year-olds, and us parents, too. Custom-made bunk beds in one room, a picture window with views of the animals while soaking in the bath in another: attention to detail and lots to keep the kids entertained.Giraffes lick the roof of our cruiser with their giant tongues and our seven-year-old, amazed, clicks her camera over and overFor anyone staying, there is free unlimited access to the enormous safari park by car, bus or – our favourite – walking trails. Unlike a single costly trip to a regular zoo, we can make repeat visits to enjoy as many of the 100-plus animal species as we can, and at our own pace.Highlights include a magnificent Amur (Siberian) tiger, freestyling ring-tailed lemurs shrieking close above our heads, blustering rhinos locking horns over food, and the quiet grace of the African elephant families.Small “ferry” boats with guided tours (in Dutch) take passengers from zone to zone, via lakes where we get a rare sighting of two iridescent kingfishers – a personal highlight among the more spectacular beasts. By the end of our stay, a battered map covered in ballpoint pen ticks is hard evidence of two children brimming with memories.View image in fullscreenLions live close to the accommodation and visitors can watch their feeding sessionsWe love the birds of prey display, with vultures, eagles, owls and storks swooping low over our heads, catching food thrown for them in mid-air. There are scheduled lion-feeding sessions and we stumble across the seals’ mealtime, laughing as the three blubbery mammals wriggle comically out of the lake and on to the sand.For an extra €17.50 (£15) per person, there is also the option of a 45-minute “game drive” with a guide – ours is the excellent Eva – to get up close and personal, away from the main car trails. We meet alpha male giraffe Jim and his harem, and as the herd licks the roof of our cruiser with their giant tongues, our amazed seven-year-old clicks her camera over and over again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Evenings are for indoor bowling, eating at one of multiple restaurants or relaxing back in the lodge.We visit the Speelland theme park a couple of times – a brilliantly wholesome outdoor and indoor activity centre with fairground-style rides, pedalos in the lake, go-karts and bouncy castles.We pop into nearby Tilburg (15 minutes by car; 25 minutes on a bike) for takeaway pizza, grocery shopping and a day perusing the shops and markets, visiting a traditional Dutch pancake house for lunch. There’s also time for a day trip to Amsterdam (less than 90 minutes by train from Tilburg), where we wander over the canal bridges, meander along beautiful streets with vintage antique stores and hop on and off the tram. Our youngest decides she wants to move to the pretty Dutch capital so she can ride her bike to work every day.View image in fullscreenYou can tour the resort by boat.Photograph: Wieneke HoflandBack at the park, we split our stay between the hotel and the resort. Our first few days are in one of the hotel’s Savanne rooms, geared to guests who want to eat at the resort’s many à la carte, buffet or fine dining restaurants.We then move to a Savanne lodge at the “top” of the safari resort, with a view of the bigger “Masai Mara plain”. The detached lodges are more spacious with full kitchens, ideal for self-catering families. Some even have saunas. While there is a small grocery shop on site, nearby Tilburg has plenty of supermarkets to stock up at.Our tip would be to budget for the significant additional cost of breakfast, lunch and dinner if you stay at the hotel. While the veranda view of the plain from our first hotel room is spectacular, the additional cost of eating out makes the self-catering lodge much more affordable.Is there a specific age where our fascination with animals dims, before being reignited as a parent? I would say for any child pre-secondary school – before the self-conscious cynicism and underwhelmed eye-rolls kick in – Beekse Bergen is a remarkable family holiday, especially for those interested in the natural world.“A safari in the Netherlands?” your friends will ask, intrigued and maybe a little sceptical: “How does that work?” As ever, with Dutch family vacations, it just does.The trip was provided byLittle Clogs HolidaysandBeekse Bergensafariresort.

Squid gameTwo octopuses will face off in a boxing match. Each octopus requires eight gloves. (There is no distinction between left and right gloves.) The rules of octopus boxing stipulate that an octopus must only wear gloves of the same colour.There is a bag containing 16 red gloves and 16 green gloves. Find the minimum number of gloves that must be drawn at random from the bag to guarantee that the colours of the gloves of the two octopuses are(a) the same.(b) different.(c) either the same or different.Solution(a) 31 (b) 24 (c) 23(a) If the lone glove left behind is red, both octopuses can wear green gloves. If the lone glove left behind is green, both octopuses can wear red gloves.(b) Imagine the first 16 choices are all of one colour. You will then need 8 of the other.(c) With 23 gloves, at least 7 are one colour (say red) and at least 8 are the other (say green). If there there exactly 7 red, then both octopuses can wear green. If there are more than 7 red, one can wear red and the other green. (Likewise, if at least 7 are green, and at least 8 are red, we get the same result.)2. Sum-o wrestling.The diagram below represents a multiplication in which all but two of the digits have been replaced by stars. Reconstruct the computation.View image in fullscreenSolutionReplace the stars with letters A to J.View image in fullscreenH must be 1 since F plus the carry of (D+G) must be 10 or larger. In fact, since the carry of D+E can at most be 1, it must be the case that H = 1, I = 0, and F = 9. We also know thanks to the given 1, that D + G = 11. Also, note that E = JNow to the multiplications. We know that 2 × AB = FG = ninety-somthing. So A = 4. And since C x AB = DE, we can deduce that C is 1 or 2. (If it was 3 or larger C x AB would have threedigits.)Suppose C = 1. Then AB = DE, which means that D = A = 4. However, we know G must be even, since G = 2 x B, so D + G is even, but this contradicts D + G = 11. Hence C = 2 and D = F = 9. It follows that J = E = G = 2 and B = 6.View image in fullscreen3. Another boxing puzzleA restaurant uses 4 × 4 and 5 × 5 Bento boxes each divided into exactly eight square sections, as shown in the diagram below.View image in fullscreenThe chef has asked you to create Bento boxes with rectangular boxes. Each Bento must still have eight square sections, even though, as in the example, the square sections do not have to be all of the same size.Design a 4 × 6 Bento box, a 3 × 9 Bento box, and a 5 × 6 Bento box.SolutionHere’s the 4 x 6 and the 3 x 9View image in fullscreenAnd here’s the 5 x 6View image in fullscreenPhotograph: MAA PressI hope you enjoyed these puzzles.

On sale: peanuts, cigarettes, chewing gum, chocolates and chips.When asked how much she made in a day, Palacios’s disabled son Gustavo, who helps run the tiny store, simply laughed. “If we make 100 pesos ($5) it’s a lot,” he said. Happily, said Palacios, the family has a different lifeline.With their house crumbling and bills piling up, the only thing keeping them afloat is a bimonthly transfer of 6,200 pesos ($330) implemented by the government of previous presidentAndrés Manuel López Obradorfor adults over 65.“God bless López Obrador,” said Palacios. “Without him what would we do? I think we wouldn’t even have enough to eat.”Backlash against Mexico City gentrification echoes global anger at overtourism and rising rentsRead morePalacios is one of millions of people across Mexico who have benefited from the welfare policies of López Obrador, or Amlo as he’s commonly known. And now, thanks to a report released last week by the country’s national statistics agency, we know just how effective those policies were.When Amlo took office in 2018, there were nearly 52 million people living below the poverty line: by the time he left office six years later, that number had dropped by 13.4 million, a decrease of almost 26%. Extreme poverty also dropped from nearly 9 million people to just 7 million.In a country that has long suffered from deep inequality and struggled with economic precarity, the steep drop in the number of people living in poverty is a remarkable achievement and suggests Amlo’s policies had a measurable impact on the lives of millions of everyday Mexicans.“It’s something extraordinary, historic, the reduction [of poverty],” said Amlo’s successor and allyClaudia Sheinbaumduring a news conference on Thursday. “‘For the good of all – first the poor’ is not just a slogan, but a reality in Mexico.”Some independent Mexican analysts have been equally enthusiastic about the poverty reductions achieved under Amlo.View image in fullscreenAndrés Manuel López Obrador salutes attendants after his victory in the elections for the presidency of Mexico on 1 July 2018 in Mexico City.Photograph: Manuel Velasquez/Getty Images“There has never been a single six-year term in which poverty has been reduced or decreased so significantly,” said Viri Ríos, a public policy expert and director ofMexico Decoded.“This is a watershed moment for the Mexican economy.”Amlo waselected in a 2018 landslide with a promise to eradicate corruption and tackle inequality. Among the legacies of his administration were the tripling of the minimum wage from 88.40 pesos ($4.75) per day when he took office to the current rate of 278.80 pesos ($15) a day.This had a knock-on effect on other sectors of the economy, according to Valeria Moy, a Mexican economist and director general of IMCO, a public policy thinktank.“When the minimum wage increases, other wages and incomes in the economy begin to rise – even in the informal economy – because there is a greater availability of resources,” she said. “I don’t know if the [poverty reduction] was purely because of López Obrador’s policies, but I do think the push in the minimum wage moved the rest.”Ríos was more emphatic.“We’re talking about a labor market that had a minimum wage well below the standard of living,” she said. “And now it’s reached a level that allows 13.4 million families to escape poverty. It’s a historic achievement.”Amlo also transformed the social welfare system, implementing a system of cash transfers for elderly people, like Palacios, for young people doing apprenticeships and for farmers planting fruit trees, among others. He then doubled the amount spent on these transfers.The universal cash transfer system, which replaced a well-regarded conditional system for the poorest fifth of households requiring children to go to school and families to attend health check-ups, has received some criticism as it meant that, in the case of the pension system for example, anyone, even well-off Mexicans over 65, were entitled to a transfer.“We lost focus and lost the ability to give to the poorest,” said Gonzalo Hernández Licona, the former head of the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL), a now defunct agency which used to measure poverty before the task was transferred to the statistics institute. “While the amount has grown, the way the amount is distributed has worsened.”This might help explain why the 19% reduction in extreme poverty was much lower than the nearly 26% reduction in overall poverty. Many of the poorest Mexicans live in remote rural places, where accessing social welfare is hard if not impossible.“The big problem [with the cash transfers] is not that they’re universal,” said Ríos. “The big problem is that the Mexican government has not made an effort to make it truly universal – that is, to make it reach everyone.”Meanwhile, the report from the statistics agency also revealed other glaring issues under Amlo’s government: while access to food security, social security and dignified living conditions all increased, the number of people without access to health services more than doubled, from 20.1 million people in 2018 to more than 44 million in 2024.“I think the great debt that the Mexican state still owes its people is improving access to healthcare,” said Ríos. “As a percentage of GDP, our spending on health is similar to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.”Palacios, who has considerable medical expenses but no access to medical insurance said she felt “horrible”.“Medicines are so expensive,” she said. “And I don’t have anything.”Sheinbaum admitted there was still more work to do.“Do we still have progress to make? Yes,” she said. “With 30% of Mexico’s population living in poverty, we obviously have to keep moving forward.”Explore more on these topicsMexicoAndrés Manuel López ObradorPovertyAmericasClaudia SheinbaumfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Lungu’s family said he had specifically requested that Hichilema not attend his funeral.On 8 August, the Pretoria high court ruled that Lungu’s body could be sent back toZambiafor a state funeral. Lungu’s older sister Bertha broke down, shouting across the courtroom at Kabesha as she was restrained by other relatives.Lungu’s family then applied for leave to appeal. On Monday, the high court adjourned the case indefinitely while South Africa’s constitutional court decides whether to hear the appeal.Meanwhile, conspiracy theories have spread, from rumours that Lungu is not actually dead to speculation that Hichilema wants to use the body for witchcraft.Many Zambians have joked about the saga. “It’s coming home!” Kodwani Banda, a self-described “youth advocate”,postedto his 356,000 Facebook followers, with an image of white smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel chimney.Emmanuel Mwamba, a spokesperson for the Patriotic Front, Lungu’s party, said: “There should have been more sympathy. When [government officials] came to South Africa, they were just interested in picking up the body and holding the funeral. It was very mechanical. Their approach lacked sympathy, lacked empathy, lacked a sense of Africanness, a sense ofubuntu.”Kabesha had previously argued that a state funeral with full military honours was a legal requirement, citing a court ruling on the burial of Zambia’s first president, Kenneth Kaunda. “The moment that a national mourning is declared, the law kicks in,” hetoldthe Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation in June.Mwamba responded that a state funeral could be held without the current president presiding over it. “His presence doesn’t make it. A state funeral is, in fact, the protocols such as the gun salute, the pallbearers being soldiers, the ceremony being handled by the defence forces,” he said.Sishuwa Sishuwa, a political historian and senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University, said the burial dispute had heightened political discord in Zambia.“The faultlines have always been there, but the dispute over Lungu’s burial place has exacerbated the country’s regional and political polarisation,” he said. “Whatever way the dispute is resolved, it will have a significant bearing on the 2026 elections … A key reason behind the government’s court action in South Africa is to reduce the political costs of burying Lungu in exile.”Lungu ruled Zambia from 2015 to 2021, having taken over when Michael Sata died in office. He defeated Hichilema in the 2016 presidential election, which Hichilema and his United Party for National Development (UPND) party claimed was rigged.The following year, Hichilema was sent to prison to await trial on treason charges after his convoy did not give way to Lungu’s presidential motorcade. Four months later, after an international outcry, he was released and the charges were dropped.Hichilema finallydefeated Lunguin the 2021 elections, amid an economic crisis. Since then, he has been accused of using oppressive methods similar to those of his longtime rival.In 2023,police stopped Lungu from going out for runs, saying they were “political activism” that had to be approved in advance to “ensure public safety”. His wife and children have faced corruption charges, which they have denied and said were politically motivated.In 2024, Lungu was banned from running in next year’s presidential election by the constitutional court, whichruledthat the period from when Lungu took office in 2015 until the 2016 election counted as a full first term.Explore more on these topicsZambiaSouth AfricaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

We’re going to stay strong. We’re going to stay committed to making sure those workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” said Mark Hancock. “And if means folks like me going to jail, then so be it.”Hancock said members want a solution, “but that solution has to be found at a bargaining table”.Flight attendants with Air Canada went on strike on Saturday after months of failed negotiations with Canada’s flagship carrier over wages. Ahead of the work stoppage, Air Canada warned that a shutdown could affect 130,000 people a day.Air Canada flight attendants to defy back-to-work order and remain on strikeRead moreLess than 12 hours after the strike took effect, however, the country’s jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, used her broad powers to impose binding arbitration on both parties – a move the union representing flight attendants decried as unconstitutional.“The talks broke down,” Hajdu told reporters over the weekend. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”Air Canada initially said it planned to resume flights on Sunday, but the union said it would defy the government’s back-to-work order and accused the governing Liberal party of trampling on workers’ rights and setting a “terrible” precedent.“The Liberals have talked out of both sides of their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table. They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,” Wesley Lesosky, a senior member of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a statement.“Now, when we’re at the bargaining table with an obstinate employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and give Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation.”Following an emergency hearing on Sunday requested by Air Canada, the industrial relations board sided with the federal government and airline.“The members of the union’s bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,” according to a directive from the board.The union said it intends to challenge government-imposed binding arbitration in a federal court.If they defy the order from the labour board, union heads can be arrested and union members face the prospect of steep fines.The prime minister, Mark Carney, said it was “disappointing” the stalled negotiations had not yielded a new contract.“We recognize very much the critical role that flight attendants play in keeping Canadians and their families safe as they travel, comfortable as they travel,” Carney told reporters on Monday. “And it’s important that they’re compensated equitably at all times, fairly at all times.”On Monday morning, Air Canada said it hoped to resume flights later in the day, but also suspended its financial guidance for the third quarter and its full year due to the shutdown. The strike is expected to cost the airline tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings each day.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

That is because Bolivia uses two counts: a quicker one, based on photos of each ballot sent to a data-processing centre, and the slower definitive one, where every vote is publicly counted and scrutinised at polling stations before entering the system.The court has up to seven days to release the official results.As neither secured more than 50% of the vote, or at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up, a second round will be held on 19 October.Like the first round, the run-off campaign is expected to be dominated by the economic crisis – the worst in four decades – with shortages of dollars and fuel and rising inflation.Luis Arce, the deeply unpopular Mas president, chose not to seek re-election and instead put forward his interior minister, 36-year-old Eduardo del Castillo, who won just 3.16% of the vote.It is a paltry share compared with the more than 50% that had secured first-round victories for Arce andformer president Evo Moralesin the past – but just enough for the party to avoid losing its legal status, as the threshold is set at 3%.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Paz leaves a polling station in La Paz after accompanying his daughter Catalina to vote on Sunday.Photograph: Freddy Barragan/APSome analysts described the shift to the rightas being part of a broader “rightward turn”across South America, after the victories of Javier Milei in Argentina and Daniel Noboa in Ecuador.But the analyst Gonzalo Chávez Alvarez said the result was a continuation of a well-established pattern in which Bolivian voters swung from left to right – and back again – approximately every 20 years.“It was the same with Morales’s first victory in 2005, when the right had governed for a long time and the population had also grown weary of the country’s political institutions,” said Alvarez, a professor at the Universidad Católica Boliviana.According to the preliminary count, 19.4% of ballots were null and void – far above the historic average in Bolivian elections, which has typically been below 5%.Bolivia’s first Indigenous leader, Morales had spent recent weeksurging his supporters to cast null and void votesin protest against rulings by the constitutional and electoral courts that blocked him from seeking a fourth term.Centre-right business tycoon Samuel Doria Medina, 66, who had led polls for much of the campaign, ended up third with 19.9% of the vote.Doria Medinaacknowledged his defeatand announced that he would back Paz Pereira in the runoff.In the Bolivian press,analysts suggestedone possible advantage for Paz Pereira was that the campaign battle in recent weeks had been concentrated between Quiroga, Doria Medina and the left, leaving the senator outside the main line of attacks – or even of fake news campaigns.Also, polls indicated there were still large numbers of undecided voters before election day.The highest-placed leftwing candidate was Senator Andrónico Rodríguez, 36, who left Mas to run with a small coalition. Having once polled as high as third, he eventually finished fourth with just over 8%.More than 2,500 national and international observers, from bodies including the European Union and the Organisation of American States, monitored the vote and were expected to publish their preliminary reports in the coming days. During the day, they said polling had proceeded normally.According to the electoral court, the election took place without problems, apart from some “isolated incidents”.One of them involved Rodríguez. As he voted in Entre Ríos, a Morales stronghold about 50 miles from where the former president remains entrenched, the 36-year-old senator was booed and pelted with stones by whathe describedas “a small group of extremists identified as supporters of Morales”.View image in fullscreenSecurity guards surrounding presidential candidate Andrónico Rodríguez as he left a polling station in Entre Ríos.Photograph: Jorge Sáenz/APRodríguez had to be escorted by a member of the armed forces to cast his vote. He was not injured. Once seen as Morales’s natural heir due to his Indigenous roots and leadership in the coca growers’ union, the senator was called a traitor for launching his own candidacy.Wanted on an arrest warrant since October for allegedly fathering a child with a 15-year-old, Morales voted in Villa 14 de Septiembre, about 25 miles from thetiny village where hundreds of coca growershave prevented police and the army from detaining the former president.Moralesdenies having committed any crimeand claims the case is part of a plan by the current government to destroy him politically.President Arce, who served as Morales’s finance minister before becoming his main rival, cast his vote in La Paz and said he would ensure “an absolutely democratic transition” in November, when the next president is sworn in.Explore more on these topicsBoliviaEvo MoralesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But without a seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre has been unable to serve as leader of the official opposition, hampering his ability to attack the Liberal government of prime minister Mark Carney.Conservative MP Damien Kurek, a three-time lawmaker, took Battle River-Crowfoot with nearly 83% of the vote in April, but stood down in June to allow Poilievre to run.Because of the federal implications of the vote, the byelection has been overshadowed by a protest movement calling for electoral reform, plunging what might have been a routine vote into chaos and uncertainty.Members of the Longest Ballot Committee have coaxed 203 candidates to add their names the roster, in protest of what they see as poorly structured electoral rules.For the first time, ElectionsCanadawill be requiring voters to fill out a blank ballot with the name of their preferred candidate, instead of printing thousands of metre-long ballots. Elections Canada says votes will be counted even if the voter misspells the candidate’s name.The Longest Ballot Committee did something similar in April, when it put 90 candidates on the list in Poilievre’s Ottawa-area riding, dramatically slowing down the vote count.“If I were one of the 53,684 people in Battle River-Crowfoot who voted for Mr Kurek, I would be angry right now. I would be wondering why someone who had received my vote in three elections would suddenly abandon his position as a member of Parliament for a job as a lobbyist,” Barry Rueger, who is among the 214 candidates contesting the vote, wrote in a piece for theGlobe and Mail.“And I’d be wondering how a candidate who had just been defeated in his own riding in Ontario was supposed to understand my needs, and fill the role of a rural Alberta MP.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

There is a risk of thunderstorms until Wednesday, with forecast rainfall totals reaching about 50mm for Al Hudaydah region in Yemen and the Jazan province of Saudi Arabia.Although 50mm is not a particularly large rainfall total in most places, in this region it is enormous: Al Hudaydah typically records only 65mm annually, while Jazan averages about 150mm.Orographic enhancement – when air rising over mountains or other upland terrain can invigorate or produce areas of heavy rain – along the Red Sea coastal escarpments further amplifies the risk of high rainfall totals here and this, combined with the arid surface conditions, brings a significant risk of flash flooding; runoff from upland rainfall is efficiently channelled into valleys, often toward more densely populated coastal settlements.Hail and strong outflow winds are likely from these thunderstorms, with the outflow winds potentially producing short-lived but impactful intense dust storms owing to the dry desert terrain, leading to sudden reductions in visibility and localised transport disruption.While the impacts are likely to be reserved for the Red Sea coast, there is a suggestion that moisture transferred from the Arabian Sea in association with this tropical wave could extend further inland, with the potential for rare rainfall within the Rub’ al-Khali (Empty Quarter) desert.Meanwhile, Hurricane Erin tracked across the Caribbean over the weekend and is now progressing on a northward path following the US east coast. Erin underwent a rapid and significant intensification phase on Saturday, strengthening from category 1 to category 5, with US Air Force hurricane hunters recording sustained winds of 160mph.Not only is Erin the first of the five named storms this hurricane season to reach hurricane status but it jumped straight to the strongest category of storms on the Saffir-Simpson scale.Thankfully the category 5 status was short-lived, and Erin passed north of Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands on Sunday before adopting the gradual northward trajectory on Sunday night. While theBahamasand the Turks and Caicos Islands have escaped the impacts of the hurricane, many islands over the coming days are expected to face large ocean swells, strong winds and heavy rainfall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It’s not that simple,” another user wrote.China is one of Swatch Group’s biggest markets but, along with many other western luxury brands, it has struggled to maintain growth as the world’s second-largest economy has slowed and consumers have shifted to more affordable brands.In July, the group reported an 11.2% drop in net sales for the first six months of the year. It said the slump was “exclusively attributable” to sluggish demand in China.Swatch is not the first foreign brand to face accusations of racist advertising in China.The Italian luxury fashion brandDolce & Gabbana was criticisedin 2018 after it posted promotional videos showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks to eat Italian food.In 2023, the French brand Dior also caused outrage with an advertisement showing a modelpulling up the corner of her eye.Explore more on these topicsChinaFashion industryAsia PacificAdvertisingRaceChinese economynewsShareReuse this content"

Many feel that the Australian government has abandoned the Jewish community,” the group’s event description read.“Simcha is an excellent speaker and will be sharing words of support for the Jewish community as well as providing an update from Israel.”Ex-Israeli intelligence chief said 50 Palestinians must die for every 7 October victimRead moreBurke has previously barred the entry of other personalities and politicians with a history of controversial or offensive statements, including therapper Kanye West, theUS law professor Khaled Beydounand the former Israeli ministerAyelet Shaked.The progressive Jewish Council of Australia said it had been “deeply concerned” by Rothman’s planned visit, claiming it was “part of an effort to encourage support for the Israeli government”.Bart Shteinman, a council spokesperson, said Rothman’s visit was a reminder of “how shallow and incomplete” Australia’s response to the Israeli government has been.The AJA’s chief executive, Robert Gregory, dismissed the council’s criticism and said Rothman’s trip to Australia was “not connected to current events in the Middle East”.“In general, AJA does not take positions on every statement made by past speakers, but as a community organisation we believe in giving the Jewish community the opportunity to hear from Israeli and Australian decision-makers across the political spectrum,” Gregory said in a statement before Rothman’s visa was rejected.Rothman did not respond to email requests for comment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The motion passed 71-13.Ina social media postshortly after, Rothman said applying Israel’s sovereignty to the occupied territory would make it clear to the world that the land belongs to the people of Israel “today, tomorrow and forever”.Rothman is also the architect ofa bill to formally change all referencesto the West Bank in legislation to the preferred historical Israeli name, Judea and Samaria.Thebill’s explanatory notessay the change will “rectify a historical injustice that was created by foreigners” and “conforms to the general trend of strengthening the Israeli linkage to the region and safeguarding the Jewish people’s historical rights”.Rothman played a controversial role in Israel spearheading amovement to allow a Knesset majorityto override almost any supreme court rulings, and to allow politicians to appoint most of the justices to the bench.The Netanyahu government proposalsparked protests in 2023within Israel in the months before the 7 October attack on southern Israel by Palestinian militant group, Hamas, leading to political instability.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaTony BurkenewsShareReuse this content"

Their presence came amid expectations that Trump would try to bully Zelenskyy into accepting a pro-Russia “peace plan” that would include Kyiv handing territory to Moscow. The Europeans have beendescribed as Zelenskyy’s “bodyguards”, with memories fresh of the mauling he received in February during his last Oval Office visit. So, who are they?Mark RutteSecretary general of NatoRutte has a proven record of flattering Trump for strategic purposes, using language that some allies find cringe-making. In June he referred to the capricious US president as “Daddy” in an attempt to avoid disastrous outbursts at the Nato summit. Rutte has repeatedly praised Trump in public, including in a recent interview on Fox News, and credits him for pushing Nato members to spend 3.5% of their GDP on defence. The US had carried the burden of European security for too long, Rutte has said – music to Trump’s ears.Ursula von der LeyenPresident of the European CommissionVon der Leyen is a staunch supporter of Ukraine who backs Kyiv’s EU membership. For Trump, she is a reminder of Europe’s combined importance as an economic bloc. The US struck a trade deal with the EU three weeks ago, and Trump hailed the relationship as “the biggest trading partnership in the world”. On Sunday she hosted Zelenskyy in Brussels. She said a post-peace-deal Ukraine had to become “a steel porcupine, indigestible for potential invaders”, with no limits on its armed forces.Keir StarmerUK prime ministerStarmer has performed a balancing act when it comes to Trump, keeping him on side while advocating for Ukraine. So far, this tactic has worked. The US president has gone out of his way toemphasise their good relations, despite Starmer’s “liberal” outlook. Both men have an incentive to preserve this rapport ahead of Trump’s state visit next month to the UK. Meanwhile, Starmer and Zelenskyy have developed a warm personal relationship, hugging in February outside Downing Street after Zelenskyy’s previous, disastrous Oval Office meeting, and again last week. The prime minister stresses territorial integrity, which contradicts Trump’s “peace deal” that involves Russia taking more Ukrainian land.Alexander StubbPresident of FinlandStubb represents a small European state but he will be in Washington because he has managed to establish an unexpectedly warm relationship with Trump. The Finnish leader cultivated his access to the US president by hastily polishing his rusty golfing skills before an impromptu trip to Florida in Marchfor a round with Trump, on the recommendation of the Republican senator Lindsey Graham. Stubb’s message on the putting green: you can’t trust Vladimir Putin. Finland sees parallels between Ukraine’s plight and its own history, the Soviet Union having invaded in 1939, saying it needed Finnish territory.Emmanuel MacronFrench presidentMacron combines French economic and military clout with a proven ability to get on with Trump, symbolised by their intense handshakes. In the lead-up to Russia’s 2022 invasion, Macron flew to Moscow to reason with Putin. He has since become a key diplomatic ally for Ukraine. Asked on Sunday whether Putin wanted a genuine peace deal, Macron replied: “No.” He said Ukraine needed a strong army and security guarantees if a lasting settlement was to be achieved. The French president will want to persuade Trump that his post-Alaska-summit plan to stop the fighting is a non-starter, and against Ukraine and Europe’s long-term security interests.Friedrich MerzGerman presidentMerz has cut a sure-footed figure on the world stage since taking office in May, includinglargely holding his own in an Oval Office face-offwith Trump over the summer. He has emerged as a crucial partner for Zelenskyy, who was often frustrated with Merz’s slow-moving predecessor, Olaf Scholz. Berlin has clout as one pillar of the French-German axis at the heart of the EU. It is also a major financial donor to Kyiv. Merz’s task in the Oval Office is to persuade Trump not to act hastily and “over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans”, as he put it last week.Giorgia MeloniPrime minister of ItalyMeloni has broken off from her holiday to fly to Washington, a sign that Trump’s Russia-friendly “peace plan” marks a moment of danger for Europe. She will be a useful bridge in the Oval Office meeting, as a European far-right leaderwhom Trump counts as a friend. Meloni has spent time at Mar-a-Lago, the US president’s Florida home, and was the only European leader invited to his inauguration in January. At the same time, she strongly supports Kyiv’s sovereignty. In July she hosted a Ukraine recovery conference in Rome, designed to help the country rebuild when Russia’s war finally ends.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpUS foreign policyTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

At least seven people were killed in a drone attack on Kharkiv, including a small girl, while three were killed in another bombing in Zaporizhzhia, he said.The Russians were “aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war”, Zelenskyy posted on X. “[Vladimir] Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure onUkraineand Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts.”He said Ukraine required an end to the war, reliable security guarantees, and a just and “dignified peace”, adding: “Moscow must hear the word stop.”Russia’s latest attacks come amid signs that Trump is likely to put pressure on Zelenskyy to accept a peace deal in whichRussiawould gain land it has been unable since 2014 to occupy. The US president has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join Nato or retake Russian-occupied Crimea as part of the negotiations.Hours before he was due to meet the leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the EU and Nato, Trump posted on Truth Social that it was a “big day at the White House”.He added: “We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time. A great honor for America!!! Lets see what the results will be??? President DJT.”In another post on Sunday night, Trump said Zelenskyy could “end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight. No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and no going into Nato by Ukraine. Some things never change!!!”In a video clip recorded from his plane to Washington, Keir Starmer said “everybody” wanted the war to end, not least Ukrainians. But he added: “We’ve got to get this right. We’ve got to make sure there is peace, that it is lasting peace, and that it is fair and that it is just.”Downing Street played down expectations that an agreement would be signed on Monday. A spokesperson welcomed the fact that the US had offered to provide security guarantees, a commitment made public over the weekend by Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff.They would not comment on Trump’s apparent peace plan, which envisages handing the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to Russia, including a fortress-belt of cities Russia has been unable to conquer. The UK was no longer pushing for an immediate ceasefire, Downing Street added.Graph of drone and missile strikes on UkraineThe prime minister and European leaders are keen to avoid a repeat of the public mauling of Zelenskyy during hisprevious trip to the White House, in February, when Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance, accused him of ingratitude and told him: “You’re not in a good position. You don’t have the cards right now.”According to ABC News, Vance will take part in discussions with Zelenskyy on Monday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We all equally want to end this war swiftly and reliably,” Zelenskyy posted on Telegram. “And I hope that our shared strength with America and with our European friends will compel Russia to real peace.”Trump will meet first with Zelenskyy at 1.15pm EDT (6.15pm UK time) in the Oval Office, and then with the European leaders in the East Room at 3pm, the White House said.Even before Trump’s remarks on Sunday, Zelenskyy faced a daunting task of reversing the damage done to Ukraine’s security prospects by theTrump-Putin summitin Alaska on Friday.View image in fullscreenPutin and Trump in Alaska.Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP/Getty ImagesEarlier, Trump accused the media of misrepresenting his “great meeting in Alaska” – an encounterwidely seen as a victory for Putinand a humiliation for the US president.European leaders on Monday will reaffirm their support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and argue against any land deal that rewards Russian aggression. They will also seek further clarity on what security guarantees the US is willing to offer in the event of a settlement. Witkoff has said these would be outside Nato but similar to the alliance’s self-defence pact, article 5.The European leaders will hold a preparatory meeting with Zelenskyy before talks with Trump, the EU said.Yuriy Boyechko, the chief executive of the charity Hope for Ukraine, said the country’s constitution meant it could not legally cede territory to Russia. Putin had offered a “peace deal” Ukraine would be forced to reject, knowing Trump would then blame Zelenskyy and end US support for Kyiv.Boyechko added: “Monday is the day when Ukraine and its European allies must recognise the urgent need to develop their own strategy to defend Ukraine and secure peace in Europe – because it is increasingly likely that Trump will walk away from the peace negotiations.”Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s envoy to international organisations in Vienna, said early on Monday that Russia agreed that any future Ukraine peace agreement must provide security guarantees to Kyiv, but that Russia “has equal right to expect that Moscow will also get efficient security guarantees”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyDonald TrumpUS foreign policyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He will present a detailed account of his version of events before the court.”In June, Høiby was charged with 23 offences, including three counts of rape, by the police prosecutor before the case was sent to the state prosecutor.Høiby is alleged to have raped four women between 2018 and November 2024. All the alleged assaults allegedly took place after consensual intercourse while the women were sleeping. Høiby is accused of filming all the women during the alleged rapes.As he presented the indictment against Høiby on Monday, the state attorney Sturla Henriksbø said: “This case is very serious. Rape and violence in close relationships are very serious acts that can leave lasting traces and destroy lives.”Høiby’s status as part of the royal family, he added, would “not mean that he is treated more leniently or strictly than if similar acts were committed by others”.The maximum penalty for the charges in the indictment is 10 years in prison, Henriksbø said.The state prosecutor, who is understood to have spent the last month and a half deliberating over whether Høiby would be indicted and on what charges, said the trial could take place in January over approximately six weeks.Hoiby does not have a royal title and is outside the line of royal succession. The Norwegian royal court said: “It is for the courts to consider this matter and reach a decision. We have no further comment.”Explore more on these topicsNorwayEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

officials say they have accepted a proposal for a Gaza ceasefire deal that would include the release of half of the approximately 20 remaining living Israeli hostages as part of a phased resolution to the war, as Gaza health officials said 62,000 Palestinians had died in the 22 months of war.The proposed deal follows negotiations between Hamas and Egyptian and Qatari officials that have been taking place in Cairo in recent days, and comes after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was confronted on Sunday byIsrael’s biggest protests of the war, which called for a deal to secure the release of the hostages.Netanyahu has criticised the large-scale street protests against his handling of the Gaza war, and his failure to secure the release of the remaining hostages, claiming that demonstrators were giving comfort to Hamas’s position in negotiations.Organisers of the protests, for their part, have called for a fresh demonstrations this Sunday.Hundreds of thousands of protesters gather in Tel Aviv to demand end to Gaza warRead moreThe latest Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed by Hamas includes a suspension of military operations for 60 days and could be seen as a path to reach a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-long war, according to Egyptian sources.During the period of suspension, Palestinian prisoners would be exchanged in return for half of the Israeli hostages held inGaza.The suggestion of movement in the long-running ceasefire negotiations comes as Egypt – long regarded as a key mediator between Hamas and Israel – has taken a more central role in the talks, and amid threats by Israel to launch a large new military offensive to take control of Gaza City, potentially displacing up to 1 million Palestinians.The proposal was expected to be presented to Israel on Monday, although Netanyahu has said Israel is no longer interested in part deals, saying it will only agree to end the war if Hamas releases all of the hostages at once, disarms, and allows for the demilitarisation of Gaza.Realistically, however, the latest round of talks – which Arab mediators suggest has gone a long way towards meeting previous Israeli objections, and is based on a US-proposed framework – is bound to feed into a febrile political situation in Israel, which is facing growing and acrimonious social and political divisions.1:33Israel protests erupt nationwide to demand end of Gaza war – videoNetanyahu has faced high-profile pushback from senior security officials who have warned that the lives of the remaining hostages could be in peril in the event of a new offensive to take Gaza City, warnings that have fed into the mass protests.The Israeli government’s plan to seize control of Gaza City has stirred alarm at home and abroad, as it has come under intensifying international pressure over growing starvation in Gaza, which it is blamed for, and accusations of genocide.Talks have been continuing in Egypt with participants including the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, the head of Egypt’s general intelligence service, and representatives of the Palestinian factions in Gaza, who are under pressure to reach a deal.While Netanyahu received the backing of the US president, Donald Trump, on Monday for “confronting and defeating Hamas”, the vast scale of the demonstrations in Israel on Sunday – involving more than 400,000 people – suggested an increasing weariness in the country over the war and fury about missed opportunities to secure the hostages’ release.In response to the protests, Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, accused those participating of giving comfort to Hamas.He said in a statement: “The people who are calling today for the war’s end without Hamas’s defeat are not only toughening Hamas’s stance and distancing our hostages’ release, they are also ensuring that the atrocities of October 7 will recur time and again, and that our sons and daughters will have to fight time and again in an endless war.“Therefore, in order to advance our hostages’ release and to ensure thatGazano longer poses a threat to Israel, we have to finish the job and defeat Hamas.”Israeli plan to displace 1 million Palestinians spreads fear in GazaRead moreWith 50 hostages still held in Gaza – of whom about 20 are believed to be alive – some of those attending the march carried signs referencing the death of the dual US-Israeli citizenHersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed by his captors last October along with five other hostages as Israeli troops approached the place where they were being held.Placards repeated a sentiment expressed by Goldberg-Polin’s father at his son’s funeral – “May your memory be a revolution” – adapting the familiar Jewish expression of condolence: “May your memory be a blessing.”Responding to Netanyahu’s remarks, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum lambasted the Israeli prime minister, saying: “They have been languishing in Gaza for 22 months, on your watch.”Netanyahu was also fiercely criticised by the leader of the Israeli opposition Democrats party, Yair Golan, as a man who “lies as he breathes”. He said: “The man who time and again refused to eliminate Hamas’s leaders before October 7, who funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar to finance the tunnels and weapons that threaten our hostages.“This is the same Netanyahu who strengthened Hamas back then, and it is he who is strengthening Hamas now as well. Netanyahu doesn’t know how to win and doesn’t want to free the hostages. He needs an eternal war in order to cling to his seat and to escape a commission of inquiry [into the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered the war].”Amid the threat of an imminent Israeli ground offensive, thousands of Palestinians have left their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, under constant Israeli bombardment, for points in the west and south of the shattered territory.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warHamasPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelQatarEgyptnewsShareReuse this content"

A further 156,230 had been wounded, the ministry said.While the day of protest was called by supporters of Israeli hostage families, the scale of the demonstrations suggests increasingly sharp divisions in Israeli society over a conflict that has yet to deliver the return of hostages at a mounting economic, diplomatic and social cost for the country.1:33Israel protests erupt nationwide to demand end of Gaza war – videoWith 50 hostages still held in Gaza – of whom about 20 are believed still to be alive – some of those attending the march carried signs referencing the death of the dual US-Israeli citizenHersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed by his captors last October along with five other hostages as Israeli troops approached where they were being held.Placards repeated a sentiment expressed by Goldberg-Polin’s father at his son’s funeral – “may your memory be a revolution” – adapting the familiar Jewish expression of condolence “may your memory be a blessing”.Responding to Netanyahu’s remarks, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum lambasted the Israeli prime minister, saying: “They have been languishing in Gaza for 22 months, on your watch.”Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, was also fiercely criticised by the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Golan, as a man who “lies as he breathes”.He said: “The man who time and again refused to eliminate Hamas’s leaders before October 7, who funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar to finance the tunnels and weapons that threaten our hostages.“This is the same Netanyahu who strengthened Hamas back then, and it is he who is strengthening Hamas now as well.

Donald Trump wrote on social media: “We will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be.”Amid the threat of an imminent Israeli ground offensive, thousands of Palestinians are leaving their homes in eastern areas of Gaza City, under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south of the shattered territory.Israel’s plan to seize control of Gaza City has stirred alarm abroad and at home, where tens of thousands of Israelis held some of the largest protests seen since the war began, urging a deal to end the fighting and free the remaining hostages.The planned offensive has spurred Egyptian and Qatari ceasefire mediators to step up efforts in what a source familiar with the talks with Hamas militants in Cairo said could be “the last-ditch attempt”.Netanyahu has described Gaza City as Hamas’s last big urban bastion. But, with Israel already holding 75% of Gaza, the military has warned that expanding the offensive could endanger hostages still alive and draw troops into protracted and deadly guerrilla warfare.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuIsraelGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A senior officer asked the arresting officer if he could arrest Pickering under section 12, which could have brought a more serious charge of supporting a proscribed group.“[The arresting officer] said: ‘No, I can’t.’ And they said: ‘Why not?’ He said: ‘Because he hasn’t got Palestine Action written on him. He’s got Plasticine Action written on him.’”About five minutes later, the arresting officer approached him again. “He said: ‘I’ve got good news and I’ve got bad news.’ I said: ‘What’s the good news?’ He said: ‘I’m de-arresting you.’“And I said: ‘What’s the bad news?’ He said: ‘It’s going to be really embarrassing for me.’ And then I walked free, while all the real heroes are the people that are actually getting arrested.”Pickering has made copies of the T-shirt, which he is selling throughhis own websiteto raise money for the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. It has sold in 28 countries already.“So there’s people getting on this one, because it kind of works, doesn’t it?” he said. “It’s like we are just going to mock you for your ridiculous decision to proscribe a protest group. It’s just so important that our rights to protest do not get diminished.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In June, a Leeds man was arrested for holding up a printed out version of a joke from Private Eye, an incident that the satirical magazine’s editor, Ian Hislop, called“mind-boggling”.Pickering said that although he did care about AI ruining the animation industry, he was passionate about protesting forGaza, and had seen support for the cause swell.He said he felt the tide of public opinion was turning, with more national news organisations showing images and video of the famine Israel wasinflicting on the people of Gaza. “There’s no justification for it, and we all know it. I do think we’re winning. We’re going to win this battle, and Palestine will ultimately – as we’ve been shouting at people for so long – be free.”Explore more on these topicsProtestUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyPalestinian territoriesGazaIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Nearly half (45%) of those polled planned to use credit cards to pay for theirchildren’s school uniformand a third (34%) said they would rely on Klarna-style delayed payment services.Labour says cap on school uniform items could save families £50 a childRead moreThe education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, urged schools to help struggling parents by reducing the number of branded items of uniform that pupils are required to wear as a matter of urgency, before a forthcomingchange in the law.A limit of three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, will be enforced from September 2026 after the government’s children’s wellbeing and schools bill becomes law, but Phillipson wants schools to act sooner on a voluntary basis.“School uniform matters but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” she said. “Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items – and that’s exactly what we’re delivering.Schoolscan help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.”Currently, schools can require parents to buy multiple items branded with a school logo, often from specialist suppliers, with many asking for more than five and in some cases 10 items, pushing total uniform costs up to £400 including PE kit.Under the new legislation, parents will be able to buy cheaper uniform staples such as shirts or trousers from general retailers including Aldi and Marks & Spencer.Nearly nine out of 10 parents (86%) who took part in the poll – which involved parents of children aged four to 15 attending state schools in England – felt that wearing branded uniforms made no difference to behaviour.Parentkind’s chief executive, Jason Elsom, said: “Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride.”Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Many families face wider financial pressures and cannot afford basic amenities. The rate of child poverty in the UK is simply appalling. We hope to see the government publish a meaningful strategy to tackle this issue in the near future.”The government has announced that millions of families will receive their benefit payments before the August bank holiday this year, with payments originally due on Saturday 23, Sunday 24 and Monday 25 August paid early on Friday 22 August.The minister for social security and disability, Stephen Timms, said: “This is especially important ahead of the new school year – no family should have to choose between buying school supplies and putting food on the table.”Explore more on these topicsSchoolsEducation policyEnglandSchool brandingnewsShareReuse this content"

They includeBirmingham,NottinghamandWoking.The Audit Reform Lab at Sheffield said the average cost of external auditors checking a local authority’s finances was now at least £50,000 higher in cash terms than when the Audit Commission was disbanded in 2015.Private-sector accountancy firms took over the job of auditing local government accounts in England after the agency was abolished, in an austerity-driven push by Tory and Lib Dem ministers to find savings and efficiencies.“Ten years on, however, it now seems clear that these reform ambitions have failed,” the authors of the report wrote.“Only 1% of audits were delivered on time in 2022-23, with many audits delayed by several years. Audit costs have risen dramatically in response. An unwieldy, but ultimately operational centralised bureaucracy was replaced by market chaos. The £100m per annum savings heralded by the UK government in 2014 are now a distant memory.”The report found that average audit costs in England had more than tripled – an average increase of 238% – in the year to 2023-24. It blamed most of this increase on private-sector auditors hiking their rates.It compared the large rise in audit costs in England to much smaller increases in Scotland and Wales, where it said there was a much stronger level of central oversight of private-sector auditing.Some of the biggest increases were at financially stricken councils, including a 620% rise in audit fees at Woking, as well as leaps of 470% at Runnymede and 450% at Spelthorne.In total 13 councils had fee scale increases of 300% or more in 2022-23. Birmingham city council paid an audit fee above the £1m mark, representing a 314% increase. The councils were approached for comment.Three auditors dominate the local audit market: EY, Grant Thornton and Forvis Mazars. Others including Deloitte and BDO have exited because profit margins are considered too low, while complexity and risks have risen.EY and Grant Thornton declined to comment. A spokesperson for Forvis Mazars said: “We are working closely with all stakeholders including MHCLG [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government] and remain committed to supporting the return to the delivery of good quality audits for local authorities.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ministers then allowed accounts to be completed with qualifications – whereby an auditor signs off but expresses reservations – to clear the backlog.A new Local Audit Office is also being established to centralise previously fragmented oversight of the process.An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We have taken decisive action to restore the broken audit system, providing £49m to help councils clear backlogs – but we know there is more to do. This is why we will set up a new Local Audit Office to simplify the system and increase capacity by establishing public sector audit provision.“This will ensure the local audit system provides accountability, transparency, and value for money for taxpayers.”Runnymede council said it was on a sound financial footing and did not recognise the fees quoted in the Audit Reform Lab report.Explore more on these topicsAccountancyLocal governmentFinancial sectorLiberal-Conservative coalitionEnglandAusteritynewsShareReuse this content"

The MP met protesters including a woman with a T-shirt bearing the message: “Send them home.”Eddy Butler, a well-known figure in far-right circles who was a key strategist in the rise of the British National party, can be seen wearing sunglasses in the background of one of the photosJenrick shared after the visit.It is not clear whether Jenrick met Butler, but the photo was seized on by far-right figures eager to exploit the protest, which they have heavily promoted.Butler boasted to friends about Jenrick’s appearance in a post on his Facebook account: “At the Bell Hotel, riding shotgun for Robert Jenrick, pretender to the Tory leadership.”ALabourparty spokesperson described Jenrick as “a disgrace” for attending a protest “organised by a far-right party”, which was also attended by someone with “a long history of involvement with neo-Nazi groups”.“Jenrick once proudly boasted about ramping up the procurement of asylum hotels when he was immigration minister. It shows, at best, a staggering lack of judgment,” the spokesperson said.“Kemi Badenoch must show some leadership, explain what action she’s going to take against her shadow justice secretary, and demonstrate that she is strong enough to stand up against this challenge to her authority and to basic decency.”A source close to Jenrick insisted that the MP had “no idea” who the formerBNPstrategist was and did not speak to him at the protest rally.Jenrick said in his post on X: “Great to be with peaceful, patriotic protesters in Epping today.“People are right to be fed up of illegal migration. And the crime and billions being wasted because of it.”Lewis Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, which has been organising counter-protests in Epping, said Jenrick was willing to go on protests attended by far-right activists.“These aren’t ‘concerned parents’ or ‘local residents’. Jenrick is fanning the flames of the far right by chasing Reform UK votes – and he’s giving confidence to known fascists.”Butler, a former member of the National Front, has been a prominent figure in the British far right for decades, helping to guide the BNP during the 1990s and 2000s.In 1992 he helped establish a BNP “stewards” group, made up of skinheads and hooligans, to act as “security” against antifascists. This group becamethe neo-Nazi terrorist group Combat 18, according to Hope Not Hate.Explore more on these topicsRobert JenrickImmigration and asylumThe far rightConservativesLabourEssexEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

New protectionsintroduced in July by Ofcom, part of the Online Safety Act, provide a real opportunity to make children’s safety online a non-negotiable priority for everyone: policymakers, big tech giants and smaller tech developers.”The findings are from a nationally representative survey of 1,010 children and young people aged 16-21 carried out in May, shortly before the introduction of Ofcom’s children’s codes in July.The rules introduced by Ofcom have introduced significant changes to make it tougher for under-18-year-olds to access porn websites. Using the same methodology and questions as the 2023 survey to ensure consistency, it found:More young people said they had seen porn before the age of 18 in 2025 (70%) compared with 2023 (64%).More than a quarter (27%) said they had seen porn online by 11. The average age a child first sees pornography remained 13.More vulnerable children had seen pornography earlier.Childrenwho received free school meals, those with a social worker, those with special educational needs and those with disabilities – both physical and mental – were more likely to have seen online porn by 11 than their peers.Nearly half of respondents (44%) agreed with the statement “Girls may say no at first but then can be persuaded to have sex”. Further analysis showed that 54% of girls and 41% of boys who had seen porn online agreed with the statement, compared with 46% of girls and 30% of boys who had not seen porn – indicating a link between porn exposure and attitudes.More respondents said they had seen pornography online by accident (59%) than said they had deliberately sought it out (35%). The proportion of children accidentally seeing porn was 21 points higher than in 2023 (59% v 38%).Networking and social media sites accounted for 80% of the main sources by which children accessed porn. X was the most common source of pornography for children, outstripping dedicated porn sites.The gap between the number of children seeing pornography on X and those seeing it on dedicated porn sites has widened (45% v 35% in 2025, compared with 41% v 37% in 2023).Most respondents had seen depictions of acts that are illegal under existing pornography laws or will become illegal through the crime and policing bill.More than half (58%) had seen porn depicting strangulation, 44% reported having seen depictions of sex while asleep, and 36% had seen someone not consenting to or refusing a sex act, before they turned 18.Further analysis found low numbers of children sought out violent or extreme content, meaning it was being served up to children, not that they were actively seeking it out.The report expresses concern that even under the new rules, children will be able to circumvent restrictions by downloading a virtual private network (VPN), which remains legal software in the UK.The report recommends that online pornography should meet the same requirements as offline pornography; that the depiction of non-fatal strangulation should be outlawed; and that the Department for Education should provide schools with the support needed to implement the new relationships, health and sex education curriculum.It emerged last week that the number of people in the UK visiting the most popular pornography sites haddecreased sharplysince enhanced age verification rules came into force. The data analytics firm Similarweb said the leading adult site Pornhub lost more than 1 million visitors in just two weeks.Pornhub and other major adult websites introduced advanced age checks on 25 July after the Online Safety Act said sites must make it harder for under-18s to see explicit material.Similarweb compared the daily average user figures of popular pornography sites from 1 to 9 August with the daily average figures for July. Pornhub is the UK’s most visited website for adult content and it had a 47% decrease in traffic in the country between 24 July, one day before the new rules came into place, and 8 August, according to Similarweb’s data.A government spokesperson said: “Children have been left to grow up in a lawless online world for too long, bombarded with pornography and harmful content that can scar them for life. The Online Safety Act is changing that.“Let’s be clear: VPNs are legal tools for adults and there are no plans to ban them. But if platforms deliberately push workarounds like VPNs to children, they face tough enforcement and heavy fines. We will not allow corporate interests to come before child safety. This is about drawing a line – no more excuses, no more loopholes. Protecting children online must come first.”Explore more on these topicsPornographyInternet safetyChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

A tractor became separated from its trailer before falling on to the central reservation between junctions 2 and 3 of the M20.Police earlier believed two vehicles were involved in the collision. They have called for witnesses and anyone with dashcam footage of the collision to come forward.The man’s next of kin are aware of the incident and he remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital. Kent fire and rescue service and south east coast ambulance service also attended the incident, and remain at the scene, the force said.The M20 and the A227 remain closed while emergency services deal with the incident, with motorists advised to use alternative routes. Images and footage shared on social media showed a tractor upside down with railings bent in the central reservation.Large queues of vehicles were forming on either side of the bridge. South east coast ambulance service said it was called to reports of a collision involving a tractor and a lorry on the bridge at about 11.20am.Multiple crews, a critical care paramedic and the local air ambulance were sent to the scene. The driver of the tractor was airlifted to King’s College hospital in London, the service said.National Highways said the M20 was expected to be closed in both directions between junctions 1 and 3 into Monday evening for emergency repairs and resurfacing, after damaged caused from the collision and a subsequent fuel spillage.Anyone with relevant information should contact police on the west Kent appeals line on 01622 604100, quoting reference 18-0475.Explore more on these topicsRoad transportKentnewsShareReuse this content"

No one was hit by the bullets.The department provided no other details about how or where the vehicle struck the agents and whether they were injured.The DHS said the agents were conducting a “targeted enforcement operation” but provided no details about why they were targeting the unidentified man. The incident occurred just before 9am in San Bernardino county, east of Los Angeles.‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detainees face abuse and are denied due process, say lawyersRead moreJavier Hernandez, executive director of the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, spoke to the man’s family and provided their account of the incident, a portion of which was captured on video by the driver’s son and son-in-law who were in the vehicle.Hernandez did not disclose the 43-year-old driver’s name, and the DHS did not identify him. Hernandez said the man is from Mexico, has been in the US for 23 years and does not have legal status.The 18-year-old son and 23-year-old son-in-law are US citizens, Hernandez said.On the videos, the uniformed officers are wearing masks and have “police” written on vests. At least one is wearing a hat labeled CBP, for Customs and Border Protection. They approach the vehicle and tell the driver to roll down his window. The driver refuses and one of the others in the vehicle says: “What do you want?”The agents then smash windows on both sides. The driver immediately drove away, and three shots can be heard in the video. The video does not show either officer being struck by the vehicle.The driver called the San Bernardino police department and reported that masked men had pulled him over, broke his car window and shot at him, the police department said in a statement.Police officers went to the family’s home and spoke to the driver. They left without taking him into custody because California law prohibits local police agencies from assisting federal officials with immigration enforcement, the department said.Federal agents later arrived at the man’s home, but the family did not allow them to enter because they did not have a warrant, Hernandez said. The DHS did not respond to questions about whether they had a warrant and were still seeking the man’s arrest.A crowd gathered outside the family’s home in response to the presence of federal agents. The San Bernardino police returned to assist with crowd control, the department said.The man and his family declined an interview request from the Associated Press.The DHS criticized the police department for not arresting the man.“This reckless decision came despite the subject’s outright refusal to comply and his wounding of two federal officers,” DHS said in a statement. “It is yet another tragic example of California’s pro-sanctuary policies that shield criminals instead of protecting communities.”There is no clear definition of sanctuary jurisdictions, but the term is generally applied to state and local governments that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.The Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration has spread across southern California, where local officials say federal actions are spreading fear in immigrant communities. Raids in the Los Angeles region spurred protests and the deployment of the national guard and marines in the city for nearly two months.After an appeals court upheld a temporary order by a district court judge banning indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests, the administration has asked the supreme court to lift the restrictions in an emergency petition.California, which has been a sanctuary state that protects immigrant rights, has been a prime target for federal raids. Earlier this month, the US justice department publisheda list of such states, cities and counties, claiming they “impede enforcement of federal immigration laws” and promising to eradicate the policies through litigation.The state’s protections have not stopped federal agents’ raids, which have continued in the face of local protests. They have also sparked widespread fear in immigrant communities as the arrests have become increasingly violent.On Thursday, a man was hit by a vehicle and killed as he attempted to get away from federal immigration officers who were raiding a Home Depot in Los Angeles county.Previous raids and arrests have involved border patrol agents leaping out of a rental truck toambush peopleand usingexcessive forcesuch as slamming people to the ground or carrying them away. Many of those arrested have reported being injured in the process.Gabrielle Canon contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationWest CoastCaliforniaTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Many experts are dubiousSteven GreenhouseEconomists doubt US duties will bring about a resurgence of US factory jobs, notably due to Trump’s erratic tariff rolloutMon 18 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 12.59 EDTShareDonald Trump’s hugely disruptive trade war is setting the stage for a manufacturing renaissance in the US, administration officials say. Outside the White House, many economists are skeptical.Global trade experts point to many reasons they believe the president’s tariffs will fail to bring about a major resurgence of manufacturing, among them: Trump’s erratic, constantly changing policies, his unfocused, across-the-board tariffs, and his replacing Joe Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach to brandish sticks at the world.“I think [Trump’s tariffs] will reduce the competitiveness of US manufacturing, and will reduce manufacturing employment,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute (AEI). “They’re raising the costs of production to US manufacturing companies, and that makes manufacturers less competitive. There will be some winners and some losers, but the losers will outnumber the winners.”The one thing Donald Trump isn’t saying about tariffsRead more‘Trump keeps changing his mind’The president and his aides insist that higher tariffs on more than 100 countries – making goods imported from overseas more expensive – will spur domestic manufacturing. “The ‘Made in USA’ label is set to resume its global dominance under President Trump,” the White House spokesperson Kush Desaiclaimedrecently.But few economists see that happening. Ann E Harrison, an economics professor and former dean of the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said the erratic, on-again-off-again rollout of Trump’s tariffs has already gone far to doom the president’s hopes of inspiring a huge wave of manufacturing investment.“For the policy to be successful, it has to be consistent over a long period,” she told the Guardian. “People need to believe it’s going to last. Some factories take five years to plan and build. You’re talking a long-term play. But Trump keeps changing his mind. Even over the last six months, we’ve had very little consistency.“The other problem is that he’s old, and no one is sure he’s going to be around that long. These policies need to be consistent, and that’s not happening.”Economists point to another question mark that is causing corporate executives to think twice about building factories in the US. In May, the US court of international trade ruled that Trump’sblanket tariffs are illegal– a decision that is under appeal.Strain, at the AEI, said: “When you add into the equation the erratic nature of President Trump’s tariff regime, when you add the question of its questionable illegality, when you add that none of this is going through Congress, when you add that even when the US secures a ‘deal’ with another country, it’s not really a deal, there are major outstanding questions.”France doesn’t think its alcohol exports will be hit by tariffs as part of the European Union’s agreement to pay 15% tariffs, noted Strain. “That’s a big question mark that would never go unresolved in any regular, traditional trade deal,” he said. “That’s all part of the massive uncertainty we’re seeing.”The Biden administration used deliberate industrial policies to boost several strategic industries, most notably semiconductors and electric vehicles, includinga 100% tariff on EVs from Chinaand 25% on lithium-ion EV batteries, as well as subsidies to buy EVs and build EV-related factories. The policies resulted in a surge in new factories to build semiconductors, electric vehicles and EV components.Biden “said we care about semiconductors and national security, and what he’d try to do is get actual investors to invest in it”, said Dani Rodrik, an economist specializing in trade and industrial policy at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, who predicted Trump’s blanket tariffs will prove less successful in inspiring investment. “If you really want to increase manufacturing and employment in the US, you’d go about it in a very different way, through industrial policies that first identify specific segments you care about.”When China, Japan and South Korea adopted policies to build their electronics and auto industries, they insisted that the corporations that benefited from those policies compete with foreign companies to help make them globally competitive. “For industrial policy to succeed, it has to work to promote more competition,” said Harrison, at the Haas School of Business. “The problem with tariffs is they do just the opposite. They restrict competition.”Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University who worked on industrial policy in the Biden and Obama administrations, said Trump’s tariff rates on some countries and markets – like 15% on the EU, Japan and South Korea – are too low to spur much investment, questioning why a company would build a major factory to circumvent such a duty.“A [semiconductor fabrication] plant, that’s a billion dollars. You need to get a payback and that takes several years,” Helper said. “If the tariffs are 145% [as Trump once imposed on China], that’s attractive for building a plant. But if they fall back to 15%, then it’s really hard to get a return on your investment.”The administration boasts that several of its trade deals have specific commitments to spur huge manufacturing investment. It says its deal with the EU includes a$600bn investment pledge; with Japan, a $550bn investment pledge; and with South Korea,$350bn. Jamieson Greer, US trade representative,wrote in the New York Times: “These investments – 10 times larger than the inflation-adjusted value of the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe after World War II – will accelerate US reindustrialization.”But these supposed pledges have attracted skepticism. After all, this president claimed during his first term that “the eighth wonder of the world” was being built in Wisconsin afterFoxConn pledged to invest $10bnand create 13,000 jobs at an electronics plant. But that promisefell embarrassingly short.Many economists question whether the EU, Japan or South Korea can force corporations to make a specific investment in the US. Indeed, aEuropean Commission spokesperson saidthe bloc had expressed “aggregate intentions” that are “in no way” binding. “These large numbers really sound like window dressing, some round numbers they’re throwing around,” said Harvard’s Rodrik.“Some include investments you were already going to make, and some are aspirational,” said Todd Tucker, a trade and industrial policy expert at the Roosevelt Institute. “Once we’ve had time to evaluate whether the investment happens or not, Trump will be on to the next press cycle.”In recent years, manufacturing employment has been trending downward – not just in advanced industrial countries, but also in China, as new technologies enable factories to churn out goods more efficiently, with fewer workers. That trend raises questions whether Trump’s trade policies can increase factory jobs in the US.‘An island of backwardness’The US is past its manufacturing peak, Berkeley’s Harrison noted. “That was actually during World War Two, and it has been declining ever since,” she said. “I don’t see manufacturing’s share of the economy or manufacturing employment reversing.”She added: “If the question is, are you going to bring about a major resurgence in manufacturing employment, it’s not just unlikely, the answer is no. More and more manufacturing is robot-driven and not done by people.”Auto industry officials in the US complain that Trump’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum have increased their costs and injured their competitiveness. “In manufacturing, for every one job in steel production, there are 80 jobs that use steel,” the AEI’s Strain said. “So putting tariffs on imported steel might help that one guy, but you’re hurting the other 80 people.”Deal or no deal? World leaders walk tightrope in tariff negotiations with TrumpRead moreA study by Federal Reserve economists found that the tariffs Trump imposed in his first term were actually associated witha reduction in factory jobsnationwide, because increased input costs and retaliatory tariffs outweighed import protection from tariffs.Helper, at Case Western Reserve University, warned that the US auto industry would be hurt badly by Trump’s mishmash of tariffs coupled with his slashing subsidies for EVs. “Trump’s policies are setting the auto industry up to be an island of backwardness,” she said. “The rest of the world is going to be making EVs, but we’re going to be focused on making really high profits on pickup trucks that will be bad for the climate and won’t sell in the rest of the world.“We’ll have a great, competitive position in large, gas-guzzling pickups, but we’ll fall further behind in EVs. That’s a very risky and dangerous path.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationManufacturing sectorTariffsEconomic policyUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

We’re going to stay strong. We’re going to stay committed to making sure those workers can do the job they love doing and actually be able to afford a roof over their heads, to afford caring for their families,” said Mark Hancock. “And if means folks like me going to jail, then so be it.”Hancock said members want a solution, “but that solution has to be found at a bargaining table”.Flight attendants with Air Canada went on strike on Saturday after months of failed negotiations with Canada’s flagship carrier over wages. Ahead of the work stoppage, Air Canada warned that a shutdown could affect 130,000 people a day.Air Canada flight attendants to defy back-to-work order and remain on strikeRead moreLess than 12 hours after the strike took effect, however, the country’s jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, used her broad powers to impose binding arbitration on both parties – a move the union representing flight attendants decried as unconstitutional.“The talks broke down,” Hajdu told reporters over the weekend. “It is clear that the parties are not any closer to resolving some of the key issues that remain and they will need help with the arbitrator.”Air Canada initially said it planned to resume flights on Sunday, but the union said it would defy the government’s back-to-work order and accused the governing Liberal party of trampling on workers’ rights and setting a “terrible” precedent.“The Liberals have talked out of both sides of their mouths. They said the best place for this is at the bargaining table. They refused to correct this historic injustice through legislation,” Wesley Lesosky, a senior member of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, said in a statement.“Now, when we’re at the bargaining table with an obstinate employer, the Liberals are violating our Charter rights to take job action and give Air Canada exactly what they want – hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation.”Following an emergency hearing on Sunday requested by Air Canada, the industrial relations board sided with the federal government and airline.“The members of the union’s bargaining unit are directed to resume the performance of their duties immediately and to refrain from engaging in unlawful strike activities,” according to a directive from the board.The union said it intends to challenge government-imposed binding arbitration in a federal court.If they defy the order from the labour board, union heads can be arrested and union members face the prospect of steep fines.The prime minister, Mark Carney, said it was “disappointing” the stalled negotiations had not yielded a new contract.“We recognize very much the critical role that flight attendants play in keeping Canadians and their families safe as they travel, comfortable as they travel,” Carney told reporters on Monday. “And it’s important that they’re compensated equitably at all times, fairly at all times.”On Monday morning, Air Canada said it hoped to resume flights later in the day, but also suspended its financial guidance for the third quarter and its full year due to the shutdown. The strike is expected to cost the airline tens of millions of dollars in lost earnings each day.Explore more on these topicsCanadaAmericasAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

It wasfounded by the restaurateur Nick Jones, who has a 5% stake, although the biggest investor is the US retail billionaire Ron Burkle, who holds 40% of the company.Richard Caring, the owner of the Ivy restaurant chain, has a 21% stake. All three will retain their stakes, as will the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which has 8%.The new investors will pay $9 a share for about 15% of the Soho House & Co shares that trade publicly. The company said the deal implied an enterprise value of about $2.7bn, although that included $700m of debt.The offer leaves the value of its shares – at about $2bn – well below the $2.8bn level it achieved shortly after listing in 2021. The company has traded below $9 a share since May 2022, although it said that offer represented an 83% premium to the price before investor interest was revealed in December.MCR Hotels is the third-largest hotel operator in the US, with more than 150 sites including the High Line hotel and the TWA at JFK airport, both in New York. It isconverting the BT Tower in London’s Fitzroviainto a hotel, after reaching a deal last year to buy it for £275m.Soho House operates 10 locations in London, and 48 that are either open or planned around the world, ranging from Paris and Istanbul to Bangkok and Mumbai. It has four clubs in Los Angeles and three in New York.

I thought that I would improve during the night. It came up worse. I tried to come out and make it at least a small match but I couldn’t handle more. I’m very, very sorry for all of you. I know some of you on Monday maybe had to work or do something else, so I’m very, very sorry.”World’s best ready to sprinkle stardust on US Open mixed doubles | Tumaini CarayolRead moreIn 31C (87F) heat and 57% humidity, extremely difficult conditions but temperatures they have both had to navigate since the early rounds, Sinner looked completely off from the beginning and his condition only appeared to worsen during his five games on the court.Sinner opened the match with a sloppy opening service game, missing three of his first four first serves as Alcaraz eased to an early break. From the start of the set, Sinner looked determined to keep points as short as possible as he lashed out at forehands and accordingly committed increasingly wild unforced errors. Between points, Sinner walked gingerly and his face looked flushed. As the set wore on, his movement and leg drive on his strokes deteriorated.View image in fullscreenCarlos Alcaraz celebrates his victory.Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty ImagesAlcaraz has not always handled himself well when facing ailing opponents, including on Saturday night when he struggled briefly against a sick Alexander Zverev. To his credit, Alcaraz offered Sinner no free points, maintained his own intensity and made himself look incredibly difficult to beat. Down 0-4, Sinner requested the trainer out on the court but after serving a double fault to fall 0-5 behind, he decided it was time to end the match.After the pair embraced at the net, Alcaraz walked over to Sinner’s bench and put an arm around his rival’s shoulders. Sinner then explained to Alcaraz that he had not been feeling well for some time but he had “tried to come out for the fans”. Alcaraz responded: “Don’t worry at all.”Two years ago, Alcaraz lost an incredible match against Novak Djokovic in the Cincinnati final, a match that is widely considered one of the greatest three-set matches of all time. Although he returned to take the title, this was not how he imagined it. With the trophy in his hands, Alcaraz appeared lost for words as he addressed the crowd. “As you said, Jannik, this is not the way I want to win matches, to win the trophy. I just gotta say sorry. I know and understand how you can feel right now. I can’t say anything you don’t know already, but as I say many times you are truly a champion. I’m pretty sure from this situation you’re going to come back stronger. You always do – that’s what true champions do. You really are one. Sorry and come back stronger.”Alcaraz has now won eight ATP Masters 1000 titles by the age of 22 – only Rafael Nadal achieved eight Masters 1000 titles at a younger age.

After enjoying hot starts to begin the 2025 season, the Yankees are now in third place in the American League East while the Mets are a woeful 11-16since the All-Star Break and 4-11 in the month of August.Even though both teams would qualify for the postseason if the season ended today, neither of them are meeting their lofty preseason expectations. With under 40 games remaining in the season, what is ailing the teams that enjoyed comfortable first-place leads earlier this season? And is all hope lost as they enter the last quarter of the season?Mariano Rivera tears achilles during Yankees Old-Timers’ Day gameRead moreThe MetsWhen the Mets signed Juan Soto to a record-setting 15-year, $765m contract in December, they lured the superstar away from the wealthy crosstown rival Yankees and inherited the weighty expectations that come with a historic signing. When Soto started (relatively) slowly over the first two months of the season, the Mets covered for him with some of the best pitching in baseball (a 2.88 ERA through 31 May) and a strong offensive season from first baseman Pete Alonso.When Soto found his usual form in June, the Mets started faltering. Since the start of June, Soto has hit 21 home runs and posted a .408 on-base percentage, but the Mets are a dreary 28-36 in that same time span. The month of August has been an ongoing nightmare for their pitching staff: the starting pitching that anchored the team to start the season has a ghastly 6.22 ERA in August, which has taxed a tired bullpen that added two major pieces (Ryan Helsley, Tyler Rogers) at the trade deadline in July.The Mets’ bullpen is responsible for eightof the team’s elevenlosses in August. Helsley, a two-time All-Star who led the National League in saves last year with the St Louis Cardinals, was brought in to set up All-Star closer Edwin Díaz. Unfortunately, Helsley has stumbled to a 7.11 ERA in his first eight games with his new team. It’s an uncharacteristically bad stretch for one of baseball’s most dominant relief pitchers, and the Mets need him to find his usual form if they want to compete in a loaded National League playoff race.Even with their horrendous run of recent form, the Mets remain one of the most talented teams in baseball and a viable pennant contender. Shortstop Francisco Lindor – who finished second to Shohei Ohtani in last year’s NL MVP race – is one of the game’s most admired leaders and consistent producers. Even after battling through two major slumps earlier in the season, Lindor has already hit 20 home runs and stolen 20 bases for the fifth time in his career.If the Mets want to make their playoffs, they’ll need to play like a postseason team until the end of September. Of their final 38 games, 22 of them will be against teams in the thick of a playoff race (including seven against the division-leading Phillies). For a team that was 21 games over .500 in the middle of June, it would be nothing short of an epic collapse if the Mets were somehow left home in October.‘There was more at stake today’: Brewers’ victory wins burgers for entire city of MilwaukeeRead moreThe YankeesThe Yankees won their first American League pennant in 15 years last season, but theirWorld Series loss to the Dodgerswas a bitter end marred by terrible defense and poor hitting in clutch situations. This year’s team has better balance than the 2024 version – they added top starting pitcher Max Fried, former MVP Cody Bellinger and two-time All-Star relief pitcher Devin Williams after losing Soto to the Mets – but the Yankees still suffer from inconsistent relief pitching and sloppy defense.Aaron Judge is a good bet to win his third MVP award in four years – he leads baseball in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage and times on base – and infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr is, like Lindor, one of eight players this season to hit at least 20 home runs and steal at least 20 bases. By the end of the season, shortstop Anthony Volpe might join them as a member of the 20-20 club. The offense hasn’t been the problem: it has the highest slugging percentage (.430) and more home runs than any team in baseball (195). A lineup featuring Judge, Bellinger (22 home runs this year) Giancarlo Stanton (441 career home runs) will terrify any opposing pitcher.The problem is the pitching staff. Since the All-Star Break, the Yankees have the worst ERA (4.70) of any team competing for a playoff spot and have walked more hitters (110) than any team in baseball in that span. Like the Mets, the Yankees traded for two former All-Star relief pitchers (David Bednar and Camilo Doval), to try to stabilize the struggling staff and push the team into the postseason. While Bednar has adapted nicely (a 2.16 ERA and three saves), Doval has labored to a 6.43 ERA with six walks in eight appearances. General manager Brian Cashman likely envisioned Doval, Bednar, former closer Luke Weaver and Williams vanquishing hitters in the late innings. Instead, the team is experimenting with different roles while trying to fix what is ailing Williams.After three consecutive seasons with a sub-2.00 ERA in Milwaukee, Williams has endured a nightmare opening season in the Bronx, which has seen him lose the closer job before regaining it, only to lose it again after surrendering runs in five consecutive outings over July and August. In 140 innings pitched from 2022-2024, Williams allowed 26 total earned runs and seven home runs. In 47 1/3 innings this season, he has allowed 28 earned runs and five homers. Whether his issues are mechanical or psychological, Williams has not been the pitcher that the Yankees thought they were acquiring this offseason.And then there is the defense. Since their notoriously bad performance inGame 5 of the 2024 World Series, the Yankees’ defense is more scrutinized than any other team in baseball. They might not be as bad as some people say – Volpe is a Gold Glove-quality shortstop, Paul Goldschmidt remains a reliable first baseman and Bellinger is one of baseball’s best defensive outfielders – but someembarrassing blundershave kept that conversation alive. Ultimately, it isn’t a trustworthy unit.The Yankees offense is so good, though, that it’s unlikely they’ll miss the playoffs. The American League is a much weaker overall group than the National League this season, which means the Yankees may very well find their way to a second consecutive pennant. But they’ll need to shore up their pitching and defense if they expect to return to the World Series.Explore more on these topicsMLBNew York MetsNew York YankeesBaseballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Willing? Hewantsto, so there he was on Saturday night conducting his own coronation. With the last touch of Barcelona’s first game of 2025-26, their new No 10 – the player handed a six-year contract and the shirtLadislao Kubala, Luis Suárez, Diego Maradona, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Lionel Messi wore, the kid Spain coach Luis del la Fuente claimed was “touched by the wand of God”, thebaby Messi bathed– scored against Real Mallorca.It was his first goal as an adult; it was alsoexactlyas you imagine it, Lamine Yamal scoring the Lamine Yamal goal that was Messi’s once. He had come in from the right and then, when the ball settled in the corner, went back out again. Where, stopping before the Son Moix stands, he lowered an invisible crown to his head, a statement of intent for this season and beyond.Ligue 1 fans are given unprecedented TV access – but only to old storylinesRead moreAn opening weekend that is not over yet – Elche play Betis on Monday night, Real Madrid face Osasuna on Tuesday – brought controversy despite the introduction of such vital changes to the refereeing structure as calling the officials by their first name and one surname not two, which meantJosé Luis Munuera got blamed in Mallorca instead of Munuera Montero. It brought victory for Rayo Vallecano, courtesy of comical errors from the Girona goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga, and for Getafe in Vigo where Christantus Uche went all original Ronaldo. It brought the capital’s other team to their knees, the new Atlético Madrid ending up like the old one,beaten 2-1 at Espanyol, whose coach Manolo González was once literally employed to park the bus and has never lost to Diego Simeone. And it brought old faces back, then defeated them both, promoted Real Oviedo losing at Villarreal and Levante at Alaves.Above all, though, it brought three moments, three men. Because if there was a coronation in Son Moix on Saturday, a coming of age a month on from Lamine Yamal’s 18th birthday, the night after there was redemption at “the Cathedral” where Athletic Club’s Nico Williams was reconciled with the congregation. And the night before at the Estadio de la Ceramica there was, well, what would you call this? Some kind of perfection, perhaps? On Friday, aged 40, after 12 operations and 10 centimetres taken from his achilles, Santi Cazorla made his first appearance inprimerafor Oviedo, the club he always wanted to play for, the one he first joined at eight and rejoined at 38 on the minimum wage, finally taking them back to thefirst division 24 years later. And he did so against the team that made it all possible in the first place.View image in fullscreenLamine Yamal enjoys the acclaim and welcomes the pressure of emulating some of Barcelona’s greatest players.Photograph: Jose Breton/NurPhoto/ShutterstockSome time in 2015 when he was in the midst of the injury that should have ended everything, skin repeatedly splitting open and infection seeping out, the operations endless and the days when he was ready to ditch it all countless, a part of his arm grafted on to his heel, anew tendon made with rolled-up hamstring, Cazorla was told to settle for being able to walk around his garden – and now he was. Thirty-thousand people were there to see it, all of them standing and applauding, some crying, most singing, as he went on to face Villarreal, where he played his first ever professional game,22years ago. Where he had played 333 more of them and where, he said, they had treated him “like their son”.He had needed them to. Cazorla arrived at Villarreal as an 18-year-old in 2003, forced to leave home when Oviedo collapsed, relegated, dropping two tiers in one go, in debt, abandoned and on the verge of disappearing for ever. Just as the chance to make his debut might have come, a decade after he had arrived, it was taken away again. Villarreal came for him then, a shy, timid boy at the time. When Arsenal released him in 2018, assuming it was all over, they were there for him again, giving him place to train,to try to recover. Which, a stubborn so-and-so behind the smile, he did. He played 86 games and gotanother Spain call at 34.There was just one thing left to do; the one thing he had always wanted to. So, having accepted the pain, ignored the advice to leave it, he returned to Oviedo on a mission: get them back toprimerafor the first time since 2001. It took two years, it took him scoring in the playoff semi-final and final too, but they made it. Where they returned gave it something extra: back among friends, at Cazorla’s other home, something healing about watching him heading on with 10 minutes left of a game that was already lost but for his club against one he helped make great. “This was very special,” Cazorla said.View image in fullscreenSanti Cazorla soaks in the welcome from Oviedo and Villarreal fans before the former’s first game back in the top flight for 24 years.Photograph: Quality Sport Images/Getty ImagesWhich was more than Nico Williams could say two nights later when he came off the San Mamés pitch in the 82nd minute of an extraordinary game, an ovation accompanying him to the bench. “I don’t even know how to describe this feeling,” Athletic’s winger said. He had gone off, the cramp clawing at his calves, having given everything. Athletic were on course to defeat Sevilla 3-2 and Williams had provided two assists, both brilliant, won the penalty from which he scored the other and hit a post. After a summer in which he had appeared on the verge of leaving for Barcelona only to stay,signing a10-yearcontract, and in which the mural featuring him and his brother had been vandalised, he had needed this.There was something healing here too, especially in the moment he scored the penalty, his brother Iñaki, who issomething like his father too, standing there on the penalty spot with the ball under his arm and his hands on his hips, wearing the look of a parent waiting for their son to get home. All around San Mamés they chanted Nico’s name, demanding that he take it, so Nico smoothed down his hair and headed across. Iñaki handed him the ball and kissed him. Nico scored, and all was well with the world. All that was missing was a break in the cloud, a biblical ray of sunshine and heavenly music, El Correo wrote. “There’s a reason I stayed,” Nico said.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAlavés 2-1 Levante, Athletic Club 3-2 Sevilla, Celta Vigo 0-2 Getafe, Espanyol 2-1 Atlético Madrid, Girona 1-3 Rayo Vallecano, Mallorca 0-3 Barcelona, Valencia 1-1 Real Sociedad, Villarreal 2-0 Real Oviedo. Monday: Elche v Real Betis. Tuesday: Real Madrid v OsasunaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There had been a reason to go, too. Lots of them in fact, but one stood out: to playwith his international teammateand newfound best mate,his other “brother”– a younger one this time. The third man to mark the opening weekend, the kid who reached aEuropean Championship final at 16, the youngest Clásicogoalscorer in history, a leaderbefore his timeand set to mark a generation, already the best in the world at 17.Which is a stupid thing to say. Not just stupid; irresponsible. Another young player loaded with pressure, not allowed to just enjoy it. Just leave him alone. Have you forgotten Ansu Fati? But, well, it is Lamine Yamal who says it, Lamine Yamal who embraces it. It is there in the things he says: in him publicly leaving Adrien Rabiot in checkmate. Saying the Ballon d’Or will come, promising to be back for the Champions League, turning to the camera and declaring himself unstoppable. In the cheek, the glint in his eye; yes, the cockiness. The Instagram and a controversial birthday party too, and the bling and things which people throw at him, but he doesn’t care, willing to bring the attention on himself, not hide. “For as long I win, they can’t say anything,” he said, and mostly he does because if it’s there in what he says, it’s there in what he does too.And it is genuinely hard to think of anyone who has done this, anyone whodoesdo this. By the time he got the goal on Saturday night, the game was already done. Mallorca had been two goals and two men down since the first half, two men sent off. Then Lamine Yamal evaded two players, three, four, and bent the ball into the net. El Mundo Deportivo called it his own personal show. It was, Eric García said, the same goal he scores in training every game; it was the same seen in so many games already:the goal that won last year’s titleand a candidate for this season’s best already. You know what’s coming but you still can’t stop it.View image in fullscreenNico Williams had a turbulent summer, with a potential transfer to Barcelona, but showed he had re-established his relationship with Athletic supporters in the opening game at the weekend.Photograph: Ander Gillenea/AFP/Getty ImagesHe doesn’t always take the same route, not least because his ability with the outside of his boot allows him to turn outwards too to drop the ball on a teammates’ head. Here, he had completed more dribbles than anyone, taken more shots and made more chances. He took the free-kicks, too – that’s new. He took two minutes to find a way through everyone and just five more to provide a perfect assist for Raphinha to score, done with an ease that made it look as if he was messing about. It was even his shot that led to the second goal soon after, Antonio Raíllo crumpling to the floor when he blocked it with his head and still down when Lamine Yamal found Ferran Torres who thumped it into the net. It was also an outrageous run from the halfway line to the edge of the area that ended with Mateu Morey bringing him down and getting the first of two red cards.Lamine Yamal had wanted a goal of his own. When it finally came he had just been confronted by Jan Salas. “As soon as that happened, I knew he would score,” García said, laughing at the inevitability of it all. Angering him isn’t a good idea, which is what Pep Guardiola used to say aboutthatguy, yet another echo found. “I didn’t like comparing Messi to Maradona, but Messi didn’t make it easy; I don’t like comparing Lamine to Messi but Lamine doesn’t make it easy either,” Jorge Valdano said. On the opening day of the season, an adult now and ready to reign, Lamine Yamal did it his way again, putting the ball in the net and the crown on his head.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The first question posed to him on this subject was carefully prefaced with the acknowledgment that mixed doubles was probably not his priority in the middle of one of the biggest tournaments in the world. As a grin spread across his face, Fritz interjected: “It is a priority.”Fritz had been asked whether he had any sympathy for the frustrated doubles specialists who had been brushed aside to make room for the transformation of this event. From his perspective, the right players were in the draw. “I’ve seen a lot of people calling it like an exhibition, or it doesn’t count,” he said.“I think this is the strongest mixed doubles field you’re going to see at a grand slam. If the mixed doubles teams that are in come in and win the event, then I’ll eat my words and say I’m wrong, but I think the level is going to be really high.”Iga Swiatek powers into first Cincinnati final with battling win over RybakinaRead moreAfter six months of anticipation, the revamped US Open mixed‑doubles tournament is finally here.Usually the domain of doubles specialists with the exception of the very occasional superstar pairing, mixed doubles rarely generates much fanfare and at the grand slams it has come to represent more opportunities for trophies and prize money for doubles specialists.While the event usually runs at the same time as the rest of the grand slam main draws, this year it will be held in the week leading up to the start of the singles main draw.Sixteen teams will compete in a knockout draw across Tuesday and Wednesday. The first three rounds will be decided in abbreviated four‑game sets while the final will be determined in standard six-game sets. The winners will take home $1m between them, an $800,000 increase on last year. In an era where the top players have largely spurned doubles because of the increased physical demands of singles competition, the ultimate aim of the event is to attract the stars.View image in fullscreenReigning champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori are the only doubles specialists in the draw.Photograph: Julia Nikhinson/APFor that reason, officials at the United States Tennis Association (USTA) already feel like the glittering player field and the interest it has generated has justified the move. The partnership betweenCarlos Alcarazand Emma Raducanu has created countless headlines, but other distinguished entrants include Novak Djokovic and his compatriot Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek with Casper Ruud, and Fritz alongside Elena Rybakina. The only doubles specialist team are the Italian defending champions, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.In a truly meaningful event, the players would be scrambling for the most advantageous pairings. Since the initial entry list, numerous withdrawals have followed. Navarro’s withdrawal actually led Sinner to possibly find an even better partner in Katerina Siniakova, an 11-time grand slam champion. Jack Draper, meanwhile, is now on his third partner, Jessica Pegula, after his previous partners, Zheng Qinwen and Paula Badosa, withdrew from the US Open.Despite how much it has changed, the draw makes for surreal viewing with so many prominent singles players present. The first two lines are particularly noteworthy:Alcaraz and Raducanu have been drawn against the top seeds, Draper and Pegula, meaning the British No 1s are scheduled to do battle on Tuesday afternoon.Over the past few months on the tour, mixed doubles at the US Open has been a popular subject in player lounges at tournaments. Madison Keys, who is paired with Frances Tiafoe, says she has received FaceTime calls from Tiafoe with questions about their partnership, such as on which side she would prefer to play.Even on the eve of the tournament, there is still serious doubt surrounding the participation of some of the most prominent players in the draw. Alcaraz and Swiatek were competing in Cincinnati less than 24 hours before their first‑round mixed doubles matches in New York, meaning they will have an extremely short turnaround after a gruelling two-week event. Alternates should be ready.Quick GuideEdmund announces retirementShowThe former British No 1 Kyle Edmund has announced his retirement from tennis at the age of 30.Edmund won two ATP titles and became only the second British man after Sir Andy Murray to reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2018. He was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years, and also represented his country at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.Unfortunately, Edmund’s ascent into the world’s top 50 corresponded with a knee injury that required three operations and kept him off the tour for almost two years.In a statement issued by the Lawn Tennis Association, Edmund said: “The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries [and] my body is telling me it’s finally reached the end point. Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was. There are no regrets whatsoever.”Edmund, who defeated Novak Djokovic at the ATP Masters in 2018, made progress in his latest comeback attempt but decided the Nottingham Challenger final defeat against Jack Pinnington Jones last month would be his last match.He said on social media: “Of course to beat Novak, probably the greatest player of all time, was a great feeling and probably the biggest scalp of my career. I spent four or five years trying to come back and was never fully able to reach my goal. But over the next few weeks and months it will be a nice time to reflect and spend more time with my family and appreciate the journey.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The excitement from many of the singles players is counterbalanced by disappointment from doubles specialists who feel they have been pushed out of the event. Singles rankings determine the entry list so they did not come close to making the cut. “When two world No 1s in doubles don’t get into the tournament, there’s probably nothing more to say about it,” Siniakova said on Canal+.Ben Shelton, who is paired with the No 1 doubles player Taylor Townsend, is empathetic towards the doubles players’ frustrations. Shelton says: “I totally understand the honour of playing mixed doubles and what a mixed doubles title means, especially to those guys and girls, and I feel for them that they’re not able to play this year,. “At the same time, I understand the business mind of the US Open and what they’re trying to do to generate more revenue, make their event more profitable and have more excitement around it. That’s the craziest lineup that you’ve seen at mixed doubles in your life.”A longtime member of the WTA player council, Pegula questions the US Open’s decision to make such a significant change without properly consulting the players, a common complaint. Communication with players, she believes, could have actually addressed some of these problems. “I felt like that was a really good example where we were like: ‘OK, you guys just kind of went rogue and changed the whole entire format and didn’t tell anybody, and you just kind of did it.’ And it was kind of like: ‘Did you talk to the players? Did you get input, maybe on how it could have been better?’”In the same breath, though, Pegula has expressed her excitement for the tournament ahead.This will not be the defining moment of any of these players’ careers, but they are intensely competitive beings who step on to the tennis court every day with the intention of winning, regardless of the format. For at least 30 minutes of their lives, this event will be a priority for many.Keys said: “I mean, there’s a grand slam trophy on the line and have you seen the prize money? I’m gonna try real hard.”Explore more on these topicsUS Open Tennis 2025Emma RaducanuCarlos AlcarazUS Open tennisTennisUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And perhaps that was true, but they’re a useful weapon to have. Some games are won by overwhelming opponents through superior technical ability and some games are won by organization and hard work, by finding a way to score and a way to keep their opponent out. Arsenal’s1-0 win at Old Traffordon Sunday was definitely one of the latter.Manchester United do not defend inswinging corners well. Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka both excel at taking inswinging corners. In that sense, the fact that the game was decided by United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir’s flap at a Rice inswinger was entirely to be expected. What was less predictable was the nature of the game that followed as United hit the post and David Raya was called into seven saves. Mikel Arteta, quite reasonably, praised his side’s “character and spirit” while acknowledging they had made “mistakes that are very far from the standards that we normally have.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Winning without playing well, though, has not often been the Arsenal way recently; in that sense, there was perhaps encouragement to be drawn from the hard-earned nature of the three points.That they will surely do. A certain rustiness in the opening game is only natural, particularly with new players to integrate. Viktor Gyökeres will adjust at least to an extent to the pace of the game. Martin Zubimendi looked appalled that the swinging arm with which Bryan Mbeumo caught him early on wasn’t penalized, but he will surely learn to handle the knocks and bumps and flailing limbs of English football. Arteta acknowledged it would take both time to get up to speed but pronounced himself satisfied with how they had played. The “mistakes” will be ironed out. A degree of fluency will return.But until then, it’s good to have the set-plays. Arsenal have scored 31 times from corners since the beginning of the 2023-24 season, at least 11 more than any other side in thePremier League. That’s a valuable weapon to have, particularly for a team that has so regularly been criticized for having to dominate a game to win it. In that sense, the win at Old Trafford was a little like Arsenal’s victory over Aston Villa in their first away game of last season, a game chiefly notable for an extraordinary double save from Raya. Praise them for getting the result without playing especially well, for showing what in hindsight might be regarded as the grit of champions, or question why they didn’t play especially well? The answer to that will only become apparent as the season goes on.‘I want to keep this club in the promised land’: Farke’s mission to keep Leeds upRead moreArsenal, though, probably can take comfort and more than a degree of satisfaction from having beaten United away. True, nine sides did that last season, but Ruben Amorim’s side surely won’t be as bad this campaign as they were then. Old Trafford may again become a difficult place to go, as United’s squad settles and the impact of not having to play European football comes to be felt; having got the game against them out of the way early may end up being fortunate.Of the four realistic title contenders, Arsenal had the hardest start and without excelling have three points on the board, which is more than can be said ofChelseaafter their0-0 draw with Crystal Palace. The world champions have a hugely gifted squad, particularly in forward areas but, with Benoît Badiashile, Wesley Fofana and Levi Colwill all suffering long-term injuries, look a little short at the back, while doubts persist about Robert Sánchez. The goalkeeper was perhaps fortunate that VAR ruled out Eberechi Eze’s free kick that flew past him, but the bigger issue on Sunday was the lack of creativity. Upgrading from Nicolas Jackson at centre-forward has not proved an instant panacea.Manchester City were the most impressive of the contenders on opening weekend, with the new signing in midfield Tijjani Reijnders starring in the4-0 win at Wolves. Given the sort of space Wolves afforded them, they will cut teams apart but the openness they exhibited at times last season and again in the Club World Cup has not gone away; better sides than Wolves may be able to exploit that. Liverpool looked at least as open in their4-2 win over Bournemouthand, like Arsenal, were left grateful for their resilience as they scored twice after the 88th minute to secure the three points. They too have work to do in balancing the side and integrating new signings.None of the probable top four were at anything like their best. All will find a greater cohesion as the season goes on. But Arsenal have got one of the trickier away games out of the way.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

It was the coldest day ever and the wind was whipping. There was such a steep slope at Whitby Rugby Club and they had this massive guy playing for them. Whenever he broke the line they always used to shout‘Cannonball.’”Aldcroft, the inspirational 28-year-old leader and lock forward, lets slip a gap-toothed grin as she remembers the scene. “He’d broken the line and, as the full-back, I was the last one between him and the try line. I knew I had to stop him so I dropped my shoulder and just nailed him. I think it stunned a lot of people.”Women’s Rugby World Cup: the definitive guide to the poolsRead moreDid that crunching tackle mark a sea change in attitudes towards her as a girl playing boys’ rugby? “Definitely in respect of my teammates, which was something I really enjoyed,” she says. “I could see they trusted me and knew I could be just as tough as them.”We soon move on to a far bloodier incident, which was even more of a test for the young rugby pioneer in North Yorkshire. “There was a different time, in training, where I collided heads with one boy. He started crying and I was holding it in, telling myself desperately: ‘Do not cry, do not cry …’ Then I got up as quick as I could and was ready to go again. I had to show I was stronger, tougher and could take playing with the boys.”Aldcroft was always “super-sporty” but, before rugby, she also did ballet. “I was not as nimble as other ballet dancers” she says with a little laugh before explaining that she fell into rugby after her brother Jonathan switched sports from football. “I was down there watching him on the sidelines with my parents and the coach was like: ‘C’mon then. Get involved.’“I thought ‘Yes’ and never looked back. The best thing is that, while I was the only girl that used to play there,Scarborough Rugby Clubnow have 50 girls playing under-13s, under-15 and a senior set-up for women’s rugby. It’s changed so much.”There is such optimism and warmth in Aldcroft’s character that it is unsurprising she should regard the next six weeks as another definitive stage in a female sporting revolution: “This World Cup has the potential to change women’s rugby for ever. In England, over the last few years, we’ve been filling stadiums and this tournament will build momentum and so much excitement. If we do win the World Cup, it will change our lives and also all the young girls who are growing from grassroots levels into the professional side.”The England squad has a northern heartbeat and it seems fitting that their opening group match this Friday should be against USA in Sunderland. “The other week we tried to pick a full XV of girls from the north,” Aldcroft says. “We added a couple from the Midlands and just about made it. That’s important because Sale are the only northern club in PWR [Premiership Women’s Rugby].”View image in fullscreenZoe Aldcroft admits her impostor syndrome helps make her tick.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianHer husband, Luke Stratford, is the scrum coach for thewomen’s team at Sale Sharks. Aldcroft smiles ruefully when reminded Luke has said before that she worries about keeping her place, despite being World Rugby’s women player of the year in 2021and after winning 65 caps. “I have this impostor syndrome sometimes, but it makes me tick in a weird way. It makes me feel like I have to push myself again because you see so many times where life just changes quickly.”Aldcroft is an intriguing mix. She carries a searing focus on the field, leading by example, while away from rugby she is relaxed and chatty. Some of her friends in the squad have described her as “the craziest girl” they know. “It’s probably because I’m super-dedicated and, playing rugby, I love the contact that maybe other people shy away from. I really go for it. But, off the pitch, I can be silly and fun and goofy.”Jonny Wilkinson is her inspiration and during his playing career those last three words she uses to describe herself would never have applied to the obsessive No 10 who helped England win the men’s World Cup in 2003. “Years later I read one of his books,” she says, “and that instilled in me a little bit of his mentality. I related to it because I’m a perfectionist and obsessed with winning and being the best. I met him when I was on a tour and from then I was so interested in his way of thinking.”Firefighter, mother, tattooist: three rugby part-timers on their sacrifices to live a World Cup dreamRead moreAldcroft smiles when asked if she told Wilkinson that she carries a knitted doll of him at the bottom of her match bag. “No, because I didn’t have my doll back then. But I always think a little like he did because I’m obsessed with my performance.”I’ve heard that, as soon as she is alone after a game, Aldcroft will watch a recording of the match. “I still do that and it’s always the whole game. My husband’s like: ‘Switch off.’ I say: ‘Just let me watch this and then I can chill.’ I can’t relax until I’ve watched it and seen what I could have done better.”Does she ever feel proud when watching herself? “Maybe more a feeling of relief. I’d say: ‘I’ve been OK, I’ve done my job.’ Maybe when I’ve finished rugby I’ll look back and think: ‘Oh. That was quite good.’”Her most painful match remainsthe 2022 World Cup final against New Zealand– when England started the game in Auckland on the back of an unbeaten run of 30 victories. Aldcroft felt certain they would become world champions: “I wasn’t even nervous because I had absolutely no doubt. In my eyes there was no way we were losing that final.”England were 14-0 up in 14 minutes but, soon afterwards, Lydia Thompson was sent off. Aldcroft was substituted after 29 minutes after a concussion and England ended up losing a gripping game 34-31. “It was a big lesson because you see how quickly a game can change and you have to fight against the unfairness as well. We had a chance to score a try from that last lineout; 99% of the time we would have caught it and gone over, but it didn’t happen.”Aldcroft stresses that “the culture around the team had to change and, sinceMitch [former All Black head coach John Mitchell] came in, we’ve become a completely different team. We’ve worked massively on our culture, on our bond as a team. We were tight [in 2022] but not to the level that we are now. It’s something we’ve really tried to develop as, the tighter you are as a team, the harder you want to fight for each other on the pitch.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We want to have conversations that go into a deeper part of our teammates’ life and know them down to their roots. Knowing what makes each other tick makes such a difference.”Some members of Aldcroft’s squad have extraordinary personal stories – none more so than Meg Jones who, in March, spoke to mein moving detailabout the death of her parents within the space of four shattering months. “Meg is the strongest person I’ve known,” Aldcroft says. “Before her mum and dad died, she stood up and spoke about how her mum was an alcoholic. Lots of people in the room hadn’t known because she’d kept that to herself for so long. When her parents died, it was something she wanted to address with the group and she was completely open. We know when she needs a moment and we support her as best we can.”Jones is the vice-captain, alongside Marlie Packer, and there is also a wider leadership group. “We all have different attributes and different relationships with different people in the team. It brings us together and allows people to elevate themselves and be empowered.”Our conversation moves in different tangents and Aldcoft is amused as she remembers her husband wearing shorts to their wedding. They recently celebrated their first anniversary and she describes how, when they first met outside a nightclub in Gloucester, she was 20. “Luke was in fancy dress, dressed as a woman,” Aldcroft says drily, “in a long skirt and a top bought from the charity shop.”Luke knew she was an England international and, having diligently pursued her, they eventually began to go out and were married last summer. Aldcroft wore an elegant white wedding dress, but her new husband cut a different figure in a sky blue jacket, white shirt, silver bow-tie and navy-blue shorts. “He hates wearing trousers, even in minus conditions,” Aldcroft says. “So that was his one condition – wearing shorts on the wedding day. I had to think what would look good with shorts and as soon as the wedding was done the tie was off and the flip-flops were on. It helps that I’m super-chilled as well.”View image in fullscreenZoe Aldcroft is determined to help grow rugby in England with this summer’s tournament.Photograph: Lionel Hahn/RFU/Getty ImagesIt is almost as distinctive that England’s World Cup captain is keen to become a podiatrist after her rugby career. “This summer I did my foot-health course as a starter and I think I want to do a degree in it. It’s a lot about joint alignment, your gait, and also chopping away scaly skin and sorting out in-grown toenails. My Dad’s feet are the worst. He’s got a big fat corn and I love scraping it out. Honestly, just making bad feet good? I love that.”We return to the serious stuff. England won their seventh successive Six Nations in April. But they nearly blew a 31-7 lead in the final match against France andscraped home 43-42. “That was the best thing that could have happened,” Aldcroft says. “That second half showed we’re not there yet. So this pre-season we’ve really dug in and gone for it. When we’ve got our foot on their throat we can’t ease off.”England, with Aldcroft playing flank, dispatched France with conviction in their final warm-up match before the World Cup,winning 40-6 away from home. It was their 27th consecutive win. They alsobeat New Zealand convincingly, 49-31, last October and Aldcroft picks out the reigning champions, along with France and Canada, as England’s biggest threat: “We know that, when it gets to the World Cup, New Zealand switch it on again. So it’s important we stay ahead of our game.”The Red Roses squad watched the semi-final and final together as England’sLionesses won the Eurosand she says: “It’s an amazing time for women’s sport and now it’s our turn to do our bit and grow rugby in England.”There is just time for one last question. Will England win the World Cup? Aldcroft’s answer is as swift as it is resolute: “I believe that we will.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamRugby unionWomen's rugby unioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

And that was exactly what happened against Arsenal, United starting fairly well, only to concede a corner and fall behind in inexcusably soft circumstances. Usually, André Onana is the man responsible, but in his absence, Altay Bayindir seized the mantle with alacrity. We can be absolutely certain that Ruben Amorim has already told his bosses he must have a new keeper and, though they have already spent heavily, the position must be addressed as a matter of urgency because if it is not, this will continue happening and they might soon be facing questions about whether a new manager is necessary. It is pointless building a swish new house only for the owners to knowingly leave the back door open, get burgled and sack the builder.Daniel HarrisMatch report:Manchester United 0-1 ArsenalView image in fullscreenAltay Bayindir make a mess of an Arsenal corner before Riccardo Calafiori heads home from a yard out.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty Images2Ndoye and Wood spark Forest fireWhen Anthony Elanga departed for Newcastle, Forest knew they would face a difficult task replacing the speedy winger. Numerous potential targets were analysed and availability ascertained but they finally selected Dan Ndoye as the man to come in. The 24-year-old started on the right and caused problems for Rico Henry with his pace and trickery. Although Ndoye is not able to reach the same speeds as Elanga, no full-back will enjoy the prospect of facing the Swiss winger. Nuno Espírito Santo tested his speed by putting him through the middle at one point, getting him to turn theBrentforddefence and offer a different proposition to Chris Wood. A superbly taken header showed that there is plenty more to Ndoye’s game than merely trying to reach the byline and send in a cross. In previous years, Brentford were seen as intelligent recruiters but they are being outshone by Forest.Will UnwinMatch report:Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford3A Bridge too far for VAR?New seasons bring new directives. It is, of course, hard to fault the officials for implementing the laws of the game. Even so, nobody who actually enjoys football can have enjoyed seeing Eberechi Eze’s free-kick againstChelsearuled out because of Marc Guéhi being penalised for straying within a metre of the Chelsea wall while he grappled with Moisés Caicedo. The intervention felt way too pedantic and petty from the video assistant referee. There is talk of a light touch but this was surely too much interference. Eze’s free-kick was brutal and Guéhi’s positioning made no difference to whether Robert Sánchez was able to save it. Let’s see, too, if this law is applied throughout the season. This often happens at the start of a campaign – new tweaks to the laws are made and there is plenty of scrutiny on them early on, only for referees to stop being as stringent a few months in.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Chelsea 0-0 Crystal Palace4Baleba’s presence is pricelessCarlos Baleba, playing his first football for almost a month, showed why he is considered the next jewel off the Brighton production line. Still just 21, he was the player most in control amid an otherwise hurried, bitty midfield battle. Once he departed in the second half, Brighton lost control, and as late as Rodrigo Muniz’s goal came, it became ever more probable as time dragged on. The word from within Brighton is Baleba is resolutely not for sale, Fabian Hürzeler saying afterwards: “Together, we want to go with him and make with him the next step.” Brighton have each player’s pathway planned out, which invariably concludes with an eventual sale. Not just yet, though, at a club where patience is seen as a virtue. Three big summer signings, teenagers Stefanos Tzimas, Charalampos Kostoulas and Tommy Watson, were all made to wait for theirPremier Leaguedebuts. All must trust a process that delivers dividends for individuals and the club alike.John BrewinMatch report:Brighton 1-1 FulhamView image in fullscreenJorge Cuenca tries to stop the impressive Carlos Baleba as Brighton attack.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/Reuters5Walker faces up to fresh survival challengeAlmost 14 years after replacing him for his England debut against Spain in the days of Fabio Capello, Kyle Walker was handed his competitive Burnley debut by Scott Parker on Saturday. The 35-year-old couldn’t do much to prevent either of Richarlison’s goals as his former club Tottenham kicked off the Thomas Frank era in style but showed the kind of leadership that will be required if Burnley are to compete in the top flight. Walker is closing in on a century of England caps and has been selected in both of Thomas Tuchel’s squads so far. He will hope that a season that is expected to be spent fighting relegation will be enough to book a spot at next year’s World Cup. “At his age and the level where he’s come from and what he’s done, of course, this is a totally different project and something he’s not probably experienced this year, what he’s going to face,” admitted Parker of the six-time Premier League winner withManchester City. “But I know Kyle well, and I know he’ll face up to that.”Ed Aaronsskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It had been a long time in the making for the goalkeeper. This summer Trafford rejoined City two years after leaving forBurnleyand 10 years after first joining City aged 12 from Carlisle. There are suggestions City will move for Gianluigi Donnarumma if Ederson departs for Galatasaray as mooted but Trafford, viewed as the long-term England No 1, has staked his claim, saving smartly from Jørgen Strand Larsen when required. “He’s tall, his presence is really good,” said Pep Guardiola. “The fans love having homegrown players from the academy playing for us.”Ben FisherMatch report:Wolves 0-4 Manchester City7Fans have to provide the entertainmentHow sadly emblematic of the modern game that supporters save their most entertaining chants for criticising the financial state of the game.Aston Villafans voiced their dissatisfaction at the governing bodies’ rules (“Premier League and Uefa, your rules are fucked” didn’t quite scan) that dictate they’re not allowed to overspend their income by more than £105m over a three-year period for Premier League regulations, or exceed Uefa’s remit to avoid paying wages at more than 70% of their revenue, which they have done every year since their 2019 promotion. How darned unfair of the authorities. Meanwhile, Newcastle fans applauded their willing workers during and at the end of their gutsy goalless draw at Villa Park before finally giving Alexander Isak both barrels by claiming there’s “only one greedy bastard” as their star striker continued to make himself unavailable to play as he attempts to dig his way out to Liverpool. Will they be having a word with Yoane Wissa, who has been linked with a move to Newcastle and did not play for Brentford on Sunday? If only we had an independent body to help regulate these matters …Peter LansleyMatch report:Aston Villa 0-0 Newcastle8Pensioners and Potter in focusSunderland have more than 80 season-ticket holders aged 85 and over. As a thank you for their support in recent troubled years, the promoted club have given them all free seats for the entire campaign. It’s a wonderful gesture and, after Saturday’s 3-0 home win, all the evidence is that the recipients could be in for a treat. The only caveat is that Régis Le Bris’s skilfully blended team cannot play West Ham every week. With Habib Diarra and Granit Xhaka – two of eight home debutants – shining, goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard and Wilson Isidor suggested a troubled season may await Graham Potter. “I understand the scoreline doesn’t look pretty for us,” said West Ham’s manager. “We have to accept the criticism and we have to do better. We can’t wait for the opposition to give us points.” Potter must hope the improvement begins at home to Chelsea on Friday night. With Lucas Paquetá disappointing in a visiting side for whom only Jarrod Bowen really impressed, the portents are not promising.Louise TaylorMatch report:Sunderland 3-0 West HamView image in fullscreenSunderland’s Dan Ballard is mobbed by his teammates after scoring the second goal against West Ham.Photograph: Scott Heppell/Reuters9Gunners fail to impress at Old TraffordA win over Manchester United is an excellent start to a season; in a similar vein, it is silly to draw lasting conclusions after one game and it is not cheating to score regularly from set pieces. WatchingArsenalat Old Trafford, though, there was little sense that anything has changed over the summer: they were still solid at the back, unimaginative in midfield and uninspired in attack. Viktor Gyökeres will surely score goals, but looked nevertheless like a blunt instrument, able to run channels and physically assert without suggesting he can create for himself or settle games with a moment of brilliance. Of course, it may well be that the goals he adds are enough – Arsenal have not been far away in any of the last three seasons. Yet throughout them all, there has been a sense that, good though they are, at least one other team will be better – and that still remains the case.Daniel Harris10Cherries picked off but ready to growThe problem for clubs whose identity is based on buying low to sell high is that they have always to replenish – and any signing is always something of a risk. It felt Bournemouth’s final league position last season didn’t quite reflect how good they’d been, which in turn felt as though it might have been something of a missed opportunity, as four of their first-choice back five (if you include the goalkeeper) and Dango Ouattara all left. Perhaps they might have been slightly more solid had a couple more of those defenders remained but even though they let in four againstLiverpool, there were enough positive signs to suggest that they’ll be at least mid-table this season. The press remained aggressive and focused enough to unsettle the champions, Evanilson was as big a handful as ever, Antoine Semenyo had an exceptional game and the new left-back Adrien Truffert showed enough to suggest he might be able to replicate the forward thrust of Milosz Kerkez.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Liverpool 4-2 BournemouthExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballManchester UnitedArsenalNottingham ForestChelseaCrystal PalaceBrentfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, of course, this was not a typical national team match.After the Marshall Islands conceded a fourth goal to the US Virgin Islands, the crowd came to its feet, some waving flags. “This is the RMI! Keep your head up!” one fan yelled.Marshall Islands had famously been considered to be the last country in the world without an international soccer team. Now, officially, they have joined the party – an accomplishment big enough that the 4-0 loss in the opening game seemed to hardly matter. The team followed the loss by putting on a good show Saturday, scoring the first and second goals in Marshall Islands history in a 3-2 defeat to Turks and Caicos Islands.Springdale, Arkansas had been carefully chosen by organizers of the first-ever Marshall Islands match. In a quirk of immigration, Northwest Arkansas is home to around 15,000 Marshallese, drawn to the area for decades thanks to a Compact of Free Association (Cofa) that allows Marshallese to enter the US and work legally.That’s why, despite the loss, the team was jubilant after the final whistle, feeding off the continuing applause and cheers from a fanbase simply happy to be represented.“Today’s event means a lot to the Marshallese community, to see people waving our flag and having a team to represent the Marshall Islands has been very touching to a lot of community members,” said Anjanette Anjel, the consul general for the RMI consulate in Springdale. “Everyone is very proud of the team and really excited for the games.”Marshall Islands’ vanishing kit for a team under threat from climate crisisRead moreThat excitement built among the crowd at Jarrell Williams Bulldog Stadium – the home of Springdale High School athletics – until the Marshall Islands national team came out of the locker room for the first time. Then, they let loose.“The roar when the first whistle went was deafening. Singing the national anthem with the people around us was incredible,” manager Lloyd Owers said after the game. “We hope that Northwest Arkansas is home for us for a long time, We’ve been welcomed with open arms and have had such a good experience.”That Owers, who was named technical director of the Marshall Islands in late 2022, and the largely English group spearheading the effort to bring the Marshall Islands into the global footballing community, received such a warm welcome is no small feat.“Marshallese people don’t trust people on the outside,” says Stephanie Takamaru of the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese. They may have good reason not to. While many left the Marshall Islands for the US for economic opportunities, others were forced to leave because of the effects ofUnited States nuclear testingat Bikini and Enewetak Atolls.Now, despite the Cofa allowing Marshallese to legally enter and work in the US, both the consulate and Takamaru’s organization are working with residents who face an uncertain path to American citizenship.“One of the biggest issues we’re coming across right now is Ice has been very active in the area,” Takamaru said. “We don’t have a visa, we only have the I-94, which is your form coming through border patrol saying you’re legal, and the passport.”The setup is unfamiliar to some in law enforcement. Takamaru said some Marshallese have been let go by their employers after questioning. Those challenges, however, have only increased the feelings of solidarity in the Marshallese community in Arkansas and beyond, and the new national team slotted right into the growing feeling of pride and the desire for representation.“We’re all oneness and together when it comes to big events and life events,” Takamaru said. “The national team is getting a huge fanbase out here. That’s really cool to see. Having that on the international level is such a statement for our tiny island.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Arkansas resident Thompson Hertin said he plays a number of sports with his friends but was surprised to learn the Marshall Islands would be represented in soccer.“Soccer is not known for us Marshallese people,” he said before Thursday’s game. “We play basketball, volleyball, but soccer?”The group had just five training sessions prior to Thursday night’s debut and weren’t sure what to expect when it came to a style of play. Some players on the islands typically play futsal and bring different techniques than US-based players who came up in American clubs.“Now that we know how we play in general and our weaknesses as a team, we have a couple days to prepare for another team that has been inFifafor a while,” center back Josiah Blanton said of the next match v Turks & Caicos, in which they would score the country’s first two goals. “The fact we could come out with a 4-0 after never playing was great.”The nature of sports means that a team can only accept losses for so long, but Owers feels his squad should feel happy with the performance and noted it doesn’t need to change much to secure a result in the team’s second match of the Outrigger Challenge Cup.“If it was 20-0 would anyone have cared? Because it was sort of expected. We’ve gone in, 2-0 in both halves. That is unbelievable, and everyone should be so, so proud of this,” Owers said. “Now, we’ve got a different focus. This bit is gone. Saturday, we genuinely come out with different expectations. We don’t come out to make the numbers up, we come out to beat Turks and Caicos.”Even if the wait for the first point and the first win continue past Saturday, the fans in Arkansas will continue to repay the team with support and adoration. It may be atypical, but they’re thankful to have a team that is theirs.Explore more on these topicsFootballFifaUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Moyes said he was disappointed not just with that decision, but with the overall standard across the first round of fixtures.Lukas Nmecha holds nerve to sink Everton and crown Leeds’ return to big timeRead more“I’m obviously going to say it’s not a penalty and I believe it’s not a penalty,” he said of the winning goal. “I’ve been to see the referee. The referee sort of took nothing to do with it, he thought it was to do with VAR, the decision they’ve made. I don’t know what else I can say.”But Moyes did not stop there in his criticism. “I actually think the referees have had a poor weekend in the opening weekend,” he said. “I think there have been a lot of [poor] decisions and tonight’s is another one. The rules are supposed to be that if you keep your hands down to your side and if anything he’s tried to get it behind his back as well.“The ball takes a deflection on the flight as well.

The 27-year-old forward has also been tracked by Arsenal, the club he supported as a boy and played for during his formative years.Eze’s contract at Palace contained a £68m release clause but it expired last Friday. Spurs hope to get him for around £55m plus bonuses. Eze’s previous club, Queens Park Rangers, are entitled to 15% of any profits that Palace make on him. Palace paid around £19m to QPRfor the player in August 2020.Romero has re-signed at Spurs until 2029 and it represents something of a turnaround for him after he was linked with a move away at the start of the summer. The Argentina centre-half has made no secret of his ambition to one day play in Spain and he was of interest to Atlético Madrid. But having been given the Spurs captaincy after the departure ofSon Heung-min to Los Angeles FC, the 27-year-old has re-emphasised his commitment.

Palace have also made an offer of £25m for Tzolis, a Greece international who spent three seasons at Norwich.Oliver Glasner said he expected Eze to play for Palace in the Conference League playoff first leg against Fredrikstad at Selhurst Park on Thursday. If he did, he would still be able to play for another team in the league phase of European competition this season.Marc Guéhi is also expected to feature on Thursday as Liverpool have yet to match Palace’s £40m valuation of the England defender, whose contract expires at the end of the season. Guéhi is understood to be willing to stay at Selhurst Park and leave on a free transfer although the Palace chair, Steve Parish, has admitted that he would prefer to sell the 25-year-old this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The top flight is planning to launch its own anti-homophobia initiative in February to coincide with LGBTQ+ History Month.Prospective football agents to take case over Fifa’s online exam to CasRead moreThe Premier League has no plans to cut ties with Kick It Out, a pioneer in combating racism and championing diversity since forming in 1993 as a campaign group, Let’s Kick Racism Out of Football. Despite making considerable progress in driving racism out of stadiums, black players remain targets for abuse, as was demonstrated on Friday when the Bournemouth forwardAntoine Semenyo was allegedly racially abusedduring the first Premier League game of the season at Anfield.Social media abuse is also rife, with the England defenderJess Carter revealing she received racist online messagesduring Euro 2025. That led to the Lionesses ending their pre-match gesture of taking the knee, after five years, for the semi-final and final of the tournament. The Premier League captains decided last week to continue taking the knee this season, but before only the two games during Black History Month in October.The Premier League declined to comment on its new funding arrangements with Kick It Out, but sources indicated a belief that a shorter deal will provide more flexibility to support specific programmes. The new funding deal is understood to have conditions attached regarding programme delivery, in line with the Premier League’s policy towards funding external groups. Kick It Out also declined to comment.View image in fullscreenRichard Masters is keen for the Premier League to be more in control of its own campaigns on diversity and inclusion.Photograph: Jon Super/APThe Premier League has significantly increased the staff numbers and resources committed to its own inclusion work in recent years. The former Huddersfield and Gillingham striker Iffy Onuora was appointed in 2021 as its first head of equality, diversity and inclusion, with Kuljit Randhawa joining as the head of diversity and inclusion strategy the following year.The Premier League has also set up a Black Participants’ Advisory Group, comprising former players and managers including Wes Morgan, Darren Moore and Chris Hughton, to provide additional advice.“We’re confident enough now to speak in our own voice,” the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, said last week in reference to the Stonewall partnership. “We’re confident to put our own activations together, talking to clubs and stakeholders about it.

In the wake of Manchester United’s 1-0defeat against Arsenalon Sunday, social media lit-up with differing takes from those of a United persuasion. The case for optimism featured United’s 22 shots to Arsenal’s eight and the beginnings of what may flower into an on-field bromance between Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. The case for pessimism: a crisis at No 1, with Altay Bayindir’s timidness leading to Riccardo Calafiori’s winner and André Onana’s ongoing flakiness. Then there is the bottom line: United were defeated. As midfielder Casemiro said afterwards: “I’m not going to say that losing is OK; we have to win. Manchester United always has to win. I think we have shown good moments, and we have played much better, but we have to look for the victory.”New season, same strife between the sticks for Manchester United | Jonathan WilsonRead moreEverything but the goalWithin a few seconds of the game on Sunday, Mbeumo charged down the right wing and then picked out Cunha after hearing the yells of his fellow No 10. Here, then, was a glimpse of how the new boys may gel beyond the weekend, which would have been heartening to see for all United fans. Mbeumo’s skillset features a killer touch, a cut-throat running ability, a calibrated pass radar and an eye for a shot. Cunha has the same abilities as well as a tendency to purr past opponents, as he did in one game-breaking run during the first half. And operating as a No 9, the Brazilian also showed he can be a differing option in that position to Benjamin Sesko. Yet neither Mbeumo or Cunha scored, spurning a slew of chances. This has to be fixed.Sesko needs fast startSesko arrived at Old Trafford on a £73.7m ticket of being a tall, awkward, skilful, fast No 9 and, in a 25-minute debut on Sunday after coming on as a substitute, the Slovenian offered glimpses of those traits. But, as is the case with Mbeumo and Cunha, the heat is on the 22-year-old to tear up defences and stick the ball in the net. United managed a paltry 44 Premier League goals last season and if Ruben Amorim cannot get more out of his newly-established attack then the head coach will be the latest to have his career sucked into an Old Trafford-shaped black hole. Sesko needs to start at Fulham on Sunday and be allowed to show he has what it takes to lead the line for Amorim’s side.View image in fullscreenBenjamin Sesko needs to hit the ground running.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesManaging expectationsAll No 1s are a few bad games away from pressure but in the fevered hothouse of United, scrutiny is a 24-7 occupation. Amorim has spent £200m-plus on Mbeumo, Cunha and Sesko, is in the market for a new No 6 and goalkeeper, and has had since early November to implement his ideas. Oh, and there is no European football, meaning more time on the training ground. What, then, is a reasonable expectation from Amorim’s United this season? No one should expect them to mount a top-four challenge, but a return to continental competition seems a reasonable expectation via an upturn in performance, meaning discernible patterns of attractive and controlled front-foot play. The United results graph for last season read 11 wins and 18 defeats for 42 points, and a goal difference of -10 and a 15th-place finish. This has to be reversed.Six appealAmorim continuing to select Casemiro ahead of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo is a red flag regarding the weakness of United’s midfield department. The player, himself, is content. “I am very happy here,” he toldmanutd.com. “My family is happy here. I enjoy every day at Carrington [the training base] and at Old Trafford. If people talk from the outside, that’s fine, it doesn’t interest me. I just want to focus on winning.” To have a man with five Champions Leagues on the CV is a boon for Amorim as he aims to pull off what proved a sisyphean task for David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Erik ten Hag: to make United great again. And if a No 6 can be recruited before the close of the transfer window, then Casemiro can be eased back to the bench where his experience and professionalism can continue to influence teammates.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

The European court of justice (ECJ) is part of the CJEU.Fifa consider holding Club World Cup every two years from 2029 – and could expand itRead moreThe organisation subsequently amended its rulebook but the one‑time Chelsea player says it has failed to make personal amends and, as a result, he is starting legal proceedings against it, as well as against the Belgian football association.In a statement released through his lawyers, Diarra said: “I have been forced to fight this legal battle since August 2014. That’s more than 11 years! I waited a few months before restarting the national proceedings in Belgium, thinking that Fifa and the Belgian federation would at least have the decency to approach me to propose an amicable settlement of the dispute … This was not the case. That is their right, but it reflects a continuing culture of contempt for the rule of law and for players, despite the crystal-clear message sent by the CJEU.”Diarra is seeking €65m in compensation for what he argues is the damage inflicted by the collapse of his proposed transfer from Lokomotiv Moscow to the Belgian side Charleroi in 2014. With his contract terminated by the Russian club, Diarrawas denied a permit to transfer to Charleroias the rules decreed that he must first pay a fine levied by Lokomotiv, as well as compensation determined by a separate legal action.In hearing the case last year, the CJEU found that Fifa’s rules in the event of a contract being terminated were “contrary to EU law” and that they imposed “considerable legal risks, unforeseeable and potentially very high financial risks as well as major sporting risks on those players and clubs wishing to employ them which, taken together, are such as to impede international transfers of those players”.Fifa amended its rules in December in a move declared insufficient by the global players’ union, FifPro, which is backing Diarra’s latest lawsuit. “The decision to pursue litigation followed unsuccessful attempts at amicable settlement, with Fifa declining to engage constructively to resolve the rightful demand by the player to be compensated for his career losses,” the union said.The news also follows an announcement two weeks ago ofa class-action lawsuit being brought against Fifa, with lawyers estimating that all players during the period the rules were in force could have had their lifetime earnings reduced by as much as 8%. Diarra’s lawyers, the Belgian firm Dupont-Hissel, who are also behind the Justice for Players class action, said they expect a verdict in the case within “12-15 months”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That included candidates left with insufficient time to answer the questions and later finding out that multiple answers had not been recorded. Some were allowed to resit the exam on 30 June, but many were informed they will have to wait until next year and had no right to appeal.Fifa consider holding Club World Cup every two years from 2029 – and could expand itRead moreIn a letter sent last month to Fifa’s general secretariat, the group of more than 40 candidates who were affected asked for a review “based on fundamental and obvious errors in the application of Fifa regulations” that they estimate could have had an effect on “thousands worldwide”.“Across borders and examination centres, candidates encountered severe technical and procedural irregularities that compromised the fairness, transparency and ­validity of the exam,” the letter says, listing several examples including “­incorrect or mis­leading questions” and “multiple correct answers marked as wrong”.“The list of technical issues is extensive and in many cases nearly ­never‑­ending. These ­conditions made it impossible for many ­candidates to complete the exam under fair or standardised conditions. We are appealing directly to Fifa, believing in its responsibility and commitment to justice. We are not an institution. We are students and professionals, volunteering our time in search of fairness. Please do not reject our appeal automatically.”Fifa said it “diligently checked every substantiated complaint regarding technical impediments in the context of the exam” but could not respond further to the letter and claimed the issue had “already been resolved”. As such, the group is now planning to take their case to Cas, where they will request an opportunity to retake the exam before the scheduled date next year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

With the league-owned Ligue 1+ taking over broadcasting duties and with a desperate need to “add value” to the “product”, there was a sweeping range of innovations for the return of top-flight football.Viewers were treated to the France World Cup winner Djibril Sidibé dialling in from the Toulouse dressing room following their win over Nice; the Nantes manager, Luís Castro, providing a mid-match tactical overview during their defeat to PSG; images of raucous dressing room celebrations, of pre-match preparations, team talks, you name it. Stadiums become panopticon prisons, and omnipresent cameras erode any mystery that remains in the relationship between those who play the sport and those who watch it.The “innovations”, by and large, have been well received, and the viewer experience has never felt more privileged, even if some players are unsure. The Nice defender Jonathan Clauss warned against the potential invasiveness. “It’s still our dressing room. You have to find a happy middle ground,” said the France international. But, above all, these measures have been introduced out of necessity. In a league so dominated by one team, it can be argued that they are a replacement for, rather than a complement to, the sporting spectacle.The new season, only one week old, is already repurposing the old storylines.Paris Saint-Germainand their purported closest challengers, Marseille, both played very much to type. The European champions, with just two weeks of pre-season under their belts following their tardy finish to last season, were heavily rotated for their visit to Nantes. Ousmane Dembélé, Désiré Doué, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes, Marquinhos and Willian Pacho were all on the bench.They huffed and puffed but finally got over the line thanks to a fortuitously deflected Vitinha effort. Even physically diminished, Luis Enrique’s side find a way in Ligue 1. With their attention on more tantalising trophies, rotation will be the norm for PSG unless pressure can be applied by their rivals, and there are doubts there.Marseille, having finished second last season, and having strengthened with the likes of Angel Gomes, Facundo Medina and Igor Paixão – the most expensive summer signing by any French club bar PSG this summer – are the most likely to contest the champions’ supremacy. But they, too, struck some familiar chords in their opener.Roberto De Zerbi’s side dominated possession but did little with it despite Rennes going down to 10 men on the half-hour mark. Marseille had their first shot on target in the 66th minute and their lack of cutting edge came back to bite them in stoppage time. Ludovic Blas, off the bench, beat Marseille’s high line and slotted past Gerónimo Rulli one-on-one. “We should never be in a position to concede a goal like that,” said De Zerbi, who, according to reports in the local press, saved his harsher words for the dressing down, one of the rare moments occluded from mass viewership.View image in fullscreenRennes players celebrate as the inquest begins for Marseille.Photograph: Jean Catuffe/Getty ImagesWith tensions reportedly arising between Adrien Rabiot and the England Under-21 international Jonathan Rowe in the Marseille dressing room, De Zerbi intervened. “The others beat us on the pitch, and we come in here and fight among ourselves. You know what that means? That we have small balls. In Marseille, we need to have big ones. This is the last time this will happen,” the Italian could be heard saying in a speech that pierced through the walls of Roazhon Park.The tendency to explode is ingrained at Marseille, even embraced. A few years ago the club named their magma-influenced third kit “volcanic population” – a reference to the hostile atmosphere at the club’s stadium, the Stade Vélodrome. However, these internal eruptions are inconducive to the stability and consistency needed to sustain a real title challenge.Threats to quit, week-long retreats in Rome and reported tensions within the squad defined De Zerbi’s tumultuous if ultimately successful first season at Marseille. But there are degrees of success, and the contrast to the unity and serenity that characterised PSG’s fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title only goes to highlight what Marseille lack in this regard. Juggling European football won’t help their efforts to dethrone PSG either, not that the objective has been set to do so.Neymar left tearful after 6-0 loss that leads to sacking of Santos coachRead moreBeyond Marseille, there is Monaco, whose unconvincing 3-1 win againstLe Havrewas one of only two games that produced more than a single goal. “We cannot be satisfied with the performance. We can do much better,” said Adi Hütter. His team looks competitive once again but the potential departure of the captain, Denis Zakaria, a target for Al-Ahli, would represent a big blow to their ambitions.Lille look weaker, as evidenced in their 3-3 draw against Brest, while Nice look to be in a spot of bother. They lost 1-0 to Toulouse and were also dumped out of Champions League qualifying after a 4-0 loss to Benfica. Franck Haise has complained that his squad is not good enough for the dual tasks of competing in the Europa League this season while also trying to finish in the European places. That much was obvious at the weekend.Once the novelty of the innovations and unprecedented access available on Ligue 1+ wears off – and it will – the need for fresh storylines will become apparent. Few were provided on the opening weekend.Quick GuideLigue 1 resultsShowBrest 3-3 LilleAngers 1-0 Paris FCAuxerre 1-0 LorientMetz 0-1 StrasbourgNantes 0-1 PSGLens 0-1 LyonMonaco 3-1 Le HavreNice 0-1 ToulouseRennes 1-0 MarseilleWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsParis FCarrive in Ligue 1 with lofty ambitions, but they were brought quickly crashing back down to earth in their opener. Esteban Lepaul, the major reason Angers defied the odds to remain in the top flight last season, scored the only goal within the opening 10 minutes. Not even a red card for Angers’ Louis Mouton offered Paris FCa route back in on what was, by the manager Stéphane Gilli’s own admission, a “timid” return to the top flight.Unlike fellow promoted sides, Lorient and Metz, who also suffered narrow losses on the opening day, Paris FC will be able to turn to the transfer market to remedy the issues laid bare. Gilli has said there will be more arrivals, including Willem Geubbels, who was touted as the next big thing when he came through at Lyon. Now 24, he has joined from St Gallen and should improve a forward line that clearly lacks a bit of bite.Strasbourgenjoyed a winning start, beating local rivals Metz 1-0. They did so by becoming the first team in Europe’s top five leagues to field a starting XI of players born in 2000 or later. The extremities of BlueCo’s youth-centric recruitment strategy are being tested once again this summer. The club’sultras have protested against the club’s “absurd” transfer dealings. Continued on-pitch success, however, continues to dampen the voices of discontent around the Meinau.This is an article byGet French Football NewsExplore more on these topicsLigue 1Guardian Sport NetworkEuropean club footballParis Saint-GermainMarseilleMonacoLe HavreLillefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was truly grateful and surprised about how much people wanted to sponsor me because I have never done something like this before.”Foaese said fundraising came into her mind as soon as she heard of her selection for the World Cup. “Our team had spoken about what everyone was going to do to help support ourselves individually.“I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it, but [someone said] you might need help living-wise and to make sure the kids were sorted while I was away.”View image in fullscreenSamoa’s Nina Foaese sought funds to cover her expenses at home while she is at the Women’s World Cup.Photograph: Johan Rynners/World Rugby/Getty ImagesThe financial reality among the other teams is a mixed picture. The four home nations all have contracts in place. England’s 32 deals range from £39,000 to £48,000 and players receive £1,500 per game. Wales pay £23,000 to £30,000 for 37 players and Scotland £18,000 to £27,000. Ireland have 37 contracts in the region of £15,000 to £30,000.New Zealand, the defending champions, have 45 full‑time contracts, which vary from NZ$50,000 to NZ$70,000 (approximately £21,900-£30,600). The Black Ferns players also receive NZ $2,000 per week in assembly fees during tournaments and other benefits such as life and trauma insurance.Canada, who are among the favourites, do not have fixed contracts, but pay their players per tournament and have equal pay with the men’s team. A Canadian competing in all competitions this year would expect to receive CAN$12,000 (£6,400).Australia have 46 contracts, which range from A$15,000 to $70,000 (£7,200-£33,600) and players are paid per day in camp so that, if they are selected for all squads, they can boost their earnings by A$15,000.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Overall, the visitors were ineffective, managing only nine shots to United’s 22. United also dominated possession, with a 61.9% share.New season, same strife between the sticks for Manchester United | Jonathan WilsonRead more“It was not a great performance,” Saka said. “We were not up to our usual standards, the basics, sloppy giveaways. Our decision-making was not great and that cost us and gave United a lot of momentum. We did not get punished for it, but we can not do it every game.”Viktor Gyökeres had a muted Premier League debut afterhis £65m arrival from Sporting last monthand was replaced after 60 minutes.

United would countenance a temporary deal for the 22-year-old, though there is no suggestion that he is being forced out of the club. United are, however, open to his departure due to the options Ruben Amorim now has in attack.Tottenham close in on signing Crystal Palace attacker Eberechi EzeRead moreAmorim left Højlund out of the matchday squad forSunday’s 1-0 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford, with Matheus Cunha,signed from Wolvesin June, deployed instead as the hosts’ centre-forward. Benjamin Sesko, who came on as a substitute, is expected to be Amorim’s first-choice in the position following his recentarrival from RB Leipzig.Højlund is also of interest to Milan. “We are evaluating him these days, but the transfer market is unpredictable,” the club’s sporting director, Igli Tare, told Sport Mediaset. “We know that we have to intervene in that position and we also know that they must be players who can give something more to this group.”Bournemouthhave completed the signing of Ben Doak from Liverpool in a deal worth £25m. The 19-year-old attracted interest fromNottingham Forestand Leeds while Porto made a bid for the winger. But the Scotland international opted to join Andoni Iraola’s side and has completed the move following a medical.Liverpool negotiated a buy-back option in the transfer as they consider Doak has the potential to develop into a top attacking talent. The Anfield club did the same with Jarell Quansah’s£35m move to Bayer Leverkusen.View image in fullscreenBen Doak of Scotland runs with the ball while playing for Scotland against Croatia.Photograph: Ian MacNicol/UEFA/Getty ImagesDoak will make Liverpool a huge profit on the £600,000 they paid in training compensation to sign the teenager from Celtic in 2022. He made three Premier League substitute appearances for the club in total but impressed on loan at Middlesbrough last season before suffering a thigh injury. The departure of Doak means the Premier League champions have made £227m in player sales this summer, including add-ons. Liverpool remain keen to sign Alexander Isak from Newcastle and Marc Guéhi from Crystal Palace before the transfer deadline on 1 September.”Nottingham Foresthave completed the signing of the striker Arnaud Kalimuendo from Rennes for a fee of about £26m. Kalimuendo, who scored 17 goals in Ligue 1 last season, is the latest Forest addition after the arrivals ofOmari Hutchinson and James McAtee, signed for £37m and £30m from Ipswich and Manchester City respectively at the weekend. Forest are also expected to sign Douglas Luiz, who is keen on a return to the Premier League from Juventus.The 23-year-old Kalimuendo, who started his career at Paris Saint-Germain, will provide Forest with welcome attacking depth. Igor Jesus, one of seven summer signings and one of two players to join from Botafogo, will provide competition for Chris Wood, who scored twice in thevictory over Brentfordon Sunday, and Taiwo Awoniyi.Forest explored a deal for Rico Lewis but the 20-year-old England defender has suggestedhe wants to staywith City. Pep Guardiola expects Lewis to remain at the club. “I’ve never ever seen myself leaving,” Lewis said after starting City’s4-0 victory at Wolveson Saturday. “I’ve always wanted to play for City. It’s my dream. When I’m playing with the kind of players that I’m playing with, it brings out the best of me. I’m so happy.”TheAston Villawinger Leon Bailey is poised to join Roma on loan in a move that could become permanent. The Serie A club will pay about £2.5m for the season and have agreed a £19m option to purchase the Jamaica international. Bailey was used sparingly by Unai Emery last season and is one of several players Villa are keen to offload to generate financial headroom. Leander Dendoncker, who is close to joining Real Oviedo, and Àlex Moreno are among those surplus to requirements. Samuel Iling-Junior and Lewis Dobbin are wanted on loan by Championship clubs.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowManchester UnitedNottingham ForestManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

Venus Williams, at the age of 45, and compatriot Reilly Opelka face Karolina Muchova and Andrey Rublev .Meanwhile, the six-time Wimbledon doubles champion Gordon Reid says wheelchair tennis must keep proving its value to tournaments to help close the gap in prize money. Reid and his partner, Alfie Hewett, are preparing for the US Open, which last week announced a large increase in winnings.Quick GuideEdmund announces retirementShowThe former British No 1 Kyle Edmund has announced his retirement from tennis at the age of 30.Edmund won two ATP titles and became only the second British man after Sir Andy Murray to reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2018. He was part of the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years, and also represented his country at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.Unfortunately, Edmund’s ascent into the world’s top 50 corresponded with a knee injury that required three operations and kept him off the tour for almost two years.In a statement issued by the Lawn Tennis Association, Edmund said: “The last five years have taken a toll with three surgeries and other injuries [and] my body is telling me it’s finally reached the end point. Looking back I can say I tried my absolute best in my career and my hardest to get back to where I was. There are no regrets whatsoever.”Edmund, who defeated Novak Djokovic at the ATP Masters in 2018, made progress in his latest comeback attempt but decided the Nottingham Challenger final defeat against Jack Pinnington Jones last month would be his last match.He said on social media: “Of course to beat Novak, probably the greatest player of all time, was a great feeling and probably the biggest scalp of my career. I spent four or five years trying to come back and was never fully able to reach my goal. But over the next few weeks and months it will be a nice time to reflect and spend more time with my family and appreciate the journey.”PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.While the mixed doubles champions will now get $1m, the total pot for all wheelchair players is $1.69m. Reid and Hewett, who have won six titles at Flushing Meadows, with Hewett also winning four singles titles, have been a big driving force in the improvement in wheelchair tennis.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A year later he was immortalised in theOscar-winning film The Imitation Gameandin 2021 he became the face of the £50 note.A cornerstone of that legacy is in trouble, however. This month a group of stafffiled a whistleblower complaint with the Charity Commission, which has a regulatory role over ATI because the nominally independent organisation is a registered charity – albeit largely funded by the UK government.The complaint raised eight points of concern including the possibility that £100m of government funding might be withdrawn, which “could lead to the Institute’s collapse”.View image in fullscreenBank of England £50 banknote celebrating Alan Turing.Photograph: Bank Of England/Reuters“These concerns are so significant that many staff now believe the institute’s charitable status and public credibility are at risk,” said the complaint, which also raised concerns about internal governance and culture as well as oversight of spending.It is the latest in a series of staff broadsides at management. In March last year more than 180 staffwrote a letter to leadershipexpressing “serious concerns” about the organisation’s approach to diversity after it appointed four men to senior roles. In Decembermore than 90 staff warned in another letterthat ATI’s credibility was in “serious jeopardy” amid a restructuring that was threatening jobs – and research projects.ATI has recently notified about 50 staff – or approximately 10% of its workforce – that they are at risk of redundancy and is shutting down projects related to online safety, tackling the housing crisis and reducing health inequality.This is part of an overhaul dubbed Turing 2.0 under which the institute will focus on three key areas: health, the environment, and defence and security.A recent letter from the UK technology secretary,Peter Kyle, has made clear the overhaul does not go far enough. Writing to ATI’s chair last month, Kyle demanded the institute switch its main focus to defence and security, adding that ATI’s “longer-term funding arrangement” could be reviewed next year.“Moving forward, defence and national security projects should form a core of ATI’s activities, and relationships with the UK’s security, defence, and intelligence communities should be strengthened accordingly,” Kyle wrote.He also indicated that leadership changes might be needed.View image in fullscreenPeter Kyle, the technology secretary, has demanded the institute switch its main focus to defence and security.Photograph: Thomas Krych/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock“To realise this vision, it is imperative that the ATI’s leadership reflects the institute’s reformed focus,” he wrote. “Careful consideration should be given to the importance of an executive team who possesses a relevant background and sector knowledge to lead this transition.”It is against this backdrop – long-running staff dissatisfaction with leadership, a strategic and financial overhaul, and then a bombshell from the government – that the whistleblower complaint was filed.ATI is led by chief executive Jean Innes, who has had senior roles in the civil service and tech sector, and is chaired by Doug Gurr, the former head of Amazon’s UK operations andinterim chair of the UK’s competition watchdog.Gurr responded to Kyle last month with a letter pledging to “step up” on defence and national security as well as boosting the UK’s self-sufficiency in AI – or “sovereign capabilities”.“We will step up at a time of national need,” Gurr wrote.However, Gurr added that ATI will “continue to drive forward high-impact work in environment and healthcare” where it fits with the “government’s missions and the interests of our philanthropic and private funders”.At a recent meeting between staff and ATI leadership, held remotely, Gurr faced pointed questions about the new direction raised by Kyle and the institute’s restructuring. One attender said the atmosphere was difficult, describing the mood among the more than 100 employees during the meeting as “contemptuous throughout”.In an internal note to staff this week, Innes and Gurr confirmed a new working group of government officials and ATI staff had met to discuss the new direction. It also confirmed people would be leaving through redundancies and non-renewal of contracts.ATI’s goals include to “advance world-class research and apply it to national and global challenges”, as well as driving an “informed public conversation” on AI. Its five founding UK universities were Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh, UCL and Warwick, with its research work including teaming up with the Met Office toimprove weather forecasting, creatingcardiac “digital twins”to study heart disease andimproving air traffic control.View image in fullscreenDoug Gurr, chair of ATI, was said to have faced pointed questions about the institute’s new direction from staff in a ‘contemptuous’ mood.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianA source who worked in the previous Conservative government said Labour’s concerns about the institute are “far from new” and there had been disquiet in political circles about the institute’s performance for some time, with multiple university stakeholders blurring its focus.In that context, the source said, it makes sense to double down on what the institute does well – defence and security – or “just shut it down and start again”.Prof Jon Crowcroft, the Marconi professor of communication systems at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Lab, and an adviser to Innes, says the institute’s staff have become unsettled.“I think the crisis in terms of people is real. A lot of people are still there because they believe it’s a good, open institution doing valuable public work. But they’re also wondering where their job is going to be,” he says.He adds: “I have not seen a plan A for keeping all the staff happy, which would mean keeping some non-defence and security projects. The reason why staff have issued these letters is because they have not seen that.”Referring to ATI’s base at the British Library in London, he says: “Nor have I seen a plan B for what happens if too many people leave, because so many projects have gone, which means the core funding is not viable and they cannot justify the size of the building they are in.”There are “mixed views” on the looming shift to defence and security, according to a current staff member who says they have listened to a “diverse” array of concerns among colleagues.“We understand the national importance issue. Very few of us are saying that work shouldn’t happen. But we think a singular focus would be too narrow. Turing’s strength comes from applying AI to a wide range of societal challenges, from health to the environment, with responsible innovation at the heart.”View image in fullscreenThe British Library where ATI is based.Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty ImagesThe staff member adds: “Those areas are still important, and with the right leadership we could fulfil the vision and purpose that brought us here in the first place.”The staff member adds that Gurr’s letter pledging to double down on defence and security, while still working on health and environment, leaves ATI in a “precarious standoff” with government.“The leadership is hoping the government’s attention, or its personnel, shifts,” they said. Hall says the institute has no choice but to change.“Clearly there is not much money around and the institute needs to do what the government asks. If it doesn’t, then presumably the government will close it down.”She adds: “The institute has ceased to be what it was initially set up to be, which was a national institute for data science and AI. The government has asked it to focus on defence and security. Whether the UK needs such an institute is for the government to decide. Personally I would like to see the justification.”Crowcroft, who defends the quality of the institute’s work, says the UK has always been strong in AI and is “probably now stronger still”, pointing to multiple generations of AI expertise produced by universities such as Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College and Edinburgh as well as the success of London-based Google DeepMind and the establishment of UK-based AI units by leading US tech firms such as Microsoft and OpenAI.A spokesperson for ATI said the institute was going through “substantial” change to continue to deliver in its unique role as the UK’s national institute for data science and AI.“As we move forward, we’re focused on delivering real-world impact across society’s biggest challenges, including responding to the national need to double down on our work in defence, national security and sovereign capabilities.”A government spokesperson said the technology secretary wants ATI to show value for money for taxpayer, which can be achieved by “giving the institute a key role in safeguarding our national security and positioning it where the British public expects it to be”.Turing’s legacy will live on. But in terms of the institute that bears his name, its longevity is in doubt.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Alan TuringComputingPeter KylenewsShareReuse this content"

Musk tweeted: “Torturing AI is not OK.”Anthropic’s announcement comes amid a debate over AI sentience. Critics of the booming AI industry, such as the linguist Emily Bender, say LLMs are simply “synthetic text-extruding machines” which force huge training datasets “through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it.”It is a position that has recently led some in the AI world to start calling chatbots “clankers”.But other experts, such as Robert Long, a researcher on AI consciousness,have saidbasic moral decency dictates that “if and when AIs develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and preferences rather than assuming we know best”.Some researchers, like Chad DeChant, at Columbia University,have advocated care should be takenbecause when AIs are designed with longer memories, stored information could be used in ways which lead to unpredictable and potentially undesirable behaviour.Others have argued that curbing sadistic abuse of AIs matters to safeguard against human degeneracy rather than to limit any suffering of an AI.Anthropic’s decision comes after ittested Claude Opus 4 to see how it responded to task requestsvaried by difficulty, topic, type of task and the expected impact (positive, negative or neutral). When it was given the opportunity to respond by doing nothing or ending the chat, its strongest preference was against carrying out harmful tasks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he cautioned that it remained unclear what, if any, moral thought exists behind the character that AIs play when they are responding to a user based on the vast training data they have been fed and the ethical guidelines they have been instructed to follow.He said Anthropic’s decision also risked deluding some users that the character they are interacting with is real, when “what remains really unclear is what lies behind the characters”. There have been several reports of people harming themselves based on suggestions made by chatbots, includingclaims that a teenager killed himselfafter being manipulated by a chatbot.Birch previously warned of “social ruptures” in societybetween people who believe AIs are sentient and those who treat them like machines.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingShareReuse this content"

Does its author think the technology could write a better novel than a human?Mon 18 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 10.04 EDTShare“Idon’t feel particularly unhappy about my work being used to train AI,” says Japanese novelist Rie Qudan. “Even if it is copied, I feel confident there’s a part of me that will remain, which nobody can copy.”The 34-year old author is talking to me via Zoom from her home near Tokyo, ahead of the publication of the English-language translation of her fourth novel, Sympathy Tower Tokyo.The book attracted controversy in Japan when it won a prestigious prize, despite being partly written by ChatGPT.The author speaks conversational English, but her translator, Jesse Kirkwood, is also on the line, interpreting questions and answers when needed. At the heart of Sympathy Tower Tokyo is a Japanese architect, Sara Machina, who has been commissioned to build a new tower to house convicted criminals. It will be a representation of what one character – not without irony – calls “the extraordinary broadmindedness of the Japanese people”, in that the tower will house offenders in compassionate comfort.In the novel, Sara, herself a victim of violent crime, wonders if this sympathetic approach to criminals is appropriate. Does this sympathy reflect Japanese society in reality?“It’s definitely prevalent,” says Qudan. One of the triggers for writing the novel, she adds, was theassassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abein July 2022. “The person who shot him became the centre of a lot of attention in Japan – and his background elicited a lot of sympathy from people. He had grown up in a heavily religious household, and been deprived of freedom. That idea had been in my head for a long time, and when I came to write the novel, it came out again as part of the process.”The question of public attitudes towards criminals runs through the story, in serious and satirical ways. Potential residents of the tower must take a “Sympathy Test” to determine if they are deserving of compassion (“Have your parents ever acted violently towards you? – Yes / No / Don’t know”) … and the ultimate decision will be made by AI.Changes of language over the last few decades are affecting how people act or view thingsSympathy Tower Tokyo won the Akutagawa prize in 2024 for new or rising authors when it was first published. She was “delighted”, she says, but also “liberated, because once you make your debut as a writer, there’s a constant pressure to win this prize”. In 2022, she had been nominated for her book Schoolgirl, but didn’t win. “I felt I’d let people down by not winning the prize, and that was something I didn’t want to repeat. You know, with that prize it stays with you your whole life.”But the book also grabbed attention because Qudan said that part of it – 5% was the figure given, though she now says that was only an approximation – was written using artificial intelligence. This, she tells me, comprised parts of the novel which are presented as a character’s exchange with ChatGPT. But Qudan also “gained a lot of inspiration” for the novel through “exchanges with AI and from the realisation that it can reflect human thought processes in interesting ways”. Qudan’s use of AI, in other words, seeks not to deceive the reader but to help us to see its effects.One character feels pity for the chatbot, “condemned to an empty life of endlessly spewing out the language it was told to spew, without ever understanding what this cut-and-paste patchwork of other people’s words meant”.Does Qudan fear that AI will supplant human writers? “Maybe a future will come when that happens, but right now there’s no way an AI can write a novel that’s better than a human author.” Among Japanese readers, Sympathy Tower Tokyo “did get attention for using AI. But more than that, it was a focus on the language itself which really generated discussion; how the changes of language over the last few decades are affecting how people act or view things.”And this feeds into the key issue at the heart of Qudan’s book. Sympathy Tower Tokyo is really all about language, which in the book is not just how we express ourselves, but how we reveal ourselves. “Words determine our reality,” says one character.By using katakana, a lot of negative associations can be replaced by neutral one. It doesn’t trigger people in the same wayIn the novel, a key debate is around the growth of katakana in Japan – that is, the script used to write foreign-derived words. Words rendered in katakana (as opposed to hiragana script and kanji characters, which are used to write traditional Japanese words) resemble transliterations of English – “negurekuto” for neglect, “fōrin wākāzu” for foreign workers – and to Japanese ears they are “milder, more euphemistic” than traditional kanji words, and can avoid “discriminatory turns of phrase”. The character Sara thinks “Japanese people are trying to abandon their own language”. Her boyfriend wants to “stop this wretched proliferation of katakana”.But stopping it is not easy, and probably not possible. Qudan explains that while older generations sometimes choose katakana over kanji, or vice versa, for younger generations like her – Qudan was born in 1990 – katakana “has become a standard which is not questioned”.This is not merely an academic or cultural detail, but an urgent issue for Japan’s politics today. In Japanese elections last month, the far-right party Sanseitosurged in support, winning 14 seats in the upper house of parliament, where it had previously held only one. The party campaigns on a slogan that translates as “Japanese people first”, echoing Donald Trump and Maga’s “America first”. Its success has raised fears of an anti-foreigner backlash. Is diversity valued in Japan?“Unfortunately,” Qudan says, “the reality is that not all Japanese people welcome diversity. Twelve years ago, I had a foreign, non-Japanese boyfriend, and I introduced him to my parents. My mother was extremely unhappy. She panicked. It might have been the biggest shock in my entire life to see my own mother react in this way. I’d never thought of her as someone who discriminated against foreigners.‘Marriage feels like a hostage situation, and motherhood a curse’: Japanese author Sayaka MurataRead more“There are people all around you who you would never think hold those views, who actually do hold those views. A lot of Japanese people, on the surface, they know how to act in a way that makes them seem [welcoming of diversity]. And this discrepancy between what people think on the inside and what they say is a very distinctive feature.”This brings us back to language, and how it can both conceal and reveal. In its “Japanese people first” slogan, Qudan explains, the Sanseito party uses the katakana word for “first”, rather than the traditional Japanese kanji word. “By using the katakana equivalent,” Qudan says, “a lot of the negative associations can be replaced by neutral ones. It doesn’t trigger people in the same way.”It creates, in other words, a sort of plausible deniability? “Yes, yes. They know exactly what they’re doing. And that’s why this use of katakana requires our attention,” Qudan concludes. “When someone uses katakana, we should ask: what are they trying to hide?”Sympathy Tower Tokyo by Rie Qudan is published on 21 August (Penguin Books, £10.99).

It’s $1,300 on trash’: the adults addicted to blind box toys like LabubusGrownups get thrills from opening these collectibles they buy without knowing what they’re getting – but experts warn the craze is akin to gamblingAmelia TaitMon 18 Aug 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 11.59 EDTShareJess has never touched a slot machine, played the lottery or bought a scratch-off, but she fears she may have a gambling problem nonetheless.This July, the 28-year-old found herself spending up to $270 a week on blind boxes – that is, surprise items that are sold in sealed, opaque packaging. Activewear companies, bookshops and even candy stores all sell mystery bundles of their products, but the brands currently dominating the market produce collectible toys with cute but unusual names. If you want a complete collection of Labubu, Smiski, Dimoo, Pucky, Skullpanda or Sonny Angel figurines, then you will have to buy blind box after blind box, sighing at every duplicate and praying the next package contains the creature you need to finish the set.“It’s silly but it is very addictive,” says Jess, who is based in Ireland but prefers not to reveal her full name or occupation. Jess started buying Labubu dolls in April after seeing them on TikTok: these strange, toothsome and fuzzy monsters have exploded in popularity this year thanks to celebrity endorsements and social media hype. Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind Labubus and many other mystery collectibles, is now estimated to be worth $40bn – but in June, the company’s stock briefly plunged after a Chinesestate media publicationcondemned blind box marketing as predatory.The buyer’s guilt that I get nearly every time after I’ve spent is insane … Sometimes I open things and I don’t want themJessJess believes she is addicted to blind boxes: after she tried banning herself from buying them in July, she “snapped” and suddenly found herself ordering 25 more. Sitting at home and waiting for parcels to arrive, she would itch to go out and physically get some more: “I would end up buying stuff that I didn’t care about just for the thrill of opening a box.” Jess found herself purchasing mystery plushies from the brand Squishmallows, which she doesn’t even like. “I’d open them and be like, ‘Why do I now have this squishy lobster?’”Jess says opening blind boxes feels like gambling because of the highs and lows: “Whenever you get the one that you want, it’s unreal.”On social media, it’s easy to see the impulse buying provoked by blind box marketing. In oneTikTok videowith 2.6m likes, a woman buys a $27.99 Skullpanda, looks at the list of possible toys inside the box and says she would “be happy with any of them” except the Christmas tree dolls. Low and behold, the box contains the Christmas tree, and – visibly frustrated – she rushes back to the store to buy a second box. Another $27.99 later, she becomes the less-than-proud owner of two Christmas trees.In adifferent video, a man buys six bags of mystery Disney pins at $44.99 each, but after ending up with 17 duplicates and an incomplete set, goes back to buy two more, bringing his total spend to almost $360.And some buyers don’t just seek the toys they personally like – they also hunt for the “rare” or “secret” items that are more uncommon and thus more valuable.View image in fullscreenLabubu figurines sit on a shelf at the Labu’Tique Shop in Anaheim, California, in June.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Orange County Register/Getty Images“The buyer’s guilt that I get nearly every time after I’ve spent is insane,” Jess says, adding that she could have used the money for her forthcoming wedding. “If it were to continue like this, it would become dire, because who can pop off £1,000 [$1,300] in a couple of months on literal shit?” Jess says she feels “debilitated” by her habit. “Sometimes I open things and I don’t want them.”Dana Nguyen is a 27-year-old from Monterey, California, who has spent $4,000 on Labubu dolls since the start of this year (on the Pop Mart website, Labubu dolls and figurines range in price from $19.99 to $959.50 each). This April, Nguyen realised she had a problem when she went to her PO Box and saw 20 parcels waiting for her. “I’m telling myself I want to fly to Europe, I want to travel the world, but how can I do that if I’m spending $4,000 on fur, cotton, vinyl, whatever these things are made of?”When asked to describe the feeling she gets when opening blind boxes, she says: “Honestly, that’s gambling. I’m gonna say it flat out: it’s straight gambling.“I always tell myself I won’t be one of those people in Vegas gambling on the slot machines or on the tables – and then I’m over here doing the exact same thing.”Adults in America are buying more toys than ever before. In the first half of 2025, the number of toys bought for grownupsincreased 18%– and in 2024, adults bought more toys for themselvesthan for preschoolersfor the very first time. Enthusiasts offer easy explanations for their “kidulting”, summarised neatly in oneBBC headline: “Adults buying kids’ toys to escape global turmoil.” As Nguyen puts it: “You’re already struggling as it is, with the economy, with society, and you think: OK, let me just have a little sweet treat because I’m not able to afford other luxuries in life.”Meanwhile, collecting is a very compelling habit. Cary Lee is an Australia-based marketing specialist who researches consumer behaviour. Leehas foundsix main reasons that people collect, including a sense of achievement, an extension of selfhood, community membership and a desire for a legacy. Lee’s studies have shown that the financial motivation to build a collection (for instance, the idea it might be worth something one day) is relatively weak compared with these intrinsic, emotional incentives. “We have an innate part of us which wants to acquire items to make a collection,” he says.Toy companies, of course, are well aware of this. In a 2020prospectus for potential investors, Pop Mart wrote: “While traditional toys are primarily for children to play with, pop toys target young adults between 15 years old and 40 years old in general, who seek for emotional value from expressing personality and attitude.” The company declared itself “relentless” in its desire to “attract and build a fast-growing, young and passionate fanbase” and argued that blind boxes in particular inspire repeat purchases “due to unpredictability and fun”.It’s a perfect selling point for people like me who are struggling with their mental health, to just have that little sweet treatDana NguyenIn 2019, Pop Mart asked market research company Frost & Sullivan to survey more than 1,000 consumers and found that, “around 70% of pop toy consumers would purchase blind box toys three times or more for a specific toy design they want”.Lee hasconductedstudieson blind boxes and has found that most US consumers often come across their first blind box in stores and buy them impulsively. Yet regardless of the outcome – whether they get the toy they like the look of or a dud – people are often compelled to go back and buy another box. One of Lee’s papers uncovered “an addictive loop of impulsive purchases”, arguing there was “a ‘dark side’ to a seemingly innocuous product”.Online, an oft-repeated defence for the hyperconsumption of collectible toys is: “It makes me happy. It’s not harming anyone” – but is that really true? Beyond the environmental impact – not only are the toys themselves plastic, the packaging is often elaborate and multilayered to add to the thrill of unboxing – there is also personal wellbeing to consider. Nguyen says she initially hid the scale of her spending from her husband (whose business she helps run), and her mental health suffered at the peak of her blind box addiction.“I have bipolar and I have very manic episodes where I’m willing to take more risks than I normally would,” she says. After high-energy episodes, sometimes she finds herself irritable and in a low mood. “You just want a little quick fix. It’s a perfect selling point for people like me who are struggling with their mental health, to just have that little sweet treat, to have that little bit of serotonin or dopamine in their systems.”View image in fullscreenShoppers choose from 10 tons of mystery packs during a blind sale at Merlata Bloom shopping mall in February in Milan, Italy.Photograph: Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty ImagesNow that she has restricted herself to purchasing fewer blind boxes, Nguyen says: “I feel like my nervous system has calmed a lot more.”Eddie is a 34-year-old cashier from Mississippi who recently spent about $400 on blind boxes in a single month. “It made me feel sick to my stomach because I didn’t feel like I was in control of what I was spending,” he says. “I’d immediately have buyer’s remorse after making a purchase, and sometimes, I wasn’t even excited to get the package. I was more worried about the damage I’d done to my savings and finances.”A burgeoning field of study into these gambling-like mechanisms and their impact has researchers concerned. Leon Xiao is an assistant professor at the City University of Hong Kong who researches video game law and the challenges of regulating gambling-like products. Xiao’s work has historically focused on “loot boxes”, which are digital blind boxes sold for real money inside video games. (The items inside often help players perform better in the game.) Yet Xiao is intrigued by the increased “gamblification” of physical merchandise. “I’ve seen T-shirts being sold in blind boxes, chocolates in blind boxes,” he says.While Xiao pours cold water on one Chinese studypublished in 2022, which found that engaging with blind boxes was positively associated with suicide risk in young people – “that’s obviously going too far. There’s also a paper about drinking milk tea or boba linked to suicidal ideation” – he is troubled by other research findings. Onelongitudinal studypublished in 2023 found that young people who bought loot boxes participated in more gambling six months later than those who did not. One ofXiao’s own studieshas found a correlation between buying mystery card packs and experiencing gambling problems. And apaper published this Julyargued that loot box spending can be associated with psychological distress and an increased risk of “extreme distress”. Xiao says: “We are concerned about vulnerable people spending more money and experiencing harm.”Xiao wonders whether new consumer laws might be the answer. In China, a set ofadvisory guidelinesreleased in 2022 asked companies to publish probability disclosures, set age and spending limits, and even implement “pity mechanics” whereby customers are offered the item they desire after making a number of purchases. These guidelines also banned the sale of blind boxes to kids under age eight and required older children obtain parental permission before buying them – but in practice, enforcement is not so stringent.It became like a game … Most of the time I didn’t want the stuff, I just liked the excitement of waiting, finding and obtaining themBethanIn the US, the Federal Trade Commission haslooked intovideo game loot boxes and evenfined one developer$20m for unfairly marketing to children and misleading players about the odds, but the FTC declined to comment on blind boxes when contacted by the Guardian. In 2018, loot boxes weredeclared illegalunder existing gambling laws in Belgium, butXiao’s researchhas found that enforcement remains a problem there, too.Jesper Andersson is a 23-year-old from Sweden who realised in 2024 that he had spent more than $4,000 in just a few months on mystery packs in the video game Fifa. “I’ve gambled normally on football and stuff like that, but I get anxious if I even lose $10. But when I drop $100 on Fifa, I don’t even care,” he says. “It’s hard to explain why, it just feels very different.” Perhaps it feels different because Andersson’s Fifa pack habit started as a child – without his own disposable income, he asked for Fifa coins every Christmas for nine years.A number of children’s toys are now sold via a mystery mechanism: LOL Surprise! dolls, Mini Brands, and endless Disney figurines and plushies. It’s easy to see how youngsters are becoming acclimatised to this type of consumption, which could arguably normalise gambling.In June, Bethan found herself with no money left for gas thanks to her Labubu habit. The 55-year-old – who has just passed the California bar exam and asked to use a pseudonym – got hooked on the dolls in May. “It became like a game. Some of the time – most of the time – I didn’t want the stuff. I just liked the excitement of waiting, finding and obtaining them,” she says.Bethan has spent hundreds of dollars on Labubus (and knockoff “Lafufus”) in just a few months; while she has been able to pay her bills, she has had to borrow money for gas, has no money left for emergencies, and has increased her credit card debt. “There are things I didn’t normally have to save up for but now I have to,” she says.But Bethan is not just motivated by the blind box mechanism – in fact, she has numerous packages sitting unopened in her house. She is compelled by a sense of competition; Labubus can sell out quickly online, and Bethan prides herself on tracking down sellers to get her hands on new releases. “For me, it’s getting them before everybody else … at a low price before they go up,” she says.Labubu for life: how did a viral doll become a ‘social currency’? Just ask these diehard fansRead moreAs problematic as these compulsive behaviours can be, they could be exacerbated by new ways of shopping. Pop Mart runs a number of channels onTikTokwhere it drops new products in live streams, forcing consumers to scramble to add them to their carts. “I genuinely spent three weeks every day trying to get one Labubu,” Jess says, “I’ll never forget feeling how I felt when I got one.”Another app, Whatnot, hosts live stream auctions where people bid on collectibles and other products – it’s currently the 15th most popular free iPhone app. Eddie says Whatnot exacerbated his problem spending. “The hosts and the chat make these kind of shopping events more fun but also parasocial,” he says. “You see other people spending even more than you.” Eddie found it hard to keep track of his spending inside the app: “I never saw an overall total from a shop until my order arrived at my house.”Lee, the marketing expert, says “scarcity marketing” like this can be very psychologically compelling. He argues that time limits on drops and auctions can create a “fear of missing out”, compelling consumers to act impulsively.Defenders of blind boxes note that baseball cards have been around for over a century – and millennials bought mystery playing cards or stickers as kids. Yet, Lee says, what has changed now is the amount of money at stake and how easy it is to spend that money using digital platforms. While a pack of Pokémon cards might have cost a few dollars in the 1990s, most of the blind boxes offered on Pop Mart’s website range in price from $15-$26 – though the most expensive one currently available is nearly $300.View image in fullscreenBlind boxes of Labubu dolls at a Pop Mart store in Shenzhen, China, in June.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesBethan says she has “cut back” on blind boxes, but has not stopped. Andersson last spent money in Fifa a month before we spoke, while Eddie is now trying to stay away from blind boxes. Nguyen has managed to recoup her money by reselling her collection online during the peak of Labubu popularity, but she still has unpopular ones sitting around that she cannot sell.Jess faces similar problems – she has tried to sell some of the Labubu figurines she does not like online but has found no one else likes them either. “They’re definitely not in as high demand as they were at the start of this year.” Jess is now prepared to sell her toys for half of what she paid for them. Yet although she now has “quite a large collection of stuff and nowhere to put it”, she is still buying more blind boxes. Her ultimate aim is to cut down to one box a month.Most of the people I speak to would like to see greater regulation of blind boxes, although when I first bring up the idea, Jess admits: “My first reaction was: ‘No! Please don’t take these away from me.’” But she does believe blind boxes are akin to gambling, so suggests there should be “greater warnings about what you could be sucked into”.“I definitely convinced myself at the start that it wasn’t something that could could hurt me, because of the nature of collecting cute things,” she says. “But it’s very underhanded, how it can affect you without you realizing.”Explore more on these topicsToysShopping tripsTikTokfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means payment and swag – all she’s had is a free pen. “I really do it for myself,” she says, “and for the people who follow me”.Lerner, 64, has for 20yearsworked as a literary agent for writers including Patti Smith and Temple Grandin. She’s an author of nonfiction and now of a debut novel, Shred Sisters – “a love letter to loneliness”. But the “doing” she’s talking about is on TikTok,where she has amassed 1.5m likesfor videos in which she reads from the diaries she wrote in her turbulent 20s.“You don’t know who you’ll love, who will love you, what you will do for work, what is your purpose,” she says in one post. “This morning I found one line in my diary that just sums [your 20s] up: ‘I feel as if I don’t know who I am, today.’”Lerner posts in her dressing gown, without makeup. Initially she explored BookTok to support her authors. But with her own novel forthcoming, she started posting, camera off, and got no followers. “A friend told me, you need to be on camera and think of it as your own TV channel … I thought, ‘Well, maybe I will read from my old diaries.’”She’d kept one from the age of 11, after reading Anne Frank’s The Diary of a Young Girl. “I wrote my first poems in there. I vented. I tried to analyse myself …” Her journals from the ages of 12 to 18 were lost when her car was stolen, but those from her 20s – about 30 volumes – were stowed in a crawl space in her attic.“My diaries are very sad. They’re all about being lonely, looking for love, looking for friendship, trying to figure out who I was,” she says.Lerner describes herself as “a late bloomer”. She was accepted on to Columbia’s MFA poetry programme at 26, entering publishing in her late 20s when most editorial assistants were fresh from college. “I didn’t fall in love till I was 30. I’d never had any significant relationships … I lost a lot of my teenage years and most of my 20s struggling with depression.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s all about trying to connect and communicate’ … Betsy Lerner, photographed in New Haven, Connecticut.Photograph: Nicole Frappier/The GuardianWhen she was 15, her parents had taken her to a psychiatrist, and she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. “I didn’t want to accept that I had this illness. I fought it a lot,” she says. Her 2003 memoir,Food and Loathing, documents her relationship with her weight, food, depression and more, and at one point in her late 20s describes her straddling a ledge on a bridge above the Hudson River.The turning point came at 30. She found a psychopharmacologist – who “figured out” the right lithium dosage (they’ve worked together for 35 years) – and she got married.Her diaries stopped. She had written them alone in bed at night. But now, “I just didn’t feel that sad and lonely any more”, she says.For years, Lerner says, “I gravitated toward a lot of intensity.” Now, “I prioritise stability over everything.”She had never thought she’d write a novel. But in 2019she came through “four very tragic deaths”. She lost her mother, then her teenage niece and nephew,Ruby and Hart Campbell, who were killed by a drunk driver, and her best friend, the writer George Hodgman, whodied by suicide. “I still don’t know who I’m grieving for at any given time,” she says.In the aftermath of these deaths she started to write Shred Sisters, partly inspired by the online workouts – shredding – she and her two sisters did during Covid to take care of each other, and as “a way of working through all of that grief”. She is already writing another novel, and for as long as there is material in the diaries, and there is TikTok, she will continue to share them. “It’s all about trying to connect and communicate,” she says.“There’s a constant stream of comments from kids in their 20s who identify with my struggles. That’s really what keeps me going. I feel this connection to these kids … I try to say, I felt the same. Hang in. Some heart emojis.

I’d go with Starmer or RutteSimon McDonald was permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, 2015-2020, and is now a crossbench peerMon 18 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 12.17 EDTShareLast week’s extraordinary summit meeting in Alaska is being followed today by aneven more extraordinary international conferencein Washington. None of the participants knew they were going to take part two days ago. In recent decades, diplomacy has been increasingly conducted in ad hoc contact groups – but the group of seven countries (the US, Ukraine, the UK, Germany, Finland, Italy and France) and two international organisations (Nato and the EU) has never met in this way before.Officials will be preparing in the usual way, assembling briefing packs and writing talking points, aiming to please their bosses and, hopefully, allowing them to make the most effective intervention.They should take a deep breath and think differently. The precedents of European Councils and Nato summits – and evenDonald Trumpbilaterals – are misleading enough to be actively unhelpful. As former colleagues from Washington to Kyiv, via London, Paris, Brussels, Rome, Berlin and Helsinki, prep their principals, I urge them to discard the traditional approach.The usual format of each leader making a statement (however brief) just won’t cut it. There are three key groupings in the meeting – the US,Ukraineand Europe. Europe should have a single spokesperson. Most European participants might be prepared to concede to that approach, as long as their leader is the chosen one. But only two are really in the frame.The meeting will be conducted entirely in English with an interpreter forVolodymyr Zelenskyy. But there will be only two native English speakers, with Keir Starmer as the only European. Two others have spoken English for so long that they count as near-native speakers: Finland’s president, Alexander Stubb, and Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte. Stubb represents the smallest participant, often an advantage when corralling bigger beasts, while Rutte represents Europe’s military alliance. The others speak well enough for most meetings but Trump’s quirkiness could wrong-foot them. Emmanuel Macron, Ursula von der Leyen, Friedrich Merz and Giorgia Meloni speak well enough to make any point they want to make, but not necessarily in the best way to make it. Trump takes offence easily.So, Rutte or Starmer should speak forEurope. Whoever speaks needs to make their points without notes, look Trump in the eye, be prepared to be interrupted but disciplined enough not to lose the thread – and to resume their presentation when the president has subsided.1:55'There’s no deal until there’s a deal,' says Trump on Ukraine war after talks with Putin – videoThe European message needs to build onthe Alaska summit. European publics and pundits have declared Vladimir Putin the winner, and poured scorn on Trump’s kowtowing and conspicuous lack of success; some politicians have joined in. Britons might think their government craven for seeing the meeting as the start of a promising initiative, but that’s really the only sensible diplomatic take.The most promising result of the Anchorage summit was Trump’s conclusion that aiming for a ceasefire was not good enough; we need to move smartly to a full agreement. The Europeans could signal their willingness to play a full part in implementing such an agreement. That role, above everything else, will be providing concrete security guarantees. Putin is highly likely to reject that.But what if the comprehensive agreement also had something important for him? Putin’s two key territorial requirements are the land bridge to Crimea and the whole of Donbas. He has the first but not the second.Ukraine would hate giving up land thatRussiahas never conquered. But the aim here is peace, and peace always requires concessions. Ukraine has,of course, a great interest in ending the fighting. It wants to do that – with honour – and it wants no resumption.The precedent is the winter war of 1939-40. At the outset, Finland looked completely outgunned by the Soviet Union. But, like the Ukrainians, they fought bravely. Like the Ukrainians, they did much better than any outsider predicted. But in the end, they ceded more land than the Soviets were occupying in order to make peace – 11% of their territory, including Karelia (inspiration for their national composer’s most famous piece of music).In 1940, Finland had reason to fear that the Soviets would be back for more. Operation Barbarossa came to their rescue one year later, when the Soviet Union was the target of the biggest land invasion in history. In 2025, Ukraine needs something more immediate.

I am firmly in the latter group.I adore Book Week. I really do. The parade, the noise, the delight on small faces as they become Gruffalos, Matildas and, almost always, Wally (he’s going to be impossible not to find). And even better, the smiling grandparents and parents, and the teachers who always impress in their elaborate costumes and matching enthusiasm.But every August, this celebration of reading collides head-on with my complete lack of crafting skills. I can plot a novel, sure. Sew a dragon tail? Not so much.My kids have done the Book Week walk of shame many times. This year will be different | Melanie La’BrooyRead moreMy approach is pure survival parenting. A Hogwarts robe from Christmas repurposed for the third year in a row? Done. AWimpy Kidmask drawn in five minutes with a black texta and stapled to some string? Absolutely. My kids have learned their mother’s talents lie in storytelling and finding things in the back of the cupboard, not in sewing sequins until midnight.The reality is the Book Week mental load falls mostly on mothers, stacked on top of everything else: school lunches, work deadlines, permission slips, the sudden demand for cupcakes “by tomorrow”. It’s one more task in the long invisible list.The thing is – and I’ve had to remind myself of this more than once – no one really cares how well or not your child is dressed. In this case at least, parents need to give themselves an A for effort. If you tried, you succeeded.Last year I sent my son dressed as a comic book character (OK fine, a gaming character whose name rhymes with Dario) because he wore the same costume the Halloween before. Beside him his best friend was dressed, I assume, as a rock star – wearing a bad wig and a T-shirt with jeans. Neither of them seemed to care that they weren’t technically “Book Week” characters, because they were swept up in the magic of the spectacle.We’re not here to celebrate how good you are at crafting a costume and whether it meets stringent Book Week standards, I say to myself. We’re here to celebrate reading.There’s a decline in reading for pleasure among kids as they get older.A survey by the Australian Bureau of Statisticsfound not only are children reading less across the board since 2017-2018, but while 76% of children aged between five and eight read for pleasure, just 63% of those aged 12 to 14 did. Reading rates continue to drop as teens get older,with almost 30% of teens in years 7 to 12not reading in their spare time.And we need more kids to read. I’m saying this not just as an author and a parent, but because research shows us kids who read do better from asocial and economic perspective.The Book Week parade is a reminder of the importance of books and reading. Kids step into a character and for a day inhabit someone else’s life. They get to try on bravery, mischief, kindness. And as parents, whether we craft for months or wing it the night before, we get to stand in the crowd and watch them claim that space.But more importantly, when kids and parents go home, I hope the magic of books and reading continues, because having parents who readstrongly determineswhether their kids will read too. In a world where attention spans are shrinking and literacy rates are falling, reading is perhaps more important for kids than ever before.‘It feels an almost holy moment’: the beauty and magic of reading aloud to childrenRead moreThis year is the 80th anniversary of Children’s Book Week in Australia. I think this means it’s not going anywhere any time soon.I hope the joy of reading and books continues to be celebrated well into the future, so my own children are grappling with what to dress their kids for the parade – because despite my lack of crafting skills I do enjoy this joyous, raucous event. I know, watching my older kids grow up, that the costumes will be discarded and forgotten, but the memory, and the story, will live on.Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have urgent business with the dress-up box.Saman Shad is an author of two books and a mum of three kids.

Peter Hain was Labour MP for Neath and now sits in the House of LordsMon 18 Aug 2025 09.30 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareIs terrorism really a vicar with a peaceful placard?As parliamentarians who are passionate about democracy and civil liberties, we know that both are under threat. A growing number of organisations encourage violence and intimidation in pursuit of political aims. MPs are besieged with threats, advised not to hold in-person surgeries and are grieving still fortwo colleagues killedin the past 10 years. Anti-migrant protests and threats are encouraged by the far right to take place across the country. Yet attempts to address all this are increasingly destabilising public confidence in politics, emboldening those who fan the flames of hatred by claiming a “two-tier” response. Without change, the danger that someone will get hurt – or killed again – will only grow.Driven by both homegrown and overseas extremism, and social media algorithms, there is a growing trend for direct action to end in physical harm or destruction in order to get noticed. Proscription is the primary tool open to governments to put a hard stop to this, but withnearly 100 organisationsand hundreds more Britons now labelled “terrorists” in recent weeks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain parity between the organisations proscribed within the public mind. For any law to be effective, it has to be workable and legitimate. For it to defend democracy, it must also not be designed – or be seen to be designed – to spare ministers the difficulties of dealing with dissent. Proscription puts the person peacefully expressing opposition into the same category as the person planting a bomb or shooting a bullet.We came down on different sides inlast month’s voteon whether to proscribe Palestine Action, and neither of us have ever supported the group. But we both agree what is happening now neither protects protest nor makes protest policeable.We have three shared convictions. First, no one – including elected politicians and the police – should face violent threats or intimidation for doing the job that we ask of them, even if we disagree with how they do it. Second, everyone should be able to protest and engage in non-violent disruption without being lumped in with Islamic State, al-Qaida or the IRA. Third, legislation to uphold our civil rights and to stop intimidation should be cause-blind: protecting those whom we wish to beat at the ballot box by enabling all citizens to be heard and parliamentarians to do our jobs.How, then, should the government respond? First and foremost with common sense. Urgent police guidance should be issued to head off the car crash that proscription enforcement is rapidly becoming, by setting out a test of proportionality for any interventions. Proscribing the original Palestine Action group was said to be about stopping those inciting direct harm and violence. Going after people with a poster testing the boundaries of liberty – some who may or may not even support Palestine Action but feel strongly about Palestinian rights – confuses rather than clarifies the government’s intention. People must be able to protest about the horror in Gaza, and the focus should be on what is happening in Palestine, not in Parliament Square.The government should be much more transparent about how it is upholding our constitutional rights. There is no free speech if one half of a political debate lives in fear of being targeted for disagreeing. We need mechanisms to stop those who use violence, threaten migrants or hound women instead of raising their voices to achieve their goals. Lord David Anderson, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, argued that proscription should always be a time-limited process – and we agree. It should also be targeted at real terrorists whose explicit intention is to kill innocent civilians.No democratic state should make arbitrary decisions and must actively seek the consent of citizens. As it stands, how proscription is achieved – short parliamentary debates in both houses and, in the case of Palestine Action, bracketing the organisation along with two far-right groups in a single vote – fails this test. To have the ability to proscribe a group as “terrorists”, ministers and government must do much more to show the public how and why that is the case.‘I’m proud to have made this stand’: over-60s arrested at Palestine Action ban protest explain their decisionRead moreWe must also address the glaring inconsistencies and real gaps in law these cases reveal. Legislation on public order focuses on specific practices; proscription orders target specific terrorist groups. Nothing sits between this to recognise when organisations themselves encourage members repeatedly and deliberately to escalate intimidation in pursuit of their aim. Extreme groups create a climate of violence, leaving refugees waiting to be firebombed, Jewish citizens attacked, black and Muslim citizens living in fear, and women increasingly vilified.Getting the balance right means abolishing offences such as “recklessly encouraging support” of a proscribed group and focusing instead on those who organise this criminality. Setting out how and when behaviour threatens our democracy – as distinct from criticising state policies – would also better maintain the integrity of the seriousness of terrorism charges. Stopping organisations that are not simply accidentally violent, but intentionally so, means a new offence is needed, distinct from the battery of existing criminal ones. This would recognise how groups that encourage violence and intimidation go beyond existing public order offences, disentangling non-violent direct action from violence or attacks on property and terrorism.The alternative – accepting that harm to individuals is an inevitable risk of protest because people feel strongly about something – is not tenable. Terrorism is different from terrifying opponents, but both are or should be criminal offences. The failure to make that distinction is both increasingly infecting the policing of protest and undermining the legitimate right to protest.Anyone who thinks this situation is simple – either an egregiously authoritarian power-grab from the government or a sincere intention to block violent thuggery – isn’t paying attention. The status quo has come to mean equating peaceful witness with terrorism, and isn’t sustainable. But neither is pretending there isn’t a problem that threatens our ability to debate, disagree and ultimately decide in our democracy. Without action, it will be those with the loudest voices and the most lethal actors who win.Stella Creasy is the Labour and Cooperative MP for Walthamstow.

Is this progress?Mon 18 Aug 2025 07.38 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 08.14 EDTShareRemember the international outrage over alurid incidentinvolving a female dance critic, a male choreographer and a deposit of his pet dachshund’s excrement? In February 2023 the German choreographer Marco Goecke cornered Wiebke Hüster in the foyer of the Hanover State Opera during the interval of a show. Goecke, who was then artistic director of the venue, brought out a bag of dog poo from his pocket and pushed it into the journalist’s face. The reason? Hüster had written a negative review of his Netherlands-based show, In the Dutch Mountains, which had appeared in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (Faz) on the night of hishundekotattack.The incident sparked column inches of conversation in Germany on critical culture, with a ripple effect further afield: in the Netherlands, theatre criticscondemned itas an act of violence against freedom of expression; in the US, the American Theatre Critics Association did the same, with a blaze of accompanying newspaper headlines across Europe.Goeckelost his joband became a professional persona non grata. Good, I thought, as a critic who has been approached by some angry men myself in theatre auditoriums, though never with this level of repellently visceral aggression. The reaction was indubitable proof of the culture industry’s zero tolerance towards assault in Germany, right? Especially in a case involving a man attacking a woman in this publicly shaming way.Wrong. In May 2024, Goecke was appointed ballet director at Theater Basel for the upcoming 2025-26 season. He had remainedin the doghousefor just over a year despite all the hand-wringing in Germany. What does this say about the position of critics in general, and female reviewers in particular, given the misogynistic undertones in Goecke’s act, which seemed like a calculated aim to humiliate and degrade?Reflecting onthe episode in a newBBC Radio 4 documentaryabout the state of culture criticism in our fast-changing world of AI, algorithms and influencer-critics, Hüster spoke to me about her lack of surprise at Goecke’s rehabilitation. She had always assumed he would find work again. From a highly experienced critic who has been on the scene for several decades, what doesthatsay about gender dynamics in the arts? Shockingly, in the moments after the attack she felt grateful it had not been worse, despite her sense of violation. “I thought: ‘It’s bad – but it’s not a knife in your ribs,’” she said, and went on to describe the hate burning off her attacker, as if he bore an “absolute sincere wish to do me real harm”.Hüster’s vocabulary couldn’t sound more gendered, with Goecke’s behaviour akin to that of a stalker, not an artistic director. She herself puts the intensity of his reaction partly down to the fact that she was awomandoing a critical takedown – in one of Europe’s most influential papers. But inGermanyshe is far from the only female critic in the field. A Berlin theatre critic tells me there are far more female culture reviewers now than was previously the case. Hüster has seen this change too. The trend appears the same for UK criticism.And yet I fear that the optics of gender parity – or at least progress – are deceptive when set against the cold, hard facts. Asurvey conducted in 2019by the five-year Women in Theatre research project, whose partners include the Writers’ Guild, WOW (Women of the World) and Equity, among others, found that only 10% of the reviewing corps for drama were female. Subsequent reports in 2021and 2023corroborated this finding.This figure surprises and dismays me. It goes against the often-assumed pace of progress. So much so that Arts Council England’s national council governing body has just approved ayear-long taskforceto investigate the underrepresentation of and discrimination against women in the arts as a result of the Women in Theatre research project.Punched, insulted and excoriated in song … our critics on the artists who hit backRead moreAre we going backwards? Putting Hüster’s appalling experience aside, you could argue that the clashes between artists and critics nowadays are not half as fractious as they were a few decades ago, when criticism really was a macho sport with full-out eruptions of physical violence. This newspaper’s Michael Billington wasat the receiving endof a blow himself. That this no longer happens is a sign of progress, isn’t it? Well, it’s about optics again, because the punches are now thrown on social media, and so often, as findings reveal time and again, women are subjected to more vociferous attacks and pile-ons than their male counterparts.There were murmurs from some corners that Hüster’s review was unnecessarily harsh. I wonder if this judgment was cast because female critics are held to a different standard, however unconsciously – and whether we are expected to be less combative, more balanced? Hüster concedes that her review came with colourful language and humour. So what? It is just this kind of combative spirit that was espoused by William Blake in his idea that “opposition is true friendship”, that is, learning that occurs in the rich tension sparked between opposite viewpoints.Hüster also spoke to me of adhering to her own boundaries, never venturing into commentary that was personal or related to appearance. I hope male writers or directors havetheirboundaries too, especially if they approach a female critic to contest a review in person. I have had this several times, and have felt threatened by it. It’s a lonely job, as Hüster pointed out to me (and all the more so for the 10% of UK-based theatre critics who are female), but it really shouldn’t be a dangerous one.Where does all of this leave the female critic? Where Hüster is, I suppose. Whatever the implications of Goecke’s comeback, it is business as usual for her. “I have not changed because of that incident,” she said. “No, that would be awful.” Indeed.Arifa Akbar is the Guardian’s chief theatre critic.

When people have an ebike, theydrive less and cycle more. Astudyof frequent car drivers in Sweden found the distance people drove fell close to 40% once they were provided with an ebike.Conventional bikes don’t have anywhere near the same ability to get people out of their cars, due to their reliance on muscle power.Ebikes aren’t bikes as we’ve known them – they perform more like a car, motorbike or escooter. We need to start thinking of ebikes as adistinct form of transport.But as authoritiesgrapple witha tide of overpowered ebikes used illegally on roads, making the best use of these vehicles will also have to include clearer, tighter regulations.What do ebikes have over regular bikes?Ebikes overcome five challenges limiting use of conventional bikes:1. DistanceEbikes allow riders to go further than conventional bikes. Ebikes designed for city use offer a range of about 30km to 80km percharge. They’re particularly attractive inregional Australian townscharacterised by sprawl and little to no public transport. High-end ebikes can offer 100km in range or more, but come with big price tags. Riding 100km every week for a year would costabout $20in electricity to charge.2. HillsHilliness is a major challenge for many cyclists, especially those who aren’t fit or who ride bikes to get from place to place rather than for exercise. By contrast, the electric motors of ebikes make uphill climbs much more manageable. In hilly Australian cities such as Brisbane and Sydney, ebikes open up new routes.The ebike commute challenge: could I do daycare drop-off and get to work faster than driving?Read more3. WeatherPeople don’t like to ride conventional bikes as much if it’s very hot or cold. Ebikes require less physical effort, meaning riders sweat less in hot weather. In the cold, ebikes can increase wind chill compared with a conventional bike, but they also help riders reach their destinations faster and reduce overall exposure to cold. Owners do have to take weather into account, because cold can reduce battery life, while heat can reduce how long a battery lasts. Long exposure to heavy rain may damage ebikes too. Good undercover storage is necessary.4. CargoRiding a pushbike with two kids or groceries on board is challenging. Extra weight requires extra effort. Cargo ebikes make it much easier to transport loads between 100 and 200kg. These models are heavier and bulkier than regular ebikes, making storage and manoeuvring in tight spaces more difficult.5. Physical limitationsEbikes can be a useful option for groups who can’t easily use conventional bikes. These includeolder adults, pregnant people and individuals with medical conditions limiting their movement. Caution does have to be taken, though. The sudden acceleration of an ebike can startle riders and increase risk of falls, while travelling at higher speeds can be challenging for those with slower reflexes. Proper training is essential.Risks stem from regulatory failureLike any form of transport, ebikes come with risks. Reports of ebikescatching fireandhitting pedestrianshave triggered public anxiety and even proposals torestrict or banthem.Many residential and commercial buildings have banned ebike charging or parking indoors to avoid any battery fires, whilepublic transport banshave been floated.The reality is,battery firesandlethal crashesare overwhelmingly due to non-compliant ebikes with low-quality batteries or with power levels well beyond the limit legally allowed on Australian roads.Many of these vehicles shouldn’t be thought of as ebikes. They’re more like unregistered illegalelectric motorcycles.What defines a true ebike?Most countries have adopted theEuropean EN15194 ebike standard, which defines an ebike as a vehicle with:continuous rated power of no more than 250 wattsmaximum pedal-assisted speed of 25km/hmaximum speed of 6km/h when using only a throttleIt must also meet the safe battery standards (known asEN50604).Unfortunately, in 2021 the Australian government removed ebikes fromits definitionof a “road vehicle”. BarWestern Australia, all Australian states followed suit.When two wheels are better than four: a buyer’s guide to ebikesRead moreAt a stroke, non-compliant vehicles became exempt from import standards. Overpowered vehicles with questionable batteries could be freely imported – as long as they were only used on private land.This loophole has been widely used to import thousands of dangerous vehicles. Once in Australia, many end up on the roads. Some souped-up or illegally modified bikes can reach speeds as high as 90km/h – and havecaused deaths. These models have also become popular amongyounger Australians.If nothing is done, the flood of illegal and unsafe models could undermine the real benefits of ebikes.In recent months,cycling researchersandadvocacy groupshavecalledfor authorities tostep inand close loopholes permitting the import of illegal devices, ban their sale and encourage uptake of European-standard ebikes.A new form of transportEbikes are quietly revolutionary. Once the ebike sector is properly regulated, authorities should focus on making the most of their potential.Separated lanesare vitaland are especially important for ebike riders, who can travel faster and may be more at risk of injury if they crash compared with traditional bikes.Temporary subsidies are another option to drive uptake. Researchers overseashave shownthe benefits from ebike subsidies outweigh the cost.If we do this right, millions of Australians could eventually rely on an ebike rather than a car.Richard J Buning is a research lead at the Micromobility Research Cluster at the University of Queensland and Dorina Pojani is an associate professor in urban planning at the University of QueenslandThis article was originally published inthe ConversationExplore more on these topicsElectric vehiclesOpinionTransportCycling (Life and style)Cycling (News)commentShareReuse this content"

Today, they are all dead.I spoke with various members of the Gaza teamwhile writinga profile of Gaza’s veteran reporterWael al-Dahdouh, who lost his wife, three of his children and grandson. All spoke of their work as a duty that needed to be carried out despite the risks. Three members of that team have since been killed in a chain of assassinations. Each time I sent condolences, the response was always that the coverage would not cease. “We are continuing,” the Gaza editor told me last week, after he lost his entire Gaza City team in the targeted strike that claimed the lives of Sharif, Mohammed Nofal, Ibrahim Thaher and Qraiqea. “We will not betray their message, or their last wishes.”As these killings dazed the world – and the response to them became mired in unproven and in some casesrisibly implausible claimsthat some of these journalists were militants – little has been said about the calibre of journalism in Gaza. How fluent, articulate and poised its journalists are under impossible circumstances. How much they manage to capture horrific events and pain on a daily basis, in a journalistic Arabic that they have perfected to an art, while maintaining a professional, collected presence on camera. How much they manage to keep their cool. I struggled often to translate their words into English, so rich and expansive is their expression. Even Sharif’sfinal message, a text for the ages, loses some of its power in translation. In it, he addresses those who “choked” our breath, but the word he uses is closer to “besieged” – evoking not just physical asphyxiation but the silencing of a surveilled people’s voice.What strikes me when I speak with journalists in and from Gaza is how evangelical and heartbreakingly idealistic they are; how much journalism to them was a duty even if it meant certain death. All who have been killed had a choice, and those who are still alive and reporting still do. Sharif said he had beenthreatened several timesby Israeli authorities over the past two years. Al Jazeera told me that he was sent a warning by Israeli intelligence and told to stop reporting. When he refused, his father waskilled in an airstrike. When Ghoul took over from Dahdouh early last year, Dahdouh told him that it was a dangerous job, and no one would fault him for leaving his post and returning to his wife and child. Ghoul refused, and wasdecapitated in a targeted strike.What the Israeli government is trying to do with these killings is not just stop the stream of damning reports and footage, but annihilate the very image of Palestinians that these media professionals convey. The credibility, dignity and talent that Gaza’s journalists exhibit to the world in their reports and social media posts has to be extinguished. The more Gaza is a place that is teeming with militants, where there are no reliable narrators, and where Israel’s justifications for killing and starvation cannot be challenged by plausible witnesses, the easierIsraelcan prosecute its genocidal campaign.1:22Al Jazeera's Anas al-Sharif among five journalists killed by Israel in Gaza – videoA recent investigation by +972 Magazine and Local Call identified thesinisterly named “legitimisation cell”, a unit of the Israeli military tasked, in the words of the report, with “identifying Gaza-based journalists it could portray as undercover Hamas operatives, in an effort to blunt growing global outrage over Israel’s killing of reporters”. According to the investigation’s sources, the effort is “driven by anger that Gaza-based reporters were ‘smearing [Israel’s] name in front of the world’”.Central to this effort is Israel’s ability to rely on western media to treat its claims as somehow plausible, despite the fact that time and time again, it has made claims that turn out not to be true. Emergency workers who were killed because they were “advancing suspiciously”, according to the IDF, were said to befound in restraintswith execution-style shots. The claim that Hamas was systematically stealing aid, which is used to justify blockade and starvation, wascontradicted by sourceswithin the Israeli military itself.It is Hamas that is shooting Palestinians queueing for aid,Israel has said, not us.Eventually, this behaviour deserves to be called what it is: systemic deception that forfeits your right to be a credible authority. And still we are told that Israel has killed a journalist, buthere is Israel’s claimthat the journalist was a militant. You can make up your mind. The resulting ambiguity means that even if these claims cannot be verified, they are imbued with potential truth. Do you see how that works?On Gaza’s killing fields, journalism faces its darkest hour – but that won’t stop us reporting | Asef HamidiRead moreThe truth is that journalists inGazahave been colossally failed by many of their colleagues in the western media – not just in terms of how their killings are reported, but in how the entire conflict is described. Figures of the dead and starving in Gaza are often described as coming from “Hamas-run” ministries, but you don’t see the statements coming from Israeli authorities caveated as serially unreliable, or the phrase “wanted by the international criminal court” attached to the name Benjamin Netanyahu.Meanwhile, the word of Palestinian journalists is never quite enough – not until foreign media (who are not allowed into Gaza) can give the final gold-standard judgment. They are cast out of the body of journalism, their truth buried along with them.In Gaza, however, there will always be someone brave and clear-eyed who continues the coverage. Who puts on a press flak jacket that makes them a target. They continue to bear, alone, the responsibility of bringing the world the reality of events in Gaza, even as their voices and breaths are besieged.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

How many will die before politicians finally act?John HarrisThere’s been fury in Spain over the tragic death of a street cleaner. It’s not hard to imagine something similar playing out in the UKMon 18 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 04.55 EDTShareMontse Aguilar was only 51when she died. She lived in the El Poble-sec area of Barcelona – it translates from Catalan as “the dry village” – where she cared for her 85-year-old mother and sang in a local choir. For three years, she had worked as a city street cleaner for an outsourcing company, wearing a lime-green uniform – made, her family later said, from “100% polyester … a material used to make coats”.On 28 June, her shift in the city’s Gothic Quarter began at 2.30pm and ended seven hours later. The temperature that day had reached more than 35C, which left workers like her exposed: Spain has a clearer system of regulations covering heat and work than a lot of other countries, but it is still full of gaps.That afternoon, Aguilar had sent a friend a WhatsApp message: “Sorry for not answering sooner, it’s just been a really bad afternoon. Not just because of the shit [ie the rubbish], but I thought I was going to die. I’m getting pains in my arms, chest and neck, cramps.” She also seems to have told one of her managers about how awful she was feeling. When she returned home, she collapsed and hit her head. Attempts by paramedics to revive her were unsuccessful.The reaction to Aguilar’s death has been furious. On 16 July, people marched behind banners that read: “Extreme heat is also workplace violence”. Street cleaners demanded better summer workwear and more breaks. They claimed that some of the most crucial new rules announced by local politicians and officials – supposedly to ensure that outdoor workers had breathable uniforms – had not been put into practice. By then, Aguilar’s family was readyinglegal action: if her autopsy showed she had died of heatstroke, her relatives said they would sue Aguilar’s employers and the city council.After days of searing heat in the UK, it is not hard to imagine a version of this story happening in this country – and to see that, at the intersection ofwork and the climate crisis, there is already a huge tangle of increasingly urgent issues. As temperatures in this corner of northern Europe once again scrape the mid-30s, what must it be like to work in warehouses and factories with precious little ventilation, let alone air conditioning? How do builders and bike couriers cope? And what are working lives like in parts of the economy from which people completely avert their eyes?In the heatwave that hit us a month ago, I was in Exmoor, where I saw a pizzeria tell its customers that for the sake of their kitchen staff, they had no choice but to temporarily shut. But as people were turned away, I kept thinking of thedark kitchensthat supply many of the food-delivery companies concentrated in our cities: tiny workplaces baldly described in a report by the Royal Society for Public Health as “small boxes” where food is produced in a “dark, cramped and low paid environment which is frequently either too hot or too cold”.Whereas European countries such as Belgium, Hungary and Slovenia have working regulations built aroundclear temperature limits, what passes for this country’s system of rules and regulations on work and heat is a very British mess of half-measures and mere recommendations. For those working indoors,official guidancesuggests a minimum temperature of 16C, which falls to 13C if people are doing “physical work”. But neither hardened legislation nor small-print guidance specifies any maximum temperatures – nor, indeed, many comprehensive rules that cover people who work in the open air.Health and safety legislation and industry-specific regulations offer some protection to workers outdoors in such trades as construction and railway maintenance. But there is an awful sense of the severity of extreme weather finding no reflection in the law.From around the world, there is an ongoing torrent of stories highlighting tensions and problems that can easily be copied across to the working lives of people in any number of other countries. In South Korea, construction workers point out that as the air reaches 35C, concrete and asphalt intensify the heat even further, andtell journalists: “In a summer like this, we think every day that we may die.” In northern India, the city of Varanasi has recently seen dozens of delivery workerscut adriftby the companies they work for, after they took part in protests demanding heat safety measures. In stories such as these, there are glimmers of demands that will soon become globally inescapable – not just for drastically altered conditions, but radically different ways of living.Spanish people know deadly heatwaves are now an annual event. So why are our politicians in denial? | María RamírezRead moreIn the UK, there are signs of deepening political tensions that another hot summer could make explosive. Before last year’s election,Labour acknowledgedthat “in a number of sectors, working temperatures are regularly unacceptably high” and said it would commit to “modernising health and safety guidance with reference to extreme temperatures”. As part of her plans to upgrade workplace rights, Angela Raynerrepeated the last pledgeonce her party was in government. The Health and Safety Executive is now working on measures that would allow workers to insist on new protections from heat, and make it obligatory for employers to carry out “heat stress assessments”.Quite rightly, the trade unions want more. For the past few years, the TUC – supported by its big member organisations – has been pushing for acut-off temperaturein indoor workplaces of 30C, or 27C if people are doing strenuous jobs. It also demands much more flexible working, and outdoor shifts that sit either side of the middle of the day. But the signals from Whitehall seem maddeningly hesitant. Perhaps because of the government’s belief in sweeping away regulation and reducing red tape, its spokespeople insist there are “no plans to introduce a maximum workplace temperature”, while ministersbat away callsfor legislation that would allow British workers to be sent home during extreme heat.What is really striking is how awkwardly searing heat sits with views of work that are common across the political establishment. Human frailty, we are told, must be no barrier to getting a job. As evidenced by new rumblings about the pension agebeing raised to 68, the same logic is being applied to people in what used to be considered old age – which is precisely when sensitivity to heat can become fatal. This is an aspect of climate denial that is still completely overlooked, crystallised in glaring contrasts: between the wilting parcel-deliverer or ageing supermarket worker stoically pushing shopping trolleys across baking asphalt, and the politicians still failing to look ahead to a recalibration of work that will surely become inevitable much sooner than they think. As labour becomes ever more a matter of life and death, how could it be otherwise?John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsExtreme heatOpinionWorkers' rightsClimate crisisWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

At this rate, we will be passing on a lower standard of living, diminished health and education outcomes, and a degraded environment to younger Australians.The most recent federal election was defined by embarrassing small-mindedness from the major parties – promises of $7 off your weekly fuel bill or a $5 tax cut. These are not serious solutions to the structural challenges we face.When you combine these small-target strategies with the increasing need to show an electoral “mandate” before tackling any policy issue, how will we ever address the big challenges?Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThere are two schools of thought about how reform happens: one argues that it requires a strong majority government; the other believes it will take a minority government pushed by a principled crossbench.The fact that overall support for the major parties fell again with 33.6% of voters supporting community independent or minor party candidates demonstrates increasing frustration at the major parties’ unwillingness to confront Australia’s long-term challenges.The election of independents to the crossbench was driven by two decades of gridlock on economic reform, coupled with a lack of a coherent approach to climate change mitigation. During the 2022 election campaign and immediately after, I spoke of the urgent need for broad tax reform. In the last parliament, I raised this issue in the house 10 times. Allegra Spender spoke about it 21 times. The major parties avoided the topic entirely.I was heartened by the treasurer’s decision to expand the agenda for the economic reform roundtable to include tax reform. Could this be the moment when the government finally confronts the structural challenges in our budget and the demographic shifts ahead?It was refreshing to hear the treasurer push back against the “rule in, rule out” game that has stifled meaningful debate for years. But unfortunately, the prime minister is managing our expectations down to tinkering.The case for tax reform is compelling and GST provides an opportunity. Our current tax system disproportionately burdens younger Australians. Bracket creep – the stealthy tax increase on workers – is our only plan for addressing the deficit.We need to explore alternatives with productivity in mind. The economist Chris Murphy has shown that, per extra dollar of revenue raised, the GST causes the least economic harm, followed by personal income tax, and then company tax.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It applies to just 7.5% of the economy, compared with an OECD average of over 11%, and its rate is half the OECD average. Broadening the base and increasing the rate could allow us to shift the tax burden from those who work to those who spend.In anticipation of the roundtable, the economist Richard Holden and I revisited our 2023 work and asked the Parliamentary Budget Office to model a “progressive GST” – a way to relieve pressure on personal income tax while protecting low- and middle-income earners.Under our model, the GST rate would increase to 15% and exemptions would be removed. To ensure equity, every Australian adult would receive a $3,300 annual payment, effectively making the first $22,000 of spending GST-free. PBO modelling shows this could leave the bottom 60% of income earners better off, even before accounting for the personal income tax cuts enabled by the additional $24bn in revenue.This is the test. The Labor government has a 19-seat majority. If a comfortable margin is truly a prerequisite for reform, now is the time to act.If we see no action now and the major parties decide an electoral mandate is required, they are now on notice. The voters are on to you. You have three years to build community support for a bold and viable plan to fix our tax system.Any party that wants to be taken seriously as a contender for government in 2028 must come to the election with a tax plan that is fair, future-focused and fit for the demographic changes ahead.

Victor discusses bootcamp with Barry Jenkins – and what you can learn from working in a bridal shopAdrian HortonMon 18 Aug 2025 10.10 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareIn late 2020, the actor and comedian Eva Victor decamped from New York to their cousin’s house in rural Maine with a surprise window of time and an urgent subject. Covid had shut down production onBillions, Showtime’s soapy finance drama on which Victor scored their first regular acting gig. Moonlight directorBarry Jenkins, a fan of Victor’s short comedy videos on social media, had DM-ed to offer encouragement and a request: send a script when you’re ready.That year, everything felt incomprehensibly big – global pandemic, political upheaval, social fracturing. But alone in wintry Maine, Victor turned far inwards, towards a quiet personal trauma. “It’s like a stone gets shoved into the river of your life. There’s a lot of pain in trying to remove it and you can’t,” says Victor. “You just have to find a way for the water to move around it. It’s so unfair that someone threw a stone into your life. It’s hard to wrap your head around any of it.”I didn’t want to show the violence. I wanted to talk about what happens after itThe stone was sexual assault, and the film – Victor’s directorial debut, produced by Jenkins – isSorry, Baby, a remarkably sharp portrait of healing that quietly upends the prevailing script on sexual violence in the long wake of #MeToo.The film wowed audiences at Sundance and Cannes and garnered word-of-mouth buzz in the US when it was released in June, acclaimed for its welcome reimagining of what critic Parul Sehgal memorably termed the “trauma plot”: trauma as a flattening explanation and defining event. “I think we often paint people as victims,” says Victor. “In that way we make them tragic figures and try to look away from them. Or we make them just one thing, and people are complicated.”Sorry, Baby presents trauma as an idiosyncratic, fickle, mutable thing, as opposed to the blunt, annihilating force that animates numerous films and TV showsloosely grouped under the #MeToo umbrella, from the black heart of Emerald Fennell’sPromising Young Womanto the deadening shock of Zoë Kravitz’sBlink Twice.View image in fullscreenSoapy drama ... Victor in Billions.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyVictor plays Agnes, a twentysomething English academic in a small New England town who, about 25 minutes into the film, experiences something awful. She goes to the home of her thesis supervisor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), after he changes the location of their meeting at the last minute. The camera lingers outside the house, the darkening sky saying all you need to know. “I wanted the film to talk about what happens after this kind of violence,” says Victor. “I didn’t want to show it.”Afterwards Agnes drives home in mute horror, and tells her best friend, Lydie (Naomi Ackie), what happened in jumbled, detached details. Neither say the word rape, but they both know; Lydie confirms: “Yeah, that’s the thing.” The rest of the film, which proceeds in one chapter per year, builds on principles that feel true to life: that processing is non-linear and inconsistent; that the self is multifaceted and mutable; that life goes on in a whole variety of tones; that trauma can shape a person but not define them. “Ultimately we’re all just afraid,” says Victor. “We don’t want it to be possible that it could happen to someone like us. So we make it seem as if they are particular people who it’s meant to happen to.”View image in fullscreen‘I really wanted to give them a fighting chance at being whole people’ ... Victor.Photograph: Matt Licari/Invision/APIn conversation, Victor is much like their film: warm, chatty, at turns wise and childlike, their long sleeves covering their hands. We discuss the demise of a particularly excellent sandwich shop in Brooklyn, where Victor lived until relocating to Los Angeles last year. They now live in the same city as their best friend – fittingly, as the most important fact about Agnes, at least to the viewer, is her close friendship with Lydie. We first meet the pair four years after the assault, during a heady reunion marked by the half-finished thoughts and tangled limbs of intimate, platonic love. The trauma is tacitly acknowledged, shown clearly in the gulf between how Lydie’s life galloped – city, marriage, baby – while Agnes’s crawled. “I really wanted to give them a fighting chance at being whole people,” says Victor of the first chapter. “If Agnes and Lydie can be these full people who we love, it’s harder to look away from them later on when a bad thing happens. It’s harder to paint Agnes as something, or to categorise her.”The friendship also provides the canvas for comedy, and Sorry, Baby is – crucially – funny, its characters often speaking in stilted, off-the-cuff blurts. Victor walks a tonal tightrope between deadpan and earnest, the result of years spent working on a comedy career. Raised in San Francisco, they studied acting and playwriting at Northwestern University in Illinois and were active in the school’s improv scene. A few days after graduating in 2016, they moved to New York with aspirations to work on a late-night chatshow. They landed, instead, at the feminist satirical website Reductress, cranking out four to five posts a day (“insane”) and poking fun at the girlbossing cliches of the time. (“Get it, bitch! This woman got in the shower.”)For a few years, they lived the aspiring comic’s life in New York: standup sets, acting gigs and part-time jobs, including one fitting customers at a bridal shop. (“I was very bad at it,” says Victor, but “it taught me a lot about gender, and how euphoric it can be for some women to feel like women and how dysphoric it can feel for others.”) There were many unsuccessful auditions, scripts that “just weren’t landing. I was wanting to make things, but I felt as if no one was letting me. And I was like, ‘That’s not fair, I’m just going to do it.’”View image in fullscreenHard to look away from ... Naomi Ackie as Lydie and Victor as Agnes in Sorry, Baby.Photograph: BFA/AlamyVictor started posting short videos to what was then Twitter, in which they played arch, spiralling characters – a woman explaining to her boyfriend why they’re going to straight pride, a womanwhodefinitelydidn’t kill her husband. Many went viral. Jenkins messaged, and Victor took another crack at screenwriting, although not, they say, intending to speak to anything bigger than themselves, nor against a certain trauma trope. They drew from the interiority in Kelly Reichardt’s Certain Women, the understatement in Andrew Haigh’s45 Years, the beauty of Wong Kar-wai’sIn the Mood for Love. And they watched Michaela Coel’s “completely transcendent” BBC-HBO seriesI May Destroy You– perhaps the closest antecedent to Sorry, Baby in terms of treating trauma as a thread, rather than the whole cloth. “You see someone doing something so truthfully, and you wonder: ‘What’s my version of that?’” says Victor.After reading a first draft of the script in 2021, Jenkins encouraged Victor to direct. Having worked with first-time film-makers on two searing debuts – Charlotte Wells’sAftersunand Raven Jackson’sAll Dirt Roads Taste of Salt– Jenkins and his producing partners Adele Romanski and Mark Ceryak put Victor in an ad-hoc directing bootcamp, practising certain shots and shadowing Jane Schoenbrun on the set of their acclaimed filmI Saw the TV Glow, before filming for Sorry, Baby commenced in Massachusetts in 2024.Sorry, Baby is a smart film about sexual assault and it’s here at just the right time | Adrian HortonRead moreAlthough years in the making, Sorry, Baby’s smallness, its bracing but uncynical honesty, feels of the moment. The collective momentum of the #MeToo movement has dissipated; backlash (and, often, hellish litigation) hasengulfedmany women who spoke up; catharsis did not lead to material change. Agnes and Lydie are pessimistic about the chances of accountability, and understandably wary of the criminal justice system. All Agnes has – all anyone has – is herself, her life, her friends. Victor still bristles at any larger movement critique; many times during this press tour, they’ve been asked some version of: What does this say about the #MeToo movement? “And I’m like, ‘Well, by the way, what are we even talking about?’” they laugh. “All I know is this one version of this story, all I want to talk about is this attempt at healing.”Victor is also reticent on the inspiration for that experience; making movies may be the opposite speed of social media posts, but virality taught Victor “how little I want people to know about my personal life”. They have maintained a privacy line throughout interviews for the film. “I say it’s a very personal story, which is true. And I say it is narrative fiction, in which I find a lot of comfort and joy, because I got to make Agnes and build a world around her that supports the exact story I want to tell.”And that story is not just trauma – it’s professional success, grief about friends entering a different life-stage, ambivalence about getting older, and the loneliness of being on your own timeline. Agnes, in these chapters, is “very much in process,” says Victor. “As we all are.”Sorry, Baby is in UK cinemas from 22 August and Australian cinemas from 4 SeptemberInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

But someone fired a flare gun into the ceiling and – whoosh! The whole building went up in flames’Interviews byDave SimpsonMon 18 Aug 2025 08.54 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 21.30 EDTShareRoger Glover, bass, songwriterWe wanted a more exciting sound than we had been getting in conventional recording studios, so hired the Rolling Stones’ mobile studio for three weeks to record in the Montreux casino. It was 1971 and the night before we were due to begin, we went to see Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention play in the casino as part of the Montreux jazz festival, but – as the song puts it – “some stupid with a flare gun” fired into the ceiling.Sparks came down and everyone had to get out. I became separated from the band so went back inside to find them. The place was empty, but just as I came out something exploded and whoosh – the whole building went up in flames.We sat in the bar of our hotel a couple of blocks away and watched the plume of black smoke as the beautiful old casino was reduced to charred wood. A couple of mornings later I was aware that I’d said the phrase “smoke on the water” loudly into the room as I woke up. Later, after guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had come up with a mid-tempo riff, I suggested Smoke on the Water as the title of a song about what had happened to us.The last time we were in Montreux, there were signs by the lake reading: 'No smoking on the water'There’s a great photograph of singer Ian Gillan with his notebook open and the first two verses written. I’m sat opposite him listening to Ritchie’s guitar through headphones. Ian and I were throwing lyrical ideas to each other and we had the song within maybe 15 minutes. It came out as if we were writing in a journal, beginning: “We all came out to Montreux, on the Lake Geneva shoreline”. “Funky Claude” is Claude Nobs, the jazz festival founder, a lovely man who was running round “pulling kids out” as his world went up in flames.Montreux has always been special to us because of what happened. The last time we were there, signs by the lake read “No smoking on the water” and four jets released smoke over the water as we played. That felt very emotional, but I never get tired of playing the song. Someone once said it’s like having a button that you press to make the audience go nuts.Ian Paice, drums, songwriterBefore it had any lyrics, Smoke on the Water was known as “the der-der-der song” because of Ritchie’s riff. After the casino burned down, Claude found us a place called the Pavillon ballroom, where we started playing around with it. Jon Lord doubled up the riff on organ, but with inversions to the chords. Roger’s bass playing was really solid and that gave me room to flash around, so the drums build up in a crescendo. We had just started recording when there were flashing lights outside and the police arrived. The roadies managed to hold the doors shut until we’d finished the take. Then a police officer said: “You must stop! You are too loud!”Claude suggested we continue at the closed Grand Hotel, by which time Ritchie decided he didn’t want the slow song When a Blind Man Cries on the Machine Head album. That left us a track short, but our engineerMartin Birchreminded us of “that first thing we did in the Pavillon”. Once Ian Gillan and Roger started telling the story in the lyrics, it started to become Smoke on the Water.We finished recording it on the ground floor corridor of the hotel, having raided the rooms and used mattresses to block any sound leaking, hence the line “a few red lights and a few old beds”. At that point it was just another album track. We had no idea it would become really important, but the public decide those things.Warner Bros in Los Angeles loved it but said it was too long for the radio, so unbeknown to us one of their engineers cut it down to four minutes. The rest is history, as they say. On the Made in Japan live version we’d been playing it for a year and had found all these little nooks and crannies to explore, so it’s different. The audience did the hand claps in time with the riff. Ian had trouble hearing through the monitors that night in Osaka so at the end he says that wonderful line: “I want everything louder than everything else!” A good 40 years after we recorded it, I was playing with one of my little pickup bands in a restaurant in Italy and someone said the chef wanted to say hello. He came up to me and said: “I was the chef in the casino when it burned down.”Deep Purple’s Made in Japan (50th Anniversary Edition) is out nowExplore more on these topicsPop and rockHow we madeMetalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then he has a stunningly frank encounter with a woman who has hated him for three decadesJack SealeMon 18 Aug 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 17.35 EDTShareEarly on in Confessions of a Brain Surgeon, a crew member pipes up from behind the camera. Would Henry Marsh mind saying something, anything, to see if the microphones are working? “When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,” Marsh says instantly, not pausing for a moment to gather the words, “I all alone beweep my outcast state, and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, and look upon myself and curse my fate.” A simple “testing testing, one two” would be standard practice, but Marsh is not your standard documentary subject.Marsh is a retired neurosurgeon, having spent decades at the top of his profession. You’ve probably seen hospital documentaries that have featured an “awake craniotomy”, the macabre procedure that keeps a patient with a sawn-open skull conscious, so the effect of the scalpel’s cuts can be monitored in real time. Marsh, along with his longterm colleague, anaesthetist Judith Dinsmore, pioneered that. He performed numerous other exceptionally advanced operations with unique skill. Countless patients who were told by less able, less imaginative medics that they were terminally ill were treated successfully by Marsh.At 75, Marsh is physically and mentally agile, but his own diagnosis of prostate cancer has caused him to reflect. In Charlie Russell and Harriet Bird’s exquisite film, he reviews diaries and home movie footage, and meets important people from his past.So how does this man, the one with Shakespeare sonnets ready on his tongue, feel to have been the best at the vocation we use as shorthand for the world’s hardest job? “All surgeons carry inside themselves an inner cemetery,” he says. “A place full of bitterness and regret.” Every professional lifesaver is haunted by the people they were unable to help, but Marsh is so troubled by the relatively few patients who died on his table that he can’t take pleasure in his many successes. He struggles even to remember them.Confessions of a Brain Surgeon is his quest to rectify that, and make peace with himself. The result, powered by Marsh’s pitiless acuity and disarming eccentricity, is a deep meditation on what it means to have lived: death hands us a ledger of triumphs and mistakes, the happiness we’ve spread tallied against the pain we’ve inflicted. Was it all worth it?Marsh remembers a 16-year-old girl who had a life-altering stroke after her operation. He remembers patients who did not survive at all. Reviewing his trips to Ukraine, which he has visited regularly as a volunteer since 1992, he finds footage of Tania, a girl he brought back to London but could not cure. “I look at this with complete horror,” he says, peering through the thick, round spectacles that enhance his hawkish gaze. “Horror” is the word he uses most often.With the help of his first wife, Hilary, Marsh also looks back at the negative effect his calling had on his personal life. Was he a workaholic who sacrificed his family’s happiness to drive himself forward? Yes, but as with seemingly everything in Marsh’s life, matters had a cruelly precise balance and inevitability to them. He chose to train as a neurosurgeon after his first child, William, became seriously ill at the age of three months. The baby recovered after a successful brain operation but the ordeal was, Marsh says, “horror beyond horror”.An already piercingly emotional documentary shifts up a gear during Marsh’s meeting with a woman named Tina. Almost thirty years ago, Tina’s four-year-old son Max had a brain tumour, and Marsh said he could fix it. He was wrong. In a stunningly frank exchange, Tina admits that she has carried a hatred for Marsh ever since Max died; Marsh admits that he misdiagnosed the type of tumour Max had “because I was arrogant”. But then Tina lets go and forgives, for the simple reason that Marsh has full recall of the case: he remembered her little Max. Suddenly this brusque scientist leans across the table and grasps both Tina’s trembling hands. “Of course I remembered.”Further redemption comes from reunions with Dinsmore, the anaesthetist, who reminds Marsh of the great work they did; and his long-serving secretary Gail, who says it was an honour to assist him. Then there is an old patient, Jude, who was a new mum in 2002 when she was told by doctors that her tumour was inoperable. Marsh disagreed; Jude recently saw her son graduate. In her house, Marsh is shown a wall of family photos, each memory a gift bestowed by the dedication that has brought him unimaginable anguish. Was it all worth it? The film ends with Marsh still weighing the evidence, but we’re given reason to hope that his answer will be yes.Confessions of a Brain Surgeon aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewNeuroscienceHealthreviewsShareReuse this content"

It has a funny circularity that chimes with the self-aware nature of the show. Looking us in the eye, Belgian actors Verona Verbakel and Anemone Valcke tell us they are committed to being truthful. It is a promise that puts us on alert: do we really believe everything they say? How much is artifice? How much constructed?They confess to misleading us in one respect. The show is only superficially about egotism. There is a nice joke when Verbakel describes The Ego as her show, then remembers Valcke and attributes it to both of them. They flatter each other and glow with the praise. In their anecdotes from film sets and award ceremonies, they present themselves as actors who are hungry for the spotlight, insecure about rejection and in need of affirmation. Their ego drives their ambition and punishes their failures.Scott Turnbull presents … Surreally Good review – that’s edutainment!Read moreBut is their ego really what makes them feel so vulnerable? Or could it more accurately be their need to please in a ruthlessly competitive industry? Could their frustrations stem from having to suppress their rage at a post-#MeToo culture in which anti-female bias and microaggressions persist? Should a woman expect to be a male director’s muse; should she tolerate a male actor’s onstage kisses; should she welcome a new age of equality when a gender-blind acting award goes only to men?Like several shows at this year’s Edinburgh fringe, The Ego is not about the most obvious abuses of male power and perhaps not even about behaviour that would meet the legal threshold of discrimination. Rather, it reflects a world in which women in their early 30s (they both appeared inSirens by Ontroerend Goedmore than 10 years ago) still find themselves constrained, moulded and defined by men. Their experiences dent their ego but their ego is not to blame.AtZoo Playground, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalFestivalsTheatreActingComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

Does its author think the technology could write a better novel than a human?Mon 18 Aug 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 10.04 EDTShare“Idon’t feel particularly unhappy about my work being used to train AI,” says Japanese novelist Rie Qudan. “Even if it is copied, I feel confident there’s a part of me that will remain, which nobody can copy.”The 34-year old author is talking to me via Zoom from her home near Tokyo, ahead of the publication of the English-language translation of her fourth novel, Sympathy Tower Tokyo.The book attracted controversy in Japan when it won a prestigious prize, despite being partly written by ChatGPT.The author speaks conversational English, but her translator, Jesse Kirkwood, is also on the line, interpreting questions and answers when needed. At the heart of Sympathy Tower Tokyo is a Japanese architect, Sara Machina, who has been commissioned to build a new tower to house convicted criminals. It will be a representation of what one character – not without irony – calls “the extraordinary broadmindedness of the Japanese people”, in that the tower will house offenders in compassionate comfort.In the novel, Sara, herself a victim of violent crime, wonders if this sympathetic approach to criminals is appropriate. Does this sympathy reflect Japanese society in reality?“It’s definitely prevalent,” says Qudan. One of the triggers for writing the novel, she adds, was theassassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abein July 2022. “The person who shot him became the centre of a lot of attention in Japan – and his background elicited a lot of sympathy from people. He had grown up in a heavily religious household, and been deprived of freedom. That idea had been in my head for a long time, and when I came to write the novel, it came out again as part of the process.”The question of public attitudes towards criminals runs through the story, in serious and satirical ways. Potential residents of the tower must take a “Sympathy Test” to determine if they are deserving of compassion (“Have your parents ever acted violently towards you? – Yes / No / Don’t know”) … and the ultimate decision will be made by AI.Changes of language over the last few decades are affecting how people act or view thingsSympathy Tower Tokyo won the Akutagawa prize in 2024 for new or rising authors when it was first published. She was “delighted”, she says, but also “liberated, because once you make your debut as a writer, there’s a constant pressure to win this prize”. In 2022, she had been nominated for her book Schoolgirl, but didn’t win. “I felt I’d let people down by not winning the prize, and that was something I didn’t want to repeat. You know, with that prize it stays with you your whole life.”But the book also grabbed attention because Qudan said that part of it – 5% was the figure given, though she now says that was only an approximation – was written using artificial intelligence. This, she tells me, comprised parts of the novel which are presented as a character’s exchange with ChatGPT. But Qudan also “gained a lot of inspiration” for the novel through “exchanges with AI and from the realisation that it can reflect human thought processes in interesting ways”. Qudan’s use of AI, in other words, seeks not to deceive the reader but to help us to see its effects.One character feels pity for the chatbot, “condemned to an empty life of endlessly spewing out the language it was told to spew, without ever understanding what this cut-and-paste patchwork of other people’s words meant”.Does Qudan fear that AI will supplant human writers? “Maybe a future will come when that happens, but right now there’s no way an AI can write a novel that’s better than a human author.” Among Japanese readers, Sympathy Tower Tokyo “did get attention for using AI. But more than that, it was a focus on the language itself which really generated discussion; how the changes of language over the last few decades are affecting how people act or view things.”And this feeds into the key issue at the heart of Qudan’s book. Sympathy Tower Tokyo is really all about language, which in the book is not just how we express ourselves, but how we reveal ourselves. “Words determine our reality,” says one character.By using katakana, a lot of negative associations can be replaced by neutral one. It doesn’t trigger people in the same wayIn the novel, a key debate is around the growth of katakana in Japan – that is, the script used to write foreign-derived words. Words rendered in katakana (as opposed to hiragana script and kanji characters, which are used to write traditional Japanese words) resemble transliterations of English – “negurekuto” for neglect, “fōrin wākāzu” for foreign workers – and to Japanese ears they are “milder, more euphemistic” than traditional kanji words, and can avoid “discriminatory turns of phrase”. The character Sara thinks “Japanese people are trying to abandon their own language”. Her boyfriend wants to “stop this wretched proliferation of katakana”.But stopping it is not easy, and probably not possible. Qudan explains that while older generations sometimes choose katakana over kanji, or vice versa, for younger generations like her – Qudan was born in 1990 – katakana “has become a standard which is not questioned”.This is not merely an academic or cultural detail, but an urgent issue for Japan’s politics today. In Japanese elections last month, the far-right party Sanseitosurged in support, winning 14 seats in the upper house of parliament, where it had previously held only one. The party campaigns on a slogan that translates as “Japanese people first”, echoing Donald Trump and Maga’s “America first”. Its success has raised fears of an anti-foreigner backlash. Is diversity valued in Japan?“Unfortunately,” Qudan says, “the reality is that not all Japanese people welcome diversity. Twelve years ago, I had a foreign, non-Japanese boyfriend, and I introduced him to my parents. My mother was extremely unhappy. She panicked. It might have been the biggest shock in my entire life to see my own mother react in this way. I’d never thought of her as someone who discriminated against foreigners.‘Marriage feels like a hostage situation, and motherhood a curse’: Japanese author Sayaka MurataRead more“There are people all around you who you would never think hold those views, who actually do hold those views. A lot of Japanese people, on the surface, they know how to act in a way that makes them seem [welcoming of diversity]. And this discrepancy between what people think on the inside and what they say is a very distinctive feature.”This brings us back to language, and how it can both conceal and reveal. In its “Japanese people first” slogan, Qudan explains, the Sanseito party uses the katakana word for “first”, rather than the traditional Japanese kanji word. “By using the katakana equivalent,” Qudan says, “a lot of the negative associations can be replaced by neutral ones. It doesn’t trigger people in the same way.”It creates, in other words, a sort of plausible deniability? “Yes, yes. They know exactly what they’re doing. And that’s why this use of katakana requires our attention,” Qudan concludes. “When someone uses katakana, we should ask: what are they trying to hide?”Sympathy Tower Tokyo by Rie Qudan is published on 21 August (Penguin Books, £10.99).

Where can the Terminator franchise go from here?Ben ChildHe complains tech is moving faster than he can write a script, but the director who invented machines thinking for themselves is still more creative than themMon 18 Aug 2025 10.19 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 13.10 EDTShareJames Cameron has a confession: he can’t write Terminator 7. And it’s not because Hollywood won’t let him, as he’s too busy making the new Avatar – it’s because reality keeps nicking his plotlines. “I’m at a point right now where I have a hard time writing science-fiction,”Cameron told CNN this week. “I’m tasked with writing a new Terminator story [but] I don’t know what to say that won’t be overtaken by real events. We are living in a science-fiction age right now.”It’s an understandable quandary for the veteran film-maker. Back in 1984, when the first Terminator movie came out, there was genuine shock value in the idea of a killer robot travelling through time from a future in which the wretched dregs of humanity survive in a chrome-plated hellscape dominated by their robot overlords. These days, the only far-fetched part of the movie is the bit where the T-800 turns up alone and completely naked, as opposed to arriving flanked by a swarm of AI-guided drones.We may not have achieved time travel just yet, but we do haveartificial intelligences capable of quietly teaching themselves sarcasm,city-wide facial recognition, androbot learning systems deciding who lives and dies. That’s the heart of Cameron’s problem: in 1984, Skynet was a terrifying piece of speculative fiction. In 2025, it’s basically LinkedIn with nukes. The creeping dread of AI isn’t a future shock any more; it’s the news cycle. From AI-powered spyware in our pockets to deepfake scams and voice-mimicking chatbots, the Terminator franchise no longer has the monopoly on making you want to hurl your hi-tech personal possessions into the sea.Cameron seems to be caught between a rock and a hard place here, especially as this grand old sci-fi saga hasn’t exactly been blowing anyone’s CPU in well … decades.Terminator: Dark Fate, which the saga’s creator at least had a basic hand in developing, struggled at the 2019 box office despite the return of Linda Hamilton and a storyline that tried to mix the franchise’s classic “unstoppable hunter” formula with a reunion tour for its surviving stars. Before that, we have to go all the way back to 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day to find a film that audiences really warmed to. The wilderness years between those two movies were littered with sequels that were too bleak, or too daft.View image in fullscreenClassic formula … Linda Hamilton in 2019’s Terminator: Dark Fate.Photograph: Kerry Brown/20th Century Fox/Paramount Pictures/AllstarWhat Cameron should be looking for is a complete system reboot to reinvigorate the saga in the wayPreybrought fans back to Predator andAlien: Romulusrestored interest in slimy Xenomorphs. All evidence suggests that the 70-year-old film-maker isfar more interested in the current challenges surrounding AI, superintelligences and humankind’s constant efforts to destroy itself, which doesn’t exactly lend itself to the sort of back-to-basics, relentless-monsters-hunt-a-few-unlucky-humans-for-two-hours approach that has worked elsewhere. The challenge here seems to be to fuse Terminator’s core DNA – unstoppable cyborgs, explosive chase sequences, and Sarah Connor-level defiance – with the occasionally rather more prosaic yet equally scary existential anxieties of 21st-century AI doom-mongering.So we may get Terminator 7: Kill List, in which a single, battered freedom fighter is hunted across a decimated city by a T-800 running a predictive policing algorithm that knows her next move before she does. Or T7: Singularity’s Mom, in which a lone Sarah Connor-type must protect a teenage coder whose chatbot will one day evolve into Skynet. Or Terminator 7: Terms and Conditions, in which humanity’s downfall comes not from nuclear warfare but from everyone absent-mindedly agreeing to Skynet’s new privacy policy, triggering an army of leather-clad enforcers to collect on the fine print.Or perhaps the future just looks terrifying enough without Cameron getting involved – which, rather worryingly for the future of the franchise, seems to be the director’s essential point. Then again, if anyone can make the apocalypse feel even worse than it already does, it’s the man who previously convinced us that autonomous drones would hunt humans from the sky and that machines would learn to think and kill for themselves. We should have confidence he can do it again.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekJames CameronThe TerminatorArtificial intelligence (AI)commentShareReuse this content"

It’s not that kind of music.’” Aston laughs, aware that pop musicals tend to be vehicles for colourful, uber-mainstream acts such as Queen or Abba, not veteran indie rock bands. “But I said, ‘Oh yes you can.’”Keir Starmer came to a lot of our gigs. But I’m still waiting for my invitation to Downing StreetAnd oh yes he has.Reception: A New Musicalis about to premiere in the band’s home town of Leeds. Various Covid-related delays mean its appearance now serendipitously coincides with the band’s 40th anniversary and new retrospective collection, 40. Aston, more usually associated with theatrical productions such asIvory’s RAF play Bomber’s Moon, insists he would never have done it without Gedge, the show’s creative consultant. However, the singer says that when Aston first approached him in 2020, he was “astounded”.Gedge, speaking by video call from his Brighton home, says: “I told him, ‘I don’t know anything about musicals – and I’m not even sure I like them!’ But he explained that my lyrics are like dialogue, which he could link together in a storyline. Then the pandemic happened and I was half expecting to never hear from him again. A year ago, he called and said, ‘I’ve written it. I’m starting auditioning and then rehearsals. Can you come along?’”View image in fullscreenUps, downs and breakups … rehearsals for Reception: A New Musical.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Northedge PhotographyReception isn’t a biographical musical. It’s an emotionally charged story about friends who meet at the University of Leeds and subsequently go through ups, downs and breakups. When I sit in on rehearsals, I instantly pick up on Gedge’s impassioned lyrics. Lines such as “I just decided I don’t trust you any more”, from the 1990 hit Brassneck, are delivered by characters in emotionally appropriate situations, experiencing love, betrayal, loss, you name it. Meanwhile, actor-musicians nail that head-rushing Wedding Present sound, something the singer sums up as “the Velvet Underground – but faster”.The Wedding Present have been York-based Aston’s favourite band ever since he saw them at Confettis nightclub in Derby on 20 October 1988. They were one of the foremost British indie rock bands of the late 80s and 90s, successors to the Smiths. “I was 15 and really small,” he grins during a lunchbreak. “Everyone had to huddle around me to sneak me in. But the noise, the lights, the surge forward, beer going everywhere, balloons coming down from the ceiling … I got a nosebleed within minutes, but I was blown away.” Since that day, he has seen the Wedding Present and Cinerama “60 or 70” times.Like the characters in Reception, the band came together in and around Leeds uni. Born in the town’s Bramley area, maths student Gedge was the first of his extended working-class family to go into higher education. “So,” he says, “when I packed it in and said, ‘I’m gonna be famous’, they were appalled. I stopped going home because we’d have arguments all the time. But they had instilled a work ethic. I was very driven.”Gedge describes how the band sat individually cutting and glueing the sleeves for 500 copies of their first single, Go Out and Get ’Em Boy!, released on their Reception label for £500. When John Peel played it on Radio 1, the singer was so excited he ran all the way to bassist Keith Gregory’s house to shout: “Have you got the radio on?” As Gedge recalls: “Peel played it 10 times. At that point, my life changed.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve seen them 60 or 70 times’ ... writer, director and fan Matt Aston at rehearsals.Photograph: Ed Sykes/Northedge PhotographyAlthough 1987 debut album George Best and 1989’s Bizarro exemplify the band’s inimitable, classic sound, Gedge insists the musical fits in with “the Wedding Present tradition of going off at weird tangents”. Indeed. George Best was an indie No 1, making them such hot property that they signed to major label RCA for “the sort of deal normally given to people like Annie Lennox”. And then their next release for their new label was an album of Ukrainian folk songs, instigated by guitarist Peter Solowka (who later formed the Ukrainians).In 1991, as the music world went baggy, the “Weddoes” listened to US alt-rock and made the slower, darker album Seamonsters with “a maverick engineer no one had heard of”. This was Steve Albini, who subsequently produced Nirvana. “We literally lost half our fans,” Gedge admits. “But now they all think it’s one of our best albums.”In 1992, they released a single every month. “That was such a great idea that we had it all planned within 15 minutes,” the singer laughs. “All seven-inch singles, cover versions on the B-side, matching sleeves. To RCA’s credit, they said OK.” All of which paid off when the band equalled Elvis Presley’s record of 12 UK Top 40 hits in one year.I’ve just written songs – I’m not a doctor who saved livesDavid GedgeThere have also been some lyrical curveballs: 1987’s All About Eve reflected on the year Gedge spent in apartheid South Africa as a child, while 1989’s Kennedy dwelt on conspiracy theories. But Gedge insists that the overwhelming majority of his 300-plus songs are about relationships, meaning they’re well-suited for drama.His early lyrics are particularly raw. The 2018 documentary Something Left Behind suggested they were all triggered by being dumped by his first love, but Gedge says otherwise. “Jaz was my first proper girlfriend. She chucked me and went off with someone else, but after her there was Alexandra, then Sally.” He says a lot of the lyrics – such as those to My Favourite Dress (“a drunken kiss, a stranger’s hand on my favourite dress”) – were drawn from real life. “But that wasn’t Jaz, that was Alexandra.”For Aston, such songs capture “those moments we all have where someone is the centre of your world, then your world ends and that kind of defines you”. To this day, Wedding Present gigs are full of men (and some women) of a certain age, singing Gedge’s words, occasionally tearfully. “A psychologist once explained that men of my generation didn’t talk about emotions,” says the singer, “so they come up and thank me for getting them through their divorce or whatever with the songs. It’s flattering – but I just write songs. I’m not a doctor who saved their life.”View image in fullscreen‘It features me without me. It’s clever, really’ … Gedge, right, with the band in the 1990s.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesOne fan is Keir Starmer. In 2023, the PM – who studied law in Leeds – revealed that My Favourite Dress, which is beautifully reimagined in Reception as a piano ballad, is one of his favourite songs. “David,” Starmer explained, “managed to perfectly distil the tortuous agonising feelings of jealousy into three minutes of angst.”“He came to a lot of our early gigs,” Gedge reveals. “I don’t remember him because there were loads of lads and girls, but he was a mate of a mate of Keith’s and I’m told I have hung out with him.” The singer smiles broadly. “But I’m still waiting for my invitation to Downing Street, like Noel Gallagher got from Tony Blair.”Now 65, Gedge carries his “indie rock god” status lightly. When Aston first met him properly, after years of “mumbled hellos at the merchandise stall”, he found someone he could work with – and whose presence looms over Reception. “There are many not-so-subtle references in the script,” the writer-director laughs. “All the character names are from the songs. The lead character spends a year in Seattle, which David did, although we moved the couple in My Favourite Dress from Manchester to Brighton. So there’s a bit of me in there and a lot of him.”For Gedge, Reception is “a fictional story but it kind of features me without me. Which is clever, really.” Aston knows the project is quite a departure but says: “I wouldn’t take the risk for myself or David if I thought it wouldn’t work. It’s a love letter to the band – a thank you for the last 40 years.”Reception: A New Musicalis at The Warehouse in Holbeck (Slung Low), Leeds, from 22 August to 6 September.

It stuck in my head as the ultimate horror film – it terrified the daylights out of me. Terence’s greatest beauties were his eyes – in some of the early films you don’t see it, but in person, when they were shining, he could hold a room. He’d sit there and say, “Watch this, I’m going to stop a restaurant.” And he could do it. I saw him do it! It was extraordinary. He once told me that he used to have real fun on Superman when he was bored, stuck on top of the ice castle. “I’d just stare down until everyone went quiet,” he said.We tried many actors when casting Bernadette inThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but absolutely everybody turned the role down. Terence was easily on the top of our list, but we thought he’d never do it. The honest truth is, he turned it down at first. But out of nowhere, his agent said to him, “Well, you’re bored. You’ve just done superhero movies. Why don’t you do something else?” It was astonishing when his agent reached out and said, “No, he wants to talk.” We were falling over ourselves. If he wanted the role, it was his.Terence Stamp: the mesmerisingly seductive dark prince of British cinemaRead moreWe talked long and hard about why he’d initially said no. It was fear. And fair enough – you have got to remember we were coming out of the HIV/Aids mess. It was a taboo subject. I looked at the work that he’d done all the way through, like the Italian years when he worked with Fellini and Pasolini, and thought: this was a man who took chances. And I think he was at absolutely the right moment in his life where he was ready for another chance.View image in fullscreenGuy Pearce, Terence Stamp and Hugo Weaving in 1994’s The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyTerence admitted he was absolutely terrified to play Bernadette – he was being voted one of the best-looking men on earth and suddenly in Priscilla he was, and this is a direct quote, “dressed up as an old dog”. But he put the pain of what he was going through into the performance, and that’s what made the film.In my head, I had a very clear idea of who Bernadette was. I remember looking at Terence when he came out presented as Bernadette for the first time. I said, “Well this isn’t what I pictured in my head, but it’s interesting. Let’s talk about it.” Meanwhile, Terence looked at the mirror and completely exploded. From that point in the film, no mirrors were allowed. It was the fear. But he worked it in – he knew what he was doing. Every day, they’d say, “You want to see rushes?” And he’d say, “No. If I’m committing, I’m going for it.”View image in fullscreenTerence Stamp and Julie Christie in Far From the Madding Crowd.Photograph: Vic/Appia/Rex/ShutterstockBy the time we finished the shoot, he was way past being afraid and Priscilla was a real high point for him. Over the years, we became very close. He was a loner, but we became really good pals. Anytime I was anywhere near him, I would visit. Once you got through the layers, he was an East End boy, a working-class boy, and I think over the years, the thing I most loved was that he let me into that world. And sometimes it was very foul-mouthed!Terence would complain that he was only ever asked about two things: Priscilla or Superman. The amount of times he said to me, “Far From the Madding Crowd [1967] – I’ve never worked so hard at something so magnificent and it has been forgotten.” I said, “It’s called time, Terence.” He said, “But Priscilla is 30 years old. Why doesn’t it go away? They only ask me about two films, and one of them’s fucking Priscilla.” And I’d get the giggles. That’s when we began talking about a Priscilla sequel. On that front, let’s just say – he agreed to do the sequel a few years ago and we’ve been particularly busy over the past year.By the end of his career, he was working to keep himself entertained. He was discerning – if he’d already seen something like it, he didn’t care. If something pressed his buttons and piqued his interest, he’d consider it. His Italian years were just breathtaking. Who the hell gets to work with all those people? He said to me, “I just drifted from one to the other – if somebody had something interesting, I’d do it. That’s the way it’s always been.”Terence kept to himself. He was an enigma. And then he’d show up, use the eyes and turn everybody to jelly. He was a wonderful man – and he’s not done yet.Stephan Elliott is a film-maker and director of The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.Explore more on these topicsTerence StampAustralian filmThe Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the DesertfeaturesShareReuse this content"

One who made me smile is Alex O’Neill in Dublin company CoisCéim Dance Theatre’sDancehall Blues. He’s the highlight of an underpowered piece of dance theatre, a duet set in a (somewhat apocalyptic) society in crisis, about rediscovering the importance of human connection. O’Neill brings the material to life with character and charm, pouncing on the steps, his movement muscular and vernacular, with sensitivity and bite.Her show has already ended, but Sarah Aviaja Hammeken is absolutely one to watch out for in the future, an award-winning Danish dancer/choreographer whose soloSoilis about her Greenlandic heritage. The work felt like it could be further developed, but every time Hammeken danced I was engrossed in the instinctive expressiveness and gravity of her movement, the feeling of someone working things out, physically and mentally, a fluent conversation between mind and body.Solitude Without Loneliness review – bad dates, frenzied flyering and the spirit of the fringeRead moreKennedy Junior Muntanga is another utterly compelling mover, a dancer of immense, intense power and finesse, but one who seems almost resistant to give us what he’s good at. In his experimental soloAkropolis I, there’s even a line where he seemingly admonishes himself under his breath: “Just dance!” Akropolis I was a late addition to the fringe and shows Muntanga still struggling with what he wants to say and how, but he’ll be well worth seeing when he works it out.Honourable mention for an acrobat who is also clearly a great dancer with a distinctive physical style: Ange Viaud from new company Copenhagen Collective, who debutedThe Genesis, a large-scale acrobatics show in the mode of festival favesCircaorGravity and Other Myths(the show is three-star good with tons of potential). Viaud shows precision gymnastic prowess and b-boy flair, but also has a wildness about him, as if anything could happen next.View image in fullscreenCheeky and entertaining … Sixº by Flip Fabrique.Photograph: Cédric MéravillesFrom the sample of shows I dipped into this year, it’s hard to spot trends across the dance (and circus/physical theatre) programme, except perhaps a sense of mild disappointment and the feeling no one’s had quite enough rehearsal time to develop their ideas. Often shows are frustrating because you can see there’s some great talent or material there but it’s just not working. Case in point, Canadian company We All Fall Down, whose last fringe show,Papillon, was very well regarded. They returned this year with something much more personal.Because You Never Askedis based on a recording of co-director Roger White talking to his Jewish grandmother, who escaped from Germany in 1939, to Edinburgh. The stories of growing up amid the rise of nazism, of Hitler visiting Hamburg, of friends being taken from their homes, have huge inbuilt power that is completely drowned out at times by a soundtrack that competes in frequency, and the distraction of dance that seems wilfully at odds with the text. The music has a thriller-ish tone of percussive booms and nerves-on-edge strings that is entirely unnecessary – we all know the underlying horror. It’s a bombardment that undermines the strength of the source material.Elsewhere, some underwhelming circus-theatre from Quebec’s Flip Fabrique inSix°. Contrary to the current vogue for stripped-back circus, this one comes with a theatrical setting and quirky characters. What that setting is and who those characters are isn’t totally clear, and there’s a moral brewing but the big reveal never really comes. Nevertheless, it’s genial entertainment with some cheeky acrobats prone to silly dancing.In the Bushes review – a fun and fearful walk on the wild sideRead moreAlso a little underwhelming, homegrown company BarrowlandBalletaddressed the topic of the moment, masculinity, inWee Man, particularly as it applies to teenage boys – there were four of them in this production and very good they were, too. The show felt a bit like it was in its workshop stages and while it was very warm and well-meaning, there was nothing too surprising in the ideas offered about what it supposedly takes to be a man, even if the quotes no doubt come from real life: don’t cry; if you can’t be popular, be funny; be strong, be right, be aggressive. Having said that, there were a couple of Scottish references that raised a laugh: “Always walk as if you’re wearing a sporran full of porridge”, and the rule of summer, apt for the heatwave outside – “When it hits 16 degrees, taps aff!”View image in fullscreenHot topic … Barrowland Ballet’s Wee Man.Photograph: Viktoria BeggStill, there were surprise finds at the festival, too. Like a sweet kids show from Revel PuckCircus,TheUgly Duckling, all about embracing your differences, which has a lot of knowing lines for the adults, too. Then the two-handerGo!from company Corps In Situ, a martial arts duet that’s beautifully choreographic in its sense of rhythm, pace, attack and grace. The performers have absolute physical command and focus but there’s playfulness and humour, too. It’s a short (40-minute) show that’s skilful and satisfying.Scoring high for likability factor is TS Crew from Hong Kong, who inNo Sugar No Milkcombined hip-hop, beatbox, martial arts, circus and a lot of physical humour in silly skits, set in a Hong Kong cafe. The high jinks of the slightly hapless staff involved low-stakes antics like running scared from a toy mouse and artfully chucking packing boxes around.Mary, Queen of Scots review – bold ballet brings the royal courts bang up to dateRead moreFinally, gently transporting us away from the chaos of Edinburgh’s rammed streets is Mele Broomes’s daydreamyThrough Warm Temperatures, part of the Made in Scotland showcase. (Even local artists can barely afford to perform at the festival these days without being part of an official showcase, and the dance and circus programmes are dominated by international groups.) The piece is like a hypnotic ritual, the company of dancers/singers led by Broomes bathed in low light in shades of purple, magenta and blue. Cellist/composer Simone Seales sits at the back of the stage looping riffs to set up a lulling vibe; dancers’ feet pad side to side in a repetitive sway; there’s a shoulder massage, the sheen of castor oil on the performers’ skin catching the light. A voice intones: “I search inside myself to forgive myself … no shame.” It’s a ritual for healing and self-acceptance, and a world I wanted to be absorbed inside.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsDancehall Blues is atAssembly @ Dance Baseuntil 24 August.

What could a good review do for her? Briefly boost her ego, yes; shift a few seats, perhaps; make some more noise amid the festival cacophony, for sure. But would it have any value beyond that? She cannot live on acclaim.Maxwell speaks from experience. Hers was the show that went from flop to phenomenon in 2023 afterPhoebe Waller-Bridgesaw it as part of an audience of two. But the subsequent fringe success for Nan, Me and Barbara Pravi did not translate to bumper sales year round. Nor did Maxwell particularly want it to.Cancelling shows leads to existential despair and she does not want that, but what the performer likes best is to connect with small groups in intimate spaces. Should it not be possible, she wonders, to do her job without going to either extreme of hype or obscurity?But if she were to devise a formula for success, what would it look like? Hence, Babyfleareindeerbag – its name a reference to Waller-Bridge’s breakout hit Fleabag and Richard Gadd’sfringe-to-Netflix drama Baby Reindeer.

Armed with an overhead projector and a stack of acetate sheets, he is our “edutainment tutor”, devoted to an anti-Gradgrindenterprise of spreading joy through facts. Today’s lesson plan: rising sea levels, youth clubs and, er, vampire bunnies. Today’s methods: limericks, songs, plinky-plonk music and lots of doodles, some done live. Audience contributions will be rewarded with badges.View image in fullscreenAlways appealing … Scott Turnbull Presents …Surreally Good.Photograph: Mel ButlerThe result is considerably more “tainment” than “edu” as a family saga is conjured as a backstory. Pottering amiably among us, Turnbull combines our session with the proud yet recently turbulent history of the Tees Valley Projector Club, whose presidency has passed to Scott after his father’s recent death. There are sketches of his ancestors, including the great-great-grandmother whose (fully detachable) hand was sought by Beethoven and Brian “brother of Lord” Byron. A tale of pioneering lesbian scientists in a sea cave is followed by a portrait of a man with a leaf moustache, in turn followed by a Sonic Youth-referencing tale of a rabbit relocating from Los Angeles to Turnbull’s home of Stockton-on-Tees. And there are adverts for cigarettes. Made for babies.This makes a sometimes scattershot DIY hour, with a few misses among the hits, although the lines of Turnbull’s art are always appealing. The bunny opus is over-extended while the plot about his business’s takeover by a lugubriously voiced boss who threatens to shut down the show could use a slightly stronger conclusion. But it’s a lot of fun and our host has a lovely gentle presence, his childlike passion for art and storytelling accentuating the heartfelt tribute to his mum and dad. The final sequence is a tenderly rendered, wondrous folktale that would make a surreally superb sequel.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalIllustrationDesignreviewsShareReuse this content"

The better to suggest rough brickwork, Caroff scuffed the lettering, then added fire escapes and perching balletic dancers.Adapting the font to suit the material became a trademark. Other key examples include his poster for Manhattan (1979), one of more than a dozen collaborations withWoody Allen. In that image, Caroff assembled silhouettes of recognisable New York skyscrapers, including the Empire State Building, Chrysler building and the twin towers to spell out the word “Manhattan”.The second task assigned to Caroff by Chasman was to design a letterhead for the publicity release for the first Bond film, Dr No, in 1962.“He said, ‘I need a little decorative thing on top,’” Caroffrecalledin 2021. “I knew [Bond’s] designation was 007, and when I wrote the stem of the seven, I thought, ‘That looks like the handle of a gun to me.’ It was very spontaneous, no effort, it was an instant piece of creativity.”View image in fullscreenCaroff’s 1961 poster for West Side Story.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyTaking inspiration from Ian Fleming’s favourite gun, a Walther PPK, Caroff extended the image with a barrel and trigger and was paid $300 – a fee never increased by any residuals or royalties.As with much of his work, the logo was also uncredited, and Caroff never received the public acclaim or name recognition of his close contemporary, Saul Bass.Other key posters included Sergio Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and For a Few Dollars More (1965), as well as Last Tango in Paris (1972), Rollerball (1975), An Unmarried Woman (1978) and Gandhi (1982).As well as working on graphics and posters, Caroff created a number of opening title sequences, including those for Richard Attenborough’s A Bridge Too Far (1977), Volker Schlöndorff’s Death of a Salesman (1985), andMartin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ (1988).He sought above all else “effervescence” in his work, he said in the 2022TCMdocumentaryBy Design: The Joe Caroff Story. “I want it to have a life, it doesn’t want to lie there flat.”Explore more on these topicsJames BondDesignPostersGraphic designAdvertisingWoody AllenManhattannewsShareReuse this content"

His son, Jonah, later called her actions “immature” and said they were to blame for the film’s poor reviews.Gadot is Israeli andreportedly began to receive an increased number of death threatsin the aftermath of Zegler’s post, with Disney upping her security as a result.As reported bythe Jerusalem Post, Gadot said she “really enjoyed filming” Snow White during an appearance on Israeli TV show The A Talks, adding she had “even enjoyed working with Rachel Zegler”.Gadot said she had been “sure this movie was going to be a huge success”, but “then October 7 happened” and there was “a lot of pressure” on celebrities in Hollywood “to speak out against Israel”.The actor went on to say she was “disappointed” the film was “greatly affected” by such pressure and “didn’t do well” at the box office as a result.Marc Webb’s live action remake had already been dogged by negative buzz over issues including uncertainty about their approach to the dwarves. Speaking in 2022, the actorPeter Dinklage called the film “fucking backwards”.“I was a little taken aback by [the fact] they were very proud to cast a Latina actress as Snow White,” Dinklage told podcaster Marc Maron, “but you’re still telling the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.The film, whose production budget was an estimated $270m, ended up taking around $205m worldwide – a disappointing but not catastrophic result. Reviews, however, were almost universally negative, with theGuardian’s Peter Bradshaw calling it “exhausting awful”.Gadot served as a combat fitness instructor in the IDF army for two years, including during the Israel-Lebanon war of 2006.Speaking in 2024, Gadot spoke at the Anti-Defamation League’s summit, saying: “Never did I imagine that on the streets of the United States, and different cities around the world, we would see people not condemning Hamas, but celebrating, justifying and cheering on a massacre of Jews.”Explore more on these topicsFilmSnow WhiteWalt Disney CompanyIsraelPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was worth the waitEllen E JonesMon 18 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 00.02 EDTShareIt’s taken nearly 20 years for the American reality franchise to wind its way across the Atlantic to the capital. In the meantime, there were pretenders and near-misses –Ladies of London,Real Housewives of Cheshire– but now, finally, west London’s ex-model community has a viable retirement plan.The delay seems all the more inexplicable, when you consider how to the manner born – if not to themanorborn – these ladies are. Take Amanda, who lives in Belgravia, drives a Bentley convertible, runs an underperforming luxury beauty brand and is in a co-dependent relationship with her poodle-cum-stylist, Monty. Amanda has it all –clearly– and in the first episode’s first five minutes, she cements her status as RHOL’s Queen Bee by saying: “I’m actually a really private person.” Direct to camera. On a reality TV show. With a straight face. Nowthat’sa Real Housewife.It’s all about being “real”, you see – in the sense of being fake, but in areallycommitted way. The “house” bit also matters. Hence, we’re introduced to every cast member with a property-porn interiors montage (a slow-pan of the walk-in bag/shoe closet is the obligatory third or fourth shot). To a lesser extent, the “wife” bit is also important. That’s why, and no offence to the one from Wham who’s not George Michael, but Amanda is going to need to accrue some more impressive ex-husbands if she hopes to secure her top spot for many more series to come. I’m rooting for you, babe. We’re all rooting for you.All except RHOL’s five other cast members. They’re not rooting for you, Amanda. They’re perfectly poised to snatch the crown, should it ever slip. And, as befits a city full of history, some of these society girls go back.Wayback. Like, all the way back to “when Annabel’s first opened”, which should lend a certain “heritage” texture to their feuding.There are two Juliets, at least one of whom rides horses in Hyde Park and has a husband named Tiggy. Indeed, with such aristo bona fides, one might think it unnecessary to further signpost your status ambitions by dressing up for the confessional in a royal insignia and ruffs, like a Poundland Elizabeth I. But perhaps this was done for the benefit of Juliet M’s nemesis, Panthea, whose husband, a lowly lawyer, has recently been made “Master of the Solicitors” as a “prestige thing” (never heard of it).In London, we’re told, “wealth whispers”. That’s in contrast to the outrageous overconsumption of OG Real Housewives like Teresa Giudice and Jen Shah – both convicted fraudsters – from the New Jersey and Salt Lake City shows, respectively. In practice, it’s investment banker turned baker Nessie wiggling her eyebrows suggestively, while saying things like “We were in a very …comfortableposition, let’s say”. Or describing her husband’s line of work as “entrepreneur in the mining industry”, which is certainly one of the more transparent euphemisms for “earthly emissary from hell’s 9th circle” that I’ve heard lately.None of this rises to the level of the class analysis or psychological insight that we’ve come to expect from the franchise at its finest, but happily there’s still time for deeper themes to develop. And happily there’s also Karen, from Jamaica via Jersey, whose main function on the show is cracking up at the foolishness of these Englishwomen, while delivering teeth-kissing side-eye, as only a posh Jamaican can.View image in fullscreen‘It will be carnage in there’ … Amanda Cronin.Photograph: PRWith chaos agents like these on the guest-list, Amanda is quite right to brace for trouble ahead of her International Women’s Day soiree: “This loo needs to be checked every 15 minutes,” she tells her housekeeper sternly. “Remember. Because it will becarnagein there.” Ominous … But maybe Beluga caviar has some digestive side-effects which are well-known in society circles? Or is it the Ozempic?In the event, RHOL’s inaugural bust-up happens outside the downstairs loo, after Panthea made a toast that was 10% empty girl boss platitudes and 90% shady digs at Juliet.God bless Panthea, the only one vulgar enough to break that “wealth whispers” omertà and put a price-tag on her bragging. She once dropped a cool £140,000 in a single Harrods trip, she says, which “back then is equivalent to 300-and-something thousand”. I’ve done the maths, and this dates Panthea’s spree to some point in 1963 – around the same time private members’ club Annabel’s opened, in fact. So either they’re all time-travelling vampires, let loose on one of Nessie’s husband’s Hellmouth expeditions or – good news, girls – the botox really works!The Real Housewives of London is on Hayu.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

A reboot – Home to Roost – was announced back in 2022 and the cameras followed the gang again for three years. But Ozzy’s health continued to decline and, just days after a defiant final homecoming concert with Black Sabbath last month, the Prince of Darkness died aged 76. The footage has been reworked as a one-hour documentary and is a special ode to the last chapter in the icon’s life, as he moves back to England with the family, battles illness and readies for a performance that will go down in history as the greatest goodbye in rock’n’roll.Hollie RichardsonMatthew Perry: A Hollywood Tragedy9pm, ITV1This documentary – updated since it aired in the US earlier this year – has the latest details in the case of the Friends actor’s death by ketamine overdose (five people have been charged in connection: three have pleaded guilty; two deny all allegations). It only scratches the surface of telling Perry’s story before the tragedy, but his onscreen mother, Morgan Fairchild, shares her memories, while the Hollywood Reporter’s Deborah Walker paints a picture of the world of fame in which he struggled.HRFake Or Fortune?8pm, BBC OneIf you’ve ever wished that Antiques Roadshow was 500% more stressful, Fiona Bruce’s other gig might appeal.

Then she grew up and began researching child sex trafficking, slowly piecing together clues about her own lifeMon 18 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 18 Aug 2025 09.42 EDTShareKate Price is now an academic, but it was at six that she conducted her first piece of research, leaning into the cab of her father’s truck and pressing the side button of his CB radio, the black plastic hot from the sun. She spoke the name she’d heard into it, “Chicken Plucker”, and a man’s voice replied. It was her first proof that the name she’d somehow associated with being taken from her bed in the middle of the night was attached to a real person, and that perhaps he would have answers. Then her father caught her and she was too terrified to try to contact him again.Five decades on, Price has written This Happened To Me, a memoir that reads, in part, like a detective story, piecing together clues to create a picture of the horror that had been done to her as a child, as well as her path to healing. When we speak over Zoom, Price is in her office at Wellesley College, the women’s college in Massachusetts, where she researches commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) – a world away from the rural Pennsylvania town where she grew up. For as long as she can remember, Price was sexually abused by her father until she was about 12, and he left the family. What she didn’t discover until she was an adult was that he had also been drugging her and, in the middle of the night, “selling” her to men.The book, she says, “really poured out of me”. If it was difficult to write about an almost unimaginable crime, she points out this is what she does as a career. “I research child sex trafficking. I haven’t been trafficked in about 40 years – not to say that I’m healed completely, but this is a subject matter [I work on] all of the time.”Price is also used to talking about her own experience as part of her work, and has had decades of therapy, including taking part in the pioneering trauma treatment by thepsychiatrist Bessel van der Kolkin the early 90s; Kolk included Price as a case study inhis bestselling book The Body Keeps the Score. He was the one who first told her that her PTSD would be a lifelong condition to manage, and she does, with therapy, exercise, sleep and nutrition, as well as a steady, loving marriage. “I’m lucky to have the resources,” she says. “It’s a ton of privilege that goes into it.”Much of Price’s book is based on the decade-long investigation she worked on with the journalist Janelle Nanos, which became a 2022 piece for the Boston Globe. “In the same way that I was able to thrive in school, I could compartmentalise, thinking this is a research project. Yes, it’s my life, but …” She doesn’t finish the thought. “I would say, actually, it was incredibly healing. My sister and I had these incredible conversations that we’d never had, that started when I was working on the article, but continued as I was working on the book. That was happy emotion, quite the opposite of this gut-wrenching stuff.”Growing up, Price witnessed the violence of their father against her older sister. Her sister, who was constantly compared unfavourably to Price, appeared to hate her. In the course of her research, Price would find out her sister had also been trafficked by their father. Price also endured their father’s physical violence; she remembers being four and hiding in cupboards when he came home from his job as an electrician, wishing it would open into Narnia, before being beaten by him. When she was six, in a rage, he carved an X on her arm with his penknife, telling her she belonged to him, then threw her down the stairs into the basement.“I knew something was wrong,” she says, but adds that she had no understanding or other frame of reference to know this was not normal. But her world started to open up: at the birthday party of a friend from her swimming team, Price discovered a home filled with books and art, where the family seemed to like one another and the children were treated with respect. “To even know that a family could be happy,” she marvels. Price vowed that one day she would create that life for herself, and she was smart enough to know that, for her, it would come through education.The abuse continued until Price was 12 and their father left the family for a young woman he had started an affair with. As a teenager, Price took an overdose of pills (antibiotics, it turned out, so they didn’t harm her). She was desperately unhappy, unsure why she couldn’t form close relationships or make good choices in boyfriends (one was emotionally and sexually abusive). As an older teen, driving past an adult cinema and rest area by the interstate, Price would tense up but not know why. “I was just so focused on going to college, on getting out of there. Even as I had these responses, it was like, push it away, I’ll deal with that later. Our brains are hardwired for survival and that was very much me.”Price did get away, collecting degrees (she would get a doctorate for her research on the criminalisation of child sex trafficking victims) while supporting herself with admin jobs and working in bookshops. She was living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and working as an assistant to the dean at Radcliffe, the Harvard women’s college, when she started seeing a therapist. Her mother had recently died, and she was grieving, but she was also unhappy and lonely, unable to make friends and living in an intellectual city that seemed alien to her rural childhood. She was also aware that her trauma went deeper. The therapist, worried she wasn’t making much progress, referred Price to Van der Kolk.During one of their sessions, Price told him her father had sexually abused her, the first time she had told anyone. What was it like to finally tell someone? “Honestly, for me it was such a relief to have an older man in my life who I trusted. I had never had that before.” This, along with being more settled at work and studying, and her father now living hundreds of miles away in Florida, meant she felt more secure than ever. “I was creating my own life, then it was like [my brain said], OK, you’re safe, you’re ready to feel the full brunt of all of this.”View image in fullscreenKate Price and her cat at the back door of her home, 1976.Photograph: Courtesy of Kate PriceThe night that she experienced her first full flashbacks of being raped by men other than her father, at a rest area by the interstate, she had to go to hospital, suicidal. “This is information I had been trying to unlock, at that point, for a couple of years,” she says. “It was like seeing a slideshow, and it was about 100 perpetrators, and I can close my eyes right now and still see it, and it was absolutely overwhelming and terrifying.” She saw Van der Kolk the next day, and would do for many years. It was also the start of “learning how to be a human being”. She couldn’t feel emotions, and remembers buying cassette tapes teaching her to tap into them. “I was numb. I had been completely dehumanised by my father. He had beaten out any sense of agency or humanity in me.”One of the hardest things, she says, “that was so difficult to square, was just how purposeful it was”. That her father had drugged her, and allowed men to rape her for money. Emboldened, she called him – not quite brave enough to tell him she’d remembered she had been trafficked, but she did confront him about the sexual abuse. He exploded, and told her never to contact him again. “I was understanding the totality of everything that had happened to me, and I was finally more angry at him than I was scared,” she says. “By this time, I had been doing work for three, four years, and I just couldn’t live the lie any more.”View image in fullscreenBessel van der Kolk, the psychiatrist and PTSD specialist who helped Price to deal with her traumatic childhood.Photograph: M. Scott Brauer/The GuardianUp until that point, she still had contact with her father – there were occasional phone calls, and once she even stayed with him for several days. Although she didn’t know the full extent of his abuse, she knew he had repeatedly raped her as a child. How could she be around him? “That is Appalachia, it’s always family first. That had been ingrained in me, and I just went along with being a good girl.” She had seen it with her own mother who had been treated horribly by her family, but remained dutiful (she would also find out her mother had been sexually abused by her own father). Price, when around her father, was still in “survival mode” she says. “How to appease him, how to take the temperature of his moods.” Until the full realisation became too much. “I was sick of the falsity, and I was sick of being his puppet. I realised that I was colluding at that point – by going along with his game, that I was part of his narrative. He got to say he had talked to me or seen me, like we had this great loving relationship. Forget that, I’m done.”Price never spoke to her father again, but Nanos, the Boston Globe journalist did, in 2022 (again, he angrily denied everything). By the time Price met Nanos, and they began working together on the story, she was an influential researcher of commercial child sexual exploitation – what we used to call, appallingly, “child prostitution”, and was happily married to a renowned sports journalist, with a son.During the long years of researching that story, other family members and people who knew the family disputed Price’s experiences. “I wasn’t surprised,” she says. “I did not do the article or write this book to repair any family or former friend relationships. I feel compassion for my family, because if they were to actually acknowledge that my father had abused and trafficked me, they would have to reconcile that they’d been duped their entire lives by him. And they would also have to confront that maybe they themselves, or their children, had been sexually abused, either by my father or someone else.” She knew what had happened, but she wanted to know who else knew.Price’s second grade school photograph, 1977.Photograph: Courtesy of Kate PriceDevastatingly, Price discovered her mother had known. They had been close, and Price loved her mother. She doesn’t have answers, but the way she talks now, rationalising her mother’s decision to stay, is calm. Talking to her mother’s best friend, who revealed the truth, Price thinks her mother was terrified of losing them – either taken away as children, or through estrangement as young adults had she confessed. “As a mother, it is certainly not the choice I would make, and at the same time, I say that as a middle-class woman who has choices. My mother was an uneducated woman and trapped in an abusive relationship. So we sit at very different places.” Is she not angry with her? “Of course. She threw us to the wolves. As a non-offending family member, she was part of the collusion.”If she has reached a degree of forgiveness, or at least understanding, for her mother, extending the same to her father has not been necessary for her ongoing recovery. She found out he’d died a few months ago, and wasn’t sad. “I’m just grateful that he’s not here any longer so he can’t hurt anyone else.”Price never attempted to bring her father to justice. “When we look at the statistics, and this is not for trafficking, but child sexual abuse in the United States, less than 10% of reported perpetrators are convicted. We don’t have a culture that serves and supports survivors and victims. I knew what a defence attorney would do to me, completely rip me apart.” We need, she says, to “believe and support survivors, because that blaming and shaming of victims and survivors is empowering perpetrators to keep going”.Since the article, and now with the book, other survivors contact Price. It isn’t difficult, she’s grateful, she says. “I’m honoured that people want to share their stories with me and that people feel some sense of validation, being seen. As we know, so many survivors take their own lives.” She points to Virginia Giuffre, who was trafficked and abused by Jeffrey Epstein, anddied by suicide in April. “She was one of the most strong, outspoken survivors I’d ever seen. But then to take her own life, it sadly is a story I know all too well. So I’m grateful that I can be here, to provide research that validates other people’s experience, particularly for familial survivors who have been told by their families, like me, that they’re crazy, that they’re making this up. To be able to say, actually, here’s somebody who got the proof. This really does happen.”This Happened to Me by Kate Price (Bonnier Books, £22).

He had recently been released from prison, where he had been held after his critiques of corruption and inequality had touched a nerve among leaders of the recently independent nation. But his address provoked strong reactions for another reason: up until that moment, Ngũgĩ had been closely associated with the emergence of an African tradition of writing in English and acknowledged as a key figure in the rise of the novel as a major genre on the continent; his fictional work was often cited as an example of how English was being remade in formerly colonised societies. His early novels, from 1964’s Weep Not, Child onward, struck a chord with a global Anglophone audience partly because they echoed the English novelists he had read as a student at Makerere University College, the Ugandan branch of the University of London, and Leeds University, the seat of “Commonwealth” literary studies in the 1960s.By the time of his speech, Ngũgĩ was a member of the literary establishment in Africa, a leading figure in world literature, and a leader in postcolonial thought. And while it is true that he had challenged what he saw as the hegemony of English in a 1968 manifesto, On the Abolition of the English Department, co-written with two of his colleagues at the University of Nairobi, Ngũgĩ assumed that the abolition of English did not mean dispensing with the colonial language. In fact, for most of the 1960s and 1970s he shared a belief, common among the postcolonial elite, that a literature in the ex-coloniser’s language could indeed be revolutionary. But now the novelist had decided to break away from English, to depart, as he put it, “from Anglo-Saxon literature in order to reconnect to the patriotic traditions of a national and culture literature rooted among the people”. He would henceforth write in his mother tongue, Gĩkũyũ (known to Swahili and English speakers as Kikuyu).As I saw the big smile on Ngũgĩ’s face, it dawned on me that writing his novel in Gĩkũyũ had been a kind of homecomingIt is therefore fitting that, in Decolonizing Language, Ngũgĩ, whodied earlier this yearaged 87, should return to the question of language as effectively his final statement. The 20 essays collected in the book rehearse positions first articulated in his earlier collections, Writers in PoliticsandDecolonizing the Mind; but the new book is notable for Ngũgĩ’s attention to the dangers that mother tongues face across the world, from colonial Ireland to Sami Norway, New Zealand and beyond. Read together, the essays resonate as a manifesto for the mother tongue both as “the very heart of our being and existence” and the ultimate firewall against “spiritual domination”. The mission of Decolonizing Language, the “revolutionary idea” encapsulated in the book’s subtitle, is an incisive rejection of the notion that European “languages are inherently global and best able to carry intelligence and universality” or that they function as the languages “of power and normality”.Reading the book and reflecting on the many conversations I had with Ngũgĩ as he tried to come to terms with his exile after learning of threats against his life in 1982, I was reminded of how different the situation was in 1979, when the author made his “epistemological break” with English. I had graduated from the University of Nairobi a few months before, and had taken up a job as a trainee editor in the local office of Heinemann Educational Books, which was at the time a major publisher of African literature. My first task at Heinemann was to edit Devil on the Cross, Ngũgĩ’s first novel in Gĩkũyũ. The famous author had two demands of his young editor: he insisted that his novel be edited to the same standards as the works I was editing in English and that it be directed at common readers, not elites. I went to work on the manuscript, which he had written in prison; when it was all done, and as I sat back and watched the big smile of satisfaction on his face, it dawned on me that for Ngũgĩ writing a novel in Gĩkũyũ had been a kind of homecoming. The book’s initial reception stayed with him for many years: “It was read in groups at homes and factory grounds, on public transportation even, the literate becoming the ‘present’ author of the story,” he noted in 2010.Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: three days with a giant of African literatureRead moreNgũgĩ’s decision to break with English provoked strong reactions: it was hailed by writers and cultural activists working in African languages who had felt left out in postcolonial debates that privileged English; it was criticised by prominent African writers, includingChinua Achebe, the “founding father” of African literature, who insisted that English was a necessary linguistic tool in holding together multiethnic nations. Ngũgĩ refused to concede; instead he embarked on a global crusade defending mother tongues as indispensable tools in the decolonization of the mind. In this context, Decolonizing Language can be read as the author’s final take on the overriding theme of this critical project, a clear diagnosis of the challenges mother tongues face in a world defined by linguistic hierarchies. On a more personal level, the book is Ngũgĩ’s last account of his displacement from his own native ground, an acknowledgement of the heavy burden that those who write and speak the language of the other have to carry. The arguments made in the book are exhilarating; reading them in the author’s absence is undeniably poignant.Simon Gikandi is University Professor of English at Princeton.Decolonizing Language and Other Revolutionary Ideas by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o is published by Allen Lane (£20).

Screenwriter Alan O’Gorman and first-time director and story co-creator Brendan Canty deliver a social-realist film with heart, featuring outstanding performances of sympathy and strength, developed from Canty’s 2019 short film of the same name. It’s tough, but capable of delicacy and succeeds in conveying something very difficult to achieve without sentimentality: love of your home town. You can come for the drama and stay for the cheeky hip-hop sequence over the closing credits, a final stretch of sweetness and fun that the movie has more than earned, and which Canty, a former music video director, is more than capable of putting together.Shane (Diarmuid Noyes) is a young guy once in care, but turning his life around in Cork with wife Stacey (Emma Willis), a baby and a painting-and-decorating business. It is now Shane’s grim task to deal with his younger half-brother Christy (Danny Power), a seething, glowering 17-year-old who has just lost his place with a foster family in Ballincollig on the other side of town owing to an ugly scrap, a video of which is going viral on social media. So Shane brings him back and lets him live in his place for a while on the understanding that he will soon move back out, probably into a grim hostel.Christy finds that people around the neighbourhood remember him, as they do his late mother – but Christy himself does not remember them, having perhaps suppressed these painful childhood memories. Slowly but surely, Christy begins to fit in. It turns out that fighting isn’t all that he’s good at: he has an unlikely talent for cutting hair, which becomes the talk of the town, especially when he gives a trim to local kid Robot (a nice performance from real-life Cork rapper Jamie “the King” Forde). But he is also in danger of being drawn into the orbit of his scary criminal cousins, and Shane realises that the threat of that hostel might be driving Christy into their arms.Where another type of movie might have a gravitational pull towards disaster and despair, this one doesn’t; equally, though, it’s under no illusions. There’s always a heartbeat of humour, especially when Christy helps out with painting jobs; he and dopey fellow painter Trevor (Chris Walley) can’t resist weighing themselves on a well-off client’s hi-tech digital scales in his bathroom – synced to the client’s Fitbit, which then goes crazy. It’s a smart, likable picture.Christy screened at theEdinburgh film festival, and is out in Ireland and Northern Ireland on 29 August, and the rest of the UK on 5 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsIrelandEdinburgh film festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tony award-winning producer Jhett Tolentino at least has a good high-concept hook for his feature directorial debut: a beleaguered divorcee tries to get out of paying alimony to his ex-wife by making a fake dating profile to bag her a new partner. Sadly, this tonally shaky and borderline-sociopathic outing doesn’t have the class or skill to be part of the much-needed renaissance for the genre.Asian Persuasion takes place on the great New York dating grounds beloved of many a romcom: feckless single dad Mickey (Dante Basco, who played the leader of the Lost Boys in Steven Spielberg’s Hook) is struggling to elevate his Queens coffee shop, Da Fili Beans, to hipster notoriety. Ponying up payments to his fashion designer ex Avery (KC Concepcion) as they co-parent their daughter isn’t helping. So during a night on the lash with his wingman Caspian (Kevin Kreider), they cook up a scheme to make her someone else’s problem; preppy financial analyst Lee-Kwan (Paolo Montalban) is the man they target as their best hope.Tolentino’s attempts to court the zeitgeist are often painful, including Caspian premiering his latest TikTok dance at the coffee shop, and self-conscious dialogue apparently drawn from below-the-line on Instagram (“Can I unsubscribe from that memory?”). This extends to a strain of crassness (“We’re practically drowning in a tsunami of poon”) that makes for a rough transition to true romance, when Mickey uses his insider knowledge to knock Lee-Kwan into shape, Cyrano-style, as the ultimate seducer.So it’s not a shock when Asian Persuasion lacks the finesse required to pull off the U-turn when Mickey decides he wants Avery back. His ham-fisted sushi-bar sabotage scheme is completely unconvincing, leaving the already hard-pedalling actors looking daft. The cursory flashbacks to the couple’s disintegrating marriage first time round don’t add enough depth to make him seem much more than manipulative, or her more than an inexplicable dupe. Alternately gullible or status-obsessed, its female characters feel retrograde – even featuring a French character actually wearing a beret. The film doesn’t exactly cover itself in glory, a shame considering Tolentino’s evident zeal for promoting Asian representation.Asian Persuasion is on digital platforms from 25 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsRomance filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In Dongji Rescue, co-directed by Zhenxiang Fei and Guan Hu, this staggering tale gets a blockbuster makeover that involves Imax cameras and an $80m budget. The film opens with the stunning vista of the eponymous island, then under Japanese control. The seeds of discontent are there, as the local Chinese population are forbidden from fishing. Still, they endure the occupation with grim acceptance.Standing apart from the pack are a pair of brothers, Abi (Zhu Yilong) and Adang (Wu Lei), orphans said to descend from pirates. Their physical prowess acquires a near superhuman dimension as they are shot scaling mountainous terrain and navigating treacherous waters with dazzling speed and dexterity. When Adang comes upon a British PoW adrift at sea, his discovery and sheltering of the unfortunate man triggers an escalation of violence from the Japanese, which ultimately leads to the famed rescue mission.However, for a film that retells a stunning feat of humanity and compassion, Dongji Rescue feels oddly individualist. Zhu Yilong is charismatic as a reluctant saviour with an awakened conscience, yet the narrative insistence on a heroic figure dampens the collective potency of the actual historical event. The gory depiction of Japanese atrocities also pushes the story towards simplistic spectacle. Still, the technical finesse on display during the final section, where we see the fearless fishers coming to the aid of the PoWs, is stunning to behold. It’s a shame that such virtuosity is not reflected in the script, leaving this something of an unmoored epic in the sea of state-sponsored films released to commemorate the 80th anniversary of China’s war of resistance.Dongji Rescue is in Australian cinemas now and UK and Irish cinemas from 22 August.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsWar filmsAction and adventure filmsChinaSecond world warreviewsShareReuse this content"

Many a standup, we imagine, was once an awkward kid making people laugh to fit in – and not all of them grow out of that awkwardness. Dan Rath is a comic as uneasy in his skin as the most afflicted of classroom misfits, barely meeting our gaze as he rattles off one one-liner after another. Happily, those one-liners zing as zingily as any in town, disruptive little thoughts that flagellate Rath himself and flip the world upside down – or at least reveal it anew through the downturned eyes of a man excluded from its pleasures, and liberated from its pieties too.You could compile an entire joke-of-the-fringe list from Tropical Depression alone – although no reputable outlet could publish it without a trigger warning. Rath’s is a bleak worldview, forged in rejection, medication and alienation from the humbug of modern life. Zero per cent alcohol? Ghosting? ADHD?

Look at his joke about the ironies of Ozempic distribution, say, or the one about Rath and his brother being prescribed lithium: in both, classic joke construction marries with audacious leaps of the imagination to brilliantly animate the Aussie comic’s political and personal way of seeing. Most of his material combines embittered social alienation with scepticism of fashionable nostrums, as when he sees a “Live Love Laugh” embroidered on a cushion by an enslaved person “doing the opposite”.There’s no shape or theme to any of this. That would compromise the conceit of a fragile outpatient who seems inadvisedly to have found himself on stage: “Usually,” he deadpans, “my carer has tasered me by now.” Let us be glad they haven’t, because there’s fun to be had in the space between Rath’s painfully introverted performance style and a joke-world that’s fantastically expansive.AtMonkey Barrel, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Comedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)Edinburgh festivalreviewsShareReuse this content"

Born in Mantua around 1536, he became something of a musical propagandist for the regime, touring his ambitious choral works around Europe as a kind of composer-cum-diplomat in the hope that their acoustical magnificence would sway hearts and minds in his bosses’ favour. The pièce de résistance was his monumental Missa Sopra Ecco Sì Beato Giorno, a mass setting for 40 to 60 voices, rediscovered in 2005 having been lost for 400 years.Striggio’s mass was the centrepiece of this imaginative concert recreating the kind of liturgical event visitors to late Renaissance Florence might have been lucky enough to catch. Opening with theatrical flair, instrumentalists and singers filed on stage to a plainchant in praise of the Virgin Mary. The shift from salty medieval harmonies to the opulent warmth of Orazio Benevolo’s Laetatus Sum signalled the riches to come.View image in fullscreenHervé Niquet conducts  Le Concert Spirituel at the BBC Proms 2025.Photograph: Mark Allan/BBCLe Concert Spirituel, founded by Hervé Niquet in 1987, has form in this repertoire, having made an outstanding recording of much of this music. That said, it was surely a misstep for the musicians to perform in a closed circle on the Royal Albert Hall stage. While doubtless radio-friendly, with only a quarter of the singers facing out and another quarter presenting their backs to most of the audience, not only did balance become an issue, it was hard not to feel shut out of what should have been an immersive experience.Music in 40 parts can be exposing for individual voices. Nevertheless, the Striggio worked its magic, especially in the supersized Agnus Dei and the flamboyant Osanna in Excelsis where voices tumbled over each other with joyful abandon. Even better were the Benevolo works, including a superb Magnificat where verses were interspersed with instrumental ensembles. Palestrina motets played on sackbuts, a practice typical of the time, lent a touch of authenticity, and there were some choice rarities, including Domenico Massenzio’s frisky female-voice Filiae Jerusalem. A 40-part Striggio motet rounded off the evening with a sumptuous anticipation of paradise.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

It’s not what you’d have expected from this serious, intense, spiritually driven composer, who died earlier this year – or, to be honest, from any other composer.It opens in atmospheric, modern-classical style, ominous bells against high, tense strings. Then it explodes into funky bass guitar and brass, driving drum kit and the Star Trek-like ahhing of a close-miked vocal trio – here it was Synergy Vocals – and it’s as if the stage has been taken over by Magnum PI. Gubaidulina pits these two musics against each other, with the jazz-funk periodically dissolving into snatches of Mahlerian melody and translucent orchestral stillness – at one point a few lines of poetry are spoken on top, amid an aura of whispers from the orchestral players. Finally, there’s a slow splurge of Bond theme-ish excess – brilliantly bonkers, and the Albert Hall loved it.A quick recalibration of the ears was required for Ravel’s G major Piano Concerto,Benjamin Grosvenorthe quicksilver soloist. His playing brought out the bluesiness of Ravel’s music, especially in the slow movement, where the tender, meandering melody sounded a split-second out from the accompaniment, as if it were being delivered by a singer perched on a stool in a jazz club. Every note was clear, even as the conductorRyan Bancroftromped through ever-faster tempos in the finale – and that also went for Grosvenor’s encore, the finale of Prokofiev’s Sonata No 7, three glorious minutes of ferocious edge-of-the-seat brilliance.The second half was less crowd-pleasing, if still powerful. Shostakovich’s 1962 Symphony No 13 employs a bass-baritone soloist and men’s choir to give voice first to a harrowing response to the Holocaust massacre at Babi Yar near Kyiv and then to four other darkly subversive poems about Russia. Bancroft had the orchestra playing with pointed character, and the men of the BBC National Chorus of Wales delivered line after Russian line excellently, but for all his velvety, cavernous bass tone the Lithuanian soloistKostas Smoriginasneeded more swagger in this huge space. Perhaps the work itself travels less well than Shostakovich’s other symphonies; certainly, it was a heavy counterweight to a kaleidoscopic first half.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

The kids are wearing the khaki safari hats from the welcome packs left on their wooden bunk beds, and we are relaxing on the veranda of our hotel room, with panoramic views of the “savannah”.From this elevated position, we’re studying our neighbours on this 10-day holiday in the south of the Netherlands: Nubian giraffes, white rhinos, antelope, zebras and ostriches, all intermingling on the plain, metres in front of us. The light is fading and a heatwave is enhancing the African theme of Beekse Bergen. In the humidity, our impromptu animal quiz, aided by our in-room brochure, is halted by a low, menacing rumble.View image in fullscreenIt takes a moment for context to overtake common sense. The thunder we think we’re hearing is actually the roar from the pack of lions that live just behind our accommodation. We all fall silent, absorbing one of the primal sounds of nature.It may seem like an unusual place for a safari – close to the modest city of Tilburg and 20 miles west of industrial Eindhoven – but this is a safari holiday Netherlands-style, where you don’t have to fly to Africa to get close to our planet’s most impressive mammals.View image in fullscreenThe writer’s children in a safari hotel room.Photograph: Nazia ParveenThe 120-hectare resort is a group of interconnected sites, comprising a hotel, lodges, chalets and cottages overlooking several open plains full of wildlife; the safari park, which guests can explore on foot through a connecting gate from the resort; a lakeside resort with a beach, more lodges and a campsite for all budgets; and the Speelland theme park – with indoor and outdoor rides, slides and games.The resort hasstrong conservation credentials, with many species that are designated “vulnerable” or “extinct in the wild” protected here as part of a Europe-wide network of more than 300 zoos, aquariums and parks, including Chester Zoo in the UK. The rangers tell us that all the animals living in Beekse Bergen were born here or moved to the park from another zoo; none were taken from the wild.The Dutch have a particular, tailored approach to family holidays, designing thoughtfully for children but without compromising on aesthetic and luxurious touches for adults, and Beekse Bergen is no exception – it’s a hit with our seven-and 11-year-olds, and us parents, too. Custom-made bunk beds in one room, a picture window with views of the animals while soaking in the bath in another: attention to detail and lots to keep the kids entertained.Giraffes lick the roof of our cruiser with their giant tongues and our seven-year-old, amazed, clicks her camera over and overFor anyone staying, there is free unlimited access to the enormous safari park by car, bus or – our favourite – walking trails. Unlike a single costly trip to a regular zoo, we can make repeat visits to enjoy as many of the 100-plus animal species as we can, and at our own pace.Highlights include a magnificent Amur (Siberian) tiger, freestyling ring-tailed lemurs shrieking close above our heads, blustering rhinos locking horns over food, and the quiet grace of the African elephant families.Small “ferry” boats with guided tours (in Dutch) take passengers from zone to zone, via lakes where we get a rare sighting of two iridescent kingfishers – a personal highlight among the more spectacular beasts. By the end of our stay, a battered map covered in ballpoint pen ticks is hard evidence of two children brimming with memories.View image in fullscreenLions live close to the accommodation and visitors can watch their feeding sessionsWe love the birds of prey display, with vultures, eagles, owls and storks swooping low over our heads, catching food thrown for them in mid-air. There are scheduled lion-feeding sessions and we stumble across the seals’ mealtime, laughing as the three blubbery mammals wriggle comically out of the lake and on to the sand.For an extra €17.50 (£15) per person, there is also the option of a 45-minute “game drive” with a guide – ours is the excellent Eva – to get up close and personal, away from the main car trails. We meet alpha male giraffe Jim and his harem, and as the herd licks the roof of our cruiser with their giant tongues, our amazed seven-year-old clicks her camera over and over again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Evenings are for indoor bowling, eating at one of multiple restaurants or relaxing back in the lodge.We visit the Speelland theme park a couple of times – a brilliantly wholesome outdoor and indoor activity centre with fairground-style rides, pedalos in the lake, go-karts and bouncy castles.We pop into nearby Tilburg (15 minutes by car; 25 minutes on a bike) for takeaway pizza, grocery shopping and a day perusing the shops and markets, visiting a traditional Dutch pancake house for lunch. There’s also time for a day trip to Amsterdam (less than 90 minutes by train from Tilburg), where we wander over the canal bridges, meander along beautiful streets with vintage antique stores and hop on and off the tram. Our youngest decides she wants to move to the pretty Dutch capital so she can ride her bike to work every day.View image in fullscreenYou can tour the resort by boat.Photograph: Wieneke HoflandBack at the park, we split our stay between the hotel and the resort. Our first few days are in one of the hotel’s Savanne rooms, geared to guests who want to eat at the resort’s many à la carte, buffet or fine dining restaurants.We then move to a Savanne lodge at the “top” of the safari resort, with a view of the bigger “Masai Mara plain”. The detached lodges are more spacious with full kitchens, ideal for self-catering families. Some even have saunas. While there is a small grocery shop on site, nearby Tilburg has plenty of supermarkets to stock up at.Our tip would be to budget for the significant additional cost of breakfast, lunch and dinner if you stay at the hotel. While the veranda view of the plain from our first hotel room is spectacular, the additional cost of eating out makes the self-catering lodge much more affordable.Is there a specific age where our fascination with animals dims, before being reignited as a parent? I would say for any child pre-secondary school – before the self-conscious cynicism and underwhelmed eye-rolls kick in – Beekse Bergen is a remarkable family holiday, especially for those interested in the natural world.“A safari in the Netherlands?” your friends will ask, intrigued and maybe a little sceptical: “How does that work?” As ever, with Dutch family vacations, it just does.The trip was provided byLittle Clogs HolidaysandBeekse Bergensafariresort.

They are caught by seine netting at dusk just a few miles from shore, and the way they are fished means they’re in perfect condition when landed. My favourite way of eating them is left whole, guts in and heads on, topped with a healthy sprinkling of coarse salt and then grilled – they’re wonderful eaten just with your hands or on bread, but today I offer up two alternatives ways with sardines.Venetian-style pickled sardines (pictured top)You will see these deliciouscicchetti, or snack, in bars all over Venice, where they sit piled high on the counter, ready to be served with a glass of wine or on top of a slice of bread. They make a great starter or light supper, and it’s a very good way to preserve the fresh fish for a few days, because the flavour gets only better with time. I’ve added a few crushed pink peppercorns to the traditional recipe, because I think they add a nice touch.Prep10 minCook15 minMarinate1 hr+Serves2as a starterGood olive oil8 fresh sardines, cleaned and gutted (heads and tails on or off – it’s up to you)Plain flour, for dusting100ml white-wine vinegar2tbsp caster sugar1 white onion, peeled and finely sliced1 tbsp sultanas1 tsp pink peppercorns, finely crushed or blitzed1 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsleyHeat 100ml olive oil in a large, wide frying pan. Working in batches, if need be, dip the sardines in the flour, shake off any excess, then fry gently for two to three minutes on each side, until cooked through. Lift out the fish, drain on kitchen paper, then arrange them side by side in a shallow rectangular dish in which they’ll all fit snugly.Mix the vinegar, sugar, four tablespoons of olive oil and 100ml cold water in a small pan, and bring to a simmer. Drop in the finely sliced onion, cook for about five minutes, until the onion is soft and giving, then stir in the sultanas and crushed pink peppercorns. Spoon the pickle mix evenly all over the sardines, finish with a sprinkling of parsley, then cover and put in the fridge to marinate for at least an hour and up to three or four days.Serve at room temperature with bread and/or a nice glass of vino.Sardine butter on sourdough with pickled mustard seeds and cucumberView image in fullscreenA fine spread: Mitch Tonks’ sardine butter on sourdough with pickled mustard seeds and cucumber.I love tinned sardines almost as much as I love fresh ones – they are so versatile and so delicious. When I was a kid, we used to have Shippam’s sardine paste sandwiches with cucumber, and this is my take on that delightful childhood food memory.Prep5 minCook15 minChill1 hr+Serves1-2120g tinsardines in oliveoil, drained1tbsp tomato puree1 pinch dried chilli flakes, to tasteSea salt125g softened butter1 pinch dried oregano1 slice sourdoughJuice of ¼ lemonFor the pickle50g white-wine vinegar2tbsp caster sugar1tbsp mustard seeds¼ cucumber, peeled, cored and finely diced1 tbsp chopped fresh dillPut the sardines, tomato puree, chilli and a pinch of salt in a blender, blitz until really smooth, then add the butter and oregano, and blitz again until well combined. Decant the sardine butter into a clean pot or jar, cover, then chill for at least an hour. The butter will now keep for up to a week.To make the pickle, put the vinegar, sugar and 100ml cold water in a small saucepan, bring to a simmer, then add the mustard seeds and leave to cook gently for 10 minutes, until they soften and plump up a bit. Take off the heat and leave to cool.Meanwhile, mix the diced cucumber with a big pinch of salt, then set aside for five minutes to draw out some of the excess moisture. Rinse off the salt, dry the cucumber well and stir into the cooled pickle mix along with the chopped dill.Grill the sourdough until it’s nicely charred on both sides, then, while it’s still hot, spread thickly with the sardine butter so it melts through the bread. Serve at once with a squeeze of lemon juice to taste and with the pickle on the side or strewn on top; a handful of rocket leaves would go nicely here, too.Mitch Tonks is chef/owner of theRockfish restaurantsin south-west EnglandThe Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish. Check ratings in your region:UK;Australia;US.* This article was edited on August 18 2025, to clarify that the butter is designed to serve 1-2, and that the chopped dill should be added to the pickle mix at the same time as the cucumber.Explore more on these topicsFoodFishSeafoodSnacksStarterVegetablesBreadrecipesShareReuse this content"
