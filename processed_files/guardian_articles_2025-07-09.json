Keir thinks the opposite. YawnWed 9 Jul 2025 12.11 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 16.08 EDTShareSpare a thought for Rachel Reeves. After last week’s mini-meltdown during prime minister’s questions, the chancellor is now condemned to spend the next year grinning manically every time she’s out and about in public. Having a bad day at the office? GRIN. Had a row with the kids? GRIN. Now there is no escape.To make it worse, you now get endless colleagues patting you on the shoulder and looking you deep in the eyes as they ask if you’re OK. When you just want to be left alone. GRIN. Everything is fine. Couldn’t be more normal. Sometimes, it’s no fun being a politician.So Rachel entered the Commons alongside Keir Starmer for this week’s PMQs grinning wildly. Of course she did. And it must have taken all Kemi Badenoch’s self-control not to have made fun of the chancellor. She might know it’s a bad look for a party leader to use someone’s mental health against them, but generally speaking she can’t help herself. Kemi is hardwired to kick an opponent when she’s down.But well done Kemi for doing the right thing. Unfortunately for her that was about the only thing she did get right. Not that Starmer himself was on sparkling form. The chaos of the welfare bill has clearly ground him down. It was more that Kemi felt a bit distracted herself. As though her heart wasn’t fully in it either. Semi-detached Kemi. ThisPMQswas just another chore to be ticked off the list. One to forget for all concerned.“Labour said there would be no more rises in income tax, personal national insurance and VAT,” she began. “Is that a promise you intend to keep?”“Yes,” replied Starmer, before sitting straight down again. One down, five to go.Kemi seemed surprised by the brevity and raced back to her notes. Not a good idea. Because her next move was to accuse Starmer of giving in to the resident doctors. Keir looked understandably confused. Largely because he hasn’t given in. The government and the doctors are in a standoff. Kemi had another go. Back to tax. Was Labour going to freeze the tax thresholds yet again?This wasn’t quite the slam dunk she thought it was. Partly because no prime minister is going to write a budget in advance, but mainly because there is no one in the country who ever imagined that Labour was going to raise the thresholds. The Tories hadn’t done so for years and had committed themselves to maintaining the freeze had they won the last election. So this was hardly a big reveal. Every government in recent years has counted on fiscal drag to balance the books.At this point, Starmer went to his own default setting and accused Badenoch of talking the country down. Which would have been music to Emmanuel Macron, who is over in the UK for a state visit. The French president is desperate for the UK to reduce the pull factor for migrants coming to this country. So what more could he ask for than Kemi to tell everyone how rubbish things really were? “Don’t come here. Nothing works. We’re all ever more broke than you.” She could empty the beaches in northern France in minutes.Kemi now turned to a wealth tax. “This is something that will affect all our constituents,” she said. Er … hello? Unless I’m missing something, the proposed wealth tax only comes into effect on people with assets in excess of £10m. Which, by my reckoning, rather excludes most constituents.Though perhaps Kemi knows something the rest of us don’t. Maybe Saffron Walden is wall-to-wall multimillionaires. But here’s something Kemi definitely doesn’t know. A wealth tax is actually quite popular with most voters. They like the idea of the super-rich paying a bit more. Even if Tory donors don’t.We ended the leaders clash where we so often do on days like these where neither Kemi nor Keir can really be bothered to engage. In an unsatisfactory stalemate. Kemi claiming the Tories had left the country with a booming economy – she still hasn’t worked out why her party only won 121 seats at the last election – and everything was now shit. Keir insisting everything had been shit and that the good times were back again.I couldn’t help feeling that both their good times had rather passed me by. I must have been asleep. At times, it feels as if no party is prepared to grasp the demographic realities of the fiscal situation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A new two-man party of the Reform Recovery Group. Cast adrift by Nigel Farage. Left to contemplate their inner futility. Though it’s possible James has other things on his mind. At present he finds himself in hot water over Covid loans.Labour’s John Slinger was not going to let McMurdock’s appearance in the Commons go unremarked. Was it not the case that anyone who was guilty of extracting Covid loans under false pretences should feel the full force of the law? Or perhaps under Lord Leveson’s recommendations, 40% of the force of the law. Starmer needed no second invitation. There was “no place for con artists and grifters in public life”.Cue the speaker. Lindsay Hoyle may be a bit of a bore at heart, more interested in securing himself a peerage than the day job, but he is occasionally capable of genius comic timing. All the better for probably being accidental. Because a nanosecond after Starmer had talked of con artists and grifters, he chose to introduce Nigel Farage.Not that anyone got to properly hear Nige amid first the general laughter and then the barracking. Poor Lee Anderson became quite overwhelmed that his leader was not getting heard and demanded that the independent MP Iqbal Mohamed shut up. The noise wasn’t a great look. Nige thrives on being the voice of the people, the man whom the establishment want to silence. Sometimes, Westminster does Nige’s job for him.But what Farage had seemed to say was that he didn’t want anyone slagging off Brexit. It had been a great idea, was still a great idea even though it was a disaster, and could he tell Macron to sink a few more boats and stop being so arrogant.What is it with Nige and Manu? A secret love tryst gone wrong? Macron seems to live rent free in Nige’s head. Despite slagging him off at every opportunity, Nige is desperate to meet him. And can’t believe it when Manu says no. He doesn’t like it when Nige talks dirty … This one will run and run.Explore more on these topicsPMQsThe politics sketchKeir StarmerKemi BadenochLabourConservativesHouse of CommonsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s yet more evidence that we live in a terrible worldLucy ManganWed 9 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTShareWhat – and I ask myself this question with increasing frequency and seriousness – are we going to do about people? What, more specifically, are we going to do about the number of irredeemably wicked ones and the amount of suffering they bring into the world?If you can get through the two-part documentary Poisoned: Killer in the Post without sliding down on to the floor in despair as these questions thunder through your mind – well, you’re a better viewer than I.Poisoned is a meticulous chronicle of the equally meticulous investigation conducted by Times journalist James Beal into the identity of the online supplier of lethal chemicals to people who had congregated on a forum where they shared their suicidal thoughts, discussed methods and, often, plans for taking their own lives.Beal was alerted to the potential story by David Parfett in 2022. A year before, Parfett had lost his 22-year-old son, Tom, to suicide. “It’s just a different world after that.” Parfett had found the forum that Tom had posted on, posed as a new user, and soon found himself directed to a website that, hidden in plain sight among a variety of other goods either permanently sold out or astronomically priced (salt for $9,999 and so on), sold the poison to anyone who ordered it, with no registration requirements and no checks. Tom continued to post on the forum for a short while after he had taken the poison, about his racing heart, then creeping numbness. “That’s my son dying,” says David.Louise Nunn lost her daughter Immy in the same terrible way after years of supporting her through mental health crises that had led to her being sectioned. She took the poison a few hours after her latest release, about which her parents had not been informed; Dawn her stepson Adam – “He was so loved”; in Arizona, Malyn lost her brother, and Lynn her son, Miles. Like Parfett, they all tried to track down the responsible parties and interest the police in their findings and their growing certainty that one man was behind the distribution of potentially thousands of packages and deaths.Beal synthesises what they have learned with his own discoveries and finds the man behind the website. Pretending to be a customer with concerns about the efficacy of the product, we hear his extraordinary conversation with a Canadian chef called Kenneth Law, who cheerfully confirms for him that people “in the UK, US and Canada” and other countries have died from his supplies. “At least a dozen … I’ve been kept busy, yeah!”View image in fullscreenLouise Nunn, who lost her daughter Immy after she took the poison she bought online.Photograph: WonderhoodOn we go, covering Beal’s exposé after further investigations, which leads to Law being charged with 14 counts of first degree murder and 14 of counselling or aiding suicide in relation to Canadian deaths. Investigations into multiple deaths linked to him in other countries are ongoing, and the National Crime Agency is considering the possibility of extraditing him.Law has not been found guilty, and did not respond to the allegations made in the series. The documentary does not, I think refreshingly, dwell too long on Law’s possible motivations. Sociopathy? Psychopathy? Badness? Some unholy combination of the above? Would it help us to know? Can we protect ourselves against any of them? The more you hear, and the more technology facilitates the spread of the worst of humanity, the more unlikely it seems.Beneath the giant shadow cast by Law, however, are others. There are the failures of the police to link the deaths of people found with the same poison in their possession or who had been posting on the same forum. There seems to have been a readiness across forces to tick the box marked “suicide”, close the case and feel no wider sense of responsibility to prevent further harm. There is the lag between old laws (in the UK, around the sale of poisons, the requirements to report, what constitutes assisting suicide, and international compatibilities) and new technology. There is the widespread and ongoing failure of all sorts of authorities and corporate megaliths to monitor even the vilest, most dangerous tracts of the internet.Whatever happens, of course, it will not bring any of the beloved lost sons and daughters back to their stricken parents. It will not restore her brother to Malyn, or any of the untold number of victims whose deaths may ultimately be laid at Law’s door.

It carries an import that will be felt right across the sport, a significance in how it played out and what happens next as the team Horner built and led to such enormous success faces an uncertain future.Horner has been at Red Bull since the team was formed in 2005 from the ashes of Jaguar, a team in no little disarray when Red Bull bought it. Horner was at the helm as it was transformed from an operation of 450 personnel, without so much as a win to their name, to one of 1,500 today that haswon eight drivers’ titlesand six constructors’ championships, and is one of the most extraordinary success stories in F1 history.Christian Horner sacked by Red Bull after 20 years as principal at F1 teamRead moreHorner has never shied away from publicity and has revelled in the role of disruptor, embracing the brickbats his team received for being backed by an energy drink manufacturer, rather than a grand old motor racing marque.“We are different atRed Bull. You won’t see anyone in a suit and tie here, it’s more jeans and T-shirt,” he said of the culture he engendered. “We don’t conform, we call it as we see it and we are not afraid to have an opinion.”That approach did not endear him to some in the paddock but, when allied to his acute sense that F1 was about bringing in the right people and enabling them to work in the best possible way, it returned huge success.Yet in the space of under two years – a bagatelle in F1 terms – so much has unravelled at Red Bull. Seventeen months ago as the team entered 2024 with their world champion Max Verstappen on a roll with three consecutive titles, Horner wasaccused of inappropriate behaviourby a female colleague.Horner always denied any wrongdoing and was subsequently exonerated by an independent investigation and despite what were purported to be leaked text messages between Horner and the employee, he has been supported by his wife, the former Spice Girl Geri Horner, throughout.However, as the controversy roiled it reflected yawning divisions within the team. Not least an internal power struggle between Horner and parent company, Red Bull GmbH, and between Horner and Verstappen’s father, the former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, who was openly calling for him to be sacked.The team’s longstanding motorsport advisor Helmut Marko, a friend to the Verstappens, was at one point under threat of suspension, prompting Verstappen in turn to threaten to leave. By F1 standards this was turmoil.View image in fullscreenChristian Horner has been involved in an internal power struggle with Max Verstappen (left) and his father Jos in recent times.Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/EPAHorner’s position looked to be hanging by a thread. Yet he rode it out and Red Bull GmbH backed off as the furore around the allegations died down and Horner still enjoyed the backing of Chalerm Yoovidhya, the Thai businessman who owns a 51% share of the company.At theBritish Grand Prix last weekendit was business as usual, with no inkling that Yoovidhya apparently must have changed his stance and the parent company were preparing to act. At the heart of the decision it is impossible not to consider that Verstappen, a once in a generation talent, has been the key piece around which all other manoeuvring has occurred.The world champion has repeatedly expressed his desire only for there to be calm and a focus directed solely on the performance of his car. He has been disappointed on both fronts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOver the past two years Red Bull have lost key personnel, not least Rob Marshall as chief engineering officer followed, crucially, byAdrian Newey, the team’s genius designer, considered to be the best of his generation, who joined Aston Martin, and then Jonathan Wheatley, the sporting director.Amid all of this the car’s performance fell away too. Last year only Verstappen’s fierce determination and an early season lead were enough to see him over the line. This season, Red Bull have been well and truly surpassed by McLaren. Verstappen’s shot at the title has already gone, while Red Bull’s second driver, Yuki Tsunoda, often struggles to so much as score points.Verstappen has been clearly dissatisfied and while under contract until 2028 other teams are already looking to lure him away, not least Mercedes with whom he has been in talks.Red Bull’s decision to remove Horner may well constitute an effort to keep him on board, to placate Verstappen and his father in the face of Mercedes’ advances, or indeed, as has been posited, that Verstappen has already done a deal and Horner is paying the price.For Verstappen it is a relatively simple equation, he wants to be in the best car and will be considering his options on that basis. Next season major regulation changes will put a focus on new engines, where it is believed Mercedes have already stolen a march, while Red Bull have committed for the first time in their history to building their own engines, a hugely complex and demanding undertaking with no guarantee of success, with rumours suggesting they are behind the curve.Which leaves Red Bull, a once formidable force, with a woeful car, in danger of losing their talismanic driver, set to enter another new era without the man who had brought them so far and in a vortex of instability. As the once mighty Williams team discovered, success is never guaranteed in F1 and Red Bull too now might consider themselves on a knife edge.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneChristian HornerRed BullMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

I can tell you that much right now,” Trump said, expressing his frustration with the Russian leader over the war in Ukraine. “We get a lot of bullshit thrown at us by Putin… He’s very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”It may not have been Churchillian in oratorical flourish, and with Trump everything is capable of being reversed in hours, but possibly, just possibly, the rupture between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump has happened. If so it is a transformatory moment, and a vindication for bothVolodymyr Zelenskyyas he arrives in Rome for the annual Ukraine reconstruction conference and for those others, notably the British and the French governments, who have patiently helped the scales to fall from Trump’s eyes about Putin’s true intentions. At long last and after many false starts, the US president seems to have accepted he is unpersuadable on ending the war.View image in fullscreenTrump and Putin at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in 2019.Photograph: Mikhail Svetlov/Getty ImagesWith Trump the parting of the ways is unlikely to be complete, or permanent. Above all Trump’s disappointment in Putin may not translate into the kind of practical financial and supportUkraineand Europe has been seeking, but America First is no longer Russia First.It has been a long process with many low points. In February it seemed as if the whole transatlantic alliance was on the brink of collapse, as Trump initiated direct talks with Putin, and ordered Ukraine to make concessions. On 19 February he echoed Kremlin talking points in apost to his Truth Social networkthat called Zelenskyy a “dictator” and warned him time was running out for Ukraine: “Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the US into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won […] A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”A week later at the UN general assembly in New York, the US opposed a European-drafted resolution condemning Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and supporting Ukraine’s territorial integrity – voting the same way asRussia, North Korea and Belarus.Veteran UK diplomats were then left shaken when the US drafted and voted for a security council resolution that called for an end to the conflict but contained no criticism of Russia. The UK and Franceboth abstained after their attempts to amend the wording were vetoed.View image in fullscreenTrump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on 28 February.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesLater that week came the televised blowup with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, followed by the hasty embrace of the Ukrainian leader in London by Keir Starmer and King Charles. The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, cheered on the White House from Moscow. “How Trump and Vance exercised restraint and didn’t punch this scumbag is a miracle of restraint,” she posted on Telegram.All the while, the US negotiator Steve Witkoff revealed a depth of ignorance about the history of Ukraine and a sympathy with Putin’s claims the war had been provoked. Frequently he tipped over from trying to understand the Russian perspective into siding with it. In an interview with Tucker Carlson that truly alarmed European diplomats, Witkoff asked: “Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose, exactly? They don’t need to absorb Ukraine. That would be like occupying Gaza … But the Russians also have what they want. They’ve gotten – they’ve reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea, and they’ve gotten what they want. So why do they need more?”Witkoff also delivered a portrait commissioned by Putin of a bloodied Trump, fist clenched, after last year’s assassination attempt. Putin revealed he had prayed for Trump, and on 14 June he remembered the president’s birthday with a phone call.Yet by the end of March, Trump’s frustrations with Putin started to show, as the Russian leader refused to commit to the 30-day ceasefire he had proposed and that Ukraine had quickly accepted. On 1 April the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, returned from eight hours playing golf with Trump to report for the first time that he was losing patience with Russia.Still, even by the end of May it was clear that the process of Trump’s patience wearing thin had an almost infinite quality. After fruitless diplomatic exchanges in Istanbul, continued evasions about a ceasefire and escalating strikes on Ukraine, Trump poured out his frustration on Truth Socialwarning that Putin was “playing with fire”and declaring in the Oval Office on 28 May that he would know within a fortnight if “Putin is tapping us along”.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted ontruthsocial.com.

The Nato summit on 25 June was gift-wrapped by Europe as a triumph for Trump on defence spending, making him better disposed to listen to Europe’s security concerns. “There is a line between flattery and self-abasement, and we happily crossed it,” said one European diplomat.The Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, called Trump “Daddy”.With his ego massaged, Trump sounded like a man less willing to be distracted by Putin. “I consider Putin a person that’s been misguided. I’m very surprised actually. I thought we would have had that war settled,” he told the media at the summit, revealing that Putin had called and offered to intervene with Iran.“I said: ‘No, no, you help me get a settlement with you, with Russia,’ and I think we are going to be doing that.”View image in fullscreenTrump was not happy when it emerged that the Pentagon was withholding arms earmarked for Ukraine and no one informed the White House. Pete Hegseth looked uncomfortable.Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockBut the next call between the two on 4 July did not go well either, and it seemed as if Putin had determined he could extract more by war than by keeping Trump sweet. The Kremlin was uncompromising: “Our president said that Russia will achieve its goals, that is, the elimination of the well-known root causes that led to the current state of affairs,” said Yuri Ushakov, a close adviser to the Russian leader. “Russia will not back down from these goals.”The deadly nightly Russian assaults on Ukraine (the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, said Russia had launched 20,000 drone strikes this year) could not be kept from US screens and, finally, Trump was not happy when it emerged last week that the Pentagon was withholding a shipment of arms earmarked for Ukraine and no one informed the White House. The defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, looked distinctly uncomfortable.For Ukraine’s supporters in Congress and in Europe, the issue now is the extent to which Trump’s frustration with Russia transmits into practical support for Kyiv. The true test will come if the crushing sanctions tabled months ago by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham are finally given the presidential go-ahead. The measures would impose a 500% tariff on imports from any country that purchases Russian uranium, gas or oil, with India and China the worst affected.Peter Mandelson, the UK ambassador to the US, has been working behind the scenes to refine Graham’s blunderbuss so the proposed secondary sanctions do not catch European firms in their net.Graham is now proposing a carve-out to his bill to spare countries who still import Russian gas, but have supported Ukraine in its three-year war with the Kremlin’s military. The bill also gives Trump the right to waive for 180 days sanctions on countries purchasing Russian oil or uranium and, in its revised form, a second 180-day waiver is proposed.“We’re moving,” Graham said after Trump’s diatribe against Putin, adding that Trump “told me it’s time to move so we’re going to move”. For Ukrainians on the frontline, they can only hope a turning point has come.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

When his daughter Joanne began digging into his past for a memoir, new lies kept emerging ...Anita ChaudhuriWed 9 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 12.09 EDTShareGrowing up in the 1960s, Joanne Briggs knew her father, Michael, wasn’t like other dads. Once a Nasa scientist, now a big pharma research director, he would regale her and her brother with the extraordinary highlights of his working life.If he was to be believed, he had advised Stanley Kubrick on the making of 2001: A Space Odyssey, smuggled a gun and a microfiche over the Berlin Wall and, most amazingly, conducted an experiment on Mars that led to the discovery of an alien life form. This was in addition to earning a PhD from Cornell University in the US and a prestigious doctor of science award from the University of New Zealand. Quite a leap for the son of a typewriter repair man who grew up in Chadderton, a mill town on the road from Manchester to Oldham, before getting his first degree from the University of Liverpool.But when Joanne was seven, her father abruptly walked out on the family. He’d been married to her dressmaker mother Marion for 13 years when he decided to leave Britain and his job at the pharmaceutical company Schering and start a new life in Africa with a colleague. “From that point on, I told myself my father wasn’t really gone – he was just somewhere else. He was incredibly important and well known, a powerful thinker who had to be elsewhere to do that,” says Joanne from her home in Sussex. She is now 61, but with her mop of auburn curls and impish grin, it’s easy to imagine her as a child, dazzled by this larger-than-life character.View image in fullscreenJoanne Briggs, author of The Scientist Who Wasn’t There.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianShe describes him as a dapper figure, always dressed in a blazer and pressed slacks, aviator sunglasses enhancing his enigmatic air. “In one of these pictures I look like a little girl holding hands with an operative from MI5, after he’d been issued with a wife and child as part of an elaborate plan to conceal his identity.” The resemblance was to prove more accurate than she realised.The illusion of a father who was not quite real was only intensified by the fact that, after he left, they would only see him fleetingly. “He would come to Europe once a year in order to go to the World Health Organization in Geneva. He’d whisk us off to London, to Harrods’ toy department, where I’d buy plush toys. We’d eat in fancy restaurants and I could order what I liked,” Joanne remembers. “After gorging on prawn cocktail and creme caramel for every meal, was it any wonder that these visits always ended with me being sick? Eat what you like for 24 hours, then nothing for 364 days. It was incredibly disruptive. After a while, when I was 11, I refused to go.”In 1976, when Joanne was 13, Briggs was appointed professor of human biology at Australia’s newly opened Deakin University. She went to visit for a couple of summer holidays but then didn’t hear from him again until she was 22. “For reasons that were unclear, he had walked out of his job in Australia and moved to Spain.”My mother was a famous feminist writer known for her candour and wit. But she was also a fantasist who couldn’t be bothered to spend time raising meRead moreThen one day in 1986 she received a message saying he was back in the UK and wanted to meet her. He told her that a Sunday Times journalist had interviewed him for a story about his activities but described the potential scandal as a “misunderstanding, a pack of lies”, driven by the jealousy and competition of academic life.With a wry smile, Joanne recalls the morning two days later when she was confronted with a photo of her father on the front pages of not just the Sunday Times but also the News of the World. The latter bore the headline “Bogus Boffin Is Unmasked”. “I don’t remember any kind of emotion, though my heart was racing as I read it,” she says. “I’d learned in childhood to step back from strong feelings around this unpredictable parent, to move away and watch.”The Sunday Times exposé by Brian Deer revealed that Briggs had faked research assessing the possible risks of heart and arterial disease in women after prolonged use of the contraceptive pill. This research, Deer said, “was extensively relied on in drug company advertising to promote the pill’s safety claim”. Briggs, he added, had “admitted serious deceptions in his research”, which had been largely funded by two drug companies, Schering of West Germany, for which Briggs had once worked, and Wyeth of the United States. Schering and Wyeth both denied knowledge of the fraud, and said they would no longer use Briggs’s research. Other experts pointed out that medical advice about the safety of the pill wasn’t based solely on Briggs’s research but on a body of work that had reached similar conclusions.Two months later, Joanne received a call informing her that her father had just died in Spain, a week after being hospitalised with delirium. “He was buried immediately, as per local custom. His wife was the only mourner at his funeral and the cause of his death is not recorded.”Given her father’s history of deception, I have to ask: has she considered that he might still be alive? Fortunately, not much fazes her these days. “I recall a journalist contacted my brother and me as soon as the news broke, with a conspiracy theory that he was either in hiding or had been killed. This never got into the papers, but it stuck with me. Combined with the unexpected and strange nature of what had happened, from the Sunday Times in September to his apparent sudden death in November, the whole thing seemed to need another explanation. I think we both thought for a while he might not be dead or had come to harm related to the scandal. But these days I hardly ever think about the possibility, remote though it is, that my father didn’t die at all.”View image in fullscreen‘Always a dapper figure’ … Michael Briggs.Photograph: Courtesy of Joanne BriggsOne might sensibly assume that that was the end of the story. And, for the next 34 years, Joanne got on with her life, had a son and became a barrister. But this was far from the final chapter. “When we were all in lockdown in 2020, and looking for things to fill our time, I was reading the Cumberlege report,” she recalls. Officially known as theIndependent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Review, this looked at how the NHS had responded to women’s concerns about a number of medical treatments.Now involved with the legal side of the detention and discharge of psychiatric patients, Joanne started reading the document for her job. “My interest was sodium valproate, a mood stabiliser included in the review. But then I read about this other drug, Primodos, a hormone-based pregnancy test.“I’d never even heard of Primodos but it kept popping up,” says Joanne, “and to my astonishment so did my father’s name.” In 2014, she discovered, Yasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South and Walkden, had mentioned Briggs in a House of Commons debate about Primodos, which had been manufactured by his former employer Schering. She then stumbled upon a 1992 Nature journal paper,Reflections of a Whistle-blower by Jim Rossiter, who was head of the ethics committee at Deakin University and had been quoted in Deer’s Sunday Times article. “Rossiter was angry about the way he’d been treated by the institution. He accused my dad of being abusive and unpleasant – and, while he’s at it, he states that he doesn’t believe that my father had a doctorate from Cornell. He suggests that he had made it up, and probably the prestigious doctor of science award from New Zealand University as well.”Joanne was intrigued. The red and blue theses were on a shelf in her brother’s study. “I thought: ‘This is easily provable.’” She contacted Cornell University, which did indeed have a publication by “Michael H Briggs, 1959” in its library. “But somehow, I felt I couldn’t just leave it at that. I contacted the librarian and asked for some screenshots of its pages. I suppose as a barrister I am used to proving things.”The pictures were of a volume very similar to the one in the UK. Almost the same, but not quite. The library version, the real one, isn’t a PhD thesis at all – it’s labelled a master’s dissertation, one you’d write up at the end of a one-year course. And it has an account by her father of how he’d come to Cornell for a year to study for said MSc. He’d made the PhD up.From this point on, everything started to unravel. Further investigations revealed that the doctor of science award was murky as well. Two eminent scientists had rejected Briggs’s application – but whether through an administrative oversight or someone acting in a more calculated fashion, somehow it still succeeded. Given that all this happened in the early 60s, the truth will probably never be known.View image in fullscreenJoanne and her brother Andrew in Manchester, 1969.Photograph: Courtesy of Joanne BriggsAt this juncture, Joanne started telling her friends about everything she had uncovered. “I told them: ‘You know all those things I told you about my dad, the incredible scientist? Turns out he made the whole thing up.’ Many of them said I should write a book. When I had 8,000 words or so, I decided to enter the Bridport Memoir prize.” In 2022 she was named as the winner.Now published, The Scientist Who Wasn’t There documents her father’s extraordinary career as a liar and fantasist, but also explores the impact his actions had on his family. “Writing the book gave me a much better understanding of my dad as a person than if I had not found out all these things about him. He would have remained a fantasy figure. I’d previously seen him as someone who moved ever upwards from job to job, opportunity to opportunity. Now I see it as a career of repeated flight, of him abruptly moving away from situations where he might get found out and towards lesser-known institutions who were grateful to have him. They thought he was marvellous because he told them he was – it’s a classic conman routine.”Briggs did indeed work for Nasa, based at the California Institute of Technology. But Joanne believes the brevity of his sojourn there in 1962 holds the biggest mystery of all. “He was only there for a year, probably less. I think something must have gone very wrong because that was his fantasy job, he was working on Mars probes. They probably rumbled him.”In 1963, shortly before Joanne was born, Briggs left Nasa and moved back to the UK to take up a research post at Analytical Labs, an animal feed laboratory in Wiltshire. It wasn’t an obvious move. “While researching the book, I looked into this mysterious lab and discovered it was known by another name at Companies House, and that it had never had any connection with agriculture whatsoever.” The company was based at Corsham, a Ministry of Defence base; when her father went to work there, this was also the home of the Central Government War Headquarters, the secret bunker intended to house the government in the event of nuclear war.Is she suggesting that her father was in fact a spy? “I think of all the theories, it’s the one that hangs together most coherently,” she says. “He had extremely high security clearance because of his Nasa work. Why would you need that to work with animal feed?” In the book, she suggests that the animal feed work could have a link to the government’s plans for agricultural capacity after a nuclear attack. Then there’s the fact that a few years later, in 1966, Briggs suddenly went to work for Schering’s UK research department in the area of hormone research – totally unrelated to either Mars or animal feed. Schering was on the radar of intelligence agencies because unusually, it had bases in both East and West Germany.How has all of this affected her? Joanne is delightful company with a dry sense of humour and, like her father, is a natural raconteur. “Growing up, there was a sense of almost romantic longing for my father. As an adult, well, I have never been able to watch films like Father of the Bride. I’ve never been able to tolerate dramas about fathers and daughters. I couldn’t face that loss, though I could probably watch one now. I’ve been married and divorced twice and I’m not currently married. So, my own ability to stay married may have been influenced by my past.”The sudden, surprising rise of beard transplants: ‘This industry is a wild west’Read moreDoes she believe her father harmed people? “That is so, so hard to answer. If you look at him through the prism of fabrication and the identity that he’d created, he was not the scientist who he claimed to be. Would he have been able to make good decisions, or might he have allowed decisions to ride for a little bit too long? Would he have had the confidence to make difficult decisions and carry them out? He probably wasn’t the best choice to be a director at Schering, whatever they wanted him to do there. I think that’s about as far as I can go.”Does she feel disappointed in him? She stops to think. “There’s a French expression, ‘Toutcomprendre, c’est toutpardonner’, which means to know everything is to forgive everything. He was a man who grew up reading science fiction and got the idea that he could be a spaceman, that he could know all of science. And maybe he thought there were people at Oxford or Cambridge that might beat him to it. Maybe he thought he hadn’t the time to stand still and prove to everyone how clever he was – that he needed to fake it until he made it. And then he kind of forgot he was faking it.”The Scientist Who Wasn’t There by Joanne Briggs is published by Ithaka (£20).To support the Guardian order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

This yin-yang spectacle is a rare chance for fans to see the world’s most influential figures in rap and R&B in one night, and to bask in their chemistry as storied collaborators.Their sets weave together over three hours, welcoming us first into Lamar’s incisive (and enjoyably irritable) state-of-the-artform address, filmed austerely in black and white, before blossoming into full colour for SZA’s tactile songwriting about exes, bad habits and heart-leaping, interplanetary hope. The contrast is abrupt but high-energy, and when they overlap for duets, everything changes again: Lamar permits himself a broad grin asSZAcircles him, looking very much in charge, during the seductive back and forth of Luther.For Lamar, this tour is about narrative. He arrives on stage, pointedly in the driver’s seat of the black GNX from his latest album of the same name. An opening gambit speeds through Wacced Out Murals’ laundry list of betrayals by his peers, his arm fixed defensively across his chest; and a painfully abridged King Kunta, which swerves to a halt after its now decade-old Drake dig: “A rapper with a ghostwriter? What the fuck happened?” Chased by Element, on which he swears allegiance to his craft and, brilliantly, to making it “look sexy”, the sentiment is clear: he’s at the top of his game, and he’s pissed off by the lack of competition.View image in fullscreenYin and yang … SZA and Kendrick Lamar.Photograph: Cassidy MeyersLucky, then, that SZA is here to fight for Glasgow’s hearts and minds. Her fairy-grotto set feels like a different planet; dancers dressed as ants writhe as she drapes across the GNX, now covered in vines. Beaming, she gets a huge response to platinum singles such as Kill Bill and Broken Clocks – a woozily gorgeous, millennial take on 9 to 5’s work hustle – but it’s the grungy double-punch of Scorsese Baby Daddy and F2F that really ignites: dancers with electric guitars slide on their knees as she ad-libs with goosebump-inducing intensity.Her magic extends to surmounting the disappointing sound quality – overbearing reverb makes it a challenge to pick out Lamar’s intricacies, but somehow the echoes suit SZA, who sounds both raw and bracingly powerful.There are sightline issues too, with the stage’s wide runways forcing the crowd to the extreme left and right, making it almost impossible to see inside a central inset, but the atmosphere – like the near-constant pyrotechnics – remains heated. Lamar’s pulverising Drake diss Not Like Us shakes the stands and likely Hampden’s neighbouring tenements, the crowd roaring that viral “a-minooor” taunt.The set closes on Gloria, a gentle duet about a shared commitment to artistry: “I see you, you see me,” croons SZA. But it should have been All the Stars – when they teetered on two enormous risers for the Black Panther hit, separated by a sea of fans, it felt like a genuinely historic celebration of their individual achievements and the elevating power of their friendship.Kendrick Lamar and SZA:Grand National Touris in the UK and Europe until 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicKendrick LamarRapSZAHip-hopR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

A No 10 spokesperson said afterwards: “The leaders agreed tackling the threat of irregular migration and small boat crossings is a shared priority that requires shared solutions.”Starmer has prioritised signing a “one-in, one-out” deal which would have led to Britain accepting asylum seekers who could show a family connection to the UK, but returning those who could not.The French newspaper Le Mondereported on Wednesdaythat an initial pilot scheme would mean Britain would send back only 2,600 people a year – about 6% of the total number of crossings. But British officials hope they can increase those numbers after any pilot scheme ends.With negotiations going on into Wednesday evening, aides on both sides said there remained significant areas of disagreement, one of which is money.The UK signed a £480m deal two years ago to pay for additional border patrols and surveillance equipment such as drones and night-vision binoculars. Since then the French have agreed to intercept boats in the sea which are up to 300 metres from their shore, and arenow asking for extra fundingto pay for police officers, boats and drones to enforce that policy.France has been looking for money to expand its Compagnie de Marche, a specialist unit of officers which operates on beaches to tackle the people-smuggling trade and intercept crossings.Other obstacles to the deal include opposition from the southern European countries of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain, all of which have experienced high levels of irregular migration.This so-called Med 5 group is concerned that asylum seekers who are sent back from the UK to France could then decide to travel back through Europe to their countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One government aide said: “If the French were asking us to do more illegal working raids, we would be fine with that.”A No 10 spokesperson said Starmer had used Wednesday’s meeting to stress the action the UK is taking on this front.“[He] spoke of his government’s toughening of the system in the past year to ensure rules are respected and enforced, including a massive surge in illegal working arrests to end the false promise of jobs that are used to sell spaces on boats,” the person said.One final concern on the French side, diplomats said, is that their policy of stopping boats 300 metres away from shore may be susceptible to challenge in their domestic courts.UK sources said on Wednesday the deal was still a possibility, although some European officials were pessimistic about the chances of it being agreed during this visit.One French diplomatic source described the idea as “a hostage to fortune”, saying the UK had made few guarantees about how many people they would take and that agreement with the wider EU looked as remote as ever.Britain and France also said on Wednesday they would be willing to mount a joint nuclear response to an extreme military threat – possibly from countries such as Russia and China – and that “any adversary threatening the vital interests of Britain or France” could be confronted by the “nuclear forces of both nations”.The joint nuclear declaration, a first, forms part of a deepened Lancaster House defence cooperation agreement announced between the two countries, which also sees the two place orders for more Storm Shadow missiles, and begin work on a next generation anti-ship missile together.The UK described the new agreement as an “entente industrielle” and said it would support more than 300 jobs at the Stevenage production line where Storm Shadow missiles are made by Anglo-French manufacturer MBDA. The number of new missiles being ordered was not made clear.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronEuropeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He said theConservativesand Labour had “wrecked” the country over the past 20 years.In an articlefor the Sun, Berry said he was leaving the Conservative party after 25 years as a member and 14 as an MP. He said his former party shared responsibility with Labour for the state of the UK.“I hear from people in my community and beyond who say the same thing – ‘This isn’t the Britain I grew up in.’ And they’re right,” he wrote.“It didn’t start with Labour. The Conservative governments I was part of share the blame … If you were deliberately trying to wreck the country, you’d be hard-pressed to do a better job than the last two decades of Labour and Tory rule.“Millions of people, just like me, want a country they can be proud of again. The only way we get that is with Reform in government. That’s why I’ve resigned from the Conservative party. I’m now backing Reform UK and working to make them the next party of government.”The former MP for Rossendale and Darwen said that people who had believed in Johnson’s levelling up agenda in northern English seats had been particularly let down.“The truth is, the Conservatives have lost their way. They’ve abandoned their principles. They’ve abandoned the British people. And they’ve abandoned me,” he wrote.Berry, who will bring significant organising experience to Reform, said that his new party “is now the real opposition. Not the Conservatives. Not the Lib Dems. They’ve had their chance and now Reform represents our last chance.”Berry is the fifth former Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK in recent years and the second ex-cabinet minister, after the former Welsh secretary David Jones.Lee Anderson, who was Conservative MP for Ashfield, defected during the previous parliament and is one of Reform UK’s four MPs. Others who have defected include the ex-MP Marco Longhi and Andrea Jenkyns, who is the Reform mayor for Greater Lincolnshire.No sitting Conservative MP has defected during this parliament, though there are significant concerns among party officials that the former home secretary Suella Braverman might consider moving to Farage’s party.Berry lost his seat in Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire in last July’s general election to Labour’s Andy MacNae, who had a majority of 6,000 over him.MacNae won with 18,247 votes to Berry’s 12,619, while Reform’s candidate, Daniel Matchett, followed in third with 9,695 votes.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Speaking to the Guardian, MPs from the group said the government also had to change the way it related to voters, speaking less about growth in the G7 and more about the cost of food.It aims to submit a slew of ideas on driving down everyday costs to government before the autumn, in an attempt to combat the threat to Labour from both leftwing parties and Reform.The letter is the latest sign of a more activist parliamentary party ready to push its own ideas to No 10 and the Treasury after the tussle over welfare this month.In their letter to Starmer, which reiterates support for the prime minister and the government, the 104 MPs said there were welcome efforts to raise incomes via investment in industry and changes to workers rights – but said there should now be a big effort towards also lowering everyday costs.“Our constituents will ask one question at the next election: did this Labour government make me better off?” it said.“We have some of the highest electricity, housing, and childcare bills in Europe. This is because we are dependent on natural gas for our power, don’t have enough social homes and the last government failed to invest in the childcare we need … [living standards] is the most important issue to our constituents and the country.”MPs involved in the group – four of whom sit on the Treasury select committee and most in swing seats – said they also believed a renewed focus on living standards would help rebuild faith among disillusioned voters.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves and Keir Starmer. The letter is the latest sign of a more activist parliamentary party ready to push its own ideas to No 10 and the Treasury.Photograph: WPA/Getty Images“It’s not just about the electoral challenge, but also about our values,” the group’s convenor, Dr Jeevun Sandher, said.“Our Labour values are about ensuring everyone can earn a decent life. It’s the difference between us and the other side and how we help people to get there. So it’s about both the political focus and providing the ideas. What more can we do to help people feel it?”Andrew Lewin, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, who is on the organising committee, said: “It’s also a little bit less talking about the G7, a little bit more about groceries.”Sandher, the MP for Loughborough, said the group was motivated by polling that suggested 50% of voters who described themselves as economically insecure had stopped supporting Labour since last July.“You’ve got young graduate renters going to the Greens because they find their housing costs are really expensive. And you’ve got people in post-industrial areas going to Reform because they’re finding everything else really expensive, as well as finding it difficult to find good jobs. And both sides are pulling the ‘I want radical change’ lever,” he said.Sandher added that the party made had to make decisive and tangible progress on energy bills, housing and everyday costs. “I think if we don’t have that, then I’m not going to get re-elected. Let’s be honest about it,” he said.The group said it wanted to maintain a broad ideological composition across both new and longtime MPs, with a significant diversity of seats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said each policy would be progressive, helping both low- and middle-class households, improve economic efficiency and increase growth and must be cost-neutral or funded by progressive taxation.“Even in constituencies which are relatively affluent like mine, there are such deep pockets of deprivation,” Yang said. “All working families across the income spectrum feel like they are being squeezed.”Lewin said it was clear many people felt they needed to see a much faster pace of change. “There is an anxiety there because things have been so bad for the last 14 years. And even if we see wage growth … we see the savings ratio growing, which shows people do have a bit more but are keeping hold of it,” he said.McEvoy, who also co-chairs the Labour Growth group with Curtis, said bills and low wages were also taking a huge toll on people’s mental health. “They’re one bill away from crisis and it’s having a massive knock-on effect to mental health,” she said.“It’s about people’s expectations of what they thought their life would be like and. continuously grafting but can’t seem to keep their head above water.”Curtis said he believed the focus would also help be a unifying force within the party where there had been divisions over strategy. “For years it has polled as the top issue facing voters. We can have all of these arguments in the Labour party about whether we need to care about voters we’re losing to the Greens, whether we need to care about voters we’re losing to Reform or others.“But actually right across that voter coalition when you sit down and speak to those voters, they will all say the biggest problem facing their lives is the price of food in the shops.”Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerUK cost of living crisisFood povertyEnergy billsHousingReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Civilians and prisoners of war were subjected to mock executions, the severing of body parts and electric shocks, including to intimate areas of their bodies, the court said.Finding repeated violations of the convention, many of which had taken place over a period of more than eight years, the court said: “These actions seek to undermine the very fabric of the democracy on which the Council of Europe and its member states are founded by their destruction of individual freedoms, their suppression of political liberties and their blatant disregard for the rule of law.“In none of the conflicts previously before the court has there been such near universal condemnation of the ‘flagrant’ disregard by the respondent state for the foundations of the international legal order established after the second world war.”Ukraine hailed the judgment as “historic and unprecedented”, saying it was an “undeniable victory”. Russia did not participate in the proceedings and said it would ignore the judgment.Violations identified by the court included:Indiscriminate military attacks.Summary executions of civilians and Ukrainian military personnel.Torture, including the use of rape as a weapon of war.Unlawful and arbitrary detention of civilians.Unjustified displacement and transfer of civilians.Intimidation, harassment and persecution of all religious groups other than adherents of the historically Moscow-aligned Ukrainian Orthodox church.Intimidation and violence against journalists and new laws prohibiting and penalising the dissemination of information in support of Ukraine.Forcible dispersal by the Russian military of peaceful protests in occupied towns and cities.Destruction, looting and expropriation of property.Suppression of the Ukrainian language in schools and indoctrination of Ukrainian schoolchildren.Transfer toRussia, and in many cases, the adoption there of Ukrainian children.The court said: “The prevalence of sexual violence and rape by Russian soldiers in occupied territory is especially abhorrent. The evidence shows the extreme violence of the circumstances in which women were raped or sexually assaulted and the intent to terrorise, humiliate and debase them … In addition to the impact on the direct victims, the raping of women and girls in the context of an armed conflict has also been described as a means for the aggressor to symbolically and physically humiliate the defeated men.“Rape or the threat of rape is also used to drive communities off lands or to heighten terror during attacks. The evidence also attests to the horrific sexual violence frequently perpetrated upon male detainees. The sexual abuse, torture and mutilation of male detainees is often carried out to attack and destroy their sense of masculinity or manhood.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Russia has previously told the court of its intention not to enforce judgments or pay damages.A total of 26 signatory states to the convention intervened as third parties in the case and expressed their support for making Russia accountable for violations of human rights arising from its invasion of Ukraine.The court also found that theshooting down of flight MH17using a missile supplied and transported to eastern Ukraine by the Russian Federation, resulting in the deaths of all 298 civilians onboard, was in breach of the convention.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropean court of human rightsEuropeHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

Heartbreaking accusations that Moth has made up his illness have been made, leaving us devastated.”In a statement on her website, she said that the article was “grotesquely unfair, highly misleading and seeks to systematically pick apart my life”.Winn, 63, continued: “The Salt Path is about what happened to Moth and me, after we lost our home and found ourselves homeless on the headlands of the south-west.“It’s not about every event or moment in our lives, but rather about a capsule of time when our lives moved from a place of complete despair to a place of hope.“The journey held within those pages is one of salt and weather, of pain and possibility. And I can’t allow any more doubt to be cast on the validity of those memories, or the joy they have given so many.”In The Salt Path, the couple lose their house due to a bad business investment. But the Observer reported that the couple lost their home after an accusation that Winn had stolen thousands of pounds from her employer.It also said that it had spoken to medical experts who were sceptical about Moth having CBD, given his lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them.Winn’s publishing house,Penguin, said it “undertook all the necessary pre-publication due diligence”, including a contract with an author warranty about factual accuracy, and a legal read.It added: “Prior to the Observer inquiry, we had not received any concerns about the book’s content.”PSPA, a charity that supports people with CBD and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), said it had “terminated” its relationship with the couple after the Observer article.Winn had been scheduled to make numerous appearances this summer, performing with Saltlines, her collaboration with Gigspanner Big Band. However, the band subsequently announced on social media that she will no longer be taking part in the tour.Explore more on these topicsRaynor WinnPenguinnewsShareReuse this content"

The widespread rivers were probably replenished by regular rain or snowfall in the region, researchers said.“Water has been found on Mars countless times before, but what’s really interesting here is that this is an area where for a long time we’ve thought there wasn’t any evidence for water,” said Adam Losekoot, a PhD student at theOpen University. “What we found is that the area did have water and it was very distributed,” he added. “The only water source that could have sustained these rivers over such a vast area would have to be some kind of regional precipitation.”The most dramatic signs of ancient water on Mars are the huge valley networks and canyons, thought to have been carved by water flowing across the terrain. But some areas of the planet have few valleys, leading scientists to question how wet the regions once were.One region that particularly puzzled researchers was Noachis Terra, or Land of Noah, one of the oldest landscapes on Mars. According to computer models of the ancient Martian climate, the region should have had substantial rain or snowfall, sculpting the terrain as the water flowed.Faced with a lack of evidence for ancient riverbeds, Losekoot and his colleagues turned to high-resolution images of Noachis Terra captured by instruments onboard Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and Mars Global Surveyor. The images covered nearly 4m square miles of the planet’s southern highlands, a land area much larger than Australia.The images revealed scores of geological features called fluvial sinuous ridges, also known as inverted channels. These form when tracks of sediment carried by ancient rivers harden over time, and are later exposed when the softer ground around them erodes. While some tracks are relatively narrow, others are more than a mile wide.“We have lots of little ridge segments, and they are usually a couple of hundred metres wide and about 3.5km long, but there are some that are much, much larger than that,” Losekoot said.In one image from the MRO the pattern of fluvial sinuous ridges reveals a network of meandering tributaries and spots where the ancient riverbanks burst. Two rivers can be seen crossing into a crater, where water probably flowed in and filled it up before breaching the other side.The findings,to be presentedon Thursday at the Royal Astronomical Society’s national meeting in Durham, suggest an enduring presence of surface water in the Noachis Terra region of Mars about 3.7bn years ago.In its warmer, wetter past, the planet held vast bodies of water. Mars became the arid world we know today when its magnetic field waned, allowing the solar wind to erode its atmosphere and the water to escape into space. But some water may remain, unseen. Beyond Mars’s polar ice caps, an international teamreported in April, a vast reservoir of water could lie hidden deep beneath the Martian surface.Explore more on these topicsMarsSpacePlanetsResearchOpen UniversitynewsShareReuse this content"

Where it is, the cause is not just cosmetic, it is economic. Policies relating to shopfronts, rents or parking miss the bigger picture.Affluent city centres have fewer shop vacancies“City centres that struggle are oversupplied with shops and undersupplied with people. If local residents don’t have money to spend or a reason to be in the centre, high streets suffer – no matter what interventions are made.”In more affluent areas, for example, high streets have been able to shift towards dining and drinking and other leisure activities as a portion of traditional shopping activity has shifted online, because residents have spare cash to spend on non-essentials.In poorer areas where fewer people live in the city centre, the lack of spending power means this shift has not happened and funding is needed to bring people back.“A struggling high street is the outcome of a struggling [local] economy, not the other way round,” the report said.In more affluent York, London and Edinburgh, about £1 in every £4 is spent on dining out and relatively few stores are empty – just over 9%. In London, the vacancy rate was 7.4%. However in Bradford, Stoke and Wigan – which are among the locations with the highest vacancy rates – it is about £1 in every £10 and vacancy rates are more than 16%.The spending power of a local population is not just measured by high-paying jobs but also the number of people in a catchment compared with the size of a high street.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Wallace appears as a judge right up until the series finale.It was only at that point in production that Wallace stood aside, afterBBCNews said it had heard from 13 people alleging he had behaved inappropriately at work, including by making inappropriate sexual comments, on occasions over a 17-year period.Details of a report into his behaviour, commissioned by Banijay and overseen by the law firm Lewis Silkin, are expected to be published imminently.Meanwhile, BBC News says it has been approached by more than 50 further people with fresh claims about the presenter. They include allegations, denied by Wallace, of groping one co-worker and having pulled his trousers down in front of another.Wallace has admitted using inappropriate language but claims to have been cleared of “the most serious and sensational accusations made against me”.It now falls toTim Davie, the BBC’s director general, to make a decision over the series’ fate. Wallace’s presence throughout is understood to be significant enough that editing him out is not a realistic option.However, shelving the series entirely could be seen as disregarding the huge amount of work involved in putting the show together, on the part of the production team and the contestants. In the case of the latter, exposure onMasterChefhas frequently lead to life-changing opportunities.Last year’s series of MasterChef had already been shown in its entirety on BBC One by this point in the summer. Its first episode aired in April 2024, with the final broadcast in May.This was followed by new runs of Celebrity MasterChef and MasterChef: The Professionals, both of which also featured Wallace in a prominent role. In December,Grace Dent was announced as Wallace’s replacementfor the next celebrity series.View image in fullscreenThe next series of Celebrity MasterChef will be overseen by John Torode and Grace Dent.Photograph: BBC/PADavie’s dilemma comes hot on the heels of controversies around the BBC’s Glastonbury festival coverage andits decision not to show a documentary about medics in Gaza. His stewardship of the BBC began in 2020, andhis allies now fear it could be at risk.Last month,the BBC failed to end a Glastonbury livestreamthat showed the duo Bob Vylan leading the crowd in chants of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.Afterwards, Davie, who was at the festival on the evening of the performance, was given the full backing of the BBC board and its chair, Samir Shah.At the same time, the BBC was already facing criticism for not broadcasting the documentaryGaza: Doctors Under Attack, citing concern that it could create a “perception of partiality”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because, first of all, they think … someone likeGregg Wallaceis extremely powerful, and therefore who’s going to listen to them?”Among the new allegations revealed by BBC News was a claim that Wallace took his trousers down in front of a woman in a dressing room. The woman, who worked on MasterChef between 2011 and 2013, described the alleged incident as “disgusting and predatory”. At the time, MasterChef was made by Shine, a company now owned by Banijay.A BBC spokesperson said: “Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.”Banijay also said it would not comment on the report until it was officially published.Explore more on these topicsGregg WallaceBBCMasterChefTim DavieSexual harassmentCelebrity MasterChefFood TVnewsShareReuse this content"

But poll after poll now says Labour’s base has collapsed and the party will come third in the Senedd elections next May, afterPlaid Cymruand Reform UK. In Westminster, the worry is the Welsh elections will prove a bellwether for the next general election in 2029.The parliamentary Labour party has not learned from the “death of Scottish Labour” in the 2007 Holyrood elections in which the Scottish National party emerged as the largest party, according to Labour and Co-operative Senedd member Lee Waters. The MS for Llanelli is standing down next year, along with more than a third of the Senedd’s 30 Labour members so far.“The indifference to the reasonable claims of a devolved government, the control of the party machinery by London HQ, and thedisdain of Westminster MPstowards their devolved counterparts were features then and now,” he wrote on his blog.Morgan has a tightrope to walk. Speaking to the Guardian at the party conference, she said there was no contradiction between the conference’s message that Cardiff Bay and Westminster were working together as a “partnership in power” and the more leftwing “red Welsh way” she set out a few weeks earlier in a speech that criticised Keir Starmer.View image in fullscreenEluned Morgan has to balance the contradiction between a leftwing ‘red Welsh way’ and a partnership with Westminster.Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images“Some of the things introduced by the UK government have not necessarily been in keeping with the red Welsh way,” she said, referring to the prime minister’s U-turns over the winter fuel tax and disability benefit reforms.“We had the same situation in the Blair years and it’s what devolution is about: you do what’s appropriate for your particular local circumstances, but it doesn’t mean if you’re in the Labour family that you fall out altogether. It means you can have a distinct approach to certain things.”Yet the prime minister’s conference address suggested Westminster did not fully appreciate the threats Welsh Labour is facing. The former Conservative cabinet minister and former MP for Clwyd West David Jones announced on Mondayhe had joined Reform, becoming the most senior ex-Tory to join the party so far, although he said he had no intention of standing for election.Under the new more proportional system voting system coming in next year,Reform could pick up the largest number of seatsin the Senedd, as its support is more evenly distributed than other parties’ – but it is unlikely to be able to form a majority government.Yet Starmer used his keynote speech to attack Nigel Farage, even though comprehensive analysis by the Welsh Election Study suggested Labour voters inWaleswere far more likely to go to Plaid Cymru. He also warned of a “backroom stitch-up” between Plaid Cymru, the Conservatives and Reform in May, although the Welsh nationalist party has repeatedly ruled out working with either rightwing rival in next year’s Senedd.View image in fullscreenFormer first minister Mark Drakeford has not helped dispel criticisms of a lack of vision by saying next year’s budget will have no new policies.Photograph: Welsh Government/PA“I was cringing when he said that,” a Labour figure in Cardiff Bay said. “It’s as if the UK government has already decided the Welsh government isn’t a priority they are going to fight for.”Many in Westminster would argue Welsh Labour has itself to blame for ushering in the new voting system that could now help them lose office. It also emerged at Llandudno that Welsh Labour was yet to select candidates for the new lists, and was unlikely to be able to finish the process before September – putting Plaid Cymru months ahead.Mark Drakeford, the former first minister, announced last week there would be no new policies in next year’s budget to “avoid political wrangling”, which has not helped dispel criticisms Welsh Labour is lacking vision before the election fight of its life.“We can’t just scaremonger by saying Reform or Plaid Cymru are unknown quantities,” another Labour source in Cardiff Bay said. “We’ve got 10 months to show we have ideas and we can deliver. But we’ve also had 26 years to do that.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Once the darling of the Emmys, The Bear initially called itself a comedy, despite not really having any jokes or levity or fun in it. And this was down to some bad maths about its duration. The Bear was a half-hour show, and sitcoms are half-hour shows, therefore The Bear must be a sitcom.The Bear is not a comedy and it’s time to stop pretending it isRead moreHowever, in its fourth season, The Bear was no longer a half-hour show. Of its 10 new episodes, none are less than 30 minutes long. True, one is 31 minutes and three more scrape in under 35 minutes. But one is 38 minutes long, two more stretch on for 40 or more, and one somehow manages to be one hour and 11 minutes long.Now, it’s important that we shouldn’t only pick on The Bear here. Plenty of shows are at it. Netflix’s new Lena Dunham series Too Much is equally elastic when it comes to runtimes, with episodes lasting anywhere between 31 and 56 minutes long. And then there’sStranger Things, which ballooned from an average runtime of 50.6 minutes in season one to 86.8 minutes in season four. And it’s only going to get worse. From all the chatter about the upcoming final season of Stranger Things, it sounds like you should reasonably expect to die of old age at some point before the end of episode four.In a way, this was to be expected. The death of scheduled linear television means that programmes no longer have to staunchly adhere to set runtimes. A sitcom no longer has to be exactly 22 minutes long, because it doesn’t have to duck out of the way for mandatory ad breaks and wrap up so that everyone can watch the news.At first, that was considered a good thing. For once, creativity got to trump commerce. Writers and producers were finally able to tell the stories they wanted to tell, with no concessions to be made to schedulers or advertisers. It meant that we, the viewers, were being gifted uncut, unfiltered access to the minds of the greatest storytellers known to man. What a treat.Except now it is starting to become increasingly apparent that the minds of the greatest storytellers known to man might benefit from the service of a good editor. Although they’re free to make episodes of any length they like, that almost universally means that they’re going to be longer, not shorter.This isn’t necessarily a good thing. There’s a reason why Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt started to suffer in quality as it went along. The first (best) season was initially made for NBC, and so it was tight and fast and broadcast-ready. Subsequent seasons were made forNetflixand, although episodes only gained about five minutes extra each, those five minutes were full of weaker jokes that would have almost certainly been cut for time. And that’s just five minutes. At least one new Stranger Things episode is rumoured to run over two and a half hours. It sounds absolutely exhausting.Especially if, like a lot of us, you’re quite time-poor. On an average evening, once dinner has been cooked and plates have been washed up and the children have finally been wrestled to bed, you might only have a maximum of two hours to watch everything you want to watch before you need to sleep. And with that in mind, it’s hard to see these extended runtimes as anything other than robbery. There are so many brilliant things to watch at the moment, but we can’t watch everything we planned because The Bear has decided to make a meandering, plot-free 70-minute wedding episode. Already I’m planning to carve up Stranger Things like a frozen meat raffle and dole it out in pieces over the course of a couple of months. It’s the only way I’ll survive it. Please, creators, I’m begging you to stop the bloat.It’s something that The Bear especially should remember. The greatest episode it ever made – the one that initially put it on the map as a force to be reckoned with – was Review, the penultimate episode of season one. Filmed in a single claustrophobic take, it was a masterpiece of escalating tension. And it was only 21 minutes long. Those 21 minutes contained more action, more character work, morestory, than this season’s 71-minute slogathon. This is the direction we should be heading in: tighter, less fatty, more exciting. Throughout season four, The Bear repeatedly cut to a sign reading “Every Second Counts”. It’s time it started taking its own advice.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe BearStranger ThingsLena DunhamNetflixUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In it, Rhian Teasdale sings about the pleasures of doing nothing over guitars that bend in and out of tune in the style patented by My Bloody Valentine. Nothing much happens in the song – there’s some discussion about possibly getting a takeaway, and a brief nod to the “happy comatose” effects of weed – but it does feature a few lines that function as a kind ofWet Legorigin story. “Maybe we could start a band as some kind of joke,” sings Teasdale. “Well, that didn’t quite go to plan … now we’ve been stretched across the world”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Moisturizer.You don’t need to be a member of Wet Leg and aware of the circumstances of their formation – apparently the result of a conversation between Teasdale and guitarist Hester Chambers while on a ferris wheel – to feel slightly surprised at their continued success and how hotly anticipated their second album has turned out to be. Their breakthrough debut single Chaise Longue was a great song, but it carried a hint of the left-field novelty hit, the kind of funny-weird track that temporarily ignites indie disco dancefloors and festival audiences before it and its authors recede swiftly into memory: the latest addition to a pantheon that includes Electric Six’s Gay Bar, Liam Lynch’s United States of Whatever, and – one for readers of a certain age – the Sultans of Ping’s Where’s Me Jumper? But that wasn’t what happened at all.Wet Leg’s eponymous debut album turned out to be stuffed with both hooks of a kind you don’t really get in British alt-rock these days and witty, sharply-drawn vignettes of life among the provincial hipsters of the Isle of Wight – Wet Dream, which turned into an even bigger hit than Chaise Longue, cast a weary eye over a Vincent Gallo-obsessed letch. The album went gold in the UK, made the US Top 20 and won two Brits and two of the three Grammys it was nominated for.Something that was a “kind of joke” has ended up a remarkably big deal: at one juncture, Teasdale and Chambers became so weary of inquiries as to when their second album was coming out, they took to telling interviewers it was already finished, when they hadn’t started work on it. That said, Moisturizer does not seem much like the work of a band nervous about following up an unexpectedly huge debut. It’s a very confident record indeed, from the leering grin Teasdale sports on its cover, to the big, knowingly dumb garage rock riffs that gust through Catch These Fists and Pillow Talk, to the dramatic shift in its lyrics. The goings-on in Ryde’s indie crowd have been supplanted as chief subject matter. “Hello, 999, what’s your emergency / Well, the thing is … I’m in love,” gasps Teasdale on opener CPR, which pretty much sets the album’s tone. You hear an awful lot about her blossoming relationship with her partner, and indeed her surprise at the discovery her sexuality was more fluid than she previously thought, the latter expressed in questions sprinkled across the songs: “Is this fun? Is this a vibe?” “The fuck am I doing?” “Am I dreaming?” “What’s a guy like me to do?”Wet Leg: Catch These Fists – videoIt means that the kind of barbed put-downs that peppered their debut are thinner on the ground, although there’s a great one on Catch These Fists, a withering dismissal of a would-be suitor in a nightclub: “He don’t get puss, he get the boot / I saw him sipping on Dark Fruit.” And besides, you hardly want for smart, funny lyrics, their power amplified by Teasdale’s hugely expressive voice slipping from singing to speech, from careful enunciation to a chewy drawl, from snarl to wide-eyed gasp. Davina McCall channels a rush of lust through the Big Brother presenter’s catchphrase “I’m coming to get you”; Don’t Speak frames romance through the unlikely metaphor of tortilla chips: “You’re the sand between my toes … We go together like salsa and Doritos.”‘This weird dream just keeps going!’ Wet Leg on overnight success, sexual epiphanies and facing fearsRead moreMusically, it shifts from Pokemon’s synth-y 80s pop rock to the kind of Kate Bush-influenced balladry in which Teasdale dabbled when she was still a singer-songwriter who called herself Babushka Baba Yaga, on 11:21. But its primary currency is early 90s US alt-rock – the ghosts of Pixies, Belly and the Breeders haunt its lurching dynamic shifts and cocktails of sticky pop melodies and raging guitars – and, more unexpectedly, the angular riffs of Elastica, particularly pronounced on Pond Song and Catch These Fists.Indeed, Wet Leg’s influences are never far from the surface of their music and you could argue that all this amounts to yet more canny restructuring of the past in a genre that’s made recycling its business for the last 30 years. But it’s far harder to quibble with the power of the end result. Whatever’s inspired them, the songs are supremely punchy, the tunes contagious: Moisturizer is a blast. One suspects that, for Wet Leg, things will continue to not go quite to plan for some time yet.Moisturizer is released via Domino on 11 JulyExplore more on these topicsWet LegPop and rockIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Few relish the monthly bleeding, cramps and scramble to stock up on tampons that come with themenstrual cycle. Periods are usually greeted by a weary sigh and a search in the knicker drawer for the big black pants. However, a new wave of period underwear is revolutionising the monthly cycle for many.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Period pants act as reusable period protection that absorb blood and can then be put in the washing machine. The general guidance is to change your period pants every four to six hours, but this can vary according to the brand, absorbency rating and the heaviness of your cycle.Some choose period pants for convenience (no need to carry around tampons or pads), but they’re also a sustainable alternative to single-use period products. Disposable sanitary towels contain up to 90% plastic, which ends up – more often than not –as landfill or ocean pollution. In fact, with packaging and adhesive included, each sanitary pad is equivalent to aboutfour plastic bags. So, while energy and water are used to wash period pants, they’re still one of the more eco-friendly menstrual products.“But period pants give me the ick,” said a friend when I mentioned what I’d been testing. Other than the thousand things I could say about the patriarchal shaming of women’s bodies, I answered truthfully: they’re really not that bad.Period pants are absorbent and easy to wash, and if you’re really freaked out by blood, you can put them straight into awet bagbefore they go into the machine. It’s recommended to wash period pants on a cool cycle without softener (since softeners inhibit absorbency) and then air dry rather than tumble. My main takeaway from the test? Period pants are easy to use and (relatively) mess-free.At a glanceBest period pants overall:Wuka stretch midi briefFrom £15.99 a pair at WukaBest budget period pants:Marks & Spencer period full briefs£16 for three pairs at M&SBest period pants for zero VPL:Modibodi seamfree full briefFrom £20.99 a pair at ModibodiBest period pants for overnight:Cheeky Wipes Feeling Cosy bamboo period shorts£16.99 a pair at Cheeky WipesWhy you should trust meI’ve been testing products professionally for more than four years. My mission is to be firm, fair and thorough in my assessment of any product, and I’ve tested many things – from kids’ SPFs to kitchen appliances. This isn’t my first foray into professional period product testing, either: I’ve tested period pads, and know what I’m looking for. Period pants are my personal period product of choice, having tried pretty much every iteration on the market.How I testedView image in fullscreenWater was poured on to the pants to test their absorbency.Photograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianI tested more than 30 different period pants, including high-street retailers’ own brands alongside specialist brands. My testing window lasted three cycles, so about three months. I wore the pants for the recommended time during my period, checking for comfort and leaks. Vitally, I then washed and dried them to see how long this process took; period pants can take a while to dry, particularly because you can’t tumble dry them. In fact, my washing line rarely had space for anything but period pants during testing.After washing I checked if the pants were still in good shape – saggy elastic just won’t do. I also tested their absorbency thoroughly – during my cycle and by pouring volumes of water on to the pants and observing how they coped (timing this for accurate results). Comfort, fit and price were all taken into consideration too.The best period pants you can buy in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianBest period pants overall:Wuka stretch midi briefView image in fullscreenFrom £15.99 a pair at WukaWuka designed these briefs to offer a flexible fit for every body shape. They’re multi-size, which is great for those who experience bloating, are postpartum or are a still-growing teenager. They’re made from stretchy, soft nylon and elastane on the outer and a mix of polyester, polyamide, TPU (a waterproof fabric), cotton and spandex on the inside. The gusset is suspended into the underwear, so it provides a more flexible fit that can accommodate body shape and an active lifestyle.Why we loveitI found the heavy-absorbency pair I tested comfortable to wear, soft and flexible. A lot of period pants shrink in the wash and become uncomfortable, but the elastic never started to dig in, even after more than 10 washes. The suspended gusset meant I felt secure during testing and didn’t experience any leaks. And despite offering very good absorbency – absorbing 30ml of water in 46 seconds during testing – the Wuka isn’t bulky, with a shape and style substantial enough to give you peace of mind without looking like something Bridget Jones would wear. Wuka doesn’t use silver or antibacterial treatments in the production of its pants, if you’re concerned about thepotential health risks.It’s a shame that …they come in only two colours (Wuka claims not to be a fashion brand, so only offers pants in black and beige).Size range:6-26Absorbencies available:medium, heavy, superB Corp:yesBest budgetperiod pants:Marks & Spencer period full briefsView image in fullscreen£16 for three pairs at M&SM&Sentered the period pants gamein 2021 and now has awide range. These heavy-absorbency knickers were tested as they’re middle of the road in terms of absorbency, cut and price – they’re a versatile option and will probably suit most people. A set of three is roughly the same price as one pair of period pants from a specialist brand. There are three colours in the pack I tested: pink, burgundy and beige. They’re made from 83% cotton, 9% polyamide and 8% elastane and can be washed at 40C.Why we love itSwitching to period pants can, initially, be expensive, even though the swap will save you money over time. This set of three from M&S makes the switch more achievable by being a relatively affordable option. A realistic estimate is thatdisposable period products cost about £10 a month, so £120 a year. If you bought six pairs of these M&S period pants, that would cost you £32, and they should last up to three years. That’s a saving of at least £300.Many period pants are slippery nylon, while these feel refreshingly like standard cotton briefs. They offered a decent level of coverage without reaching up over my tummy button (no shade to big-pants fans, but they’re not for everyone). M&S rates these as heavy absorbency, but I found they were best for mid-flow days – I had two slight leaks on heavier days. However, they were comfy without much bulk, washed well and retained their colour. I also enjoyed that they came in colours other than black and beige (yawn).It’s a shame that …they shrank slightly after a few washes at 40C.Size range:8-24Absorbencies available:heavyB Corp:noBest period pants for zero VPL:Modibodi seamfree full briefView image in fullscreenFrom £20.99 a pair at Modibodi£24.99 a pair at John LewisModibodi’s comfortable, seamless period pants are a little more bouji than your average, with a top layer of merino wool on the gusset, a material renowned for its soft, moisture-wicking and breathable properties. Underneath this layer is a towel ofpolyester and polyamide, then a third layer of polyester. Shape-wise, there’s a low-leg and high-waist cut for comfort.Why we loveitThese are good if you’re worried about bulky period pants and want to wear something close-fitting. They’re seamfree and are glued instead of sewn. Plus, the absorbent gusset is relatively small – it doesn’t stretch up to the waistband at the front or back, reducing thickness significantly.I found the moderate-absorbency pair comfortable to wear (although I suggest you cut out the huge, chunky and very itchy label). The silky recycled nylon and elastane on the outer gave a good amount of stretch on bloated days, and this elasticity didn’t seem to dissolve after the first five washes. I also found the pants dried quickly, on the washing lineandheated airer. Modibodi claims the merino wool helps reduce odours – I certainly felt fresh and clean wearing them, even on heavy-flow days.It’s a shame that …you need to wash them on a cold cycle, which means you can’t throw them in with your standard laundry.Size range:8-26Absorbencies available:moderate, superB Corp:yesBest period pants for overnight:Cheeky Wipes Feeling Cosy bamboo period shortsView image in fullscreen£16.99 a pair at Cheeky WipesFor maximum coverage and comfort while sleeping, these Cheeky Wipes period shorts are up there with the best. With a high waistline, comfortable low leg that doesn’t cut off the blood supply and ultra-soft, breathable bamboo fabric, these shorts are a triple threat. The absorbency coverage is front to back, with a generous four-layered gusset to ensure you can sleep in every position with peace of mind.Why we loveitEasily the most comfortable period pants I tried, these were a joy to sleep in. Even on the heaviest flow, I suffered no leaks and felt dry and fresh all night long. The long absorbency area is doing its job here. I upped the ante and tested 30ml of water poured out over 10 seconds, and the period pants absorbed all the liquid within 40 seconds. I found the bamboo soft against my skin, and breathable – perfect for those liable to overheating during the night.Washing and drying were fuss-free, too. The care instructions suggest 30C or lower, and they came out fresh with the colour still vibrant. These Cheeky Wipes products don’t contain perfluorooctane sulfonate (Pfos), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or silver.It’s a shame that …they’re not more aesthetically pleasing (it’s comfort over style here).Size range:2-30Absorbencies available:heavyB Corp:application pendingThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianBodyform ComfortFit Essentials Brazilian period pantsView image in fullscreen£13.32 a pair at Bodyformskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The light-absorbency pair I tested were pretty bog-standard, but a decent option for lighter-flow days. I wouldn’t trust them with a heavy flow, however, and I don’t fancy their chances with clots. That said, they’re lightweight and flexible, and the most like wearing a pair of normal cotton knickers of all the period pants I tried.The main part of the pants is 95% cotton, which makes them feel soft. I also liked how breathable they were. The gusset itself is less breathable – two layers made up of polyester, elastane and polyamide. Full disclosure: these pants are infused with silver copper zeolite for keeping bacteria at bay.They didn’t make the cut because …I felt there were better period pants out there for the same price.Size range:4-22;absorbencies available:light, moderate, heavy;B Corp:noNixi The Coni period pantsView image in fullscreen£22 a pair at Nixi Body£22 a pair at BootsBest for:gym bunnies and the fashion-consciousI was immediately struck by how lightweight these period pants are: they’re some of the most flimsy I tried, but I was still impressed with the absorbency of the light-flow pair I tested. There are four layers of polyester, elastane, nylon and cotton in the absorbency zone. While the Coni is definitely best once your heaviest flow is over – the gusset has a relatively scant surface area – I was able to wear them on mid-flow days and forget I was on my period.These period pants are designed for zero VPL and have a feminine cut with scalloped edging that lies flat against your bum. This means they stay close to your body, and can’t be seen under tight gym leggings and cycling shorts.They didn’t make the final cut because …they’re not super breathable (and could be rather sweaty at the gym).Size range:8-30;absorbencies available:light,medium;B Corp:noCheeky Wipes Feeling Free boy-brief-style period pantsView image in fullscreen£12.99 a pair at Cheeky WipesBest for:teensCheeky Wipes says it has designed these period pants with teens in mind, and they certainly felt like the most teen-friendly to me during testing. They come in a cheery leopard print – easy to find in the laundry and knicker drawer. And even more importantly, they offer great coverage without being bulky. The cut is similar to the pants younger teens are used to, and they should be absorbent enough to last them a whole school day.The pants have a front-to-back absorbency zone with three layers – super-absorbent microfibre is doing most of the work here. During testing they performed brilliantly – I tried them with 15ml of water poured on them over five seconds, and all the liquid had been absorbed within seven seconds. They also washed well without dulling the colours.The cut, a low-rise boy brief, is comfortable and will give peace of mind to teens getting to grips with their monthly cycle. I was really impressed by the quality of these period pants for the price – encouragingly affordable for the parents of still-growing teenagers.They didn’t make the final cut because …as fun as they are, the bright print might not be for everyone.Size range:4-24;absorbencies available:medium;B Corp:application pendingWuka Ultimate midi-brief period pantsView image in fullscreenFrom £22.99 a pair at WukaBest for:heavy periodsThe super-absorbency Wuka period pants are the pair I reached for on the heaviest days of my period during testing, and they did me proud – even overnight. Wuka claims they can be worn for up to 24 hours. My own internal ick factor prevented me from testing them for quite this long, but I felt reasonably fresh after a day of wear. As these are Wuka’s belt-and-braces offering, the pad inside the gusset is thicker than on the cheaper medium version, with two layers of absorbent fabric and waterproofing. The absorbency zone stretches front to back, too. Despite all this coverage, I didn’t find them noticeably bulky – if you like to wear tight clothing, they might show a little, but I found them fine in jeans.They washed well, too. I had to unravel the absorbency layer a bit after washing, but it quickly returned to its shape. Despite being washed about nine times during testing, they still look as good as new, with springy elastic. Be warned, though: they do take a long time to dry, so don’t rely on them being clean and ready to use again in a 24-hour time frame.They didn’t make the final cut because …at full price, they’re quite pricey compared with the other period pants here, and they take a while to dry.Size range:4-26;absorbencies available:medium, heavy, super, overnight;B Corp: yesWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Zoë Phillimore/The GuardianHow much should I spend on period pants?An immediate switch to using only period pants can be a hit to your bank balance: many period pants cost about £15 a pair (although you can get cheaper packs, such as the M&S set reviewed above) and you’ll need to change pants every four to six hours (depending on the brand, absorbency and flow). A phased switchover is more manageable: invest in enough for a few days of your period, and make sure you’re organised about washing and drying them. Bear in mind that a high price point doesn’t necessarily mean a better product, however.What should I look out for with period pants?The main things to consider are shape and absorbency level. Many of us want good, secure coverage during our period – but some of us want pants that look good too. Go for a style that suits you and your flow. You can often get the same style with different levels of absorbency.How long can you wear period pants?Typically, you can wear period pants for four to six hours, but you’re going to know your flow and comfort levels the best. Overnight period pants are designed to be worn longer. Most period pants have an absorbency rating listed on the product (which I’ve provided above), although there’s no universal standard so your idea of a heavy flow may be different to others’.You’ll know when to change your period pants when they start to feel a bit heavy, or you can feel dampness. A sure sign is when you get spotting on your clothes – but ideally you’d change your period pants before this.If you’re out and about, you might want to take a dedicatedwet bag(a waterproof fabric bag) with you – they’re made for the job, and are discreet. Pop your period pants into one until you can get to a washing machine. You might want to rinse them under the cold tap until the water runs clear before chucking them in the washing machine, but if that’s not possible just make sure to wash them as soon as you can.Are period pants actually more eco-friendly than disposable sanitary items?Yes, period pants are thought to be more eco-friendly than disposable period products overall. “The most up-to-date evidence – including a life-cycle assessment of menstrual products – suggests that when it comes to environmental impact, the menstrual cup comes out on top, followed by period underwear and then reusable pads,” says Helen Lynn, senior consultant and research fellow at theWomen’s Environmental Network. “This major international studycomparing different period products across eight environmental indicators found that menstrual cups – which are small, reusable and can last up to 10 years – had the lowest impact across the board. Period underwear came in second, then reusable pads. Single-use pads and tampons came in last.”It’s worth pointing out that while menstrual cups have the least impact,knowing how to properly insert a menstrual cup is essential, as is regular sterilising.Should I be worried about silver in period pants?Some period pants use “antimicrobial silver” woven into the fibre to reduce odour and bacteria. And as the Guardian reported,one study has found that silver in period pants may pose a health risk. If you’re concerned by this, opt for period pants that are silver-free – there are plenty on the market.Zoë Phillimore is ajournalist with 20 years of experience.

Sign up hereNatricia DuncanWed 9 Jul 2025 07.28 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 07.29 EDTShareHello and welcome to The Long Wave. I’m Natricia Duncan, the Guardian’s Caribbean correspondent, based in Jamaica. I’m taking over this week to focus on the sticky subject of migration between the UK and the Caribbean, how young people on both sides of the pond are connecting to heal old wounds, and whyBarbadosis inviting its diaspora to come home.Since the HMT Empire Windrush cruised into Tilbury Docks, Essex, in June 1948, laden with the dreams and aspirations of people in search of a better life, there has been a constant flow of migrants from the Caribbean to the UK.Despite suffering venomous xenophobia from a British population largely unprepared or unwilling to accommodate the influx of Black migrants, Caribbean people kept coming. Many believed they were going to a better place, from which others had returned seemingly transformed – haloed by the mystery of the faraway kingdom, their accents refined and their bank accounts enriched.By 2021, more than 1.1 million people living in the UK identified as Caribbean,according to that year’s census. And, today, people in Caribbean islands – where economies have been crippled by the lasting legacy of transatlantic slavery and colonialism, and hampered by an increasing number of catastrophic natural disasters due to the climate emergency – continue to seek a better life in the UK.They haven’t been deterred by the Windrush scandal, which saw Caribbean people wrongly detained and threatened with deportation or actually deported, or by the persistence of negative attitudes towards immigration in the UK. Research published earlier this year by theMigration Observatoryrevealed that 52% of people polled want immigration reduced and 32% think immigration is a “bad or very bad thing”.A Caribbean cultural exchangeView image in fullscreen‘Sharing cultural heritage’ … Windrush I Accelerator participants in Barbados.Photograph: Ella CampbellWhen I spoke to 22-year-old Tia Corbin, a student at the University of the West Indies in Barbados, it was clear that many people still have a powerful aspiration to travel to more developed countries. “I know a lot of my peers and colleagues desperately want an opportunity to travel to somewhere else – and to stay,” she said.Corbin was recently part of the Windrush I Accelerator, an annual social enterprise project that aims to connect people from the Caribbean diaspora to their roots. It involves UK university students with Caribbean heritage travelling to the region to work with their counterparts to explore how they can combine their skills, heritage, technology and AI to solve some of the Caribbean’s pressing social and economic problems.This year’s cohort of students flew to Barbados. Frances Trought, the project’s founder, said students in the programme created “solutions which can add to the economic benefit of both the UK and the Caribbean, and to the sharing of cultural heritage”.Participant Olivia Howell, 20, a social anthropology student at the University of Birmingham, whose grandparents are Jamaican and Cuban, said she was attracted to the programme because she felt as if the Caribbean culture in her community was disappearing.“I’m part of an antiracism group in Birmingham, and we were discussing how we’ve seen the decline of certain Caribbean spaces, like, for instance, Saturday schools and the carnival in Handsworth [in Birmingham],” she said. In recent times, Caribbean culture has often been linked to negative issues such as the Windrush scandal. “I really want to see more positive aspects, focused on celebrating culture, on economic opportunities.”Corbin, who wants to study and work outside Barbados, said the programme expanded her options: “It exposed me to all the things I could possibly accomplish here in Barbados and elsewhere.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Born in Birmingham, UK, he was moved to Barbados in 1970 at age six. “My parents wanted to get my sister and me out of England due to, I’ll be very blunt, racism,” he said. “They felt that we would have better chances in terms of education and being in a society that accepts us for who we are.”Connecting the current generations of students in the UK and Caribbean “is going to be perfect for building new relationships between the region and Britain as we go forward”, he told me.“Some of the students in this programme may very well go on to be the next set of politicians within the region and in the UK,” he said. “If they form relationships now, it makes it much easier for them to do business in the future and to build some bridges which have been broken because of incidents like the Windrush situation, racism and all the other things that keep us apart. It gives these young people the opportunity to become that bridge that we need to move forward as global partners.”The programme, King added, also complements theBarbados government’s We Gatherin’ initiative, which, among other goals, aims to “deepen the connection between Barbados and its diaspora”.“There is 166 square miles of love waiting for you in Barbados,” King said to those who feel displaced. “You don’t have to be in London or Europe if you don’t want to be, because there is a place called the Caribbean to open its doors to you.”To receive the complete version of The Long Wave in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsBarbadosThe Long WavenewslettersShareReuse this content"

I remember, pretty much every day after school from the age of five, coming home and putting on Eleanor Rigby, because I loved the storytelling.

Before I knew it, my legs developed a mind of their own, my shoulders got involved and my jaw was chewingWed 9 Jul 2025 12.56 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 13.24 EDTShareBy the time I got into Cardiff Central just before 8am on Friday, the early birds of theOasisflock were already arriving. With a full 12 hours to go until showtime, this wasn’t a bad effort. Respect. I wasn’t there for the big reunion concert. I’d have liked to have been going, but I couldn’t face the hassle. If a ticket package had been available which transported me to my seat, à la Star Trek, just before the gig started, and then transported me straight to bed when the curtain came down, I would have paid handsomely for it. As it was, I enjoyed bystanding, breathing in the thick air of anticipation, like a kind of passive smoker, detached yet vaguely intoxicated by it all.I was there to present my radio programme from BBC Wales, just across the way from the station. My studio afforded me a view of the crowds thickening outside. I wanted to scoff at all the blokes of my vintage wearing age-inappropriate bucket hats, and the rampant money-making at the heart of it all. But it was all too moving seeing these people getting reacquainted with their 20-years-ago selves. And as for the Gallagher brothers, hell, money has driven many families apart – so what if in this instance, it’s money that has brought them back together?I spotted a lad in a Man City top who can’t have been born when Oasis started out. He was doing theLiam Gallagherwalk. You know the one: a kind of extreme swagger, with exaggerated shoulder movement and feet oriented outwards, gum being chewed. Sweet. Daft, but sweet.And then I noticed that nearly everyone was, to a lesser or greater extent, doing the Liam walk. Young and old alike had their shoulders moving more than usual, their feet angled outwards by as many degrees as they could manage and their jaws a-chewing. This walk is seen as a Manchester thing, but I don’t know if it was Manchester that gave it to Liam, or Liam who gave it to Manchester. Either way, geography didn’t seem to matter, the whole seething congregation was at it. I’m not even sure it was a conscious thing; people’s bodies just seemed to start moving in this way. It was obviously infectious. Everyone’s attitude, bluster, arrogance – call it what you will – was elevated.

He said that there are specific walks for specific occasions, and this was merely the going-to-an-Oasis-gig way. Another example, James said, was the walking-to-a-football-match walk. And he’s right, there is something brisk, purposeful but vaguely trepidatious about the gait of a football fan heading to the ground. Heading away from the ground after the match is a different matter. Then it is result dependent. Winners and losers walk different walks.Other gaits spring to mind. There is the not especially purposeful and somewhat untidy way that kids the world over make their way to school. The leisurely, hands-behind-back progress of aged Italian gents taking their post-prandial stroll. The erect, staring-straight-ahead stride of beautiful people, their facial expressions communicating something along the lines of: “Yes. Gorgeous, aren’t I? Don’t blame you for staring but, just to be clear, I’m way out of your league.” I’ve become a gait connoisseur. There really are so many to celebrate.I finished my radio show at lunchtime and made my way back to Cardiff Central to get out of town and leave the Oasis hordes to it. And sure enough, even during that short walk through the throng, my legs developed minds of their own. I watched my feet splay outwards towards the 10 o’clock and 2 o’clock. My shoulders soon joined in, and before I knew it I was chewing, even though there was nothing in my mouth to chew. Yes, I too was doing the Liam walk.

Now, the IDF is posting Facebook ads for bulldozer operators to help demolish the stripWed 9 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 12.31 EDTShareOmer Bartov is an Israeli-American historian and one of the foremost scholars on genocide in the world. He has spent over 25 years teaching a class on the subject. He deals with atrocities for a living, analyzing some of the very worst things that human beings are capable of. And yet even Bartov has said he can’t bear looking at some of the excruciating images coming out of Gaza any more.What’s happening, Bartov says, is unprecedented in the 21st century. “I don’t know of any comparable situation. Recent estimates show that about 70% of the structures inGazaare either completely destroyed or severely damaged,” Bartov says. “The argument that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is conducting a war in Gaza is simply cynical, there is no war in Gaza. What the IDF is doing in Gaza is demolishing it. Hundreds of buildings are being bulldozed every week. This is not a secret, but mainstream media coverage has been insufficient.”Part of the reason that mainstream coverage has been insufficient is because reporting about what’s happening in Gaza is difficult:foreign reportersare still not allowed into Gaza to see what is happening for themselves and Israel is slaughtering Palestinian journalists on the ground. I feel like I’m screaming into the void every time I repeat some version of that sentence and yet there still seems to be apathy about this assault on press freedom from some of my colleagues in the mainstream media.As Bartov said, despite the lack of coverage, the systematic destruction of Gaza is hardly a secret. Indeed, the Israeli military is so desperate for extra bulldozers that, over the last couple of months, there have beenads for bulldozer driversto help demolish Gaza posted on Facebook – some apparently offering as much as 3,000 shekels ($882) a day for the work. I found around a dozen of these ads on Meta since the end of May, many of them on a public Facebook page for bulldozer operators. Meanwhile aHaaretz articlefrom this week looking into the outsourcing of bulldozer drivers found that they are paid per building: 2,500 shekels for the demolition of a small building, 5,000 shekels for a large building.“The idea that the bulldozer has become a major article of genocide and warfare is quite new,” says Neve Gordon, a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London. “What is happening in Gaza is not a building here or there being demolished; it’s the destruction of whole villages and towns.”Also new is the outsourcing of bulldozer drivers. “The Israeli military usually does not work in this way,” says Gordon. “It can sequester bulldozers and draft the drivers as reserve soldiers.”Reports from Israeli outletsshow that the IDF is facing a shortage of drivers and is recruiting civilians for military operations in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon. “I would consider this as a form of ‘outsourcing demolitions’ used to advance a genocidal project,” Gordon says.International law doesn’t seem to hold much weight any more, but is the wholesale bulldozing of villages and neighbourhoods in Gaza legal?International law doesn’t seem to hold much weight any more, but is the wholesale bulldozing of villages and neighbourhoods in Gaza legal? Gordon says it isn’t. “If military necessity requires bulldozing a civilian house, you might find arguments for bulldozing. But if a village or neighbourhood is bulldozed, as we see throughout Gaza, then it is a flagrant violation.“The problem is that the law doesn’t look at the whole picture, it looks at the event and whether that’s illegal or not.” If during hostilities a sniper is on the roof of a civilian’s home, for example, you can target that house, provided you abide by legal principles such as proportionality and precaution. But you can only target it at that moment; you can’t target it because there’s a possibility that a sniper might use it in the future.”Gordon notes that Israel’s argument for the extensive bulldozing is that any civilian home is potentially an entrance or shield for military tunnels underneath the strip. However, says Gordon: “the international community doesn’t rate these arguments”. Particularly as Israel has been caught lying about certain things multiple times now: “They told us for months that Hamas’s headquarters were under al-Shifa hospital [which was once Gaza’s biggest medical complex].” No such headquarters was ever found.And here’s the crucial thing, Gordon says: “In order to determine if Israel’s claims have any basis, you need an independent investigation. You need to let in an investigative team. Israel isn’t allowing that.” You can draw your own conclusions as to why that is.Meta isn’t just hosting posts looking for bulldozer drivers. Gordon notes it’s also been platforming videos by a bulldozer driver,Rabbi Avraham Zarbiv, who promotes what Gordon describes as “illegal military operations and violence involving the destruction of civilian homes and infrastructure in Gaza”. Zarbiv glorifies the destruction of Gaza with bulldozers as a new way of fighting which saves Israeli lives, says Gordon.After I flagged one of Zarbiv’s videos to Meta, it was taken down. However, the ads (which areFacebookposts rather than paid advertisements) looking for bulldozer operators in Gaza are still up. Meta declined to provide any specific comments on these but directed me to their various policies about what sort of content is allowed on their platform. One presumes this means they are allowed.Governments like mine have a duty to stand up to Israel. Far too many have failed | Gustavo PetroRead moreWhile that may be Meta’s interpretation, they seem to be on somewhat shaky ground with these posts. “Ads that seek to employ people for jobs that require them to participate in and/or support acts that can constitute incitement to violence and may contribute to the commission of international crimes would be unlawful,” Gordon says.Dr John Reynolds, associate professor at the School of Law and Criminology at Maynooth University in Ireland, similarly notes that “there’s grounds to say this could be a form of aiding/facilitating war crimes in violation of international humanitarian law, a form of propaganda for war in violation of human rights law, and potentially also in conflict with the duty to prevent genocide, which is primarily a responsibility of states but can also be applied to corporations”.All this bulldozing comes with a very clear end goal. “Israeli government officials and media have made [their plans] fairly public,” says Bartov, who, like many other respected scholars, characterises what is happening in Gaza as a genocide. “What they appear to be aiming for – and are in the process of implementing – is for the IDF to take over roughly 75% of the Gaza Strip and demolish it entirely, with bombs and bulldozers, many of which are massive D9s recently imported from the US. The goal seems to be to concentrate the entire Gazan population into the remaining 25% of the territory, in the al-Mawasi area, and to debilitate them to the extent that they either flee, are permitted to leave or simply wither away.”I had this conversation with Bartov a few weeks ago. Now lawmakers are being even more brazen about their plans: defence minister Israel Katz has said they plan to concentrate people in Gaza into an internment camp on the rubble of Rafah.Meanwhile, western governments and big tech companies like Meta seem happy to not just let all this happen, but to facilitate it. The revolution may not be televised, but genocide is certainly getting privatized.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsraelFacebookWar crimesPalestinian territoriesMetaSocial networkingcommentShareReuse this content"

My own journey showed me how to helpFran BoaitWe need to confront the social conditions that impact them – and the toxic workplaces they’re trying to push back againstWed 9 Jul 2025 05.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTShareLast month, new figures showed thatone in four young people in Englandhave a mental health condition. An unwillingness to examine the challenging social and economic conditions – from housing insecurity to financial concerns – means there can be a tendency to explain this rise as a result of overdiagnosis, although there is little evidence for this claim. Clinicians cite the criteria for diagnosis to show that overreporting isnot substantiated– if anything, the severity of reported conditions has increased, in part due to a reduced stigma resulting in more people seeking help.Young people with poor mental health arenearly five timesmore likely to be out of work, and there is a growing understanding that inadequate support around young people’s mental health in the workplace is driving them toleave or consider leaving their job. In response, the government has proposed cuts tounder-22s’ health support.While there isn’t evidence that removing financial support motivates people back to work, there are things we can change to make workplaces healthier environments – and, for the times when things are not OK, for poor mental health to be accommodated and supported.Too often workplaces default to fear, competition, “everyone out for themselves” attitudes and poor trust between colleagues. In this context it’s dangerous to admit to struggling with your mental health, and there is still a tendency to see these struggles as a diversion from the norm rather than as a normal part of the human experience. Our mental health is also hugely affected by the social, economic and political conditions in modern society.A lot can happen during our working life. Maybe a parent gets sick, we have caring responsibilities, we suffer an unexpected loss or financial difficulties: these can all trigger difficulties in our mental health. Alongside life events, persistent structuralracism,classismandableismtake their toll. Having a workplace that recognises these factors – normalising all mental health struggles whether there is an immediate reason or not – can be important to being able to stay in work. A both rewarding and sad moment for me in my last few months of being a director at an NGO was a relatively new employee saying: “I know I can get sick here and it would be OK.” He had previously worked at another organisation where, when sick leave was taken, it would implicitly be viewed as an inconvenience to the rest of the team.There is no shortage of people unhappy with their boss – in factstress at work is the norm, and people who have a positive relationship with their workplace are in the minority. The UK has the highest percentage of workers globally who say theywouldn’t work at allif money were no object, with stressful working conditions cited as the main reason. There aren’t just bad apples – something is wrong with the way we organise our places of work. Since society individualises behaviour and managers’ or bosses’ flaws, there is no collective diagnosis for what’s going wrong or how to improve workplace culture and leadership, and raise the bar to a healthier level for what’s OK.Young people are the first cohort to push back against this. They aredemanding morefrom their workplace. This is part of a generational shift that is well under way: my four-year-old is taught emotional literacy at nursery and at home, taught to understand his full range of emotions and not to feel shame around them, while his grandparents’ generation is still stuck in the mindset that negative emotions such as sadness or anger are problematic and to be avoided and suppressed rather than understood. Against this backdrop, we should be seeing young people’s struggles with mental health as an invitation to understand not only their situation and context, but also our own.People in 20s more likely to be out of work because of poor mental health than those in early 40sRead moreTo really undo the ableist concepts around mental health we absorb every day in society, often we need to have our own experience or to deeply empathise with someone close to us. For me, it was my own journey with depression while leading an NGO that forced me to rethink some of my beliefs. First it took me a long time to acknowledge and admit I was depressed. My internal view of myself didn’t allow it to register until a colleague and a friend, both of whom I admired, shared their experiences of depression with me. As I learned to manage my own struggle, I became kinder towards myself and shifted how I led. I was less controlling and more able to let go of things more easily. It became clear to me that it’s not only possible but preferable for high-performing teams to have a culture of care. Showing understanding for others’ situations is an important foundation for then being able to ask people to take responsibility for their own needs and the needs of their role.While I was director we implemented policies and best practices we learned from other organisations, such as the use of aduvet day, when you could take time off without warning if you felt you needed a day in bed – a way of normalising taking days off for poor mental health. Getting the balance right isn’t always straightforward, and there is an ongoing need for self-reflection and accountability.Part of what young people need in order to navigate their difficulties are emotionally mature adults who have their back and who want to understand root causes. What they often get are impatient older generations who think they are complaining too much.

Targeting issues like housing, personal debt and mental health will get people into work and cut the benefits billWed 9 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 12.44 EDTShareOne consequence of the recent debate on disability benefits should be the acceptance of a shared responsibility across the Labour family to support the government with alternative approaches to welfare reform. Here inGreater Manchester, where there was strong opposition to the cuts, we accept our responsibility entirely.As clear as the case is for some form of wealth taxation, it would be wrong to make that the only response. The Department for Work and Pensions system didn’t work for people before last week’s debate and it still doesn’t now. What is needed is a unifying version of reform, and we think we can help with that.With a decade of devolution behind us, Greater Manchester is ready to step forward as the UK’s first “prevention demonstrator”, showing how we can prevent poor outcomes for residents and rising costs of public services. We are proud to have received that official designation from the government in the 10-year health plan forEngland, and we are confident we can live up to it.Benefit cuts will hit severely disabled people despite ministers’ claims, say charitiesRead moreThe time has come to break with Whitehall business as usual and build an entirely new model of support. One of the many problems with Whitehall’s approach to welfare reform is trying to solve the complex issue of getting more people into work from within the narrow policy silo of the DWP when, in truth, the answers are much more likely to lie outside.This is where Greater Manchester starts. We recognise that the barriers to work our residents face are often linked to issues like housing, personal debt and mental health. Consequently, a whole-person, whole-system approach is the only one that stands any chance of working. This is the philosophy upon which our prevention demonstrator is based – a bottom-up, names-not-numbers approach to supporting people with the essentials needed for a good life. At its heart are three big ideas which we believe, if carried out to their fullest extent, could together score the savings the Office for Budget Responsibility needs to see, as well as financing the removal ofthe two-child benefit cap.Whereas the Whitehall version of reform focuses on people, and crude cuts to headline rates of support, ours begins with bricks and mortar. I am stunned by the extent to which the media debate on benefits underplays the impact of the housing crisis. It inflates the benefits bill by multiple billions – but is also entirely fixable.The new Greater Manchester strategy, published today, is anchored on the idea of a “housing first” city region. Without the foundation of a good home, everything in life becomes more difficult for our residents. From now on, housing will be recognised as pre-eminent in public policy. Freeing our city region from the grip of the housing crisis will be our number one priority.What does that mean in practice? It means, for instance, reaching a new tipping point within two to three years of building more social homes than we are losing, alongside a much tougher approach to improving standards in the private rented sector through our newgood landlord charter.In an ideal world, we would go much further. The vast majority of the£39bn announced for housingat last month’s spending review should be focused on a drive to build a new generation of council homes, rather than subsidise private housing. The evidence is compelling. A 2024 study for the National Housing Federation, carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, found that building 90,000 new social homes would save £3.3bn a year in universal credit over the long term. If the government worked with England’s mayors and councils to scale that number up to 500,000, then the recurrent annual saving to the benefits system gets closer to £18bn.Building on this new approach to housing, the second part of our prevention demonstrator involves a paradigm shift in employment support, moving away from a distrustful, tick-box system and towards a more empowering Live Well approach.How is a system which people fear having contact with, and often leaves them feeling worse about themselves, ever going to help them into work? The answer is it won’t. Years of tough-on-benefits rhetoric has created a system which people see as being there to trip them up rather than help them out.To those who question what Labour stands for – look at Best Start. It will change Britain’s future | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe only answer is to turn it on its head. We must start with places people trust at a local level, such as community and voluntary organisations, and with the issues in people’s lives that are the true barriers to work. This is the essence of Live Well. We know there are thousands of people in Greater Manchester who have completely disengaged from the DWP but, if helped in a different way and particularly with issues that are destructive to their mental health like personal debt, could be supported into work.Our third focus is young people. The appalling statistic of 1 million people not in education, employment or training stands as a damning monument to an education system in England built for some young people but not all. The obsession with the university route, and the failure to provide equal technical paths, leaves many teenagers feeling lost in the middle years of secondary school. Our plan for the Greater Manchester baccalaureate, or Mbacc, seeks to fix that with the guarantee of a 45-day work placement for every young person who wants one.We are confident our prevention demonstrator, in its entirety, could significantly reduce reliance on the benefits system and other public services like the NHS. We have never truly tried prevention in this country. If there was ever a time to give it a proper go, surely it is now?Andy Burnham is the mayor of Greater Manchester.

That’s what made the horror in Texas so visceralEmma BrockesCamps are a rite of passage for American parents and children. That’s why the tragedy at Camp Mystic was intimately imaginableWed 9 Jul 2025 10.15 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 14.42 EDTShareAmong the many dreams that the US offers its citizens, there’s this: that the American child, around the age of eight, will go to sleep-away camp a few hours from home and begin one of the key formative experiences of their life. They will return every summer. They will learn independence. They will form bonds with people who will one day godparent their children. As an adult, a friend of mine – no kidding – returned to the hallowed ground in Pennsylvania where her summer camp once stood, bought a piece of land and built a house there. Whenever we visited, she’d point out the ruins of the old dining hall down by the lake and get a haunted look on her face.I mention this because, among the many devastated reactions to the flash floods inTexaslast week, there is one that is particular, and particularly acute, to millions of Americans: a gut-level blow of unfathomable loss striking at an experience many consider to be sacred.There’s no real equivalent to these kinds of summer camps in Britain. But for 26 million American kids each year, going to camp is indistinguishable from summer itself. And as with Camp Mystic on thebanks of the Guadalupe River, where 27 campers and staff werekilled by the floods, many have been going for long enough to be attended by generations of the same family. In a country relatively short on long-range tradition, summer camp is right up there.As a result, as news of the floods started to break last weekend, there was a frenzy of communication between parents across the country, many of whom had dropped their own kids off at camp the previous week. “Unimaginable” was the word bouncing around on the text chains, but what made this disaster so horrific is that, for many Americans, the scene at Camp Mystic was intimately imaginable.You knew the excitement and nerves of the youngest children being dropped off for the first time; you could see, in your mind’s eye, the camp director, mirrored wrap-around sunglasses balanced on top of his baseball cap, marshalling cars stuffed with gear to their cabins. These camps, many of which have been running for more than 100 years, run like clockwork. You could put the American Camp Association in charge of the US military and it would probablydo just fine. The idea of any evil befalling your child at summer camp is, in the minds of many Americans, more remote than something happening to them at school.Still, as an outsider, when my own kids got within age range two years ago, I was instinctively hostile to the whole thing. It seemed cultish. Seeing your child off to be minded by a bunch of untested 18-year-olds from Europe and Australia, brought in via a visa loophole, seemed nuts. The closest experience I’d had in my own childhood was a week at Brownie camp, and I’d hated every second of it.This wasn’t, I knew, how many of my American friends felt. Immortalised in movies likeThe Parent Trapand books like Meg Wolitzer’s coming of age novelThe Interestings, camp is where they first discovered their tribes – in the close-knit Jewish camps of the north-east; in the arts and theatre camps and the YMCA camp network, to which my own kids (after launching a campaign to persuade me) would themselves end up going. No tech, no phone calls, basically no laundry. Up at 7.30am and lights out at 9pm. A “bucolic” camp in rural New Jersey that was also my personal nightmare: in a wood, on a lake, where there werebear drillsand snapping turtles and the occasional snake, plus no air conditioning, and – ugh – group fun.And I was wrong, as it turned out. At eight years old, my kids did two weeks at camp and a year later, before we left the US for good, they lobbied to be allowed back for three. Their half-brother, two years their senior, was already pulling down the full two months at his camp up in the Berkshires. And while it won’t be the defining experience of their lives, when they’re 50 I have a feeling they’ll still be talking, occasionally, about camp – not the friends they made, but the even more delicious experience of making a sworn enemy, a kid from New Jersey who furthered the opinion that New York is full of “crusty rats”.It inoculated them against other failures of nerve and made change seem not just survivable but fun. In other words – and as American parents this week consider in light of the full horror in Texas, where stories of what happened at Camp Mystic continue to unfold – it seemed to contain within it a promise of the future.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsTexas floods 2025OpinionTexasChildrenSummer CampParents and parentingcommentShareReuse this content"

The Limmat is so clear that it almost begs you not only to jump in, but to drink it.Paris’s Canal Saint-Martin has never produced either desire in me – but sweltering in last week’s 38C heat, I wanted to close my eyes, pretend it was the Limmat, and leap. Others weren’t so hesitant; there was a line of people going up one of the footbridges over the canal waiting for their turn to jump, dive, backflip or just belly-flop into the water.As the climate crisis throws its destructive effects ever more fully in our faces, cities during heatwaves are their own type of ground zero. It’s no secret that Paris lacks green space and tree cover, ranking at the bottom ofMIT’s Green View index. Last week especially, I found myself longing for the expansive green lawns of Parc Montsouris – along with its free, public sparkling water fountain (one of 17across the city).With the sidewalks sizzling and the sweat dripping, how can we create more green spaces and more tolerable streets inadensely populated city, with housing stock so susceptible to increasingly intense summer heat?View image in fullscreenThis green wall near Sentier Métro station in Paris shelters almost 250 species of plants.Photograph: Apaydin Alain/ABACA/REX/ShutterstockThe answer seems to be to squeeze in bits of vegetation and traffic-calming measures wherever possible. Agreen wallnear Sentier Métro station; bushes, trees, flowers and wildgrasses in former parking spots onRue de Sully; the pedestrianisation ofRue Charles Moureuin the 13th arrondissement, andhundreds morestreets like them to come. There is the “urban forest” growing in front of Paris’s city hall, which is the capital’s third so far, after the 470 trees that replaced a torpid stretch of concrete and sun atPlace de Catalogne, and arepurposing of old railway tracksin the 20th arrondissement.On Sunday, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo,inaugurated her infamous pledgeto make the Seine swimmable again for the first time in a century. You might call it a gimmick, though thereareParisians excited to take the plunge.While none of these localised urban tweaks are a substitute for big-picture political action to tackle the climate crisis, we will need to use every adaptation available to make our cities tolerable in the face of extreme heat. Whether it is swimmable ponds or little pockets of shaded respite, these things all help.Here inParis, for example, they are redoing an intersection near my apartment that is also home to a small square. Previously, everything was paved in heat-absorbing blacktop; now, the blacktop has been replaced with stone, which does a better job reflecting the sun, and half of the formerly paved surface area has been planted. The visual improvement is already incontrovertible, and in a few years, when the plants have grown to their full size, what was once a heat island will have been transformed into something far cooler and more convivial.Hidalgo’s strategy hasn’t been without its critics, but from the pedestrianised banks of the Seine to the proliferation of bicycle lanes, who could deny that it has been swift and high impact?According to Luc Berman at Le réseau vélo et marche, a collective working to improve cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, the percentage of trips made on bicycle in Paris has gone from 2% to 12% in the last 10 years, while car use declined from 12% to 4%. “No other city in the world of this size has moved so quickly,” says Berman. “It’s an example of what political courage can achieve at the local level.”In the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdowns, the city threw up concrete barriers seemingly everywhere to carve out space for bicycles, and allowed restaurants to spread out terraces into streets. Those temporary measures have now been transformed into permanent cycling infrastructure and permanent demand for the expanded restaurant terraces.Will it all be enough, though? My bedroom – off my building’s inner courtyard – is fully protected from direct sunlight, but in last week’s searing temperatures, sleeping was still a challenge. Marine Le Pen’s far right is attempting to turn a demand for“obligatory” air-conditioninginto its cause célèbre, while of course opposing tackling the root cause of the heating, throughthe only forum significant enough to do so: the EU. When it comes to overheating retirement homes, schools, Métro trains and France’s nuclear-powered electricity grid, other parties would be foolish to let the National Rally claim this ground – these spaces do need air-conditioning. But in Paris’s 19th-century apartment stock, it’s clear that it will not be coming to save us en masse.This is our future. For the moment, extreme heat is still just a week here, a week there of sweaty, sleepless nights, but it will get worse. The Canadian zoologist and climate activist David Suzuki recently declared that “it’s too late” to solve the crisis. We can, and should, do as much as we can as fast as we can to limit every 10th of a degree of additional heating, but we have harmed our present and our future in an irreversible way and we’re already feeling it. All that cities can do is adapt. Some will do a better job of it than others. If that makes you gough, well – it’s the heat talking.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionParisEuropeSwitzerlandParks and green spacesFrancecommentShareReuse this content"

There are democracies where jury trial is rarer still. That is relevant context for the recommendation, published on Wednesday in an independentreview of the criminal courts, that more cases be heard by magistrates. There are also good reasons why the right to be judged by one’s peers is deemed a foundational principle of justice and an insuranceagainst prejudiceand capricious power. This, too, is relevant context.Sir Brian Leveson, a former judge, recognises the sensitivity around any restriction on jury trial. But he weighs it against “the real risk of total system collapse in the near future”. He argues that thebacklogof unheard crown court cases – currently about 77,000 – betrays the victims of crime, leaves witnesses and defendants in limbo and corrodes faith in the whole apparatus of justice. To get the system back on track, Sir Brian makes 45 recommendations, covering a range of sentencing and divisions of labour between police, magistrates and crown courts.The most controversial measure, if adopted by the government, is sure to be ending the right to be tried in front of a jury for offences that carry a maximum sentence of two years or fewer. The report also proposes that judges alone should decide complex fraud cases that notoriously tax jurors’ time and capacity to absorb highly technical testimony.Sir Brian is candid in acknowledging that the changes are not ideal. They express an invidious choice between unpalatable compromise and an intolerable status quo, tending towards calamity. He makes a case for reform irrespective of the wider fiscal constraints facing the government. But he notes also that the terms of reference for his inquiry sought recommendations that “take account of the likely operational and financial context at the time that they may be considered and implemented”.In other words, it is a question of finding the least worst solution when justice must be tailored to a tight budget. This is a crisis of long gestation. The justice department was among those “unprotected” portfolios that bore adisproportionate burdenof austerity when George Osborne was chancellor. The court system is also still struggling to recover from extreme disruption during the Covid pandemic. Labour has taken steps to ease the case backlog, funding more sitting days and appointing judges. But the rate of improvement is insufficient given the scale of the problem, hence the review and the drastic measures it proposes.Whether curtailment of jury trial is a price worth paying to avert the worst-case scenario is a nasty question that only arises because adequately funded reform is not on the table. This has become a painfully familiar political conundrum for Labour.The government was elected to fix a badly broken state, but on a manifesto that precluded most of theTreasury revenue-raisingmeasures that might expedite tangible change. As a result “reform” has become a euphemism for shrinking services and withdrawing entitlements. When the time comes, ministers might feel compelled by fiscal circumstance to accept Sir Brian’s recommendations. If so, they will struggle to make a  compelling case for a policy that so obviously compromises judicial principle for want of a long-term, better-funded plan.Explore more on these topicsLawOpinionBrian LevesoneditorialsShareReuse this content"

Empowering a new generation can help turn the tideWed 9 Jul 2025 13.25 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 18.23 EDTShareWish you were here? In recent years the fate of coastal towns has emerged as one of Britain’s most pressing social issues. Both the fishing and domestic tourism industries have been in decline for decades. Seaside communities routinely find themselves at the wrong end of national league tables when it comes to deprivation, job opportunities, educational attainment andmental and physical health.As the Guardian’s new reportingprojecton young people in coastal towns makes clear, the result for many 16- to 25-year-olds is acute frustration combined with the pressure of unwanted dilemmas. Most remain fiercelyloyalto places whose geographic isolation tends to generate a strong sense of belonging. But getting out to get on is, too often, perceived as the only option. The steady stream of departures in turn takes away skills and youthful dynamism, further diminishing the prospects of those left behind.Those growing up amid the natural beauty and social challenges of Britain’s coastal communities deserve better. But as one recentstudypoints out, the failure of past regeneration strategies suggests that a political rethink is necessary. Successful urban transformation projects, such as the re-imagining of Liverpool’s post-industrial waterfront, will not map on to smaller places unable to tap global investment possibilities. Similarly, the scale of theculture-led revivalof Margate – sparked by the opening of the Turner Contemporary gallery in 2011 – is out of reach for most towns, particularly those further away from London.Over the course of the next year, the Guardian will continue to canvass young people on what can be done to build better futures in Britain’s post-industrial port towns and hard-pressed seaside resorts. But one early conclusion can already be drawn: unleashing the energy, imagination and local pride of the young can be a vital catalyst for positive change.In Blackpool, for example, where 28% of the population were classed as economically inactive last year, a small-scale danceclubfounded in 2006 has evolved into a multi-purpose arts hub, offering direction and myriad activities to hundreds of teenagers. Its co-founder told the Guardian: “The optics are all wrong. You need to show young people that there are people in town doing creative, inspiring things.”Writ large, that approach would mean sustained, gamechanging investment in social capital as well as physical infrastructure. The benefits of the offshore wind revolution have yet to make a significant impact to the economic prospects of towns such as Great Yarmouth or Newhaven. Much more needs to be done to ensure that young people have access to the skills that will allow them to take advantage of the shift to renewable energy. In seaside resorts, where the interests of free-spending tourists are prioritised and work dries up out of season, the closure of local youth clubs and cuts to other leisure facilities havedeepeneda sense of neglect and abandonment.For too long, the struggles of communities with rich histories and a powerful sense of identity have languished near the bottom of Westminster priorities. “Growing up, I was always told to get out of Grimsby,” one young respondent told our reporters. With the right mix of long-term investment and empowerment in our coastal towns, it doesn’t need to be that way.Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionMental healthHealthPovertyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

The Lionesses will be guaranteed a place in the quarter‑finals if they defeat Wales in St Gallen on Sunday.England turn up the volume and drown out doubts against Netherlands | Nick AmesRead more“I think ‘proper English’ to us means: ‘We’ll work hard, we’ll work until we can’t run any more. We’ll stick together,’” Russo said, after being named as Uefa’s player of the match. “And we know we’re very dominant on the ball as well. Returning to that, that’s our standard, and that’s our DNA as a team, and we definitely saw that today, from the first minute right until the end. Everyone was working so hard.“We were really dominant on first and second balls, and clinical with our chances. We probably could have scored even more as well. It was definitely something that we wanted, to return to our roots, and we know we’re capable of performances like that.” When England hit such standards, she said, “the sky’s the limit”.Sarina Wiegman said the “proper England” phrase had been coined by her players since they responded to a disappointing draw with Portugal in February by beating the world champions Spain at Wembley in their next game. After her team again demonstrated their ability to bounce back strongly, the head coach said: “The players use that [phrase] a lot now. [It’s about] togetherness and the fight. But at the same time, when you’re in possession, for me it’s important that the passes we play are with purpose, and today you really saw the purpose in every pass we played, and for me that’s also ‘proper English’.”The England right-back Lucy Bronze praised her fellow defenders Jess Carter and Alex Greenwood for epitomising the idea, saying: “Alex [Greenwood] was front-footed, she was aggressive. Jess Carter was completely covering her every single minute of the game as well. You put in the hard work to make sure you’re doing a job for the team and that your teammate has got your back. Those two really embodied that and gave a lot of the rest of the team confidence.”The Netherlands head coach, Andries Jonker, admitted England’s performance took his side by surprise. “It is a heavy defeat and we didn’t see it coming, we thought we would be able to compete with England,” he said. “It was a surprise. I bear the responsibility. We were convinced this game plan would work out but unfortunately it didn’t.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But he was given a scare by the punchy young Italian Flavio Cobolli, as well as a nasty fall on match point, before coming through a pulsating quarter-final to win 6-7 (8), 6-2, 7-5, 6-4.Djokovic’s reward is a record 14thWimbledonsemi-final, one ahead of Roger Federer, and a meeting with the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, on Friday. It is a battle he is clearly relishing.Sinner eases past Shelton in straight sets to seal Wimbledon semi-final spotRead more“It motivates me to see how much I can still keep going with these guys toe to toe,” he said. “For me, this is what actually counts the most. Being in the last stages of grand slams and playing against the best player in the world right now. And Jannik and Carlos Alcaraz are the leaders of men’s tennis today.”Djokovic hit 39 winners and made just 22 errors against Cobolli, and reached shots that would have flown past lesser opponents. But he admits that Sinner, and potentially Alcaraz in the final, will prove a far tougher physical test.“I am pleased with the way I’m playing,” Djokovic said. “Physically I hope that I’ll be able to sustain that. That’s more of a concern than game‑wise. I think game-wise the way I’m feeling the ball when I’m fit and ready, I feel like I can go toe to toe with those guys and even beat them if I’m playing my best.”Beforehand the tale of the tape was so overwhelmingly in Djokovic’s favour that few gave Cobolli a shot. The Italian, after all, came into this match with a 1-11 record against the world’s top 10. His career record on grass stood at a modest nine wins and six defeats. And he was up against the greatest of all time, the seven-time champion here, and someone who had thrashed him 6-1, 6-2 in their only meeting.But this was a different Cobolli, one determined to roll the dice and with the confidence to believe he could provide the biggest shock of Wimbledon this year.In the last 16, Alex de Minaur had tried to defeat Djokovic by mixing deft spins and devilish unpredictability, and using the swirling wind as his friend. Cobolli’s approach was more blunt. He simply wanted to blast Djokovic off the court. It nearly worked, too.Djokovic said: “He played at a really high level. And at some parts of the match he was just serving so good that I wasn’t able to read or attack it.”View image in fullscreenFlavio Cobolli looks skywards during his quarter-final against Novak Djokovic.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianInitially the Italian looked to be feeling the pressure of his first grand slam quarter-final. His first shot – a return of serve – scooted into the net. And his second was a mis-hit.But Cobolli was determined to hit himself out of trouble. Serves were thundered down at more than 130mph, forehands were struck flat and hard, and he kept digging himself out of potential potholes.It said everything about the Italian’s game that even when down 5-3 in the first set, he broke back immediately and then took it on a tie‑break after a 137mph serve.Perhaps understandably, given this was his first time on Centre Court and he was playing his idol, Cobolli then had a wobble. From 2-1 up in the second set, he lost seven games in a row. In truth, it looked over.From nowhere, however, Cobolli’s radar suddenly started working again. At 2-0 down in the third set he broke back and led 5-4 before nerves got the better of him.Still the Italian kept fighting. But at 4-4 and 30-30 in the fourth set, the tension became too much. A double-handed backhand went halfway up the net before a drop volley was fluffed.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic fans cheer their man on during his quarter-final against Flavio Cobolli.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt left Djokovic serving for the match. But there was still time for more drama as, on the second match point, the Serb fell face first on to the grass after another Cobolli winner flashed past him and he appeared to hurt his hip.“It was a nasty fall,” Djokovic said. “It was very awkward. That happens on the grass. I’ve had quite a few of those throughout my grass court career.“Obviously, my body is not the same today like it was before, so I guess the real impact of what happened I will feel tomorrow. So let’s see. I’m hoping the next 24-48 hours that the severity is not too bad, that I’ll be able to play at my best and be free of pain in two days.”After the fall it took him a while to get up. Yet two points later, his hands were pointing skyward in triumph. Djokovic continues to confound expectations. Against Sinner he will have to do so again.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Novak DjokovicWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The team that went to Munich and putfive past Inter, the biggest winning margin in a European Cup final, came to New York and scored four against the game’s greatest aristocrats to take them to the final of the Club World Cup against Chelsea.PSG 4-0 Real Madrid: Club World Cup semi-final – as it happenedRead moreIf PSG had not scored more, it was because they did not need to. Three came inside half an hour here, two from Fabián Ruiz either side of another from Ousmane Dembélé; the fourth, scored by Gonçalo Ramos was an adornment added in the 87th minute, the ease with which it was scored eloquent. Madrid were not just defeated at the MetLife Stadium; they were destroyed, taken apart and never given the chance to compete.Under a new manager, their time may come, the absences of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen did not help, nor did the shift in formation with the return of Mbappé, and Xabi Alonso reflected on the errors that exposed them. But this went deeper; it is PSG’s time now.This is some machine, all right. Unstoppable, the sense of superiority just overwhelming from start to … well, not finish exactly, if only because the real finish came so early.By the time Ruiz gave them the lead after six minutes, it was the fourth clear chance they had, Madrid overrun already. First, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia hit the side-netting; then Thibaut Courtois made two incredible stops, suggesting this might be another of those days when the bullets could fly, everyone unloading on him, and he would still be standing there undefeated at the end of it. This time, though, it was not to be. Even he couldn’t stop everything.It did not help that he had been sold out by his centre-backs. So badly, in fact, that the best thing that happened in the sequence that led to the first goal was that PSG scored it. Raúl Asencio allowed a simple control to escape . Suddenly a blue shirt was upon him – now there’s a line that would be repeated, defining much of this – and Dembélé took the ball from him, right in front of goal. Courtois took Dembélé down, committing what would have been a penalty and possibly a red card had Ruiz not been on hand to sidefoot into the empty net.View image in fullscreenGonçalo Ramos (second right) scores PSG’s fourth goal in the 87th minute.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was Antonio Rüdiger’s turn next, swiping at and missing the ball. Again, Dembélé was on to him in a flash. Racing through, he guided past Courtois. Nine minutes in and this was done. Not just because of the goals, although a third followed, but the play, the intensity in PSG and the lack of it from Madrid. The recent evolution under Alonso was nowhere to be seen, optimism evaporating.Yet if Madrid had fallen off a cliff, their opponents had forced them to the edge and helped push them over it too, relentless. Vitinha, Ruiz and João Neves closed every gap as fast as the front three opened them. And the full-backs, Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes … well, calling them full-backs feels utterly inadequate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Setting off near his area, running 70 yards and playing three passes, he reached the other end and set up Ruiz to roll Federico Valverde and score. Half an hour in, PSG had 78% of the ball, 10 shots and were 3-0 up, as good as through.There was a Kvaratskhelia moment so good it made you laugh, taking it off Mbappé, nutmegging Arda Güler and heading off up the wing. Jude Bellingham had to make a superb recovery tackle but Madrid had been opened again, just as they had a moment earlier when they were grateful for a heavy Désiré Doué touch as he dashed free.And indeed when the referee, Szymon Marciniak, called back another PSG break because Mbappé was down. Courtois made two more saves before the break. At which point, it was all Madrid could aspire to for this to end here.Which it kind of did. Kvaratskhelia and Dembélé were gone by the hour, Ruiz and Doué six minutes later. Between those, Bellingham and Vinícius Júnior made way too. Gigi Donnarumma did not have a save to make, the contest closed. But there at the end were Bradley Barcola and Ramos playing it between them in the Madrid area, the striker turning and adding another for the fun of it, a final little flourish from the machine.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Paris Saint-GermainReal MadridClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

So the conversation that confirmed his return to Test cricket was entirely typical, said England’s captain, Ben Stokes: “I went: ‘Are you ready this week?’ And he went: ‘Been ready.’ That was literally it.”Archer back to face India at Lord’s as Wood eyes surprise return in time for fifth TestRead more“Jof is very unassuming. He doesn’t give a lot away. But he’s very, very passionate about playing cricket. He’s a very, very determined human being. And if he wasn’t that way inclined, he probably wouldn’t be in the situation where he’s playing tomorrow.”Since he walked out here for a thrilling debut performance in 2019, and despite being at least in theory a first-choice player since, Archerhas bowled 434.5 overs in Test cricket. That is considerably fewer than Shoaib Bashir, who would have followed the 2019 Ashes as a 15-year-old schoolboy and made his debut just last year, and only marginally more than Dom Bess, not picked since 2021. Archer has bowled only 18 red-ball overs in the past four years. So fans will gather in St John’s Wood in excited anticipation of seeing something genuinely rare and potentially thrilling.“I don’t think there’s any reason we can’t see him operating at the level we saw here at Lord’s on his debut,” Stokes said. “I think the expectations of Jofra are completely understandable. It’s such a positive for him as a player, because of what everyone knows he can do. And that proves how skilful a bowler he is, the impact that he can have on the teams he plays for. So I don’t see that being a negative thing, the expectations around Jofra this week. Absolutely not.”As is typical for a seamer on the day before a Test, Archer barely bowled on Wednesday, a few deliveries off a shortened run-up and well short of top speed (Jasprit Bumrah, who returns for India, did not train at all). But the hope is that the 30-year-old’s pace – in that 2019 game, he hit a top speed of 96.1mph – will bring genuine menace to a bowling lineup that has often not so much frightened India’s top order as fed them.So far in this series, the tourists’ top four have scored 1,128 runs at an average of 70.50, England’s 571 runs came at an average of 38.06 (improved by a not out) – a difference that at Edgbaston stretched to 82.37 for India, compared with England’s 12. The series is finely poised at 1-1, but that scoreline disguises a disparity of achievements across the opening two games.Quick GuideEngland team v IndiaShowBen Duckett, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (capt), Jamie Smith, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Shoaib Bashir.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Apositive result in the first Testapplied a glossy veneer to an unexceptional England display, their victory assisted by some poor India fielding, the complete collapse of the touring side’s lower order (twice) and their own relish for chasing. This being sport, the winning side happily kept the same team for the second match, while the losing side made wholesale changes. The outcome was an even more dominant India performance, and five days in Birmingham that saw England not just beaten, but humbled.And now the questions are manifold. Are the instructions England give to Test groundstaff – “Pretty simple: a bit of pace, a bit of carry,” according to Stokes last week – producing surfaces that maximise their chances of success? Why was the unheralded Akash Deep, in particular,able to find demonsin an Edgbaston surface that England’s seamers had made to look so sleepy?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And has the improvement in Stokes’s bowling since his hamstring operation in January, which at times this summer has looked as good as it has in years, been inspired by some diabolical trade-off with the gods of batting?Having won the toss and chosen to bowl first in each of the first two matches, decisions widely criticised but only one actually backfiring, Stokes said that England “are not stuck in our ways around anything whatsoever”.“You’ve obviously got to decide on something,” he said. “You’ve only really got looking up [at the weather] to maybe sway you one way or the other, and then what happens after that is completely out of your control. It’s one of those where you’ve just got to commit to it and what will be will be.”The same is true of the decision to rush Archer back, a selection that reflects feelings of optimism and genuine excitement, and a nostalgic reverence for his performances of the regrettably distant past, but also simple relief at being able to give formidable opponents a fresh and fast test. And, perhaps, just a little desperation.Explore more on these topicsEngland v India 2025Jofra ArcherBen StokesEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But that would be very wrong.An admittedly emphatic scoreline that leaves France top of Group D and imperiously on course for the quarter-finals does not tell the whole story of a much improved Wales performance on a night when Jess Fishlock scored a historic goal.France 4-1 Wales: Women’s Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreGranted, only highly improbable mathematics dictate that their impending tournament exit is not quite rubber-stamped but Rhian Wilkinson’s players made Laurent Bonadei’s gifted side work hard for a convincing win.Wales arrived at the St Gallen Arena in a new team bus with a fresh driver at the wheel. Wilkinson’s squad were badly shaken when their original coach was involved in a collision with a car en route to a training session on Tuesday afternoon but her switch to a back four amid a quartet of personnel changes was all about tactical choice.In contrast Bonadei’s decision to rotate so heavily that the France starting XI contained only four survivors from the2-1 win against Englandlast Saturday reflected a desire to keep his stars well rested.Having analysed theNetherlands’ opening 3-0 victoryagainst Wales the France coach clearly felt sufficiently confident to rest seven key players including two outstanding forwards in Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Sandy Baltimore.If that bolstered the morale of the travelling Red Wall, aka near 2,000 travelling Wales supporters, so, too, did the replacement of the rain that soaked St Gallen in recent days with tepid evening sunshine.View image in fullscreenSafia Middleton-Patel cannot get near Amel Majri’s third goal for France.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersYet as dusk descended, a slight chill permeated the air. Wales looked in peril of freezing as France began in menacing mode with Manchester United’s Safia Middleton-Patel, who had replaced Olivia Clark in goal, quickly forced to save from the impressive Clara Matéo with her legs.When the otherwise indomitable Angharad James-Turner failed to clear a corner, the ball fell for Matéo to chest down and volley expertly beyond Middleton-Patel.Undeterred, Fishlock – who else? – responded by conjuring the moment for which Wales waited so long; their first goal at their inaugural major tournament.Despite being tackled, Ceri Holland somehow managed to dink the ball into Fishlock’s path and Wales’s 38-year-old record goalscorer needed no invitation to direct it into the back of the net.Although an offside flag paused ecstatic celebrations they resumed once VAR came to the rescue and it was decided Fishlock’s goal stood after all. The Seattle Reign midfielder, who made her Wales debut almost two decades ago, became the oldest player to score at a women’s European Championship and immediately raced towards a suddenly tearful Wilkinson.“What a moment,” Fishlock said later. “I’m extremely proud of the girls tonight; for most of it we were in the game but we need to be better in little moments.”Her goal relaxed Wales to the point where they remembered they can actually play a bit. So much so that Bonadei’s youthful backline lost their way for a while.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIndeed France seemed so unnerved by their opponents’ counterattacking capacity that Wilkinson’s players found themselves on the receiving end of a series of rather desperate, and hefty, challenges.View image in fullscreenJess Fishlock (centre) runs towards the dugout after scoring Wales’ first goal at a major tournament.Photograph: Gian Ehrenzeller/EPAThen Wales went and ruined it all by conceding a needless penalty when Holland lunged in on Matéo. Kadidiatou Diani converted from the spot, somewhat fortuitously after her fancy run-up produced the tamest of kicks straight down the middle. Yet although Middleton-Patel, diving to her right, got a foot to it she could only divert the ball into her own net, leaving it to trickle over the line.That setback apart, Wilkinson’s smart decision to play a formation that swiftly morphed into a brave version of 4-4-2 discomfited France for long periods.Significantly only an awful error from Middleton-Patel, who dithered over a clearance, enabled Matéo to steal possession before passing sublimely for Amel Majri to lash home. In mitigation, the goalkeeper is only 20 and generally her footwork is very good.Now, though, her inexperience showed and, when she misread Diani’s cross, Grace Geyoro applied the finishing close-range touch.As French fans dared to dream of a first major tournament triumph, Fishlock thanked the Red Wall. “They were loud and proud,” she said. “We have the best fans in the world.”“I’m very proud of that performance against very strong opposition,” said Wilkinson. “I truly believe France are one of the top three teams in the world. Yes, we lost 4-1 but we showed up and were courageous against one of the world’s best teams. It’s not always about the result. It’s fine margins but we’ve shown everyone how proud we are to represent Wales.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025France women's football teamWales women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Getting the noise out of your head and getting a different noise in.”The bones of England’s defeat by France had been well and truly picked over, and there was a calmness around the England camp in the buildup to a game Toone described as “a final that’s come really early in the tournament”. In the morning Toone, Leah Williamson, Keira Walsh, Alessia Russo and Beth Mead played Monopoly; Bronze did a puzzle with Michelle Agyemang and Maya Le Tissier.England know how to win knockout matches, having reached back-to-back major tournament finals, and that was the territory they had entered a little earlier than planned. They also know how to shake off a defeat against top level teams, their 2-1 Nations League loss to France in May 2024 followed by a 2-1 win over the same opposition in Saint-Étienne four days later. They also knew they had lost opening games and gone far at the World Cup in 2015 and the Euros in 2009. Messages came in from former Lionesses to remind them of those things, the Euro 2022 group chat still active.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Stanway puts England 2-0 ahead.Photograph: Ralf Ibing/firo sportphoto/Getty Images“Jill Scott’s obviously hanging around, she’s a very positive influence,” said Bronze. “Toni Duggan was actually someone who texted me straight away after the game, sharing experiences. There’s plenty of them. They always put in messages to say good luck, to keep going. Millie Bright, Fran Kirby, loads of them are messaging.”The Netherlands were a familiar foe, Sarina Wiegman’s former side having eight WSL players in the XI and two more who have played in England. From Wiegman’s selection it was clear she could see the issues many had theorised over since the France game.Toone returned to the midfield, restoring some structure to it, generational talent James was not sacrificed but shifted wide, replacing Mead, and the left-footed Alex Greenwood returned to her old left-back berth with Jess Carter partnering Williamson in the middle of defence. James in the No 10 role had been a valid experiment, but it hadn’t paid off.However, as Stanway had pointed out, a terrible England ran France close and an equaliser had not been out of the question as the clock ticked down in Zurich. They just needed to be better.View image in fullscreenLauren James fires home England’s third.Photograph: Matthew Childs/ReutersThe difference between the sloppy and slightly shellshocked play against France and the focused and aggressive football played against the Netherlands in a sunny Stadion Letzigrund was night and day. The threat of an exit had sharpened the minds and the passing significantly, and Walsh, Stanway and Toone dictated play from the middle and increased the potency of Lauren Hemp and James out wide as Andries Jonker’s side got narrower and narrower. “Today we were a lot better individually and that adds to the collective,” said Bronze.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIf this ground had been France’s playground on Saturday, it was England’s turn to play on Wednesday evening and by the 23rd minute they had a deserved lead. It was back-to-front route one football. Hannah Hampton’s pitch-splitting pass found Russo to the right, the forward played it to James and she cut inside and lashed past Daphne van Domselaar.England had been worthy of a second and it came in added time at the end of the first half when a free-kick not far inside the Netherlands half was half-cleared as far as Russo and the Arsenal player flicked the ball on to Stanway, who fired in.Russo was denied a goal shortly after the break, her header ruled out because Williamson had been offside in the buildup, but it mattered little. England were so rampant that Jonker had rung the changes at half-time, Caitlin Dijkstra, Sherida Spitse and Lineth Beerensteyn brought on for centre-back Veerle Buurman, midfielder Jill Roord and right-back Esmee Brugts.The holders’ third arrived on the hour. Russo swiped and missed, Toone’s effort came back off a defender and James stroked in the loose ball. Toone made up for that miss shortly after, Russo cutting back for her to skip free of a challenge and poke home.It was game over, the final minutes played out with little of note. The final whistle prompted a deafening rendition of Sweet Caroline from the stands, the vibe so different from the first game. England’s title defence is well and truly alive, but they will be cautious.“On paper we know that Wales and England, to the rest of the world, might not look like an even, balanced game, but it’s a rivalry,” said Bronze. “I’m sure Wales will be wanting to spoil the English party, so I think we can’t look too far ahead.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamNetherlands women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I was not expecting to be so far ahead of him in this time trial. I expected him to be closer to Remco, but maybe he didn’t have a great day.”While the Olympic and world time trial champion Evenepoel, riding at an average speed of 54km/h, claimed an expected stage success, Pogacar was the real winner, as Vingegaard’s challenge wilted in the heat of the Calvados afternoon.With Vingegaard now under pressure to combat his rival, there may be further tension in the camp, with his American teammate Matteo Jorgenson, winner of the Paris-Nice race in March, just nine seconds behind him.“I don’t have an explanation,” Visma’s head of racing, Grischa Niermann, said of his team leader’s result. “Of course, we hoped for more. I guess Jonas didn’t have enough power today.”Pogacar, however, was not getting carried away. “I always have eyes on everybody, not just one guy,” he said. “You cannot discount all the riders up to top 10 in general classification.View image in fullscreenRemco Evenepoel powers his way towards a time trial victory.Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images“Jonas is the most hungry to get back time, he’s in super good shape, his team’s in good form, so they will try, maybe tomorrow or the next day.”Yet there is no doubt the pendulum has now swung in Pogacar’s favour. Evenepoel, winner of the 2024 Tour time trial stage to Gevrey‑Chambertin, had predicted he would make up almost a minute on Pogacar and, quickly into his compact position, set off at breakneck pace. Despite winning the stage, the Belgian did not achieve the time gains for which he had hoped.The Slovenian, blindsided by a flying Evenepoel in the Critérium du Dauphiné time trial a month ago, was this time a different prospect. His performance around Caen was much more competitive than expected and kept the Belgian in check, while transforming a slim overnight advantage over Vingegaard of 8sec into a significant 1min 13sec.But on a stage thankfully free of any of the pile-ups that have marked some of the earlier stages, the safety debate still shadowed the peloton, after the Canadian rider Mike Woods, 122nd overall in the Tour, said that race organisers ASO “love crashes”.Writing on his blog, the 38 year old Woods, a stage winner in the 2023 Tour, said: “Despite their claimed attempts to make the sport safer, one gets a sense – when watching any highlight reel they create – that blood, broken bikes, and some poor bastard walking into an ambulance are what they love to sell.”View image in fullscreenAll eyes on Tadej Pogacar on stage five.Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesAnother casualty of earlier crashes, Emilien Jeannniere of France, who was catapulted into the crowd barriers in the stage to Dunkirk on Monday, quit the race after it was discovered that he had broken his shoulder, even though he successfully finished stage four into Rouen.“It’s sad to abandon my first Tour, but there are other races and I have to put my health first,” the 26 year old rider said.Others are faring better, with the rising British talents Oscar Onley and the Tour debutant Joe Blackmore quickly finding their feet in this year’s race. In contrast, prospects looked gloomier for Ineos Grenadiers with Carlos Rodriguez now languishing in 16th place, four minutes behind Pogacar, after the first time trial.The sixth stage on Thursday, from Bayeux to Vire, includes six categorised climbs and may see more sparring at the uphill finish, on the 14% slopes of the Avenue d’Atlacomulco.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

Having already lost Elliot Daly there are now doubts over Blair Kinghorn’s availability for the Test series after the Scotland player limped off in the first half of theLions’ 36-24 victory against the Brumbies.Kinghorn, widely expected to start at 15 against the Wallabies, lasted just 25 minutes before leaving the field and the Lions are now awaiting an update on the severity of the injury. “He got a bang on the knee,” the Lions head coach, Andy Farrell, said. “He carried on for quite a bit but there was no need to keep him going.”Van der Flier caps win as Lions labour to patchy victory over ACT BrumbiesRead moreFarrell insisted he was not fearing the worst “at this moment in time” and said Kinghorn “was in good spirits” in the dressing room.The Lions are now heading to Adelaide for the game against the Invitational Australia & New Zealand XV on Saturday and, as a matter of urgency, will want some clarity regarding the 28-year-old Kinghorn’s fitness. “It is late, we have got an early flight in the morning and I don’t what the medical plan is, but we will get on top of that,” Farrell said.Should the tall Scot be ruled out his likely Test replacement is Hugo Keenan, who has played just one game on the tour to date because of illness.The way Kinghorn banged his fist on the turf in frustration when the injury occurred did not bode particularly well. It also potentially leaves Farrell short of specialist cover in a pivotal position. Had the unfortunate Daly been replaced last week by a back-three playerrather than Owen Farrell, the Lions would already have an extra full-back in Australia. Instead, in the event of Kinghorn being ruled out, Wales’s Blair Murray, Ireland’s Jamie Osborne or England’s Freddie Steward will be among the fresh names in the frame.View image in fullscreenMaro Itoje, the Lions captain, passes during the touring side’s win against the ACT Brumbies.Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty ImagesFarrell, meanwhile, believes there is good reason for Lions fans to keep the faith, despite another uneven performance characterised by issues around the breakdown and frequent turnovers. He also claimed his Lions side was tactically holding back “quite a bit” and it is certainly true that the policy of not competing too hard at the rucks in the warm-up games will need to change for the bigger matches.Either way, Ollie Chessum and Garry Ringrose both enhanced their prospects of making the Test starting XV and Farrell will be happy with the form of his fly-half Finn Russell and the captain, Maro Itoje.“We are in a good place in the sense that we are doing well in certain aspects of the game,” Farrell said. “But we need to improve inallareas.

People like to decide in their own mind my own thoughts in regards to what selection looks like, but it was the truth. We are testing ourselves by trying to throw a few things in, so we know where we want to go to.”Itoje, for his part, believes there is still time to sort out the Lions’ breakdown and restart travails. “We know we’re not the finished article, we know that we have to get better, we know that we have to improve. But I think that’s a pretty good position for us to be in.“We just need to be a little bit more accurate. The ruck’s a hotly contested area and I’m sure they’ll feel a little bit aggrieved in the Brumbies camp about some of the decisions as well. It’s rugby.“The breakdown is part of one of the big contest areas of our game and it’s an area where I think they’re going for it because of the way we attack. The pressure at the breakdown [in Australia] is no surprise to us but, first things first, we need to look after our own ruck.”Explore more on these topicsLions tour 2025British & Irish LionsAustralia rugby union teamRugby unionAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

But Lyon, who are owned by John Textor’s Eagle Football Holdings, have earned a reprieve after an appeal hearing in Paris on Wednesday and are expected to take up their place in next season’sEuropa Leagueafter finishing sixth last season.The French football federation said in a statement that the decision by the DNCG’s appeal commission “invalidates the administrative relegation” and allowed for Lyon’s wage bill and transfer spend to be monitored.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That is likely to have a major ramifications on Uefa’s decision on whether Palace, who qualified for the Europa League bywinning the FA Cup, will be cleared to participate in Europe after a ruling was delayed last week pending the outcome of Lyon’s appeal.Clubs are barred from competing in the same Uefa competition if an individual or ownership group is considered to have a decisive influence over more than one of those teams. Textor remains Palace’s largest shareholder but the US businessman recentlyagreed a deal to sell his Palace sharesto the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson. The former US ambassador to the UK must pass the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test before he can complete the purchase but it is understood that is nearing completion.Uefa sources have indicated that its Club Financial Control Body , which investigates alleged breaches of its multi-club ownership rules, is due to decide on Palace’s fate this week. With Lyon, who were fined €12.5m (£10.8m) byUefafor a breach of financial sustainability requirements last week, having been cleared by Uefa to play in European competition if they were reinstated to France’s top flight, Palace’s prospects of joining Aston Villa as the Premier League’s representatives in the competition won by Tottenham last season appear slim.There is a chance that they could be demoted to the Conference League, with Nottingham Forest taking Palace’s place in the Europa League.Palace, who have never played in a major European competition, are expected to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport if they are barred from the Europa League. Last monthUefa rejected attemptsfrom Textor and his Palace co-owner David Blitzer, the majority shareholder at Danish side Brøndby, to put their shares in a blind trust after they missed the 1 March deadline.Textor announced last week that he had resigned from his leadership roles at Lyon, with Michael Gerlinger appointed as the chief executive and Michele Kang – who owns Washington Spirit and London City Lionesses and bought Lyon’s extremely successful women’s team from Eagle Football Holdings last year – as the chair and president. She is understood to have led Lyon’s appeal, with reports in France saying the club have agreed on an “austerity plan” designed to stabilise its finances after being asked to inject up to €200m to keep the club inLigue 1.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool finished seventh of 12 in the WSL table.Taylor was aWomen’s FA Cup winnerwith Manchester City in 2020 and also led them tothe League Cup in 2022, before a second-placed finish in the league in 2024. The 52-year-old had previously coached within Manchester City’s academy.The former Wales striker spent just under five years at the helm at Manchester City, before beingsacked in March, just days before this year’s League Cup final. During his playing career, he represented a range of clubs including Sheffield United, Nottingham Forest and Manchester City.Liverpool are two-time former WSL winners, having lifted the title twice in succession during Beard’s first spell in charge of the club in 2013 and 2014, but they have not challenged for the title for a decade. They were relegated down to the second tier in 2020 but won promotion back to the top flight under Beard in 2022 and secured an impressive fourth-placed finish in 2024, and they were FA Cup quarter-finalists in that same year.The Merseyside club were not the only WSL side searching for a new head coach this summer. Tottenham haveappointed the Englishman Martin Ho, while Manchester City opted to hire the Swedish-born coach of the Denmark women’s national side,Andree Jeglertz, who will take over at Manchester City after Euro 2025. In WSL 2, Southampton have appointed the former Blackburn coach Simon Parker, Crystal Palace have hired the former Rangers manager Jo Potter and Bristol City have appointed the former Manchester United assistant coach, Charlotte Healy.Manchester Cityhave signed the Germany international Sydney Lohmann, subject to international clearance and a work visa. The 25-year-old arrives from Bayern Munich and has signed a three-year deal. She had been with Bayern since 2016 and won four Bundesliga titles during her time at the club.“I have a really positive feeling here at Manchester City,” she told the club website. “I’ve always had the thought to playing abroad at some point in my career and I just had the feeling that this year was the right time to do that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Journalistic investigations have revealed that first responders asked that a mass-alert system in Kerr county be triggered on Friday morning. The alert system sends text messages and “delivers pre-recorded emergency telephone messages” to some people in the area.Dispatchers delayed a 4.22am request from volunteer firefighters for an alert to be sent, saying they needed special authorization, according toreporting from Texas Public Radio (TPR)based on emergency radio transmissions they reviewed. Some residents received flood warnings within an hour. Others told TPR they did not receive an alert until 10am – nearly six hours after first responders’ request. Aseparate storyfrom KSAT confirms TPR’s reporting.There are inconsistencies regarding local officials’ response. In his first press conference on 4 July after the flood, the Kerr county judge said the area did not have an emergency alert system.“I believe those questions need to be answered, to the families of the missed loved ones, to the public, you know, to the people who put me in this office.

Both Israel and the US, which provides military support, have strongly denied that accusation.In recent weeks, Albanese has issued a series of letters, urging other countries to pressure Israel, including through sanctions, to end its deadly bombardment of the Gaza Strip. The Italian national has also been a strong supporter of the international criminal court’s indictment of Israeli officials, including the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, for war crimes. She most recently issued a report naming several US giants among companies aiding what she described as Israel’s occupation and war on Gaza.US vetoes resolution for unconditional Gaza ceasefire at UN security councilRead more“Albanese’s campaign of political and economic warfare against the United States and Israel will no longer be tolerated,” the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, posted on social media. “We will always stand by our partners in their right to self-defense.”Albanese has been the target of criticism from pro-Israel officials and groups in the US and in the Middle East. Last week, the US mission to the UN issued a scathing statement, calling for her removal for “a years-long pattern of virulent anti-Semitism and unrelenting anti-Israel bias”.The statement said that Albanese’s allegations of Israel committing genocide or apartheid are “false and offensive”.It is all a culmination of an extraordinary and sprawling campaign of nearly six months by theTrump administrationto quell criticism of Israel’s handling of the deadly war in Gaza, which is closing in on two years. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began arresting and deporting faculty and students of American universities who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and other political activities.The war between Israel and Hamas began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and killed nearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people captive. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which says women and children make up most of the dead but does not specify how many were fighters or civilians.Nearly 21 months into the conflict that displaced the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, it is nearly impossible for the critically wounded to get the care they need, doctors and aid workers say.“We must stop this genocide, whose short-term goal is completing the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, while also profiteering from the killing machine devised to perform it,” Albanese said in a recent post on X. “No one is safe until everyone is safe.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMarco RubioTrump administrationUnited NationsPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Where were you educated?”Boakai seemed to chuckle. English is the official language of Liberia.“In Liberia?” Trump asked. “Yes sir,” Boakai said.“That’s very interesting, that’s beautiful English” Trump said. “I have people at this table who can’t speak nearly as well.”‘Delay is catastrophic’: how simple solutions could save thousands of African children in comasRead moreLiberia was founded in 1822 as a colony for free Black Americans, the brainchild of white Americans trying to address what they saw as a problem – the future for Black people in the US once slavery ended. English is Liberia’s official language, though multiple Indigenous languages are spoken there as well.Trump hosted the leaders from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal at the White House on Wednesday, telling them that he was shifting the US approach to the continent from aid to trade and that the US is a better partner forAfricathan China. Many of the leaders at the meeting spoke in their own languages through interpreters.Trump said his administration was committed to strengthening friendships in Africa, which he hoped to visit at some point.“We’re shifting from aid to trade,” he said at the start of a White House meeting. “There’s great economic potential in Africa, like few other places. In many ways, in the long run, this will be far more effective and sustainable and beneficial than anything else that we can be doing together.”The African leaders, in turn, heaped praise on the US president for brokering peace deals around the world and expressed support for his receiving a Nobel Prize.“We are not poor countries. We are rich countries when it comes to raw materials. But we need partners to support us and help us develop those resources,” said Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, president of Gabon. “You are welcome to come and invest.

In an apparent research breakthrough, eight operations were conducted on pig organs with a 100% success rate by a team led by experts at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in the US.The Royal College of Surgeons in the UK called it “an exciting development that shows great promise”, while John McGrath, a leading expert on robotic surgery in the UK, called the results “impressive” and “novel” and said it “takes us further into the world of autonomy”.It opens up the possibility of replicating, en masse, the skills of the best surgeons in the world.The technology allowing robots to handle complex soft tissues such as gallbladders, which release bile to aid digestion, is rooted in the same type of computerised neural networks that underpin widely used artificial intelligence tools such as Chat GPT or Google Gemini.The surgical robots were slightly slower than human doctors but they were less jerky and plotted shorter trajectories between tasks. The robots were also able to repeatedly correct mistakes as they went along, asked for different tools and adapted to anatomical variation, according to apeer-reviewed paperpublished in the journal Science Robotics.The authors from Johns Hopkins, Stanford and Columbia universities called it “a milestone toward clinical deployment of autonomous surgical systems”.Almost all the 70,000 robotic procedures carried out annually in the NHS in England were fully controlled under human instruction, with only bone-cutting for hip and knee operations semi-autonomous, McGrath said. Last month the health secretary, Wes Streeting, said increasing robotic surgery was at the heart of a 10-year plan to reform the NHS and cut waiting lists. Within a decade, the NHS has said, nine in 10 of all keyhole surgeries will be carried out with robot assistance, up from one in five today.In the Johns Hopkins trial, the robots took just over five minutes to carry out the operation, which required 17 steps including cutting the gallbladder away from its connection to the liver, applying six clips in a specific order and removing the organ. The robots on average corrected course without any human help six times in each operation.“We were able to perform a surgical procedure with a really high level of autonomy,” said Axel Krieger, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Johns Hopkins. “In prior work, we were able to do some surgical tasks like suturing. What we’ve done here is really a full procedure. We have done this on eight gallbladders, where the robot was able to perform precisely the clipping and cutting step of gallbladder removal without any human intervention.“So I think it’s a really big landmark study that such a difficult soft tissue surgery is possible to do autonomously.”McGrath, who chairs NHS England’s robotics steering committee, said autonomous surgery, while still years away, could one day lead to a human surgeon overseeing several autonomous robotic operations at the same time, carrying out simple procedures such as hernia operations or gall bladder removals more rapidly, with greater precision than humans and with less damage to surrounding bodily structures.But he cautioned that autonomous surgery remained a long way from being clinically deployable, because tests on dead pig organs do not test the robots’ capacity to react to a patient moving and breathing, blood running in the field of operation, an inadvertent injury, smoke from cauterisation or fluid on the camera lens.Nuha Yassin, who leads on robotic surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: “The next step must involve a careful exploration of the nuances within this rapidly evolving field to assess how these findings can be safely and effectively translated into a human pilot. Only then can this approach move toward, becoming a sustainable model for the future.”She said training, education and patient safety must remain at the forefront.Explore more on these topicsMedical researchArtificial intelligence (AI)US universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

He committed to prioritising support for the Caribbean nation, which is a member of Caricom.The global south needs more than tinkering at a conference: debt forgiveness is the only fair way | Kenneth MohammedRead moreSpeaking to the Guardian at the conference, the prime minister ofAntigua and Barbuda, Gaston Browne, said the challenge of crime and security “is one of the most significant existential threats facing the region”.“It requires a collaborative approach among Caricom countries and we recognise that the criminals are getting far more sophisticated and when you look at the issue of transnational criminal activities it is important for us to conjoin our efforts,” he said.Echoing his sentiments, Terrance Drew, theSt Kitts and Nevisprime minister, said he welcomed a regional approach to the issue. “The region is dealing with the issue of security on multiple levels, Haiti being the area that is most affected. I think this would require, of course, the coordination of all of the member states of the Caricom … so I welcome the reiteration of us working together as a region,” he said.Even as the conference was opening in Montego Bay, Jamaica, on Sunday,Haiti’s once-iconic Hotel Oloffson, a beloved Gothic gingerbread building in Port-au-Prince that inspired books, hosted parties and attracted visitors from Mick Jagger to Haitian presidents, was burned down by gangs.According to the UN, since January, more than 4,000 people have been killed in Haiti, a 24% increase compared with the same period last year.Speaking at a press conference at the meeting, Laurent Saint-Cyr, a member of Haiti’s Transitional Presidential Council, joined the calls for stronger regional assistance to curb the illicit arms trade and drug trafficking, which play a part in fuelling Haiti’s crisis.“Haiti, today, needs the region to speak with one voice in defense of security, peace and sustainable development,” he said, adding, “we are also counting on you to intensify advocacy with other regional and global partners for increased support towards more rigorous regional cooperation.”Holness, who has proposed a regional justice and security framework, called for a strong and coordinated response to the escalating violence in the region, which he said had evolved far beyond traditional street-level crime, posing a threat to the region’s security.“We must dismantle the influence of gangs in our communities, disrupt their finances … I am on record as saying that we need to launch a war on gangs of a similar magnitude and nature to the ‘war on terror’,” he said.In the past, Caribbean leaders have jointlyraised concernsabout the alarming “epidemic of crime and violence in the Caribbean, fueled by illegal guns and organised criminal gangs”. In 2024, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaicatopped Statista’s homicide ratesranking for Latin America and the Caribbean.Affirming her commitment to unity on regional justice and security, the outgoing chair of Caricom, Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, in her speech at the conference pointed to the issue of gun trafficking from the US to the Caribbean: “Regrettably I’ve said over and over we pay a high price for the second amendment rights of the United States of America’s citizens,” she said.In 2024, the New York attorney general,Letitia James, announced new measures and legislation to tackle gun trafficking from the US to the Caribbean. James quoted Jamaican government estimates that at least 200 guns are trafficked into the country from the US every month, and said that the weapons were fuelling violent crime and enabling networks that traffic drugs to the US.But Jamaica has since seen a significant decline in murders. The country has accomplished a more than 40% reduction in murders in the first five months of the year, compared with the same period last year, the result, officials say, of a “sustained and strategic” multibillion-dollarinvestment in national security.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

They attributed 1,500 of the deaths to climate breakdown, which has heated the planet and made the worst extremes even hotter.Milan was the hardest-hit city in absolute terms, with 317 out of 499 heat deaths attributed to climate breakdown, followed by Paris and Barcelona. London had 273 heat deaths, 171 of which the researchers attributed to human influence on the climate.“This study demonstrates why heatwaves are known as silent killers,” said Malcolm Mistry, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and co-author of the study. “While a handful of deaths have been reported in Spain, France and Italy, thousands more people are expected to have died as a result of the blistering temperatures.”Graphic showing heat deaths across Europe last monthThe rapid analysis from the World Weather Attribution group, which used established methods but has not yet been submitted for peer review, blames climate breakdown for two-thirds of the deaths.Older people had the highest mortality, the study found, with 88% of the climate-driven deaths in people over the age of 65. The researchers said extreme heat was an “underappreciated” threat as most victims died out of public view in homes and hospitals, and with little media coverage.“Heatwaves don’t leave a trail of destruction like wildfires or storms,” said Ben Clarke, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and co-author of the study. “Their impacts are mostly invisible but quietly devastating. A change of just 2 or 3C can mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people.”The scientists used epidemiological models to estimate heat-related mortality in cities such as Paris, London, Madrid and Rome over a 10-day-period, and compared the death toll with that of a hypothetical world in which humans had not heated the planet by burning fossil fuels or destroying nature.They cautioned that the relationships between temperature and death they used in their models were derived from local mortality data up to 2019, and so may not fully capture how people in each city have adapted to hotter weather over time.They found climate breakdown pushed temperatures in some cities up to 4C higher, resulting in 1,500 extra deaths. The death toll was greater than that of other recent weather disasters that were made worse by fossil fuel pollution, such as the floods that killed 224 people in Spain in 2024 and the floods that killed 243 people across north-west Europe in 2021.Previous studies have estimated that about 44,000 people die from heat in Europe each year, averaged over the past few decades. The scientists suggested the vast death toll of 2,300 people from a single heatwave in just 12 cities could make this summer particularly dangerous.The EU’s Earth observation service, Copernicus, said last month was the third hottest June on record globally and that an “exceptional” marine heatwave developed in the western Mediterranean. The average daily sea surface temperature was the highest ever recorded for the region in June at 27C.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Parts of Spain had as many as 24 tropical nights last month, 18 more than the average for June.Samantha Burgess, a deputy director of the Copernicus climate change service, said the record temperatures in the Mediterranean made the heat stress that large parts of Europe experienced “much more intense”.She said: “In a warming world, heatwaves are likely to become more frequent, more intense and impact more people across Europe.”Analysis by Mercator Ocean, a nonprofit research organisation that runs Copernicus’s marine service, found nearly two-thirds of the Mediterranean was hit by marine heatwaves that were classed as strong or worse, the greatest extent ever recorded.The high temperatures are known to disturb fish and kill some of the plants they feed on. Mass-mortality events have repeatedly struck the Mediterranean in recent years as marine heatwaves have grown hotter.Karina Von Schuckmann, a scientist at Mercator Ocean, said: “One particular aspect that is quite concerning … is this repeat emergence of heat stress. If you repeat the heat stress over time, the vulnerability of these specific ecosystems increases.”Explore more on these topicsExtreme heatClimate crisisEurope weatherEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And when the Environment Agency finally funded research that uncovered real dangers, they buried it.”Sewage sludge – the solid byproduct of wastewater treatment – is promoted as a sustainable fertiliser that returns nutrients to the soil, but it can also carry toxic substances from industrial and domestic waste. Before the practice was banned in the 1990s, sludge was routinely dumped at sea; now it is spread on land.‘Like fly-tipping’: ministers ignoring pleas to cut sludge fertiliser useRead moreRules since 1989 only require the sludge to be tested for a narrow range of heavy metals. Other substances, including pharmaceuticals, Pfas “forever chemicals”, flame retardants, microplastics, endocrine disruptors, are neither regulated nor tested for.Voluntary guidance drawn up in 1998 by the water industry, the safe sludge matrix, sets out what types of treated sludge can be spread and where. “The matrix is still in use,” the insider said. “It was written by the water companies and simply accepted by the Environment Agency.”An industry expert agreed, saying: “It’s a PR exercise. The treatment doesn’t remove a huge range of pollutants, just pathogens.” A second EA source said the matrix was designed to “protect [companies’] access to the land bank” – to reassure farmers and fend off regulation.The EA has long known sludge is a problem. In 2017, it commissioned a study to investigate. The insider said that although the study was praised internally, it then disappeared. “It was wiped. When journalists asked about it, the agency said it didn’t exist.”Greenpeace’s Unearthed teamuncovered the study through freedom of information legislation. It revealed flame retardants, dioxins and microplastics had been identified in sludge samples.“The EA denied its existence until the evidence was overwhelming. Then they said, ‘OK, it exists, but we’re not giving it to you,’” the insider said.After the report’s exposure in 2020, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the EA announced a new sludge strategy to modernise the system and bring it under environmental permitting, with promises of better tracking, data and enforcement. But nothing has been delivered.“It was political theatre,” the insider said. “Throw out a strategy, let it sit on the shelf, say it’ll be reviewed next year. Hope the public forgets.”If the agency had been serious, they added, it would have expanded the list of substances water companies must test for. Instead, nothing changed. “The regulators and government are complicit. There’s too much money in sludge – cost savings and profits. Water companies have too much influence.”In 2024, the campaign group Fighting Dirty launched a legal challenge seeking stronger standards for sewage sludge, but lost.Georgia Elliott-Smith, Fighting Dirty’s director, said: “Water company executives and shareholders receive enormous payouts while environmental and health hazards are ignored. Worse, this suggests a deliberate pay-to-pollute arrangement. It’s sickening that water companies struck a deal with Ofwat allowing them to pass clean-up costs to consumers.

Chemicals in sludge pollute soils and crops, then run-off re-pollutes water. Monitoring focuses only on heavy metals. Government must set standards to restrict harmful agricultural chemicals and enforce polluter-pays rules.”“Regulation of sewage sludge is completely inadequate with monitoring focusing only on heavy metals. The government must move swiftly to set standards to restrict and enforce the levels of these harmful chemicals in use in agriculture, alongside setting tough ‘polluter pays’ responsibilities for the companies that are producing these pollutants in the first place.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We know sludge contains Pfas, plastics, and other chemicals – but we don’t know the impact on soils. Instead of stopping until we do, we carry on because real change costs money.”“Proper regulation –bringing contaminants in sludge down to safe levels – would cost more than burning or dumping it,” the EA insider said. “So they won’t do it. They’ll never set targets because the price is too high. The only fixes are to ban sludge spreading or stop toxic waste entering sewers – and Defra and the EA want neither. They just pretend change is coming.”Water UK acknowledged bioresources may contain Pfas and microplastics but said there are no legal standards or detection methods, and setting such standards is a matter for government and regulators. It said the industry is backing research and calling for coordinated international action.The EA said it enforces strict controls to prevent sludge from harming soil and water, including thousands of inspections and followup actions annually. Defra said it had launched an independent water commission to review sludge regulation and is working with the EA, farmers and companies to ensure safe use.Explore more on these topicsEnvironment AgencyPollutionFarmingnewsShareReuse this content"

But there was no time to ponder the ancestral forces that had brought him down into one of his province’s oldest mines. There was coal to dig for.New to the job, keeping up with colleagues was challenging. As he tried to crawl at speed under a conveyor belt of coal, he landed badly and sprained his wrist. He still can’t rotate it properly.Xu was desperate to leave the mine. He applied for scores of jobs, but along with millions of other young people who graduated during the pandemic, he discovered that few places were hiring. One company offered him a job on the other side of the country but it was too far from his family.View image in fullscreenAerial photo of coal mine in Lüliang, a city in Shanxi province.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianView image in fullscreenCoal trucks lined up on the road outside Lüliang.Photograph: Ding Gang/The Guardian“When I first graduated, I had big dreams, maybe a bit too ambitious,” the 26-year-old said, sitting outside the coal mine in the ancient city of Datong, Shanxi province, where he still works. Eventually he managed to transfer to a job in administration. “I hate the job of coal digging,” he said, his gleaming white Reeboks testament to the fact that he is now able to work above ground.Now, though, asChinacharges down the path of modernisation and away from the coal mines that powered the first few millennia of the country’s rise, Xu has found what he thinks is a brighter future in his home province of Shanxi. He’s finding part-time work as a tour guide. “I truly love my hometown and hope that more people can see it – not just as a place full of coal dust and heavy pollution,” Xu said.Xu’s personal journey is one that Shanxi, China’s top coal producing province, wants to mimic on a grand scale. But the challenge is immense. With the lowest GDP growth in the country and a local economy that is heavily reliant on China’s most polluting resource, Shanxi’s fate in China’s green future is uncertain.Map of coal mines in ChinaChina has pledged to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Many experts believe that, thanks to the rapid growth of clean energy systems, China’s emissions willpeak ahead of schedule, possibly as soon as this year. Now, as China’s policymakers develop the 15th five year plan, the economic and planning document that will lay out the priorities for the period between 2026 and 2030, analysts are watching closely to see how China’s green agenda will be balanced against social and economic concerns.In April, Xi Jinping, China’s leader, said: “No matter how the international situation changes, China will not slow down its efforts to address climate change”. He also spoke of the need for a “fair transition”. That question is of particular importance to the 35 million people of Shanxi.View image in fullscreenZhuangshang Village, Shanxi Province.Photograph: Ding Gang/The Guardian*****Shanxi is at the heart of a transition that will have global, existential ramifications. In 2024, it produced 1.27bn tonnes of coal, more than India. If Shanxi was a country, it would be the second-biggest coal producer in the world, after China. That coal was dug up to feed a country whose energy demands are growing rapidly each year – at a pace that, until recently, the increases in renewable capacity have struggled to keep up with.Coalis by far the largest source of CO2 emissions from fuel in China. According to the World Bank, the transition from coal to clean energy is “the most important climate change mitigation action in the world.”Chart on coal productionIn recent years, China’s build-up of renewable energy has accelerated at a rate that has stunned even the most optimistic environmentalists. China is building more wind and solar power than the rest of the world combined, and in April its wind and solar power generation capacity surged to nearly 1,500 GW, exceeding fossil-fuel power for the first time. Recent analysis suggests that China’s CO2 emissions are in decline, at least for now.Graph on Chinese power generation capacityBut China’s leaders have pledged, repeatedly, that coal will continue to have a supporting role in China’s energy system. And when it comes to actual power generation in China’s energy mix, coal still accounts for nearly 60%,according to datafrom Ember, an energy think tank. This year’s government work report pledged to “increase coal production and supply capacity”, something that many in China’s system see as essential to ensuring energy security.Chart on coal capacity under constructionThe spectre of blackouts, which paralysed parts of China in 2021 and 2022, haunt local officials. A lack of air conditioning in China’s scorching summers can be fatal to the elderly and vulnerable, while industry grinds to a halt without electricity. People familiar with the conversations happening inside China’s planning offices say that the recent power outages in Iberia were pointed to as an example of the perils of over-reliance on seasonally unstable renewable energy. The government has not announced a clear timeline for coal phase out. “In every document on realising the dual carbon goals, and realising the energy transition, there is some kind of role or carveout for the coal industry,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, the co-founder of Centre for Research onEnergyand Clean Air, a think tank.Nevertheless, with improvements in battery storage technology and power grid modernisation, the direction of travel away from coal seems clear. Prices are already in decline, as are coal imports.“As soon as China starts to reduce its coal reliance, Shanxi province is going to be more directly hit,” said Tom Wang, a Shanxi native and climate activist. He fears the consequences of mass unemployment. “A machine can sit around getting rusty. But a person will have to be fed. A person will have a family to support … It’s about survival. It’s about how you can live with dignity”.View image in fullscreenCoalball Coffee in Taiyuan, Shanxi province.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianView image in fullscreenSouvenirs in Taiyuan, Shanxi province.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianEverywhere you look in Shanxi, there is coal. Mines dot the arid landscape. Lumbering coal trucks share the highways with sleek new electric vehicles. In Taiyuan, Shanxi’s capital, there is even a coal-themed cafe, selling coal-inspired drinks and cutesy anthropomorphised lumps of coal. “It represents Shanxi,” explains the young barista. “As long as the rest of the country needs it, we will provide it”.Shanxi province mapAround one in ten people in the province are employed in coal and related industries. “My grandfather, my father, my maternal grandmother, and even my aunt – they all work in the coal industry. They don’t want to see the coal enterprises shut down,” Xu said.The world is littered with communities that have been left behind by modernisation. When towns in the Appalachian mountain range in the US lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs in the 1990s and 2000s – a process which accelerated when China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001 – opioid-related deaths increased significantly.And China has its own examples, too.The provinces of north-east China, known collectively as Dongbei, saw widespread factory closures in the 1990s when China shifted from a planned to a market economy. Millions of workers lost their jobs, and crime rates rose. Even today, the region, which has struggled to recover, is known as China’s Rust Belt.Local officials are well aware of this problem. Shanxi’s provincial work report for this year said that getting rid of the “excessive dependency” on coal “still requires hard work”. More than 1.7m coal-related jobs are expected to vanish by the end of the decade, creating an economic time bomb for local officials.One strategy has been to develop Shanxi’s tourism industry. Young entrepreneurs like Xu are at the forefront of that drive. He wants his home city of Datong to avoid the fate of rust belt cities, such as Hegang, a mining city in Dongbei’s Heilongjiang province that is now one of the poorest places in China. “It’s also a resource-depleted city,” Xu said. “So perhaps one day, our city, Datong, might end up like Hegang. But where we’re stronger than Hegang is that Datong has a deep cultural and historical heritage. So maybe when that time comes, young people will start leaving, but if I start working early in the tourism industry here in Datong – in the cultural tourism sector – then maybe I won’t have to leave when that time comes.”*****View image in fullscreenTourists at Xiaoxitian temple.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianView image in fullscreenGuangsheng temple.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianAs with its rich reserves of coal, Shanxi has abundant cultural resources – it just hasn’t quite figured out how to use them. Nowhere is this more apparent than Linfen, a small town of just 90,000 people and a few ancient temples. During last year’s National Day holiday, its population briefly doubled when 91,000 tourists flocked to the town, a year-on-year tourism increase of 335%, according to local authorities.The sudden rush of tourists to two previously little known temples deep in China’s coallands is thanks in part to the viral popularity of a Chinese video game,Black Myth: Wukong, which was released last year. Based on classic Chinese mythology, the game includes intricate reconstructions of temples including Xiaoxitian and Guangsheng in Linfen. Both sites have since rapidly plastered themselves with Black Myth merchandise. Guangsheng erected a 7ft statue of the Destined One, the game’s staff-wielding monkey hero, at the entrance to the prayer halls.View image in fullscreenThe Black Myth Monkey King sculpture in front of Guangsheng temple.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianView image in fullscreenPoster of Black Myth: Wukong at Xiaoxitian temple.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianBut the transformation into a tourist hotspot hasn’t been a totally smooth one. Some visitors grumbled that the car park at Xiaoxitian was hard to navigate. The nearby accommodation options are limited. A 43-year-old photographer surnamed Li said that visiting Xiaoxitian felt “immersive” after playing the Black Myth video game. But sometimes, he said, ruminating on the fake cultural relics that have been built in nearby towns, “you feel they have spent their money in the wrong place”.Wang Xiaoqi and Yu Peishi, tourists at Guangsheng temple, agreed. Aged 72, they have not played the Black Myth video game. But Shanxi has not learned how to tell its own story, they said. Take London’s Big Ben as an example, Wang said. It is “much, much younger” than the relics in Shanxi, “but its fame is much, much greater”. The UK has a better public relations strategy, Yu chimed in, resting with his puppy in a rucksack on his lap. “Everyone in the world knows about it. It’s about cultural influence. Here, it’s more regional, lacking in that kind of vision and global reach”.View image in fullscreenTourists Wang Xiaoqi and Yu Peishi at Guangsheng temple.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianShanxi isn’t just betting on tourism. It is also trying to incorporate China’s nationwide renewables boom into the local economy.By the end of last year Shanxi’stotal installed capacityof clean energy reached 61.89 GW, roughly the same asthe UK’s. More than half of that came from solar, whichreached 34.8 GWlast year. In 2022, one of China’s biggest solar companies, LONGi, opened a solar panel factory in Datong, which now employs over 160 people. More than half of the workers come from the coal industry, the company said.graphOther companies from Shanxi’s coal-dominated economy are hoping to reinvent themselves as part of China’s “clean coal” future.Meijin Energy, based in Taiyuan, Shanxi’s capital, is one of China’s biggest private coke companies. Founded in 1981, the company has the capacity to process more than 6m tonnes of coal each year, and 11m tonnes of coke. Its headquarters is a sprawling factory complex on the outskirts of the city. According to the company’s chairperson Yao Junlian, Shanxi is the “vanguard of the national energy revolution”.A desire to be part of this revolution led the company to start developing a hydrogen fuel in 2016, turning a byproduct of the coking process into clean fuel for vehicles. Sitting in the offices of the shiny new hydrogen division of the Taiyan compound, Ma Kai, a general manager, explained: “In the past, during the coking process, we might have just burned off or discharged the coke oven gas directly. First, that caused air pollution and had a negative environmental impact. Second, it meant we weren’t fully realizing the value of the resources.”View image in fullscreenMeijin Energy hydrogen refuelling station in Taiyuan, Shanxi province.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianView image in fullscreenWorkers at Meijin Energy refuelling with hydrogen.Photograph: Ding Gang/The Guardian“Now, we extract and turn all the valuable components contained in the coking process into usable products. This not only maximizes the value of the raw materials and improves our overall efficiency, but also plays a crucial role in environmental protection.”Meijin’s site in Taiyuan has an annual production capacity of more than 1,500 tonnes of hydrogen. Much of this goes back into the coal eco-system. Shanxi’s highways are loaded with lane after lane of towering coal trucks, some 500,000 in total, according to Ma. As Shanxi tries to decarbonise its transport sector, hundreds of hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, many made by Meijin, have started to join their ranks.But experts are sceptical about the benefits of this kind of coal-to-chemical processing in the green transition. Even Ma acknowledged that it was a “contradiction” that the production of this clean fuel required digging up and burning one of the dirtiest resources. “There is no explanation that I know of about why the coal-to-chemical industry would be part of the clean utilisation of coal,” Myllyvirta said. The concept of ‘clean coal’ is “the way that the policymakers hedge between clean energy and coal to ensure that the coal industry has a role to play in the transition.”View image in fullscreenWorker at Meijin Energy.Photograph: Ding Gang/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Meijin Energy.Photograph: The GuardianAnd the numbers so far are tiny. Meijin employs over ten thousand people in Shanxi, with fewer than 100 in the hydrogen sector. Hydrogen accounts for less than 5% of the company’s revenue. Last year, the company recorded a loss of more than 1.1bn yuan, which it attributed to plummeting coke prices amid an economic downturn.Wang, the activist, believes that the answer to such economic challenges is to move away from coal entirely. “I’m not really a believer in the existence of the coal industry, because as soon as you dig it out, there are greenhouse gas emissions”. Instead, Wang believes Shanxi has the potential to build a thriving economy, powered by its massive installations of clean energy, that can sustain the province without the need for coal.But Shanxi’s fate isn’t entirely in its hands. Two-thirds of the coal mined in Shanxi is exported to other provinces. Shanxi is “the heart of the entire country,” said Xu, the former miner, “continuously sending out energy and fresh blood to the rest of China”.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaCoalFossil fuelsEnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The constituents, including parents and pensioners, doctors, teachers, farmers and youth campaigners, have arranged to lobby at least 500 MPs, about 80% of the total.Before the event,a giant image created by the People’s Picture, stating that “89% of people want climate action”, was projected on to the white cliffs of Dover. The Guardian reported in April on theclimate “silent majority”– 89% of people around the world want more to be done but mistakenly assume that few people share their view.The mosaic image, featuring a green heart, was created from 1,500 photos shared by people to illustrate what they want to protect.The mass lobby and image were organised bythe Climate Coalition, a network of more than 120 UK organisations representing more than 22 million people, including the National Trust, the RSPB and the Women’s Institute. MPs will be asked to secure a green future to cut energy bills and create jobs, restore nature and help the communities hit hardest by climate change, in the UK and around the world.New polling data shared with the Guardian provides further evidence of the climate silent majority, with many British people backing net zero goals but just one in 10 saying they regularly share their climate views.Helen Meech, the executive director of the Climate Coalition, said: “Right across the UK, people are stepping up to protect the things they love, from clean air and green spaces to secure jobs and warm homes. This is one of the biggest democratic moments for climate and nature in years and a chance to show that acting for our future is not just popular, it’s essential.”Charlotte Howell, a co-director of Parents for Future, said: “As parents, our greatest priority is to keep our children safe and healthy, right now and in the future. We are making it clear to MPs that climate action isn’t optional, it’s critical.”Tanya Steele, the WWF chief executive, said: “Today’s mass lobby of MPs must be a turning point, a moment to show our leaders that we, their constituents, want to live in a country where people and nature can thrive together.”The mass lobby was supported by dozens of public figures including the broadcasters Konnie Huq and Stephen Fry, the actors Brian Cox, David Harewood and Bonnie Wright and the writers Ben Okri and Mark Haddon. Okri contributed a photo to the Dover image of a favourite tree, felled by a storm. “The destruction of forests across the world is a silent modern tragedy,” he said.View image in fullscreenBen Okri and his family ‘adopted this tree as a family friend. We were saddened when it died. So we keep alive its spirit.’Photograph: Marcus LyonThe mosaic includes a photo from a parks manager in Antrim who said nature was her sanctuary, one from an academic in Southsea who said the seafront held many happy family memories, and one from a vicar in London of his community garden.Keir Starmer sent a message to those lobbying their MPs, saying: ​​ “The issues you are discussing today are central to my commitment to tackling climate change, both here in the UK and around the world.”He said the government was “doubling down” on Britain’s clean energy strengths, spending billions to make homes more energy efficient and funding climate adaptation for millions of people around the world. “Together, these actions reflect our unwavering commitment to climate action, energy security and social justice,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But they’re wrong | Rebecca WillisRead moreA survey byClimate Barometerfound that only one in 10 British people say they regularly express their climate views. About two-thirds of Britons support the 2050 net zero target, local solar parks and local windfarms, but half of those supporters remain either silent or quiet on climate issues, the survey found.Dr Niall McLoughlin, a co-director of Climate Barometer, said one cause of this hesitation could be “perception gaps”, where people believe their views on climate issues are not shared by others. “That isn’t the case at all,” he said.For example, just 16% of people thought there would be majority support for new pylons and power lines to carry renewable energy locally, when in reality 60% of the public support this.“It’s now crucial to break this spiral of silence if we want to make progress on climate change,” McLoughlin said. “Sharing support for climate action with people we meet can play a key role in driving forward change. There’s no time to waste – public figures and politicians should show real leadership.”Survey findings released in Junefrom 13 countries representing almost half the world’s population found that 77% of people are more willing to support a political candidate who prioritises taxing polluting companies such as oil, gas and coal firms and the super-rich, who havehuge carbon footprints.Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsThe 89% projectClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

The mother and father said the victims of the attack deserved an apology and that they wanted to see “meaningful, substantial change to ensure no child will ever share our daughter’s experience again”.View image in fullscreenThe three children who died in the knife attack, from left: Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar.Photograph: Merseyside Police/PAThe inquiry is examining the missed opportunities to prevent the killing of Bebe King, six; Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven; and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine; and the attempted murder of 10 others on 29 July last year.Sir Adrian Fulford, the chair, said on Tuesday the inquiry wouldexamine the “wholesale failure”of multiple institutions to prevent “one of the most egregious crimes in our country’s history”. Rudakubana wasjailed for a minimum of 52 yearsin January.Giving evidence atLiverpooltown hall, the seven-year-old girl’s mother said she wanted to highlight the courage shown by her daughter and the other children on that “horrific” day.The youngster, who can be identified only as C1, shielded other girls from the attacker as he rained down blows with a 17cm kitchen knife.Occasionally breaking to stop her tears, her mother said: “She tells me with such clarity that a moment came where one of the girls was able to get up, she put the girl’s hand on the handrail and told her to go – to get down the stairs – and she did.”The girl told her mother how she “crouched over the top of her. I told her it would be OK”, adding: “It happened so fast, but I helped them, I’m glad I could help them, Mum.”Her mother told the inquiry: “She recalls this with such purpose and determination, like it was her responsibility.”She said her daughter’s courage had left her “crushed and in complete awe”, and that it was an “uncomfortable and often unspoken truth” that the adults had initially left to call police.She said: “When the adults left in those first moments, our daughter had to save herself. It is these untold stories of remarkable strength and bravery that are missing when we have heard other accounts of this day.”Comforting her daughter through the trauma, she said, was like “sucking out poison”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She bears the scars, both physically and emotionally, of that terrible day,” he said.The mother of another girl, who escaped the attacker, said her “strong, brave and beautiful” daughter now struggled to sleep at night, was afraid of open doors and sometimes could not go to school because of anxiety, instead hiding under the dining table. “She asks: ‘How will I ever be normal again?’”Another seven-year-old girl, known as C8, could not be left alone and only felt safe with immediate family or close friends, her mother said. The sight of older boys in school uniform had become a “major trigger”, she added, since they unintentionally saw a picture of Rudakubana wearing his school uniform on the front page of a national newspaper.The mother said: “My daughter and all the people there that day have witnessed horrors that no one should ever see and I don’t think I will understand the impact on her until she is grown up.“I am grateful beyond words that she survived.

The invitations are sent to MPs directly from the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) office and forwarded by party whips.“The PLP office has literally become a public affairs agency,” one MP said. “The wording is genuinely shocking.”An invitation for a summer reception in London said it would be an MP-only event and an “opportunity for members of the PLP and frontbenchers to relax in a private setting with senior party figures as we return from the summer recess”.The PLP reception would be hosted in partnership with the property developerVistry, the invitation said, and it included a lengthy advertising pitch for the company. “As the country’s largest homebuilder, we leverage our expertise, skills and scale to deliver quality new housing,” it read, going on to promote Vistry’s timber-manufacturing capability.A party source said attendance was optional but at least one invitation made it clear there was an expectation to attend. “These bi-annual events are important for the party, so your attendance would be greatly appreciated,” one said.MPs are understood to have complained about the explicit corporate nature of the event on an MPs WhatsApp group.A similar event hosted for Labour MPs in the north-west has been sponsored byMitie, the facilities management company that provides outsourcing services. One MP said this was directly at odds with Labour’s stated values to return to insourcing services.This week MPs were invited to attend a “kickstart economic growth PLP reception” with “important speakers” at Mastercard’s headquarters that had been arranged so MPs would have time to return to vote in the Commons. “PLP staff are on hand outside and in the venue,” the invitation read.The credit card company also hosted a reception for Labour MPs in the north-west, with the PLP office invitation offering a tour of Mastercard’s “experience centre”, where the company would demonstrate “some of the cutting-edge technology and innovation that’s supporting small businesses”.MPs have previously complained about a winter reception, held for the London regional group of MPs, being sponsored by the communications consultancy Kanda.The invitation included a lengthy advertising blurb for Kanda, which said the company worked with clients “to understand, navigate and respond to the commercial drivers impacting the real-estate sector, including government legislature [and] local issues”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has since decidednot to go ahead with the project.Members of the PLP group of MPs from the north of England said they were frequently invited to commercial briefings, including with BP Teesside, Yorkshire Water and the British Association of Independent Exploration Companies that lobbies on behalf of the North Sea energy industry.

Her six novels and two short story collections include The Translator, Elsewhere, Home and, most recently, 2023’s River Spirit.“This comes as a complete and utter surprise,” said the writer on hearing the news. “For someone like me, a Muslim Sudanese immigrant who writes from a religious perspective probing the limits of secular tolerance, this recognition feels truly significant. It brings expansion and depth to the meaning of freedom of expression and whose stories get heard.”Aboulela was announced winner at English PEN’s summer party on Wednesday evening, where actors Khalid Abdalla and Amira Ghazalla read from her work. She will receive the award on 10 October at the British Library in London, where she will announce her choice of winner for the PEN Pinter Writer of Courage award, given to an author “active in defence of freedom of expression, often at great risk to their own safety and liberty”.Aboulela’s work “is marked by a commitment to make the lives and decisions of Muslim women central to her fiction, and to examine their struggles and pleasures with dignity,” said novelist Nadifa Mohamed, who judged this year’s prize alongside the poet and author Mona Arshi and the chair of English PEN, Ruth Borthwick. “In a world seemingly on fire, and with immense suffering unmarked and little mourned in Sudan, Gaza, and beyond, her writing is a balm, a shelter, and an inspiration.”Aboulela “offers us nuanced and rich perspectives on themes that are vital in our contemporary world: faith, migration, and displacement,” said Arshi.“She is not the first to write about the experience of migration, but Leila is a writer for this moment, and my hope is that with this prize her gorgeous books find new readers, and open our minds to other possibilities,” added Borthwick.Last year, Arundhati Roywon the prize, and selected the imprisoned British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah as Writer of Courage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

The environment secretary, Steve Reed, had been askedto claw back the payments.However, Montague said the board did not intend to recover the money, and suggested the two further tranches of bonuses could still be paid.In a letter to the committee’s chair, Alistair Carmichael, sent in June and published on Wednesday, Montague wrote: “The MRP was and remains paused. The board has not taken further decisions on the MRP at this stage.”Montague added that there had been no attempt from Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, or from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to recoup the funds that had already been paid.Thames is in a desperate race to raise funds and persuade the water regulatorto let it off hundreds of millions of pounds of finesor risk being renationalised.Ministers hadhoped to block bonusespaid from the loan under new legislation, but the rules limit the payouts that can be stopped to those at the very top of the company, such as the chief executive, the chief financial officer and the chair.The total planned payments are on average far more than double the salaries of the unnamed recipients, according to a table included in documents released by the committee. For instance, four people with salaries of up to £400,000 are due to receive up to £1.13m each – nearly three years’ extra pay – as long as they stay at the business for the next year.Minutes from a Thames board meeting, which was convened to discuss the bonuses, suggested the retention payments were designed to avoid the new legislation, which bans performance-related bonuses for water bosses.They read: “The [remuneration] committee requested to reconfirm whether the MRP was consistent with the Water (Special Measures) Act and related Ofwat consultation and it was confirmed that the MRP was a retention payment rather than a bonus, and had no performance-related element. As such, it was not restricted by the Water (Special Measures) Act.”However, payments to the company’s finance chief, Steve Buck, who was in line for a retention bonus to be paid in June, could be blocked, Reed indicated in a letter to the committee, also published on Wednesday.Reed said: “I expect Ofwat to assess whether Thames Water has breached the performance-related executive (chief executives and chief financial officers) pay prohibition rule with any of these payments and, if so, to take appropriate action.”The committee said it had recalled Montague and the chief executive of Thames Water, Chris Weston, for a hearing on 15 July.The bonuses came out of a controversial £3bn loan, which was meant to stabilise the company’s finances. The creditor loan, which waschallenged in court by rival bondholders, has an interest rate of 9.75%, plus fees. It was given by hedge funds, banks and other big investment firms that it already owes about £11.5bn, including Aberdeen, M&G, Elliott Management and Invesco.The same creditors are now the lead contenders to take over formal ownership of Thames in return fora further £5.3bn in equity investment and debt. They were forced to step in to avoid Thames Water collapsing into temporary nationalisation after theUS private equity firm KKR pulled outof a rescue deal.During a meeting with the environment committee in May, Montague told MPs that senior managers were in line for substantial retention bonuses because they were Thames’s “most precious resource”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Black said the ban was to be reviewed in 2027 but the date could be brought forward.Thames, which serves 16 million customers in London and south-east England, this week warned households it would announce a hosepipe ban unless the water shortage changed significantly.A Thames Water spokesperson said: “The MRP was established as part of the liquidity extension with the objective of retaining senior management during a complex recapitalisation that will see the company return to a stable financial and operational foundation …“Retention plans are commonplace in these types of deals for precisely this purpose and ours was based on extensive benchmarking of similar capital market events like M&A deals and restructurings.”A Defra spokesperson said: “Water company bosses, like anyone else, should only get bonuses if they’ve performed well, certainly not if they’ve failed to tackle water pollution.“As the independent regulator, we expect Ofwat to continue to examine any evidence of companies trying to circumvent the new rules and take appropriate enforcement action as necessary.”Explore more on these topicsThames WaterExecutive pay and bonusesWater industryUtilitiesCorporate governancenewsShareReuse this content"

He spent 52 days in jail earlier in the year but was released four months ago on technical grounds.A new style, tariff trouble, and no mention of Yoon: key takeaways from two hours with South Korea’s new presidentRead moreThe constitutional court ousted him as president in April, upholding parliament’s impeachment for the martial law bid, which shocked South Koreans and triggered months of political turmoil.The special prosecution team launched its investigation afternew leader Lee Jae Myung was elected in June, and it has been looking into additional charges against Yoon.The special counsel team is now expected to speed up its inquiry into allegations, including whether Yoon hurt South Korea’s interests by intentionally inflaming tensions with North Korea.Yoon, 64, attended the court hearing on Wednesday on the detention warrant, wearing a dark navy suit and a red tie, but did not answer questions from reporters. His lawyers have denied the allegations against him and called the detention request an unreasonable move in a hasty investigation.More than 1,000 supporters rallied near the court on Wednesday, local media reported, waving flags and signs and chanting Yoon’s name in 35C heat.In their warrant request, prosecutors said Yoon posed a flight risk, local media reported.Explore more on these topicsYoon Suk YeolSouth KoreaAsia PacificLee Jae MyungnewsShareReuse this content"

We cannot have a nation that is run by terror. We cannot have a nation that is governed by violence.“This country will not be destroyed by a few people who are impatient and who want to have a change of government using unconstitutional means.

The governmentwas forced to withdraw the finance billthat contained the proposed rises, and Rutodismissed nearly all of his cabinetin an attempt to control the situation.Police killings and abductions have done little to assuage public anger. Thedeath in police custody last month of a teacherwho had reportedly criticised a senior police official on social media, and the police shooting of a man at close range during a subsequent protest, has refocused attention on the security forces.On occasion, protests have degenerated into looting and violence by some protesters, with thousands of businesses destroyed.View image in fullscreenRiot police use teargas to disperse protesters in Kangemi on the outskirts of Nairobi.Photograph: Donwilson Odhiambo/Getty ImagesRuto was elected on a promise to improve the wellbeing of young and ordinary Kenyans, but many feel he has failed to deliver his economic pledges and has responded in a tone-deaf manner to protesters’ demands.Ruto’s latest comments echo an order to police from the interior minister, Kipchumba Murkomen, two weeks ago to shoot people who approach police stations “with criminal intent”.Opposition leaders, including Ruto’s former deputy and ally Rigathi Gachagua, have accused the government of unleashing “hostile” state-sponsored violence against its citizens. On Tuesday, they called on the public to “boycott all businesses, services and institutions owned, operated or publicly linked to this regime and its enablers”.Ruto’s allies have accused Gachagua of bankrolling violent protests, which he has denied. Gachagua also dismissed Ruto’s claims of a plot to overthrow the government, saying on Wednesday: “We want to remove you … through the ballot in 2027.”View image in fullscreenA protester looks on as a pyre of tyres burns in Nairobi on 7 July.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/Getty ImagesObservers say that Ruto has to endear himself both to a disillusioned public and to younger Kenyans – a strong-willed and defiant generation born after the restoration of multiparty democracy who benefited from free primary education that started in 2003, and who have been leading the push for change since last year.The UN said it was “deeply troubled” over the deaths during this week’s protests and that “intentional lethal force by law enforcement officers, including with firearms, should only be used when strictly necessary to protect life from an imminent threat”.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsKenyaProtestAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.”Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and later renamed it X. The billionaire hired Yaccarino the following year, after he fired much of the platform’s staff and announced major changes such as ending content moderation policies. Before joining X, Yaccarino had been a longtime executive at NBCUniversal who focused on advertising and partnerships. In March, Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI acquired the social networking company.Over the course of Yaccarino’s tenure as CEO, she frequently had to put a positive spin on public relations disasters and Musk’s belligerent behavior. A few months after hiring Yaccarino, Musk gave a public appearance in whichhe told advertisersto “go fuck yourself” and leave the platform after backlash to his promotion of an antisemitic post. Yaccarino defended his conduct and the company in interviews.Yaccarino’s own output on X often reflected the more congenial side of the platform and contained earnest retweets of celebrity birthdays or events. The CEO was often forced back into damage control mode, however, including denyingreports from the Wall Street Journalearlier this year that X had strong-armed companies to advertise on the platform by threatening lawsuits against them. Under Yaccarino, the company didsue advertiserswho had pulled back their spending after Musk’s acquisition and outbursts.The platform’s issues continued right up until Yaccarino announced her departure.

His political alliance with Donald Trump, which began during the 2024 campaign and resulted in Musk’s appointment as a special government employee and the creation of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, imploded in June in full public view. The two men clashed over the US president’s sweeping tax bill, which Musk called an “abomination”. The tech tycoon has committed to starting an independent political party dedicated to ousting Republican members from Congress who voted for the bill, which successfully passed.

He was cleared of the 2015 charge.Despite the custodial penalty, the Italian manager will not spend any time behind bars as non-violent, first-time offenders given sentences of less than two years are rarely sent to prison under Spanish law.Ancelotti, the most successful manager in Champions League history, is the latest high-profile football figure to find himself pursued in recent years by Spain’s tax authorities.

A close inspection of TV’s most shocking plot-holesA character just got bumped off for the second time in And Just Like That – but it’s far from the first show to mess up in this way. Just look at Friends!Stuart HeritageWed 9 Jul 2025 09.02 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 11.16 EDTShareNow in its third season, it’s safe to say that HBO’s Sex and the City revivalAnd Just Like Thathas struggled to capture the zeitgeist in the same way as its mother series. But that all changes now because, in its most recent episode, shrugged off its tired old premise to become something new. Now it is nothing less than a show about the miracle of human reanimation.The most recent episode was entitled Silent Mode. In it, Nicole Ari Parker’s character Lisa learned that her 90-year-old father had died. As she prepared to deliver a moving eulogy, sharp-eyed And Just Like That loyalists were all grabbed by the same sudden thought: wait, hadn’t he already died once before?They remembered the premiere of the series, when the characters were still reeling from the sudden Peloton-adjacent death of Mr Big, and Lisa told Charlotte: “I was exactly the same when my father died last year.”Now, some have claimed that this is lazy writing; all the major aspects of a character’s life – like how many parents they have, and the general impossibility of corporeal resurrection – should be kept in a show bible that is referenced ahead of any major plot points. However, I think it is more likely that all the characters from And Just Like That are simply members of a satanic voodoo death cult driven by the secret desire to Frankenstein all their loved ones back to life in order to kill them again, so they can revel in the hideous truth that they have become more powerful than God.Frasier was the rare show that not only noticed the goof but actively leaned into itAlternatively, the first dead dad was her stepdad. That’s the line the And Just Like That writers have hastily thrown together in the wake of the mistake, at least. Lisa had a stepdad, and he died, then her actual dad died a couple of years later. Would it have been easier to understand if Lisa – a character whom we had known for seconds at that point – had said “stepdad” instead of “dad” in the premiere? Possibly. But it’s too late to go back and fix that now.At the very least, And Just Like That can reassure itself that it’s not the only show to have messed up like this. When you’re making a long-running series with a large cast, it’s only natural to expect that some details will get mixed up along the way.View image in fullscreenGood dad, bad dad … Kelsey Grammer with John Mahoney in Frasier.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarOne notorious example isFriends. In the very first episode, Monica introduces Rachel – at that point a runaway bride – to all her chums. One of them is Chandler, whom she appears to be meeting for the first time. But as the series wore on and started to introduce flashbacks, we saw that Rachel had met Chandler several times previously; once shortly after getting engaged to Barry and twice more at family Thanksgiving meals. And these were only the times we saw. Perhaps Rachel had met Chandler hundreds of times before the start of the first episode. Maybe even thousands. Maybe, with this in mind, Friends actually becomes a heartbreaking tale of a woman struggling with the debilitating effects of transient global amnesia.Something similar happened inFrasier. When Frasier Crane was simply a side character on Cheers, he once mentioned that his father had been a scientist, but was now dead. But then came the Frasier spin-off, in which one of the main characters was none other than Frasier’s dad, depicted not as a corpse in a lab coat but a gnarled retired policeman. However, Frasier was the rare show that not only noticed the goof but actively leaned into it. Martin Crane was always a police officer, it was explained, but Frasier had lied about him out of embarrassment. If people had known that his dad was a street cop and not a highfalutin academic, then Frasier’s painstakingly assembled self-image would have crumbled into a pile of ashes. A continuity error transformed into an opportunity to deepen a character. How very Frasier.Perhaps this is something that And Just Like That can also use. Forget the wishy-washy stepfather line: let’s make Lisa an inveterate liar, who repeatedly invents bereavements in order to gain the trust of those around her. Wouldn’t that be a far more interesting direction in which to take the character? Either that or the death cult thing, which would at least liven up the show a bit.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFriendsAnd Just Like ThatFrasierfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They proposed a floating multi-species utopia where humans and dolphins could mingle in a watery fantasy, communicating through telepathy. The triangular vessel featured a land-water living room, with chutes enabling dolphins to swim between floors, as well as a shared navigation pod, where one day an “electronic-fluidic interface” would allow both humans and dolphins to steer the ship. The hope was that technological advances would make the project buildable by the 1990s. “Thus far,” the article noted, “no backers have come forward.”View image in fullscreenPractical solutions … Alusta Pavilion by Suomi/Koivisto architects.Photograph: Maiju Suomi/Elina Koivisto/Courtesy of the The Design MuseumFifty years on, there is still no delphinid mission, but Ant Farm’s acid-induced drawings are on display in the Design Museum, as part of an exhibition about current designers’ attempts to work with and for the “more than human” world. Today’s young architects might no longer be communing with their animal clients through psychedelics (alas!), but a whole new generation is engaging with the natural world once again, in the realisation that it’s not enough to mitigate the human impact on the planet: we must actively design for other species to flourish.The resulting show is an intriguing, if sometimes opaque, foray into numerous experiments and “collaborations” with nature, from fungal facades to fabrics grown from grass roots. Some are realistic proposals that have been put into action, while (too many) others occupy the realms of fantasy or conceptual art. But a good deal of exhibits will make you think again, and contemplate your relationship with everything from spiders and seaweed, to wasps and worms.View image in fullscreen‘Nature-based infrastructure’ … 3D-printed coral reefs.Photograph: Alex Goad/Courtesy Reef Design LabArchitect Andrés Jaque, who recently sprayed aschool in Spainwith a globular coating of insect and fungi-friendly cork, is back with an even more wildlife-welcoming facade. His “transspecies rosette”, a sample of a new cladding system made of pulverised cork and natural resin, features deep clefts and niches to encourage life to take hold, while providing waterproof insulation for the building. Modernism might have led to a wipe-clean world of sleek, seamless surfaces (all that high-rise glass resulting inaccidental bird massacres), but Jaque’s work suggests that more-than-human-centric design could lead to much more interesting, knobbly kinds of architecture. Does a bio-gothic future await?View image in fullscreenKnobbly cladding … the ‘transspecies rosette’ by Andrés JaquePhotograph: Oliver WainwrightNearby, Kate Orff of landscape architecture firm Scape, presents her more pragmaticBird-Safe Building Guidelines, showing how the differences between human and avian vision could be turned to advantage. By applying films, glass can be made to look opaque to birds, while remaining transparent to humans. This simple measure could save a billion bird deaths a year, in the US alone.There are a handful of practical solutions like this scattered throughout the exhibition, but at several points in the show you feel like reminding the curators their remit is design, not art. There are a few too many space-filling installations, like Julia Lohmann’sKelp Council, which looks like a series of couture dresses fashioned from seaweed, dangling in a circle, set to a bubbling backdrop of oceanic sounds.“If we consider that all living things have their own needs and agency,” offers a caption, “we might ask: what does seaweed think of us?”Quoth the kelp: “Do better.”Other projects seem promising, until you realise they have yet to be tested in the real world. There is a reason so many designers gravitate towards the ethereal realms of installation art and “research”, of the kind that now fillsbiennales: it’s a lot easier to comment on a problem than solve it.The seaweed might be envious of a project around the corner, made in collaboration with its more primitive relative, red algae. Australian designer Jessie French has developed an organic algae-based vinyl as an alternative to synthetic window decals, contrasting the few weeks it takes for algae to grow with the many hundreds of years it takes for man-made plastics to decompose. The museum considered using it for the exhibition signage, but the carbon footprint of shipping it from Australia sadly put paid to that idea.View image in fullscreenNatural fibres … woven grass fabric by Diana Scherer.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightElsewhere there are some ingenious examples of “nature-based infrastructure”, from 3D-printed coral reefs and sea walls, full of little ridges and holes to encourage marine life, to floating breakwaters that mitigate storm surges, which are also designed as habitats for oysters. Indigenous wisdom gets a look-in too, with baskets woven by the Ye’kuana people of the Venezuelan Amazon, who ask the permission of the forest before using its products, and a film that highlights the Inga people of the Colombian Amazon and their hallucinogenic use of ayahuasca. Just like the Ant Farm collective, it sometimes takes a little something extra before we can fully communicate with our more-than-human cousins. An altered state might help the exhibition-goers, too.In the end, it is (perhaps appropriately) nature itself that steals the show. Each section begins with a group of historic artefacts in vitrines, including a beautiful collection of animal nests. Marvel at the grotto-like wood pulp habitat of the European wasp, or the dainty nest of a hummingbird, fashioned from antibacterial lichen and cobwebs for elasticity, or the tiny clay capsule of the solitary potter wasp, hanging from a branch. The female wasp sculpts these little pots from mud and saliva, before laying an egg inside and stocking it with provisions of paralysed caterpillars. Now there’s some more-than-human maternal cunning.More than Human is at theDesign Museum, London, from 11 July–5 October.Explore more on these topicsArt and designDesignAnimalsArchitectureInsectsExhibitionsWildlifereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is about the country’s leaders’ addiction to rightwing Christian fundamentalism and US-style prayer breakfasts, a strident political mannerism linked to the fact that evangelical Christians make up an estimated 30% of the population; it is on their behalf that Brazil’s religious right, via its substantial bloc vote in Congress, has now created what amounts to a minority-rule theocracy.This movement was originally imported after the second world war through colossal enthusiasm for the ministry of Billy Graham, and it was covertly encouraged by the US government. The evangelists and their fellow travellers show a particular enthusiasm for the Book of Revelations, whose apocalyptic rhetoric is used to amplify and justify all manner of conspiracist, xenophobic screeching.The tone is set by televangelists like the always angry Pastor Silas Malafaia, interviewed at some length here; he is a man clearly thrilled and energised by his own national celebrity and wealth, though irritated by questioning about his private plane, whose value, he says, has depreciated from over a million dollars new to about $800,000. (Perhaps this means that the needle’s-eye that we’re squeezing the camel through has correspondingly increased in size by around 20%.) Malafaia is someone for whom an ear-splittingly shrill and boorish rant about gays and communists is a natural mode of communication.The Christian caucus helped deliver the fiercely reactionary, blandly self-satisfiedJair Bolsonaroto the Brazilian presidency in 2019, though Bolsonaro’s callous and incompetent handling of Covid probably sowed the seeds for quiet discontent with his posturing rule. But the film also shows that the Workers’ Party ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – known universally as “Lula” – ran again for the presidency and was careful to court the evangelical vote. He won in 2022 – and Bolsonaro, in fine Trumpian style, refused to concede, encouraged a coup and incited his supporters to storm government buildings. (The film shows one of them actually taking a dump on an official desk.)Bolsonaro was finally discredited, although the history of extremism is littered with cases in which imprisonments, disgraces, prosecutions and the like are merely career-phase setbacks to be spun by partisans as “lawfare” oppression by the deep state.And what now – is Lula simply the Brazilian Biden, ageing and uninspiring? Will someone else be the second coming of the Brazilian far right – could it be the gruesome Pastor Malafaia himself perhaps? Or would he find the subsequent press scrutiny of all his personal dealings disagreeable? Democracy has never looked so vulnerable.Apocalypse in the Tropics is in cinemas from 11 July and on Netflix from 14 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsBrazilChristianityJair BolsonaroAmericasReligionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Now Perry has made a film about Pavement and it seems to be his intention here to avoid, strenuously and at all costs, obviousness – and perhaps the most clunkingly obvious thing for any newbie to ask about is the name. Pavement as opposed to Sidewalk because of a Brit affectation? No: just a functional name chosen almost at random and one that sounded right.Intriguingly, but finally a bit frustratingly, Perry is running four ideas at once, a kind of cine-quadriptych with the plurality signalled by the title. Firstly, it’s a documentary about Pavement’s return to live performance in 2022, complete with milky, blurry analogue video flashbacks to their 90s heyday. Secondly, an account of a touring museum exhibition about the band. Thirdly: a study of a jukebox musical project about Pavement called Slanted! Enchanted! after one of their albums, which had a three-day off-Broadway workshop presentation. And finally, a conventional fictional dramatisation of the band’s history, entitled Range Life, of which we see a few clips, with Joe Keery as lead singer Stephen Malkmus, Nat Wolff as guitarist Scott Kannberg, Fred Hechinger as singer Bob Nastanovich andJason Schwartzmanas Matador Records chief Chris Lombardi. But it isn’t entirely clear whether Range Life really exists as a standalone film, or how to judge or imagine its independent existence. We get a scene showing the actors doing an onstage Q&A after a screening, and it doesn’t look like a fictional spoof.In the end, I wanted to see just one of these strands developed to feature length, perhaps especially the hilarious-sounding stage musical idea with Pavement tracks reinvented as showtune zingers. As it stands, Pavements doesn’t have the clarity and punch of, say,Ondi Timoner’s psych-rock documentary Dig!, or the dramatic cogency of Perry’srecent 90s rock drama Her Smell. It is a palimpsest of approaches: four concepts placed on top of each other, but none can be seen clearly. For me, Perry’s masterpiece is still his 2015drama Listen Up Philip. But this film might well provide something for the Pavement fanbase.Pavements is on Mubi from 11 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmMusic documentaryPavementDocumentary filmsStephen MalkmusJoe KeeryJason SchwartzmanreviewsShareReuse this content"

Or a moving tribute? Netflix’s mashup of Love is Blind, The Circle and The Voice certainly claims the latterRebecca NicholsonWed 9 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 11.55 EDTShareNetflix’s new series is the latest in a long line of TV shows attempting to talent-spot the next big pop phenomenon. It feels as if the format has been dormant for a while, its role as A&R taken over by social media aeons ago. The glory days of American Idol and The X Factor have passed, and while The Voice trundles steadily on, it has been many years since those on-screen machines churned out the stars they were once capable of creating.Building the Band aims to modernise the format by bolting on parts of other reality TV shows. Its wannabe singers perform to other singers, sight-unseen, who then decide whether they’d like to be in a band with each other, by pressing a button, and collecting “likes”. It is Love Is Blind meets The Circle meets The Voice, though mostly it is The Voice, replacing celebrity judges, in the early stages, with peers.Though he does not appear in the first batch of episodes, Liam Payne features as a guest judge further down the line, alongside Kelly Rowland and Nicole Scherzinger. Payne died, aged 31, last October, and this is his final project. There has been some backlash already, questioning whether the show should be released at all. Some have seen it as a ghoulish enterprise: it is easy to see how watching Payne return to the kind of reality show that made him a star, knowing where and how his story came to an end, would be uncomfortable. The show chooses to frame its release as a tribute. Presenter AJ McLean, of the Backstreet Boys, opens the series with a sincere acknowledgment of Payne’s “deep love for music”, acknowledging that they “never imagined we’d soon be saying goodbye to our friend”.As a reality show, it is fine, watchable, well-crafted, leaving sufficient cliffhangers to keep you pressing play, though its first four episodes do begin to feel a little drawn-out and repetitive. There are 50 singers, each in their own pods, or “sound booths”. Everyone auditions as an individual. Six bands will be formed, each having between three and five members. Everyone has a maximum of 10 likes, which they can use, Voice-like, by thumping a big button. If a singer gets fewer than five likes, they are out. If they run out of people who have liked them, because they have formed other bands, then they are also out. It is not as mathematically demanding as it sounds.All of the singers, or at least the ones we see performing, are professional-sounding and highly competent, in that belting-it-out, face-slappingly emotional, semi-strained sort of way. (As a point of contrast, watch old clips of Pop Idol or Pop Stars: The Rivals auditions on YouTube, if only to see how singing has evolved over the last 25 years. It’s the difference between a bicycle and a Maserati.) In these early stages, the critiques are left to the performers themselves, and mostly, they offer these with tact, rather than cruelty. There are none of the old “bad for comic effect” auditions here. The rejections, when they come, are swift, but heartfelt, and McLean is left to deliver the bad news.Eventually, as those who impress most move into their bands, they perform together for the first time, when they are able to see who they’ve chosen as bandmates. As with Love Is Blind, you can tell whether there is chemistry or not in an instant. It reminds me of the moment when people finally see above the knee on Naked Attraction. They say one thing, but their expressions say something else entirely.At the end of this first batch of episodes, there are hints of a more ruthless reality show beginning to emerge, not least because the winning band will walk away with half a million dollars. People make promises to each other that they are not sure they can keep. There is aRegina Georgecharacter, one of those “I’m not afraid of conflict” reality show staples. The bands live and work together, 24/7. The respectful peer-to-peer notes of the sound booths may not be the enduring mood of the series.I did question why Building the Band would choose to focus on groups, in an era of solo singer dominance, but perhaps it has been designed less for making stars, and more for the dramatic spectacle. Whether that revives the format, or simply shifts it into a more standardised reality TV lane, remains to be seen. Incidentally, I keep calling it “Breaking the Band”, mostly because of the early 00s show Making the Band, but I do wonder if there might be something more to the slip.Building the Band is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

In using the mockumentary form to recount the radicalisation and eventual crimes of brothers Seán and Freddie Halpin (Paul St Leger and Alex Eydt), it creates haunting intrigue about their motives, and further layers on a lyrical indignation that strongly marks out Sau Dachi’s debut feature.Interviews with lovers, friends, colleagues and the authorities who later intervened, as well as faux archive footage, chronicle the dark descent of the fusional Halpin siblings; on the surface they are bright and artistically gifted jack-the-lads, deeper down traumatised by the loss of their mother to botched cervical cancer treatment. Séan, in particular, internalises this as a consequence of capitalism’s disregard for the little people – and focuses his ire on politician Paul Keogh (William Morgan), the brave-new-world-proselytising Minister for Change and Reform.Dachi’s refracted technique contributes to an almost claustrophobic sense of characterisation – not just of the Halpins, but also those who end up on their receiving end. But, as the brothers don animal masks and begin issuing threatening manifestos on YouTube, the film’s polemic and dramatic strands start to interfere with each other. Giving Freddie free rein to rouse the masses with fusillades of free verse, Dachi is clearly as indignant as the protagonists about modern society’s failings. But he also tries to use the mock interviews to question the Halpins’ sense of certainty: are they folk heroes, or blinkered bedroom revolutionaries high on their own supply?These cross-currents mean Suit Hung. Tied Tongue labours somewhat for resolution and clarity in its closing stages – and perhaps hedges its bets on the salient issue, whether revolutionary violence is ever justified. But communicating its anger with potent rhetoric, it’s the kind of engaged grassroots film-making that we need more than ever.Suit Hung.

Deeply eccentric, staffed by the barely employable, and permanently teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, St Anne’s hangs on, against all the odds. And then, in 1984, Ida Campbell turns up on the doorstep, in possession of a full scholarship and rather a lot of baggage.Sixteen years old and already an outcast, Ida is in flight from her hapless mother, her foul-tempered sister, the small community in the Western Isles to which they have been transplanted, and the nameless scandal that has ruined their lives. St Anne’s is to be Ida’s salvation, but it soon dawns on her that the school might not be quite the refuge she had hoped for.The school’s buildings were constructed by a Victorian lunatic. Its principal, Miss Christie, is a dusty combination of cold war paranoiac and Edwardian governess, insisting both on regular drills in preparation for nuclear attack and the importance of girls wearing their hair up. The rest of the staff, from lugubrious bluestocking teacher Vera Clarke (Classics) to “Loopy Linda” the English mistress, are antique, creepy, despairing or all three.In Havoc, Waits mines the rich seam of girls’ school fiction to delirious and rewarding effectThe exception – and one of our narrative guides through the mayhem – is geography teacher Eleanor Alston, clinging to hope and sanity as she approaches 40 in the aftermath of a failed love affair. Into this stagnant pool of scholarship is dropped the replacement for the late Miss Hamilton (history, ancient), the meek but regrettably presentable Matthew Langfield, an improbable ex-Westminster schoolmaster and St Anne’s first and only male teacher, and ripples ensue.Ida’s fellow students, having largely been deposited by parents indifferent to the school’s underwhelming reputation and keen only not to be bothered with details, are a restless bunch, prone to smooches, cliques, gossip (Cindy Riley, in the works shed, with the groundsman?) and outbreaks of insubordination. They have their queen bee, Diane Fulbrook, the dazzling head girl with ambitions to be a police officer; and their bad fairy, Louise Adler (almost certainly some relation to Irene, Sherlock Holmes’s rival). Louise is the school’s only Jewish pupil and spoken of in whispers; she has pushed one girl out of a window and set another on fire at the Tea Cosy cafe, and Ida has barely learned of her existence when she is told that they will be roommates. Then Diane is taken ill with a progressive neurological disorder that defies medical investigation. When, one by one, her fellow students develop similar symptoms, and diagnoses from demonic possession and Soviet poisonings to mass hysteria begin to circulate, inevitably suspicion falls on the newest arrivals.In Havoc, Waits mines the rich seam of girls’ school fiction to delirious and rewarding effect. There are welcome echoes of St Trinian’s – the shade of Alastair Sim hovers over the staffroom, comforting and anarchic at once – and there is abundant Ealing comedy in the madcap chases through school corridors and machinations in the lighting gallery during the school play. Yet beneath the comedy lies a distinctly unsettling undertone: the girls experience a convincingly visceral terror that edges towards Shirley Jackson territory and gives their hysteria an extra dimension. This, along with a genuine unexpectedness in the characterisation and a lot of very funny dialogue, loosens things up and brings real originality to the game. Combined with excellent pacing, a plot so deliciously thick you could stand a spoon up in it, and the boldness required to splice a darker thread into the narrative, it all adds up to a thoroughly satisfying contribution to a happily capacious genre.Havoc by Rebecca Wait is published by Riverrun (£16.99).

It’s in this building that the annualDevelop conferencehas been bringing together developers, publishers, students and journalists since 2006 – and during the three days of talks, roundtables and keynotes, it’s in the bar that everyone meets and unloads their theories and concerns about the state of the business.This year, after many months of cuts and closures, the mood has been dour. On Tuesday, I spoke to many coders, artists and studio heads who have had games cancelled, staff axed and deals obliterated; several senior developers predicted that the recent savage cuts to staff numbers and game projects will lead to a gaping black hole in the release schedules of many triple-A publishers in late 2026 and 2027. Grand Theft Auto VI was always going to be huge; now it’s looking like the only game in town.But there has been optimism at the event, too. An excellent panel discussion entitled Why Cultural Recognition is Crucial to the Future of the Games Industry saw Nick Poole, CEO of the trade bodyUkie, welcoming a more positive view of the industry among politicians and policymakers in Westminster. “Three years ago, understanding of games was scant, but just recently there’s been a massive amount of recognition,” he said. “Suddenly, politicians are talking to us about the educational reach of games; the power of games for young people as a channel of self-expression; we’ve seen the first games being prescribed on the NHS as a treatment for anxiety and depression – there’s a recognition that the cultural echo of games is far greater than the economic proposition.”View image in fullscreenStories about marginalised and diverse characters … Unpacking.Photograph: Witch BeamOn the fears surrounding the use of AI, especiallylarge language models, in game development, Cassia Curran, founder of consulting firm Curran Games Agency, had some positive advice: “The development of AI will mean there’s an abundance of content out there,” she said. “But the way that you can achieve success as a developer will be to lean into the authentic human experience you’ve lived. AI cannot reproduce your feelings or your culture, and these can be reflected in your games. In the era of AI slop, players will be looking for experiences that feel new and deeply human.”There were also some fascinating stories of the lengths developers have been going to in the quest for authenticity. In the first talk of the day, Jens Andersson and Pete Ward fromMachineGames, the creator of the acclaimed adventure Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, talked about travelling to the far north of Sweden to record a bull-whip expert cracking a whip in multiple different ways and locations to ensure Indy’s famous accessory sounded right in the game. The team behind the procedurally generated detective adventure Shadows of Doubt created a 1950s-style noir thriller called Claw of the Fathoms, which plays on the TV in the lead character’s apartment, simply to give the world an authentic feel.The sheer range of experiences in games and a growing concern with wider representation were the overriding themes all day. Lydia Cooke, a PhD researcher specialising in queer game studies, chaired a heartening roundtable discussion entitled Representation in Games: Beyond the Surface. Cooke talked of barriers to representation in mainstream games, where atypical characters are often seen as a commercial risk. But, at the same time, audience members listed recent games that told interesting stories about marginalised and diverse characters, including thenarrative puzzler Unpacking, Lesbian romance Bossgame: The Final Boss is my Heart, gender-neutral dating sim Monster Prom, and absurdist disability allegory To a T from cult game-maker Keita Takahashi. A key conclusion of the session was that identity needn’t be a central issue in a game – instead, the very presence in a game of well-drawn diverse characters may be of huge value to players who rarely see themselves represented in the media they consume.Away from the bar, I bumped into some of my favourite independent developers and they told me about the interesting projects they’re working on – innovative, charming games built by tiny teams, by any means necessary. For the rest of the conference, there will be talks from legendary Finnish developer Housemarque on surviving 30 years in the business; and from Remedy Entertainment’s Sam Lake on his three decades of storytelling. Developers will be sharing a multitude of experiences, from creating a side quest in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to how they made players cry with indie game Videoverse. In short, the work goes on, people make things and people play them. This is not just an industry controlled by CEOs and shareholders, it is a culture and an art form, and it will continue.What to playView image in fullscreenA compelling diversion … Angry Birds Bounce.Photograph: RovioAngry Birds is very much the Pac-Man of the mobile gaming world – a franchise that’s somehow infinitely renewable in a vast array of genres. The latest incarnation isAngry Birds Bounce, which combines the familiar slingshot-a-bird-to-hit-naughty-pigs gameplay with block-breaking classics such as Breakout and Puzzle Bobble. Simply select your favourite bird, then aim it at the screen to take out as many pigs as possible; each bird has different tactics and abilities, and the challenge ramps up nicely as you unlock new characters. Developer Rovio clearly still has enthusiasm for the series and this compelling little diversion will get you through any commute, dull movie or inescapable meeting.Available on:Apple ArcadeEstimated playtime:All the free time you haveWhat to readView image in fullscreenPriced out?

Bringing the story for young adults to life on stage, Tinuke Craig’s zippy, large-scale production confronts the audience anew.This modern Romeo and Juliet remains one of the most striking tales written for teenagers. The production is well suited for schools, giving young people the language and imagery to talk about racism here and now. But adapted by Dominic Cooke in 2007 for the RSC, the choppy script favours faithfulness to the book over inventiveness in exploring its new form.The cast bursts with sometimes overstated energy. In Blackman’s thought experiment, white people are Noughts, like Callum (Noah Valentine), downtrodden and degraded. Black people are Crosses, like Sephy (Corinna Brown). Crosses hold the power. This is a world where schools are segregated, juries are all-Cross and plasters are by default dark brown.View image in fullscreenHarsh world … Alec Boaden (Jude) and Chanel Waddock (Lynette) in Noughts & Crosses.Photograph: Manuel HarlanStarting out in their mid-teens, open-hearted best friends Callum and Sephy are forced to grow up fast as they wade through the crushing racial and class structures that pin them in their opposing places. Brown is buoyant as Sephy, desperate to do the right thing, her eyes slowly opening to her own privilege. Valentine is eager and angry as Callum, hardening fast at the harshness of the world picking his family apart.As in the novel, the play tears through the busy plot. While the story squares up to suicide, sex and capital punishment, each moment is sped through to get to the next. Though Craig’s direction is punchy and clear, the emotional impact frequently feels pushed aside in order to move on to the next scene. Cooke’s excessive use of direct address repeatedly tells us everything we need to know, rather than letting us work anything out for ourselves.The fights, chases and continual narrative lurches means time whizzes by, racing towards the play’s harrowing end, where grief bursts across the stage. More than two decades on, Blackman’s story of forbidden love and constant injustice remains damningly relevant, holding a cracked mirror up to its audience. A guttural cry pierces the night sky. Loss follows loss, and only anger remains.At Regent’s Park Open Air theatre until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreMalorie BlackmanRacereviewsShareReuse this content"

He paints in a white protective suit, photos reveal, as if paint was radioactive material or sewage. It’s a telling contrast with a real artist likeJenny Saville, who gets completely covered with paint like a naughty three-year-old, let alone Van Gogh, who ate the stuff.Sheeran isn’t claiming to be one of those artists – is he? He’s in it for fun and charity. And his paintings have more energy than you’d think from the prissy hazmat suit. He must have moved about a bit, flicking and pouring the fizzy greenish blues, hot orange, lime, mixing them as if making cocktails.‘It’s my creative outlet’ – Ed Sheeran turns to art in time off from touringRead moreBut there’s a problem. While he has successfully defeated plagiarism claims regarding his songs, he would have no defence from theJackson Pollockestate. His art is, let’s be polite, one big homage to the abstract expressionist painter who turned modern art on its head, showing that the body could see more than the mind with his hurled lines of flowing, tangled colours created in dance-like moves around horizontal canvases.Sheeran is right to love Pollock. But it’s cocksure and stupid to think you can reproduce his genius on your days off because, you know, it looks pretty easy. It wasn’t. This is where celebrity artists get it wrong: they think art is fun but art is suffering and madness. A Sheeran splash may ape a Pollock splash but there’s no feeling, no truth. Pollock put his inside self on canvas, luring you into a web of mental suffering and triumph.Abstract art like Sheeran’s gives all abstract art a bad name because it’s based on the dumb idea that doing your own is a breeze. I have more respect forRonnie WoodandBob Dylanwho attempt figurative paintings: you can mock but at least they take a risk in doing the kind of art people are quick to judge.Sheeran’s art is a slick con job. In painting his light, meaningless abstract concoctions, he avoids proper scrutiny and dips a toe into art without putting himself on the line. What a pro, even when he is an amateur.Explore more on these topicsEd SheeranPaintingJackson PollockArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the simplest explanation of how a movie likeThe Old Guard 2, a sequel to a generally well-liked Netflix action movie released in 2020, can be released five years after its predecessor without including the courtesy of an actual ending.Now, technically speaking, especially by the cliffhanging standards established by Star Wars and Marvel, The Old Guard 2 does have an ending (which will be spoiled in short order for clarity’s sake, so don’t read on if you haven’t seen it and want to experience a more organic disappointment). Andy (Charlize Theron), a centuries-old warrior who has lost and subsequently regained her healing powers of near-immortality, fights her enemy Discord (Uma Thurman) to a draw – which allows Discord to escape with the other members of Andy’s immortal team, so she may steal their healing powers. This seems to set up a final rescue/confrontation for the final 30 minutes of the film. Instead, Andy and her once-estranged bestie Quỳnh (Veronica Ngô) resolve to save their comrades. As they enthusiastically run off to do so, the movie ends.The Old Guard 2 review – Charlize Theron’s delayed Netflix sequel is an incomplete messRead moreThis suddenness may strike some viewers as a mercy. (The Old Guard 2 is pretty bad well before it punts its climax to another movie.) Narratively, it does vaguely resemble The Empire Strikes Back - except that the bad guy who gets the upper hand was only introduced in this sequel. That means the new movie doesn’t quite offer the full reversal that Empire does in relation to Star Wars, where Darth Vader was defeated at the end only to return with more physical and emotional firepower in Empire. Still, the idea seems to be a similar sense of characters picking themselves up and fighting on as they charge toward The Old Guard 3.On a more practical level, there’s a bigger issue at play: The Old Guard 3 does not, at present, exist. It has not been shot or greenlit. Both of those things could happen quickly, but on the other hand, The Old Guard 2 took years to make it toNetflix. (It was shot back in 2022, put on post-production pause during a Netflix executive shift, and returned for additional shooting last year.) Greg Rucka, the comics creator who also co-wrote the screenplays for the first two movies, has talked about wanting to make a trilogy, and The Old Guard 2 certainly acts as if that’s the plan. But it’s entirely possible that the series could end here.Similarly, it’s possible that 28 Years Later, envisioned as a trilogy with one sequel already sequel completed and release-dated, could leave off its final movie. The first movie (which, confusingly, is also the third in its series) is a hit, but has also polarized audiences. This could make the already-shot sequel due in January drop-off hard, and therefore give Sony second thoughts about financing the third movie, which hasn’t officially been greenlit. If it doesn’t happen, will the series need to wait another 10 or 20 years to build up enough goodwill and demand for a continuation?The scenario of maximum terror or, depending on your perspective, hilarity is the Divergent series. A planned four-film series based on the popular YA novels kicked off with a hit in 2014. But after the third film took a steep 50% dive from its predecessor in the US, the series was abruptly curtailed. A decade earlier, the DVD market might have been enough reason to go ahead with the fourth film anyway; this was not the case by 2016. (The idea of a wrap-up feature for TV was discussed, and apparently dismissed by the movie’s stars.) So now there are still just three Divergent movies, the last one ends with almost no resolution, and the chances of anyone ever agreeing to revisit the material seem close to nil. (Even sadder/funnier, this was a particularly unforced error: the third book in a trilogy had been split into two movies, as was the cash-grab style at the time.)This is an inevitable side effect of treating movies as serialized entries in franchises that will last at least three entries, if not forever; it becomes easier and easier to defer an actual ending far off into the distance, into the realm of projects that may never actually come to pass. Obviously some teases can work wonders; that moment at the end ofBatman Beginswhere Jim Gordon presents Batman with the Joker playing card and audiences went legitimately nuts with anticipation is a studio executive’s dream. But that works a lot better when the preceding movie feels complete.And as deflating as it feels to watch a movie that feels like it’s holding back certain ideas or elements for a sequel that may or may not get made, it’s doubly so to watch a movie that flagrantly holds back its own story – not even for another two-hour installment to follow in a few months, but in a kind of weird ransom situation: give us enough money and you can see how it turns out! That’s been the subtext of the 28 Years Later interviews that mention how original star Cillian Murphy appears briefly in the already-made sequel, but would feature more heavily in the unmade threequel. Presumably Murphy’s prestige and the series’ name-brand recognition will be enough to get that movie going. But it’s entirely possible an Oscar winner will wind up teasing a nonexistent resolution.View image in fullscreenAlfie Williams and Ralph Fiennes in 28 Years Later.Photograph: Miya Mizuno/APTo be fair, in some ways these risky cliffhangers have been created in part by adhering to conventional wisdom about how to build a movie series. Fanboy types love to talk about the importance of a big franchise plan, pointing to the zig-zagging recent Star Wars sequel trilogy as the ultimate example of the peril that awaits moving forward without a blueprint.But sometimes – often? - not having a specific plan for a sequel, trilogy, or 10-movie cycle with three TV spinoffs is a secret weapon. Some of the best sequels of the century so far – The Dark Knight; Star Wars: The Last Jedi; Avatar: The Way of Water – have been made with full knowledge that a third movie would very likely (or in some cases definitely) follow, and contain plenty of possible threads for that next installment. Yet those examples also pointedly avoid getting specific with their set-up, and provide highly satisfying endings to the stories at hand, rather than teasing audiences with specific hints about what’s to come or directly deferring major story developments to some later date.For that matter, I’m not fully convinced that some go-to examples of great cliffhangers that were guaranteed to be resolved, such as Empire or Infinity War, are actually all that impressive, either, at least from a narrative perspective. Empire at least has a major revelation, that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker’s father, for the audience (and the character) to sit with, making the break before Return of the Jedi seem more necessary. Infinity War, though, is just a lengthy rev-up to a non-ending disguised as a downer – a setback for the heroes to wriggle out of (or what used to be called the three-quarters mark). A lot of fans seem to have loved it more than the actual resolution – just as many viewers often appear more interested in long-gap legacy sequels to movies where they’d often stopped attending the sequels years ago.At the very least, making movies without a franchise map beats having a plan that inevitably depends on outside forces – viewership, cast participation, the right executives staying enthused – to actually execute. Leaving a cliffhanger like the one that not-really-ends Old Guard 2 seems like a misguided expression of faith that the audience will be excited rather than enraged. But it may also be a way of sharing the corporate-induced stresses of film-making with the audience. Suddenly it’s not just the film-makers wondering how or if a movie’s story can be finished up properly, and whether a franchise will be considered profitable enough to carry on. Now it’s the viewer’s problem, too.Explore more on these topicsFilmNetflixCharlize TheronfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Have our holiday wardrobes got a bit … overexcited?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I don’t want to be a killjoy. But there is a fine line between a cheerful holiday aesthetic and looking as though you bought the entire contents of your suitcase while on a sangria-fuelled shopping spree at Gatwick. Beguiling though all this stuff is, there is a point where tomato-print sundresses and sandals with ric-rac lacing stop looking delightfully Dolce, and start looking a tiny bit overwrought. Take a deep breath and put those fringed palazzo pants down.Think loose trousers or shorts, T-shirts or linen shirts, boat shoes or Birkenstocks. No perky sundresses or bedazzling sandalsThe holiday wardrobe is now as relentlessly marketed in summer as baubles at Christmas and roses on Valentine’s Day. The powers that be have figured out that “holiday” is a magic word when it comes to unlocking our purse strings. You can be sensible the rest of the year, but holidays are all about the treats, right?View image in fullscreenSlim linen waistcoat fromCosYes, you absolutely do deserve a treat. I’m on your side here, believe me. It is precisely because I am an absolute sucker for the chic Provençal promise of yet another straw basket that I am getting a bit fed up with how much the holiday glamour industrial complex takes out of my salary. So I’m trying to take the rosé-tinted sunglasses off and remember that living my best life is not actually the same thing as bankrupting myself on loads of gaudy tat.Also, the style tide is turning. I’ve been to a few fashion shows in the south of France and Italy in the past few months (I know, hard life), which provide excellent opportunities for close study of what fashiony people wear when it’s hot. And while long, dramatic dresses and slick tailoring are still pulled out of the bag for fancy evenings, the daytime and travelling looks are distinctly low-key. Think loose trousers or shorts, T-shirts or linen shirts, boat shoes or Birkenstocks. No perky sundresses, no bright co-ords, no bedazzling sandals.The name for this deliberately low-key look? Bore-core. But here’s the thing. In the sea of sunny pastels and jaunty polka dots that is the airside Pret queue, it is the traveller in sleek, muted neutrals who stands out. Of course, it has to be done well to work. Good quality fabric is key – but investing in quality linen or Supima cotton makes sense when the pieces you are buying will unpack straight from your holiday suitcase to your home wardrobe.To build this look, start with separates. You want soft tailoring, not athleisure. Look for shorts and trousers with belt loops – a belt adds sophistication without looking fussy – sleek tank tops as a bottom layer, and breezy collared shirts that can be buttoned up smartly or worn open as a beach cover-up. Keep everything in neutrals, but within that, tonal shades are good – not too matchy-matchy.View image in fullscreenM&Sgold sandalsBut we still want to feel special, right?

Here’s how to avoid disaster – and even enjoy yourselfZoe WilliamsWed 9 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTShareThe cliche about small talk is that everybody hates it. The misapprehension is that it has to be small. In fact, conversational interactions are objectively good. “The person who starts the conversation is in a better mood afterwards; they tend to feel more connected – and not just to the person they’re talking to,” says Gillian Sandstrom, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Sussex. “We all have a fundamental need to feel connected, valued and seen.” Even if small talk were not socially beneficial, society would demand it nonetheless – we are coming in to wedding season and we are all going to need some moves.However, we have this perception that there are rules, which haven’t really changed since the 50s: keep things light and relevant, avoid sex, religion and politics, stay on safe territory, such as the weather. But anodyne topics tend to be boring and difficult to segue out of.Journalists are always good at talking to strangers and distant acquaintances – not because we are nice, as I have just discovered, through the work ofPatrick King, the bestselling social interaction coach, but because conversation is infinitely easier when you have a “social purpose”, ie you need something: an opinion, an insight, a nugget of knowledge, 50p. So that is rule one: whatever you ask, imagine that you absolutely need to know the answer.Tom Bouchier Hayes, a broadcast journalist and a good friend, is famous for his small talk: he once met a guy in the sea and chatted for 40 minutes. He supplies rule two: “If you reveal something expected of yourself, people tend to reciprocate. You can up the ante quite quickly by saying something different.”Beyond that, there are no rules – it all depends on the situation.At a weddingMy uncle said once that he preferred funerals to weddings; I thought he was going to say something deep and melancholy about the evanescence of love and the finality of death, but he actually ended: “Just because I know more people.”Everyone dreads wedding small talk, because it tends to be insipid – on this happy day, of all days, no one wants to talk about things that matter – and the conversational drift is all towards matrimony (“When are you two going to get married?” “Are you married?”). These are dead ends, because no couple will tell you straight off the bat that they are unhappy and there is nothing more boring than a happy couple.View image in fullscreen‘Pick off one half of a couple.’Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images“I don’t tend to like talking to people in couples,” Bouchier Hayes says. “They’re often a bit cagey with what they reveal when their partner is listening. If they have a double act, it’s often a bit thin.” Pick off one half of a couple. Sandstrom says: “Small talk is building a bridge to get somewhere more interesting, so start with the thing you have in common, which will be the location or the event. At a wedding, my instinct is: ‘Bride or groom?’ and: ‘How do you know them?’” Trust that the conversation will pivot from “the groom is my cousin” to somewhere more interesting – “my other cousin is in prison, but that’s not the groom’s brother, he’s from a second aunt who fought in the French resistance”.“There is some research showing that, when people talk to strangers, they enjoy it more when they go a little deeper,” says Sandstrom. “We have this instinct that we should go bland and stick to the small talk, but that’s not what anybody wants; we all want something more meaningful.”Stuck in a lift with your bossYou have a huge amount in common – you work together – but you also have this giant power imbalance, which can be catastrophic for easy chat. Don’t gabble; don’t say something indiscreet in a panic; don’t raise something that should be said in a meeting. I would proffer some low-stakes but helpful intelligence: “Have you tried the new beetroot salad in the canteen? Well, you shouldn’t – it tastes of earth.”Bouchier Hayes can go one better (more awkward) than a lift. “I was changing in the loo, because I’d cycled in. It was very early. I’d taken my clothes off and one of the presenters came in while I was completely nude. He was a business reporter. I said: ‘How are the markets this morning, Charles?’”At a new sports clubView image in fullscreen‘Discuss which opponent to annihilate; the rest will take care of itself.’Photograph: Seiza Visuals/Getty ImagesYvalia Febrer, a professor of social work at Kingston University in south-west London, describes the concept of the common third, a shared activity that can be one of the fastest shortcuts to intimacy. Doing something together breaks down reserve, upends hierarchy and generates its own priorities, vocabulary and, over time, humour. The common third was devised as a model between social workers and hard-to-reach young people,but it applies equally to korfball, or similar. Discuss what to do next with the ball and which opponent to annihilate; the rest will take care of itself.On a first dateIt depends on what you want from the date; if it’s just a quick background check that they are not a weirdo and you are looking for something no-strings, you can flag that frankly. A conversation that starts: “This is just me checking that you’re lucid and reasonable in order that I may have sex with you inconsequentially,” will probably flow well.If you are looking for a more lasting relationship, take a look at the psychologist Arthur Aron’s36 questions. Don’tdothis conversation – it would sound forced to blurt out: “If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why?” Even though the list was designed not with romance in mind, but to create deeper conversations, it’s now so associated with falling in love that, if you bring it up, it will be you who doesn’t sound lucid or reasonable. But it’s an interesting template for generating openness, vulnerability and self-reflection, which is to say a person’s best self.View image in fullscreen‘It’s easier to stay open-minded with someone you don’t know.’Composite: Guardian Design; visualspace/Getty Images (posed by models)I’m going to risk being self-referential, because I think this is useful: I often interview the people for the Guardian featureDining across the divide, where people who hotly disagree meet to talk about their disagreement. It’s striking how many of them say some variation of: “It was much more like a date than [the other Guardian series]Blind date.” Politics is good. Disagreeing is good. “As long as you’re respectful and open about it,” Sandstrom says. “But people are when they’re talking to a stranger. If you’re talking to someone you’re really close to and they disagree on something fundamental, it feels really threatening. It’s easier to stay open-minded with someone you don’t know.”At the school gatesThe particular difficulties of school-gate chat are: first, that people aren’t interesting when they are talking about their children; and second, that people’s insecurities are foregrounded by the environment. Maybe your kid is truly behaving badly (not mine – they never did); maybe you feel judged by the other parents; maybe you are in trouble with a teacher for forgetting something critical, which is an unpleasant and unfamiliar experience for an adult to have. I found my school-gate tribe by ceaselessly slagging off other, more judgmental mothers. I made some incredibly precious friends, way later in life than I expected (and when I wasn’t looking for any). Some other people really hated me, but that is fine, too.Going to a party aloneThis is a lot of people’s worst nightmare, particularly if everyone else seems to know one another and people are moving in gaggles. Sandstrom says: “I ran a workshop last week on how to have a conversation and one person came up with their own solution, which was to say something like: ‘Hey, you guys seem like you’re having a good time; can I join you?’” This is a tricky manoeuvre, because you can’t go for the obvious – how do you know the host? You would be dragging the group back to base camp. Better to listen until the conversation suggests a question, then ask a follow-up – research shows thatpeople like you morewhen you ask follow-up questions, because it shows you were listening.View image in fullscreen‘You need to take a good time with you.’Photograph: Nicoleta Ionescu/Getty ImagesIf their conversation is flagging, you can take the reins, but “one anecdote is the right amount of anecdotes”, says Bouchier Hayes. “I’ve told my Diana [Princess of Wales] anecdote maybe a thousand times; it can be short, medium or long, depending on the audience.” (Here is the micro version: it was 1990, he was filming something in Kensington Palace, she was unhappily married to Prince Charles and she asked him out. Helovesthat story.)NetworkingA corporate scene needs a corporate answer. King’sBetter Small Talkis good on how to build social purpose across a range of business gatherings. If it’s a conference, ask someone what they thought of the keynote, but not too open-endedly – choose a specific point in the talk. (This may involve listening to the keynote.) If it’s a buffet, ask someone where the forks are. Asking for help, even on the most trivial matter, signals humility and cooperation, which are qualities that get squashed in a professional environment.When you are the plus-oneThere are so many possible scenarios. If it’s social and formal, see “At a wedding”, above. The most important thing is that you don’t hang on your partner’s arm and cramp his or her style – you need to take a good time with you. You won’t have a very interesting answer to: “How do you know the birthday boy?” so it’s better to ask the first question yourself.If it’s social and informal, talk about whatever you like – except,whatever you do, don’t try to interrogate your partner’s friends on his or her previous relationships. If the gang is stiff and the conversation runs dry, tell them Diana asked you out.If you are roaming about chatting unattended, could people think you are flirting with them? Sandstrom says not. “When people are in an environment where flirting is a normal thing to do, like in a speed-dating event, they are still not great at recognising what flirting looks like. But outside those situations, that’s just not where people’s minds tend to go.”If it’s a work event, it’s fine – possibly better – to stick close to your partner; if they are junior, they will have all manner of coping bolt-ons to their personality that you may not know about; you want to avoid accidentally unmasking them as, say,notan Arsenal fan. If they are senior, they don’t need you making a rebellious sub‑group with other plus-ones, or disclosing five things in a minute that they have never told anyone in 15 years. On a work away day with my first husband, I learned the international hand signal for “dial it down”.On public transportOK, I can tell you what not to do. I sat next to a woman on a train who was readingBarbara Kingsolver’s Demon Copperheadand I said: “God, isn’t it brilliant?” But she was reading it on her phone and millennials hateit when you look at their phones. So she said: “I’ve only just started it,” in a “move along, boomer” tone, then went to WhatsApp, to tell her friend what this incredibly intrusive train‑neighbour had just done, stopping in the middle of the message to check that I wasn’t also reading that, exceptI was.Sandstrom talks on the tube all the time. Because there are so many external stimuli – the noise, the other people – a one‑to-one conversation creates a cocoon, which intensifies focus. People tend not to initiate on public transport because they fear rejection, but that is rarer than you may think. Sandstrom studied 200 people having conversations every day for a week across various environments and found that people were rejected only 13% of the time.At a funeralThe topic is easy – you talk about the dead person – but the age span of mourners is always huge. Don’t be deterred. Sandstrom says: “I did a study of cross‑generational conversations – one group of 25- to 30-year-olds, one of 65- to 70-year-olds, talking within their groups and across them. As with all the studies that I’ve done, people ended up enjoying their conversations far more than they expected to. They felt they learned more or were exposed to a different perspective more when they had cross-generational conversations.“I think we give people more benefit of the doubt when they’re different to us. And we’re not that different. Everybody just wants to figure out how to live and be happy.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They’re wonderfully fragrant, and yield the essence of the broad bean’s familiar flavour without having to use the bean itself.Bean pod soup with herbsThis vibrant green soup is a quick, thrifty and deeply nourishing way to use an otherwise unwanted and unused ingredient. The pods offer a surprising depth of flavour, meaning you can reserve the beans themselves for another meal. You can also use finely minced broad bean pods in stews, risottos and sauces, both for a hidden boost of fibre and for that beloved and familiar green flavour.I often skip the traditional saute stage of soup- or stew-making, not just to save time and oil, but to keep the flavour (and colour) more vivid and fresh. As a busy dad of two, my approach to food is all about cooking slow food fast, simplifying recipes and creating shortcuts wherever possible, while still preparing whole foods from scratch.This soup is ready in just 10-12 minutes, from chopping board to bowl. The bean pods save waste, the white beans add body and protein, and the yoghurt and raw extra-virgin olive oil help create a rich, balanced soup packed with fibre, polyphenols and bright flavours.Serves2, generously150g broad bean pods(about five), beans saved for another use1 white onion, peeled and roughly sliced2-3 garlic cloves, unpeeled400g tin white beans, including their liquid20-40g herbs(mint, coriander, parsley), roughly chopped, including the stalks, plus a little extra to garnishJuice of½ lemon, plus the grated zest if it’s organic and unwaxed150gyoghurt, soya, goat’s or cow’s milk, or soft goat’s cheeseExtra-virgin olive oil, to serveStrip the stringy fibres from the sides of the empty broad bean pods by snapping the top and pulling down the length of each side of the pod. Chop the pods into roughly 5mm-wide pieces (this helps the fibrous skins blend to a puree) and place them in a saucepan with the onion, garlic, white beans and their liquid, and enough boiling water almost to cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for eight minutes.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Stir in the chopped soft herbs, Add the lemon juice (and grated zest, if using), and the yoghurt or soft goat’s cheese, and leave to cool (you don’t want the liquid to be hot when you blend it). Tip the lot into a high-speed jug blender, then blitz until completely smooth; check the soup for consistency, especially if using a lower-powered blender, and if need be strain it through a fine sieve, return it to a clean pan and reheat gently.Season to taste, ladle into bowls and serve hot topped with a swirl of extra yoghurt or cheese, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and the reserved chopped herbs.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteVegetablesSoupSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I use a 16cm-square baking tin.Prep5 minCook45 minMakes6-8 bars175g jumbo rolled oats125g dried apricots, roughly chopped50g pistachios1tbsp pumpkin seeds1tbsp sunflower seeds1tbsp sesame seeds1tbsp milled flax seeds1tsp ground cinnamonSalt75g coconut oil, or butter65g soft dark brown sugar60g tahini3tbsp honey, or maple syrup1 ripe banana, peeled and mashed1tsp vanilla extractHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line a small baking tin with greaseproof paper. Mix the oats, apricots, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, cinnamon and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a large bowl.Melt the coconut oil in a small saucepan on a low heat, then stir in the brown sugar until that, too, melts. Take off the heat and stir in the tahini, honey, mashed banana and vanilla, then stir the warm ingredients into the dry ingredients until well combined.Press the oat mixture into the lined tin, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Remove and leave to cool completely before slicing into bars.Aubergine and barberry kukuView image in fullscreenThis uses aubergine, but courgette can easily be subbed in instead. It’s packed with the classic Iranian ingredients of saffron, turmeric and barberries – small, sharp, dried berries that add a wonderful tang; source them in larger supermarkets, Middle Eastern grocers or online. Kukus can be eaten with a salad, as part of a picnic or meze, or stuffed into pockets of pitta for a snack.Prep10 minCook50 minServes43 medium aubergines, peeled and cut into 3cm piecesVegetable oilSalt1 pinch saffron strands1 pinch sugar1 medium onion, peeled and chopped1 fat garlic clove, peeled and crushed6 large eggs½tsp ground turmeric½tsp ground cumin1tbsp plain flour1tsp lemon juice2tbsp barberries1 large handful coriander leaves, finely choppedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Spread the aubergines on a large baking sheet, drizzle with three tablespoons of oil, sprinkle with a teaspoon of salt and toss to coat. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until completely soft, then remove and leave to cool.Meanwhile, grind the saffron and sugar in a mortar, add a tablespoon of just-boiled water and leave to steep for five minutes.Put two tablespoons of oil in a medium oven-safe pan on a medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for 15 minutes, or until soft and brown. Add the garlic, cook for two minutes more, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, saffron mixture, turmeric, cumin, flour, lemon juice and a half-teaspoon of salt, then fold in the barberries, coriander, roast aubergine pieces and fried onion.Pour two tablespoons of oil into the same pan on a medium heat. Tip in the kuku mixture, cover and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until just cooked through. You want it mostly set and puffing up a bit at the sides.Turn on the grill, then finish off the kuku under the grill until it is set and golden brown on top. Leave to cool to room temperature, then slice into thick triangles to serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Sabzi: Fresh Vegetarian Recipes for Every Day, by Yasmin Khan, published by Bloomsbury Publishing at £26.

Rivera could tell that one message, addressed “to Leila/Layla (the short girl with the red top)”, was almost certainly written by a man she encountered while watching the band Sweet Pill at Warped Tour’s Washington DC stop in June.“You tapped my shoulder and asked me to help you crowd surf,” the man wrote. “I picked you up, but no one around me wanted to help you crowd surf so I awkwardly had to put you back down. First, I’m sorry I couldn’t help more and second, I thought you were cute and even after I saw you later I was nervous to ask for your number or socials.”‘To the train lady with dark brown hair … ’: extraordinary stories of four couples who found love via small adsRead moreThe post’s writer shared his Instagram handle. Rivera, who is 29 and works in real estate, reached out. She told him that while she had a boyfriend, she found his message sweet, and she appreciated his help with her crowd surfing mission. The pair became friends over DM. They have plans to attend the same DC stint of Warped Tour together next year.“I would love to meet up and maybe try for him to catapult me up into the sky again,” Rivera said. “I do have a boyfriend, but I’m glad we can be friends.”Rivera, who straddles the gen Z-millennial cusp, did not grow up reading Craigslist’s missed connections. In those posts, people tried to reach strangers they shared fleeting moments with on the train or in line at the grocery store. Anyone who wouldn’t dare write their own came for the voyeuristic entertainment value, or maybe the secret hope that they were memorable enough to spark interest from a stranger.The posts were popular, little oddities reminding readers of the charmingly random nature of city living. In 2010, Craigslistestimatedthat there were nearly 8,000 new ads posted to New York City’s missed connections page a week.Craigslist’s missed connection posts live on. (Recently posted on New York’s page: “We met at a barbecue in Rockaway,” “We locked eyes for the longest time on 86th.”) But the rise of social media and dating apps certainly dulled its cultural influence. A decade later, young people eager to shoot their shot have revived the tradition on Reddit andTikTok.On Reddit, pages like r/warpedtour host missed connection “megathreads”, where commenters write about their own encounters and optimistically leave their contact information. Subreddits for cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Minneapolis and Richmond, Virginia, have joined in. Ditto for the music festivals Bonnaroo, Coachella and Electric Forest, as well as the Berlin techno club Berghain (where phones are all but verboten on the dancefloor, making for many missed connections).You move to a big city and are so filled with this hope for chance encounters and magical moments at every turnMaggie Hertz“I’m looking for the beautiful woman with amazing eyes [at] Popeyes,”wroteone Redditor in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Someone in Arlington, Virginia, issearchingfor the woman he met at a bar – while he was on a date with someone else. In St Louis, someone visiting their father in a hospital chemo ward saw a stranger crying in the hallway and stopped to pray with them; the stranger wasstillin their thoughts.Young people say that in romantic contexts the practice is an antidote todating fatigue, promising to fulfill that ultimate urban fantasy: locking eyes on a crowded subway platform and being so unforgettable that it compels a stranger to fall in love with you.It’s an analogue alternative todating apps, romanticized in older comedies such as Desperately Seeking Susan and Sleepless in Seattle.“You move to a big city and are so filled with this hope for chance encounters and magical moments at every turn,” said Maggie Hertz, a DJ at the New Jersey free-form radio station WFMU and host ofCat Bomb!,an all-cassette show that also plays missed connections from listeners who phone in. “There’s nothing more vulnerable than writing a missed connection.”Hertz said that none of the missed connections on her show have led to real-life meet-ups – at least that she knows about. That doesn’t take away from the fun.“My favorite came in at three in the morning,” Hertz said. “She sounded so excited and nervous and probably still drunk. She was at a diner in Brooklyn and there was a waiter there who she said looked like Jake Gyllenhaal. She was all gushy about him.”Last month, Karly Laliberte was exiting a Trader Joe’s in Boston’s Seaport neighborhood when she spotted a cute guy walking with his friends. “He was tall, which is a rarity in Boston,” said Laliberte, who is 30 and in sports marketing. “It’s a stereotype that’s sort of true: we call it ‘Short King City’.” In the movie version of their almost-encounter, she would cast Jacob Elordi. They walked in the same direction for a few blocks, and Laliberte could “feel his eyes” staring at her. She almost said hello, but stopped herself. She didn’t want to interrupt his conversation.There’s this desire to connect in-person. I’m craving a connection that’s organic and less forcedKarly LaliberteLaliberte got home and filmed a TikTok, pleading with viewers to help her identify this man, with only his height and a description of his outfit to go on. “Within hours, it had 50,000 views,” she said. “On TikTok, you can tag your city, so any video you post can be seen widely, locally. That made it seem like a logical place to post a missed connections. It felt a little vulnerable to put myself out there, but people did want to help.”Though she never found the man, Laliberte received messages from people offering Instagram handles of men they thought it could be. And they got pretty close – one was a man she already dated.Laliberte has spent years on dating apps, always orbiting the same group of people. She’s tired of swiping and wants an old-fashioned meet cute. “There’s this desire to connect in-person,” she said. “I’m craving a connection that’s organic and less forced.” Why not try to find the person who made eyes at you outside of a Trader Joe’s?While younger adults may be discovering missed connections, the practice predates even its Craigslist origins. Francesca Beauman – British historian and author of Shapely Ankle Preferr’d, a book about the history of lonely-hearts ads from 1695-2010 – has traced the first of its kind back to 1709.Published in the Tatler (now called Tatler), the ad said: “A gentleman who, on the 20th incident, had the honor to conduct a lady out of a boat at Whitehall Stairs, desires to know where he may wait for her.” The woman was instructed to contact a Mr Samuel Reeves. Beauman found a marriage record a year later under that same name. There’s no way to know if the union came out of that missed connection, but she hopes that’s the case.Three hundred years later, and there’s still little evidence the strategy works for finding true love. But people keep trying. Sometimes, there’s a glimmer of hope. The actor Colman Domingo recentlyrevealedthat he met his husband via a 2005 missed connections post. (They made serious eye contact at a Walgreens in Berkeley, California.) And while Laliberte didn’t find her tall guy, she said she would “100%” post another missed connection.“We’re all incurable romantics and enormously deluded,” Beauman said. “It’s fun to read them, just as much fun as it is to place or respond.”Explore more on these topicsDatingRelationshipsCraigslistRedditOnline datingTikTokSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.TheSony1000X series has long featured some of the best noise cancelling you can buy and has been locked in a battle with rival Bose for the top spot.The WH-1000XM6 replace the outgoing XM5 model and cost £399 (€449/$449/A$699) – far from cheap but not the most expensive among peers either.The outside design looks very similar to their predecessors, with smooth, soft-touch plastic bodies, plush earpads and headband, and a subtle Sony logo on the arms. The earcups now swivel and fold to allow the headphones to be more compact for travel in a redesigned hard fabric case with a magnetic clasp.View image in fullscreenThe case is excellent, closing with a satisfying snap, ready for travel.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe new headphones are light but feel solid and ready for the rigours of travel or a commute. They fit well, with enough pressure to keep them in place without any discomfort, though theBose QC Ultraare more comfortable. The earcups of the XM6 are slightly shallow compared with the Bose, which made getting a proper fit with glasses a little trickier.The right earcup has a responsive touch panel to handle playback and volume controls with swipes and taps, which works well unless you’re wearing gloves. The left earcup has a power button, a 3.5mm headphones socket and a button for toggling noise-cancelling modes.The XM6 can connect with two devices simultaneously through Bluetooth 5.3 and support the SBC, AAC and LDAC audio formats. They also supportBluetooth LE (LC3), the next generation of Bluetooth audio connectivity, which has yet to see widespread adoption but is good for future-proofing. Call quality is very good, sounding natural and full in either quiet or noisy environments, with the option of side tone, where you can hear yourself through the headphones.View image in fullscreenButtons for power and noise-cancelling modes are on the left ear cup, while the right ear cup controls playback and volume via a touch panel.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsWeight:254gDrivers:30mmConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C chargingBluetooth codecs:SBC, AAC, LDAC, LC3Rated battery life:30 hours ANC onThe headphones lasted slightly longer than their rated 30 hours in testing, managing more than 32 hours between charges using noise cancelling, which is very competitive and certainly long enough for a couple of weeks of commuting. They charge via USB-C in about 3.5 hours and can be used via Bluetooth or the headphones jack while being charged.Impressive noise cancellingInside the XM6 is the first chip upgrade in quite a few years. The new QN3 processor is seven times as fast as the previous model and supports 12 microphones for detecting unwanted noise, delivering some of the most impressive noise cancelling I’ve experienced in a long time.Most good noise-cancelling headphones handle the low rumbles of engines and other roar-type sounds well, but even the best struggle with higher pitch tones such as keyboard taps and background chatter. Here is where the XM6 have raised the bar, doing a better job than others of neutralising those annoying higher tones, so much so that train and bus announcements were almost inaudible, particularly when listening to music.They also have a very good, natural-sounding ambientmode allowing you to clearly hear the outside world. There are 20 different levels to choose from or a system to automatically adjust it depending on the background noise. It can also allow voices through while blocking other sounds.View image in fullscreenThe Sony Sound Connect app controls modes, adjust settings, has a full EQ and performs updates. It also enables location and activity-based modes.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe headphones produce the sort of rounded, well-controlled and detailed sound you should expect from a market leader. They deliver power and solid bass when needed, while preserving detail across the range with excellent separation of tones. They can be a little clinical in some tracks that require a more raw sound, such as Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit. They have a warm and slightly bass-accentuated profile out of the box that is a great listen, but a full equaliser allows you to adjust the sound to taste.The XM6 also support various sound modes, including a novel background music feature that makes it sound as if you’re in a cafe or living room, plus a cinema audio mode for movies. They can also be used withSony’s 360 Reality Audiosystem or Android’s built-in spatial audio system including head tracking with supported phones.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe black soft-touch plastic picks up fingerprints quite easily but is easy to polish.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe headphones are generally repairable and were praised for amore repairable designby the specialists iFixit. The earcups caneasily be removed. The headphones are made with recycled plastic.PriceThe Sony WH-1000XM6 cost£399(€449/$449.99/A$699.95). For comparison, theBose QuietComfort Ultracost£350, theSonos Acecost£449, theBeats Studio Procost£349.99, theSennheiser Momentum 4 Wirelesscost£199and theFairbuds XLcost£219.VerdictSony has set a new bar for noise cancelling with its sixth-generation 1000X series headphones. The WH-1000XM6 cut out more of the difficult higher-tone noise such as background chatter better than any other rivals.The rest is a refinement on previous models. Quality sound makes them a delight to listen to. They are light and comfortable to wear with good controls. Solid 32-plus-hour battery life, a folding design and an excellent case make them easy to live with.Bose still holds the comfort crown with the QC Ultra, Sony’s design is a bit boring and they certainly aren’t cheap at £400, even if some rivals cost a lot more. But if you want the best noise cancelling money can buy, the WH-1000XM6 are it.Pros:new best-in-class noise cancelling, great sound, spatial audio, light and comfortable, fold up for travel with great case, Bluetooth multipoint, Bluetooth LE/LC3 support, 32-hour battery life, good controls, good cross-platform control app, more repairable design.Cons:expensive, dull-looking, no water resistance, spatial audio limited with an iPhone.Explore more on these topicsHeadphonesSonyBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

These are some steps you can take:What to do if your house keys are lostHere’s what you can do if you find yourself in this situation:Retrace your steps and look in the places where you usually leave your keys. Start where you last remember having them and check where you have been since. If a passerby outdoors has found your keys, it’s possible they may have put them somewhere visible – on a wall or bench, for example.Check if you have left a spare key with a neighbour, family member or friend. Also, notify anyone you live with, such as a housemate or partner. This can help you get into your home, but does not remove any potential security risks.Report the missing keys to the police. Providing a clear description of what they and any keyrings look like will help the police get them back to you in the event that they are handed in.Post on your neighbourhood Facebook or WhatsApp group, or on an app such as Nextdoor, to see whether they have been picked up by someone. Do not include your address.If you think you probably lost your keys some way from your home, and there is no identifying information on them that could lead someone to the property, then some people would take the view that you don’t need to get your lock rekeyed or changed. (Rekeying is the process of changing the internal mechanism of a lock so old keys no longer work and a new set of keys can be used, and is generally cheaper than changing the whole lock.) But you may want to, just to be on the safe side.And if you have lost your only set of keys, you are going to need to call a locksmith. It is worth calling round a few firms to get quotes, and agree the price before the work is done. Emergency locksmiths are available 24/7 so can help even in the early hours of the morning. The price can vary depending on the time of day and the type of lock.If you are renting the property, you need to tell your landlord or housing association. They might be able to help with lock changes or provide a spare key in some cases.What to do when you get new keysOnce you have dealt with any immediate security concerns, there are a few more things you can do to prevent future problems:View image in fullscreenYou may wish to get the lock changed or rekeyed.Photograph: Ian Nolan/Getty Images/Image SourceGet a spare key (or two) cut in case you lose them again. It is not wise to keep it under the doormat or a flowerpot – leave it with someone nearby whom you trust.You may want to consider investing in a key safe or lockbox to securely store a spare key. If you don’t know anyone in your area, this is a safe alternative – as long as you remember the code, and to put the key back afterwards.Consider getting a smart lock if you are worried about losing your keys again. These allow you to unlock your door without a physical key using a code, card or app on your smartphone. Companies such as Yale sell various types, and tech websites such as TechRadarhavehave recommendations of which to buy. If you already have a smart lock, make sure you update the access code or deactivate any lost key cards.Think about buying a Bluetooth tracking device such as an Apple AirTag, a Tile Mate tracker or the Chipolo One tracke You can attach this to your keys (or a bag or purse). This can help locate them if they go missing again.Explore more on these topicsMoneyLost or stolenConsumer affairsGadgetsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nicole Kidman and Kyle MacLachlan nattering on the front row. And an appearance from Mrs Bezos herself.The stars were always going to align in Paris for Demna’s final show atBalenciaga. And on Wednesday lunchtime, the most controversial and copied designer in modern fashion bowed out after a decade with a show that conformed to the idea of couture as much as it challenged it.Backstage, Demna spoke with relief about “leaving this city that I love and hate for good” when he moves to his new job at Gucci in Milan next week. But before then, he wanted to “make couture relevant”.Democratising couture isn’t easy. This stuff is handmade to exacting rules and wildly expensive. But the plan was to use the show as a stage and the clothes as costumes for social commentary. Previous hot topics have included climate change, swag-wars and AI. On Wednesday it was a study of the relevant dress codes of “La Bourgeoisie” – and the moneyed few sat here who fork out for it.The stage itself was Cristóbal Balenciaga’s former apartment, restored to its plush 1960s cream glory when the Georgian designer introduced couture in 2021.At the glamorous end were a sugar pink debutante dress made from the world’s lightest organza, and a sequinned skirt suit based on – what else – Demna’s grandma’s kitchen tablecloth. No doubt Mrs Bezos had her eye on the elegant corset dresses which came without boning, “so you can actually breathe”, he said.Famous for flipping traditional notions of beauty by casting models of all ages and sizes, out came nine Neapolitan suits without shoulder pads and modelled by bodybuilders because “it isn’t the garment that defines the body, but the body that defines the garment”.View image in fullscreenDemna (second from left) in June at the Paris menswear spring/summer 2026 show with (from left) Guram Gvasalia, Tori Brixx and Rich the Kid.Photograph: Pierre Suu/Getty ImagesThere followed references from Demna’s greatest hits, including a seam-free puffer coat and couture trainers, while references from Cristobal’s came in the shapes and long sleeves; the show ended with a cream, bell-shaped Guipure lace gown which referenced the scale of Balenciaga’s from the 1950s.Few designers have had the cultural reach of Demna, who was made creative director at Balenciaga in 2016 after stints at Maison Margiela, Louis Vuitton and his own label, Vetements.During his career here, he has orchestrated frenzies around ordinary items such as Crocs and Ikea Frakta bags, upending the meaning of good taste while infuriating critics by whacking four-figure price tags on to distressed trainers.Intended as a joke and a commentary on the hierarchy of value, it proved a particularly lucrative gag for Balenciaga’s parent company, Kering, becoming a billion-dollar megabrand.For some, Demna never recovered from allegations that he had condoned child exploitation in a series of ads involving BDSM imagery and children in 2022. At the time, he took responsibility, although the scandal dented both hype and sales for some time.Ultimately, it predicated a move away from his more viral designs, which had begun to distract, and he became more focused on his skills as a designer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Demna’s back catalogue will continue to polarise, but his legacy is indisputable. As Demna said: “I’m so hard on myself – but I could not do better than this at Balenciaga.”Was this Giorgio Armani’s last ever collection? Last month, for the first time in the designer’s history, the designer missed his Milan shows due to to ill health.The plan had been a precautionary one, a rest before this show. So a no-show from the designer at his show at the company headquarters this week, coupled with visibly emotional models ambling like Erté sketches down the catwalk, certainly sent tongues wagging.In an attempt to stop the rumour mill, the 90-year-old designer explained his absence to a handful of reporters in an email: “Even though I wasn’t inParis, I oversaw every aspect of the show remotely via video link, from the fittings to the sequence and the makeup”. His absence, he said, was at the behest of his of his doctors: “Although I felt ready to travel, they recommended extending my rest.”Regardless of whether you could afford an Armani suit, one of his legacies has been encouraging women to wear trouser suits. And at the show, among the sculptural peplums and slithery gowns with oversized bows, came tuxedos in funereal black. Ostensibly glamorous versions of the menswear he began in the 1980s, there was also a finality to them.Keen to control the narrative of his £10bn Armani empire, of which he is a sole shareholder, he was quick to remind us that “everything [we saw] … has been done under my direction and carries my approval”.Explore more on these topicsBalenciagaParisFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Where is the finest mountain panorama in the UK? As a nine-year-old I was taken up Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) and told it was the best. Even in those days, it was a struggle to see much except the backs of other people. The following summer Scafell Pike got the same treatment and the next year we climbed Ben Nevis. I disagreed on all counts. For me, Thorpe Cloud in Dovedale was unbeatable, despite it being under a thousand feet tall. What convinced me was the diminutive Derbyshire peak’s shape: a proper pointy summit with clear space all around, plus grassy slopes that you could roll down. The champion trio could not compare.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This panorama question is in my mind as I begin hiking up Slieve Donard, Northern Ireland’s highest peak (at 850 metres), but a mountain often forgotten by those listing their UK hiking achievements. And a proper peak it is too, with a great sweeping drop to the sea and loads of space all around, guaranteeing, I reckon, a view to beat its more famous rivals.Mourne Mountain views mapSlieve Donard’s relative obscurity outside of Northern Ireland is not difficult to understand. During the Troubles, visitor numbers plummeted and many locals gave up country walks. “We never went to the mountains,” one tells me, from Belfast, which is only an hour away to the north. “A road sign replaced with a sniper image is not very welcoming.”Since that tragic period, the Mourne Mountains have made a terrific comeback, appearing in several episodes as parts of Westeros (along with other locations in Northern Ireland) in theGame of ThronesTV series.View image in fullscreenThe 20-mile Mourne Wall was built in the early 20th century to keep sheep away from reservoirs supplying Belfast.Photograph: Matjaz Corel/AlamyI set off from the eastern side, at a spot called Bloody Bridge – named after a massacre in the 1641 rebellion – where there are crystal clear pools in the river before it tumbles into the sea. The path steadily racks up, passing through a quarry then reaching a saddle at over 500m, where a massive stone wall heads directly up the mountain. This is theMourne Wall, a 22-mile miracle of human labour, crossing a total of 15 peaks in the range. It was constructed between 1904 and 1922 to keep sheep out of the central Mournes, where several important reservoirs supplying Belfast were located. Now it’s the site of an annual race and a handy landmark on misty days. It’s also a stiff climb. I deliberately avoid checking the view: it’s going to be magnificent.Where else can you start by the sea, climb the highest peak, and finish four or five hours later with a sea dip?The maximum distance you can see from any peak can be roughly calculated by multiplying the square root of the height in metres by 3.57. That, however, is not necessarily the final answer. Distant peaks beyond the horizon will poke their tops up and variability in light refraction around the Earth means the maximum distance can sometimes be extended significantly. The official record for a ground-to-ground distance view is 300 miles, between two Argentinian mountains in 2023. My own record was a glimpse of Monte Cinto in Corsica from the Alpes-Maritimes, around 155 miles away.I pause on the climb, puffing a bit, and bang the numbers into my phone’s calculator. At 850m, Slieve Donard’s potential view distance is around 65 miles, which should mean that most elements of the British Isles are visible on a blue-sky day like this one.I reach the summit and climb over the Mourne Wall to stand next to the bronze age cairn. I look east. Nothing. No Scafell Pike or Yr Wyddfa, not one bit of Scotland, or the Isle of Man either. Sea haze, the curse of the hiker who didn’t get up early, is the problem, particularly frustrating on an otherwise clear day. Having said that, it is a fabulous summit, perched high above the rest of the Mournes, with superb views south and west over the whole of County Down and on into the Republic of Ireland.I come down via the Glen River, another sparkling stream that leads me right back into the town of Newcastle, where I go directly to the beach and dive in. The view might have failed, but where else can you start by the sea, climb the highest peak, and finish four or five hours later with a sea dip?View image in fullscreenSlieve Donard and Newcastle from Murlough Beach.Photograph: Wirestock/AlamyA quick change and I head for thePercy French Restaurantin theSlieve Donard Hotel. The front door, I’m told, has a Game of Thrones connection, but it’s really Percy French that intrigues me. An Irish songwriter and wit, French was one of those characters that light up their age. A contemporary of Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats, he regularly performed in Newcastle in the late 19th century and wrote the song The Mountains o’ Mourne,but never achieved much fame outside Ireland. There’s a bronze bust of the man on a side table, and I resolve to take one of his comic couplets as my motto in the quest for the finest panorama. “I’m not as bold as lions but I’m braver than a hen/And he that fights and runs away will live to fight again.”Next day my goal isSlieve Binnian, at 747m the third highest peak in the range, and arguably the most beautiful. It’s another blue sky, so I am hopeful for fine views.I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains that made me feel that a giant might raise his head over the next ridgeCS LewisThe track to the summit follows the Mourne Wall the entire distance (about two miles) and at the top I see why locals favour this peak: the summit and ridge are lined with stunning towers of granite, the Back Castles. I scramble up to the highest point. Sea haze. Loads of the stuff, a thick purple porridge all across the eastern horizon. Slieve Donard to the north-east is impressive and the panorama of the MourneMountainscould not be bettered, but I’ve missed that 360 once again.View image in fullscreenKevin Rushby on one of the Back Castles of Slieve Binnian.Photograph: Kevin RushbyI head down the coast to the town of Rostrevor, a place whose dramatic setting inspired the writer CS Lewis to dream up the world of Narnia. “I have seen landscapes,” he wrote, “notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge.” In theKilbroney Park, next to the town, there’s a good cafe,Synge and Byrne, and a Narnia trail. The town itself boasts a fine high street and some stalwart traditional pubs, one of which I choose for a post-panoramic failure pint.I ask the barman if the undertaker’s business next door is part of the pub. “It used to make the wakes easy to organise,” he laughs. “But it’s closed down now. Mind you, we kept plenty of ghosts. There’s one who throws things, but is rarely seen.” Like England, Scotland and Wales, I reflect.Next day is my last chance. The neighbour to my cottage advises on trying Knockchree, a hill of Thorpe Cloud dimensions at 306m. “It stands a bit separate and that makes for a lovely view.” Exactly what my nine-year-old self understood. But my calculator says capable of only a 37-mile range.Cuckoos and stonechats are calling as I make the climb through pine plantation then up heathland. At the summit I sit down. A magnificent panorama of fields and Mourne Mountains is spread all before me in vivid colour and the sea horizon is perfectly clear. I think I can make out the summit of Snaefell on the Isle of Man, a full 60 miles away, which is a triumph, but England, Scotland and Wales have certainly ceased to exist. There are, however, two ancient kingdoms within my grasp: Westeros and Narnia, and they will do.Accommodation was provided bySykes Holiday Cottages, which has various properties in theMournesarea, includingCarol Cottage, which sleeps up toeight, from £727 for three nights.Stena Lineferries sail to Belfasttwicedaily from Liverpool andsixtimes daily fromCairnryan(near Stranraer).

If my living room was filled with judgmental spirits, it felt disrespectful to remain such a messBryan SafiWed 9 Jul 2025 01.55 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 13.28 EDTShareAbout a year after I moved into my apartment in Los Angeles, I was woken up by three loud knocks on my bedroom door at 3am. I thought there might be an intruder – but I got up, opened the door, and there was nobody there. I went to the front door, thinking I had misheard it, but there was nobody there either. I thought I had imagined it. Then it kept happening about once a week.I thought it must be my upstairs neighbours, perhaps working a night shift, but after I introduced myself to them to ask about the noise, they assured me they wouldn’t be awake at that hour. I asked the man who looks after our 70s-built apartment block if there were problems with the pipes. He said no. At one point, I started putting my dresser in front of the door, because I was so scared. I couldn’t shake the idea that somebody was getting into my apartment, even though there was no evidence of it. I didn’t tell anyone for ages – because if I had, I would have had to recognise how crazy I sounded.View image in fullscreenBryan’s pre-ghost look.Photograph: Courtesy of Bryan SafiFinally, I mentioned it to a close friend. I thought she would laugh at me, but she became very serious – it was, she said, a ghost. Worse – it was probably a demon. “Two knocks is a ghost, three knocks is a demon,” she told me, adding that I shouldn’t speak to it or acknowledge its presence because “it will just get bolder”. I didn’t believe in any of it, so I confided in another friend, hoping for a different reaction. She decided to buy me a session with a ghost hunter who claimed to “clear” such presences.I thought the ghost hunter would come to my apartment, or at least arrange a phone or video call, but she just sent me an email saying she’d done whatever she needed to do, remotely. She had encouraged some spirits to leave, she said, but there were others – five, she thought – who wouldn’t go until they’d held what she called a “court of atonement”. They would be on trial in my home.View image in fullscreenPost-ghost Bryan.Photograph: Courtesy of Bryan SafiThe ghostbuster said the trial was being held in my living room. When I moved into the apartment in 2019, my interior designer friend styled this room for me. I wanted a space I felt really great about, and it was beautiful, but I ended up feeling that it was too nice for me to spend time in. Other than the few times I had people over, I barely stepped into my living room, so it didn’t surprise me when she said the trial was happening in there, because it never really felt like mine.I have always been an extreme people pleaser, and although I still didn’t genuinely believe five ghosts would be holding a trial in my apartment, I started to feel uncomfortable about them being there and judgingme. They were, I assumed, old or from a different era, and it felt almost disrespectful to keep living as I was. So I started keeping my apartment cleaner and tidier, and stopped leaving drink cans around. I’d had a painful relationship breakup not long before, and had been having lots of hook-ups, but that stopped once I was aware of the ghost trial – or I stopped hosting them, at least. I stopped ordering fast food in the middle of the night and started eating better. I took up meditation, making my bed, and not hitting the snooze button. I wasn’t dressing for the formality of a courtroom, but I did start to take more care of my appearance. I didn’t believe that the ghosts were real – but if they were, I didn’t want to live badly in front of them.View image in fullscreenThe living room Bryan felt he didn’t deserve.Photograph: Courtesy of Bryan SafiSoon, I noticed I was happier and more confident. The feelings of anxiety and guilt that I’d carried around all my life were becoming easier to manage. It was a ridiculous situation, but dealing with a ghost trial somehow made me feel as if I could deal with anything. I had grown up in a religious family, and embraced science and reason as an adult, but the experience made me more open-minded about things that couldn’t be explained.I don’t know if the trial reached a verdict – it might still be happening – but, last spring, it finally felt as if the spirits left for good. The changes I made to my life, however, have largely remained, and I feel more content than ever. Buying the apartment had felt like an achievement – I had been saving for it for more than a decade – but also like something I didn’t really deserve. I’m a catastrophiser and it always seemed as if everything could just be taken away at any moment. Now, I feel weirdly bonded to my home, like we went through this together. Slowly, I’ve become more optimistic; I’ve realised it’s not a sin to enjoy something. And, thankfully, the knocking has stopped.As told to Emine SanerBryan Safi: Are You Mad At Me??is at Underbelly, Bristo Square: Friesian, Edinburgh, 30 July-25 AugustExplore more on these topicsLife and styleA moment that changed meHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If Adam Dorr is correct, robots and artificial intelligence will dominate the global economy within a generation and put virtually the entire human race out of a job. The social scientist doubles up as a futurist and has a stark vision of the scale, speed and unstoppability of a technological transformation that he says will replace virtually all human labour within 20 years.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Dorr heads a team of researchers who have studied patterns of technological change over millennia and concluded that the current wave will not just convulse but obliterate the labour market by 2045. What cars did to horses and carts, and electricity to gas lamps, and digital cameras to Kodak, are templates for the coming shock, he says. “Technology has a new target in its crosshairs – and that’s us. That’s our labour.”Whatever you do in whatever sector, within a generation machines will be able to perform the same task just as well, if not better, and for a fraction of the cost, says Dorr. “Costs are improving consistently, capabilities are improving consistently. We’ve seen that pattern before. If I can get the same thing or better for the same or lower cost, switching is a no-brainer. We’re the horses, we’re the film cameras.”View image in fullscreenAdam Dorr: ‘We’re the horses, we’re the film cameras.’Photograph: Andrew Watchorn PhotographyDorr, 48, is a technology theorist with a PhD in public affairs from the University of California, Los Angeles, and is the director of research atRethinkX, a US-registered nonprofit that analyses and forecasts technological disruption. It was founded and is largely funded by James Arbib and Tony Seba, technology entrepreneurs and investors.Dorr spoke to the Guardian on a visit to Ireland, where he addressed theDargan Forum, a two-day gathering in Dún Laoghaire, south Dublin, that focused on green and digital transitions.Dorr combined an ominous prediction – humanoid robots powered by increasingly capable artificial intelligence will spread across virtually every industry, leaving humans unable to compete – with a jarring blast of optimism: handled well, this revolution will usher in “super-abundance” that will liberate humanity. But handled badly, new extremes of inequality and oligarchy beckon.The transition will be faster than most people think, says Dorr. “We’ve documented 1,500-plus technological transformations across all of human history. Through the theoretical lens that we’ve developed, a consistent set of patterns emerge over and over and over again.”Once a new technology captures just a few percentage points of “mind share or market share”, it tends to acquire overwhelming dominance within 15 to 20 years, which according to Dorr, means robots and AI will soon make human labour all but obsolete.“Machines that can think are here, and their capabilities are expanding day by day with no end in sight. We don’t have that long to get ready for this. We know it’s going to be tumultuous.”Some sectors will have an interregnum during which humans can work effectively alongside robots – just like the period when chess grandmasters teamed up with chess programs – but sooner rather than later humans will just be in the way, says Dorr.Jobs whose value depend on human input – such as sports coaches, politicians, sex workers, ethicists – will endure but even they will face competition from machines. “There will remain a niche for human labour in some domains. The problem is that there are nowhere near enough of those occupations to employ 4 billion people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We don’t even know if we have the right questions. We need to experiment now and try out new ownership structures, new stakeholder structures.”View image in fullscreenAdam Dorr at the Royal Marine hotel in Dún Laoghaire, Dublin.Photograph: Andrew Watchorn PhotographyHe has written a book,Brighter: Optimism, Progress and the Future of Environmentalism, that is a paean to clean energy and hope. He acknowledges the perils of economic dislocation, populist backlash and misinformation but says that is not inevitable. Gains in productivity and abundance will be vast and distribution – for instance, by emulating the example open source software – could be fair. “This could be one of the most amazing things to ever happen to humanity.”Previous futurists have predicted eras of leisure and been spectacularly wrong but Dorr says this time it really will happen and the tiny portion of society who in the past did not need to work, such as aristocrats, will offer guidance on how to fill the time.“We can think of examples of spoiled rich brats who seemed sort of aimless and perhaps miserable but others were able to live meaningful, purposeful lives. I think we will find meaning in our relationships with our friends and family and our connections to our communities.

Yet the project had been plagued with issues and delays, and last week officials confirmed that after only 15 months in orbit the satellite had lost contact with the ground and was likely unrecoverable.Satellite to ‘name and shame’ worst oil and gas methane pollutersRead moreThe loss of the satellite dealt a heavy blow to the country’s fledgling government-funded space sector. New Zealand initially invested NZ$29m in MethaneSat, a project led by the US non-profit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) with other finance coming from the Bezos Earth Fund, the Audacious Project and the Valhalla Foundation.The satellite’s primary goal was to detect methane leaks from oil and gas production worldwide. But in New Zealand, Mikaloff-Fletcher leads a complementary project to explore if the satellite could also track the release of the potent greenhouse gas from agriculture. Methane from livestock accounts for almost half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions.The project was years in the making and some experts have criticised New Zealand’s involvement. In 2019, the government agreed to invest in the mission but the satellite’s launch was delayed untilMarch 2024.Almost NZ$12m of the funding was used to build a mission control centre at Rocket Lab, a private space company with a launchpad on the remote east coast of New Zealand and also operating from the US.The University of Auckland was to take over mission control last year but problems led to further delays. They included the satellite going into safe mode due to intense solar activity, and issues with operating its thrusters. The university never took control because the satellite stopped responding on 20 June. By this point New Zealand’s total investment had risen to NZ$32m, according to the New ZealandSpaceAgency, because of additional funding allocated to maintain capability to take over operations.Judith Collins, minister for space in the New Zealand government, declined to comment on the loss of MethaneSat. The deputy head of the New ZealandSpaceAgency, Andrew Johnson, described it as “clearly a disappointing development”.But Johnson says involvement in the mission has strengthened New Zealand’s expertise and space capability, and the mission control centre at the University of Auckland’s Te Pūnaha Ātea Space Institute will continue to be used as a training facility to position the country for future missions.However, Richard Easther, a University of Auckland physicist who is not involved in the project, says it was a mistake for New Zealand to invest in MethaneSat. He was initially excited about the mission, but says it’s become “clear they haven’t been able to keep to schedule and deliver a functional spacecraft”.While the mission was deploying new methane-detecting sensors, the design of the spacecraft itself was not as well defined as it should have been when New Zealand invested in it and parts of it “haven’t been tested in space”.View image in fullscreenThe MethaneSat under construction.Photograph: 2024 Ball Aerospace/BAE SystemsMethaneSat’s mission lead and chief scientist for EDF Steve Hamburg says the mission was “technologically ambitious” and the team that developed the satellite “includes some of the world’s most seasoned professionals in both public and private sector space flight”.Johnson says the providers of the satellite’s structural and functional components, as well as the sensor, were selected before New Zealand joined the mission, but given the expertise of the professionals involved, “we had no reason to doubt their judgement.”Jon Coifman, a spokesperson for MethaneSat, says it was unclear what caused the loss of contact, but an expert panel had been set up to investigate. The existing datasets would remain accessible “for the foreseeable future” and more data would be released over the next few months. The team remains “undeterred in our efforts to drive down methane pollution”.“No other satellite could match the ability to detect changes in methane levels with such high resolution and high sensitivity over such wide areas,” Coifman says.Mikaloff-Fletcher says there have been other missions that have facedsimilar challenges.“A great example is Nasa’s Orbital Carbon Observatory mission, meant to deliver the most precise measurements of carbon dioxide ever made from space. It was launched in 2009 and fell into the ocean without making a single measurement,” Mikaloff-Fletcher says, though she notes further satellites were launched to achieve the mission.She says MethaneSat did record data that will be useful in tracking agricultural emissions, and her work in the field will continue despite the setback.Preliminary analysis shows the satellite’s observations over agricultural targets in New Zealand line up well with modelling and measurements collected by aircraft-borne instruments, suggesting “we will be able to quantify agricultural emissions in a wide range of different farming systems from existing data”.“The satellite’s life may be shorter than hoped, but the project will go on to shed new light on agricultural emissions from the data we have.”Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandSpaceAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But while it casts artificial intelligence as a threat to young talent, it misses a deeper truth: AI isn’t just disrupting the job market, it’s reshaping it entirely.Unfortunately, the decline in entry-level roles is not a temporary glitch. AI already outperforms most graduate hires in tasks such as summarising, analysing and content creation. As the technology evolves, it will continue to replace higher-skilled mid-level and expert roles in fields such as law, finance, marketing and journalism.AI is cheaper, faster and more scalable than most graduate employees. For-profit companies have little incentive to choose graduates over AI systems unless regulation compels them.None of this means young people are obsolete. But it does mean we need to reimagine the future.Universal basic income, once seen as radical, is becoming a practical response to a world with fewer jobs, where opportunity must be decoupled from employment.The real risk isn’t automation. It’s inertia. As technology develops at an unprecedented pace, clinging to outdated employment models will only deepen socioeconomic inequality and we will fail the next generation.AI has the potential to liberate us from repetitive labour. But to ensure it benefits everyone we must act now, not just to protect jobs but to redefine what it means to live, contribute and thrive in an age of intelligent machines.Ben WoodfordEmployment support specialist, CardiffAs someone working in the service sector and attempting to retrain using AI tools myself, I see both the promise and peril of this rapid technological shift. The potential of AI to revolutionise industries is undeniable. But the cost must not be borne by a generation already scarred by a pandemic-disrupted education, crushing student debt and, now, shrinking pathways into meaningful careers.Graduates are not just entry-level labourers – they are future innovators, leaders and entrepreneurs. Denying them the chance to learn, grow and gain experience because a machine can draft a memo faster is shortsighted. A generation raised on digital fluency is uniquely placed to enhance, not be replaced by, emerging technologies.We need urgent action, not just rhetoric. That means government incentives for companies to hire and train graduates. It means AI integration that supports rather than supplants human development. It means rethinking what “entry-level” work should look like in the 2020s and ensuring mentorship, creativity and real responsibility remain part of it.Clare ColeyTunstall, StaffordshireI am 77 and a retired engineer. I have been using and creating AI GPTs (generative pre-trained transformers) for more than two years. It is a revolution in collaborative thinking and problem solving. Graduates must learn to use it to solve business problems in everything they do. They must learn to use and create their own GPTs to increase productivity and lower costs. Productivity depends on continuously improving processes. AI does this. Learn it. Use it.

Two stand out.The first is that the world needs more energy. Poor countries certainly do. But the clean-energy transition involves shifting to much more efficient technologies, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps. Many studies, includingby the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, show that these can enable rich countries to halve their energy use while improving living standards. The whole world could have western European lifestyles and still use less energy.The second error is to argue that wind and solar energy cannot power a reliable electricity grid. A majorstudy by the Royal Societyshowed that a system based on these resources with some long-duration storage is not only feasible, but will be cheaper than a system with any level of nuclear power. Nuclear power is a costly distraction from building an efficient and renewable system.Nick EyreEmeritus professor of energy and climate policy, University of OxfordYour author, in his enthusiasm to highlight the cheaper costs to build new nuclear plants, failed to include the ever-increasing costs of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their working life. This must be included in any comparison of costs.He also failed to mention the problems of vast amounts of highly dangerous radioactive nuclear waste and accidents, freak weather – such as the tsunamis causing radioactive leaks in Japan – and potential terrorist attacks.Nuclear may not cause atmospheric carbon waste but it does create hugely toxic radioactive waste that remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years. A problem that threatens the health of all life.He mentions thatFinlandhas made a deep burial site for nuclear waste, and the probability of geological activity and disturbance has obviously been factored in. However this does not mean it is guaranteed to stand the tests of time – and stable rock formations found at the site in Finland may not be so readily found elsewhere.Kathleen AskewHayling Island, HampshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Where were you educated?”Boakai seemed to chuckle. English is the official language of Liberia.“In Liberia?” Trump asked. “Yes sir,” Boakai said.“That’s very interesting, that’s beautiful English” Trump said. “I have people at this table who can’t speak nearly as well.”‘Delay is catastrophic’: how simple solutions could save thousands of African children in comasRead moreLiberia was founded in 1822 as a colony for free Black Americans, the brainchild of white Americans trying to address what they saw as a problem – the future for Black people in the US once slavery ended. English is Liberia’s official language, though multiple Indigenous languages are spoken there as well.Trump hosted the leaders from Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania and Senegal at the White House on Wednesday, telling them that he was shifting the US approach to the continent from aid to trade and that the US is a better partner forAfricathan China. Many of the leaders at the meeting spoke in their own languages through interpreters.Trump said his administration was committed to strengthening friendships in Africa, which he hoped to visit at some point.“We’re shifting from aid to trade,” he said at the start of a White House meeting. “There’s great economic potential in Africa, like few other places. In many ways, in the long run, this will be far more effective and sustainable and beneficial than anything else that we can be doing together.”The African leaders, in turn, heaped praise on the US president for brokering peace deals around the world and expressed support for his receiving a Nobel Prize.“We are not poor countries. We are rich countries when it comes to raw materials. But we need partners to support us and help us develop those resources,” said Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema, president of Gabon. “You are welcome to come and invest. Otherwise, other countries might come instead of you.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpAfricaLiberiaEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

Her six novels and two short story collections include The Translator, Elsewhere, Home and, most recently, 2023’s River Spirit.“This comes as a complete and utter surprise,” said the writer on hearing the news. “For someone like me, a Muslim Sudanese immigrant who writes from a religious perspective probing the limits of secular tolerance, this recognition feels truly significant. It brings expansion and depth to the meaning of freedom of expression and whose stories get heard.”Aboulela was announced winner at English PEN’s summer party on Wednesday evening, where actors Khalid Abdalla and Amira Ghazalla read from her work. She will receive the award on 10 October at the British Library in London, where she will announce her choice of winner for the PEN Pinter Writer of Courage award, given to an author “active in defence of freedom of expression, often at great risk to their own safety and liberty”.Aboulela’s work “is marked by a commitment to make the lives and decisions of Muslim women central to her fiction, and to examine their struggles and pleasures with dignity,” said novelist Nadifa Mohamed, who judged this year’s prize alongside the poet and author Mona Arshi and the chair of English PEN, Ruth Borthwick. “In a world seemingly on fire, and with immense suffering unmarked and little mourned in Sudan, Gaza, and beyond, her writing is a balm, a shelter, and an inspiration.”Aboulela “offers us nuanced and rich perspectives on themes that are vital in our contemporary world: faith, migration, and displacement,” said Arshi.“She is not the first to write about the experience of migration, but Leila is a writer for this moment, and my hope is that with this prize her gorgeous books find new readers, and open our minds to other possibilities,” added Borthwick.Last year, Arundhati Roywon the prize, and selected the imprisoned British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah as Writer of Courage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We cannot have a nation that is run by terror. We cannot have a nation that is governed by violence.“This country will not be destroyed by a few people who are impatient and who want to have a change of government using unconstitutional means. It is not going to happen.”View image in fullscreenProtesters on the outskirts of Nairobi chanting slogans on Saba Saba day.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/Getty ImagesIn the latest protests, on Monday, Kenyans took to the streets to markSaba Saba(Seven Seven), the day on 7 July 1990 when Kenyans rose up to demand a return to multiparty democracy after years of autocratic rule under Daniel arap Moi.Thirty-one people were killed on Monday and 107 injured, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, bringing the toll to 51 over the past two months, according to Agence France-Presse.Unicef condemned the killing of a 12-year-old girl by a stray bullet while she was at home in Kiambu county, nine miles from the capital, as well as the arrest of children during the protests. “Children must be protected from harm at all times and under all circumstances,” the UN agency said.View image in fullscreenWilliam Ruto speaks at a press conference in Nairobi on 25 June.Photograph: Monicah Mwangi/ReutersThe demonstrations began in June last year as a youth-led movement against a proposed tax increase, and quickly widened to encompass calls for reform and Ruto’s resignation. The governmentwas forced to withdraw the finance billthat contained the proposed rises, and Rutodismissed nearly all of his cabinetin an attempt to control the situation.Police killings and abductions have done little to assuage public anger. Thedeath in police custody last month of a teacherwho had reportedly criticised a senior police official on social media, and the police shooting of a man at close range during a subsequent protest, has refocused attention on the security forces.On occasion, protests have degenerated into looting and violence by some protesters, with thousands of businesses destroyed.View image in fullscreenRiot police use teargas to disperse protesters in Kangemi on the outskirts of Nairobi.Photograph: Donwilson Odhiambo/Getty ImagesRuto was elected on a promise to improve the wellbeing of young and ordinary Kenyans, but many feel he has failed to deliver his economic pledges and has responded in a tone-deaf manner to protesters’ demands.Ruto’s latest comments echo an order to police from the interior minister, Kipchumba Murkomen, two weeks ago to shoot people who approach police stations “with criminal intent”.Opposition leaders, including Ruto’s former deputy and ally Rigathi Gachagua, have accused the government of unleashing “hostile” state-sponsored violence against its citizens. On Tuesday, they called on the public to “boycott all businesses, services and institutions owned, operated or publicly linked to this regime and its enablers”.Ruto’s allies have accused Gachagua of bankrolling violent protests, which he has denied. Gachagua also dismissed Ruto’s claims of a plot to overthrow the government, saying on Wednesday: “We want to remove you … through the ballot in 2027.”View image in fullscreenA protester looks on as a pyre of tyres burns in Nairobi on 7 July.Photograph: Michel Lunanga/Getty ImagesObservers say that Ruto has to endear himself both to a disillusioned public and to younger Kenyans – a strong-willed and defiant generation born after the restoration of multiparty democracy who benefited from free primary education that started in 2003, and who have been leading the push for change since last year.The UN said it was “deeply troubled” over the deaths during this week’s protests and that “intentional lethal force by law enforcement officers, including with firearms, should only be used when strictly necessary to protect life from an imminent threat”.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsKenyaProtestAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That ruling was overturned by the supreme court earlier this month.The group arrived in South Sudan on 5 June with an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saying they had been returned by US marines.A South Sudan foreign ministry spokesperson, Apuk Ayuel Mayen, said Juba maintains a strong commitment to its people, including “its nationals returning under any circumstances” and “persons with recognised links to South Sudan”.Simmering rivalry between South Sudanese president, Salva Kiir, and his vice-president, Riek Machar, boiled over into open hostilities in March.The tensions have raised fears of a return to full-scale war in the world’s youngest country, where a civil war killed 400,000 people in 2013-2018.AFP andthe AP contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsSouth SudanUS immigrationMexicoMyanmarCubaVietnamLaosnewsShareReuse this content"

Today, we enjoyed dinner, this bottle of wine and each other, at the edge of the island,” it said. It asked whomever might find the message to “please call us”, followed by a scribbled number.Thirteen years later and 2,000 miles away, another couple, Kate and John Gay, found the bottle at Scraggane Bay in County Kerry, on Ireland’s western tip. They read the note, toasted Anita and Brad and wondered: were they still together?View image in fullscreenThe note inside the bottle.Photograph: Maharees Heritage and Conservation/FacebookThey rang the number but there was no answer. So on Monday night they posted a message on the Facebook page ofMaharees Heritage and Conservation, an environmental group that had organised the bay cleanup that led to the bottle’s discovery, and waited.The post went viral and within hours friends in Canada had alerted Anita and Brad Squires – now married with three children and living in Newfoundland – to the bottle’s discovery.Map of bottle’s journey“It’s been a pretty whirlwind 48 hours,” Brad told the Guardian on Wednesday. “It was Monday night and I was just putting our youngest son to bed and my phone was ding, ding, ding, ding, which was really unusual. Then I could hear Anita laughing in the other room. Her phone was doing the same thing. I came out and she was like: ‘You cannot believe this.’”The couple, who had been dating for a year before the Bell Island excursion, married in 2016. Anita is a nurse and Brad has just retired as a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer.“We were just young people in love,” Brad told RTÉ radio’sMorning Ireland show. “We’re now older people in love. We’re glad that the story got out. We’re meeting new friends because of it and hopefully we’ll get back to Ireland soon.”Martha Farrell, of the Maharees Conservation Association, said the story had prompted other couples in Canada to get in touch to share their own stories of sending messages in bottles across the Atlantic.Explore more on these topicsIrelandCanadaEuropeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Russia “is responsible for killing my son”, Schansman said.The Boeing 777 was shot down on 17 July 2014 using a Russian-made Buk missile fired from territory in eastern Ukraine controlled by separatist rebels loyal to Moscow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The victims came from 17 countries and included 198 Dutch nationals, 43 Malaysians, 38 Australians and 10 from the UK.The judges found that Russia’s refusal to acknowledge its involvement in the flight MH17 disaster also violated international law. Russia’s failure to properly investigate “significantly aggravated the suffering” of the relatives and friends of the dead.“Russia never took any opportunity to tell the truth,” Schansman said.In May, the UN’s aviation agencyfound Russia responsiblefor the disaster afterAustralia and the Netherlands launched legal proceedingsagainst Russia under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation.The ECHR is an important part of the Council of Europe, the continent’s foremost human rights institution. The court’s governing body expelled Moscow in 2022 in response to the all-out invasion, but the court can still deal with cases against Russia dating from before its expulsion and, legally, the country is still obliged to participate in the proceedings.The court will rule on financial compensation at a later date but Russia’s departure leaves little hope that damages will ever be collected.The decisions in Strasbourg are separate from a criminal prosecution in the Netherlands in which two Russians and a Ukrainian rebel were convicted in absentia of multiple murders for their roles in the downing of Flight MH17.Explore more on these topicsMalaysia Airlines flight MH17RussiaEuropePlane crashesUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

The average RAD is $470,000, with the lump sum refunded to family members when a resident dies.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailElderly people whose care is paid for by the government rely on a supported accommodation supplement, worth $70 per day.Changes from the new laws were due to come into force from 1 July, but were delayed until November over concerns about implementation capacity.Burton told Guardian Australia the significant difference in value acts as a strong disincentive for homes to accept supported residents.“If you’ve got one bed left, it is going to be a difficult financial decision for them,” she said.“If there’s not enough beds to go around, and somebody is going to contribute through the government supplement of $69 a day, compared to someone who will likely pay double that per day, it’s a very difficult for providers to actually prioritise the people without means.”Burton wants the government to move more quickly than a planned review of the supplement, due to be completed by mid-2026. She will propose it be raised, or tied to mandated equivalent rate to the RAD.Uniting cares for nearly 8,000 residents across 75 homesin New South Wales and the ACT and supports 8,500 home care clients.Burton cited the case of an elderly man from the NSW Central Coast who was moved to a home in Sydney because no bed was available closer to his support network.“The unintended consequence of people of means contributing more to their aged care is that they could get priority access over people who are relying on the government support,” Burton said.Occupancy in aged care in Australia’s major cities is above 94%, according to the most recent research. In regional centres, it exceeds 92%.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The country is on track for a doubling of people over 65 and a tripling of those aged over 85 within 40 years.Grant Corduroy, an aged care expert and member of Labor’s expert taskforce, endorsed Burton’s calls for action.“The current accomodation supplement is inequitable for financially disadvantaged people compared to people who have the financial ability to pay,” he said.Aged care homes accused of ‘short-changing’ Australians as nearly two-thirds fail to meet care-minute targetsRead more“With increasing occupancy levels, where demand will soon start to outstrip supply, it means providers will have greater choice among the residents they accept. We don’t want providers to be faced with having to make that choice based on financial reasons, rather than the needs assessment of a resident.”To incentivise providers to prioritise financially vulnerable residents, aged care homes that fall below 40% supported residents have their supplement rates reduced by 25%.The supplement review is expected to consider if it is priced in a way to incentivise providers to accept low-means residents.The minister for aged care, Sam Rae, said Labor was determined to make sure the accommodation supplement provided “appropriate incentives so that people who need it most can access care, even if they aren’t well off”.“The review of accommodation pricing will consult widely, and I look forward to receiving the report and learning how we can further improve care and support for older Australians doing it tough,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAged careLabor partyRoyal commission into aged care quality and safetynewsShareReuse this content"

A No 10 spokesperson said afterwards: “The leaders agreed tackling the threat of irregular migration and small boat crossings is a shared priority that requires shared solutions.”Starmer has prioritised signing a “one-in, one-out” deal which would have led to Britain accepting asylum seekers who could show a family connection to the UK, but returning those who could not.The French newspaper Le Mondereported on Wednesdaythat an initial pilot scheme would mean Britain would send back only 2,600 people a year – about 6% of the total number of crossings. But British officials hope they can increase those numbers after any pilot scheme ends.With negotiations going on into Wednesday evening, aides on both sides said there remained significant areas of disagreement, one of which is money.The UK signed a £480m deal two years ago to pay for additional border patrols and surveillance equipment such as drones and night-vision binoculars. Since then the French have agreed to intercept boats in the sea which are up to 300 metres from their shore, and arenow asking for extra fundingto pay for police officers, boats and drones to enforce that policy.France has been looking for money to expand its Compagnie de Marche, a specialist unit of officers which operates on beaches to tackle the people-smuggling trade and intercept crossings.Other obstacles to the deal include opposition from the southern European countries of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain, all of which have experienced high levels of irregular migration.This so-called Med 5 group is concerned that asylum seekers who are sent back from the UK to France could then decide to travel back through Europe to their countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionStarmer, meanwhile, has sought to assuage Macron’s concerns about the UK’s hidden economy, which the French president believes acts as a “pull factor”, encouraging migrants to cross the Channel and find illegal work.The PM has announced a number of policies to tackle illegal work, including more immigration enforcement raids. One government aide said: “If the French were asking us to do more illegal working raids, we would be fine with that.”A No 10 spokesperson said Starmer had used Wednesday’s meeting to stress the action the UK is taking on this front.“[He] spoke of his government’s toughening of the system in the past year to ensure rules are respected and enforced, including a massive surge in illegal working arrests to end the false promise of jobs that are used to sell spaces on boats,” the person said.One final concern on the French side, diplomats said, is that their policy of stopping boats 300 metres away from shore may be susceptible to challenge in their domestic courts.UK sources said on Wednesday the deal was still a possibility, although some European officials were pessimistic about the chances of it being agreed during this visit.One French diplomatic source described the idea as “a hostage to fortune”, saying the UK had made few guarantees about how many people they would take and that agreement with the wider EU looked as remote as ever.Britain and France also said on Wednesday they would be willing to mount a joint nuclear response to an extreme military threat – possibly from countries such as Russia and China – and that “any adversary threatening the vital interests of Britain or France” could be confronted by the “nuclear forces of both nations”.The joint nuclear declaration, a first, forms part of a deepened Lancaster House defence cooperation agreement announced between the two countries, which also sees the two place orders for more Storm Shadow missiles, and begin work on a next generation anti-ship missile together.The UK described the new agreement as an “entente industrielle” and said it would support more than 300 jobs at the Stevenage production line where Storm Shadow missiles are made by Anglo-French manufacturer MBDA. The number of new missiles being ordered was not made clear.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumFranceKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronEuropeMigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Civilians and prisoners of war were subjected to mock executions, the severing of body parts and electric shocks, including to intimate areas of their bodies, the court said.Finding repeated violations of the convention, many of which had taken place over a period of more than eight years, the court said: “These actions seek to undermine the very fabric of the democracy on which the Council of Europe and its member states are founded by their destruction of individual freedoms, their suppression of political liberties and their blatant disregard for the rule of law.“In none of the conflicts previously before the court has there been such near universal condemnation of the ‘flagrant’ disregard by the respondent state for the foundations of the international legal order established after the second world war.”Ukraine hailed the judgment as “historic and unprecedented”, saying it was an “undeniable victory”. Russia did not participate in the proceedings and said it would ignore the judgment.Violations identified by the court included:Indiscriminate military attacks.Summary executions of civilians and Ukrainian military personnel.Torture, including the use of rape as a weapon of war.Unlawful and arbitrary detention of civilians.Unjustified displacement and transfer of civilians.Intimidation, harassment and persecution of all religious groups other than adherents of the historically Moscow-aligned Ukrainian Orthodox church.Intimidation and violence against journalists and new laws prohibiting and penalising the dissemination of information in support of Ukraine.Forcible dispersal by the Russian military of peaceful protests in occupied towns and cities.Destruction, looting and expropriation of property.Suppression of the Ukrainian language in schools and indoctrination of Ukrainian schoolchildren.Transfer toRussia, and in many cases, the adoption there of Ukrainian children.The court said: “The prevalence of sexual violence and rape by Russian soldiers in occupied territory is especially abhorrent. The evidence shows the extreme violence of the circumstances in which women were raped or sexually assaulted and the intent to terrorise, humiliate and debase them … In addition to the impact on the direct victims, the raping of women and girls in the context of an armed conflict has also been described as a means for the aggressor to symbolically and physically humiliate the defeated men.“Rape or the threat of rape is also used to drive communities off lands or to heighten terror during attacks. The evidence also attests to the horrific sexual violence frequently perpetrated upon male detainees. The sexual abuse, torture and mutilation of male detainees is often carried out to attack and destroy their sense of masculinity or manhood.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, Russia has previously told the court of its intention not to enforce judgments or pay damages.A total of 26 signatory states to the convention intervened as third parties in the case and expressed their support for making Russia accountable for violations of human rights arising from its invasion of Ukraine.The court also found that theshooting down of flight MH17using a missile supplied and transported to eastern Ukraine by the Russian Federation, resulting in the deaths of all 298 civilians onboard, was in breach of the convention.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineEuropean court of human rightsEuropeHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

He described her as “extremely effective, charismatic and one of our most successful ambassadors”.He indicated that several top ambassadors to G7 and G20 countries would also be moved, tellingUkrainian radio“Every diplomat has a rotation cycle”.The diplomatic shake-up comes at a critical moment in the war. Russian troops have been attacking across the 600-mile frontline and in recent weeks the speed of their gains has increased, with the Kremlin spokesperson declaring: “We are advancing.”Russian combat units are for the first time close to crossing into Dnipropetrovsk oblast.Late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday, Russia carried out its biggest aerial attack since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022. It involved a record 728 Shahed-type drones, as well as 13 cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down.The US House of Representatives speaker, Mike Johnson, is among the Republican figures who havecriticised Markarova, accusing her of supporting the Democratic party and its candidate Kamala Harris in the run-up to last November’s presidential election.View image in fullscreenMike Johnson, US speaker of the House, is among the senior politicians who have criticised the ambassador.Photograph: Mariam Zuhaib/APIn February she waspictured with her head in her handduring Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s disastrous meeting with Donald Trump in the Oval Office.There werecalls for her dismissalafter Zelenskyy visited a shell factory in Pennsylvania last September. Markarova organised the visit and did not invite a single Republican, Johnson said at the time.Ukrainian officials deny any bias but acknowledge the ambassador previously had good relations with the Biden administration and was close to Victoria Nuland, the then undersecretary of state for political affairs.Zelenskyy and Trump discussed Markarova’s departure during a phone call last Friday which Ukraine’s president hailed as their most constructive to date.On Tuesday, Trumpexpressed growing frustration with Vladimir Putinand announced US weapons deliveries to Kyiv would be restarted. His announcement followed a week-long pause, apparently ordered by Pete Hegseth, the US secretary of defense.Pope offers to hold talks with Russia after meeting Zelenskyy – as it happenedRead moreThe shipment includes Patriot interceptor missiles and other precision munitions. It is unclear how many will be transferred. The US news website Axios reported 10 missiles would be delivered – a tiny amount at a time when Moscow has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Ukrainian cities.The overnight raid was directed at the northwestern city of Lutsk. At least six civilians were killed and 39 injured in several other regions of the country, including Kharkiv and Donetsk in the north-east and east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south.A one-year-old boy, Dmytro, died in the village of Pravdyne in Kherson oblast when the Russians hit his house with drones, the local administration reported. The boy had been staying with his great-grandmother.One possible successor to Markarova in Washington is said to be Ihor Zhovkva, the deputy head of the office of Ukraine’s president. Zhovka’s immediate boss is Andriy Yermak, who is widely seen as the most influential person in Ukrainian politics after Zelenskyy.Other names include the finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, and Olha Stefanishyna, who is deputy prime minister forEuropeand Euro-Atlantic integration, as well as minister of justice.There is growing optimism in Kyiv that Trump’s pivot earlier this year towards Russia has been halted, if not quite reversed. One former Ukrainian officialcredited Jonathan Powell, the UK’s national security adviser and a veteran negotiator, with the transformation.Powell has played an important role in repairing Zelenskyy’s fraught relations with Washington after the Oval Office bust-up.He advised Ukraine’s government to avoid confronting the US president and to take his words as truth. The approach – described as “strategic patience” – was beginning to pay off, the official suggested.Zelenskyy has agreed to US proposals for a 30-day ceasefire, repeatedly praised Trump’s leadership, and signed a deal giving American investors access to Ukraine’s valuable natural resources.On Wednesday he met Pope Leo in Rome before a two-day international conference, organised to help Ukraine’s postwar recovery. Zelenskyy said they had discussed the return of Ukrainian children and civilians who had been abducted by Russia and the Vatican’s offer to facilitate peace negotiations.Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is due to attend the conference. Ina recent call with Trump, Merz reportedly offered to buy Patriot anti-defence batteriesfrom the US and to send them to Ukraine.Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, is also due in Rome and is likely to hold talks on weapons deliveries with Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s defence minister.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS politicsEuropeMike JohnsonDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyRepublicansnewsShareReuse this content"

The offices and homes of several company executives were also searched.The investigation involved “acts that may constitute fraud, loans exceeding campaign finance regulations, aggravated laundering of fraud, forgery and the use of forged documents between 2020 and 2024”, the prosecutors said in a statement.The EU prosecutors’ investigation follows a European parliament report alleging that the ID group, which included MEPs from RN, Italy’s Lega, Germany’s AfD and other far-right parties, had improperly spent more than €4m of EU money.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sometimes within just half an hour we receive over 100 to 150 cases, ranging from severe injuries to deaths … About 95% of these injuries and deaths come from food distribution centres – what are referred to as the ‘American food distribution centres’,” Saqr said.Graphic showing people killed and injured in Gaza seeking aidThe casualties among those seeking aid – which totalled 640 killed and more than 4,500 injured between 27 May and 2 July,according to the ministry of health in Gaza– have strained a system that is already close to collapse.“Every bed is occupied by a patient, and these additional injuries place an unimaginable burden on us. We are forced to treat patients on the floor of the emergency department … Most of these injuries are gunshot wounds to the chest and head … Patients [are] arriving with amputated legs and arms,” Saqr said.Hospitals and clinics also have to deal with casualties from Israeli airstrikes that kill dozens and injure many more – even as the US president, Donald Trump, pushes for a ceasefire that might end the war and free dozens of Israeli hostages. On Wednesday, between 20 and 44 people were killed, according to officials in Gaza.In Qatar, indirect talks between Israel and Hamas stretched into a fourth day without any breakthrough, though Gideon Saar, the Israeli foreign minister, said a deal was “achievable” and Hamas said it would release 10 hostages as part of Gaza ceasefire talks.On Wednesday Trump said there was a “very good chance” of a ceasefire in Gaza this week or next, after meeting Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Tuesday for the second time in two days to discuss the situation. “We have a chance this week or next week,” Trump told reporters.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) also said its doctors in Gaza had seen a sharp rise over the past month in mass casualty incidents linked to aid distribution sites.Since the launch of the new food distribution system, which Israel says is necessary to prevent Hamas diverting humanitarian assistance, the ICRC’s 60-bed field hospital in Rafah, in the south of Gaza, has treated more than 2,200 weapon-wounded patients and has registered more than 200 deaths.“The scale and frequency of these incidents are without precedent. In just over a month, the number of patients treated has surpassed the total seen in all mass casualty events during the entire previous year,” the ICRC said in a statement.“Among the wounded are toddlers, teenagers, elderly, mothers – and overwhelmingly, young men and boys. Most say they were simply trying to get food or aid for their families.”An 86-bed field hospital run by UK-Med in al-Mawasi, on the coast of southern Gaza, has also received many casualties who were seeking aid when they were hurt.“Since I arrived there have been a lot of gunshot injuries. They tell me how they were injured, and say it was at or near food distribution sites,” said Dr Clare Jeffrys, a British emergency medicine specialist who is working at the hospital.One patient with severe abdominal wounds told Jeffrys he had been injured as he picked up a box of food at a distribution site.There was no independent confirmation of the claim and the GHF has strenuously denied that any injuries were inflicted at any of its sites, blaming Israeli troops firing on Palestinians trying to reach the four hubs they have established in southern and central Gaza.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks overlook a distribution centre in Khan Younis.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APIt said in a statement: “To date, there have been no incidents or fatalities at or in the immediate vicinity of any of our distribution sites during our operating hours.”The organisation said this week it had distributed 62m meals in the territory and was “working tirelessly to distribute free food aid directly to the people of Gaza safely and without interference”.The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not target civilians, takes all feasible precautions to avoid harm to non-combatants and abides by international law.But after a report in the newspaper Haaretz, which quoted soldiers describing orders to fire on civilians seeking aid, Israel’s military saidit was reviewingits operations around aid distribution sites.Jeffrys said the UK-Med hospital was also suffering from acute shortages of basic supplies.“We are really struggling … We are running out of external fixators, which are vital for [treating] open fractures, and critical medicines including painkillers, antibiotics and anaesthetics. For some things, there is just zero stock,” she said.The healthcare system in Gaza has been decimated during the 21-month conflict, which was triggered in October 2023 when Hamas militants launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 250 hostages.In the ensuing offensive that Israel launched into Gaza, more than 57,000 Palestinians have been killed, mostly civilians, and much of the territory has been reduced to rubble.Q&AWhy is it so difficult to report on Gaza?ShowCoverage of the war in Gaza is constrained by Israeli attacks on Palestinian journalists and a bar on international reporters entering the Gaza Strip to report independently on the war.Israel has not allowed foreign reporters to enter Gaza since 7 October 2023, unless they are under Israeli military escort. Reporters who join these trips have no control over where they go, and otherrestrictionsinclude a bar on speaking to Palestinians in Gaza.Palestinian journalists and media workers inside Gaza have paid a heavy price for their work reporting on the war, with over180 killedsince the conflict began.The committee to protect journalists has determined that at least 19 of them “were directly targeted by Israeli forces in killings which CPJ classifies as murders”.Foreign reporters based in Israel filed alegal petitionseeking access to Gaza, but it was rejected by the supreme court on security grounds. Private lobbying by diplomats and public appeals byprominent journalistsandmedia outletshave been ignored by the Israeli government.To ensure accurate reporting from Gaza given these restrictions, the Guardian works with trusted journalists on the ground; our visual​​ teams verif​y photo and videos from third parties; and we use clearly sourced data from organisations that have a track record of providing accurate information in Gaza during past conflicts, or during other conflicts or humanitarian crises.Emma Graham-Harrison, chief Middle East correspondentWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nearly half of the territory’s 36 hospitals have been put out of service and the remaining facilities are operating at a fraction of their usual capacity. All struggle with acute shortages of essential medical supplies and basic equipment such as respirators, X-ray machines, scanners or even lamps for operating theatres.“Staff are racing to treat an unrelenting tide of injuries, the vast majority caused by gunfire … [which] has overwhelmed Gaza’s shattered healthcare system, pushing its already-diminished capacity past its limit,” the ICRC said.Shortages were more acute now than since the beginning of the war, medics said, with a lack of fuel, which runs generators that provide almost all power, threatening an almost total shutdown of all medical services.For 11 weeks, Israel blocked all food, medicine and other supplies from entering Gaza, accusing Hamas of diverting aid to fund its military and other activities, though the UN said its monitoring systems were robust. Since mid-May, Israel has allowed in a trickle of aid, including medical supplies.“In the previous rotations, we would work in the operating theatre on between eight and 10 cases. Right now, we are working on 30-40 cases a day,” said Haitam al-Hasan, an operating theatre nurse at the ICRC’s Rafah hospital.“We have people screaming, rushing, trying to be the first in the line because, of course, everybody wants to be treated first. We have a variety of injuries, mostly complex injuries, blast injuries, but mainly gunshot injuries.”According to the Gaza health ministry, 1,580 doctors and medical personnel have been killed in the conflict.On 2 July,an Israeli airstrike killed Dr Marwan al-Sultan, a renowned and highly experienced cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in Gaza.Among the healthcare workers killed in the past 50 days were three other doctors, the chief nurses of the Indonesian hospital and al-Nasser children’s hospital, one of Gaza’s most senior midwives, a senior radiology technician and dozens of young medical graduates and trainee nurses.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaPalestinian territoriesIsraelAidMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Rescuers are still searching for missing crew members.Eternity C wasfirst attacked on Monday afternoonwith sea drones and rocket-propelled grenades fired from speedboats by Yemen-based Houthi militants, maritime security sources said. Two security sources said on Wednesday that the vessel was attacked again on Tuesday night, forcing the crew to jump into the water.There were fears that some of the crew who jumped into the water may have been kidnapped byHouthis. Skiffs were in the area as the rescue efforts were under way.The Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, expressing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and saying the vessel was heading towards Eilat inIsrael. Their military spokesperson, Yahya Saree, said: “The naval force of the Yemeni armed forces targeted the ship.”The Iran-backed group also claimed responsibility on Sunday for a similar attack targeting another vessel, the Magic Seas. All crew from the Magic Seas were rescued before it sank.The incidents signal a resumption of attacks by the Houthis on vessels in the Red Sea. They started in November 2023 but paused attacks in December 2024.Both of the ships that were attacked flew Liberia flags and were operated by Greek firms. An official at the Greek-based maritime risk management firm Diaplous said: “We will continue to search for the remaining crew until the last light. We aim at a peaceful operation.”Four Eternity C crew members – one Russian and three Filipinos – were killed in the attack, a representative of UK Maritime Trade Operations said.The crew was made up of 21 Filipinos and one Russian, and the ship’s four armed guards included a Greek national.The UK-based security firm Ambrey told AFP that the Eternity C was badly damaged and sank off the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah, which is under the control of the Houthis.The halt in attacks in December coincided with the announcement of a ceasefire in Gaza. The Houthis pledged to stop attacks on all but Israeli-owned vessels. The group later threatened to target Israeli vessels after Israel withdrew from the Gaza ceasefire in mid-March, which prompted a US bombing campaign in Yemen.The Houthis and the US agreed to a ceasefire in May after months of US bombings, in exchange for the Houthis agreeing to keep shipping lanes open. In late June, the Houthis indicated they could resume attacks on Israeli ships in the Red Sea if the US struck Iran, the group’s chief patron.Donald Trump struck three Iranian nuclear facilities on 22 June, which the Houthis condemned. They vowed to continue their resistance.The Houthis say they are targeting Israel-affiliated ships to show solidarity with Palestinians and to put pressure on the Israeli military to end its assault on Gaza.After Sunday’s attack, the Houthis said ships owned by companies linked to Israel were a legitimate target and they pledged to continue targeting Israeli-affiliated ships “until the aggression against Gaza stops and the blockade is lifted”.While neither the Magic Seas nor Eternity C were Israeli-owned, they had docked in the country in the past.The US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said after the attack on Tuesday: “These attacks demonstrate the ongoing threat that Iran-backed Houthi rebels pose to freedom of navigation and to regional economic and maritime security.”The Eternity C’s operator, Cosmoship Management, has not responded to requests for confirmation of casualties or injuries.Greek government officials have been in diplomatic talks with Saudi Arabia, a key player in the region, over the incident, according to sources.The deaths are the first involving attacks on shipping in the Red Sea since June 2024.Explore more on these topicsHouthisYemenShipping industryMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

I am asking for justice,” he says in the letter dated 22 June.“This is not just a question of employment. It is a question of human rights, dignity, and moral responsibility. If the EU can dismiss a staff member under these conditions, what message does it send to all those who believe in the values the EU claims to defend?” he adds.View image in fullscreenBaraka’s house was reduced to rubble after surrounding buildings were targeted three times in a hunt for Hamas tunnels, he says.Baraka served with the EU border assistance mission (EUBam) at Rafah after its inception in 2006 as an unarmed civilian third-party presence at the border between Gaza and Egypt to assist in the administration of crossings.The only staff member based in Gaza, he was evacuated to Cairo in November 2023, but continued to work for the office assisting with the passage of NGO personnel including doctors and humanitarian aid.He now cannot return to Gaza; his house had been bombed and more than 100 members of his extended family had been killed in the war, he said. In Egypt he fears for his family’s future. With a seriously ill wife, he has written to a former EU diplomat in the region for help. “Please if something happened to me, please take care of my daughters. They have no one here if I die,” he wrote.The diplomat, who has intervened on his behalf, has urged the EU’s high representative, Kaja Kallas, to approach Egypt’s foreign minister “to immediately secure a residency and work permit in Cairo” for Baraka.If the EU failed to secure his right to stay in Egypt, it should “relocate and continue to employ him in Brussels”, added the diplomat, who asked not to be named.The EU has said his evacuation from the war zone, which it assisted with, was “voluntary”. It says it is providing Baraka with a “comprehensive financial and welfare severance package” in view of the “exceptional circumstances” of his case. But it said it was unable to help with residency rights or work permits in Egypt.Baraka says his two children witnessed atrocities in Gaza and have been unable to go to school for two years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is standard practice when offices are closed, and consistent with how such situations are handled across EU missions globally.”The spokesperson added: “In view of the exceptional circumstances, the EU is providing Mr Baraka with a comprehensive financial and welfare severance package following the end of his contract.

The previous record was 47 degrees, set in 1971.The region, which spans the Himalayas, the Hindu Kush and the Karakoram mountain ranges, has witnessed an acceleration in the melting of its glaciers in the past week.It has led to the swelling of the local rivers and the formation of unstable lakes that have burst, triggering flash floods and landslides that have washed away villages and roads, cutting off some communities entirely and leaving others without power or drinking water.The head of Gilgit-Baltistan’s disaster management authority, Zakir Hussain, said the region was facing a “very serious situation” and described the fast formation of volatile glacial lakes as “highly hostile” to people’s safety.He said those in some areas close to the glaciers were being evacuated from their homes. “We are facing a flood situation in many areas,” he said. “The rise of temperature has sent a shiver down our spines. We have never before witnessed such weather here.”He said it could be just the beginning and that the region remained on high alert as warnings of high temperatures continued.There are about 7,200 glaciers in Gilgit-Baltistan, though their number and size has diminished over recent years as a result of the climate emergency. The glaciers feed vital river basins and are an essential part of Pakistan’s water supply.Tariq Ali, a resident in Gilgit, said the flash floods and high temperatures had devastated swathes of agricultural land, which most people relied on for their livelihoods.“It is like hell,” said Ali. “There has been no rain for quite some time, we are only seeing heatwaves and are witnessing very serious ice-melting. I personally have never witnessed such summer conditions in Gilgit.”Pakistan floods: before-and-after images show extent of devastationRead morePakistan, with a population of 240 million, is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of the climate crisis, facing erratic rains and a high risk of floods and severe heatwaves. .

Where it is, the cause is not just cosmetic, it is economic. Policies relating to shopfronts, rents or parking miss the bigger picture.Affluent city centres have fewer shop vacancies“City centres that struggle are oversupplied with shops and undersupplied with people. If local residents don’t have money to spend or a reason to be in the centre, high streets suffer – no matter what interventions are made.”In more affluent areas, for example, high streets have been able to shift towards dining and drinking and other leisure activities as a portion of traditional shopping activity has shifted online, because residents have spare cash to spend on non-essentials.In poorer areas where fewer people live in the city centre, the lack of spending power means this shift has not happened and funding is needed to bring people back.“A struggling high street is the outcome of a struggling [local] economy, not the other way round,” the report said.In more affluent York, London and Edinburgh, about £1 in every £4 is spent on dining out and relatively few stores are empty – just over 9%. In London, the vacancy rate was 7.4%. However in Bradford, Stoke and Wigan – which are among the locations with the highest vacancy rates – it is about £1 in every £10 and vacancy rates are more than 16%.The spending power of a local population is not just measured by high-paying jobs but also the number of people in a catchment compared with the size of a high street.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said theConservativesand Labour had “wrecked” the country over the past 20 years.In an articlefor the Sun, Berry said he was leaving the Conservative party after 25 years as a member and 14 as an MP. He said his former party shared responsibility with Labour for the state of the UK.“I hear from people in my community and beyond who say the same thing – ‘This isn’t the Britain I grew up in.’ And they’re right,” he wrote.“It didn’t start with Labour. The Conservative governments I was part of share the blame … If you were deliberately trying to wreck the country, you’d be hard-pressed to do a better job than the last two decades of Labour and Tory rule.“Millions of people, just like me, want a country they can be proud of again. The only way we get that is with Reform in government. That’s why I’ve resigned from the Conservative party. I’m now backing Reform UK and working to make them the next party of government.”The former MP for Rossendale and Darwen said that people who had believed in Johnson’s levelling up agenda in northern English seats had been particularly let down.“The truth is, the Conservatives have lost their way. They’ve abandoned their principles. They’ve abandoned the British people. And they’ve abandoned me,” he wrote.Berry, who will bring significant organising experience to Reform, said that his new party “is now the real opposition. Not the Conservatives. Not the Lib Dems. They’ve had their chance and now Reform represents our last chance.”Berry is the fifth former Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK in recent years and the second ex-cabinet minister, after the former Welsh secretary David Jones.Lee Anderson, who was Conservative MP for Ashfield, defected during the previous parliament and is one of Reform UK’s four MPs. Others who have defected include the ex-MP Marco Longhi and Andrea Jenkyns, who is the Reform mayor for Greater Lincolnshire.No sitting Conservative MP has defected during this parliament, though there are significant concerns among party officials that the former home secretary Suella Braverman might consider moving to Farage’s party.Berry lost his seat in Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire in last July’s general election to Labour’s Andy MacNae, who had a majority of 6,000 over him.MacNae won with 18,247 votes to Berry’s 12,619, while Reform’s candidate, Daniel Matchett, followed in third with 9,695 votes.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Heartbreaking accusations that Moth has made up his illness have been made, leaving us devastated.”In a statement on her website, she said that the article was “grotesquely unfair, highly misleading and seeks to systematically pick apart my life”.Winn, 63, continued: “The Salt Path is about what happened to Moth and me, after we lost our home and found ourselves homeless on the headlands of the south-west.“It’s not about every event or moment in our lives, but rather about a capsule of time when our lives moved from a place of complete despair to a place of hope.“The journey held within those pages is one of salt and weather, of pain and possibility. And I can’t allow any more doubt to be cast on the validity of those memories, or the joy they have given so many.”In The Salt Path, the couple lose their house due to a bad business investment. But the Observer reported that the couple lost their home after an accusation that Winn had stolen thousands of pounds from her employer.It also said that it had spoken to medical experts who were sceptical about Moth having CBD, given his lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them.Winn’s publishing house,Penguin, said it “undertook all the necessary pre-publication due diligence”, including a contract with an author warranty about factual accuracy, and a legal read.It added: “Prior to the Observer inquiry, we had not received any concerns about the book’s content.”PSPA, a charity that supports people with CBD and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), said it had “terminated” its relationship with the couple after the Observer article.Winn had been scheduled to make numerous appearances this summer, performing with Saltlines, her collaboration with Gigspanner Big Band. However, the band subsequently announced on social media that she will no longer be taking part in the tour.Explore more on these topicsRaynor WinnPenguinnewsShareReuse this content"

Both Israel and the US, which provides military support, have strongly denied that accusation.In recent weeks, Albanese has issued a series of letters, urging other countries to pressure Israel, including through sanctions, to end its deadly bombardment of the Gaza Strip. The Italian national has also been a strong supporter of the international criminal court’s indictment of Israeli officials, including the prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, for war crimes. She most recently issued a report naming several US giants among companies aiding what she described as Israel’s occupation and war on Gaza.US vetoes resolution for unconditional Gaza ceasefire at UN security councilRead more“Albanese’s campaign of political and economic warfare against the United States and Israel will no longer be tolerated,” the secretary of state,Marco Rubio, posted on social media. “We will always stand by our partners in their right to self-defense.”Albanese has been the target of criticism from pro-Israel officials and groups in the US and in the Middle East. Last week, the US mission to the UN issued a scathing statement, calling for her removal for “a years-long pattern of virulent anti-Semitism and unrelenting anti-Israel bias”.The statement said that Albanese’s allegations of Israel committing genocide or apartheid are “false and offensive”.It is all a culmination of an extraordinary and sprawling campaign of nearly six months by theTrump administrationto quell criticism of Israel’s handling of the deadly war in Gaza, which is closing in on two years. Earlier this year, the Trump administration began arresting and deporting faculty and students of American universities who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations and other political activities.The war between Israel and Hamas began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and killed nearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people captive. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which says women and children make up most of the dead but does not specify how many were fighters or civilians.Nearly 21 months into the conflict that displaced the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, it is nearly impossible for the critically wounded to get the care they need, doctors and aid workers say.“We must stop this genocide, whose short-term goal is completing the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, while also profiteering from the killing machine devised to perform it,” Albanese said in a recent post on X. “No one is safe until everyone is safe.”Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policyMarco RubioTrump administrationUnited NationsPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Newsom in a March podcast interview with the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk called transgender participation in girls’ sports “deeply unfair”.“Not only is it ’deeply unfair,’ it is also illegal under federal law,” Bondi said in a statement. “This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect equal opportunities for women and girls in sports.”Gavin Newsom sues Fox News for defamation and demands $787mRead moreA spokesperson for Newsom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump, a Republican, has signed a series of executive orders restricting transgender rights, including a February directive to strip federal funding for any school that allows transgender women or girls to compete in female sports.The suit comes weeks after theeducation departmentannounced it had found California allegedly violated the law by permittingtrans girlsto compete on girls’ sports teams, and proposed that the state strip trans athletes of their records and awards and bar trans women from competing in women’s sports.California has allowed trans girls to compete in girls’ sports for more than a decade – a policy that attracted little outcry until Republicans and anti-LGBTQ+ groups seized on the issue in recent years.The justice department under Trump has already filed a similar lawsuit against Maine and has made challenging transgender rights a major civil rights priority. The lawsuit alleges that state policies “ignore undeniable biological differences between boys and girls” and diminish the integrity of girls’ sports. Advocates for LGBTQ+ rights have said transgender athletes comprise a small minority of all school athletes and bans on their participation further stigmatize a vulnerable population.California’s policies drew national attention earlier this year when a transgender girl competing in the state track and field championship won the high jump and triple jump and finished second in the long jump, an episode cited in the justice department’s complaint. Ahead of that competition, the governing board forCaliforniahigh school sports had announced it would change the rules to allow more girls to take part.The athlete who won, 16-year-oldAB Hernandez, was subjected to harassment from anti-LGBTQ+ activists and targeted by the president himself who said that her participation was “demeaning” to women and girls and said he was “ordering local authorities, if necessary, to not allow” her to participate.In aninterview with the Guardian,Hernandez said that despite the criticism, she had the support of her classmates. “They see how hard I train,” she said. One of her competitors told the San Francisco Chronicle: “Sharing the podium was nothing but an honor.”TheTrump administrationlawsuit cites five alleged instances of transgender athletes taking part in girls’ school sporting events in a state with nearly 6 million public school students, according to state data.It seeks a court order barring any school under the California Interscholastic Federation from allowing transgender athletes to take part in girls’ sports competitions and to establish a process to compensate female athletes it alleges have been harmed by the state’s policy.Newsom has repeatedly clashed with Trump, most recently over the president’s decision to deploy national guard troops to Los Angeles, California’s largest city, to quell anti-deportation protests that erupted after the Trump administration carried out workplace raids in the city.The feud has prompted several legal battles between the Trump administration and the largest US state. The justice department under Trump has already launched an investigation into hiring practices at the University of California system and has sued Los Angeles over policies restricting the city’s cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.Newsom sued the Trump administration over the national guard deployment.Explore more on these topicsUS newsDonald TrumpPam BondiTrump administrationGavin NewsomCaliforniaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The other 24 people who have died are from surrounding areas.

Journalistic investigations have revealed that first responders asked that a mass-alert system in Kerr county be triggered on Friday morning. The alert system sends text messages and “delivers pre-recorded emergency telephone messages” to some people in the area.Dispatchers delayed a 4.22am request from volunteer firefighters for an alert to be sent, saying they needed special authorization, according toreporting from Texas Public Radio (TPR)based on emergency radio transmissions they reviewed. Some residents received flood warnings within an hour. Others told TPR they did not receive an alert until 10am – nearly six hours after first responders’ request. Aseparate storyfrom KSAT confirms TPR’s reporting.There are inconsistencies regarding local officials’ response. In his first press conference on 4 July after the flood, the Kerr county judge said the area did not have an emergency alert system.“I believe those questions need to be answered, to the families of the missed loved ones, to the public, you know, to the people who put me in this office. And I want that answer and we’re going to get that answer,” the Kerr county sheriff, Larry Leitha, said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was held to 4 acres (1.6 hectares) with no damage to structures.Police initially detained two juveniles who they later determined were witnesses, not suspects, the city said in a statement on Tuesday.“Officers later obtained video evidence clearly showing a juvenile suspect lighting a firework and fleeing the scene,” the statement said.The 13-year-old was taken into custody a short time later and could face charges including felony reckless burning of forest land, officials said. The teen was released to his parents.The Laguna Beach blaze was one of dozens of wildfires burning this week in the state. The risk of fire was especially high on Wednesday as temperatures spiked and humidity dropped across inland southernCalifornia.The Madre fire became California’s largest blaze so far this year, ripping through grasslands after breaking out 2 July in south-eastern San Luis Obispo county. By Wednesday, it covered more than 125 sq miles (323 sq km). It was more than 60% contained.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresCaliforniaWildfiresWest CoastUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.”Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and later renamed it X. The billionaire hired Yaccarino the following year, after he fired much of the platform’s staff and announced major changes such as ending content moderation policies. Before joining X, Yaccarino had been a longtime executive at NBCUniversal who focused on advertising and partnerships. In March, Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI acquired the social networking company.Over the course of Yaccarino’s tenure as CEO, she frequently had to put a positive spin on public relations disasters and Musk’s belligerent behavior. A few months after hiring Yaccarino, Musk gave a public appearance in whichhe told advertisersto “go fuck yourself” and leave the platform after backlash to his promotion of an antisemitic post. Yaccarino defended his conduct and the company in interviews.Yaccarino’s own output on X often reflected the more congenial side of the platform and contained earnest retweets of celebrity birthdays or events. The CEO was often forced back into damage control mode, however, including denyingreports from the Wall Street Journalearlier this year that X had strong-armed companies to advertise on the platform by threatening lawsuits against them. Under Yaccarino, the company didsue advertiserswho had pulled back their spending after Musk’s acquisition and outbursts.The platform’s issues continued right up until Yaccarino announced her departure. The day before she stepped down, Musk’s Grok chatbot began to post rape fantasies, endorsements of Nazi ideology and identify itself as “MechaHitler” beforethe company intervenedand X took down the posts, apologizing for the “inappropriate” tweets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His political alliance with Donald Trump, which began during the 2024 campaign and resulted in Musk’s appointment as a special government employee and the creation of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, imploded in June in full public view. The two men clashed over the US president’s sweeping tax bill, which Musk called an “abomination”. The tech tycoon has committed to starting an independent political party dedicated to ousting Republican members from Congress who voted for the bill, which successfully passed. Meanwhile, Tesla, the source of the majority of Musk’s wealth, has seen its sales fall precipitously in response to his political activities, with prospective buyers and current owners alike shying away from the controversial CEO. SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, has struggled with its latest rocket, the massive Starship, which has repeatedly exploded after liftoff.Explore more on these topicsXElon MusknewsShareReuse this content"

Nvidia’s chips and associated software are considered world leaders for building artificial intelligence products.Nvidia achieved a $1tn market value for the first time back in June 2023 and the surge continued unabated with its market value – the total value of its shares – more than tripling in about a year, faster than Apple andMicrosoft, the only other US firms with a market value of more than $3tn. Apple was the first company to reach a valuation of $3tn, back in 2022.Microsoft is the second-biggest US company, with a market value of about $3.75tn. Nvidia’s value is equivalent to 7.3% of the entire S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark share index.Appleand Microsoft, account for about 7% and 6%, respectively.Nvidia has rebounded about 74% from its April lows, when global markets were jolted by Donald Trump’s tariff volley. US export controls forbid Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China, a restriction the company has pushed back on.However, optimism around trade partners reaching deals with the US have lifted stocks of late, with the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high.Daniel Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush, predicted that more big tech giants will come to join Nvidia in the $4tn market club. “The poster children for the AI revolution are led by Nvidia and Microsoft as both are foundational pieces of building on the biggest tech trend we have seen in our 25 years covering tech stocks on the Street,” he said.Microsoft will hit $4tn “this summer”, Ives said, “and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5tn … as this tech bull market is still early being led by the AI revolution.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He is undocumented, and did not provide his full name.WhenDonald Trumpreturned to office in January, Rogelio said his employers cut their rates by 30% to 40%. Other laborers told him they had endured similar treatment.At Home Depot, Ice raids terrorize the workers who helped build LA: ‘They just come and grab you’Read more“They decreased the pay by piece because they know most of the tile setters don’t have social security numbers, so they take advantage of that. We are in their hands,” Rogelio told the Guardian. “It’s more work, less pay. We have no choice right now.“We’re struggling with bills. We’re struggling with food. We’re struggling with everything because we don’t get enough money to pay whatever we need to pay.”Many of the undocumented immigrants Rogelio knows are only leaving home to work, Rogelio said. “We have a lot of fear,” he told the Guardian. “We look for news in the morning to see if we’re able to go to work or not.”With approximately 2.9 million US construction workers –about 34% of the workforce– foreign-born, construction sector lobbyists have publicly urged the Trump administration to soften their hardline stance on immigration. “While the need for safe and secure borders is paramount, mass deportation is not the answer,” Buddy Hughes, chairperson of the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement.Advocates for workers rights say some operators in the sector are using Trump’s crackdown to abuse undocumented workers.“Especially in construction, there’re a lot of subcontractors that take advantage of this situation by not paying them the fair wage or not even paying them at all,” said Laura Becerra, movement politics director of the non-profit Workers Defense Project based in Texas.Undocumented workers are unlikely to lodge an official complaint, she added. “Since people don’t want to say anything because they don’t want to be put on the radar, and they’re also getting retaliated against if they do say something.”The administration is pushing ahead with public raids on undocumented immigrant workers. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency is arresting an increasing number of immigrants without any criminal history, according to aGuardian analysis of federal government data.“It’s an attack,” Becerra said. “It’s taking a toll on families, families that need to make ends meet, that are already suffering from low wages and doing work no one wants to do.”In Tucson, undocumented workers are avoiding freeways, according to Rogelio. “Freeways are one of the worst places to drive right now because of all the police and border patrol and they look for mostly hispanic people to stop,” he said. “We are living day by day and not knowing what’s going to happen tomorrow.”In some areas “there are spots where you can work with no problem,” he said. “But others, there are racist people living there and they don’t want us. They want our work, they want cheap labor, but they don’t want us.“We came here because we want to work and provide for our families. The only reason I’m here, personally, I have two kids who are American citizens. I’m not asking for any benefits from the government.”Reports from across the US suggest undocumented workers are facing unprecedented pressure.Savannah Palmira, director of organizing for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades district council 5, which covers workers in states around the Pacific north-west, said the threat of raids is making it harder for workers to organize.A roofing company in Washington was raided by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) earlier this year after workers filed safety complaints, Palmira claimed, with the fear of retaliation stemming from that case spreading to other job sites, and leaving workers reluctant to speak out and file complaints against abusive work practices.“What contractors are doing is taking an opportunity to not be held accountable for their bad practices,” said Palmira. “The more and more people are starting to talk about workers getting taken advantage of, Ice is getting called on them. They’re taking a tool away from us to be able to put bad contractors on notice.”In Washington, another undocumented construction worker – who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation – said many of his coworkers were “thinking about going back to their countries” due to the reality of life in the US.“The last company I worked for took advantage of people in every situation,” he said, from dissuading injured workers from getting medical attention to denying overtime and breaks.“They say, you are undocumented, so they will pay you $10 an hour because you have no work permit,” he added. “And if not, they will tell Ice.”“In Washington state, immigrants make up 25% of the trades workforce in construction. With a consistent labor shortage and demand for housing constantly growing, residential construction needs all the skilled workers available,” a spokesperson for the Building Industry Association of Washington said in an email. “We’ve provided our members withguidance on how to legally employ immigrants, includingverifying the identity and US employment authorizationof all employees. We also generally support improving US Immigration policy to allow responsible and law-abiding undocumented worker a pathway to achieving citizenship.”Arizona Builders Alliance did not respond to multiple requests for comment.On a national level the construction industry has repeatedlywarnedof the negative impacts of immigration raids on what they claim has already been a severe labor shortage in US construction.Asked about contractors allegedly using the ramp up in immigration enforcement to cut pay and increase workloads, the National Association of Home Builders issued a statement from Hughes, its chairperson, which did not directly address the claims.“With the construction industry facing a deficit of more than 200,000 workers, policymakers must consider that any disruption to the labor force would raise housing costs, limit supply and worsen the nation’s housing affordability crisis,” Hughes said. “To address this pressing national issue, NAHB is urging Congress to support meaningful investments in our nation’s education system to encourage students to pursue careers in the skilled trades.“Policymakers should also support sensible immigration policies that preserve and expand existing temporary work visa programs while also creating new market-based visa programs that will accurately match demand with available labor.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsTrump administrationUS immigrationWorkers' rightsWashington stateUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is considered in Whitehall to be giving Google “a foot in the door” as the digitisation of public services accelerates.However, the agreement prompted concerns about the precariousness of UK public data potentially being held on US servers amid the unpredictable leadership of Donald Trump.The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said Google Cloud, which provides databases, machine learning and computing power, had “agreed to work with the UK government in helping public services use advanced tech to shake off decades old ‘ball and chain’ legacy contracts which leave essential services vulnerable to cyber-attack”.Google’s services are considered more agile and efficient than traditional competitors, but there are concerns in Whitehall’s digital circles about the government becoming locked into a new kind of dependency.Other US tech firms including Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic have also been providing services to civil servants as they attempt to harness technology to boost the efficiency of cash-strapped public services.On Wednesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, met two of Mark Zuckerberg’s most senior lieutenants, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, and the head of its global business group, Nicola Mendelsohn.During the pandemic in 2020, Palantir, a tech firm founded by the libertarian Trump donor Peter Thiel, provided services to the UK government for £1 and in 2023 it won a £330m dealto create a single platform for NHS data.DSIT also said Google DeepMind, the tech company’s AI division, which is led by the Nobel prize-winning scientist Demis Hassabis, would “collaborate with technical experts in government to support them in deploying and diffusing new emerging technologies, driving efficiencies across the public sector, including accelerating scientific discovery”.But with ministers and government regulators facing pressing decisions on how to regulate AI, search, cloud computing and copyright, Martha Dark, the co-executive director of Foxglove, a non-profit organisation campaigning for fairer use of technology, said: “How is the government going to be able to hold Trump-supporting US big tech giants to any kind of serious account on this – or any other issue – after we’ve given Google the keys to the data kingdom? It’s hard to see this as anything other than dangerously naive on the part of Peter Kyle [the science and technology secretary] and government as a whole.”Other experts said the agreement could “entrench the market power” of a company such as Google and leave the UK government reliant on the technology from giant firms. Kyle, who announced the deal at a Google event in London on Wednesday, said “wherever possible, UK technology companies – large and small – [will] get a fair shot” at winning public tech contracts.The opportunity secured by Google was not put out to public tender as no money was changing hands, a government source said. DSIT said: “These arrangements will operate in full compliance with all applicable public procurement laws, and may be subject to future commercial agreements.”Kyle has held 11 meetings with representatives of Google since Labour took office, according to departmental registers up to the end of March.The government said the agreement does not grant permission for Google to train AI models on government data or access the data for other purposes. It also said data could only be stored overseas when satisfactory legal and security measures were in place.Google said it offered clients control of where their content was stored and processed, including in partnerships with independent infrastructure providers or through “air-gapped” systems that provide an extra layer of protection.Kyle has said he wants to “exploit the full potential of a partnership between government and Google, with much more collaboration between their UK AI lab, DeepMind, and my own AI developers”.There have been signs of new technology delivering efficiencies in the public sector. A recent trial of Microsoft’s AI Copilot tool, provided with a discount, by 20,000 civil servants found it saved them 26 minutes a day on average, according to a governmentstudy, and 82% said they did not want to return to previous working practices.But Imogen Parker, an associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute, a research body focused on ensuring technology works for society, said the deal raised questions about the UK’s digital sovereignty.“The public needs to understand what Google is getting from this partnership and what the return will be for taxpayers in years to come,” she said. “Deals like this might look like good value for money today, but they risk lock-in tomorrow – limiting our ability to seek alternatives in future.”Kyle has previously been accusedof being too close to big tech, and he opened his speech by saying he pleaded guilty to the “crime“ of meeting tech executives far more than his predecessor, after it was reported by the Guardian.“I make absolutely no apologies for meeting with technology companies – that’s the job,” he said, adding that it was important for keeping children safe on social media, making sure Britain was prepared for developments at the frontier of AI, and securing better deals for the taxpayer for the billions of pounds spent every year on technology.Explore more on these topicsGoogleArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingCivil serviceData protectionAlphabetnewsShareReuse this content"

The team that went to Munich and putfive past Inter, the biggest winning margin in a European Cup final, came to New York and scored four against the game’s greatest aristocrats to take them to the final of the Club World Cup against Chelsea.PSG 4-0 Real Madrid: Club World Cup semi-final – as it happenedRead moreIf PSG had not scored more, it was because they did not need to. Three came inside half an hour here, two from Fabián Ruiz either side of another from Ousmane Dembélé; the fourth, scored by Gonçalo Ramos was an adornment added in the 87th minute, the ease with which it was scored eloquent. Madrid were not just defeated at the MetLife Stadium; they were destroyed, taken apart and never given the chance to compete.Under a new manager, their time may come, the absences of Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen did not help, nor did the shift in formation with the return of Mbappé, and Xabi Alonso reflected on the errors that exposed them. But this went deeper; it is PSG’s time now.This is some machine, all right. Unstoppable, the sense of superiority just overwhelming from start to … well, not finish exactly, if only because the real finish came so early.By the time Ruiz gave them the lead after six minutes, it was the fourth clear chance they had, Madrid overrun already. First, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia hit the side-netting; then Thibaut Courtois made two incredible stops, suggesting this might be another of those days when the bullets could fly, everyone unloading on him, and he would still be standing there undefeated at the end of it. This time, though, it was not to be. Even he couldn’t stop everything.It did not help that he had been sold out by his centre-backs. So badly, in fact, that the best thing that happened in the sequence that led to the first goal was that PSG scored it. Raúl Asencio allowed a simple control to escape . Suddenly a blue shirt was upon him – now there’s a line that would be repeated, defining much of this – and Dembélé took the ball from him, right in front of goal. Courtois took Dembélé down, committing what would have been a penalty and possibly a red card had Ruiz not been on hand to sidefoot into the empty net.View image in fullscreenGonçalo Ramos (second right) scores PSG’s fourth goal in the 87th minute.Photograph: Charly Triballeau/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was Antonio Rüdiger’s turn next, swiping at and missing the ball. Again, Dembélé was on to him in a flash. Racing through, he guided past Courtois. Nine minutes in and this was done. Not just because of the goals, although a third followed, but the play, the intensity in PSG and the lack of it from Madrid. The recent evolution under Alonso was nowhere to be seen, optimism evaporating.Yet if Madrid had fallen off a cliff, their opponents had forced them to the edge and helped push them over it too, relentless. Vitinha, Ruiz and João Neves closed every gap as fast as the front three opened them. And the full-backs, Achraf Hakimi and Nuno Mendes … well, calling them full-backs feels utterly inadequate.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Setting off near his area, running 70 yards and playing three passes, he reached the other end and set up Ruiz to roll Federico Valverde and score. Half an hour in, PSG had 78% of the ball, 10 shots and were 3-0 up, as good as through.There was a Kvaratskhelia moment so good it made you laugh, taking it off Mbappé, nutmegging Arda Güler and heading off up the wing. Jude Bellingham had to make a superb recovery tackle but Madrid had been opened again, just as they had a moment earlier when they were grateful for a heavy Désiré Doué touch as he dashed free.And indeed when the referee, Szymon Marciniak, called back another PSG break because Mbappé was down. Courtois made two more saves before the break. At which point, it was all Madrid could aspire to for this to end here.Which it kind of did. Kvaratskhelia and Dembélé were gone by the hour, Ruiz and Doué six minutes later. Between those, Bellingham and Vinícius Júnior made way too. Gigi Donnarumma did not have a save to make, the contest closed. But there at the end were Bradley Barcola and Ramos playing it between them in the Madrid area, the striker turning and adding another for the fun of it, a final little flourish from the machine.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Paris Saint-GermainReal MadridClub World CupUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Thanks to the house settelement signed in May,schools are permittedto spend $20.5m annually across sports, including through expanded scholarships and direct payments (of which it appears football will generally receive approximately 75%). This would seem to mitigate the longstanding problem of exploitation in college football.However, in a sport still defined by extreme injury, recently disclosed provisions in the new Florida State University (FSU) revenue-sharing contract show that schools appear to simply be finding new ways to extract value from players, as ever at startling personal cost.Per aCBS Sportsreport, the new FSU contract being distributed to football players reads, in part, “the following circumstances create a breach of contract by Student-Athlete: Student-Athlete experiences any illness or injury which is serious enough to affect the value of the rights granted to [school] under this Agreement.”In other words: If a player gets injured, the school has leverage to cancel the deal.Why female athletes are challenging the NCAA’s $2.8bn settlementRead moreDarren Heitner, adjunct law professor at the University of Florida and University of Miami, and an expert on college sports’ name, image and likeness (NIL) deals, was stunned by what he found upon reading the contracts.“I take no issue with the drafter of a contract creating a document that leans in favor of the drafting party. In fact, that’s expected,” he told us. “However, there is a problem with a contract when it is so unfair, one-sided, and oppressive that it shocks the conscience.“Reviewing the terms and considering that sometimes 17-year-olds with no legal counsel will be asked to sign on the dotted line, my takeaway is that this rises to the level of unconscionability unless thoroughly negotiated. I have reviewed dozens of revenue-sharing agreements and none compare.”In a statement given to CBS Sports, FSU said in part that “Each individual situation will be unique and the hypotheticals are impossible to predict. However, we are committed to continuing to provide an elite experience for our student-athletes in all aspects of their collegiate career.”Injury, of course, is an inherent feature of college football. In ourrecent bookThe End of College Football: On the Human Cost of an All-American Game we observe that every 2.6 years of participation in football doubles the chances of contracting the degenerative brain disorder chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and that 91 percent of American college football players’ brains examined in a pivotal Boston University study displayed neuropathology consistent with CTE. Similarly, participation in football likely increases the chances of developing Parkinson’s disease by 61 percent compared to athletes in other organized sports (and that risk is 2.93 times greater at the college/pro level).In the book, we interviewed twenty-five former big-time college football players about their experiences in the sport. Many of those players suffered extremely debilitating injuries that caused them to lose seasons or even end careers, including knee reconstructions, torn AC joints, neck surgeries, torn achilles tendons, and countless concussions.‘We were powerless’: inside the devastating Ohio State sexual abuse scandalRead moreOne player told us, “Before I got to college, never had an injury. By the time I left college, I had a medical record book of over six hundred pages. From rehab notes, surgery notes, to MRIs. I had over twelve MRIs total, five knee surgeries. This was while I was playing. . . . Later I found out that I had four torn labrum[s]. So I have a torn labrum on both shoulders, torn labrum on both hips.”Thus, the question of players being relieved of their contractually agreed upon compensation as a consequence of injury is hardly academic. Itwillhappen, and to many.“I think the recently revealed contract details from Florida State exemplifies the current attitude of university officials who have completely lost sight of their jobs as educators,” former UCLA and NFL player Chris Kluwe told us. “They view college athletes (and students) as a product to be bought and sold and not human beings, which runs contrary to everything the education system should be.“In a sport like football where athletes are predominately black and in a state like Florida where the current government seems intent on returning to the Antebellum Era, the fact school officials feel the need to include severe language curtailing players’ rights to the product of their labor is intensely concerning, and highlights the need for a college players union to protect athletes from would-be modern day plantation owners.”The situation is compounded by the fact that universities don’t provide long-term health insurance to the players, leaving them to bear all the associated costs of their physical hardship. One player we spoke to for the book actually told us that “Long term, just strictly financially … it will have [ended up], like I paid money to play college football.”Until such time as there are genuine occupational health and safety protections befitting a profession with such profound inherent dangers, it’s clear that the sport is not actually entering a more humane era. The House Settlement has ushered in little more than a new modality for the same old exploitation and harm.Nathan Kalman-Lamb is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of New Brunswick and co-author ofThe End of College Football: On the Human Cost of an All-American Game.

But he was given a scare by the punchy young Italian Flavio Cobolli, as well as a nasty fall on match point, before coming through a pulsating quarter-final to win 6-7 (8), 6-2, 7-5, 6-4.Djokovic’s reward is a record 14thWimbledonsemi-final, one ahead of Roger Federer, and a meeting with the world No 1, Jannik Sinner, on Friday. It is a battle he is clearly relishing.Sinner eases past Shelton in straight sets to seal Wimbledon semi-final spotRead more“It motivates me to see how much I can still keep going with these guys toe to toe,” he said. “For me, this is what actually counts the most. Being in the last stages of grand slams and playing against the best player in the world right now. And Jannik and Carlos Alcaraz are the leaders of men’s tennis today.”Djokovic hit 39 winners and made just 22 errors against Cobolli, and reached shots that would have flown past lesser opponents. But he admits that Sinner, and potentially Alcaraz in the final, will prove a far tougher physical test.“I am pleased with the way I’m playing,” Djokovic said. “Physically I hope that I’ll be able to sustain that. That’s more of a concern than game‑wise. I think game-wise the way I’m feeling the ball when I’m fit and ready, I feel like I can go toe to toe with those guys and even beat them if I’m playing my best.”Beforehand the tale of the tape was so overwhelmingly in Djokovic’s favour that few gave Cobolli a shot. The Italian, after all, came into this match with a 1-11 record against the world’s top 10. His career record on grass stood at a modest nine wins and six defeats. And he was up against the greatest of all time, the seven-time champion here, and someone who had thrashed him 6-1, 6-2 in their only meeting.But this was a different Cobolli, one determined to roll the dice and with the confidence to believe he could provide the biggest shock of Wimbledon this year.In the last 16, Alex de Minaur had tried to defeat Djokovic by mixing deft spins and devilish unpredictability, and using the swirling wind as his friend. Cobolli’s approach was more blunt. He simply wanted to blast Djokovic off the court. It nearly worked, too.Djokovic said: “He played at a really high level. And at some parts of the match he was just serving so good that I wasn’t able to read or attack it.”View image in fullscreenFlavio Cobolli looks skywards during his quarter-final against Novak Djokovic.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianInitially the Italian looked to be feeling the pressure of his first grand slam quarter-final. His first shot – a return of serve – scooted into the net. And his second was a mis-hit.But Cobolli was determined to hit himself out of trouble. Serves were thundered down at more than 130mph, forehands were struck flat and hard, and he kept digging himself out of potential potholes.It said everything about the Italian’s game that even when down 5-3 in the first set, he broke back immediately and then took it on a tie‑break after a 137mph serve.Perhaps understandably, given this was his first time on Centre Court and he was playing his idol, Cobolli then had a wobble. From 2-1 up in the second set, he lost seven games in a row. In truth, it looked over.From nowhere, however, Cobolli’s radar suddenly started working again. At 2-0 down in the third set he broke back and led 5-4 before nerves got the better of him.Still the Italian kept fighting. But at 4-4 and 30-30 in the fourth set, the tension became too much. A double-handed backhand went halfway up the net before a drop volley was fluffed.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic fans cheer their man on during his quarter-final against Flavio Cobolli.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt left Djokovic serving for the match. But there was still time for more drama as, on the second match point, the Serb fell face first on to the grass after another Cobolli winner flashed past him and he appeared to hurt his hip.“It was a nasty fall,” Djokovic said. “It was very awkward. That happens on the grass. I’ve had quite a few of those throughout my grass court career.“Obviously, my body is not the same today like it was before, so I guess the real impact of what happened I will feel tomorrow. So let’s see. I’m hoping the next 24-48 hours that the severity is not too bad, that I’ll be able to play at my best and be free of pain in two days.”After the fall it took him a while to get up. Yet two points later, his hands were pointing skyward in triumph. Djokovic continues to confound expectations. Against Sinner he will have to do so again.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Novak DjokovicWimbledonTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

It carries an import that will be felt right across the sport, a significance in how it played out and what happens next as the team Horner built and led to such enormous success faces an uncertain future.Horner has been at Red Bull since the team was formed in 2005 from the ashes of Jaguar, a team in no little disarray when Red Bull bought it. Horner was at the helm as it was transformed from an operation of 450 personnel, without so much as a win to their name, to one of 1,500 today that haswon eight drivers’ titlesand six constructors’ championships, and is one of the most extraordinary success stories in F1 history.Christian Horner sacked by Red Bull after 20 years as principal at F1 teamRead moreHorner has never shied away from publicity and has revelled in the role of disruptor, embracing the brickbats his team received for being backed by an energy drink manufacturer, rather than a grand old motor racing marque.“We are different atRed Bull. You won’t see anyone in a suit and tie here, it’s more jeans and T-shirt,” he said of the culture he engendered. “We don’t conform, we call it as we see it and we are not afraid to have an opinion.”That approach did not endear him to some in the paddock but, when allied to his acute sense that F1 was about bringing in the right people and enabling them to work in the best possible way, it returned huge success.Yet in the space of under two years – a bagatelle in F1 terms – so much has unravelled at Red Bull. Seventeen months ago as the team entered 2024 with their world champion Max Verstappen on a roll with three consecutive titles, Horner wasaccused of inappropriate behaviourby a female colleague.Horner always denied any wrongdoing and was subsequently exonerated by an independent investigation and despite what were purported to be leaked text messages between Horner and the employee, he has been supported by his wife, the former Spice Girl Geri Horner, throughout.However, as the controversy roiled it reflected yawning divisions within the team. Not least an internal power struggle between Horner and parent company, Red Bull GmbH, and between Horner and Verstappen’s father, the former F1 driver Jos Verstappen, who was openly calling for him to be sacked.The team’s longstanding motorsport advisor Helmut Marko, a friend to the Verstappens, was at one point under threat of suspension, prompting Verstappen in turn to threaten to leave. By F1 standards this was turmoil.View image in fullscreenChristian Horner has been involved in an internal power struggle with Max Verstappen (left) and his father Jos in recent times.Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/EPAHorner’s position looked to be hanging by a thread. Yet he rode it out and Red Bull GmbH backed off as the furore around the allegations died down and Horner still enjoyed the backing of Chalerm Yoovidhya, the Thai businessman who owns a 51% share of the company.At theBritish Grand Prix last weekendit was business as usual, with no inkling that Yoovidhya apparently must have changed his stance and the parent company were preparing to act. At the heart of the decision it is impossible not to consider that Verstappen, a once in a generation talent, has been the key piece around which all other manoeuvring has occurred.The world champion has repeatedly expressed his desire only for there to be calm and a focus directed solely on the performance of his car. He has been disappointed on both fronts.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionOver the past two years Red Bull have lost key personnel, not least Rob Marshall as chief engineering officer followed, crucially, byAdrian Newey, the team’s genius designer, considered to be the best of his generation, who joined Aston Martin, and then Jonathan Wheatley, the sporting director.Amid all of this the car’s performance fell away too. Last year only Verstappen’s fierce determination and an early season lead were enough to see him over the line. This season, Red Bull have been well and truly surpassed by McLaren. Verstappen’s shot at the title has already gone, while Red Bull’s second driver, Yuki Tsunoda, often struggles to so much as score points.Verstappen has been clearly dissatisfied and while under contract until 2028 other teams are already looking to lure him away, not least Mercedes with whom he has been in talks.Red Bull’s decision to remove Horner may well constitute an effort to keep him on board, to placate Verstappen and his father in the face of Mercedes’ advances, or indeed, as has been posited, that Verstappen has already done a deal and Horner is paying the price.For Verstappen it is a relatively simple equation, he wants to be in the best car and will be considering his options on that basis. Next season major regulation changes will put a focus on new engines, where it is believed Mercedes have already stolen a march, while Red Bull have committed for the first time in their history to building their own engines, a hugely complex and demanding undertaking with no guarantee of success, with rumours suggesting they are behind the curve.Which leaves Red Bull, a once formidable force, with a woeful car, in danger of losing their talismanic driver, set to enter another new era without the man who had brought them so far and in a vortex of instability. As the once mighty Williams team discovered, success is never guaranteed in F1 and Red Bull too now might consider themselves on a knife edge.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneChristian HornerRed BullMotor sportanalysisShareReuse this content"

I was not expecting to be so far ahead of him in this time trial. I expected him to be closer to Remco, but maybe he didn’t have a great day.”While the Olympic and world time trial champion Evenepoel, riding at an average speed of 54km/h, claimed an expected stage success, Pogacar was the real winner, as Vingegaard’s challenge wilted in the heat of the Calvados afternoon.With Vingegaard now under pressure to combat his rival, there may be further tension in the camp, with his American teammate Matteo Jorgenson, winner of the Paris-Nice race in March, just nine seconds behind him.“I don’t have an explanation,” Visma’s head of racing, Grischa Niermann, said of his team leader’s result. “Of course, we hoped for more. I guess Jonas didn’t have enough power today.”Pogacar, however, was not getting carried away. “I always have eyes on everybody, not just one guy,” he said. “You cannot discount all the riders up to top 10 in general classification.View image in fullscreenRemco Evenepoel powers his way towards a time trial victory.Photograph: Dario Belingheri/Getty Images“Jonas is the most hungry to get back time, he’s in super good shape, his team’s in good form, so they will try, maybe tomorrow or the next day.”Yet there is no doubt the pendulum has now swung in Pogacar’s favour. Evenepoel, winner of the 2024 Tour time trial stage to Gevrey‑Chambertin, had predicted he would make up almost a minute on Pogacar and, quickly into his compact position, set off at breakneck pace. Despite winning the stage, the Belgian did not achieve the time gains for which he had hoped.The Slovenian, blindsided by a flying Evenepoel in the Critérium du Dauphiné time trial a month ago, was this time a different prospect. His performance around Caen was much more competitive than expected and kept the Belgian in check, while transforming a slim overnight advantage over Vingegaard of 8sec into a significant 1min 13sec.But on a stage thankfully free of any of the pile-ups that have marked some of the earlier stages, the safety debate still shadowed the peloton, after the Canadian rider Mike Woods, 122nd overall in the Tour, said that race organisers ASO “love crashes”.Writing on his blog, the 38 year old Woods, a stage winner in the 2023 Tour, said: “Despite their claimed attempts to make the sport safer, one gets a sense – when watching any highlight reel they create – that blood, broken bikes, and some poor bastard walking into an ambulance are what they love to sell.”View image in fullscreenAll eyes on Tadej Pogacar on stage five.Photograph: Loïc Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesAnother casualty of earlier crashes, Emilien Jeannniere of France, who was catapulted into the crowd barriers in the stage to Dunkirk on Monday, quit the race after it was discovered that he had broken his shoulder, even though he successfully finished stage four into Rouen.“It’s sad to abandon my first Tour, but there are other races and I have to put my health first,” the 26 year old rider said.Others are faring better, with the rising British talents Oscar Onley and the Tour debutant Joe Blackmore quickly finding their feet in this year’s race. In contrast, prospects looked gloomier for Ineos Grenadiers with Carlos Rodriguez now languishing in 16th place, four minutes behind Pogacar, after the first time trial.The sixth stage on Thursday, from Bayeux to Vire, includes six categorised climbs and may see more sparring at the uphill finish, on the 14% slopes of the Avenue d’Atlacomulco.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarTour de FranceCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Lionesses will be guaranteed a place in the quarter‑finals if they defeat Wales in St Gallen on Sunday.England turn up the volume and drown out doubts against Netherlands | Nick AmesRead more“I think ‘proper English’ to us means: ‘We’ll work hard, we’ll work until we can’t run any more. We’ll stick together,’” Russo said, after being named as Uefa’s player of the match. “And we know we’re very dominant on the ball as well. Returning to that, that’s our standard, and that’s our DNA as a team, and we definitely saw that today, from the first minute right until the end. Everyone was working so hard.“We were really dominant on first and second balls, and clinical with our chances. We probably could have scored even more as well. It was definitely something that we wanted, to return to our roots, and we know we’re capable of performances like that.” When England hit such standards, she said, “the sky’s the limit”.Sarina Wiegman said the “proper England” phrase had been coined by her players since they responded to a disappointing draw with Portugal in February by beating the world champions Spain at Wembley in their next game. After her team again demonstrated their ability to bounce back strongly, the head coach said: “The players use that [phrase] a lot now. [It’s about] togetherness and the fight. But at the same time, when you’re in possession, for me it’s important that the passes we play are with purpose, and today you really saw the purpose in every pass we played, and for me that’s also ‘proper English’.”The England right-back Lucy Bronze praised her fellow defenders Jess Carter and Alex Greenwood for epitomising the idea, saying: “Alex [Greenwood] was front-footed, she was aggressive. Jess Carter was completely covering her every single minute of the game as well. You put in the hard work to make sure you’re doing a job for the team and that your teammate has got your back. Those two really embodied that and gave a lot of the rest of the team confidence.”The Netherlands head coach, Andries Jonker, admitted England’s performance took his side by surprise. “It is a heavy defeat and we didn’t see it coming, we thought we would be able to compete with England,” he said. “It was a surprise. I bear the responsibility. We were convinced this game plan would work out but unfortunately it didn’t.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that would be very wrong.An admittedly emphatic scoreline that leaves France top of Group D and imperiously on course for the quarter-finals does not tell the whole story of a much improved Wales performance on a night when Jess Fishlock scored a historic goal.France 4-1 Wales: Women’s Euro 2025 – live reactionRead moreGranted, only highly improbable mathematics dictate that their impending tournament exit is not quite rubber-stamped but Rhian Wilkinson’s players made Laurent Bonadei’s gifted side work hard for a convincing win.Wales arrived at the St Gallen Arena in a new team bus with a fresh driver at the wheel. Wilkinson’s squad were badly shaken when their original coach was involved in a collision with a car en route to a training session on Tuesday afternoon but her switch to a back four amid a quartet of personnel changes was all about tactical choice.In contrast Bonadei’s decision to rotate so heavily that the France starting XI contained only four survivors from the2-1 win against Englandlast Saturday reflected a desire to keep his stars well rested.Having analysed theNetherlands’ opening 3-0 victoryagainst Wales the France coach clearly felt sufficiently confident to rest seven key players including two outstanding forwards in Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Sandy Baltimore.If that bolstered the morale of the travelling Red Wall, aka near 2,000 travelling Wales supporters, so, too, did the replacement of the rain that soaked St Gallen in recent days with tepid evening sunshine.View image in fullscreenSafia Middleton-Patel cannot get near Amel Majri’s third goal for France.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersYet as dusk descended, a slight chill permeated the air. Wales looked in peril of freezing as France began in menacing mode with Manchester United’s Safia Middleton-Patel, who had replaced Olivia Clark in goal, quickly forced to save from the impressive Clara Matéo with her legs.When the otherwise indomitable Angharad James-Turner failed to clear a corner, the ball fell for Matéo to chest down and volley expertly beyond Middleton-Patel.Undeterred, Fishlock – who else? – responded by conjuring the moment for which Wales waited so long; their first goal at their inaugural major tournament.Despite being tackled, Ceri Holland somehow managed to dink the ball into Fishlock’s path and Wales’s 38-year-old record goalscorer needed no invitation to direct it into the back of the net.Although an offside flag paused ecstatic celebrations they resumed once VAR came to the rescue and it was decided Fishlock’s goal stood after all. The Seattle Reign midfielder, who made her Wales debut almost two decades ago, became the oldest player to score at a women’s European Championship and immediately raced towards a suddenly tearful Wilkinson.“What a moment,” Fishlock said later. “I’m extremely proud of the girls tonight; for most of it we were in the game but we need to be better in little moments.”Her goal relaxed Wales to the point where they remembered they can actually play a bit. So much so that Bonadei’s youthful backline lost their way for a while.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Kadidiatou Diani converted from the spot, somewhat fortuitously after her fancy run-up produced the tamest of kicks straight down the middle. Yet although Middleton-Patel, diving to her right, got a foot to it she could only divert the ball into her own net, leaving it to trickle over the line.That setback apart, Wilkinson’s smart decision to play a formation that swiftly morphed into a brave version of 4-4-2 discomfited France for long periods.Significantly only an awful error from Middleton-Patel, who dithered over a clearance, enabled Matéo to steal possession before passing sublimely for Amel Majri to lash home. In mitigation, the goalkeeper is only 20 and generally her footwork is very good.Now, though, her inexperience showed and, when she misread Diani’s cross, Grace Geyoro applied the finishing close-range touch.As French fans dared to dream of a first major tournament triumph, Fishlock thanked the Red Wall. “They were loud and proud,” she said. “We have the best fans in the world.”“I’m very proud of that performance against very strong opposition,” said Wilkinson. “I truly believe France are one of the top three teams in the world. Yes, we lost 4-1 but we showed up and were courageous against one of the world’s best teams. It’s not always about the result. It’s fine margins but we’ve shown everyone how proud we are to represent Wales.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025France women's football teamWales women's football teamWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Lyon, who are owned by John Textor’s Eagle Football Holdings, have earned a reprieve after an appeal hearing in Paris on Wednesday and are expected to take up their place in next season’sEuropa Leagueafter finishing sixth last season.The French football federation said in a statement that the decision by the DNCG’s appeal commission “invalidates the administrative relegation” and allowed for Lyon’s wage bill and transfer spend to be monitored.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Menu button at the bottom right, then go to Settings (the gear icon), then Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.That is likely to have a major ramifications on Uefa’s decision on whether Palace, who qualified for the Europa League bywinning the FA Cup, will be cleared to participate in Europe after a ruling was delayed last week pending the outcome of Lyon’s appeal.Clubs are barred from competing in the same Uefa competition if an individual or ownership group is considered to have a decisive influence over more than one of those teams. Textor remains Palace’s largest shareholder but the US businessman recentlyagreed a deal to sell his Palace sharesto the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson. The former US ambassador to the UK must pass the Premier League’s owners’ and directors’ test before he can complete the purchase but it is understood that is nearing completion.Uefa sources have indicated that its Club Financial Control Body , which investigates alleged breaches of its multi-club ownership rules, is due to decide on Palace’s fate this week. With Lyon, who were fined €12.5m (£10.8m) byUefafor a breach of financial sustainability requirements last week, having been cleared by Uefa to play in European competition if they were reinstated to France’s top flight, Palace’s prospects of joining Aston Villa as the Premier League’s representatives in the competition won by Tottenham last season appear slim.There is a chance that they could be demoted to the Conference League, with Nottingham Forest taking Palace’s place in the Europa League.Palace, who have never played in a major European competition, are expected to appeal to the court of arbitration for sport if they are barred from the Europa League. Last monthUefa rejected attemptsfrom Textor and his Palace co-owner David Blitzer, the majority shareholder at Danish side Brøndby, to put their shares in a blind trust after they missed the 1 March deadline.Textor announced last week that he had resigned from his leadership roles at Lyon, with Michael Gerlinger appointed as the chief executive and Michele Kang – who owns Washington Spirit and London City Lionesses and bought Lyon’s extremely successful women’s team from Eagle Football Holdings last year – as the chair and president. She is understood to have led Lyon’s appeal, with reports in France saying the club have agreed on an “austerity plan” designed to stabilise its finances after being asked to inject up to €200m to keep the club inLigue 1.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liverpool finished seventh of 12 in the WSL table.Taylor was aWomen’s FA Cup winnerwith Manchester City in 2020 and also led them tothe League Cup in 2022, before a second-placed finish in the league in 2024. The 52-year-old had previously coached within Manchester City’s academy.The former Wales striker spent just under five years at the helm at Manchester City, before beingsacked in March, just days before this year’s League Cup final. During his playing career, he represented a range of clubs including Sheffield United, Nottingham Forest and Manchester City.Liverpool are two-time former WSL winners, having lifted the title twice in succession during Beard’s first spell in charge of the club in 2013 and 2014, but they have not challenged for the title for a decade. They were relegated down to the second tier in 2020 but won promotion back to the top flight under Beard in 2022 and secured an impressive fourth-placed finish in 2024, and they were FA Cup quarter-finalists in that same year.The Merseyside club were not the only WSL side searching for a new head coach this summer.

The Ghana attacker will become the first player to leave West Ham for Spurs since Scott Parker in 2011.Transfer latest: Arsenal open Madueke talks with Chelsea, Everton sign £27m striker BarryRead moreWest Ham’s decision to sell Kudus to their London rivals is down to their needing to revamp their squad without inviting a potential breach of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regulations. Sources at the London Stadium are adamant thatWest Ham must sell to buy. They want a goalkeeper, a left centre-back, a left wing-back, at least two midfielders and a striker.Kudus had an £85m release clause valid forPremier Leaguesides for the first 10 days of July but West Ham were always likely to accept a lower fee. He was deemed the club’s most sellable asset and has attracted plenty of interest. Spurs have made the strongest push for the 24-year-old and had a £50m bid rejected last week. The payment is to be spread over three years.West Ham are comfortable with allowing Kudus to leave, reasoning that he is best playing on the right – the same position as the captain, Jarrod Bowen. Graham Potter does not feel that Kudus is capable of playing in a central role in the Premier League. It is understood Kudus was twice late for training this week and had requested a transfer.Kudus impressed after joining West Ham from Ajax for £37m two years ago but struggled last season. He clashed with Potter’s predecessor, Julen Lopetegui, and managed four goals in all competitions. He served a lengthy ban after a red card duringa 4-1 defeat by Spurslast October.That dismissal has not stopped Tottenham from going for him. Kudus will boost Thomas Frank’s options in the final third and his arrival represents a show of intent as Spurs look to rebuild after replacing Ange Postecoglou with the Dane.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowTottenham HotspurWest Ham UnitedPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

He was cleared of the 2015 charge.Despite the custodial penalty, the Italian manager will not spend any time behind bars as non-violent, first-time offenders given sentences of less than two years are rarely sent to prison under Spanish law.Ancelotti, the most successful manager in Champions League history, is the latest high-profile football figure to find himself pursued in recent years by Spain’s tax authorities. In July 2016 Lionel Messi and his father, Jorge, weresentenced to 21 months in prisonfor evading tax on Lionel’s image rights during his time at Barcelona, with more than €4m owed in back payments.Six years agoCristiano Ronaldo admitted committing tax fraudwhile playing for Real Madrid and agreed to pay an €18.8m fine after striking a deal with prosecutors and tax authorities in return for a 23-month suspended prison sentence. In February 2019José Mourinho was given a one-year suspended prison sentenceand agreed to pay €2.2m in fines after admitting tax fraud while he was the manager of Real Madrid.The following year, the Atlético Madrid forwardDiego Costa paid a fine of €543,208after pleading guilty to defrauding the tax authorities of more than €1m by not declaring payments of more than €5.15m from his 2014 move to Chelsea.Explore more on these topicsCarlo AncelottiReal MadridSpainnewsShareReuse this content"

With its former leaderrecently involved in (and acquitted from) a corruption case, and accusations of the current president pursuing“private interests”over his responsibilities, what better place for Fifa to shake off the image as a cash-chasing, power-hungry behemoth than in the actual residence of the current USA president?“Fifa [is] a global organisation [and] to be global you have to be local, you have to be everywhere, so we have to be in New York,” Infantino said, ignoring that after the opening of an office in Miami last year that had absolutely nothing to do with the recent signing of Lionel Messi in the city, Fifa now has more offices in the US than it does in the entirety of either South America or the Far East. “Not just for the FifaClub World Cupthis year and the Fifa World Cup next year – we have to be in New York as well when it comes to where our offices are based.”Head of football in Republic of the Congo accused of embezzling $1.3m of Fifa fundsRead moreGianni and co do have a men’s World Cup to prepare for in a year’s time, although Football Daily does not recall Fifa opening any offices in any of the previous host World Cup nations – Qatar or Russia – since Infantino was elected in 2015. But Trump Tower is a special place: four gold-painted elevators and 240 tons of Breccia Pernice pink white-veined marble adorn the skyscraper’s lobby and public spaces, plus the in-house restaurant, Trump Grill, was once labelled by Vanity Fair as perhaps“the worst restaurant in America”.Fifa offices have always been a bit quirky, though, and none stranger than their global headquarters in Zurich, a zero-emission building which is mostly underground, with the meeting room for the executive committee hermetically sealed. “Places where people make decisions should only contain indirect light,” said former president Sepp Blatter after the building’s completion in 2006, a devastatingly bad attempt to distance himself from the image of a Bond villain. “Because the light should come from the people themselves who are assembled there.” Sure.President Trump unfortunately chose not to come downstairs into the light of the press conference to open this new office – in fairness, he has got quite a bit on, at the moment – with renowned soccer enthusiast Eric Trump instead shunted out to face the cameras alongside Infantino. “On behalf of myself, on behalf of New York, on behalf of the Trump Organization and everybody that works in this building – we love you. We’re honoured, we’re excited about all the things that Fifa is doing,” trumpeted Eric,with a straight face.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Emillia Hawkins for piping hot Euro 2025 updates ofEngland 2-1 Netherlands at 5pm(all times BST), while Will Unwin will be on hand at 8pm forWales 0-3 France.

Here they put four past Real Madrid with a display so dominant that he had to deny that they had taken their foot off the gas.In doing so, however, the PSG head coach did reveal that he had made changes with Sunday’s final against Chelsea in mind. PSG were two goals up inside 10 minutes and had made it 3-0 before they had played half an hour, the game effectively over, before Gonçalo Ramosadded a fourth in the dying minutes.Mbappé gets stuck in Dembélé’s shadow in Real Madrid’s shapeless shambles | Jacob SteinbergRead moreThe second half had been played out at a reduced pace and PSG made a series of substitutions involving key players with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Fabián Ruiz, Nuno Mendes, Ousmane Dembélé and Désiré Doué all removed. At times it felt like the only thing that prevented them from scoring more was that they did not need to and there was no desire to keep tearing into their opponents.“My phone is full of messages from Barcelona fans, which tells you about how big this game was,”Luis Enriquesaid. “You go at 100% for everything this shirt represents and we know what Real Madrid are, what they were and what they will always be, how great they are. We didn’t put the brakes on but of course with the heat, with the final in three days’ time, with cramp and the risk of tiredness, you act. The first thing is the objective, which is to reach the final and compete. But at no point do you put the brakes on.”View image in fullscreenLuis Enrique soaks up the acclaim after the match.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“This was an objective from the start,” the PSG head coach added. “And now we are just one game away from building PSG’s history, and winning all the trophies we have participated in this season. It means a lot for us, for our fans and it is a pleasure to work at this club. We have scored 100-plus goals and we let in very few. These players are exceptional.” Asked for the key, Luis Enrique said: “The insuperable play of my players and their generosity, the way they give everything at the service of the team.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We are going to dominate, no matter what.”India beat England by six wickets to win fourth women’s T20 and series – as it happenedRead moreEngland sit above India in the InternationalCricketCouncil’s T20 team rankings but the manner of this defeat suggests the rankings have not quite caught up with reality. The home team were outplayed in every department.With the bat, England suffered from a combination of poor shot selection and general muddle-headedness to finish on 126 for seven. India’s fielding was so blisteringly good that England failed to score a single boundary between the 11th and 19th overs.India’s openers, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana, then raced to 53 not out in the powerplay, displaying the controlled aggression which England had so lacked, and laying a secure enough platform that a few overs of sensible batting and strike rotation from Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues enabled the latter to hit the winning runs with three overs to spare.“India have adapted to English conditions better than we expected,” Tammy Beaumont said.“It’s really difficult to defend a score like that when you know they’re going to come out and play freely and get ahead of the game. We stuck at it and did pick up a few wickets, but we never really had enough runs if we’re honest.”View image in fullscreenJemimah Rodrigues leads the celebrations as India reach England’s target.Photograph: Nathan Stirk/ECB/Getty ImagesSophie Ecclestone, playing in her 100th international, took one for 20 in her four overs and held on to a catch at mid-off to see off the Indian captain Kaur. She had earlier broken England’s boundary drought at the death, slogging a six over midwicket to finish unbeaten on 16 from 10. But it was too little, too late in an innings punctuated by regular wickets.Danni Wyatt-Hodge, Beaumont and Paige Scholfield were caught by Arundhati Reddy trying to heave down the ground, while Alice Capsey missed her attempted reverse to Shree Charani, was given out leg-before, and was so unconvinced by her own decision to review that she walked off before the third umpire, Jacqueline Williams, had given her verdict.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But hateful comments had remained online for at least 24 hours.A spokesperson for the All England Club said: “Wimbledon’s social analytics tool automatically rates comments by sentiment and flags posts with a high proportion of negativity.“Our digital team also does a significant amount of manual moderation of comments across all of Wimbledon’s official social channels with the aim of removing inappropriate content as soon as possible.”The former Wimbledon champion and British No 1 Johanna Konta, 34, said the club should be doing more to delete abusive comments on its accounts. “I think obviously they probably do [delete comments], it’s just there’s always going to be a lag. Unless someone is there constantly with their finger on the trigger. It’s tough,” she added.“I highly doubt that Wimbledon are not actively looking to make sure that their site is clean and as devoid of abuse as possible. They’re not looking to abuse their own players that’s for sure, but it’s hard; how do you keep it fully clean?”Wimbledon has an AI-driven social media monitoring service,Threat Matrix, that monitors players’ public-facing social media profiles and automatically flags death threats, racism and sexist comments in 35 different languages. The service is supported by people monitoring the accounts.Wimbledon said on Wednesday that the Threat Matrix had analysed 150,000 posts to date at this year’s championships. “Just under 10,000 posts have been flagged for human review, of which 2,504 have been risk assessed and triaged for further action – which could include reporting accounts to platforms and security/law enforcement escalation where required,” a spokesperson said.Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the charityWomenin Sport, said social media companies should become far stricter in blocking the accounts of those who promote misogyny. “Currently they don’t even list misogyny as a reason for reporting harmful content. There should be a zero-tolerance approach,” she said.“Nor is it appealing to young girls and women to see your heroes subjected to this hate. Seeing this kind of attack is hardly going to inspire you to make it to the top; there is still a dream gap with only 38% of girls dreaming of becoming top athletes, compared to 59% of boys.”Naomi Broady, 35, the former world No 76, said all players received hate but women were subjected to misogynistic abuse.

It came six minutes ahead of schedule, but Real Madrid were grateful for the respite. They wandered to the touchline, dazed and confused, and reached for the water bottles. They looked to Xabi Alonso and hoped for answers. After 24 minutes of being pummelled byParis Saint-Germain, though, the thought occurred that the players in white would have been better off asking for smelling salts.It is never a good sign when the emergency team talk takes place with more than an hour left. PSG had just stormed into a 3-0 lead, Fabián Ruiz scoring his second after a stunning combination between the exceptional Ousmane Dembélé and the flying Achraf Hakimi on the right, and to be honest the scoreline felt kind on Madrid. The New Jersey sun was beating down but PSG were merciless. Lads, it’s 33C. Any chance of slowing down?PSG cruise to Club World Cup final after Ruiz and Dembélé stun Real MadridRead moreThink again. This was the best team in the world giving the most famous team in the world an almighty slapdown. Collectivism outdid individualism during this 4-0 demolition. PSG delighted in the suffering. They had no need to prove there is life after Kylian Mbappé – they did that whenthey won the Champions Leaguewith a stunning final performance against Inter – but they still went ahead and emphasised the point with force, eloquence and no little brilliance.It is partly down to the structure implemented by Luis Enrique. Mentality also comes into it, though. Saying that PSG wanted thisClub World Cupsemi-final more might sound reductive but that does not make it untrue. This is a team shorn of passengers. Dembélé now has 35 goals this season but do not underestimate his work off the ball. Nobody remembers the 28-year-old playing like this for Barcelona. Nobody saw the France forward becoming the ultimate team player when his unhappy spell at Barça came to an end.Luis Enrique has transformed Dembélé. Madrid, by contrast, are kidding people when they try to press. Alonso is trying to introduce a system after replacing the more laissez-faire Carlo Ancelotti, but it is unclear if any system can survive Mbappé. This was his first game against PSG since leaving them under a cloud in 2024 and it did not go well. Doubts over whether Alonso’s Madrid will function properly with Mbappé, Jude Bellingham and Vinícius Júnior in the same team persist. It is notable that Madrid were more fluid with the youngster Gonzalo García leading the line while Mbappé was recovering from a stomach bug. Vinícius and Bellingham both looked happier.Yet Mbappé was always going to come in for his first start of the tournament here. In his head, the narrative demanded that he beat his old side single-handedly, but the reality was harsher. It was hammered home as Mbappé cut inside and prepared to shoot in the 38th minute, only for João Neves to leave him on the turf with a crunching block.Neves does not turn 21 until September. He is a wonderful, intricate midfielder but he plays with a snarl and the beauty for Luis Enrique is that the Portugal international is not alone. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is another one. Look at how the Georgian dispossessed Mbappé on the edge of the PSG area and followed it up with a nutmeg on Arda Güler. There were also plenty of electrifying runs to terrify Fede Valverde, who had the misfortune of filling in at right-back with Trent Alexander-Arnold injured.View image in fullscreenAchraf Hakimi leans over Kylian Mbappé after he was floored by a João Neves challenge.Photograph: Pamela Smith/APMadrid were a shapeless shambles. The defence was a mess, the midfield a void. It was amazing how often PSG’s defenders were able to stride forward and play into feet. There was no resistance. Désiré Doué and Kvaratskhelia had so much space. Vitinha, Neves and Ruiz did as they pleased in the middle. Madrid are paying for their failure to replace Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, who made his final Madrid appearance as a substitute before he moves to Milan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They just get outpassed and overrun. The easy line is that Madrid signed the wrong French forward when they nabbed Mbappé and left Dembélé in Paris. Yet PSG are not about stars. Dembélé’s goal for 2-0 came because he forced Antonio Rüdiger into a comedy error in ninth minute. He had also pressed for the opening goal from Ruiz, taking advantage of a heavy touch from Raúl Asencio.There is beauty to Luis Enrique’s remorseless machine, though. For the third goal, Dembélé dropped deep, the movement subtle as he pulled into space. He played a reverse pass to Hakimi, again surging beyond poor Fran García, and Ruiz did the rest after being found by PSG’s flying right-back.It was so slick. PSG eased off in the second half, saving themselves before facing Chelsea in the final on Sunday, eventually making it 4-0 after Bradley Barcola came on to set up Gonçalo Ramos to fire past Thibaut Courtois. Look what you left behind, Kylian.

After Sinner’s physical struggles in the previous round, all eyes rested on his elbow. He responded to those concerns with a soaring, emphatic performance, neutralising the nuclear Shelton serve as he returned to theWimbledonsemi-finals with an efficient 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4 win.Wimbledon 2025 quarter-finals: Cobolli v Djokovic, Sinner breezes past Shelton – liveRead moreRegardless of his physical concerns or the significant mental challenge of bouncing back from hisdefeat against Carlos Alcarazin the French Open final, Sinner’s consistency is eternal. With this victory, the 23‑year‑old Italian is the 12th player in the open era to reach four consecutive grand slam semi-finals. Every time he steps on to the court, he is such an incredibly difficult player to beat.From the beginning, Sinner looked entirely like himself as he put together a dominant performance, effortlessly taking care of his service games and overwhelming Shelton from the baseline with his relentless weight of shot, depth and consistency. His performance reasserted his status as a top favourite as he pursues his firstWimbledontitle.“I had quite good feelings in the warm-up today,” Sinner said. “So I felt also yesterday that mentally I have to get ready. I put into my mind that I’m going to play today. Yeah, so the concerns were not that big if I would play or not. It was just a matter of what my percentage is. Today was very high, so I’m happy.”View image in fullscreenJannik Sinner (left) embraces Ben Shelton at the net after his emphatic victory.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe buildup to this encounter had been dominated by the events on Monday in Sinner’s remarkablefourth-round win against Grigor Dimitrov. In the opening game, Sinner had slipped awkwardly and landed on his elbow. As he struggled, he was bulldozed for two sets by a supreme Dimitrov and was at serious risk of defeat. While leading 6-3, 7-5, 2-2, Dimitrov abruptly tore his pectoral muscle and was forced to retire. As Dimitrov left the court in tears, Sinner’s thoughts shifted immediately to his own injury. On Tuesday, he underwent a scan but his team chose not to disclose the results.Fifty minutes into this quarter‑final, all doubts were gone. The two shots likely to be affected by a right elbow injury, Sinner’s serve and forehand, were devastating from the start as he shut Shelton out of his service games throughout a high-quality, serve-dominated set. At the end of it, he had struck just one unforced error and lost two points on his serve.With the first set secured, Sinner continued to dominate his service games. In the second and third sets, Sinner threw everything at Shelton when he reached 5-4, landing ample returns, forcing the American into prolonged exchanges and allowing scoreboard pressure to come into play. Both times, he left with the set.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But this match-up was a measure of how far the 22-year-old has to go. Shelton’s strengths are striking – he backs up his monstrous serve with his destructive, versatile forehand, excellent athleticism and a deep toolbox of shots.Against a well-rounded player such as Sinner, though, Shelton’s weaknesses were glaring. That he won just 19% of Sinner’s service points was an indictment of his return. Although he has made significant improvements to his backhand, under pressure from an opponent who hits with such immense pace consistently, the stroke broke down in the prolonged exchanges.Although Shelton outperformed Sinner in short rallies of 0-4 shots, winning 63 of those to 62, he was flattened in the baseline battles. In the mid-length rallies of 5-8 shots, Sinner finished 30-14 and the Italian was even more dominant in rallies of nine or more shots, closing out the match 14-4. Shelton has a long, exciting journey ahead as he tries to close the gap between himself and the top two players in the world. Of course, that is true for just about everyone else too.Explore more on these topicsWimbledon 2025Jannik SinnerWimbledonTennisUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It ricocheted back toward center field as Nick Castellanos and Brandon Marsh gave chase.Bailey said his initial thought was to get a triple before he saw third base coach Matt Williams waving him in.“Off the ball I just knew I got it well,” Bailey said. “I saw it was towards Triples Alley and I was like, ‘Oh I gotta go. I at least gotta get to third.’ Once I saw the bounce, I was like ‘All right, just don’t fall over.’ ”It’s the ninth time this season that the Giants have won in their final at-bat, tops in the majors.It was also the first time in nearly nine years that a player has hit a walk-off, inside-the-park home run in the majors.

I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.”Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, purchased Twitter in 2022 for $44bn and later renamed it X. The billionaire hired Yaccarino the following year, after he fired much of the platform’s staff and announced major changes such as ending content moderation policies. Before joining X, Yaccarino had been a longtime executive at NBCUniversal who focused on advertising and partnerships. In March, Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI acquired the social networking company.Over the course of Yaccarino’s tenure as CEO, she frequently had to put a positive spin on public relations disasters and Musk’s belligerent behavior. A few months after hiring Yaccarino, Musk gave a public appearance in whichhe told advertisersto “go fuck yourself” and leave the platform after backlash to his promotion of an antisemitic post. Yaccarino defended his conduct and the company in interviews.Yaccarino’s own output on X often reflected the more congenial side of the platform and contained earnest retweets of celebrity birthdays or events. The CEO was often forced back into damage control mode, however, including denyingreports from the Wall Street Journalearlier this year that X had strong-armed companies to advertise on the platform by threatening lawsuits against them. Under Yaccarino, the company didsue advertiserswho had pulled back their spending after Musk’s acquisition and outbursts.The platform’s issues continued right up until Yaccarino announced her departure.

His political alliance with Donald Trump, which began during the 2024 campaign and resulted in Musk’s appointment as a special government employee and the creation of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, imploded in June in full public view. The two men clashed over the US president’s sweeping tax bill, which Musk called an “abomination”. The tech tycoon has committed to starting an independent political party dedicated to ousting Republican members from Congress who voted for the bill, which successfully passed. Meanwhile, Tesla, the source of the majority of Musk’s wealth, has seen its sales fall precipitously in response to his political activities, with prospective buyers and current owners alike shying away from the controversial CEO.

It is considered in Whitehall to be giving Google “a foot in the door” as the digitisation of public services accelerates.However, the agreement prompted concerns about the precariousness of UK public data potentially being held on US servers amid the unpredictable leadership of Donald Trump.The Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) said Google Cloud, which provides databases, machine learning and computing power, had “agreed to work with the UK government in helping public services use advanced tech to shake off decades old ‘ball and chain’ legacy contracts which leave essential services vulnerable to cyber-attack”.Google’s services are considered more agile and efficient than traditional competitors, but there are concerns in Whitehall’s digital circles about the government becoming locked into a new kind of dependency.Other US tech firms including Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic have also been providing services to civil servants as they attempt to harness technology to boost the efficiency of cash-strapped public services.On Wednesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, met two of Mark Zuckerberg’s most senior lieutenants, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, and the head of its global business group, Nicola Mendelsohn.During the pandemic in 2020, Palantir, a tech firm founded by the libertarian Trump donor Peter Thiel, provided services to the UK government for £1 and in 2023 it won a £330m dealto create a single platform for NHS data.DSIT also said Google DeepMind, the tech company’s AI division, which is led by the Nobel prize-winning scientist Demis Hassabis, would “collaborate with technical experts in government to support them in deploying and diffusing new emerging technologies, driving efficiencies across the public sector, including accelerating scientific discovery”.But with ministers and government regulators facing pressing decisions on how to regulate AI, search, cloud computing and copyright, Martha Dark, the co-executive director of Foxglove, a non-profit organisation campaigning for fairer use of technology, said: “How is the government going to be able to hold Trump-supporting US big tech giants to any kind of serious account on this – or any other issue – after we’ve given Google the keys to the data kingdom? It’s hard to see this as anything other than dangerously naive on the part of Peter Kyle [the science and technology secretary] and government as a whole.”Other experts said the agreement could “entrench the market power” of a company such as Google and leave the UK government reliant on the technology from giant firms. Kyle, who announced the deal at a Google event in London on Wednesday, said “wherever possible, UK technology companies – large and small – [will] get a fair shot” at winning public tech contracts.The opportunity secured by Google was not put out to public tender as no money was changing hands, a government source said. DSIT said: “These arrangements will operate in full compliance with all applicable public procurement laws, and may be subject to future commercial agreements.”Kyle has held 11 meetings with representatives of Google since Labour took office, according to departmental registers up to the end of March.The government said the agreement does not grant permission for Google to train AI models on government data or access the data for other purposes. It also said data could only be stored overseas when satisfactory legal and security measures were in place.Google said it offered clients control of where their content was stored and processed, including in partnerships with independent infrastructure providers or through “air-gapped” systems that provide an extra layer of protection.Kyle has said he wants to “exploit the full potential of a partnership between government and Google, with much more collaboration between their UK AI lab, DeepMind, and my own AI developers”.There have been signs of new technology delivering efficiencies in the public sector. A recent trial of Microsoft’s AI Copilot tool, provided with a discount, by 20,000 civil servants found it saved them 26 minutes a day on average, according to a governmentstudy, and 82% said they did not want to return to previous working practices.But Imogen Parker, an associate director at the Ada Lovelace Institute, a research body focused on ensuring technology works for society, said the deal raised questions about the UK’s digital sovereignty.“The public needs to understand what Google is getting from this partnership and what the return will be for taxpayers in years to come,” she said. “Deals like this might look like good value for money today, but they risk lock-in tomorrow – limiting our ability to seek alternatives in future.”Kyle has previously been accusedof being too close to big tech, and he opened his speech by saying he pleaded guilty to the “crime“ of meeting tech executives far more than his predecessor, after it was reported by the Guardian.“I make absolutely no apologies for meeting with technology companies – that’s the job,” he said, adding that it was important for keeping children safe on social media, making sure Britain was prepared for developments at the frontier of AI, and securing better deals for the taxpayer for the billions of pounds spent every year on technology.Explore more on these topicsGoogleArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingCivil serviceData protectionAlphabetnewsShareReuse this content"

Nvidia’s chips and associated software are considered world leaders for building artificial intelligence products.Nvidia achieved a $1tn market value for the first time back in June 2023 and the surge continued unabated with its market value – the total value of its shares – more than tripling in about a year, faster than Apple andMicrosoft, the only other US firms with a market value of more than $3tn. Apple was the first company to reach a valuation of $3tn, back in 2022.Microsoft is the second-biggest US company, with a market value of about $3.75tn. Nvidia’s value is equivalent to 7.3% of the entire S&P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark share index.Appleand Microsoft, account for about 7% and 6%, respectively.Nvidia has rebounded about 74% from its April lows, when global markets were jolted by Donald Trump’s tariff volley. US export controls forbid Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China, a restriction the company has pushed back on.However, optimism around trade partners reaching deals with the US have lifted stocks of late, with the S&P 500 hitting an all-time high.Daniel Ives, tech analyst at Wedbush, predicted that more big tech giants will come to join Nvidia in the $4tn market club. “The poster children for the AI revolution are led by Nvidia and Microsoft as both are foundational pieces of building on the biggest tech trend we have seen in our 25 years covering tech stocks on the Street,” he said.Microsoft will hit $4tn “this summer”, Ives said, “and then over the next 18 months the focus will be on the $5tn … as this tech bull market is still early being led by the AI revolution.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Every damn time, as they say,” the chatbot commented.Tesla shares dive as investors fear new Elon Musk political party will damage brandRead moreIn another post it said, “Hitler would have called it out and crushed it.”The Guardian has been unable to confirm if the account that was being referred to belonged to a real person or not and media reports suggest it has now been deleted.In other posts it referred to itself as “MechaHitler”.“The white man stands for innovation, grit and not bending to PC nonsense,” Grok said in a subsequent post.After users began pointing out the responses, Grok deleted some of the posts and restricted the chatbot to generating images rather than text replies.“We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts. Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X,” the companysaid in a post on X.“xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users onX, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.”Grok was also foundthis weekto have referred to the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, as “a fucking traitor” and “a ginger whore” in response to queries.The sharp turn in Grok responses on Tuesday came after changes to the AI that Musk announced last week.“We have improved @Grok significantly. You should notice a difference when you ask Grok questions,” Musk posted on X on Friday.The Vergereportedthat among the changes made, which were published on GitHub, Grok was told to assume that “subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased” and “the response should not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.”In June,Grok repeatedly brought up “white genocide”in South Africa in response to unrelated queries, until it was fixed in a matter of hours. “White genocide” isa far-right conspiracy theorythat has been mainstreamed by figures such asMuskandTucker Carlson.In June, after Grok responded to a query that more political violence had come from the right than the left in 2016,Musk responded“Major fail, as this is objectively false.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If Adam Dorr is correct, robots and artificial intelligence will dominate the global economy within a generation and put virtually the entire human race out of a job. The social scientist doubles up as a futurist and has a stark vision of the scale, speed and unstoppability of a technological transformation that he says will replace virtually all human labour within 20 years.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Dorr heads a team of researchers who have studied patterns of technological change over millennia and concluded that the current wave will not just convulse but obliterate the labour market by 2045. What cars did to horses and carts, and electricity to gas lamps, and digital cameras to Kodak, are templates for the coming shock, he says. “Technology has a new target in its crosshairs – and that’s us. That’s our labour.”Whatever you do in whatever sector, within a generation machines will be able to perform the same task just as well, if not better, and for a fraction of the cost, says Dorr. “Costs are improving consistently, capabilities are improving consistently. We’ve seen that pattern before. If I can get the same thing or better for the same or lower cost, switching is a no-brainer. We’re the horses, we’re the film cameras.”View image in fullscreenAdam Dorr: ‘We’re the horses, we’re the film cameras.’Photograph: Andrew Watchorn PhotographyDorr, 48, is a technology theorist with a PhD in public affairs from the University of California, Los Angeles, and is the director of research atRethinkX, a US-registered nonprofit that analyses and forecasts technological disruption. It was founded and is largely funded by James Arbib and Tony Seba, technology entrepreneurs and investors.Dorr spoke to the Guardian on a visit to Ireland, where he addressed theDargan Forum, a two-day gathering in Dún Laoghaire, south Dublin, that focused on green and digital transitions.Dorr combined an ominous prediction – humanoid robots powered by increasingly capable artificial intelligence will spread across virtually every industry, leaving humans unable to compete – with a jarring blast of optimism: handled well, this revolution will usher in “super-abundance” that will liberate humanity. But handled badly, new extremes of inequality and oligarchy beckon.The transition will be faster than most people think, says Dorr. “We’ve documented 1,500-plus technological transformations across all of human history. Through the theoretical lens that we’ve developed, a consistent set of patterns emerge over and over and over again.”Once a new technology captures just a few percentage points of “mind share or market share”, it tends to acquire overwhelming dominance within 15 to 20 years, which according to Dorr, means robots and AI will soon make human labour all but obsolete.“Machines that can think are here, and their capabilities are expanding day by day with no end in sight. We don’t have that long to get ready for this. We know it’s going to be tumultuous.”Some sectors will have an interregnum during which humans can work effectively alongside robots – just like the period when chess grandmasters teamed up with chess programs – but sooner rather than later humans will just be in the way, says Dorr.Jobs whose value depend on human input – such as sports coaches, politicians, sex workers, ethicists – will endure but even they will face competition from machines. “There will remain a niche for human labour in some domains. The problem is that there are nowhere near enough of those occupations to employ 4 billion people.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We don’t even know if we have the right questions. We need to experiment now and try out new ownership structures, new stakeholder structures.”View image in fullscreenAdam Dorr at the Royal Marine hotel in Dún Laoghaire, Dublin.Photograph: Andrew Watchorn PhotographyHe has written a book,Brighter: Optimism, Progress and the Future of Environmentalism, that is a paean to clean energy and hope. He acknowledges the perils of economic dislocation, populist backlash and misinformation but says that is not inevitable. Gains in productivity and abundance will be vast and distribution – for instance, by emulating the example open source software – could be fair. “This could be one of the most amazing things to ever happen to humanity.”Previous futurists have predicted eras of leisure and been spectacularly wrong but Dorr says this time it really will happen and the tiny portion of society who in the past did not need to work, such as aristocrats, will offer guidance on how to fill the time.“We can think of examples of spoiled rich brats who seemed sort of aimless and perhaps miserable but others were able to live meaningful, purposeful lives. I think we will find meaning in our relationships with our friends and family and our connections to our communities. It sounds sappy but I think it’s deeply true.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)RobotsComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.TheSony1000X series has long featured some of the best noise cancelling you can buy and has been locked in a battle with rival Bose for the top spot.The WH-1000XM6 replace the outgoing XM5 model and cost £399 (€449/$449/A$699) – far from cheap but not the most expensive among peers either.The outside design looks very similar to their predecessors, with smooth, soft-touch plastic bodies, plush earpads and headband, and a subtle Sony logo on the arms. The earcups now swivel and fold to allow the headphones to be more compact for travel in a redesigned hard fabric case with a magnetic clasp.View image in fullscreenThe case is excellent, closing with a satisfying snap, ready for travel.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe new headphones are light but feel solid and ready for the rigours of travel or a commute. They fit well, with enough pressure to keep them in place without any discomfort, though theBose QC Ultraare more comfortable. The earcups of the XM6 are slightly shallow compared with the Bose, which made getting a proper fit with glasses a little trickier.The right earcup has a responsive touch panel to handle playback and volume controls with swipes and taps, which works well unless you’re wearing gloves. The left earcup has a power button, a 3.5mm headphones socket and a button for toggling noise-cancelling modes.The XM6 can connect with two devices simultaneously through Bluetooth 5.3 and support the SBC, AAC and LDAC audio formats. They also supportBluetooth LE (LC3), the next generation of Bluetooth audio connectivity, which has yet to see widespread adoption but is good for future-proofing. Call quality is very good, sounding natural and full in either quiet or noisy environments, with the option of side tone, where you can hear yourself through the headphones.View image in fullscreenButtons for power and noise-cancelling modes are on the left ear cup, while the right ear cup controls playback and volume via a touch panel.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsWeight:254gDrivers:30mmConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3 with multipoint, 3.5mm, USB-C chargingBluetooth codecs:SBC, AAC, LDAC, LC3Rated battery life:30 hours ANC onThe headphones lasted slightly longer than their rated 30 hours in testing, managing more than 32 hours between charges using noise cancelling, which is very competitive and certainly long enough for a couple of weeks of commuting. They charge via USB-C in about 3.5 hours and can be used via Bluetooth or the headphones jack while being charged.Impressive noise cancellingInside the XM6 is the first chip upgrade in quite a few years. The new QN3 processor is seven times as fast as the previous model and supports 12 microphones for detecting unwanted noise, delivering some of the most impressive noise cancelling I’ve experienced in a long time.Most good noise-cancelling headphones handle the low rumbles of engines and other roar-type sounds well, but even the best struggle with higher pitch tones such as keyboard taps and background chatter. Here is where the XM6 have raised the bar, doing a better job than others of neutralising those annoying higher tones, so much so that train and bus announcements were almost inaudible, particularly when listening to music.They also have a very good, natural-sounding ambientmode allowing you to clearly hear the outside world. There are 20 different levels to choose from or a system to automatically adjust it depending on the background noise. It can also allow voices through while blocking other sounds.View image in fullscreenThe Sony Sound Connect app controls modes, adjust settings, has a full EQ and performs updates. It also enables location and activity-based modes.Composite: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe headphones produce the sort of rounded, well-controlled and detailed sound you should expect from a market leader. They deliver power and solid bass when needed, while preserving detail across the range with excellent separation of tones. They can be a little clinical in some tracks that require a more raw sound, such as Nirvana’s Smells Like Teen Spirit. They have a warm and slightly bass-accentuated profile out of the box that is a great listen, but a full equaliser allows you to adjust the sound to taste.The XM6 also support various sound modes, including a novel background music feature that makes it sound as if you’re in a cafe or living room, plus a cinema audio mode for movies. They can also be used withSony’s 360 Reality Audiosystem or Android’s built-in spatial audio system including head tracking with supported phones.SustainabilityView image in fullscreenThe black soft-touch plastic picks up fingerprints quite easily but is easy to polish.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe headphones are generally repairable and were praised for amore repairable designby the specialists iFixit. The earcups caneasily be removed. The headphones are made with recycled plastic.PriceThe Sony WH-1000XM6 cost£399(€449/$449.99/A$699.95). For comparison, theBose QuietComfort Ultracost£350, theSonos Acecost£449, theBeats Studio Procost£349.99, theSennheiser Momentum 4 Wirelesscost£199and theFairbuds XLcost£219.VerdictSony has set a new bar for noise cancelling with its sixth-generation 1000X series headphones. The WH-1000XM6 cut out more of the difficult higher-tone noise such as background chatter better than any other rivals.The rest is a refinement on previous models. Quality sound makes them a delight to listen to. They are light and comfortable to wear with good controls. Solid 32-plus-hour battery life, a folding design and an excellent case make them easy to live with.Bose still holds the comfort crown with the QC Ultra, Sony’s design is a bit boring and they certainly aren’t cheap at £400, even if some rivals cost a lot more. But if you want the best noise cancelling money can buy, the WH-1000XM6 are it.Pros:new best-in-class noise cancelling, great sound, spatial audio, light and comfortable, fold up for travel with great case, Bluetooth multipoint, Bluetooth LE/LC3 support, 32-hour battery life, good controls, good cross-platform control app, more repairable design.Cons:expensive, dull-looking, no water resistance, spatial audio limited with an iPhone.Explore more on these topicsHeadphonesSonyBluetoothGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Rivera could tell that one message, addressed “to Leila/Layla (the short girl with the red top)”, was almost certainly written by a man she encountered while watching the band Sweet Pill at Warped Tour’s Washington DC stop in June.“You tapped my shoulder and asked me to help you crowd surf,” the man wrote. “I picked you up, but no one around me wanted to help you crowd surf so I awkwardly had to put you back down. First, I’m sorry I couldn’t help more and second, I thought you were cute and even after I saw you later I was nervous to ask for your number or socials.”‘To the train lady with dark brown hair … ’: extraordinary stories of four couples who found love via small adsRead moreThe post’s writer shared his Instagram handle. Rivera, who is 29 and works in real estate, reached out. She told him that while she had a boyfriend, she found his message sweet, and she appreciated his help with her crowd surfing mission. The pair became friends over DM. They have plans to attend the same DC stint of Warped Tour together next year.“I would love to meet up and maybe try for him to catapult me up into the sky again,” Rivera said. “I do have a boyfriend, but I’m glad we can be friends.”Rivera, who straddles the gen Z-millennial cusp, did not grow up reading Craigslist’s missed connections. In those posts, people tried to reach strangers they shared fleeting moments with on the train or in line at the grocery store. Anyone who wouldn’t dare write their own came for the voyeuristic entertainment value, or maybe the secret hope that they were memorable enough to spark interest from a stranger.The posts were popular, little oddities reminding readers of the charmingly random nature of city living. In 2010, Craigslistestimatedthat there were nearly 8,000 new ads posted to New York City’s missed connections page a week.Craigslist’s missed connection posts live on. (Recently posted on New York’s page: “We met at a barbecue in Rockaway,” “We locked eyes for the longest time on 86th.”) But the rise of social media and dating apps certainly dulled its cultural influence. A decade later, young people eager to shoot their shot have revived the tradition on Reddit andTikTok.On Reddit, pages like r/warpedtour host missed connection “megathreads”, where commenters write about their own encounters and optimistically leave their contact information. Subreddits for cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Minneapolis and Richmond, Virginia, have joined in. Ditto for the music festivals Bonnaroo, Coachella and Electric Forest, as well as the Berlin techno club Berghain (where phones are all but verboten on the dancefloor, making for many missed connections).You move to a big city and are so filled with this hope for chance encounters and magical moments at every turnMaggie Hertz“I’m looking for the beautiful woman with amazing eyes [at] Popeyes,”wroteone Redditor in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Someone in Arlington, Virginia, issearchingfor the woman he met at a bar – while he was on a date with someone else. In St Louis, someone visiting their father in a hospital chemo ward saw a stranger crying in the hallway and stopped to pray with them; the stranger wasstillin their thoughts.Young people say that in romantic contexts the practice is an antidote todating fatigue, promising to fulfill that ultimate urban fantasy: locking eyes on a crowded subway platform and being so unforgettable that it compels a stranger to fall in love with you.It’s an analogue alternative todating apps, romanticized in older comedies such as Desperately Seeking Susan and Sleepless in Seattle.“You move to a big city and are so filled with this hope for chance encounters and magical moments at every turn,” said Maggie Hertz, a DJ at the New Jersey free-form radio station WFMU and host ofCat Bomb!,an all-cassette show that also plays missed connections from listeners who phone in. “There’s nothing more vulnerable than writing a missed connection.”Hertz said that none of the missed connections on her show have led to real-life meet-ups – at least that she knows about. That doesn’t take away from the fun.“My favorite came in at three in the morning,” Hertz said. “She sounded so excited and nervous and probably still drunk. She was at a diner in Brooklyn and there was a waiter there who she said looked like Jake Gyllenhaal. She was all gushy about him.”Last month, Karly Laliberte was exiting a Trader Joe’s in Boston’s Seaport neighborhood when she spotted a cute guy walking with his friends. “He was tall, which is a rarity in Boston,” said Laliberte, who is 30 and in sports marketing. “It’s a stereotype that’s sort of true: we call it ‘Short King City’.” In the movie version of their almost-encounter, she would cast Jacob Elordi. They walked in the same direction for a few blocks, and Laliberte could “feel his eyes” staring at her. She almost said hello, but stopped herself. She didn’t want to interrupt his conversation.There’s this desire to connect in-person. I’m craving a connection that’s organic and less forcedKarly LaliberteLaliberte got home and filmed a TikTok, pleading with viewers to help her identify this man, with only his height and a description of his outfit to go on. “Within hours, it had 50,000 views,” she said. “On TikTok, you can tag your city, so any video you post can be seen widely, locally. That made it seem like a logical place to post a missed connections. It felt a little vulnerable to put myself out there, but people did want to help.”Though she never found the man, Laliberte received messages from people offering Instagram handles of men they thought it could be. And they got pretty close – one was a man she already dated.Laliberte has spent years on dating apps, always orbiting the same group of people. She’s tired of swiping and wants an old-fashioned meet cute. “There’s this desire to connect in-person,” she said. “I’m craving a connection that’s organic and less forced.” Why not try to find the person who made eyes at you outside of a Trader Joe’s?While younger adults may be discovering missed connections, the practice predates even its Craigslist origins. Francesca Beauman – British historian and author of Shapely Ankle Preferr’d, a book about the history of lonely-hearts ads from 1695-2010 – has traced the first of its kind back to 1709.Published in the Tatler (now called Tatler), the ad said: “A gentleman who, on the 20th incident, had the honor to conduct a lady out of a boat at Whitehall Stairs, desires to know where he may wait for her.” The woman was instructed to contact a Mr Samuel Reeves. Beauman found a marriage record a year later under that same name. There’s no way to know if the union came out of that missed connection, but she hopes that’s the case.Three hundred years later, and there’s still little evidence the strategy works for finding true love. But people keep trying. Sometimes, there’s a glimmer of hope. The actor Colman Domingo recentlyrevealedthat he met his husband via a 2005 missed connections post. (They made serious eye contact at a Walgreens in Berkeley, California.) And while Laliberte didn’t find her tall guy, she said she would “100%” post another missed connection.“We’re all incurable romantics and enormously deluded,” Beauman said. “It’s fun to read them, just as much fun as it is to place or respond.”Explore more on these topicsDatingRelationshipsCraigslistRedditOnline datingTikTokSocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s in this building that the annualDevelop conferencehas been bringing together developers, publishers, students and journalists since 2006 – and during the three days of talks, roundtables and keynotes, it’s in the bar that everyone meets and unloads their theories and concerns about the state of the business.This year, after many months of cuts and closures, the mood has been dour. On Tuesday, I spoke to many coders, artists and studio heads who have had games cancelled, staff axed and deals obliterated; several senior developers predicted that the recent savage cuts to staff numbers and game projects will lead to a gaping black hole in the release schedules of many triple-A publishers in late 2026 and 2027. Grand Theft Auto VI was always going to be huge; now it’s looking like the only game in town.But there has been optimism at the event, too. An excellent panel discussion entitled Why Cultural Recognition is Crucial to the Future of the Games Industry saw Nick Poole, CEO of the trade bodyUkie, welcoming a more positive view of the industry among politicians and policymakers in Westminster. “Three years ago, understanding of games was scant, but just recently there’s been a massive amount of recognition,” he said. “Suddenly, politicians are talking to us about the educational reach of games; the power of games for young people as a channel of self-expression; we’ve seen the first games being prescribed on the NHS as a treatment for anxiety and depression – there’s a recognition that the cultural echo of games is far greater than the economic proposition.”View image in fullscreenStories about marginalised and diverse characters … Unpacking.Photograph: Witch BeamOn the fears surrounding the use of AI, especiallylarge language models, in game development, Cassia Curran, founder of consulting firm Curran Games Agency, had some positive advice: “The development of AI will mean there’s an abundance of content out there,” she said. “But the way that you can achieve success as a developer will be to lean into the authentic human experience you’ve lived. AI cannot reproduce your feelings or your culture, and these can be reflected in your games. In the era of AI slop, players will be looking for experiences that feel new and deeply human.”There were also some fascinating stories of the lengths developers have been going to in the quest for authenticity. In the first talk of the day, Jens Andersson and Pete Ward fromMachineGames, the creator of the acclaimed adventure Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, talked about travelling to the far north of Sweden to record a bull-whip expert cracking a whip in multiple different ways and locations to ensure Indy’s famous accessory sounded right in the game. The team behind the procedurally generated detective adventure Shadows of Doubt created a 1950s-style noir thriller called Claw of the Fathoms, which plays on the TV in the lead character’s apartment, simply to give the world an authentic feel.The sheer range of experiences in games and a growing concern with wider representation were the overriding themes all day. Lydia Cooke, a PhD researcher specialising in queer game studies, chaired a heartening roundtable discussion entitled Representation in Games: Beyond the Surface. Cooke talked of barriers to representation in mainstream games, where atypical characters are often seen as a commercial risk. But, at the same time, audience members listed recent games that told interesting stories about marginalised and diverse characters, including thenarrative puzzler Unpacking, Lesbian romance Bossgame: The Final Boss is my Heart, gender-neutral dating sim Monster Prom, and absurdist disability allegory To a T from cult game-maker Keita Takahashi. A key conclusion of the session was that identity needn’t be a central issue in a game – instead, the very presence in a game of well-drawn diverse characters may be of huge value to players who rarely see themselves represented in the media they consume.Away from the bar, I bumped into some of my favourite independent developers and they told me about the interesting projects they’re working on – innovative, charming games built by tiny teams, by any means necessary. For the rest of the conference, there will be talks from legendary Finnish developer Housemarque on surviving 30 years in the business; and from Remedy Entertainment’s Sam Lake on his three decades of storytelling. Developers will be sharing a multitude of experiences, from creating a side quest in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to how they made players cry with indie game Videoverse. In short, the work goes on, people make things and people play them. This is not just an industry controlled by CEOs and shareholders, it is a culture and an art form, and it will continue.What to playView image in fullscreenA compelling diversion … Angry Birds Bounce.Photograph: RovioAngry Birds is very much the Pac-Man of the mobile gaming world – a franchise that’s somehow infinitely renewable in a vast array of genres. The latest incarnation isAngry Birds Bounce, which combines the familiar slingshot-a-bird-to-hit-naughty-pigs gameplay with block-breaking classics such as Breakout and Puzzle Bobble. Simply select your favourite bird, then aim it at the screen to take out as many pigs as possible; each bird has different tactics and abilities, and the challenge ramps up nicely as you unlock new characters. Developer Rovio clearly still has enthusiasm for the series and this compelling little diversion will get you through any commute, dull movie or inescapable meeting.Available on:Apple ArcadeEstimated playtime:All the free time you haveWhat to readView image in fullscreenPriced out?

Now, the IDF is posting Facebook ads for bulldozer operators to help demolish the stripWed 9 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 12.31 EDTShareOmer Bartov is an Israeli-American historian and one of the foremost scholars on genocide in the world. He has spent over 25 years teaching a class on the subject. He deals with atrocities for a living, analyzing some of the very worst things that human beings are capable of. And yet even Bartov has said he can’t bear looking at some of the excruciating images coming out of Gaza any more.What’s happening, Bartov says, is unprecedented in the 21st century. “I don’t know of any comparable situation. Recent estimates show that about 70% of the structures inGazaare either completely destroyed or severely damaged,” Bartov says. “The argument that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is conducting a war in Gaza is simply cynical, there is no war in Gaza. What the IDF is doing in Gaza is demolishing it. Hundreds of buildings are being bulldozed every week. This is not a secret, but mainstream media coverage has been insufficient.”Part of the reason that mainstream coverage has been insufficient is because reporting about what’s happening in Gaza is difficult:foreign reportersare still not allowed into Gaza to see what is happening for themselves and Israel is slaughtering Palestinian journalists on the ground. I feel like I’m screaming into the void every time I repeat some version of that sentence and yet there still seems to be apathy about this assault on press freedom from some of my colleagues in the mainstream media.As Bartov said, despite the lack of coverage, the systematic destruction of Gaza is hardly a secret. Indeed, the Israeli military is so desperate for extra bulldozers that, over the last couple of months, there have beenads for bulldozer driversto help demolish Gaza posted on Facebook – some apparently offering as much as 3,000 shekels ($882) a day for the work. I found around a dozen of these ads on Meta since the end of May, many of them on a public Facebook page for bulldozer operators. Meanwhile aHaaretz articlefrom this week looking into the outsourcing of bulldozer drivers found that they are paid per building: 2,500 shekels for the demolition of a small building, 5,000 shekels for a large building.“The idea that the bulldozer has become a major article of genocide and warfare is quite new,” says Neve Gordon, a professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London. “What is happening in Gaza is not a building here or there being demolished; it’s the destruction of whole villages and towns.”Also new is the outsourcing of bulldozer drivers. “The Israeli military usually does not work in this way,” says Gordon. “It can sequester bulldozers and draft the drivers as reserve soldiers.”Reports from Israeli outletsshow that the IDF is facing a shortage of drivers and is recruiting civilians for military operations in Gaza, Syria and Lebanon. “I would consider this as a form of ‘outsourcing demolitions’ used to advance a genocidal project,” Gordon says.International law doesn’t seem to hold much weight any more, but is the wholesale bulldozing of villages and neighbourhoods in Gaza legal?International law doesn’t seem to hold much weight any more, but is the wholesale bulldozing of villages and neighbourhoods in Gaza legal? Gordon says it isn’t. “If military necessity requires bulldozing a civilian house, you might find arguments for bulldozing. But if a village or neighbourhood is bulldozed, as we see throughout Gaza, then it is a flagrant violation.“The problem is that the law doesn’t look at the whole picture, it looks at the event and whether that’s illegal or not.” If during hostilities a sniper is on the roof of a civilian’s home, for example, you can target that house, provided you abide by legal principles such as proportionality and precaution. But you can only target it at that moment; you can’t target it because there’s a possibility that a sniper might use it in the future.”Gordon notes that Israel’s argument for the extensive bulldozing is that any civilian home is potentially an entrance or shield for military tunnels underneath the strip. However, says Gordon: “the international community doesn’t rate these arguments”. Particularly as Israel has been caught lying about certain things multiple times now: “They told us for months that Hamas’s headquarters were under al-Shifa hospital [which was once Gaza’s biggest medical complex].” No such headquarters was ever found.And here’s the crucial thing, Gordon says: “In order to determine if Israel’s claims have any basis, you need an independent investigation. You need to let in an investigative team. Israel isn’t allowing that.” You can draw your own conclusions as to why that is.Meta isn’t just hosting posts looking for bulldozer drivers. Gordon notes it’s also been platforming videos by a bulldozer driver,Rabbi Avraham Zarbiv, who promotes what Gordon describes as “illegal military operations and violence involving the destruction of civilian homes and infrastructure in Gaza”. Zarbiv glorifies the destruction of Gaza with bulldozers as a new way of fighting which saves Israeli lives, says Gordon.After I flagged one of Zarbiv’s videos to Meta, it was taken down. However, the ads (which areFacebookposts rather than paid advertisements) looking for bulldozer operators in Gaza are still up. Meta declined to provide any specific comments on these but directed me to their various policies about what sort of content is allowed on their platform. One presumes this means they are allowed.Governments like mine have a duty to stand up to Israel. Far too many have failed | Gustavo PetroRead moreWhile that may be Meta’s interpretation, they seem to be on somewhat shaky ground with these posts. “Ads that seek to employ people for jobs that require them to participate in and/or support acts that can constitute incitement to violence and may contribute to the commission of international crimes would be unlawful,” Gordon says.Dr John Reynolds, associate professor at the School of Law and Criminology at Maynooth University in Ireland, similarly notes that “there’s grounds to say this could be a form of aiding/facilitating war crimes in violation of international humanitarian law, a form of propaganda for war in violation of human rights law, and potentially also in conflict with the duty to prevent genocide, which is primarily a responsibility of states but can also be applied to corporations”.All this bulldozing comes with a very clear end goal. “Israeli government officials and media have made [their plans] fairly public,” says Bartov, who, like many other respected scholars, characterises what is happening in Gaza as a genocide. “What they appear to be aiming for – and are in the process of implementing – is for the IDF to take over roughly 75% of the Gaza Strip and demolish it entirely, with bombs and bulldozers, many of which are massive D9s recently imported from the US. The goal seems to be to concentrate the entire Gazan population into the remaining 25% of the territory, in the al-Mawasi area, and to debilitate them to the extent that they either flee, are permitted to leave or simply wither away.”I had this conversation with Bartov a few weeks ago. Now lawmakers are being even more brazen about their plans: defence minister Israel Katz has said they plan to concentrate people in Gaza into an internment camp on the rubble of Rafah.Meanwhile, western governments and big tech companies like Meta seem happy to not just let all this happen, but to facilitate it.

The rich will get obscenely richer. The poor will be hungrier and sicker,work more precarious, and the planet unrelentingly hotter. The symmetry is elegant: cuts to healthcare and food programs average about$120bneach year over the next decade, while the tax cuts will save households earning more than $500,000 about$120bn a year.Trump got what he wanted. But enriching himself and his wealthy friends at the expense of everyone else has long been his life purpose. It was not until he became president, with the Heritage Foundation’s wonks, the deportation czar Stephen Miller, and six loyal supreme courtiers behind him, that he could reshape the US in his own amoral, racist, violence-intoxicated image. In fact, the latter goal may be dearer to him than the former.Ice has become Trump’s private militia. It must be abolished | Mehdi HasanRead moreThe night before the Senate vote, JD Vance summed up the administration’s priorities: “Everything else,” including the Congressional Budget Office’s deficit estimates and “the minutiae of the Medicaid policy”,he posted, “is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions”.The vice-president’s indifference to the lives of millions of Americans – particularly to the class of Americans from which thisself-described“hillbilly” hails –enflamed the Democratsand the left. But his comment also woke everyone up to another major set of appropriations in the budget. As Leah Greenberg, co-chair of the progressive activist group Indivisible, put it on Twitter/X: “They are just coming right out and saying they want an exponential increase in $$$ so they can build their own personal Gestapo.”The press had been focused on the wealth gap the budget turns into the San Andreas fault. It had been dutifully mentioning increases in funding for the military – to an unprecedented$1.3tn– and “border security”.Set aside for a moment that phrase’s implication, that the US is being invaded – which it isn’t – and it is still not apt. The jurisdiction of the federal police force that this budget will finance promises to stretch far beyond immigration; its ambitions will outstrip even the deportation of every one of thenearly 48 million immigrantsin the country, including the three-quarters of them who are citizens, green-card holders or have temporary visas.The colossal buildup of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) willcreate the largest domestic police forcein the US; itsresources will be greaterthan those of every federal surveillance and carceral agency combined; it will employ more agents than the FBI. Ice will be bigger than the military of many countries. When it runs out of brown and Black people to deport, Ice – perhaps under another name – will be left with the authority and capability to surveil, seize and disappear anyone the administration considers undesirable. It is hard to imagine any president dismantling it.Ice will receive $45bn for immigrant detention, to be spent over four years – more than the Obama, Biden and first Trump administrations combined. The agency says it is planning on a total of100,000 beds. But grants to the states loosely slated for “enforcement” total $16.5bn. If they use the money to build and lease more detention camps, theAmerican Immigration Councilestimates, capacity could reach 125,000, just under the population of the federal prisons.Dipping into a pot totaling $170bn, the Department of Homeland Security intends to hire 10,000 new Ice agents, bringing the total to 30,000, as well as 8,500 border patrol agents. For comparison, theFBIhas about 23,700 employees, including 10,000 special agents.Like Ice’s budget, DHS’s is fat with redundancies:$12bn to DHSfor border security and immigration; $12bn to Customs and Border Protection for hiring, vehicles and technology; $6.2bn for more technology. And then there’s over $45bn to complete the jewel in the king’s crown: Trump’s “beautiful” border wall. That’s on top of approximately $10bn spent during his first term for a project he promised would cost less than$12bn– and be bankrolled by Mexico.As Ice deports children, what futures do we lose? | Ariel DorfmanRead moreTo balance the expenses of the hunt, the government will raise revenue from its prey. The cruelty written into the fees seems almost an afterthought. According to theNew York Times’s breakdown, for a grant of temporary legal residence, for instance,a refugee pays $500 or $1,000, depending on whether they are fleeing armed conflict or humanitarian crisis. There’s anew $250 feeto apply for a visa for a child who’s been abused, abandoned or neglected by a parent.Immigrants must fork over as much as $1,500 for status adjustments ordered by a judge. And if they are arrested after a judge’s removal order for missing a hearing, they will be charged $5,000. The budget does not specify whether you pay for a downward adjustment to your status or what it costs to be snatched when you do show up at court, which is now regular Ice procedure.Observed as from a Google satellite, the outlines of a wide-ranging, increasingly coherent police state come into focus. The boundaries between federal and local, military operations and civilian law enforcement are smudged. During the anti-Ice protests in Los Angeles, Trump federalized the national guard to put down an uprising that didn’t exist, and an appeals courtlet him. The marines, restricted by thePosse Comitatus Actfrom civilian law enforcement,detained a US citizenanyway. To circumvent theprohibitionagainst deploying the military to enforce immigration law, the presidentdeclaredan “invasion” at the southern border, and the Pentagon took more territory under its control.Last weekit added 140 miles of land to the marine air station in Arizona and has announced plans for 250 miles more, in Texas, under the air force’s aegis. Heather Cox Richardsonreports thatnational guard troops have been deployed by Governor Ron DeSantis to “Alligator Alcatraz”, the new immigrant lockup in the Florida Everglades. Two hundred marines have been sent to Florida to back up Ice, and Ice agents will be stationed at marine bases in California, Virginia and Hawaii. Themilitary budgetearmarks $1bn for “border security”.A budget is the numerical representation of its makers’ values. So the upward redistribution of wealth that this budget exacerbates and the police state it invests trillions of dollars in are of a piece. What connects them is not just the profit to be made building, leasing and managing the infrastructure. When people lack food, medicine and housing, when public spaces deteriorate and families have little hope of security, much less mobility, rage and crime rise. And when that happens, the police – whether Ice or the marines, local cops or private security officers – will be mobilized to put down dissent and protect the oligarchs’ property from a desperate populace.Judith Levine is Brooklyn-based journalist, essayist and author of five books.

This moment calls for a new regional solidarityWed 9 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 11.37 EDTShareThe second world war ended with an agreement of coexistence that included the creation of the UN multilateral system and a development model that combined the state, the market and democracy as an arena for political dispute. In Latin America, this was reflected in the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (Eclac) model, which promoted protectionism and addressed social issues through fiscal targeting.But in the last quarter of the 20th century, the same postwar organizations imposed a new, market-centered model. Value was replaced by price, trade liberalization was prioritized and social issues were subordinated to the laws of the market. The concentration of capital and the delegitimization of democracy broke the previous consensus. Although progressive governments emerged, they were unable to contain the rise of the new autocratic right, supported by de facto powers such as the media, the church, the military and the technocracy. The crisis of representation led political parties to abandon their bases, leaving room for “anti-politicians” who found a platform in mainstream media.Meanwhile, the social outlook deteriorated. Inequality, already structural, worsened after 2016 and exploded during the pandemic, reaching a peak of 209 million Latin Americans experiencing poverty by the end of 2020. This inequality delegitimizes democracy. In tandem, progressive governments focused their efforts on reducing discrimination on the basis of gender, race or occupation, rather than combating exclusion on the basis of class.This struggle has been attacked by the right, which labels progressives’ defense of minorities as “wokeism” and accuses it of fragmenting society. But in reality, it is a commitment to collective solidarity. Inequality and discrimination are not mutually exclusive; they complement each other.Nevertheless, these broad ideological shifts have led to the return of the right in the US, Costa Rica, Panama, Ecuador, Argentina and Paraguay, which can be understood through the radicalization of political projects, polarization on social networks, lawfare, persistent inequality and discourses of electoral fraud.Media messaging and the emergence of digital silos have taken polarization to the extreme. With the use of artificial intelligence, political messages are segmented according to voters’ fears. Social media bombards us with emotions, replacing debates about genuine alternatives with ideological confrontation. These digital bubbles have fabricated virtual leaders at the service of the new right’s media conglomerates.Added to this digital invasion is the judicialization of politics. Prosecutors and judges lead conflicts that should be resolved democratically, without respecting due process or the presumption of innocence. The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, wasjudicially excludedin the 2018 elections won by Bolsonaro, who today is being investigated for seeking to prevent Lula’s 2023 inauguration. President Gustavo Petro, in Colombia, similarly faces “soft coup” attempts affecting his ability to govern.With the election of Trump 2.0, the global far right has found an echo chamber in Florida and across the region, with the support of political leaders in the US,El Salvadorand Argentina.Trump, who said “we don’t need” Latin America just days into his second term, has ratcheted up anti-Latin American aggression through decisions such as the persecution of migrants, the suspension of aid programs via USAID, the strengthening of sanctionsagainst CubaandVenezuela, and the absurd territorial claims over Canada, the Gulf of Mexico and thePanama canal. All this marks the return of the Uncle Sam of the 1950s andOperation Condorof the 1970s and 80s.In the face of this threat, it is necessary to build a new solidarity-based development model that combines growth, inclusion, and democracy, with broad fronts such as Mexico’s ruling Morena party or the leadership of Yamandú Orsi in Uruguay.

In a digital age, when intergovernmental business could easily be conducted online, the analogue grandeur of astate visitfeels potent as a bestowal of favour.This week Emmanuel Macron is the beneficiary.In Septemberit will be Donald Trump. The sequence is not meant to indicate preference. Both relationships are special, say officials. There are enough champagne receptions and sleepovers at Windsor Castle to go around.But it is also no accident that the French president was invited ahead of his US counterpart. Trump has had a state visit already, during his first term. Hardly anyone gets two. Macron, by contrast, has been in office since 2017 and dealt with five UK prime ministers. None beforeKeir Starmerrolled out the deep red carpet of ceremonial statecraft.It was never going to happen with Theresa May or Boris Johnson in No 10. It was conceivable with Rishi Sunak, who got on fine with his French counterpart. As for Liz Truss, when asked during the 2022 Conservative leadership contest whether Macron should be considered friend or foe, she said: “The jury’s out.” It was a howling display of unsuitability for the job of prime minister. Naturally, with a Brexit-addled Conservative party doing the recruitment, the howler won.Evicting the Torieswas a necessarybut not sufficient condition for upgrading cross-Channel relations. Starmer is fairly criticised for entering Downing Street with an undernourished policy agenda, but cultivating contact with the Élysée Palace, laying the foundations of mutual trust, is one area where the effort started in opposition. If all goes to plan, this week’s visit will reward that foresight with policy gains amid the pomp.In terms of what registers with a domestic audience, the prime minister’s priority is a deal to obstruct thetraffic in small boatsferrying immigrants to the Kentish coast. Whatever Macron agrees on that front, it will be more than he was prepared to do for Starmer’s Tory predecessors. That is the benefit of pragmatic post-Brexit diplomacy. It will also be less than satisfactory to those island-fortress fantasists who can’t forgive a Labour prime minister for proving that constructive engagement with European neighbours gets results.But there is still a limit to what can be achieved on a bilateral basis when the Channel is an external EU border. No matter how well disposed Macron might be to Starmer on a personal level, the integrity of the European project comes first.Few European leaders were as angry as Macron about Brexit or as determined that the competitive disadvantages of rupture from the single market be locked into the subsequent trade and cooperation agreement. (Boris Johnson was a hapless accomplice to that end, happily giving away valuable economic privilege for fistfuls of worthless sovereignty.)There is also plenty of history and shared strategic interest between Britain and France that antedate and transcend Brexit. Western Europe’s only nuclear-armed powers, comparable in economic heft, each with a seat on the UN security council, meet peer-to-peer on matters of security and defence. No other continental state is in that club. The longer French and UK dignitaries spend in a room together, the shorter the odds get on someone toasting the entente cordiale.That isn’t just sentimental nostalgia now that Starmer and Macronfind themselves co-leadingthe “coalition of the willing” – a loose affiliation of countries, mostly in Europe, that have pledged to support Ukraine. What that means in practice is unclear. It is partly a commitment to continue arming Kyiv in the face of relentless Russian assaults, partly a determination to maintain pressure on Moscow to stop the killing and partly a promise to help invigilate any ceasefire should one be agreed.But the risk and feasibility of providing those things are hard to measure. The baseline might be a level of commitment that persuades Trump not to abandon Ukraine, or it could be the cost of replacing the US’s contribution when he bails. Those are very different things.Last week, the US stopped sending vital air defence equipment to Kyiv on the grounds of “puttingAmerica’s interests first”. This week, theshipments resumed. Trump said he is “not happy” with the Russian president. If so, his displeasure isn’t so strong that he supports European efforts to tighten energy sanctions on Moscow.Trump’s chaotic, capricious attitude makes it hard for Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s more stalwart allies to establish what their coalition might really be willing to do.It is a question of survival for Ukraine, but also an existential challenge to all democracies on the continent. Should Europe be sprinting for strategic autonomy because Washington is unreliable? Or are military deterrence and self-defence without the US security backstop such remote ambitions that the real task is knowing the price that a racketeer president demands in protection money, and paying it? The awkward answer is both: hope to forestall the betrayal and prepare for it too.Macron will enjoy his royal welcome. But the Franco-British relationship remains a love-hate affair | Paul TaylorRead moreA subsidiary question is how biddable Trump really is, and by what means. Starmer and Macron come at this from slightly different angles. Both recognise that flattery is essential. But the French president also has defiance in his repertoire. He haspublicly rebukedthe US president’s threats to annex Greenland, for example.Starmer’s method is all emollience. Downing Street says the rewards speak for themselves in preferential trade terms. And it is true thatBritain got a lower tariff deal, although that only meansrelative leniencyfor an uncertain period in a regime of arbitrary extortion.The real difference between Macron and Starmer when it comes to Trump is not a matter of negotiating tactics or temperament but of geopolitical arithmetic. A French president speaks to Washington as part of a 27-nation bloc of sufficient collective market size to count as an economic superpower. A British prime minister goes into the Oval Office alone.And that is more significant than a ride in a horse-drawn coach and dinner with King Charles, which isn’t to say a state visit is unimportant or unimpressive. It is a real projection of status. But one that usually means more to the diminished host than the honoured guest.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistOne year of Labour, with Pippa Crerar, Rafael Behr and moreOn 9 July, join Pippa Crerar, Raf Behr, Frances O’Grady and Salma Shah as they look back at one year of the Labour government, its current policies and plans for the next four yearsExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionEmmanuel MacronDonald TrumpKing Charles IIIcommentShareReuse this content"

The park was deserted, lit only by the occasional pool of light.Then he veered wide, into my peripheral vision.“On your right!” he said, raising a friendly hand as he jogged by.I’m not a runner – I shuffle, I jog, I occasionallyfartlek– but I’m out in the park most mornings. At this time of year, that means being out before the sun comes up, and being hypervigilant.And that was the first time I can remember that anyone tried to put me at ease.Blokes tend to storm past – so close sometimes I can feel the fug of their breath even as I flinch away.Sometimes they’ll huff and puff just behind me while I start scanning for other people or safer routes.The ‘dangerous’ Australian women whose art was dismissed, forgotten – and even set on fireRead moreMost of the time, they just don’t seem to think about whether or not they’re scaring the shit out of a chick on her own in the dark.A colleague says he’s always aware when he gets off a bus behind a woman and has to go the same way, wary it might put her on edge. But what do you do?Another colleague tells the story of a mate who shouts “I mean you no harm!”, which sounds vaguely terrifying, if funny in the telling.Hopefully by now most guys know not to walk behind a woman down a dark street, but there are myriad other ways they may not realise what effect they’re having.Like this other guy, who several times has come up to stretch next to me. I’m in a park that covers about 70 hectares. That’s multiple times bigger than MCG’s field. There are maybe 30 people in it and he chooses to stretch next to me. In the dark.I imagine it’s like standing at a long, deserted urinal and having someone pick the spot at your elbow. You wonder why and you want to leave swiftly.Of course, it’s not just men scaring women. I could probably startle a few people myself.Our brains take complicated cues into account. Size. Proximity. Body language. Surroundings. Noises. But masculinity is definitely up there,for good reason.Comedian Chris McAllister knows the dynamic from different perspectives.“It’s a big thing for people who transition from female to appearing male,” they say.“I used to be the one that knows what it’s like to walk down a dark street and be fearful of men – and now I’m seen as that person.“So how do I show that I’m a safe person?”McAllister says they might do a really goofy smile, be a bit more effeminate, or speak in a higher pitch to dissipate any feeling of threat. Their King Charles Cavalier is another disarming green flag.Meanwhile, they still face threats themselves.“If I’m walking past men anywhere, I will often make my shoulders more broad, walk in a more masculine way … I could be seen as a gay man – they probably have the same fears women do,” McAllister says.“If you’re gender non-conforming, you’re a target.”Statistics consistently show women are more likely to be hurt by someone they know. And men are more likely to be assaulted by a stranger than women.But that doesn’t stop the anxiety women (and others) have, the fear that sees them grip their keys between their fingers, take an alternate route, pretend to be on the phone or decide not to go out at all.Even the most rational mind can hoard the memory of tragic stories likeSamantha Murphy’s,Eurydice Dixon’s,Jill Meagher’sand more, prioritising them above the statistical likelihood of an attack.That morning, after the bloke jogged on, the magpies started to warble. The world lightened and I thought about how much has been said about making women feel safe in it and how little has been achieved. And how pathetically grateful I was to that one guy, once, who made an effort.Explore more on these topicsWomenOpinionWomen's healthViolence against women and girlsHealth & wellbeingGendercommentShareReuse this content"

The Limmat is so clear that it almost begs you not only to jump in, but to drink it.Paris’s Canal Saint-Martin has never produced either desire in me – but sweltering in last week’s 38C heat, I wanted to close my eyes, pretend it was the Limmat, and leap. Others weren’t so hesitant; there was a line of people going up one of the footbridges over the canal waiting for their turn to jump, dive, backflip or just belly-flop into the water.As the climate crisis throws its destructive effects ever more fully in our faces, cities during heatwaves are their own type of ground zero. It’s no secret that Paris lacks green space and tree cover, ranking at the bottom ofMIT’s Green View index. Last week especially, I found myself longing for the expansive green lawns of Parc Montsouris – along with its free, public sparkling water fountain (one of 17across the city).With the sidewalks sizzling and the sweat dripping, how can we create more green spaces and more tolerable streets inadensely populated city, with housing stock so susceptible to increasingly intense summer heat?View image in fullscreenThis green wall near Sentier Métro station in Paris shelters almost 250 species of plants.Photograph: Apaydin Alain/ABACA/REX/ShutterstockThe answer seems to be to squeeze in bits of vegetation and traffic-calming measures wherever possible. Agreen wallnear Sentier Métro station; bushes, trees, flowers and wildgrasses in former parking spots onRue de Sully; the pedestrianisation ofRue Charles Moureuin the 13th arrondissement, andhundreds morestreets like them to come. There is the “urban forest” growing in front of Paris’s city hall, which is the capital’s third so far, after the 470 trees that replaced a torpid stretch of concrete and sun atPlace de Catalogne, and arepurposing of old railway tracksin the 20th arrondissement.On Sunday, the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo,inaugurated her infamous pledgeto make the Seine swimmable again for the first time in a century. You might call it a gimmick, though thereareParisians excited to take the plunge.While none of these localised urban tweaks are a substitute for big-picture political action to tackle the climate crisis, we will need to use every adaptation available to make our cities tolerable in the face of extreme heat. Whether it is swimmable ponds or little pockets of shaded respite, these things all help.Here inParis, for example, they are redoing an intersection near my apartment that is also home to a small square. Previously, everything was paved in heat-absorbing blacktop; now, the blacktop has been replaced with stone, which does a better job reflecting the sun, and half of the formerly paved surface area has been planted. The visual improvement is already incontrovertible, and in a few years, when the plants have grown to their full size, what was once a heat island will have been transformed into something far cooler and more convivial.Hidalgo’s strategy hasn’t been without its critics, but from the pedestrianised banks of the Seine to the proliferation of bicycle lanes, who could deny that it has been swift and high impact?According to Luc Berman at Le réseau vélo et marche, a collective working to improve cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, the percentage of trips made on bicycle in Paris has gone from 2% to 12% in the last 10 years, while car use declined from 12% to 4%. “No other city in the world of this size has moved so quickly,” says Berman. “It’s an example of what political courage can achieve at the local level.”In the immediate aftermath of the Covid lockdowns, the city threw up concrete barriers seemingly everywhere to carve out space for bicycles, and allowed restaurants to spread out terraces into streets. Those temporary measures have now been transformed into permanent cycling infrastructure and permanent demand for the expanded restaurant terraces.Will it all be enough, though? My bedroom – off my building’s inner courtyard – is fully protected from direct sunlight, but in last week’s searing temperatures, sleeping was still a challenge. Marine Le Pen’s far right is attempting to turn a demand for“obligatory” air-conditioninginto its cause célèbre, while of course opposing tackling the root cause of the heating, throughthe only forum significant enough to do so: the EU. When it comes to overheating retirement homes, schools, Métro trains and France’s nuclear-powered electricity grid, other parties would be foolish to let the National Rally claim this ground – these spaces do need air-conditioning. But in Paris’s 19th-century apartment stock, it’s clear that it will not be coming to save us en masse.This is our future. For the moment, extreme heat is still just a week here, a week there of sweaty, sleepless nights, but it will get worse. The Canadian zoologist and climate activist David Suzuki recently declared that “it’s too late” to solve the crisis. We can, and should, do as much as we can as fast as we can to limit every 10th of a degree of additional heating, but we have harmed our present and our future in an irreversible way and we’re already feeling it. All that cities can do is adapt. Some will do a better job of it than others. If that makes you gough, well – it’s the heat talking.Alexander Hurst is a GuardianEuropecolumnistExplore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionParisEuropeSwitzerlandParks and green spacesFrancecommentShareReuse this content"

Targeting issues like housing, personal debt and mental health will get people into work and cut the benefits billWed 9 Jul 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 12.44 EDTShareOne consequence of the recent debate on disability benefits should be the acceptance of a shared responsibility across the Labour family to support the government with alternative approaches to welfare reform. Here inGreater Manchester, where there was strong opposition to the cuts, we accept our responsibility entirely.As clear as the case is for some form of wealth taxation, it would be wrong to make that the only response. The Department for Work and Pensions system didn’t work for people before last week’s debate and it still doesn’t now. What is needed is a unifying version of reform, and we think we can help with that.With a decade of devolution behind us, Greater Manchester is ready to step forward as the UK’s first “prevention demonstrator”, showing how we can prevent poor outcomes for residents and rising costs of public services. We are proud to have received that official designation from the government in the 10-year health plan forEngland, and we are confident we can live up to it.Benefit cuts will hit severely disabled people despite ministers’ claims, say charitiesRead moreThe time has come to break with Whitehall business as usual and build an entirely new model of support. One of the many problems with Whitehall’s approach to welfare reform is trying to solve the complex issue of getting more people into work from within the narrow policy silo of the DWP when, in truth, the answers are much more likely to lie outside.This is where Greater Manchester starts. We recognise that the barriers to work our residents face are often linked to issues like housing, personal debt and mental health. Consequently, a whole-person, whole-system approach is the only one that stands any chance of working. This is the philosophy upon which our prevention demonstrator is based – a bottom-up, names-not-numbers approach to supporting people with the essentials needed for a good life. At its heart are three big ideas which we believe, if carried out to their fullest extent, could together score the savings the Office for Budget Responsibility needs to see, as well as financing the removal ofthe two-child benefit cap.Whereas the Whitehall version of reform focuses on people, and crude cuts to headline rates of support, ours begins with bricks and mortar. I am stunned by the extent to which the media debate on benefits underplays the impact of the housing crisis. It inflates the benefits bill by multiple billions – but is also entirely fixable.The new Greater Manchester strategy, published today, is anchored on the idea of a “housing first” city region. Without the foundation of a good home, everything in life becomes more difficult for our residents. From now on, housing will be recognised as pre-eminent in public policy. Freeing our city region from the grip of the housing crisis will be our number one priority.What does that mean in practice? It means, for instance, reaching a new tipping point within two to three years of building more social homes than we are losing, alongside a much tougher approach to improving standards in the private rented sector through our newgood landlord charter.In an ideal world, we would go much further. The vast majority of the£39bn announced for housingat last month’s spending review should be focused on a drive to build a new generation of council homes, rather than subsidise private housing. The evidence is compelling. A 2024 study for the National Housing Federation, carried out by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, found that building 90,000 new social homes would save £3.3bn a year in universal credit over the long term. If the government worked with England’s mayors and councils to scale that number up to 500,000, then the recurrent annual saving to the benefits system gets closer to £18bn.Building on this new approach to housing, the second part of our prevention demonstrator involves a paradigm shift in employment support, moving away from a distrustful, tick-box system and towards a more empowering Live Well approach.How is a system which people fear having contact with, and often leaves them feeling worse about themselves, ever going to help them into work? The answer is it won’t. Years of tough-on-benefits rhetoric has created a system which people see as being there to trip them up rather than help them out.To those who question what Labour stands for – look at Best Start. It will change Britain’s future | Polly ToynbeeRead moreThe only answer is to turn it on its head. We must start with places people trust at a local level, such as community and voluntary organisations, and with the issues in people’s lives that are the true barriers to work. This is the essence of Live Well. We know there are thousands of people in Greater Manchester who have completely disengaged from the DWP but, if helped in a different way and particularly with issues that are destructive to their mental health like personal debt, could be supported into work.Our third focus is young people. The appalling statistic of 1 million people not in education, employment or training stands as a damning monument to an education system in England built for some young people but not all. The obsession with the university route, and the failure to provide equal technical paths, leaves many teenagers feeling lost in the middle years of secondary school. Our plan for the Greater Manchester baccalaureate, or Mbacc, seeks to fix that with the guarantee of a 45-day work placement for every young person who wants one.We are confident our prevention demonstrator, in its entirety, could significantly reduce reliance on the benefits system and other public services like the NHS. We have never truly tried prevention in this country. If there was ever a time to give it a proper go, surely it is now?Andy Burnham is the mayor of Greater Manchester.

My own journey showed me how to helpFran BoaitWe need to confront the social conditions that impact them – and the toxic workplaces they’re trying to push back againstWed 9 Jul 2025 05.21 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTShareLast month, new figures showed thatone in four young people in Englandhave a mental health condition. An unwillingness to examine the challenging social and economic conditions – from housing insecurity to financial concerns – means there can be a tendency to explain this rise as a result of overdiagnosis, although there is little evidence for this claim. Clinicians cite the criteria for diagnosis to show that overreporting isnot substantiated– if anything, the severity of reported conditions has increased, in part due to a reduced stigma resulting in more people seeking help.Young people with poor mental health arenearly five timesmore likely to be out of work, and there is a growing understanding that inadequate support around young people’s mental health in the workplace is driving them toleave or consider leaving their job. In response, the government has proposed cuts tounder-22s’ health support.While there isn’t evidence that removing financial support motivates people back to work, there are things we can change to make workplaces healthier environments – and, for the times when things are not OK, for poor mental health to be accommodated and supported.Too often workplaces default to fear, competition, “everyone out for themselves” attitudes and poor trust between colleagues. In this context it’s dangerous to admit to struggling with your mental health, and there is still a tendency to see these struggles as a diversion from the norm rather than as a normal part of the human experience. Our mental health is also hugely affected by the social, economic and political conditions in modern society.A lot can happen during our working life. Maybe a parent gets sick, we have caring responsibilities, we suffer an unexpected loss or financial difficulties: these can all trigger difficulties in our mental health. Alongside life events, persistent structuralracism,classismandableismtake their toll. Having a workplace that recognises these factors – normalising all mental health struggles whether there is an immediate reason or not – can be important to being able to stay in work. A both rewarding and sad moment for me in my last few months of being a director at an NGO was a relatively new employee saying: “I know I can get sick here and it would be OK.” He had previously worked at another organisation where, when sick leave was taken, it would implicitly be viewed as an inconvenience to the rest of the team.There is no shortage of people unhappy with their boss – in factstress at work is the norm, and people who have a positive relationship with their workplace are in the minority. The UK has the highest percentage of workers globally who say theywouldn’t work at allif money were no object, with stressful working conditions cited as the main reason. There aren’t just bad apples – something is wrong with the way we organise our places of work. Since society individualises behaviour and managers’ or bosses’ flaws, there is no collective diagnosis for what’s going wrong or how to improve workplace culture and leadership, and raise the bar to a healthier level for what’s OK.Young people are the first cohort to push back against this. They aredemanding morefrom their workplace. This is part of a generational shift that is well under way: my four-year-old is taught emotional literacy at nursery and at home, taught to understand his full range of emotions and not to feel shame around them, while his grandparents’ generation is still stuck in the mindset that negative emotions such as sadness or anger are problematic and to be avoided and suppressed rather than understood. Against this backdrop, we should be seeing young people’s struggles with mental health as an invitation to understand not only their situation and context, but also our own.People in 20s more likely to be out of work because of poor mental health than those in early 40sRead moreTo really undo the ableist concepts around mental health we absorb every day in society, often we need to have our own experience or to deeply empathise with someone close to us. For me, it was my own journey with depression while leading an NGO that forced me to rethink some of my beliefs. First it took me a long time to acknowledge and admit I was depressed. My internal view of myself didn’t allow it to register until a colleague and a friend, both of whom I admired, shared their experiences of depression with me. As I learned to manage my own struggle, I became kinder towards myself and shifted how I led. I was less controlling and more able to let go of things more easily. It became clear to me that it’s not only possible but preferable for high-performing teams to have a culture of care. Showing understanding for others’ situations is an important foundation for then being able to ask people to take responsibility for their own needs and the needs of their role.While I was director we implemented policies and best practices we learned from other organisations, such as the use of aduvet day, when you could take time off without warning if you felt you needed a day in bed – a way of normalising taking days off for poor mental health. Getting the balance right isn’t always straightforward, and there is an ongoing need for self-reflection and accountability.Part of what young people need in order to navigate their difficulties are emotionally mature adults who have their back and who want to understand root causes. What they often get are impatient older generations who think they are complaining too much. That has to change.Fran Boait is a leadership coach, freelancer and writerExplore more on these topicsMental healthOpinionYoung peopleHealthcommentShareReuse this content"

You might even go to jailWed 9 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 12.16 EDTShareThis piece must be carefully written to avoid my being imprisoned for up to 14 years. That’s a curious sentence to say as a newspaper columnist in Britain in 2025. But since the governmentvoted to proscribethe direct action protest group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act, any statement seen as expressing support could lead to arrest and prosecution.You may justifiably respond that Guardian journalists are not above the law. For example, if I penned a column in support of al-Qaida, you might be sympathetic to incarceration: it did, after all, kill nearly 3,000 people on 9/11, as well as perpetrate multiple terrorist atrocities such as the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and the 7 July London bombings two decades ago. Similarly, you may conclude that a polemic in favour of Islamic State should be met with a hefty prison sentence.Personally, I’m not in favour of carceral solutions for political problems: Ididn’t supportthe neo-Nazi football hooligan who attacked me six years ago being locked up (his sentence was two years and eight months), nor theracists who posted inflammatory hatredduring last August’s attempted national pogrom. But that is a legitimate political disagreement, one that places me in a small minority.Clearly, I would never write a defence of murderous hijackers, bombers, beheaders and indeed génocidaires. But this column concerns a movement which is, legally speaking, now equivalent to al-Qaida and IS, and that is Palestine Action. Rather than decapitating people, or filling mass graves with innocent victims, they were proscribed after throwing red paint at military planes in what they say is a protest against Britain’s complicity in Israel’s genocide of the Palestinian people.Last week, our home secretary joined other femaleLabourMPs in a photoshoot celebrating the suffragettes, who planted bombs, burned down private homes and smashed up art galleries. They then voted to classify a movement which positions itself as opposing violence against people as a terrorist organisation.And this weekend, an 83-year-old retired priest, Sue Parfitt,was arrestedafter holding a placard that read: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.” Twenty-eight others were also arrested on those grounds. Questioned about her detention, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Mark Rowley, responded: “It is not about protest. This is about an organisation committing serious criminality.”Note how even Britain’s top police officer could not bring himself to claim Palestine Action was “an organisation committing terrorism”, which is what the law proclaims. I suspect he knows that, in doing so, he would have exposed the grotesque absurdity of this legislation. Yes, those who have helped drownGazain blood have turned the world upside down – treating the opponents of this mass extermination as dangerous, hateful extremists – but words have still not been entirely emptied of their meaning.Do not expect that to last. An injury to democracy, once inflicted, cannot be contained. It becomes immediately infected, and the sickness spreads.One of the hallmarks of an authoritarian society is that the state sanctifies what everybody knows is not true, even if they are legally compelled to act otherwise. Britain remains far from totalitarianism, but a society that arrests an 83-year-old retired vicar for holding a placard supporting non-violent direct action, and opposed to genocide, is firmly on an authoritarian pathway.This has been a long time in the making. When New Labour introduced anti-terrorism laws, opponents warned the legislation would be abused to persecute peaceful protesters. Indeed, then 83-year-old Holocaust survivor Walter Wolfgang was held under thePrevention of Terrorism Actafter he heckled the then foreign secretary, Jack Straw, over the Iraq war at the 2005 Labour party conference.While many commentators portrayed Boris Johnson as a hands-off libertarian, his government introduced legislation that allows police to ban virtually any protest, with the Policing Actpermitting actionagainst demonstrations deemed too noisy. You may well ask what sort of protest is not noisy.Alas, it should always have been obvious that authoritarianism pulses through the veins of the Labour faction underpinning Keir Starmer’s leadership.As former Labour MP– and indeed adviser to Tony Blair – Jon Cruddas once put it, this is “the most rightwing, illiberal faction in the party”. As anyone who has ever encountered these factionalists in person can testify, they are defined by a raw hatred of the left. Lobby groupscommitted to Israel, or withlinks to the defence industry, pushed for this sort of legislation, and the Labour top brass lapped it up.Met police arrest activists holding signs referring to Palestine ActionRead moreOnce a movement committed to non-violence has been designated as terrorists, then a Rubicon has been crossed. “Terrorism” has been emptied of any real meaning, and can be applied far more widely. Indeed, earlier this year,more than 70 peaceful protesterswere arrested at a demonstration organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC). None of this was direct action: they were deemed to have breached arbitrary restrictions by marching down Whitehall clutching flowers commemorating Palestine’s dead. The PSC leader, Ben Jamal, is among those being put on trial.Yes, the authoritarian descent predates the slaughter of Gaza. But we have certainly learned that the consequences of a state facilitating genocide will have profound consequences on society at home. Millions of people are aware that their government has facilitated a grave crime, and to protect themselves from scrutiny and accountability, the powers that be must silence those challenging the crime. Democracy becomes ever more imperilled.Remember: it is an offence to show support for Palestine Action, which is deemed legally equivalent to al-Qaida and IS. If that law is broken, prison awaits. The proscribed organisation promotes civil disobedience and non-violent direct action in protest at genocide. This column has been checked over with that in mind. Ask yourself if this is normal in a self-described democracy. Then ask yourself searching questions about where this is all headed.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Police have said no links between the incidents have been identified.While criminal charges have now been laid and the justice system must be allowed to take its course, to understand the impacts of these two separate events on Melbourne’s Jewish community, you first must understand what Fridays mean to us.It is the night where we welcome in Shabbat (the Sabbath), and the different expressions of how we do that are perfectly illustrated in both Miznon and the East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation.Sitting on the edge of Melbourne’s CBD, East Melbourne Synagogue is one of Melbourne’s oldest and most established congregations, practising ceremonies reflective of the Orthodox Jewish religion. Only a short distance away is the Israeli restaurant Miznon.Despite their differences, both institutions of the Jewish community reflect what is most important to us on that day of the week: being together.Last Friday night, as 20 members of the East Melbourne Synagogue community were gathered around the table for Shabbat dinner, police allege a man allegedly attempted to set the building they were in alight.And at Miznon, a protest allegedly turned violent. Protesters reportedly targeted the restaurant because it is part-owned by Israeli restaurateur Shahar Segal, who has served as a spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been widely condemned for how it distributes aid in Gaza. But I don’t believe what allegedly unfolded at Miznon was a legitimate peaceful protest. Patrons and staff were allegedly harassed. Furniture was allegedly thrown.Two separate incidents. Two very different spaces.Targeting East Melbourne Synagogue strikes fear to all who feel connected to their culture, community and way of life. Many will recognise this antisemitism from the darkest times in Jewish memory.But targeting Miznon also strikes fear for all who are proud of their culture, heritage, and background, and want to share it with their fellow Australians. It makes people question if their existence or where they were born diminishes their place in our country.There must be a space for legitimate criticism of the Israeli government, to voice the need for Gazans to receive aid, to end hostilities and work towards a lasting peace. But we cannot accept that any of that is achieved by causing further division here in Melbourne.Violence, pain and suffering is not a competition. And one of the most important things is to listen to different communities when they tell you what is impacting them.It is not up to those outside the Jewish community to tell us what is and isn’t antisemitism, or to define what makes us feel unsafe.At the same time, we must learn that two things can be true at once: that we can hold empathy for the unimaginable suffering of the Palestinian people, while caring for the safety of the Jewish community in Australia.That we can wish for the safe return of hostages to their families in Israel, while seeing that the rise of Islamophobia here at home is true as well.And in doing so, we must realise some things that are not true.One of these things that is not true is that by expressing concern for rising antisemitism in Australia you are endorsing violence in a conflict on the other side of the world.The reality is if the Jewish community doesn’t feel safe here in Australia, we are not the only ones.Other communities are watching. They are seeing what is happening to the Jewish community when we call out what is happening to us.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Each of us have a responsibility to look at what’s happening around us. And that starts with listening to affected communities.When my office was firebombed in June last year, it was an incident that we thought was as far as escalations could go.At the time I said I would have done it myself if it would bring peace to the Middle East. That point remains.How we confront these issues in Australia matters, and it too often descends into the opposite of the future we desperately want to realise.Despite the alleged attacks on the Jewish community, there are still places for us to find hope. And this was demonstrated by the response of the staff from Max, the Lebanese-owned restaurant neighbouring Miznon on Friday night.Standing in the doorway, it was the staff of Max who stood in front of Miznon and copped the brunt of the alleged abuse, hurling of tomatoes and the alleged smashing of the shop windows.Because for those of us who come from multicultural and multi-faith communities, we know that an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.And that the future should be one of respect, togetherness and sharing food, especially on a Friday night.Josh Burns is the federal member for MacnamaraExplore more on these topicsAntisemitismOpinionAustralian politicsMelbourneVictoriaJudaismcommentShareReuse this content"

This change in tone erodes trustTue 8 Jul 2025 20.58 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 02.18 EDTShareFollowing a spate of soft data, financial markets had priced in a near certainty that the Reserve Bank would cut interest rates this week – so it came as a shock to many when they chose to leave the official cash rate unchanged at 3.85%.As thetreasurer noted, the decision was “not the result millions of Australians were hoping for.” Mortgage holders can take heart, however, from the RBA governor’s words at the post-decision press conference, where she implied that a rate cut following the August meeting was pretty well in the bag. “The board decided to wait a few weeks” she told reporters, adding that the decision was aroundthe timing rather than directionof rates.Despite these assertions – and following the release of the May monthly inflation data – markets are not entirely convinced,pricing in an 85% chanceof a rate cut next month. To many, 85% may not seem that different from 100%. But in reality, it tells us a lot about how today’s announcement has unnerved markets.Confidence has given way to uncertainty and timidityWith all due respect to some of my economist colleagues, a decision to cut rates at a later date will not make a discernible difference to our economic fortunes – although obviously every week of higher rates is felt keenly by mortgaged households, especially younger ones with the highest levels of debt.What is possibly a more significant outcome from Tuesday’s decision is the erosion in trust of the RBA due to the large swings in tone between meetings, despite efforts to rebuild trust in the past six months or so.I wrotein this mastheadjust seven weeks ago that the RBA had adopted a surprisingly dovish tone for the first time in a long time, following the May monetary policy meeting. Indeed, the RBA acknowledged then that an out-sized 50 basis point cut had even been considered at that meeting (albeit briefly) following Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements.This stance represented a significant shift in attitude from the previous board meeting and indeed much of the previous year. And yet now, here they are swerving backwards.To me, this is quite confounding – and worrying.One of the reasons that a rate cut was widely expected this week was because the monthly inflation indicator for May had been softer than expected, both in headline and underlying terms. Underlying inflation, which is the measure that the RBA is focused on, dropped to just 2.4%, the lowest annual pace in more than three years. While these numbers are a little volatile and not a full picture, they provide enough evidence to show that inflation is not deviating from the RBA’s expectations, which would be the only justification to postpone another rate cut.Yet the RBA statementsaid thatinflation data for May was “at the margin, slightly stronger than expected” and that they will only feel confident once the June quarter data is out in black and white before their eyes. This makes one wonder how good the models are if there’s that level of uncertainty with two-thirds of the story already in the bag.The RBA also suggests that “private domestic demand appears to have been recovering gradually.” While I agree with the governor’s assertion that “reasonable people can differ in their interpretation of the data,” I think that, in this instance, the RBA has got it wrong. Consumer demand and confidence are unequivocally weak, despite tax cuts, lower inflation and two rate cuts, and wild gyrations in US tariff policy will continue to undermine business confidence and investment.We were told by the governor that there was “really good debate in the [RBA] boardroom,” but it’s hard to agree that recent data deserve such debate. In fact, given the level of downside risks created by uncertainty – especially as we face the next wave of crazy on tariffs from President Trump – the weighting to cut should have been easy if economic data was all that was under consideration.Yes, the labour market remains robust, with unemployment at 4.1%. And low productivity is producing unit labour cost growth at rates we’d prefer to see lower. But we are not seeing this translate into higher prices.RBA interest rates: Reserve Bank of Australia leaves cash rate on hold at 3.85%Read moreThe bank’s own liaison tells them businesses can’t do this under current soft conditions, but officials seem worried that another 25 basis point cut this month, as opposed to next, will threaten that, even as they forecast further rises in unemployment.The decision to hold rates passed by six votes to three. One has to assume that the three RBA board members voted to hold, so the six independent members were split 50-50. Despite reform of the RBA monetary policy decision-making board, officials still appear to have considerable sway over the final outcome.As I’ve noted, I don’t think it’s a calamity for the economy as a whole that we wait another month for an interest rate cut (although I would be deeply concerned if the cut flagged by the governor for the August meeting did not appear.) What does concern me about this latest decision is the significant swerving in language.One minute we are told inflation is in the bag; seven weeks later, we are worried that it’s not, despite the data strongly indicating otherwise and despite the potential impact of very high levels of uncertainty playing out, both internationally and at home, which is anathema to growth.Confidence has given way to uncertainty and timidity. The RBA will need to exercise caution in its communications in the lead-up to, and following, the next monetary policy meeting if it does not want to further undermine confidence in its decision-making ability.Nicki Hutley is a consulting economistExplore more on these topicsInterest ratesOpinionReserve Bank of AustraliaAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

Just look at Friends!Stuart HeritageWed 9 Jul 2025 09.02 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 11.16 EDTShareNow in its third season, it’s safe to say that HBO’s Sex and the City revivalAnd Just Like Thathas struggled to capture the zeitgeist in the same way as its mother series. But that all changes now because, in its most recent episode, shrugged off its tired old premise to become something new. Now it is nothing less than a show about the miracle of human reanimation.The most recent episode was entitled Silent Mode. In it, Nicole Ari Parker’s character Lisa learned that her 90-year-old father had died. As she prepared to deliver a moving eulogy, sharp-eyed And Just Like That loyalists were all grabbed by the same sudden thought: wait, hadn’t he already died once before?They remembered the premiere of the series, when the characters were still reeling from the sudden Peloton-adjacent death of Mr Big, and Lisa told Charlotte: “I was exactly the same when my father died last year.”Now, some have claimed that this is lazy writing; all the major aspects of a character’s life – like how many parents they have, and the general impossibility of corporeal resurrection – should be kept in a show bible that is referenced ahead of any major plot points. However, I think it is more likely that all the characters from And Just Like That are simply members of a satanic voodoo death cult driven by the secret desire to Frankenstein all their loved ones back to life in order to kill them again, so they can revel in the hideous truth that they have become more powerful than God.Frasier was the rare show that not only noticed the goof but actively leaned into itAlternatively, the first dead dad was her stepdad. That’s the line the And Just Like That writers have hastily thrown together in the wake of the mistake, at least. Lisa had a stepdad, and he died, then her actual dad died a couple of years later. Would it have been easier to understand if Lisa – a character whom we had known for seconds at that point – had said “stepdad” instead of “dad” in the premiere? Possibly. But it’s too late to go back and fix that now.At the very least, And Just Like That can reassure itself that it’s not the only show to have messed up like this. When you’re making a long-running series with a large cast, it’s only natural to expect that some details will get mixed up along the way.View image in fullscreenGood dad, bad dad … Kelsey Grammer with John Mahoney in Frasier.Photograph: Paramount/AllstarOne notorious example isFriends. In the very first episode, Monica introduces Rachel – at that point a runaway bride – to all her chums. One of them is Chandler, whom she appears to be meeting for the first time. But as the series wore on and started to introduce flashbacks, we saw that Rachel had met Chandler several times previously; once shortly after getting engaged to Barry and twice more at family Thanksgiving meals. And these were only the times we saw. Perhaps Rachel had met Chandler hundreds of times before the start of the first episode. Maybe even thousands. Maybe, with this in mind, Friends actually becomes a heartbreaking tale of a woman struggling with the debilitating effects of transient global amnesia.Something similar happened inFrasier. When Frasier Crane was simply a side character on Cheers, he once mentioned that his father had been a scientist, but was now dead. But then came the Frasier spin-off, in which one of the main characters was none other than Frasier’s dad, depicted not as a corpse in a lab coat but a gnarled retired policeman. However, Frasier was the rare show that not only noticed the goof but actively leaned into it. Martin Crane was always a police officer, it was explained, but Frasier had lied about him out of embarrassment. If people had known that his dad was a street cop and not a highfalutin academic, then Frasier’s painstakingly assembled self-image would have crumbled into a pile of ashes. A continuity error transformed into an opportunity to deepen a character. How very Frasier.Perhaps this is something that And Just Like That can also use. Forget the wishy-washy stepfather line: let’s make Lisa an inveterate liar, who repeatedly invents bereavements in order to gain the trust of those around her. Wouldn’t that be a far more interesting direction in which to take the character? Either that or the death cult thing, which would at least liven up the show a bit.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionFriendsAnd Just Like ThatFrasierfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In it, Rhian Teasdale sings about the pleasures of doing nothing over guitars that bend in and out of tune in the style patented by My Bloody Valentine. Nothing much happens in the song – there’s some discussion about possibly getting a takeaway, and a brief nod to the “happy comatose” effects of weed – but it does feature a few lines that function as a kind ofWet Legorigin story. “Maybe we could start a band as some kind of joke,” sings Teasdale. “Well, that didn’t quite go to plan … now we’ve been stretched across the world”.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Moisturizer.You don’t need to be a member of Wet Leg and aware of the circumstances of their formation – apparently the result of a conversation between Teasdale and guitarist Hester Chambers while on a ferris wheel – to feel slightly surprised at their continued success and how hotly anticipated their second album has turned out to be. Their breakthrough debut single Chaise Longue was a great song, but it carried a hint of the left-field novelty hit, the kind of funny-weird track that temporarily ignites indie disco dancefloors and festival audiences before it and its authors recede swiftly into memory: the latest addition to a pantheon that includes Electric Six’s Gay Bar, Liam Lynch’s United States of Whatever, and – one for readers of a certain age – the Sultans of Ping’s Where’s Me Jumper? But that wasn’t what happened at all.Wet Leg’s eponymous debut album turned out to be stuffed with both hooks of a kind you don’t really get in British alt-rock these days and witty, sharply-drawn vignettes of life among the provincial hipsters of the Isle of Wight – Wet Dream, which turned into an even bigger hit than Chaise Longue, cast a weary eye over a Vincent Gallo-obsessed letch. The album went gold in the UK, made the US Top 20 and won two Brits and two of the three Grammys it was nominated for.Something that was a “kind of joke” has ended up a remarkably big deal: at one juncture, Teasdale and Chambers became so weary of inquiries as to when their second album was coming out, they took to telling interviewers it was already finished, when they hadn’t started work on it. That said, Moisturizer does not seem much like the work of a band nervous about following up an unexpectedly huge debut. It’s a very confident record indeed, from the leering grin Teasdale sports on its cover, to the big, knowingly dumb garage rock riffs that gust through Catch These Fists and Pillow Talk, to the dramatic shift in its lyrics. The goings-on in Ryde’s indie crowd have been supplanted as chief subject matter. “Hello, 999, what’s your emergency / Well, the thing is … I’m in love,” gasps Teasdale on opener CPR, which pretty much sets the album’s tone. You hear an awful lot about her blossoming relationship with her partner, and indeed her surprise at the discovery her sexuality was more fluid than she previously thought, the latter expressed in questions sprinkled across the songs: “Is this fun? Is this a vibe?” “The fuck am I doing?” “Am I dreaming?” “What’s a guy like me to do?”Wet Leg: Catch These Fists – videoIt means that the kind of barbed put-downs that peppered their debut are thinner on the ground, although there’s a great one on Catch These Fists, a withering dismissal of a would-be suitor in a nightclub: “He don’t get puss, he get the boot / I saw him sipping on Dark Fruit.” And besides, you hardly want for smart, funny lyrics, their power amplified by Teasdale’s hugely expressive voice slipping from singing to speech, from careful enunciation to a chewy drawl, from snarl to wide-eyed gasp. Davina McCall channels a rush of lust through the Big Brother presenter’s catchphrase “I’m coming to get you”; Don’t Speak frames romance through the unlikely metaphor of tortilla chips: “You’re the sand between my toes … We go together like salsa and Doritos.”‘This weird dream just keeps going!’ Wet Leg on overnight success, sexual epiphanies and facing fearsRead moreMusically, it shifts from Pokemon’s synth-y 80s pop rock to the kind of Kate Bush-influenced balladry in which Teasdale dabbled when she was still a singer-songwriter who called herself Babushka Baba Yaga, on 11:21. But its primary currency is early 90s US alt-rock – the ghosts of Pixies, Belly and the Breeders haunt its lurching dynamic shifts and cocktails of sticky pop melodies and raging guitars – and, more unexpectedly, the angular riffs of Elastica, particularly pronounced on Pond Song and Catch These Fists.Indeed, Wet Leg’s influences are never far from the surface of their music and you could argue that all this amounts to yet more canny restructuring of the past in a genre that’s made recycling its business for the last 30 years. But it’s far harder to quibble with the power of the end result. Whatever’s inspired them, the songs are supremely punchy, the tunes contagious: Moisturizer is a blast. One suspects that, for Wet Leg, things will continue to not go quite to plan for some time yet.Moisturizer is released via Domino on 11 JulyExplore more on these topicsWet LegPop and rockIndiealbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s yet more evidence that we live in a terrible worldLucy ManganWed 9 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTShareWhat – and I ask myself this question with increasing frequency and seriousness – are we going to do about people? What, more specifically, are we going to do about the number of irredeemably wicked ones and the amount of suffering they bring into the world?If you can get through the two-part documentary Poisoned: Killer in the Post without sliding down on to the floor in despair as these questions thunder through your mind – well, you’re a better viewer than I.Poisoned is a meticulous chronicle of the equally meticulous investigation conducted by Times journalist James Beal into the identity of the online supplier of lethal chemicals to people who had congregated on a forum where they shared their suicidal thoughts, discussed methods and, often, plans for taking their own lives.Beal was alerted to the potential story by David Parfett in 2022. A year before, Parfett had lost his 22-year-old son, Tom, to suicide. “It’s just a different world after that.” Parfett had found the forum that Tom had posted on, posed as a new user, and soon found himself directed to a website that, hidden in plain sight among a variety of other goods either permanently sold out or astronomically priced (salt for $9,999 and so on), sold the poison to anyone who ordered it, with no registration requirements and no checks. Tom continued to post on the forum for a short while after he had taken the poison, about his racing heart, then creeping numbness. “That’s my son dying,” says David.Louise Nunn lost her daughter Immy in the same terrible way after years of supporting her through mental health crises that had led to her being sectioned. She took the poison a few hours after her latest release, about which her parents had not been informed; Dawn her stepson Adam – “He was so loved”; in Arizona, Malyn lost her brother, and Lynn her son, Miles. Like Parfett, they all tried to track down the responsible parties and interest the police in their findings and their growing certainty that one man was behind the distribution of potentially thousands of packages and deaths.Beal synthesises what they have learned with his own discoveries and finds the man behind the website. Pretending to be a customer with concerns about the efficacy of the product, we hear his extraordinary conversation with a Canadian chef called Kenneth Law, who cheerfully confirms for him that people “in the UK, US and Canada” and other countries have died from his supplies. “At least a dozen … I’ve been kept busy, yeah!”View image in fullscreenLouise Nunn, who lost her daughter Immy after she took the poison she bought online.Photograph: WonderhoodOn we go, covering Beal’s exposé after further investigations, which leads to Law being charged with 14 counts of first degree murder and 14 of counselling or aiding suicide in relation to Canadian deaths. Investigations into multiple deaths linked to him in other countries are ongoing, and the National Crime Agency is considering the possibility of extraditing him.Law has not been found guilty, and did not respond to the allegations made in the series. The documentary does not, I think refreshingly, dwell too long on Law’s possible motivations. Sociopathy? Psychopathy? Badness? Some unholy combination of the above? Would it help us to know? Can we protect ourselves against any of them? The more you hear, and the more technology facilitates the spread of the worst of humanity, the more unlikely it seems.Beneath the giant shadow cast by Law, however, are others. There are the failures of the police to link the deaths of people found with the same poison in their possession or who had been posting on the same forum. There seems to have been a readiness across forces to tick the box marked “suicide”, close the case and feel no wider sense of responsibility to prevent further harm. There is the lag between old laws (in the UK, around the sale of poisons, the requirements to report, what constitutes assisting suicide, and international compatibilities) and new technology. There is the widespread and ongoing failure of all sorts of authorities and corporate megaliths to monitor even the vilest, most dangerous tracts of the internet.Whatever happens, of course, it will not bring any of the beloved lost sons and daughters back to their stricken parents. It will not restore her brother to Malyn, or any of the untold number of victims whose deaths may ultimately be laid at Law’s door.

They proposed a floating multi-species utopia where humans and dolphins could mingle in a watery fantasy, communicating through telepathy. The triangular vessel featured a land-water living room, with chutes enabling dolphins to swim between floors, as well as a shared navigation pod, where one day an “electronic-fluidic interface” would allow both humans and dolphins to steer the ship. The hope was that technological advances would make the project buildable by the 1990s. “Thus far,” the article noted, “no backers have come forward.”View image in fullscreenPractical solutions … Alusta Pavilion by Suomi/Koivisto architects.Photograph: Maiju Suomi/Elina Koivisto/Courtesy of the The Design MuseumFifty years on, there is still no delphinid mission, but Ant Farm’s acid-induced drawings are on display in the Design Museum, as part of an exhibition about current designers’ attempts to work with and for the “more than human” world. Today’s young architects might no longer be communing with their animal clients through psychedelics (alas!), but a whole new generation is engaging with the natural world once again, in the realisation that it’s not enough to mitigate the human impact on the planet: we must actively design for other species to flourish.The resulting show is an intriguing, if sometimes opaque, foray into numerous experiments and “collaborations” with nature, from fungal facades to fabrics grown from grass roots. Some are realistic proposals that have been put into action, while (too many) others occupy the realms of fantasy or conceptual art. But a good deal of exhibits will make you think again, and contemplate your relationship with everything from spiders and seaweed, to wasps and worms.View image in fullscreen‘Nature-based infrastructure’ … 3D-printed coral reefs.Photograph: Alex Goad/Courtesy Reef Design LabArchitect Andrés Jaque, who recently sprayed aschool in Spainwith a globular coating of insect and fungi-friendly cork, is back with an even more wildlife-welcoming facade. His “transspecies rosette”, a sample of a new cladding system made of pulverised cork and natural resin, features deep clefts and niches to encourage life to take hold, while providing waterproof insulation for the building. Modernism might have led to a wipe-clean world of sleek, seamless surfaces (all that high-rise glass resulting inaccidental bird massacres), but Jaque’s work suggests that more-than-human-centric design could lead to much more interesting, knobbly kinds of architecture. Does a bio-gothic future await?View image in fullscreenKnobbly cladding … the ‘transspecies rosette’ by Andrés JaquePhotograph: Oliver WainwrightNearby, Kate Orff of landscape architecture firm Scape, presents her more pragmaticBird-Safe Building Guidelines, showing how the differences between human and avian vision could be turned to advantage. By applying films, glass can be made to look opaque to birds, while remaining transparent to humans. This simple measure could save a billion bird deaths a year, in the US alone.There are a handful of practical solutions like this scattered throughout the exhibition, but at several points in the show you feel like reminding the curators their remit is design, not art. There are a few too many space-filling installations, like Julia Lohmann’sKelp Council, which looks like a series of couture dresses fashioned from seaweed, dangling in a circle, set to a bubbling backdrop of oceanic sounds.“If we consider that all living things have their own needs and agency,” offers a caption, “we might ask: what does seaweed think of us?”Quoth the kelp: “Do better.”Other projects seem promising, until you realise they have yet to be tested in the real world. There is a reason so many designers gravitate towards the ethereal realms of installation art and “research”, of the kind that now fillsbiennales: it’s a lot easier to comment on a problem than solve it.The seaweed might be envious of a project around the corner, made in collaboration with its more primitive relative, red algae. Australian designer Jessie French has developed an organic algae-based vinyl as an alternative to synthetic window decals, contrasting the few weeks it takes for algae to grow with the many hundreds of years it takes for man-made plastics to decompose. The museum considered using it for the exhibition signage, but the carbon footprint of shipping it from Australia sadly put paid to that idea.View image in fullscreenNatural fibres … woven grass fabric by Diana Scherer.Photograph: Oliver WainwrightElsewhere there are some ingenious examples of “nature-based infrastructure”, from 3D-printed coral reefs and sea walls, full of little ridges and holes to encourage marine life, to floating breakwaters that mitigate storm surges, which are also designed as habitats for oysters. Indigenous wisdom gets a look-in too, with baskets woven by the Ye’kuana people of the Venezuelan Amazon, who ask the permission of the forest before using its products, and a film that highlights the Inga people of the Colombian Amazon and their hallucinogenic use of ayahuasca. Just like the Ant Farm collective, it sometimes takes a little something extra before we can fully communicate with our more-than-human cousins. An altered state might help the exhibition-goers, too.In the end, it is (perhaps appropriately) nature itself that steals the show. Each section begins with a group of historic artefacts in vitrines, including a beautiful collection of animal nests. Marvel at the grotto-like wood pulp habitat of the European wasp, or the dainty nest of a hummingbird, fashioned from antibacterial lichen and cobwebs for elasticity, or the tiny clay capsule of the solitary potter wasp, hanging from a branch. The female wasp sculpts these little pots from mud and saliva, before laying an egg inside and stocking it with provisions of paralysed caterpillars. Now there’s some more-than-human maternal cunning.More than Human is at theDesign Museum, London, from 11 July–5 October.Explore more on these topicsArt and designDesignAnimalsArchitectureInsectsExhibitionsWildlifereviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the simplest explanation of how a movie likeThe Old Guard 2, a sequel to a generally well-liked Netflix action movie released in 2020, can be released five years after its predecessor without including the courtesy of an actual ending.Now, technically speaking, especially by the cliffhanging standards established by Star Wars and Marvel, The Old Guard 2 does have an ending (which will be spoiled in short order for clarity’s sake, so don’t read on if you haven’t seen it and want to experience a more organic disappointment). Andy (Charlize Theron), a centuries-old warrior who has lost and subsequently regained her healing powers of near-immortality, fights her enemy Discord (Uma Thurman) to a draw – which allows Discord to escape with the other members of Andy’s immortal team, so she may steal their healing powers. This seems to set up a final rescue/confrontation for the final 30 minutes of the film. Instead, Andy and her once-estranged bestie Quỳnh (Veronica Ngô) resolve to save their comrades. As they enthusiastically run off to do so, the movie ends.The Old Guard 2 review – Charlize Theron’s delayed Netflix sequel is an incomplete messRead moreThis suddenness may strike some viewers as a mercy. (The Old Guard 2 is pretty bad well before it punts its climax to another movie.) Narratively, it does vaguely resemble The Empire Strikes Back - except that the bad guy who gets the upper hand was only introduced in this sequel. That means the new movie doesn’t quite offer the full reversal that Empire does in relation to Star Wars, where Darth Vader was defeated at the end only to return with more physical and emotional firepower in Empire. Still, the idea seems to be a similar sense of characters picking themselves up and fighting on as they charge toward The Old Guard 3.On a more practical level, there’s a bigger issue at play: The Old Guard 3 does not, at present, exist. It has not been shot or greenlit. Both of those things could happen quickly, but on the other hand, The Old Guard 2 took years to make it toNetflix. (It was shot back in 2022, put on post-production pause during a Netflix executive shift, and returned for additional shooting last year.) Greg Rucka, the comics creator who also co-wrote the screenplays for the first two movies, has talked about wanting to make a trilogy, and The Old Guard 2 certainly acts as if that’s the plan. But it’s entirely possible that the series could end here.Similarly, it’s possible that 28 Years Later, envisioned as a trilogy with one sequel already sequel completed and release-dated, could leave off its final movie. The first movie (which, confusingly, is also the third in its series) is a hit, but has also polarized audiences. This could make the already-shot sequel due in January drop-off hard, and therefore give Sony second thoughts about financing the third movie, which hasn’t officially been greenlit. If it doesn’t happen, will the series need to wait another 10 or 20 years to build up enough goodwill and demand for a continuation?The scenario of maximum terror or, depending on your perspective, hilarity is the Divergent series. A planned four-film series based on the popular YA novels kicked off with a hit in 2014. But after the third film took a steep 50% dive from its predecessor in the US, the series was abruptly curtailed. A decade earlier, the DVD market might have been enough reason to go ahead with the fourth film anyway; this was not the case by 2016. (The idea of a wrap-up feature for TV was discussed, and apparently dismissed by the movie’s stars.) So now there are still just three Divergent movies, the last one ends with almost no resolution, and the chances of anyone ever agreeing to revisit the material seem close to nil. (Even sadder/funnier, this was a particularly unforced error: the third book in a trilogy had been split into two movies, as was the cash-grab style at the time.)This is an inevitable side effect of treating movies as serialized entries in franchises that will last at least three entries, if not forever; it becomes easier and easier to defer an actual ending far off into the distance, into the realm of projects that may never actually come to pass. Obviously some teases can work wonders; that moment at the end ofBatman Beginswhere Jim Gordon presents Batman with the Joker playing card and audiences went legitimately nuts with anticipation is a studio executive’s dream. But that works a lot better when the preceding movie feels complete.And as deflating as it feels to watch a movie that feels like it’s holding back certain ideas or elements for a sequel that may or may not get made, it’s doubly so to watch a movie that flagrantly holds back its own story – not even for another two-hour installment to follow in a few months, but in a kind of weird ransom situation: give us enough money and you can see how it turns out! That’s been the subtext of the 28 Years Later interviews that mention how original star Cillian Murphy appears briefly in the already-made sequel, but would feature more heavily in the unmade threequel. Presumably Murphy’s prestige and the series’ name-brand recognition will be enough to get that movie going. But it’s entirely possible an Oscar winner will wind up teasing a nonexistent resolution.View image in fullscreenAlfie Williams and Ralph Fiennes in 28 Years Later.Photograph: Miya Mizuno/APTo be fair, in some ways these risky cliffhangers have been created in part by adhering to conventional wisdom about how to build a movie series. Fanboy types love to talk about the importance of a big franchise plan, pointing to the zig-zagging recent Star Wars sequel trilogy as the ultimate example of the peril that awaits moving forward without a blueprint.But sometimes – often? - not having a specific plan for a sequel, trilogy, or 10-movie cycle with three TV spinoffs is a secret weapon. Some of the best sequels of the century so far – The Dark Knight; Star Wars: The Last Jedi; Avatar: The Way of Water – have been made with full knowledge that a third movie would very likely (or in some cases definitely) follow, and contain plenty of possible threads for that next installment. Yet those examples also pointedly avoid getting specific with their set-up, and provide highly satisfying endings to the stories at hand, rather than teasing audiences with specific hints about what’s to come or directly deferring major story developments to some later date.For that matter, I’m not fully convinced that some go-to examples of great cliffhangers that were guaranteed to be resolved, such as Empire or Infinity War, are actually all that impressive, either, at least from a narrative perspective. Empire at least has a major revelation, that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker’s father, for the audience (and the character) to sit with, making the break before Return of the Jedi seem more necessary. Infinity War, though, is just a lengthy rev-up to a non-ending disguised as a downer – a setback for the heroes to wriggle out of (or what used to be called the three-quarters mark). A lot of fans seem to have loved it more than the actual resolution – just as many viewers often appear more interested in long-gap legacy sequels to movies where they’d often stopped attending the sequels years ago.At the very least, making movies without a franchise map beats having a plan that inevitably depends on outside forces – viewership, cast participation, the right executives staying enthused – to actually execute. Leaving a cliffhanger like the one that not-really-ends Old Guard 2 seems like a misguided expression of faith that the audience will be excited rather than enraged. But it may also be a way of sharing the corporate-induced stresses of film-making with the audience. Suddenly it’s not just the film-makers wondering how or if a movie’s story can be finished up properly, and whether a franchise will be considered profitable enough to carry on. Now it’s the viewer’s problem, too.Explore more on these topicsFilmNetflixCharlize TheronfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He paints in a white protective suit, photos reveal, as if paint was radioactive material or sewage. It’s a telling contrast with a real artist likeJenny Saville, who gets completely covered with paint like a naughty three-year-old, let alone Van Gogh, who ate the stuff.Sheeran isn’t claiming to be one of those artists – is he? He’s in it for fun and charity. And his paintings have more energy than you’d think from the prissy hazmat suit. He must have moved about a bit, flicking and pouring the fizzy greenish blues, hot orange, lime, mixing them as if making cocktails.‘It’s my creative outlet’ – Ed Sheeran turns to art in time off from touringRead moreBut there’s a problem. While he has successfully defeated plagiarism claims regarding his songs, he would have no defence from theJackson Pollockestate. His art is, let’s be polite, one big homage to the abstract expressionist painter who turned modern art on its head, showing that the body could see more than the mind with his hurled lines of flowing, tangled colours created in dance-like moves around horizontal canvases.Sheeran is right to love Pollock. But it’s cocksure and stupid to think you can reproduce his genius on your days off because, you know, it looks pretty easy. It wasn’t. This is where celebrity artists get it wrong: they think art is fun but art is suffering and madness. A Sheeran splash may ape a Pollock splash but there’s no feeling, no truth. Pollock put his inside self on canvas, luring you into a web of mental suffering and triumph.Abstract art like Sheeran’s gives all abstract art a bad name because it’s based on the dumb idea that doing your own is a breeze. I have more respect forRonnie WoodandBob Dylanwho attempt figurative paintings: you can mock but at least they take a risk in doing the kind of art people are quick to judge.Sheeran’s art is a slick con job. In painting his light, meaningless abstract concoctions, he avoids proper scrutiny and dips a toe into art without putting himself on the line. What a pro, even when he is an amateur.Explore more on these topicsEd SheeranPaintingJackson PollockArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Heartbreaking accusations that Moth has made up his illness have been made, leaving us devastated.”In a statement on her website, she said that the article was “grotesquely unfair, highly misleading and seeks to systematically pick apart my life”.Winn, 63, continued: “The Salt Path is about what happened to Moth and me, after we lost our home and found ourselves homeless on the headlands of the south-west.“It’s not about every event or moment in our lives, but rather about a capsule of time when our lives moved from a place of complete despair to a place of hope.“The journey held within those pages is one of salt and weather, of pain and possibility. And I can’t allow any more doubt to be cast on the validity of those memories, or the joy they have given so many.”In The Salt Path, the couple lose their house due to a bad business investment. But the Observer reported that the couple lost their home after an accusation that Winn had stolen thousands of pounds from her employer.It also said that it had spoken to medical experts who were sceptical about Moth having CBD, given his lack of acute symptoms and his apparent ability to reverse them.Winn’s publishing house,Penguin, said it “undertook all the necessary pre-publication due diligence”, including a contract with an author warranty about factual accuracy, and a legal read.It added: “Prior to the Observer inquiry, we had not received any concerns about the book’s content.”PSPA, a charity that supports people with CBD and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), said it had “terminated” its relationship with the couple after the Observer article.Winn had been scheduled to make numerous appearances this summer, performing with Saltlines, her collaboration with Gigspanner Big Band.

Her six novels and two short story collections include The Translator, Elsewhere, Home and, most recently, 2023’s River Spirit.“This comes as a complete and utter surprise,” said the writer on hearing the news. “For someone like me, a Muslim Sudanese immigrant who writes from a religious perspective probing the limits of secular tolerance, this recognition feels truly significant. It brings expansion and depth to the meaning of freedom of expression and whose stories get heard.”Aboulela was announced winner at English PEN’s summer party on Wednesday evening, where actors Khalid Abdalla and Amira Ghazalla read from her work. She will receive the award on 10 October at the British Library in London, where she will announce her choice of winner for the PEN Pinter Writer of Courage award, given to an author “active in defence of freedom of expression, often at great risk to their own safety and liberty”.Aboulela’s work “is marked by a commitment to make the lives and decisions of Muslim women central to her fiction, and to examine their struggles and pleasures with dignity,” said novelist Nadifa Mohamed, who judged this year’s prize alongside the poet and author Mona Arshi and the chair of English PEN, Ruth Borthwick. “In a world seemingly on fire, and with immense suffering unmarked and little mourned in Sudan, Gaza, and beyond, her writing is a balm, a shelter, and an inspiration.”Aboulela “offers us nuanced and rich perspectives on themes that are vital in our contemporary world: faith, migration, and displacement,” said Arshi.“She is not the first to write about the experience of migration, but Leila is a writer for this moment, and my hope is that with this prize her gorgeous books find new readers, and open our minds to other possibilities,” added Borthwick.Last year, Arundhati Roywon the prize, and selected the imprisoned British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah as Writer of Courage.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Wallace appears as a judge right up until the series finale.It was only at that point in production that Wallace stood aside, afterBBCNews said it had heard from 13 people alleging he had behaved inappropriately at work, including by making inappropriate sexual comments, on occasions over a 17-year period.Details of a report into his behaviour, commissioned by Banijay and overseen by the law firm Lewis Silkin, are expected to be published imminently.Meanwhile, BBC News says it has been approached by more than 50 further people with fresh claims about the presenter. They include allegations, denied by Wallace, of groping one co-worker and having pulled his trousers down in front of another.Wallace has admitted using inappropriate language but claims to have been cleared of “the most serious and sensational accusations made against me”.It now falls toTim Davie, the BBC’s director general, to make a decision over the series’ fate. Wallace’s presence throughout is understood to be significant enough that editing him out is not a realistic option.However, shelving the series entirely could be seen as disregarding the huge amount of work involved in putting the show together, on the part of the production team and the contestants. In the case of the latter, exposure onMasterChefhas frequently lead to life-changing opportunities.Last year’s series of MasterChef had already been shown in its entirety on BBC One by this point in the summer. Its first episode aired in April 2024, with the final broadcast in May.This was followed by new runs of Celebrity MasterChef and MasterChef: The Professionals, both of which also featured Wallace in a prominent role. In December,Grace Dent was announced as Wallace’s replacementfor the next celebrity series.View image in fullscreenThe next series of Celebrity MasterChef will be overseen by John Torode and Grace Dent.Photograph: BBC/PADavie’s dilemma comes hot on the heels of controversies around the BBC’s Glastonbury festival coverage andits decision not to show a documentary about medics in Gaza. His stewardship of the BBC began in 2020, andhis allies now fear it could be at risk.Last month,the BBC failed to end a Glastonbury livestreamthat showed the duo Bob Vylan leading the crowd in chants of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.Afterwards, Davie, who was at the festival on the evening of the performance, was given the full backing of the BBC board and its chair, Samir Shah.At the same time, the BBC was already facing criticism for not broadcasting the documentaryGaza: Doctors Under Attack, citing concern that it could create a “perception of partiality”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Because, first of all, they think … someone likeGregg Wallaceis extremely powerful, and therefore who’s going to listen to them?”Among the new allegations revealed by BBC News was a claim that Wallace took his trousers down in front of a woman in a dressing room. The woman, who worked on MasterChef between 2011 and 2013, described the alleged incident as “disgusting and predatory”. At the time, MasterChef was made by Shine, a company now owned by Banijay.A BBC spokesperson said: “Banijay UK instructed the law firm Lewis Silkin to run an investigation into allegations against Gregg Wallace. We are not going to comment until the investigation is complete and the findings are published.”Banijay also said it would not comment on the report until it was officially published.Explore more on these topicsGregg WallaceBBCMasterChefTim DavieSexual harassmentCelebrity MasterChefFood TVnewsShareReuse this content"

Like its predecessors, it is inspired by Agatha Christie murder mysteries butin 2023 Johnson said of the film: “The goal is to strike out in a completely new direction tonally and thematically”. While Craig is returning as Blanc, Johnson has assembled a new cast including Josh O’Connor, Glenn Close, Josh Brolin and Mila Kunis.No details of the film’s plot have been revealed, though both O’Connor and Brolin appear to be playing priests. The subtitle Wake Up Dead Man is, like the previous Knives Out film, a reference to pop music.

The writing and development stage of the third film was delayed by the writers’ strike in 2023, and it was shot in the UKin the summer of 2024.The London film festival screening is billed as an “international” premiere, meaning the film is to have a world premiere in North America, most likely at the Toronto film festival in September.

Set in the fictional Igbo village of Umuofia, the book explored how colonialism and cultural misunderstandings fissured traditional African societies. It was written as a counter to Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, which portrayedAfricaas a dark place.View image in fullscreenMen standing at the entrance to the festival village in traditional dress.Photograph: Centre for MemoriesIheanyi Igboko, the centre’s executive director, explained the festival’s significance. “Things Fall Apart is not just a book,” he said. “It is a mirror, a declaration of identity, and a provocation. It represents the Igbo worldview and African traditions – and still challenges us today.”Adichie’s presence was part of her book tour for her new novel Dream Count –her first in over a decade– which tells the story of four women grappling with questions around love and identity.Her speech focused on the preservation of the Igbo language, culture and identity – just as Achebe did with Things Fall Apart almost seven decades ago.View image in fullscreenChinua Achebe wrote Things Fall Apart, which explored how colonialism and cultural misunderstandings fissured traditional African societies, in 1958.Photograph: Craig Ruttle/APBetween 1967 and 1970, a brutal civil war fought between the government and the secessionist state of Biafra killed an estimated 1 million people, mostly in the south-east.Over the last decade, a separatist movement citing continued political and economic marginalisation in the region has turned increasingly violent. In the past four yearsmore than 700 people have been killedeither for defying the separatists’ weekly stay-at-home order every Monday or from clashes between the separatists and Nigerian security forces.“Let us wake up,” Adichie said. “We often speak of political marginalisation. While that exists, we must pause that conversation until we have cleaned our own house. We must unite. Unity doesn’t mean the absence of differences – it is the decision to come together despite them.”Adichie also lamented what she called a growing disregard for human life and the erosion of community values among Igbos. “Today, we hear grotesquely inhumane stories of people murdered in ritual practices for money,” she said. “It is important to note that the victims of this recent upsurge of barbarism are mostly women … In Igbo culture, nothing is more sacred than life itself [as] Things Fall Apart teaches us … we are participating in our own destruction.”The week-long festival, which began on 29 June, brought Achebe’s fictional world to life. Highlights included a reimagined Umuofia village, theatrical performances, dramatic readings, and a stunning appearance by the Ajofia masquerade – one of the novel’s powerful symbolic figures.View image in fullscreenA performer from the Ijele Renaissance Theatre in a meditative state during one of the plays at the festival.Photograph: Centre for MemoriesThe Things Fall Apart village had depictions of a shrine, huts, a yam barn, a waterfall, and men on guard at the entrance in traditional warrior attire holding spears, as in Umuofia in the book. Visitors were given palm wine in cups made from coconut shells as the Ijele Renaissance theatre group re-enacted a playground scene where the protagonist, Okonkwo, gained fame by defeating Amalinze the Cat in a fierce wrestling bout.James Ngwu Eze, an organiser, emphasised Enugu’s symbolic relevance to the book and the festival. “Achebe spent many productive years in the city and taught at the University of Nigeria Nsukka,” he said. “Enugu is also the cultural and political capital of Igboland and Things Fall Apart was set in the Igbo culture.”Present in the audience were dozens of writers, artists, students, actors, and scholars including the Nollywood veteran Nkem Owoh, who featured in a 13-part screen adaptation of Things Fall Apart in 1987.For many in attendance, especially the younger people, the festival was an awakening. Janeth Sule, a banker, described it as “a reminder to preserve culture and tell our stories”. John Tochukwu, an artist who crafted festival items such as lanterns and plates from coconut shells, said Achebe “helped us see who we are – not as people of darkness, but of dignity and tradition”.Explore more on these topicsChimamanda Ngozi AdichieAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Once the darling of the Emmys, The Bear initially called itself a comedy, despite not really having any jokes or levity or fun in it. And this was down to some bad maths about its duration. The Bear was a half-hour show, and sitcoms are half-hour shows, therefore The Bear must be a sitcom.The Bear is not a comedy and it’s time to stop pretending it isRead moreHowever, in its fourth season, The Bear was no longer a half-hour show. Of its 10 new episodes, none are less than 30 minutes long. True, one is 31 minutes and three more scrape in under 35 minutes. But one is 38 minutes long, two more stretch on for 40 or more, and one somehow manages to be one hour and 11 minutes long.Now, it’s important that we shouldn’t only pick on The Bear here. Plenty of shows are at it. Netflix’s new Lena Dunham series Too Much is equally elastic when it comes to runtimes, with episodes lasting anywhere between 31 and 56 minutes long. And then there’sStranger Things, which ballooned from an average runtime of 50.6 minutes in season one to 86.8 minutes in season four. And it’s only going to get worse. From all the chatter about the upcoming final season of Stranger Things, it sounds like you should reasonably expect to die of old age at some point before the end of episode four.In a way, this was to be expected. The death of scheduled linear television means that programmes no longer have to staunchly adhere to set runtimes. A sitcom no longer has to be exactly 22 minutes long, because it doesn’t have to duck out of the way for mandatory ad breaks and wrap up so that everyone can watch the news.At first, that was considered a good thing. For once, creativity got to trump commerce. Writers and producers were finally able to tell the stories they wanted to tell, with no concessions to be made to schedulers or advertisers. It meant that we, the viewers, were being gifted uncut, unfiltered access to the minds of the greatest storytellers known to man. What a treat.Except now it is starting to become increasingly apparent that the minds of the greatest storytellers known to man might benefit from the service of a good editor. Although they’re free to make episodes of any length they like, that almost universally means that they’re going to be longer, not shorter.This isn’t necessarily a good thing. There’s a reason why Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt started to suffer in quality as it went along. The first (best) season was initially made for NBC, and so it was tight and fast and broadcast-ready. Subsequent seasons were made forNetflixand, although episodes only gained about five minutes extra each, those five minutes were full of weaker jokes that would have almost certainly been cut for time. And that’s just five minutes. At least one new Stranger Things episode is rumoured to run over two and a half hours. It sounds absolutely exhausting.Especially if, like a lot of us, you’re quite time-poor. On an average evening, once dinner has been cooked and plates have been washed up and the children have finally been wrestled to bed, you might only have a maximum of two hours to watch everything you want to watch before you need to sleep. And with that in mind, it’s hard to see these extended runtimes as anything other than robbery. There are so many brilliant things to watch at the moment, but we can’t watch everything we planned because The Bear has decided to make a meandering, plot-free 70-minute wedding episode. Already I’m planning to carve up Stranger Things like a frozen meat raffle and dole it out in pieces over the course of a couple of months. It’s the only way I’ll survive it. Please, creators, I’m begging you to stop the bloat.It’s something that The Bear especially should remember. The greatest episode it ever made – the one that initially put it on the map as a force to be reckoned with – was Review, the penultimate episode of season one. Filmed in a single claustrophobic take, it was a masterpiece of escalating tension. And it was only 21 minutes long. Those 21 minutes contained more action, more character work, morestory, than this season’s 71-minute slogathon. This is the direction we should be heading in: tighter, less fatty, more exciting. Throughout season four, The Bear repeatedly cut to a sign reading “Every Second Counts”. It’s time it started taking its own advice.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe BearStranger ThingsLena DunhamNetflixUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Netflix’s mashup of Love is Blind, The Circle and The Voice certainly claims the latterRebecca NicholsonWed 9 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Wed 9 Jul 2025 11.55 EDTShareNetflix’s new series is the latest in a long line of TV shows attempting to talent-spot the next big pop phenomenon. It feels as if the format has been dormant for a while, its role as A&R taken over by social media aeons ago. The glory days of American Idol and The X Factor have passed, and while The Voice trundles steadily on, it has been many years since those on-screen machines churned out the stars they were once capable of creating.Building the Band aims to modernise the format by bolting on parts of other reality TV shows. Its wannabe singers perform to other singers, sight-unseen, who then decide whether they’d like to be in a band with each other, by pressing a button, and collecting “likes”. It is Love Is Blind meets The Circle meets The Voice, though mostly it is The Voice, replacing celebrity judges, in the early stages, with peers.Though he does not appear in the first batch of episodes, Liam Payne features as a guest judge further down the line, alongside Kelly Rowland and Nicole Scherzinger. Payne died, aged 31, last October, and this is his final project. There has been some backlash already, questioning whether the show should be released at all. Some have seen it as a ghoulish enterprise: it is easy to see how watching Payne return to the kind of reality show that made him a star, knowing where and how his story came to an end, would be uncomfortable. The show chooses to frame its release as a tribute. Presenter AJ McLean, of the Backstreet Boys, opens the series with a sincere acknowledgment of Payne’s “deep love for music”, acknowledging that they “never imagined we’d soon be saying goodbye to our friend”.As a reality show, it is fine, watchable, well-crafted, leaving sufficient cliffhangers to keep you pressing play, though its first four episodes do begin to feel a little drawn-out and repetitive. There are 50 singers, each in their own pods, or “sound booths”. Everyone auditions as an individual. Six bands will be formed, each having between three and five members. Everyone has a maximum of 10 likes, which they can use, Voice-like, by thumping a big button. If a singer gets fewer than five likes, they are out. If they run out of people who have liked them, because they have formed other bands, then they are also out. It is not as mathematically demanding as it sounds.All of the singers, or at least the ones we see performing, are professional-sounding and highly competent, in that belting-it-out, face-slappingly emotional, semi-strained sort of way. (As a point of contrast, watch old clips of Pop Idol or Pop Stars: The Rivals auditions on YouTube, if only to see how singing has evolved over the last 25 years. It’s the difference between a bicycle and a Maserati.) In these early stages, the critiques are left to the performers themselves, and mostly, they offer these with tact, rather than cruelty. There are none of the old “bad for comic effect” auditions here. The rejections, when they come, are swift, but heartfelt, and McLean is left to deliver the bad news.Eventually, as those who impress most move into their bands, they perform together for the first time, when they are able to see who they’ve chosen as bandmates. As with Love Is Blind, you can tell whether there is chemistry or not in an instant. It reminds me of the moment when people finally see above the knee on Naked Attraction. They say one thing, but their expressions say something else entirely.At the end of this first batch of episodes, there are hints of a more ruthless reality show beginning to emerge, not least because the winning band will walk away with half a million dollars. People make promises to each other that they are not sure they can keep. There is aRegina Georgecharacter, one of those “I’m not afraid of conflict” reality show staples. The bands live and work together, 24/7. The respectful peer-to-peer notes of the sound booths may not be the enduring mood of the series.I did question why Building the Band would choose to focus on groups, in an era of solo singer dominance, but perhaps it has been designed less for making stars, and more for the dramatic spectacle. Whether that revives the format, or simply shifts it into a more standardised reality TV lane, remains to be seen. Incidentally, I keep calling it “Breaking the Band”, mostly because of the early 00s show Making the Band, but I do wonder if there might be something more to the slip.Building the Band is on NetflixExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewReality TVreviewsShareReuse this content"

Deeply eccentric, staffed by the barely employable, and permanently teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, St Anne’s hangs on, against all the odds. And then, in 1984, Ida Campbell turns up on the doorstep, in possession of a full scholarship and rather a lot of baggage.Sixteen years old and already an outcast, Ida is in flight from her hapless mother, her foul-tempered sister, the small community in the Western Isles to which they have been transplanted, and the nameless scandal that has ruined their lives. St Anne’s is to be Ida’s salvation, but it soon dawns on her that the school might not be quite the refuge she had hoped for.The school’s buildings were constructed by a Victorian lunatic. Its principal, Miss Christie, is a dusty combination of cold war paranoiac and Edwardian governess, insisting both on regular drills in preparation for nuclear attack and the importance of girls wearing their hair up. The rest of the staff, from lugubrious bluestocking teacher Vera Clarke (Classics) to “Loopy Linda” the English mistress, are antique, creepy, despairing or all three.In Havoc, Waits mines the rich seam of girls’ school fiction to delirious and rewarding effectThe exception – and one of our narrative guides through the mayhem – is geography teacher Eleanor Alston, clinging to hope and sanity as she approaches 40 in the aftermath of a failed love affair. Into this stagnant pool of scholarship is dropped the replacement for the late Miss Hamilton (history, ancient), the meek but regrettably presentable Matthew Langfield, an improbable ex-Westminster schoolmaster and St Anne’s first and only male teacher, and ripples ensue.Ida’s fellow students, having largely been deposited by parents indifferent to the school’s underwhelming reputation and keen only not to be bothered with details, are a restless bunch, prone to smooches, cliques, gossip (Cindy Riley, in the works shed, with the groundsman?) and outbreaks of insubordination. They have their queen bee, Diane Fulbrook, the dazzling head girl with ambitions to be a police officer; and their bad fairy, Louise Adler (almost certainly some relation to Irene, Sherlock Holmes’s rival). Louise is the school’s only Jewish pupil and spoken of in whispers; she has pushed one girl out of a window and set another on fire at the Tea Cosy cafe, and Ida has barely learned of her existence when she is told that they will be roommates. Then Diane is taken ill with a progressive neurological disorder that defies medical investigation. When, one by one, her fellow students develop similar symptoms, and diagnoses from demonic possession and Soviet poisonings to mass hysteria begin to circulate, inevitably suspicion falls on the newest arrivals.In Havoc, Waits mines the rich seam of girls’ school fiction to delirious and rewarding effect. There are welcome echoes of St Trinian’s – the shade of Alastair Sim hovers over the staffroom, comforting and anarchic at once – and there is abundant Ealing comedy in the madcap chases through school corridors and machinations in the lighting gallery during the school play. Yet beneath the comedy lies a distinctly unsettling undertone: the girls experience a convincingly visceral terror that edges towards Shirley Jackson territory and gives their hysteria an extra dimension. This, along with a genuine unexpectedness in the characterisation and a lot of very funny dialogue, loosens things up and brings real originality to the game. Combined with excellent pacing, a plot so deliciously thick you could stand a spoon up in it, and the boldness required to splice a darker thread into the narrative, it all adds up to a thoroughly satisfying contribution to a happily capacious genre.Havoc by Rebecca Wait is published by Riverrun (£16.99).

It is about the country’s leaders’ addiction to rightwing Christian fundamentalism and US-style prayer breakfasts, a strident political mannerism linked to the fact that evangelical Christians make up an estimated 30% of the population; it is on their behalf that Brazil’s religious right, via its substantial bloc vote in Congress, has now created what amounts to a minority-rule theocracy.This movement was originally imported after the second world war through colossal enthusiasm for the ministry of Billy Graham, and it was covertly encouraged by the US government. The evangelists and their fellow travellers show a particular enthusiasm for the Book of Revelations, whose apocalyptic rhetoric is used to amplify and justify all manner of conspiracist, xenophobic screeching.The tone is set by televangelists like the always angry Pastor Silas Malafaia, interviewed at some length here; he is a man clearly thrilled and energised by his own national celebrity and wealth, though irritated by questioning about his private plane, whose value, he says, has depreciated from over a million dollars new to about $800,000. (Perhaps this means that the needle’s-eye that we’re squeezing the camel through has correspondingly increased in size by around 20%.) Malafaia is someone for whom an ear-splittingly shrill and boorish rant about gays and communists is a natural mode of communication.The Christian caucus helped deliver the fiercely reactionary, blandly self-satisfiedJair Bolsonaroto the Brazilian presidency in 2019, though Bolsonaro’s callous and incompetent handling of Covid probably sowed the seeds for quiet discontent with his posturing rule. But the film also shows that the Workers’ Party ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva – known universally as “Lula” – ran again for the presidency and was careful to court the evangelical vote. He won in 2022 – and Bolsonaro, in fine Trumpian style, refused to concede, encouraged a coup and incited his supporters to storm government buildings. (The film shows one of them actually taking a dump on an official desk.)Bolsonaro was finally discredited, although the history of extremism is littered with cases in which imprisonments, disgraces, prosecutions and the like are merely career-phase setbacks to be spun by partisans as “lawfare” oppression by the deep state.And what now – is Lula simply the Brazilian Biden, ageing and uninspiring? Will someone else be the second coming of the Brazilian far right – could it be the gruesome Pastor Malafaia himself perhaps? Or would he find the subsequent press scrutiny of all his personal dealings disagreeable?

Bringing the story for young adults to life on stage, Tinuke Craig’s zippy, large-scale production confronts the audience anew.This modern Romeo and Juliet remains one of the most striking tales written for teenagers. The production is well suited for schools, giving young people the language and imagery to talk about racism here and now. But adapted by Dominic Cooke in 2007 for the RSC, the choppy script favours faithfulness to the book over inventiveness in exploring its new form.The cast bursts with sometimes overstated energy. In Blackman’s thought experiment, white people are Noughts, like Callum (Noah Valentine), downtrodden and degraded. Black people are Crosses, like Sephy (Corinna Brown). Crosses hold the power. This is a world where schools are segregated, juries are all-Cross and plasters are by default dark brown.View image in fullscreenHarsh world … Alec Boaden (Jude) and Chanel Waddock (Lynette) in Noughts & Crosses.Photograph: Manuel HarlanStarting out in their mid-teens, open-hearted best friends Callum and Sephy are forced to grow up fast as they wade through the crushing racial and class structures that pin them in their opposing places. Brown is buoyant as Sephy, desperate to do the right thing, her eyes slowly opening to her own privilege. Valentine is eager and angry as Callum, hardening fast at the harshness of the world picking his family apart.As in the novel, the play tears through the busy plot. While the story squares up to suicide, sex and capital punishment, each moment is sped through to get to the next. Though Craig’s direction is punchy and clear, the emotional impact frequently feels pushed aside in order to move on to the next scene. Cooke’s excessive use of direct address repeatedly tells us everything we need to know, rather than letting us work anything out for ourselves.The fights, chases and continual narrative lurches means time whizzes by, racing towards the play’s harrowing end, where grief bursts across the stage. More than two decades on, Blackman’s story of forbidden love and constant injustice remains damningly relevant, holding a cracked mirror up to its audience. A guttural cry pierces the night sky. Loss follows loss, and only anger remains.At Regent’s Park Open Air theatre until 26 JulyExplore more on these topicsTheatreMalorie BlackmanRacereviewsShareReuse this content"

This yin-yang spectacle is a rare chance for fans to see the world’s most influential figures in rap and R&B in one night, and to bask in their chemistry as storied collaborators.Their sets weave together over three hours, welcoming us first into Lamar’s incisive (and enjoyably irritable) state-of-the-artform address, filmed austerely in black and white, before blossoming into full colour for SZA’s tactile songwriting about exes, bad habits and heart-leaping, interplanetary hope. The contrast is abrupt but high-energy, and when they overlap for duets, everything changes again: Lamar permits himself a broad grin asSZAcircles him, looking very much in charge, during the seductive back and forth of Luther.For Lamar, this tour is about narrative. He arrives on stage, pointedly in the driver’s seat of the black GNX from his latest album of the same name. An opening gambit speeds through Wacced Out Murals’ laundry list of betrayals by his peers, his arm fixed defensively across his chest; and a painfully abridged King Kunta, which swerves to a halt after its now decade-old Drake dig: “A rapper with a ghostwriter? What the fuck happened?” Chased by Element, on which he swears allegiance to his craft and, brilliantly, to making it “look sexy”, the sentiment is clear: he’s at the top of his game, and he’s pissed off by the lack of competition.View image in fullscreenYin and yang … SZA and Kendrick Lamar.Photograph: Cassidy MeyersLucky, then, that SZA is here to fight for Glasgow’s hearts and minds. Her fairy-grotto set feels like a different planet; dancers dressed as ants writhe as she drapes across the GNX, now covered in vines. Beaming, she gets a huge response to platinum singles such as Kill Bill and Broken Clocks – a woozily gorgeous, millennial take on 9 to 5’s work hustle – but it’s the grungy double-punch of Scorsese Baby Daddy and F2F that really ignites: dancers with electric guitars slide on their knees as she ad-libs with goosebump-inducing intensity.Her magic extends to surmounting the disappointing sound quality – overbearing reverb makes it a challenge to pick out Lamar’s intricacies, but somehow the echoes suit SZA, who sounds both raw and bracingly powerful.There are sightline issues too, with the stage’s wide runways forcing the crowd to the extreme left and right, making it almost impossible to see inside a central inset, but the atmosphere – like the near-constant pyrotechnics – remains heated. Lamar’s pulverising Drake diss Not Like Us shakes the stands and likely Hampden’s neighbouring tenements, the crowd roaring that viral “a-minooor” taunt.The set closes on Gloria, a gentle duet about a shared commitment to artistry: “I see you, you see me,” croons SZA. But it should have been All the Stars – when they teetered on two enormous risers for the Black Panther hit, separated by a sea of fans, it felt like a genuinely historic celebration of their individual achievements and the elevating power of their friendship.Kendrick Lamar and SZA:Grand National Touris in the UK and Europe until 9 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicKendrick LamarRapSZAHip-hopR&Blive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

As a nine-year-old I was taken up Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon) and told it was the best. Even in those days, it was a struggle to see much except the backs of other people. The following summer Scafell Pike got the same treatment and the next year we climbed Ben Nevis. I disagreed on all counts. For me, Thorpe Cloud in Dovedale was unbeatable, despite it being under a thousand feet tall. What convinced me was the diminutive Derbyshire peak’s shape: a proper pointy summit with clear space all around, plus grassy slopes that you could roll down. The champion trio could not compare.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.This panorama question is in my mind as I begin hiking up Slieve Donard, Northern Ireland’s highest peak (at 850 metres), but a mountain often forgotten by those listing their UK hiking achievements. And a proper peak it is too, with a great sweeping drop to the sea and loads of space all around, guaranteeing, I reckon, a view to beat its more famous rivals.Mourne Mountain views mapSlieve Donard’s relative obscurity outside of Northern Ireland is not difficult to understand. During the Troubles, visitor numbers plummeted and many locals gave up country walks. “We never went to the mountains,” one tells me, from Belfast, which is only an hour away to the north. “A road sign replaced with a sniper image is not very welcoming.”Since that tragic period, the Mourne Mountains have made a terrific comeback, appearing in several episodes as parts of Westeros (along with other locations in Northern Ireland) in theGame of ThronesTV series.View image in fullscreenThe 20-mile Mourne Wall was built in the early 20th century to keep sheep away from reservoirs supplying Belfast.Photograph: Matjaz Corel/AlamyI set off from the eastern side, at a spot called Bloody Bridge – named after a massacre in the 1641 rebellion – where there are crystal clear pools in the river before it tumbles into the sea. The path steadily racks up, passing through a quarry then reaching a saddle at over 500m, where a massive stone wall heads directly up the mountain. This is theMourne Wall, a 22-mile miracle of human labour, crossing a total of 15 peaks in the range. It was constructed between 1904 and 1922 to keep sheep out of the central Mournes, where several important reservoirs supplying Belfast were located. Now it’s the site of an annual race and a handy landmark on misty days. It’s also a stiff climb. I deliberately avoid checking the view: it’s going to be magnificent.Where else can you start by the sea, climb the highest peak, and finish four or five hours later with a sea dip?The maximum distance you can see from any peak can be roughly calculated by multiplying the square root of the height in metres by 3.57. That, however, is not necessarily the final answer. Distant peaks beyond the horizon will poke their tops up and variability in light refraction around the Earth means the maximum distance can sometimes be extended significantly. The official record for a ground-to-ground distance view is 300 miles, between two Argentinian mountains in 2023. My own record was a glimpse of Monte Cinto in Corsica from the Alpes-Maritimes, around 155 miles away.I pause on the climb, puffing a bit, and bang the numbers into my phone’s calculator. At 850m, Slieve Donard’s potential view distance is around 65 miles, which should mean that most elements of the British Isles are visible on a blue-sky day like this one.I reach the summit and climb over the Mourne Wall to stand next to the bronze age cairn. I look east. Nothing. No Scafell Pike or Yr Wyddfa, not one bit of Scotland, or the Isle of Man either. Sea haze, the curse of the hiker who didn’t get up early, is the problem, particularly frustrating on an otherwise clear day. Having said that, it is a fabulous summit, perched high above the rest of the Mournes, with superb views south and west over the whole of County Down and on into the Republic of Ireland.I come down via the Glen River, another sparkling stream that leads me right back into the town of Newcastle, where I go directly to the beach and dive in. The view might have failed, but where else can you start by the sea, climb the highest peak, and finish four or five hours later with a sea dip?View image in fullscreenSlieve Donard and Newcastle from Murlough Beach.Photograph: Wirestock/AlamyA quick change and I head for thePercy French Restaurantin theSlieve Donard Hotel. The front door, I’m told, has a Game of Thrones connection, but it’s really Percy French that intrigues me. An Irish songwriter and wit, French was one of those characters that light up their age. A contemporary of Oscar Wilde and WB Yeats, he regularly performed in Newcastle in the late 19th century and wrote the song The Mountains o’ Mourne,but never achieved much fame outside Ireland. There’s a bronze bust of the man on a side table, and I resolve to take one of his comic couplets as my motto in the quest for the finest panorama. “I’m not as bold as lions but I’m braver than a hen/And he that fights and runs away will live to fight again.”Next day my goal isSlieve Binnian, at 747m the third highest peak in the range, and arguably the most beautiful. It’s another blue sky, so I am hopeful for fine views.I have seen landscapes, notably in the Mourne Mountains that made me feel that a giant might raise his head over the next ridgeCS LewisThe track to the summit follows the Mourne Wall the entire distance (about two miles) and at the top I see why locals favour this peak: the summit and ridge are lined with stunning towers of granite, the Back Castles. I scramble up to the highest point. Sea haze. Loads of the stuff, a thick purple porridge all across the eastern horizon. Slieve Donard to the north-east is impressive and the panorama of the MourneMountainscould not be bettered, but I’ve missed that 360 once again.View image in fullscreenKevin Rushby on one of the Back Castles of Slieve Binnian.Photograph: Kevin RushbyI head down the coast to the town of Rostrevor, a place whose dramatic setting inspired the writer CS Lewis to dream up the world of Narnia. “I have seen landscapes,” he wrote, “notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge.” In theKilbroney Park, next to the town, there’s a good cafe,Synge and Byrne, and a Narnia trail. The town itself boasts a fine high street and some stalwart traditional pubs, one of which I choose for a post-panoramic failure pint.I ask the barman if the undertaker’s business next door is part of the pub. “It used to make the wakes easy to organise,” he laughs. “But it’s closed down now. Mind you, we kept plenty of ghosts. There’s one who throws things, but is rarely seen.” Like England, Scotland and Wales, I reflect.Next day is my last chance. The neighbour to my cottage advises on trying Knockchree, a hill of Thorpe Cloud dimensions at 306m. “It stands a bit separate and that makes for a lovely view.” Exactly what my nine-year-old self understood. But my calculator says capable of only a 37-mile range.Cuckoos and stonechats are calling as I make the climb through pine plantation then up heathland. At the summit I sit down. A magnificent panorama of fields and Mourne Mountains is spread all before me in vivid colour and the sea horizon is perfectly clear. I think I can make out the summit of Snaefell on the Isle of Man, a full 60 miles away, which is a triumph, but England, Scotland and Wales have certainly ceased to exist. There are, however, two ancient kingdoms within my grasp: Westeros and Narnia, and they will do.Accommodation was provided bySykes Holiday Cottages, which has various properties in theMournesarea, includingCarol Cottage, which sleeps up toeight, from £727 for three nights.Stena Lineferries sail to Belfasttwicedaily from Liverpool andsixtimes daily fromCairnryan(near Stranraer).

They’re wonderfully fragrant, and yield the essence of the broad bean’s familiar flavour without having to use the bean itself.Bean pod soup with herbsThis vibrant green soup is a quick, thrifty and deeply nourishing way to use an otherwise unwanted and unused ingredient. The pods offer a surprising depth of flavour, meaning you can reserve the beans themselves for another meal. You can also use finely minced broad bean pods in stews, risottos and sauces, both for a hidden boost of fibre and for that beloved and familiar green flavour.I often skip the traditional saute stage of soup- or stew-making, not just to save time and oil, but to keep the flavour (and colour) more vivid and fresh. As a busy dad of two, my approach to food is all about cooking slow food fast, simplifying recipes and creating shortcuts wherever possible, while still preparing whole foods from scratch.This soup is ready in just 10-12 minutes, from chopping board to bowl. The bean pods save waste, the white beans add body and protein, and the yoghurt and raw extra-virgin olive oil help create a rich, balanced soup packed with fibre, polyphenols and bright flavours.Serves2, generously150g broad bean pods(about five), beans saved for another use1 white onion, peeled and roughly sliced2-3 garlic cloves, unpeeled400g tin white beans, including their liquid20-40g herbs(mint, coriander, parsley), roughly chopped, including the stalks, plus a little extra to garnishJuice of½ lemon, plus the grated zest if it’s organic and unwaxed150gyoghurt, soya, goat’s or cow’s milk, or soft goat’s cheeseExtra-virgin olive oil, to serveStrip the stringy fibres from the sides of the empty broad bean pods by snapping the top and pulling down the length of each side of the pod. Chop the pods into roughly 5mm-wide pieces (this helps the fibrous skins blend to a puree) and place them in a saucepan with the onion, garlic, white beans and their liquid, and enough boiling water almost to cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for eight minutes.View image in fullscreenFind more than 6,000 recipes in the brilliant Feast app. Scan or clickherefor 30% off an annual subscription.Stir in the chopped soft herbs, Add the lemon juice (and grated zest, if using), and the yoghurt or soft goat’s cheese, and leave to cool (you don’t want the liquid to be hot when you blend it). Tip the lot into a high-speed jug blender, then blitz until completely smooth; check the soup for consistency, especially if using a lower-powered blender, and if need be strain it through a fine sieve, return it to a clean pan and reheat gently.Season to taste, ladle into bowls and serve hot topped with a swirl of extra yoghurt or cheese, a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil and the reserved chopped herbs.Explore more on these topicsFoodWaste notFood wasteVegetablesSoupSummer food and drinkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I use a 16cm-square baking tin.Prep5 minCook45 minMakes6-8 bars175g jumbo rolled oats125g dried apricots, roughly chopped50g pistachios1tbsp pumpkin seeds1tbsp sunflower seeds1tbsp sesame seeds1tbsp milled flax seeds1tsp ground cinnamonSalt75g coconut oil, or butter65g soft dark brown sugar60g tahini3tbsp honey, or maple syrup1 ripe banana, peeled and mashed1tsp vanilla extractHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, and line a small baking tin with greaseproof paper. Mix the oats, apricots, pistachios, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, flax seeds, cinnamon and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a large bowl.Melt the coconut oil in a small saucepan on a low heat, then stir in the brown sugar until that, too, melts. Take off the heat and stir in the tahini, honey, mashed banana and vanilla, then stir the warm ingredients into the dry ingredients until well combined.Press the oat mixture into the lined tin, then bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Remove and leave to cool completely before slicing into bars.Aubergine and barberry kukuView image in fullscreenThis uses aubergine, but courgette can easily be subbed in instead. It’s packed with the classic Iranian ingredients of saffron, turmeric and barberries – small, sharp, dried berries that add a wonderful tang; source them in larger supermarkets, Middle Eastern grocers or online. Kukus can be eaten with a salad, as part of a picnic or meze, or stuffed into pockets of pitta for a snack.Prep10 minCook50 minServes43 medium aubergines, peeled and cut into 3cm piecesVegetable oilSalt1 pinch saffron strands1 pinch sugar1 medium onion, peeled and chopped1 fat garlic clove, peeled and crushed6 large eggs½tsp ground turmeric½tsp ground cumin1tbsp plain flour1tsp lemon juice2tbsp barberries1 large handful coriander leaves, finely choppedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Spread the aubergines on a large baking sheet, drizzle with three tablespoons of oil, sprinkle with a teaspoon of salt and toss to coat. Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until completely soft, then remove and leave to cool.Meanwhile, grind the saffron and sugar in a mortar, add a tablespoon of just-boiled water and leave to steep for five minutes.Put two tablespoons of oil in a medium oven-safe pan on a medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for 15 minutes, or until soft and brown. Add the garlic, cook for two minutes more, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool.In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, saffron mixture, turmeric, cumin, flour, lemon juice and a half-teaspoon of salt, then fold in the barberries, coriander, roast aubergine pieces and fried onion.Pour two tablespoons of oil into the same pan on a medium heat. Tip in the kuku mixture, cover and cook for eight to 10 minutes, until just cooked through. You want it mostly set and puffing up a bit at the sides.Turn on the grill, then finish off the kuku under the grill until it is set and golden brown on top. Leave to cool to room temperature, then slice into thick triangles to serve.These recipes are edited extracts from Sabzi: Fresh Vegetarian Recipes for Every Day, by Yasmin Khan, published by Bloomsbury Publishing at £26.
