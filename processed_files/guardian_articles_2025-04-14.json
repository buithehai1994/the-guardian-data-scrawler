Economic security can no longer be an afterthought because some now investing in Britain are seeking more than profit from our nation – they are seeking power over our nation.”One Labour frontbencher added: “Serious supply-chain analysis, driven by security, is still lacking. We don’t do it enough or clearly enough and it should be the guiding analysis that drives our industrial strategy.”George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University, said: “We should be running the rule much more carefully over any inward investment coming from China.”The government has attempted to smooth over any friction with Beijing over what has happened at Scunthorpe in the last week.Downing Street on Monday said Jingye, the Beijing-based steelmaking conglomerate, had not “acted in good faith” after it emerged the company had been negotiating over a government bailout while also trying to sell raw supplies destined for the plant.View image in fullscreen‘Fiercely vigilant’: blast furnaces at British Steel’s Scunthorpe plant. Liam Byrne, the Labour MP who chairs the business select committee, said the UK must now be cautious over foreign investment into critical infrastructure.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/ReutersThat revelation prompted the government to pass anemergency lawover the weekend to give ministers the power to interfere in how the company is run – a power they have now used to pay for the raw supplies in question.Two shipments of coal and iron ore will be unloaded from vessels docked at Immingham, 30 miles to the east of Scunthorpe, on Tuesday, with another ship making its way to the UK.Ministers say the shipments will help keep the site’s two blast furnaces running without cooling down so much they cannot be restarted. They have not ruled out however having to clean one of the furnaces using a process known as a “salamander tap”, which would take it temporarily out of operation and could make it difficult to restart.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, said during a visit to Scunthorpe on Monday: “We’ve got the raw materials, they’ve been paid for, and we’re confident that the furnaces will continue to fire.”Despite government anger over Jingye’s actions, however, both No 10 and the Treasury said they believed this to have been a one-off issue with a private company rather than a sign of the broader risks of Chinese infrastructure investment.A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “We’re not aware of any deliberate acts of sabotage. But as the business sector, and I think the industry minister, said over the weekend, in the talks that we were engaging with the Chinese owners, it became clear that they wanted to shut the blast furnaces.“Obviously this relates to a commercial Chinese company, rather than a state-owned company.”James Murray, the Treasury minister, echoed that message, telling Times Radio: “We are open to [Chinese] investment, whilst being also open-eyed about saying that when there’s foreign involvement in critical infrastructure, whatever country that comes from, we need to make sure there is a high level of scrutiny.”He added: “I think it’s important to make clear that the actions of Jingye, of one company, don’t speak to the actions of all Chinese companies.”The government has made a major push to secure Chinese investment in key parts of British infrastructure, with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, both having made high-profile visits to China in recent months.Chinese investors already hold stakes in British water companies, airports and energy infrastructure, while the proposed nuclear power plant at Bradwell B in Essex is being developed in part by China General Nuclear Power.Douglas Alexander, the trade minister, has spent the last few days in China andHong Kong, though British officials would not say whether he discussed the situation at Scunthorpe.Downing Street said Alexander did raise the case of Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP who wasdenied entry to Hong Kong last week. But while Alexander expressed “deep concern” over the incident, the Hong Kong administration later put out a statement defending the decision, saying: “It is the duty of immigration officer to ask questions to ascertain that there is no doubt about the purpose of any visit.”Explore more on these topicsChinaForeign policyHong KongBritish SteelSteel industryInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The fight for a share of straitened household budgets is led by Asda, which is struggling to hold on to its position as the UK’s third largest chain.Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer, retail and leisure at KPMG, said the modest rate of sales growth as costs rise “means there are some retailers really struggling whilst others win, especially online”.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryConsumer spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

On 20 February, and then again on 14 March, she had a thoracotomy operation – a surgical procedure where the chest wall is opened.Upon the second surgery, her condition improved and the University College hospital at Westmoreland Street was planning to discharge her, the inquest heard. However, Davis went into cardiac arrest at 11.25pm on 23 March and was pronounced dead in the early hours of the morning on 24 March, after a failed resuscitation attempt.Wilcox said: “I am satisfied that the medical cause of death should be arrhythmic cardiac arrest and complications following left thoracotomies.“In my view, the stress of everything together has precipitated this arrhythmic cardiac arrest in a lady who was not known to have any previous arrhythmia problems.”According to Wilcox, Davis had achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder that results in dwarfism, which was “complicated by very severe spinal problems” requiring multiple surgeries from 2016.The coroner said: “In my view, if this compression hadn’t occurred, Ms Davis simply wouldn’t have been so unwell. She wouldn’t have needed two lots of major surgeries.”She commended the “excellent care” provided by the hospital, noting that it was “frankly heartbreaking” that the surgery itself was successful only for complications to arise and to cause her death.Upon her death last year, Samantha Davis wasdescribed by her husbandas “the greatest love of his life”. Speaking about his wife, he said: “She was a unique character, always seeing the sunny side of life. She had a wicked sense of humour and always laughed at my bad jokes.“Without Sammy, there would have been no Tenable quizshow, no Willow series. No Idiot Abroad series 3.”Warwick Davis said Samantha was his “most trusted confidante and an ardent supporter of everything I did in my career” and that having her by his side felt “like having a superpower”.He dedicated his Bafta film fellowship award to his wife during an emotional tribute at the ceremony in February.Additional reporting: PA MediaExplore more on these topicsUK newsCharitiesDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Some people told us they were scared to leave their accommodation, risking increased isolation, and others said they feared they’d be attacked walking down the street just because of the colour of their skin.”He added: “The climate of hostility has increased, especially on social media which played a key role in escalating tensions. Disinformation and racist rhetoric have surged, especially on platforms like X, with some of those who spoke to us reflecting they’d see hate within minutes of logging on to the website. More action needs to be taken by the UK government to stem the impact of disinformation and hate both online and offline.”The report also called for asylum seekers to have the right to work in any job if the Home Office has not processed their claim within six months, arguing that this would not only boost asylum seekers’ mental health but also increase tax revenue for the Treasury. The data is based oncalculations by the Institute of Economic and Social Research.According to the figures, allowing asylum seekers to work after six months would save the country £4.4bn in government expenditure, grow the economy by £1bn, increase tax revenue by £880m, reduce the mental health impacts of worklessness and destitution on asylum seekers, promote better integration, and reduce dependence on taxpayer support.The report warned that preventing asylum seekers from getting jobs was leading to “workless stagnation”. It echoes theLift The Bancampaign, a coalition of more than 300 charities, trades unions, businesses, faith groups and thinktanks, which have urged the government to allow asylum seekers to work in a broader range of industries.Under the current rules, only some asylum seekers who are qualified in shortage occupations can apply for jobs if their asylum claim has not been determined after a year. In practice this system bars many from working.Rowland added: “Giving asylum seekers the right to work is a no-brainer. Everyone – from asylum seekers, to businesses, to the government, to the NHS, to our communities – benefits when asylum seekers are given the ability to support themselves. The current system, which is both harmful and expensive, cannot continue as it is.”The foundation, which supports asylum seekers and refugees with their mental health, through programmes across the UK, also highlighted in the report the acute poverty faced by asylum seekers who sometimes have to make a choice between skipping meals or paying the bus fare for a vital appointment.Some felt the words “asylum seeker” stigmatised them. One child told researchers she hid the fact that she was an asylum seeker from her school friends for fear of being excluded by them if she told them about her immigration status.A Home Office spokesperson said: “While the wellbeing of those in the asylum system is important, we remain determined to continue cracking down on anyone working illegally in the UK, and we certainly have no intention of creating a fast-track process so that people who come to the UK outside the established work visa rules are simply allowed to ignore them.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthImmigration and asylumHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The Silicon Six’s corporate income tax contributions are, in percentage terms, way below what sectors such as banking and energy are paying in many parts of the world.”Monaghan pointed to “aggressive tax practices” such as the contingency tax positions, while the companies also exerted “enormous political influence as well as economic power”, spending millions of dollars on lobbying governments.The report comes as the US tech companies’ influence has been highlighted by thepresence of their bossesincluding Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at Donald Trump’s second inauguration.A significant tax cutfor such companies has reportedly been at the heart of discussions with the UK in its attempts to secure lower tariffs on its products exported to the US.Monaghan said that much of the Silicon Six’s overseas revenue was subject to low-level rates of corporate income tax in the US via a tax break for foreign-derived intangible income. FTF said overseas sales were also subject to lower rates of income tax because of a combination of lower profit margins and booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions.Netflix had the lowest rate of tax actually paid compared with profit booked, at 14.7%, while Microsoft paid 20.4%. FTF said Amazon had the worst tax conduct based on the factors such as the total amount of tax paid and “obvious profit shifting” – such asbooking a sizeable portion of its UK incomein low-tax Luxembourg. However, Amazon’s corporate tax rate was 19.6%, well ahead of Netflix, Meta (15.4%) and Apple (18.4%).A spokesperson forAmazonsaid its UK retail revenues, associated expenses, profits and taxes were recorded in the UK, and reported and paid directly to HM Revenue and Customs.They said: “Governments write the tax laws and Amazon is doing the very thing these laws encourage companies to do – paying all taxes due while also investing billions in creating jobs and infrastructure. Since 2010, we have invested more than $1.2tn in the US and over €250bn [£215bn] in Europe. Coupled with low margins, this investment will naturally result in a lower cash tax rate, particularly when measured as a percentage of revenue.”A spokesperson forMetasaid: “We follow international and local tax rules, ensuring that we pay all taxes required in each of the countries where we operate.”ANetflixspokesperson said: “Governments determine tax rules and rates – and companies comply with them. Netflix complies with the relevant tax rules and regulations in every country in which we operate.”Microsoft,Alphabetand Apple were all approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS taxationTax avoidanceAmazonMetaAlphabetAppleMicrosoftnewsShareReuse this content"

He defrauded the government out of £911,677, keeping £557,093 for himself, the court was told.The defendant, who was dismissed from the armed forces in January 2016 after he was convicted and sentenced on four counts of sexual activity with a child, used his joint personal administration (JPA) account, a system the UK armed forces used to pay staff salaries and process expenses, to make fraudulent claims.Five other military clerks who were also employed at the Regent’s Park barracks – Roger Clerice, 28; Allan O’Neil, 48; Lee Richards, 41; Anthony Sharwood, 38; and Peter Wilson, 55 – appeared in court alongside Stelmach-Purdie after they were convicted over charges of money laundering and conspiracy to commit fraud.The prosecutor, Dominic Connolly, told the court: “These defendants, who were all employed at the Regent’s Park barracks, made a series of fictitious claims to expenses and allowances that they were not entitled to. As a result of these frauds, there has been a loss of public funds totalling £911,677.66.“These are public funds that had been demarcated for the defence of the realm and the protection of its armed services.”Stelmach-Purdie was responsible for the management of claims for expenses and allowances, and used his JPA account and the accounts of others. He then used the bank accounts of third parties, including his mother and sister, to conceal the proceeds of the fraud, the court heard.According to prosecutors, he approached the other defendants in December 2014 or shortly after, when he claimed he had found a way to “make some money manipulating JPA”. There were 161 fraudulent claims altogether, the court was told.Clerice, who was Stelmach-Purdie’s line manager, worked as a sergeant in the department and was described as a “specialist in administration”. He received £7,691 from the fraud and later pleaded guilty to money laundering.Richards, a former lance sergeant from Amesbury in Wiltshire, was convicted by a jury of 103 fraudulent claims made between March 2015 and January 2016, totalling £434,825. He retained about £160,000 of that sum, the court heard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He intends to lodge objections to the plans.Mathrani is also sure that the royal family would be unhappy to hear what is being done in their name to a restaurant long regarded as the grand dame of British-Indian food.He said: “They believe in history, in living history, and that’s what this restaurant is. It’s not just a museum, and I think they would be disappointed that an institution bearing their name would be so heartless.”At lunchtime on Monday, diners waxed lyrical about the restaurant’s heritage and current menu, which includes classics such as patiala shahi raan en croute, a Welsh lamb shank slow-cooked for six hours before being wrapped in pastry and grilled in a tandoor.The same menu includes photos of its historical equivalents, which included wartime offerings of lobster mayonnaise, jugged hare and sherry trifle. While the fare has evolved and sought to keep pace with modern British-Indian cooking, celebrity guests have remained constant.One diner said: “It’s just a really lovely place and for as long as I can remember there’s always been a sort of excitement about it. It was a few years ago but I can remember coming here and the Prince of Wales was in another part of the restaurant. They had curtains drawn but there was a buzz.”Established in 1926 by Edward Palmer, the great-grandson of the first governor general of India’s private secretary and a north Indian Moghul princess, the restaurant was intended to “educate” Londoners about Indian food decades before the era of celebrity chefs. It was sold in 1934 to an MP, Sir William Steward, who made it a fashionable rendezvous among royalty and British elites returning from India.View image in fullscreenButlers and kitchen staff at Veeraswamy in 1927.Photograph: ShutterstockAfter a period of decline in the 1980s, it was bought by Mathrani and Namita Panjabi, who poured resources into recreating its past glories. In 2008, the restaurant catered for a function held by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and it was invited back to launch the UK-India 2017 Year of Culture. In 2016, it was awarded a Michelin star.Nevertheless, modern commercial motivations are now a factor in its future. The crown estate, the royals’ ancient portfolio of land and property across England and Wales, wants to take back the restaurant because it plans to extend a ground-floor reception area for offices upstairs in the building that houses Veeraswamy. Knocking into the restaurants’s entrance area, where a uniformed usher greets visitors, would give an extra 11 sq metres.The crown estate said in a statement issued this week that it needed to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House.“This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible,” it added. “Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsHospitality industryFoodIndian food and drinkLondonReal estateMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

The vice-president ended the Ohio State football team’s visit to the White House by fumbling the team’s national championship trophy.After laudatory speeches by Donald Trump, Buckeyes coach Ryan Day and Vance on the South Lawn, the Vance – an Ohio State graduate – tried to lift the trophy. He didn’t appear to realize that the top of the trophy is detachable from its base. After a moment of struggle, the vice-president lost his grip on the two pieces. OSU running back TreVeyon Henderson, standing behind Vance, grabbed the football-shaped top of the trophy, but the base fell to the ground, forcing Vance to grasp around as it rolled away from him.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

However, during Trump’s first term several teams were not invited or made it clear they would not attend if they were. Those teams included theNBA’s Golden State Warriors, and the United States women’s national teamafter their victoryat the 2019 Women’s World Cup.Teams have been more willing to engage with the White House during Trump’s second term though.

And so it is, on a much smaller scale, that yet another UK government is doing several contradictory things at once when it comes to Beijing.This weekend brought a particularly resonant example. On the one hand, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds,was hintingthat British Steel’s Chinese owner, Jingye, was to blame for neglect – if not worse – over the fate of the threatened blast furnaces at Scunthorpe.Yet at the same time one of Reynolds’s own ministers, Douglas Alexander,was attendinga major consumer goods fair in Hainan, the tropical island on China’s southern tip, before holding trade-linked talks in Hong Kong, a visit that was not promoted in advance.Alexander was forced to mix some tougher politics with the trade, relaying what was termed “deep concern” at China’sdecision to barthe Liberal Democrat MP Wera Hobhouse from visiting her son and infant grandson in Hong Kong last week.For all that Foreign Office officials always insist that nothing fundamentally changes in the UK’s efforts to deal withChina, with endless talk of strategic decisions based on national self-interest, the reality is that the approach does very much vary by government, and not necessarily just when the ruling party switches.The most regularly highlighted contrast came under the Conservatives, when the “golden era” of Sino-UK ties, exemplified by David Cameron’scosy pub pintwith Xi Jinping, became notably more sceptical and even, during Liz Truss’s brief tenure, openly hostile.The stance taken by Labour governments has tended to be more consistent overall, but with a notable difference between the Blair-Brown era and that of Keir Starmer – and with the very obvious caveat that a lot changed in world affairs between 2010 and 2024.When Tony Blair took office, China was the world’s seventh-biggest economy and still four years away from joining the World Trade Organization, a move that led to an acceleration of the country’s already stellar rate of economic growth.View image in fullscreenExpanding trade was on the agenda in 2005 when Gordon Brown, the then UK chancellor, met the Chinese finance minister, Jin Renqing, in Beijing.Photograph: Jason Lee/ReutersThe period was thus – not unexpectedly – based around expanding trade with this new behemoth, a mood exemplified by a 2005 visit to Beijing and Shanghai by Gordon Brown in which the then chancellor marvelled at high-speed Maglev trains and personally gave every travelling journalist a book detailing this ongoing economic miracle.In retrospect, this approach, taken on by Cameron, risked the UK ignoring the parallel rise in China’s national security efforts. A2023 reportby the Commons intelligence and security committee castigated successive governments for allowing Beijing to invest heavily in vital UK infrastructure and gain influence by means as varied as spying and involvement in universities.Whether or not Jingye’s 2020decision to buythe stricken British Steel formed part of a Bejing-hatched strategic plan might never be known. But at the very least, the purchase of part of a totemic industry that once employed about 300,000 Britons by a company formed in 1988 in the heavily industrialised Chinese province of Hebei is a very tangible sign of how the global economy has changed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But at the same time, as shown by the Jingye saga and Hobhouse’s plight, such efforts are never straightforward when Beijing is involved.Much more significant, and with the UK as a bit-part player, Trump’s US has begun a seeming fight to the death with China on tariffs, one that has not ended with the US president’s decision to exempt many electronic goods.With the globe reeling from Trump’s tactics and mistrustful of the US, China is ready to step in. The UK will be more wary than some. But yet again, it will be resigned to adjusting policy on the hoof.Explore more on these topicsForeign policyInternational tradeChinaBritish SteelGlobal economyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The second season is slower and narrower in scope, but it is just as gutsy and thoughtfulJack SealeMon 14 Apr 2025 17.15 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 18.23 EDTShareSeason one of The Last of Us was a lot. It must have surprised some viewers to find that an adaptation of a video game was among the best dramas of 2023 – although it wasn’t too unexpected for anyone who noticed that it was co-created by Craig Mazin, writer ofthe magnificent Chernobyl. More to the point, The Last of Us was relentless, constantly shifting and weaving to deliver devastation and heartbreak in brutal new ways. On its return for a second season, it has earned the right to take a breath and slow down.A quick recap. A fungus-based pandemic has splintered civilisation as we know it, turning the millions of “infected” into groaning, lurching sub-humans who are not undead but are still monsters whose only impulse is to bite the healthy. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a man whose 14-year-old daughter died at the start of the outbreak 20 years ago, has travelled from Massachusetts to Wyoming with Ellie (Bella Ramsey), who was also 14 when they met and is one of the very few who are immune to the fungal lurgy. Season one’s cross-country odyssey ended with the conclusion of Joel’s quest to deliver Ellie to a resistance group who were working on a cure; when he realised the procedure would involve experimenting on Ellie’s brain, sacrificing her for the good of humanity, he killed everyone in the building to save his adopted child.Five years later we are with Joel and Ellie in the walled city of Jackson, Wyoming, where the snow is crisp, the houses have a comforting frontier-chic vibe and the infected are merely dots on the horizon, shot at by Ellie with a long-range rifle as part of the training that will make her a responsible adult. But aside from some roots found inside an old clay pipe running through the town – be careful with those, guys! – the only looming threat for Joel is Ellie herself, or more specifically her moods.View image in fullscreenWeary self-pity … Joel (Pedro Pascal) in The Last of Us.Photograph: HBOEllie is difficult in a way that can’t fully be explained by the collapse of society and the conversion of her future into nothing more than grim survival. The real problem is that she is 19 years old. Joel has the grey jowls and weary self-pity of a single dad who is reaching the end of some taxing teenage years and is facing the prospect of being left alone, befuddled and, as he sees it, unthanked, with nothing to show for years of selfless toil.While we wait for the infected to attack, not to mention the arrival of Kaitlyn Dever as the vengeful daughter of one of the scientists Joel selfishly gunned down, we are sustained by these family dynamics. The series has always made the most of being set in a world where progress was halted before the digital age could begin, and now its portrait of door-slamming teen rebellion has Ellie living separately from Joel in his garage, blasting early Nirvana deep cuts on cassette, fiddling with pistols and drafting unwise schemes.Joel, meanwhile, is in therapy, grumbling to Gail, the town shrink (Catherine O’Hara, hurrah), in a session that takes a turn when she mentions that he killed her husband, which in the Before Times might have been a notable conflict of interest. It’s one of several issues brought up in episode one that will be fleshed out later on by season two’s tricksy temporal leaps.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s all about Ellie becoming her own person, which happily means a lot more of Ramsey’s wonderfully punchy portrayal of a damaged young soul fighting for autonomy. Over the course of the season, Ellie’s wilfulness will push our patience to breaking point, almost making her unlikably annoying – when she charges towards certain death for the 20th time, it’s hard not to think grouchy old Joel might have had a point. For now, though, her refusal to be told anything by any adult is a hoot.As Ramsey assumes the responsibility of becoming the main character, that performance isneatly offset by the introduction of Isabela Merced as Dina, Ellie’s best friend in Jackson. Popular and positive in contrast to Ellie’s cynical introspection, Dina is sympathetic to her pal’s plight as almost the only lesbian in the village, and slower than us to realise how Ellie might like the status of their relationship to change. The pair are destined to leave Jackson and make a large number of mistakes as they find their way in a hostile world. Helplessly watching them can be agony, but sinceThe Last of Usis still such a gutsy and thoughtful rendering of humans on the edge, it’s no hardship.The Last of Us aired on Sky Atlantic and is available on Now in the UK and on Max in Australia.Explore more on these topicsThe Last of UsTV reviewBella RamseyPedro PascalTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Step aside, George Best. McIlroy’s Masters triumph may even force Sports Personality of the Year to afford due recognition to golf. It is only April but it feels highly unlikely the scene immediatelyafter McIlroy claimed the Masterson Sunday will be matched. His pounding of the turf; his tears absorbed more than a decade of such deep frustration. The moment reverberated beyond sport; Rory had done it. Grown men, lots of them, shed tears on his behalf as he broke his Augusta hoodoo.Nick Faldo six, Rory McIlroy five. Were this a football match, Faldo would be the winner. Yet in golf there is nuance. McIlroy might trail Faldo’s overall majors haul – for now – but the completion of the career grand slam pressed home new status for McIlroy. No European had secured the set before. He is the finest golfer this continent has produced.Faldo was the grinder who got the job done. There were, of course, stunning moments. The Englishman’s takedown of Greg Norman in the 1996 Masters represented true sporting theatre. It is a statistical oddity that Faldo had just three Masters top 10s, all victories. McIlroy is the natural artist, the people’s champion who in the latest Masters edition proved that he has a game to pass every exam. Differing course conditions are the standard reference point for McIlroy’s earlier major glories. This one was all about the state of his mind.Resilience won McIlroy’s Mastersfar more than panache. His biggest opponent sat between his ears.View image in fullscreenNick Faldo, on his way to winning his third Masters title in 1996.Photograph: Stephen Munday/Getty ImagesMcIlroy has scope to press home the European point. When partying from Augusta eventually subsides – and he is entitled to do as much of that as he wants – there will be competitive refocus. McIlroy has spent more than a decade chasing his grand slam. At times, it looked like it consumed him. Now, in his own words, “free” from that burden, he could be a seriously dangerous animal. The US PGA Championship takes place next month at Quail Hollow, where McIlroy has a formidable record.There wastrauma at Royal Portrushin 2019 but the Open Championship’s return this summer offers McIlroy a platform to settle a score at a venue he has known since childhood. He will naturally target Faldo and the half‑dozen when, still aged just 35, he has a decent window to endorse his greatness with a much bigger major tally. “This will take the world off his shoulders and I think you’ll see a lot more great golf out of Rory McIlroy,” said Jack Nicklaus, the 18-time major winner. Nicklaus has not lost his touch; he tipped McIlroy to win the Masters on Thursday morning.McIlroy’s competitive longevity does not get sufficient credit. A glance at the world golf rankings from the end of 2014, when he last won two majors, leads you to ponder “whatever happened to … ” time and again. Justin Rose,who came so closeto shattering McIlroy’s dream, is notable at No 6.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In winning the Masters, McIlroy routinely used escapism of which Ballesteros would have been proud. Ballesteros won four of his majors inside five years and all of them inside nine. He never looked capable of winning a US Open, which like the US PGA Championship duly eluded him. McIlroy is Seve Plus.There will be shouts for Harry Vardon in this conversation. The man from Jersey won the Open six times and lifted the US Open trophy in 1900. Vardon’s grip was a huge contribution to golf. It feels impossible, though, to compare the sport Vardon was involved in – niblicks, jiggers et al – to the scene of today. Vardon never broke 70 with his Gutta-Percha in those half‑dozen Open triumphs (in his defence, he did not have to). The competitive strength of golf in this era is as never before.McIlroy’s influence on golf has been huge. He has drawn people towards it, including as a properly athletic pursuit. His willingness to speak so openly, so candidly and so often adds to his appeal. He has also been statesmanlike in the game at a time when it has beenpulled apart by civil war. He never needed to do that, in fact perhaps wishes he did not, but it came naturally. McIlroy’s voice is a sane one. He feels responsibility to use it.Sunday at the Masters was no time for vocal engagement. Bryson DeChambeau could not handle McIlroy’s Masters charge, the American later raising, in slightly snippy terms, the fact the champion did not speak to him mid-round. If DeChambeau wants small talk, he should head to a coffee morning.McIlroy’s working‑class upbringing, with his mother combining several jobs, adds to this fairytale. Nothing came easily in Holywood. Mention the theory of God-given talent and McIlroy recoils; he has worked, worked and worked for everything in this sport. Harry Diamond, McIlroy’s caddie, is a lifelong best friend who has been unfairly castigated as majors slipped through fingers. Diamond deliberately shuns the limelight when his role in McIlroy’s ongoing achievement should be recognised.Luke Donald, McIlroy’s neighbour in Florida, will take great delight in the Masters outcome. One of umpteen strandsassociated with McIlroy’s playoff winis that it took place in a Ryder Cup year. Come September and Bethpage, Donald will be calling upon a McIlroy still riding his Augusta wave.McIlroy needed a Masters win to shift his own psychological status. This was the plot twist of all plot twists. It was, furthermore, a reminder to enjoy him while he lasts. McIlroy, the generational talent, has no European peer.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyThe MastersGolfEuropean TourPGA TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My wife has been printing more pictures all morning,” said Graham McMorris, a co-owner of Skinners bakery, which had already sold several hundred Rory biscuits – a concoction of butter, sugar, flour, jam, icing and sweet, sweet pride – at £1.20 each.Since the prodigy swept through golf like a wildfire just over a decade ago – and then flamed out at successive major tournaments – his career has become a psychodrama that tormented his fans and fascinated the sporting world.View image in fullscreenA message of congratulations in an estate agents’ window.Photograph: Paul McErlane/The GuardianFor Holywood, a picturesque County Down town outside Belfast, it was personal. If the town name was just shy of fairytale, so too was their sporting hero. McIlroy grew up and mastered the game here, a toddler with a club then a boy who flicked balls into a washing machine and set course records, before becoming arguably the greatest player of his generation.By 2014 McIlroy had won the Open, the US Open and the US PGA but the Masters eluded him – until Sunday, when a rollercoaster performance of sublime shots and terrible errors ended with a sudden death playoff and, eventually, a victory that made him the sixth man to complete the career grand slam.“Torture, my God, it was torture.

Another took a bath. Others compared the experience to having a stomach churn like McIlroy’s old washing machine.“Pleasure. Pain. Euphoria. Despair. The essential Rory,” said the Belfast Telegraph. “The great dichotomy of the man. It’s never straightforward.

Can I change my personality?I scored low for agreeableness in a personality test for the ‘big five’ traits – does this mean I’m doomed to be disagreeable? I looked into how I can change who I amElle HuntMon 14 Apr 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 12.33 EDTShareThe other day, a friend decided to playfully name our individual roles within the group: planner, emotional support, and so on. I was the fault-finder – or, as she put it, “the grumpy teenager” – who points out problems, but doesn’t suggest alternatives.She was only kidding around, but she struck at an insecurity I have: that I’m unacceptably, intolerably negative.My first instinct is to stress-test ideas for potential flaws. This critical tendency serves me well professionally, and feels true to who I am. If I don’t enjoy a film, for example, I don’t swallow my opinion. But I sometimes worry that it’s not much fun to be around, and may be working against me in my personal life. What I experience as an even, nuanced discussion about the new Bridget Jones film, or the works of Joan Didion, friends will sometimes remember as a heated debate.I wanted to know if I could objectively measure this “grumpiness”. Personality testing is a notoriously inexact science (and in the case of the Myers-Briggs,scarcely a science at all). But the so-called “big five” test isconsidered the most robust. It assesses agreeableness (including empathy, cooperativeness and social skills), openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion and neuroticism: together summarised as “Ocean”.When I took a free big five test online, the results were as I’d suspected. My highest ranking was 81 points for openness; by contrast, I scored just 33 for agreeableness.Does that mean I’m doomed to be disagreeable? Or can I change who I am?Journalist Olga Khazan has bad news for me. “Agreeableness is the toughest one to change,” she says.Khazan, a staff writer at the Atlantic magazine, should know. She spent an entire year trying to change her personality – documented in her new book Me, But Better.View image in fullscreenComposite: The Guardian/Olga KhazanHaving recently decided to start a family, Khazan recognised that her flinty, lonerish tendencies might not serve her well in motherhood. To increase herextraversion, she took improv comedy classes, forced herself to throw parties and attended MeetUp groups of like-minded strangers.In the process, she discovered that personality was not a consistent, immutable truth. “You have certain proclivities, but it is flexible – you do evolve over time, and if you want to change, you can change even faster,” she says.Even genetic factors aren’t impervious to the environment. Attending university, for example, can foster openness as it exposes you to new ideas, different people or opportunities to travel.Two factors seem particularly pertinent to tweaking your personality, Khazan goes on. “One is mindset: ‘I would like to be like this, and I believe I can change.’”The other is follow-through – “you have to actually do the behaviours associated with the new personality trait”.To some extent, personality change is about faking it ’til you make it, Khazan says: there’s no bigger secret than “go out and do it, for the rest of your life”.With time and repetition, improv, socialising with strangers and otherwise extending herself became easier. “It doesn’t necessarily feel like eating your spinach and running a marathon every day – it starts to feel more like just what you would like to do.”It’s not that there are bad personalities, or that you should aspire to a total overhaul, Khazan adds. But if we stick with easy, instinctual or habitual behaviours, we may sell ourselves short.“We tend to, over time, fall into patterns and habits that could use an update – to put it mildly,” she says.Now a parent, Khazan’s experiments in extraversion are paying off. “I’ve had a totally different approach to motherhood than I think I [otherwise] would have,” she says. “I’ve really made it a point to join new mom groups, reach out to other new moms and cultivate new-mom friends.”Before her personality-change project, she would probably “have tried to white-knuckle it”, Khazan says. “‘I’m not a joiner,’ ‘I don’t need these other people,’ ‘I’m not like other moms’ – I would have had more of that mentality.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I voice all the flaws I identified in a film, for example, it may come from a desire to express myself authentically or prove that I was engaged.Cultivating curiosity for what my friends thought could be a small step towards developing agreeableness, suggests Khazan. “You could still hang on to those thoughts, and that skill of analyzing things really closely, but you could also start to mention some things you did like, or get interested in why the other person liked it.”But every group dynamic is different, Khazan adds, kindly: some friends might be accepting of my critical tendencies, even appreciative. “That part of you might not need to be changed … Not everyone is for everyone.”Often people mistake agreeableness for being a chump or a pushover – “just doing whatever everyone else says”, says Khazan. But it’s more about social skills, including picking your moment and knowing your audience. It’s arduous work but worthwhile, Khazan suggests.People who rank high in agreeableness are happier, less likely to get divorced, have a high quality of life and are more resilient to adversity. People who rank lowest are generally psychopaths. I scored 33 points, not 0 – but I know what direction to be moving in.Many people seek to change their personality to make themselves more likable or gain others’ approval. But there’s also a selfish case, Khazan says. Addressing blindspots or imbalances can help us achieve our goals, and feel happier and more fulfilled. At the very least, the attempt can make us more comfortable with being uncomfortable.Khazan quotes the writer Gretchen Rubin: “‘Accept yourself, but also expect better of yourself’ – I think that’s a good philosophy.”More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?I like my own company. But do I spend too much time alone?People say you’ll know – but will I regret not having children?Trying to become just a bit more agreeable feels forced at first, just as Khazan warned. But with time and attention, I start to better attune to social interactions. In conversations I try to catch myself before launching into my opinion, to assess whether it was really solicited, and look for opportunities to ask questions instead of making yet another comment.After two weeks of gentle effort, I realise that when I start being negative for no real reason, I’m probably feeling over-tired, socially awkward or both. It’s strange to notice that I ramp up my views in hopes of generating energy or engaging my conversational partner.This feels productive: I might not have changed my personality, but I’ve gained more grasp on its expression. If “who we are” is fluid, perhaps I can think of cultivating self-awareness and positive change as growth. Call it 1% more agreeable – or at least less psychopathic.Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Changeby Olga Khazan is out nowExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?featuresShareReuse this content"

A painted version of his fist-pumping stance after being shot in July 2024 now greets visitors in the entrance hall of the White House. This “Fight, fight, fight!” canvas is true strongman art.It is just the latest in a series of artistic moves by Trump that look disturbingly tyrannical. When he complained that a portrait of himself in the Colorado State Capitol building was “purposefully distorted” it was taken down as quickly as if the US were Stalin’s Soviet Union. And he has ordered JD Vance to purge the Smithsonian museums of “improper ideology”. But how seriously should any of this be taken? Is it an urgent threat to democracy and culture or mere muscle-flexing?View image in fullscreenA poster for the Entartete Kunst exhibition in Munich, 1937.Photograph: © mahJ / Christophe FouinA show currently in Paris offers a troubling historical perspective on Trump’s art antics. “Degenerate” Art: The Trial of Modern Art Under Nazism, at theMusée Picasso, takes you back to the age of the dictators when totalitarian regimes sought to control art absolutely and use it to their own ends. I wasn’t keen to plunge into Nazi cultural history after the sunny pleasures ofDavid Hockney’s epic retrospective, but I was politely dragged along. The chill was instant.The show opens with fragments of sculpture displayed like archaeological relics – which is what they are. In 2010, archaeologists in Berlin excavating land cleared for a new underground line discovered not Roman coins or a medieval plague pit but remains of modernist artworks confiscated by the Nazis, branded “degenerate art” and dumped in a store that had been bombed in an air raid in 1944. The most compelling fragment, by the expressionist sculptor Emy Roeder, is the head of a primitive angelic being, severed at the shoulders. It’s a reminder of the fate of modernist art in German museums in the 1930s. Much of it was destroyed or lost, but not all.In 1937, more than 700 works of modern art went on display in Munich in the exhibition Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art) in order to be held up to ridicule and contempt. Afterwards, those with the most market appeal were sold abroad to benefit the Reich. At the Musée Picasso, some of these masterpieces have been reunited, borrowed from the collections where they ended up. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner’s 1913 paintingStreet, Berlinhas come from MoMA in New York.Its purple and black energy lifts you, as Kirchner depicts edgy, eroticised city life on the eve of the first world war, with two women parading past a crowd of sexually intimidated men. Kirchner’s painting was condemned for its attack on classical order and harmony, its jagged planes and purposeful distortions. Metropolis is another riotous vision, as the artist George Grosz equates artistic and political revolution.View image in fullscreenGeorge Grosz: Metropolis, 1916-1917.Photograph: Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza. Madrid/Estate of George Grosz, Princeton, NJ / Adagp, Paris, 2024These and other “degenerate” works were contrasted with the “healthy” Nazi art that was also unveiled in the same city in 1937 in a simultaneous exhibition called Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung (Great German Art). Hitler was in town to open it, and in the speech he gave, he defines degenerate art as the opposite of the Nazi athletic ideal that had been celebrated the previous summer by the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Rhetorically addressing the modernists, he tells them they just don’t get it with their primitivist art that looks like it comes from the stone age. They don’t see the beauty of Nazi man; degenerateArt, according to Hitler, portrayed “degenerate” people. It depicts, he claimed, “deformed cripples and cretins, women who can only have a repulsive effect, men who are closer to animals than humans, children who, if they had to live this way, would have to be seen as the veritable curse of God!”Is Hitler’s characterisation of modern art in any way recognisable? It took me a while to see why a Nazi may have been offended by Otto Dix’s unflattering, vivid portrait of the artistFranz Radziwill. He poses formally holding a T-square, yet looks around vacantly with his bulging upside down pear of a face. Is this an example of the imperfect detritus of humanity? If so, it’s just the tip the iceberg, for no artist so provocatively captured the freedom and experimentalism of the 1920s Weimar Republic. Dix’s paintings of sex workers and sailors, circuses and sado-masochist brothels, positively embrace degeneracy. As for “cripples”, Dix, Grosz and other German dadaists after the first world war insisted on showing Germany the maimed bodies of its wounded veterans, begging on street corners or playing cards with artificial hands.View image in fullscreenOtto Dix’s portrait of Franz Radziwill at the “Degenerate” Art exhibition.Photograph: Stéphane de Sakutin/AFP/copyright  Succession Picasso 2024/Getty ImagesIn other words, the Nazi attack on modern art was really an attack on the attitudes embodied in the Weimar years of liberal hope, and on radical Weimar art that burst with sexual freedom and social compassion. It was a culture war.Marc Chagall’sThe Pinch of Snuff (Rabbi)is one of the most haunting works in the Paris show. Inspired by a Yiddish tale of how a snuff addiction led to a rabbi’s demonic temptation, it was bought by Mannheim’s Kunsthalle in 1928. It came under attack as early as 1933, when local Nazis put it on a poster telling people this was what their taxes were paying for. I look into the rabbi’s eyes and see the lost world of Jewish eastern Europe that inspired Chagall, and which Nazi Germany would obliterate. In 1941, 16,000 Jews would be shot dead in Chagall’s home city Vitebsk, in just one episode among many.Such colossal violence and murder has to make us a bit careful with comparisons between today’s far right and nazism. Historians of the 20th century are still debating if today’s populism is a type of fascism, but it’s worth phrasing this another way: the Nazis were adept populists. Hitler was democratically elected in 1933 and the totalitarian regime he then built always claimed – and probably had – a populist mandate. Hitler boasted of a special connection with the “true” German people, his base, and for whom he spoke. As for the culture war on modern art, more than a million people saw Chagall’s rabbi and the other works in the Entartete Kunst show in just six weeks.L’art “dégénéré”,Musée Picasso, Paris, until 25 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designNazismDonald TrumpArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think he was lonely, thought this was a genuine friend, and we think he was given gifts on Roblox that made him feel special. It was really every parent’s worst nightmare.”David was among parents from around the world who shared with the Guardian that their children, often of primary school age, had been profoundly negatively affected by gaming on Roblox or had come to serious harm. Many alsoconfirmed the findings of a report last yearthat claimed Roblox was exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and abusive speech.Although some parents said Roblox had been a creative outlet for their children, brought them joy or even improved some of their skills, such as communication and spelling, the vast majority of parents who got in touch expressed severe concerns. These were mostly about staggering levels of addiction they had observed in their children, but also about instances of traumatising content in games their children could access despite parental controls, grooming, emotional blackmail, bullying, extreme political imagery such as avatars in Nazi uniforms, and strangers talking inappropriately to their children on the platform.“Deeply disturbing” researchby the digital behaviour experts Revealing Realityfound children as young as five were able to communicate with adults while playing games on the platform.Roblox acknowledged in response that children playing on the platform may be exposed to harmful content and “bad actors”, an issue the company claimed it was working hard to fix but that required industry-wide collaboration and government intervention. While the company said it “deeply sympathise[d]” with parents whose children have had negative experiences on Roblox, it did not engage with parental concerns about child users experiencing severe gaming addiction.Afreshly announced series of additional safety tools, aimed at giving greater flexibility to parents to manage their children’s activity on the site, failed to convince many of the parents the Guardian spoke to.“I don’t think the changes will address my concerns,” said Emily, a mother from Hemel Hempstead.There is no real way of policing the age of players“The new features are helpful but won’t stop the children being able to access inappropriate or scary content. People are allowed to choose the age ratings of a game they’ve created and they will not always be appropriate or accurate. I don’t think Roblox does enough to guarantee the safety of younger children on the platform.”Her seven-year-old daughter, she said, was having trouble sleeping as a Roblox game had taken her to a room with an avatar that was introduced as “your dad” and then shot dead.Despite Roblox claiming it had introduced “new easy-to-use ‘remote management’ parental controls”, parents said they had found it extremely difficult to navigate the parental control settings, and said it would take hours to regularly review their child’s activity. It was also impossible to tell, many stressed, who was really behind a user name.“Although Roblox do monitor the type of language being used, such as profanity, there is no real way of policing the age of players and some users talk in code,” said a mother from Rhondda Cynon Taff, Wales, whose autistic seven-year-old son plays on Roblox regularly.The company stressed that it had made it a default setting last year that under 13s can no longer directly message others on Roblox outside of games or experiences.Roblox admitted however that it was struggling to verify the age of users, saying that “age verification for users under the age of 13 remains a wider industry challenge”.I didn’t allow her to befriend strangers. I thought this was enough but it wasn’tNelly*, a mother from Dublin in her 40s, said her nine-year-old daughter had just finished a course of play therapy to process sexual content she saw on Roblox that triggered panic attacks.“I thought it was OK to play,” she said. “I also didn’t allow her to befriend strangers. I thought this was enough but it wasn’t.“There was an area that she went into and people wore underwear and someone came in and lay down on her.”It’s a fixation from morning to nightMany parents felt Roblox was exploiting children’s “underdeveloped impulse control”, as one father put it, giving them constant nudges to gamble and stay on the platform, and prompting many children to lose interest in other activities in the real world.Jenna, from Birmingham,said two months after her children had started playing Roblox, their “whole lives [had] been taken over” by the platform, echoing the remarks of scores of other parents.“I feel like I’m living with two addicts,” she said. “If they aren’t playing, they want to watch videos about it … When they get told to come off it’s like you’re cutting them off from their last fix – shouting, arguments, sometimes pure rage.”Peter, 51, an artist from London and father of three boys, said his 14-year-old son had become so addicted to Roblox and his devices generally that he had become violent, and had on one occasion broken a window with his fist when the game had been switched off.“The people who run Roblox don’t give a shit that parents can’t control the game. We’ve tried everything and nothing has worked. We’re now in therapy,” he said.Roblox’s chief executivehas advised parentsto keep their kids off the platform if they feel worried. Maria, a mother of three from Berkshire, was among many who highlighted, however, that it was difficult for parents to do so as children felt socially excluded when they were offline, and that the platform’s monetisation elements – unlocking higher game levels and personalisation features – had become status symbols among children.Roblox said in a statement: “We deeply sympathise with the parents who described theirs and their kids’ negative experiences on Roblox. This is not what we strive for, and not reflective of the civil online space we want to build for everyone.“Tens of millions of people have a positive, enriching and safe experience on Roblox every day, in a supportive environment that promotes connecting with friends, learning and developing vital STEM skills. While we recognise that no safety system operating at scale is perfect, we work tirelessly to enhance and improve our systems, processes and policies.”*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsInternet safetyChildrenGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

One of them throws a glass bottle, distracting their prey. Then she goes in for the kill with all the breezy confidence of a kid playing a video game on easy.It’s a rare moment of playfulness in the second-season opener ofThe Last of Us, a show that generally takes its storytelling deadly seriously. While the wildly lucrative Minecraft movie strip-mines its IP for laughs, this celebrated HBO series, adapted from the PlayStation titles of the same name, is as focused on taut character drama as the thrills and spills of the zombie genre.According to executive producer Carolyn Strauss, aHBOveteran who has commissioned everything from Sex and the City to The Sopranos, showrunner Craig Mazin pitched it to her as a story about love: “He said to me: ‘This is a show about the good and the bad of what love compels you to do.’”At the end of season one, we saw Pedro Pascal’s gruff smuggler Joel, who lost his own daughter in the opening episode, commit to a horrifying killing spree to save the life of teenager Ellie, played byBella Ramsey, and, in the process, doom the rest of humanity to a never-ending fungal apocalypse.View image in fullscreen‘It’s not about being a carbon copy of a game-rendered character’ … Bella Ramsey (left) and Gabriel Luna in The Last of Us season two.Photograph: HBO/Home Box OfficeMazin, an avid gamer, was transfixed by the relationship between the two characters in the video game, where they were brought to life by Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson.“Troy and Ashley made me connect in a way that I had never, ever felt playing a video game,” he tells me. “And I’ve been playing video games my entire life.”A non-gamer, Strauss was willing to take his word for it, but she wanted to understand what the game was about. “I made my son play it,” she laughs, “which he was very willing to do! And I just stood over his shoulder. I was drawn into the story very quickly.”For Mazin, the bold narrative choices of the original games were a large part of their appeal thanks largely to the instincts of creative director Neil Druckmann, with whom he shares a credit on the series.“Like all good artists, Neil was not content to simply play the song again,” he says of the sequel. “He wanted to challenge the audience.”These games are some of the smartest pieces of art on empathy ever madeKate Herron, directorWhen the rights to adapt the first game became available, Mazin leapt at the chance, describing it as “a moment of gorgeous clarity”. Coming off the back of the critically acclaimed Chernobyl, he was confident HBO would commission the show, as long as he could get Druckmann onboard.“We had lunch and I talked about how much I loved the game and what I thought it was really about, underneath the hood of zombies and fungus and fighting,” he says. “He’s very protective of it, as well he should be. And at that time, video game adaptations didn’t have a good track record.”That’s putting it mildly. In the past, efforts to drag game characters kicking and screaming into the real world have resulted in some serious stinkers. I grew up with 1994’s Street Fighter, which boasts an 11% Rotten Tomatoes score, and the notorious Super Mario Bros (1993), with its only slightly more respectable 29%.But it turns out even the ropiest adaptations have their defenders. “Don’t you besmirch Super Mario Bros!” laughs Gabriel Luna, who plays Joel’s brother Tommy in the series. “It’s a good movie!”Peter Howell, lecturer in computer games design at the University of Portsmouth, is in agreement – to an extent. “Don’t knock it!” he begs. “I admit it was terrible, but 10-year-old me watched it over and over again on VHS.”Either way, the wacky adventures of Bob Hoskins’ New York plumber are a world away from The Last of Us.Season onereceived near universal praise, scooping up dozens of awards.The source material certainly helps. Take, for example, The Last of Us Part II which the latest season of the HBO adaptation is based on. For me, one of the most powerful moments playing it came when I, as Ellie, was exploring Joel’s house and I found a photograph of his dead daughter, Sarah, on a chest of drawers. The level of “interaction” is limited to picking up the photo and taking a closer look, just as it might be in real life, and it has no real bearing on the action of the game. But a tiny moment like that can be unbearably powerful.View image in fullscreenYoung Mazino as Jesse in The Last of Us season two.Photograph: HBO/Home Box Office“You’re going through a series of sequences that the game designers have very carefully crafted to give you a particular experience,” says Howell. “Exactly as a director would do in a TV series.”In this respect, The Last of Us games are very different from the source material for another recent TV success story,Fallout, adapted from a series of open-world role-playing games.“They come from two different structures of games,” says Howell. “The Last of Us is very character-driven, and the story is pretty linear. It’s third-person, so you’re controlling a character on screen, rather than inhabiting the character. Whereas in the modern Fallout games, which are mostly first-person, the playable character is less narratively developed, so there’s more space for the player to insert themselves into that role, and it’s the player, as much as the character, who’s exploring the world.”It’s a difference that’s reflected in the two very different adaptations. “The approach they took with Fallout was the right one,” says Howell. “They didn’t try to replicate the narrative framework of the games. They used that setup to tell a new story that the series was better suited to tell, but including enough fan-service details to please existing players.”Mazin, too, is impressed with the approach taken by the Fallout series. “I know the people who made Fallout care deeply about it,” he says. “Neither of these shows were adapted cynically, just because the properties were popular. They’re written by people who grew up with video games, and who care about them as much as we do novels or plays.”Young Mazino, who plays Jesse, tells me that The Last of Us’s success is a testament to the creative partnership between Druckmann and Mazin.“There are auteurs behind games like these,” he says. “And you need another auteur to bring them into live-action. It’s the same thing you see with Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. The Last of Us is incredibly rich material, but it needs a master storyteller to elevate it.”“A lot of great storytellers are working in the gaming industry now,” Luna chimes in. “And that industry dwarfs our business 10 to one. That’s why you see us turning to games more, the way we used to turn to books and novels.”“Games have just gotten better,” adds Mazin. “I kind of used a cheat code saying I wanted to adapt this one! But on the other hand, there’s an enormous responsibility not to fuck it up.”That’s no trivial concern, since hardcore gamers have a reputation for being hard to please. “They like getting cross about things!” observes Howell.And not always for good reasons. While Ramsey’s Ellie has been widely praised, some gamers remain bitter that the part didn’t go to Alien: Romulus star Cailee Spaeny, who looks more like the video game character.“I find that stuff so ridiculous!” comments Mazino. “It’s not about being a carbon copy of a game-rendered character.”“I’ve experienced it before,” says Luna. “I was cast as the Ghostrider [in Marvel’s Agents of Shield], but it wasn’t the Johnny Blaze Ghostrider that they wanted. People are lacking in imagination these days, but that’s OK. We’re ready to prove it.”For Howell, though, the issue runs deeper. “There is a vocal minority of gamers who are very gate-keepery,” he says. “Particularly when it comes to female characters who are not traditionally ‘sexy’. There’s a deep-rooted issue around women’s representation in games.”Or as one online commenter put it: “I’m sorry the 14-year-old girl [in the series] wasn’t hot enough for you!”Mazin tells me he replays the games once per season. “Not because I need to refresh myself about the major plot points, but there are these little tiny moments that I’ll forget about. And then I see them and go: ‘Ooh! Ooh!That!’”That respect for the source material carries over to every level of production. “I have a rule that I won’t direct anything I’m not a fan of,” says director Kate Herron, whose previous work includes Loki and Dr Who. “These games are some of the smartest pieces of art on empathy ever made.”She’s not the only one on set with a reverence for the PlayStation titles. Luna played through the games meticulously after he was cast as Tommy – though it doesn’t sound like it was much of a chore.“I love my video games!” he reassures me, before reeling off a list of recent favourites: “Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Ghost of Tsushima …”But it’s when he mentions an older game, 1987’s scrolling shooter Contra, that his eyes really light up.“I used to play it with my brother,” he remembers. “Up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A-B-A-select-start. Then we’d have 30 lives and we’d beat the game!”If only surviving the horrors of The Last of Us were that simple.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe Last of UsPedro PascalDramaBella RamseyHBOfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Theatre’s epic endurance performers reveal how they keep the magic alive night after nightArifa AkbarMon 14 Apr 2025 11.40 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 12.32 EDTShare‘Ithought I’d do a year and leave,” says Sara Poyzer, who played mother Donna in the Abba musicalMamma Mia!“But the things I gained outweighed the things I lost.” She ended up staying in the part for an entire decade, even performing in front of two Abba members and at the show’s 20th anniversary, before leaving in January 2024.Among all the glitzy new openings in London’s West End, there are a sturdy cohort of shows that seem to have just always been there. Audiences still seem to be delighted byThe Lion King, now in its 26th year, and other long-running hits – but what’s it like for the actors like Poyzer, who play the same part seven or eight times a week, year after year? Does it become a groundhog day on the boards? And how do they keep their performances – and the shows – fresh?I have to train. I have to go to the gym. I have to eat right. You won’t last otherwiseStrangely, all the repetition and routine actually gave Poyzer a sense of creative freedom. “You say the lines in a certain order, stand in a certain spot, and all those things. But once they’re in place, I feel free.” She infused the role with aspects of her own character to keep Donna energised. “I have always taken my experience into my performance. So if I was feeling particularly emotional, a song might be a more emotional piece of storytelling that night. If I was pissed off, I’d be more fiery. I felt there was enough licence to be able to tell the story afresh.”It is important to understand that no two performances in a show’s run are ever the same, says Sean Jones, who has starred in Willy Russell’s musical Blood Brothers, in theWest Endand on tour since 1999. “There is always one new cast member and that’s the audience,” he says. “If you’re paying attention to them, you know you’ve got a different show on your hands every night. For example, we’ve just had a school audience in, which requires a different tack. If I start sobbing and snotting my way through the emotional scenes, it can make a teenager uncomfortable.”View image in fullscreen‘I find the energy because I love it’ … Sean Jones, left, with Joe Sleight in Blood Brothers.Photograph: Jack MerrimanAs you become more intimate with your character, they take on new depths, thinks Shaun Escoffery, who has played The Lion King’s benevolent king of the jungle for a whopping 17 years. “Mufasa is such a complex, multilayered character,” he says. “He’s a king, a warrior, a husband, a father, a brother to his arch-enemy. He’s deeply spiritual and open-hearted, but also a ferocious lion.”To have to encompass all of those qualities felt overwhelming at first, he says, but the part has evolved with him. “I’ve grown up playing the role. During that time, I got married, I had children, and that’s changed me as a man. So I’ve tried to implement being a father, being a husband and having a depth of spirituality into the character. It’s been a real epiphany for me.”Complacency is the enemy for Escoffery, not least because it risks letting down the audience and cast: “To become static or think, ‘I’ve got this’, is a very dangerous place to be.” He has an internal trigger to get himself ready for his role afresh. “I call it my on and off switch. It doesn’t matter how I’m feeling – I have to switch it on. That keeps me on my toes.”Jack Baldwin has been in the immersive show Faulty Towers: The Dining Experience for 13 years, playing beleaguered hotelier Basil. Baldwin never tries to replicate John Cleese’s performance in the original sitcom – nor his own from the night before: “That would be a museum piece.”The show requires lots of improvisation, which helps make each night different. “There’s a script, which is the spine of the show, but a lot of it is about turning to people and eliciting a response. You rehearse the fight choreography and the scripted bits but there are chunks where we are instructed to interact with the audience.”There is always an injection of fresh energy when a new cast member arrives. “I’ve had a lot of different co-stars,” says Jones, who in Blood Brothers plays Mickey, separated at birth from his twin, Eddie. “Every new Linda [Mickey’s friend] or Mrs Johnstone [his mother] is going to bring something different out in me. I feel like I am rediscovering the show again.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve grown up playing the role’ … Shaun Escoffery in costume as Mufasa, the Lion King, backstage at the Lyceum theatre.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPoyzer says she “can be slightly mischievous” on stage. “It’s amazing the amount of fire it can add.” She has just appeared in Come From Away and says: “Most of the cast were really playful. There was a moment when I’m meant to flirt with a character. I grabbed his lapels and pulled him towards me – which I’d never done before. I could sense him coming alive. I saw it in his eyes.”Striving for the best, most perfect version of her own performance is a constant challenge: “I have sometimes come off stage and thought, ‘That was brilliant. I want to do that tomorrow.’ I have chased that, thinking, ‘What did I do?’ and ‘How did I achieve that?’ Or, ‘Why did I not do it tonight?’ It’s almost mathematical.”Escoffery finds himself shifting his intentions, from performance to performance. “For example, I reflect on what Mufasa was thinking before his son Simba came, before he met the lioness Sarabi, before he became the king of the Pride Lands. What was his history?” George Asprey, who plays baddie Scar, joined The Lion King at the same time: “We know each other very deeply and keep each other accountable,” says Escoffery. “So if we feel a little bit of a lull, or there’s a lapse in our performance, we pull each other up.”View image in fullscreen‘I can’t do the goose-step for 13 more years’ … Jack Baldwin as Basil Fawlty.Photograph: Patch StudioLong-running shows can become family affairs. Jones met his (now former) wife, actor Tracy Spencer, on Blood Brothers and they toured as a family. His 15-year-old daughter, an aspiring actor, now wants a part. Poyzer was in Mamma Mia! with her actor-husband Richard Standing, who is still in the show. They have performed it around the world together.A long-running show, says Poyzer, can put enormous pressure on a voice. “You’re going to get fatigue, so you have to really take care of it, particularly when you’re singing repetitiously. It’s about readjusting your vocal cords and all the parts of your anatomy you use when you’re singing to constantly make sure it’s optimum.”Escoffery keeps to a highly disciplined exercise routine. “The show is very physical. I have to train, I have to go to the gym, I have to eat right. You won’t last otherwise.” In Blood Brothers, Jones plays Mickey as a child. Now that the actor is 52, he gets “more aches and bruises” but adds: “I find the energy because I love doing it. But there used to be a scene where Mickey would run on and leap over a sofa. About five years ago I was getting pain in my legs from that, so now I just run across the stage, which has the same kind of impact.”While the shows have largely stayed the same, the actors have noticed changes in their audiences. Faulty Towers was one of the first immersive shows and the form was little understood, even by Baldwin at first. People are more comfortable with the interaction now, he says. With Mamma Mia! there was a growing sense of ownership over the show following the success of the film, starring Meryl Streep as Donna. “A sense that this is ours, we know it, we’ve got the DVD.”Do they think they’ll all be in their roles for decades yet? Baldwin, for one, does not anticipate putting in another 13 years. “I don’t think I could do it physically,” he says. “I’d feel like I was cheating people if I couldn’t do certain movements that people want to see. The goose-step is the big one!”Jones left Blood Brothers twice but was pulled back. “I still loved it as much,” he says. “I still wanted to discover it as much – and I also like the touring lifestyle. Once upon a time, I would probably just have joined the circus.”Although Poyzer left Mamma Mia! to tour in Come From Away, she would love to return to Donna. “I’d like to play her again with all the experience, personal and professional, that I would bring to the role. I went to a restaurant last week in Italy. They were chatting about Mamma Mia! and made me sing The Winner Takes It All. I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve never sung it likethatbefore.’”Explore more on these topicsWest EndMusicalsTheatreMamma Mia!The Lion KingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take what we know about exercise. Just in the past few months, we’ve learned that moderate exercise mayalmost halvethe risk of postpartum depression for new mothers, and that even five minutes of exercise a day could helplower blood pressure.But what really caught my eye recently was a study from Latin America that included roughly 10,000 people who were assessed over two decades using the Mexico City prospective study. The research,published inthe British Journal of Sports Medicine, examined cognitive function with the aim of understanding the impact of exercise on mental ability, including mild dementia. The researchers took account of confounding variables such as age, diet, smoking and alcohol intake, nightly sleep and educational attainment, which have all been shown to affect overall health and wellbeing. By controlling for these factors, the contribution of physical activity towards mild cognitive impairment was estimated.The study found that “weekend warriors” – that is people who exercise only once or twice a week – were 25% less likely to develop mild dementia than those who didn’t exercise at all; while those who were regularly active (at least three times a week) were 11% less likely. The authors of the study didn’t address why weekend warriors actually fared better than regular exercisers, but focused on the big picture: they estimate that13% of mild dementia cases could be avoided if all middle-aged adults exercised at least once or twice a week.While we have known about the benefits of physical activity for physical health, such as preventing diabetes and hypertension, for a long time, newer research is pointing to the positive effects on our minds. As a personal trainer, I’m used to telling individual clients and classes how we can make certain muscles “stronger”. But people should also be encouraged to think more expansively about what’s going on – to visualise their muscles producing small proteins travelling up to their brain to protect neural matter. This is what makes us feel happy and helps delay mild dementia. Referred to as “muscle-brain cross-talk”, exercise has increasingly been prescribed as aneffective intervention for depression.Lowering bad cholesterol may cut risk of dementia by 26%, study suggestsRead moreThe latest analysis on mild dementia and exercise is exciting to read because it shows that you don’t have to do huge amounts of exercise – punishing daily regimes – to reap significant benefits to your health. So stop stressing if you can’t, or don’t want to, get up at 6am to exercise before work each day, or can’t make it to the gym in the evening because you prefer to see your friends or family. You can also look at your overall fitness plan, if you have one, in a weekly block, rather than being guilty if a few days go by when you’re not able to fit in movement. How active are you over seven days, and where can you add in enjoyable and easy ways to get moving – whether it’s a Sunday morning jog or a Saturday afternoon swim?Those of us in the physical activity community often think about optimising fitness – what is the best exercise, compound set of moves, or new hack to introduce? But this incremental fixation, which is really about the fit becoming fitter, and tinkering around the edges, misses the bigger picture: the wider public health challenge of getting those who are inactive, or feel like they’re not sporty, to get moving. So three cheers to the researchers in Mexico City if it’s the incentive you need – even just a little bit of exercise can go a long way.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsDementiaOpinionFitnessHealthHealth & wellbeingMedical researchcommentShareReuse this content"

So why am I so bothered by Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, which has just made a suborbital flight to the edge of space and back? OK, it’s partly the outfits (see Angels, Charlie’s, above), but it’s mainly the flight manifest: Perry joined Lauren Sánchez, Jeff Bezos’s fiancee;Amanda Nguyen, a civil rights activist; CBS Morningsco-host Gayle King; film producer Kerianne Flynn and former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe. I cannot help but notice that only two of these women had anything to do with astronauting (Nguyen studied astrophysics and interned at Nasa before becoming an activist).Obviously it’s very staid and 20th century to think that only experts should be allowed in space – yet their absence did suggest the primary purpose of the trip to be tourism rather than research. Which in turn suggests that this was a dumb waste of money. Which itself makes you wonder just how many of the world’s problems would have to have been solved before space tourism would look like a worthwhile enterprise – hard to put a number on it, but significantly more than have been solved today.Besides Bowe, the others were selected mainly for their contributions to culture – and again, yayKaty Perry– but also, presumably, because they’re all female. It’s framed as a feminist statement, and I guess we’re supposed to rejoice that space is no longer pale, male and stale. But something about the randomness of the guest list, coupled with the fact that they all have such nice hair, just … I don’t know … gives an impression of the gender that’s a bit incomplete. It may be one small step for some women; it does not feel like a giant leap for womankind.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKaty PerryOpinionBlue OriginSpacecommentShareReuse this content"

But unfunny and mean will always die a deathMon 14 Apr 2025 11.14 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 11.32 EDTShareIn these partisan times, when all is binary and everyone must pick a side, I have chosen mine. Aimee Lou Wood, she of The White Lotus and thus now instantly recognisable worldwide, is absolutely right to call out Saturday Night Live, the legendary US entertainment and satire show,for making jokes about her teeth. The special relationship is under enough strain without having to lean into old stereotypes about British gnashers. I am still reeling from theBig Book of British Smilesgag in The Simpsons and I continue to floss every day because of it.The SNL joke, if you are yet to see it, is part of a wider sketch making fun of the Trump administration. (Because if one thing has been proven to quell the march of the right, it’s parody.) A White Lotus character is mashed up with someone adjacent to Robert F Kennedy, he mentions fluoride, and a Wood-esque character says “What’s that?”It’s a funny joke, initially, because if one thing has transcendedThe White Lotus, it’s Wood’s smile. I haven’t seen The White Lotus myself. But I know three things about it. It’s set in Thailand, Arnie Schwarzenegger’s son is in it, and one of its main talking points has been the gaps between her teeth.However, it’s not a funny joke when you pull at its threads. Firstly, fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that is added to toothpaste and water because it helps keep teeth healthy. The premise of the joke, therefore, is that Wood’s teeth are unhealthy, which they absolutely are not. The joke is fundamentally dishonest and as a result, that initial laugh is followed by the shame of punching down at someone who is the star of a worldwide TV smash hit.Secondly, if British people do have “bad” teeth, it’s not because of a lack of fluoride, of which we are full to the brim. Heck, I think they even put it in our cider now. It’s because of a NHS that provides dentistry through contracts known asgeneral dental servicesthat are really complicated and thought of as not fit for purpose. It’s easier to find someone who will give you a free check-up of your gut health than it is to find someone to look into your mouth. But then it’s hard to tell a joke with that premise in three seconds.Wood saw the show, took to social media, and dubbed the skit “mean and unfunny”. There’s a lot there to unpack. Some jokes are funny, some are mean, some are funny and mean and, as Wood says, some are mean and unfunny. That’s the area best avoided.As someone who professionally mines funny, I think the lines in comedy aren’t that complicated. If you’re telling the truth, and your angle is clever enough, the joke is worth telling. If the joke only works if you turn a blind eye to the fact it is based on a fallacy, it is probably something that should remain on a Post-it note on a writers’ room wall. But, if these poor-taste gags sometimes escape, they serve to remind us that comedy writers aren’t perfect, cultural vacuums confuse actualities with bias, and the right to reply that famous people have means that this kind of transgression is not something you can get away with.At the end of the day, the skit told us more about the American obsession with having Tippex-white teeth as straight as Trump’s golf swing than it did Wood’s teeth. For that reason, she’s completely right to call them out. But here’s another thing for the SNL writers to consider: if we’re talking today about depictions of Wood’s teeth, and not the other points they were trying to make – about antivaxxers, illegal deportations, nonsensical tariffs and a collapsing economy – they appear to have missed the target. And in that case, the other victim is satire itself.Athena Kugblenu is a writer and comedianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And yet, in one of the wealthiest parts of the country, this is the daily reality for far too many families.Since being elected as MP for Kensington and Bayswater last year, I have been contacted more about housing than any other issue. More than half of the people who get in touch with my office want my help with housing problems: homes riddled with damp and mould; residents left waiting months – sometimes years – for basic repairs; people placed in temporary accommodation miles from their communities. The scale of the problem is enormous, and the damage is having a real impact on people’s lives.As we approach the eighth anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people in the community I now serve, we are still confronting the same culture that led to the tragedy: a system that ignores, belittles and disrespects the voices of social housing tenants. The Grenfell inquiry described how residents were treated by their housing provider as “a nuisance, or worse”. That culture is still alive in our housing system, and I see the consequences of it every day in the emails and letters I receive from residents.A recent housing survey I conducted of residents in Kensington and Bayswater reveals just how deep the crisis runs. Just over half (51%) of the 146 residents who responded said damp and mould were a major issue in their homes; 89% had reported a problem to their landlord in the past year, but 78% of those said it was not fixed at the first time of asking. And behind these statistics are stories of daily struggle.Take Sancha, who lives next to Grenfell with her five children. Her son uses a wheelchair and is waiting for open-heart surgery. They live on the top floor of a building where the lift constantly breaks. Their flat has no heating and no reliable hot water. She has been waiting more than three years to be moved to a suitable property in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea – and has heard nothing.Lacey, a mother of a six-year-old with autism, told me her daughter has tried to jump out of the window twice. Despite safeguarding warnings, the family remains in overcrowded, unsafe housing. “I’ve reached burnout,” she said.One parent told me their son is missing school due to chronic respiratory problems caused by damp and mould in their home – the very same hazard that led to the tragic death ofAwaab Ishakin Rochdale in 2020 after he was exposed to extensive mould in the one-bedroom flat he shared with his parents.Poor housing is one of the hidden drivers of inequality in the UK – limiting children’s opportunity, damaging people’s health and compounding the cost of living crisis. But here in Kensington and Bayswater, we sit at the sharpest edge of it. This is one of the most unaffordable places to live in the country, with some of the worst housing inequality anywhere in Britain – where, on average, just39 social or affordable homesare built each year. That’s the third-worst record in London, according to Trust for London. And it’s unacceptable.The positive news is that this government has committed to tackling our housing crisis from multiple angles. This includes the biggest increase in social and genuinely affordable housing in a generation as part of the 1.5m housebuilding target for England. To achieve that, the government recentlyannounced £2bnto deliver up to 18,000 new social and affordable homes, with significantly more expected in June’s spending review.Alongside new homes are new laws and regulations governing housing quality, withAwaab’s law coming into forcein October, thelong-overdue renters’ rights bill (which theTories are still trying to thwart), and requirements for more training and professional standards for housing officers.But from experience in my constituency, those policies will only deliver for residents if they are matched by a change in how social landlords operate. For example, I don’t believe any of our housing associations are currently capable of implementing Awaab’s law, including a 24-hour repair window for emergency levels of damp and mould. Too many are still failing to take basic responsibility, communicate clearly or treat health hazards with the urgency they demand.That’s why last week I launched asafe and healthy homescampaign, asking housing associations and local councils to sign up to three specific commitments: to deliver faster and higher-quality repairs services; to inspect and resolve damp and mould issues in line with Awaab’s law; and to improve communications, so residents receive accurate, timely and respectful updates about their homes. Some of the commitments will be legally enforceable by the autumn – and the key housing providers met residents at a public meeting on Thursday, where they agreed to the three commitments and added more of their own. They can be sure that I will hold them to account.Hundred-year wait for family-size social housing in parts of England, study findsRead moreMy hope is that this part of west London – with the legacy of Grenfell and its roots asthe birthplaceof many of the UK’s social housing landlords – can become a test bed for change. Because if we can get it right here, we can set the standard for the rest of the UK.But more than that, this is about restoring trust – not just in housing providers, but in the institutions meant to serve and protect us. When families feel unheard, ignored and forced to live in unsafe conditions, it erodes faith in the entire democratic system. If local and national governments can’t deliver something as basic as a safe home, people will lose faith in democracy itself. Fixing this crisis is central to this government’s mission: to restore trust and prove that public services can deliver – for everyone, no matter where they live.Joe Powell is theLabourMP for Kensington and BayswaterExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingLabourCommunitiesLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

That leaves two key questions for Ukraine’s European alliesDavid Shimer was the director for eastern Europe and Ukraine on Joe Biden’s National Security CouncilMon 14 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 13.31 EDTShareThe war between Russia andUkraineis approaching a historic turning point: unless the Trump administration adjusts course, US military aid for Ukraine is about to cease.In the months before leaving office, Joe Biden made a series of decisions to augment Ukraine’s stockpiles of vital munitions. Toward the end of 2024, the Department of Defense surged hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets and hundreds of armored vehicles to Ukraine, and that December, he approved an additional $1.25bn security assistance package for Ukraine, which has enabled the continued flow of US arms ever since (with the exception of thedamaging pauseordered by DonaldTrump in March).These decisions bought Ukraine time, but that time is running out. Ukraine is depleting its stockpiles of US munitions. The $1.25bn aid package will soon be exhausted. The United States still possesses several billion dollars in drawdown authority, which could be used to send Ukraine additional security assistance. But since taking office, Trump has not approved a single military aid package for Ukraine. Even if Trump were to reverse course and utilize this remaining drawdown authority, the amount available is insufficient to sustain US support for Ukraine over time. To do that, Congress would need to approve additional Ukraine funding, which will not happen while the Republican party controls both chambers and the White House. As a result, the era of US military aid to Ukraine is approaching its end.Trump was ‘the candidate of peace’. Now he’s fanning the flames of war | Mohamad BazziRead moreVladimir Putin is stalling the Trump administration’s ineffective pursuit of a ceasefire as he waits for Biden-era military aid deliveries to run dry. Over the weekend, shortly after the Russian presidentmet withthe US representative Steve Witkoff, the Russian militarylauncheda horrifying ballistic missile attack in Sumy that killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians. Putin is biding his time, eager to see whether the Ukrainian army will buckle in the absence of US military aid. As hesaid recently: “There are reasons to believe that we will finish them off.” Even if Russia is unable to capture much more territory, Putin will still wait for Ukraine’s position to become significantly more desperate before making any serious decisions about an end to this war. As US military aid for Ukraine winds down, North Korea, Iran and China are likely to continue, and could decide to increase, their support for Russia.Putin is planning for this war to continue for at least months longer. Russia faces its own challenges: Ukrainian forces continue to fight effectively and to imposeextraordinary costson the Russian military, and falling oil prices will place further strain on the Russian economy. Even so, Grigory Karasin, Russia’s representative in talks with the Trump administration, has indicated publicly that ceasefire negotiations will progress slowly over the course of this year. The US should be seeking to adjust Putin’s calculus – and to push him to engage in meaningful negotiations – by surging security assistance to Ukraine and intensifying sanctions against Russia. But regrettably, the Trump administration has done neither of those things, opting instead to pressure Volodomyr Zelenskyy and to make unilateral concessions to Russia.European leaders have stepped up in recent months to try to help Ukraine survive in the absence of US leadership. European discussions about a postwar reassurance force are important, but the actual war is still ongoing, and further planning is needed to deal with the impending loss of US material support.The key questions for Ukraine’s European backers are twofold: how can Ukraine persist with a combination of its own domestic production of weapons, European security assistance, and USintelligence sharing?; and what is the most viable pathway to finance this support?As a baseline, European countries should accept more risk tolerance in donating their own military equipment to Ukraine. Many European governments maintain significant stockpiles of artillery, rockets and air defense; given the stakes of this war, more of those capabilities should be provided to Ukraine. Meanwhile, these same European countries should increase defense spending to replenish their depleted weapons stockpiles over the longer term.Second, Europe should direct more resources into Ukraine’s innovative defense industrial base. Ukraine is producing cutting-edge drones, munitions and air defense capabilities that are reducing, though not eliminating, its reliance on external security assistance. Now is the time to finance Ukraine’s indigenous production of weapons, which are helping to blunt Russian assaults across the front.Third, the United Kingdom and France – as leaders in their support for Ukraine – should try to strike a deal with the Trump administration to secure additional air defense missiles for Ukraine. During the Biden administration, the United States diverted its air defense exports so that they would go to Ukraine first. A coalition of European governments led by France and the UK should attempt to negotiate an agreement with the White House to continue this policy – with the understanding that the Europeans will foot the bill. Under this arrangement, participating European countries would purchase AMRAAM and Patriot missiles for Ukraine off US production lines, and the Department of Defense would prioritize those purchases given Ukraine’s acute and ongoing air defense requirements. Trump may refuse this offer, but there is no downside to making the pitch, which, if successful, could be broadened to cover additional US defense exports that Ukraine needs.Fourth, the European countries supporting Ukraine will need to decide how to pay for all of this. One option is to dig into their own budgets. The other, more sustainable option is for Europe to seize the approximately $300bn in Russian sovereign assets currently immobilized in their jurisdictions. Those assets can be used to finance Ukraine’s defense industry, procure weapons from the US and around the world, and support the Ukrainian economy for years to come. Strategically, those assets would provide Zelenskyy with a durable source of non-US assistance, which would reduce Zelenskyy’s dependency on the US and increase his leverage in any negotiations to end the war. Many legal and policy experts have put forward strong arguments to justify seizure and to mitigate associated risks to the European economy. The costs of inaction today far outweigh the manageable risks of asset seizure.The realities of our current moment are both clear and regrettable: Putin has shown no indication that he will agree to a ceasefire, so this war will continue, and the end of US security assistance is approaching. Europe should move quickly to pursue the above steps and help save Ukraine from the coming storm.David Shimer served on the White House national security council from 2021-25, including as the director for eastern Europe and Ukraine and as director for Russian affairs.

The garden is electric with sex and postcoital doings: sparrows are shagging on the roof, nests are being frenetically constructed and grubs transported to nesting mamas. I spend my days voyeuristically peeping at tits (I got a nestcam for my birthday and I’m obsessed). Even educated fleas are doing it and I dread to imagine what filth the squirrels are up to.I tell you who isn’t doing it, though: Mao Sun and Xing Er, the Copenhagen zoo pandas. Since their arrival in 2019, the pair haven’t managed to mate. This is my third year tuning in to the intense will-they-won’t-they soap opera, shared by keeper Nadja Søndergaard on her extremely entertaining Instagram account@thegoodbearsandme. The pandas are solitary creatures, only coming together for Mao Sun’s 36-hour oestrus window. But to maximise their chances of actually having sex, there’s a whole elaborate lead-up of letting them see each other, swapping enclosures, spreading urine and “secretions”, and checking for the telltale tail raise that shows Mao Sun’s hormones are peaking.View image in fullscreen‘We’re just good friends!’ Xing Er and Mao Sun in 2022.Photograph: Imago/Alamy“Date 2025” started promisingly, with the bears following each other around, sniffing and engaging in some light erotic wrestling. However, rather than getting it on, they proceeded to spend most of the ensuing period playing chase, somersaulting away from each other while squeaking like Teletubbies, eating bamboo at opposite ends of the enclosure and napping. It was, frankly, farcical – but we’ve all had dates like that, I suppose.Everyone has a theory about panda libido, but surely we can all agree humans are most of the problem. If we’d left their habitat alone, their sex lives would be private panda business, as they should be. As for these two Scandinavian specimens, my best friend wonders whether they’ve joined the South Korean “no sex, no kids”4B movement: “Perhaps some of their ancestors strayed on to the Korean peninsula and developed a taste for celibacy?” I assumed they just didn’t fancy each other, but watching, it felt more like they don’t know what to do.

A letter from Prime Minister Jim Callaghan awaited them, hailing the shift a triumph for the state-owned plant and for Britain. It might be back to the future after Sir Keir Starmer greeted Scunthorpe workers this weekend, to mark his governmenttaking controlof British Steel from its Chinese owners.The UK has stumbled – or rather been dragged – back into industrial policy. After decades of laissez‑faire hand-wringing, the looming closure of Britain’s last blast furnaces forced the business secretary’s hand.Nationalisation, a word redolent of postwar statecraft, is back on the table. And rightly so.Britain’s policymakers are waking up to the fact that strategic sovereignty isn’t a quaint 1945 idea – it’s the key to energy transition, secure supply chains and a functioning economy. Steel is also about political memory, local identity and who gets a future. That question has long been answered unevenly – and steel regions are where the consequences land hardest. Chris McDonald, Labour MP for Stockton North and former chief executive of the UK’s steel innovation centre,toldMPs global steel isn’t a free market – it’s shaped by state power. France backs its industry with procurement. Germany subsidises energy. China hands out cash. The US blocks foreign rivals. The UK’s mistake has been to outsource industrial policy to the market.The steel industry accounts foraround 8%of global greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce that requires moving to electric steel mills that produce about 80% less carbon compared to a blast furnace. But this greener form of steel production relies on two key inputs: recycled scrap for most applications and DRI (direct reduced iron) – iron with minimal impurities – for aerospace or medical uses. Pharmaceutically pure steel may sound niche – until you’re replacing a knee.Surgical implantsdemand extreme purity, zero toxicity and total corrosion resistance.If the UK wants low-carbon steel, it needs a plan for virgin iron. But that means building DRI plants, greener supply chains and long-term access to high‑purity iron ore – none of which Britain currently produces. It’s a rude awakening for a country that bet on the market to deliver. TheSwedes, as it happens, did not make that bet. They built a ecosystem of state-owned mining, steel and green energy firms, and delivered fossil-free steel to Volvo in 2021 – with subsidies, strategy and shared purpose.GermanyandAustriaare following suit. Meanwhile, the UK parliament has only just decided it’s OK to intervene.The Scunthorpe takeover concedes what should have been obvious: steel is a national asset, not just another market failure. But the roadmap is missing. Green-powered DRI plants are the likely next step, feeding electric arc furnaces. But these slash steelemploymentby 80%. The real challenge? Shifting workers fast enough to green jobs before the old ones vanish. The government’s forthcomingsteel strategymust do more than tinker. It must forge the future. Less than 10% ofglobal iron ore reservesare currently suitable for DRI. Analysts suggest there needs to be atenfoldrise in DR-grade supply to meet a 2050 net zero target. Better to get ahead now than play catch-up later. Britain must resist the allure of short-term fixes and think like a country that still makes things – and wants to keep doing so.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was a tribute to Mr Schäuble’s extreme fiscal conservatism, which had delivered Germany’s first balanced budget in the postwar period. Amid resurgentprosperityin the Angela Merkel years, the so-called black zero – symbolising a constitutional prohibition on public debt – had gradually acquired cult status.As a new administration prepares to take power in Berlin, it seems unlikely that human euro signs will welcome the latest politician to take on Mr Schäuble’s former role. But in dramatic fashion, the spending taps are set to be turned on. Via a swiftly stagedMarch votein the outgoing Bundestag, “debt brake” dogma was consigned to history by the chancellor‑elect, Friedrich Merz. The way was thus paved for groundbreaking expenditure on defence, and the overhaul of an economy being left behind in a changed, suddenly menacing world.So much for the theory – now for the practice. Mr Merz, the centre-right leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), last weekconcludedthe fastest set of coalition talks since 2009. Pending approval of the deal by Social Democratic party (SPD) members, he is expected to be sworn in as chancellor in by early May. In office, the “grand coalition” agreed between the CDU and the SPD – handed seven ministries including finance and defence – will immediately be confronted by challenges that dwarf those faced by almost all its predecessors.The US under Donald Trump, whether as economic partner or military ally, can no longer berelied upon– an era-defining shift whatever the outcome of the current tariff wars and Mr Trump’s negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine. China, once a vast outlet for the exports which fuelled growth, has morphed into a fearsome competitor, including on German soil. A stagnant economy, combined with a post-Merkelbacklash against migration, has accelerated the rise of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), one of the most extreme far‑right parties in Europe. Last week, a poll fatefully placed the AfD in the leadfor the first time.The pressure from the right – both from within his own party and from the AfD – is having an impact. Mr Merz’s Trumpianpromiseto turn asylum seekers away at German borders from his “first day”, along with other draconian measures, will only allow the far right to up the ante still further. Meanwhile, he also appears to be looking for wriggle room on agreed coalitioncommitmentsto the less well off and toclimate targets.Nevertheless, the broad economic thrust of the deal remains right for troubling times. The European Central Bank must play its part – by keepingyieldson a leash. As Germany’s neighbours deal with similar geopolitical threats and uncertainties, the ability of the EU’s most powerful member state to show leadership and forge a path through the crisis will be crucial. With short-term growth acutely vulnerable to mood swings in the White House, the effects of spending will take time to be felt in people’s everyday lives. But the prospect of a transformative increase in public investment offers the hope of industrial renaissance and a restoration of voters’ trust in thepolitical centre.Alongside his SPD counterparts last week, Mr Merz confidentlyannouncedthat Germany was “back on track”. Europe badly needs him to be right.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But nobody should be under any illusion that this is going to happen overnight. Despite the recent budget boost for the NHS, finances for hospitals, mental health, community and ambulance services are stretched to the limit.People are the backbone of theNHS, but growing demand and workloads, vacancies and financial pressures have left far too many staff feeling worn out and suffering low morale. This has driven up the rate of people leaving the health service. Worries about staffing cuts as trusts try to balance their books are going to make an already tough situation even harder for overstretched frontline teams.A healthy nation needs a healthy NHS workforce. To achieve this, the NHS needs to recruit, train and keep the right amount of staff with the right mix of skills in the right places. That – and sustainable social care staffing – is what a plan for the next 10 years and a refreshed long-term strategy for the workforce must address, as trusts continue to work flat out to do all they can to make the most of every pound that goes into the NHS.Saffron CorderyInterim chief executive, NHS ProvidersI recently retired from psychiatry practice after 42 years in the NHS. I have seen many reorganisations and cuts reframed as “efficiency savings”. In the 1990s, there was a move to reset community psychiatric care to be largely provided by non‑professional staff at lower cost than the elusive and expensive community psychiatric nurses, occupational therapists and social workers. The results of awell‑conducted trialof the new system against the old showed it to be less effective and more expensive, with marginally worse outcomes.At the time, the enthusiasts were keen to press on but, happily, large amounts of money were not wasted in this way – perhaps because the next round of “efficiency saving” came rolling through.Dr Geoffrey SearleSalisburyAs the parent of a newly qualified doctor about to begin foundation year 1 training, I am witnessing first-hand the alarming crisis in medical career progression that threatens the future of our NHS.Instead of celebrating her medical qualification, my daughter is caught in an anxiety-inducing scramble to build a competitive portfolio for specialty training. The British Medical Associationrecently highlighteda “significant year-on-year increase in applicants for specialty training places … without a commensurate increase in available positions”. The bottleneck is so severe that many UK-trained doctors face the prospect of unemployment or insecure fixed-term contracts.The UK has “far fewer doctors than equivalently wealthy countries”, according to the BMA, yet successive governments have failed to plan adequately for workforce needs. Our brightest medical graduates are being forced to compete against increasing numbers of international applicants for too few training positions.We need immediate expansion of specialty training positions and a comprehensive workforce strategy that values and retains the doctors we’ve already trained. Without urgent action, we risk losing a generation of medical talent at precisely the moment the NHS needs them most.Name and address suppliedHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

While student engagement and the addiction to phones and social media certainly need to be addressed, schools are more likely to support students’ development if they teach them how to use technology in ways that are healthy, purposeful and life-enhancing. A balanced, nuanced approach to phone use can still promote social interaction for children of all ages and encourage learning beyond the classroom.All students should be equipped to access quality information and transfer knowledge quicker in their pursuit of independent learning. If phones or tablets can help achieve that goal, maybe we should not be so quick to dismiss them in schools.Shouldn’t we instead aim to help students become confident in using digital devices in and out of school? How else will young people learn how to think critically and navigate online spaces filled with disinformation that is supercharged by artificial intelligence?Dr Robert HarrisonDirector of education and integrated technology,ACS International SchoolsDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Justin Rose will feel it most. Rose, the antagonist in Rory’s story, scored 65, 71, 75, 66 – the last of them, he said, “a bogey away from being the greatest round I’ve ever played”.The second shots in the playoff summed it up. Rose’s was pretty near perfect in the circumstances and landed 15 feet from the pin. McIlroy’s landed just beyond it, caught the slope, rolled back down and around, past Rose’s ball and finished up 5ft from the cup. Sometimes good just isn’t good enough. “Yeah, it hurts,” Rose said. “What are you going to do about it, though?”‘Welcome to the club’: Woods leads salutes to McIlroy’s Masters win and grand slamRead moreHe was the first to hug McIlroy close in the moments after he had made the winning putt. “Listen,” he told him, “I was glad I was here on this green to witness you win the career grand slam.”Rose has now written himself into the story of the tournament, it will be impossible to tell the history of the Masters without mentioning him. He has finished runner-up three times,losing two playoffs. Both times, he was second-best to two of the most popular Masters champions,Sergio García, who won his first majorafter 21 years of trying here, in 2017, and now McIlroy, who completed the career grand slam.Any other year, the European fans would have been thrilled when Rose holed that 20ft putt on 18 to tie the lead, but not this one. Rose understood. “We saw part of history today,” he said. “It’s a momentous day in golf.”Rose made a little of it. He is the first to have led the field through the first two days of competition on three occasions and is in the extraordinary position of having been top of the Masters leaderboard after 18, 36, 54, and 72 holes, twice, without winning it.View image in fullscreenJustin Rose has twice lost in a playoff at the Masters.Photograph: David J Phillip/APHe is 44 now, and playing as well as ever, but at that age things change quickly.

I took a moment just soaking that in. That was a nice moment because it was still what might be, what could be. One day, I won’t be competing this way at this tournament. So for now, the hard work is worth it.”McIlroy said: “He’s a great champion. He has displayed so much grace throughout his career. I remember watching the playoff in ’17 when he went up against Sergio and that didn’t quite go his way, either. But he’s had a phenomenal record around here and I feel for him because he’s been so close, and he’s a good friend, and …”McIlroy knowsthe disappointment better than mostand stopped to swallow a lump in his throat. “Yeah, hopefully he has a few more opportunities.”Their friendship was forged through all the years of playing together in theRyder Cup. It was conspicuous that as well as Rose, a couple of other Europeans, Tommy Fleetwood and Shane Lowry, were among the first to congratulate McIlroy. Even in the thick of all this, the tournament at Bethpage in September was in the back of McIlroy’s mind.“Selfishly, I was happy it was another European in the playoff,” he said. “We’re on a good run at the minute, Ryder Cup year and all that.”It had not been quite clear whether Rose was going to make the team this year, but there is no doubt about it now.He will be ready.“What do you choose to dwell on? There’s no point in being too despondent about it. You have to look at all the good stuff that got me into this situation. You can’t skip through a career without a little bit of heartache. It’s not going to happen.“If you’re willing to lift the big championships, you’ve to put yourself on the line. You have to risk feeling this way to get the reverse.”If you can’t be a great winner, you can still be a good loser.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersJustin RoseRory McIlroyRyder CupGolfPGA TourEuropean TourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Villa must overturn a two-goal deficit after a first-leg defeat in France and the Villa manager doubled down on his belief that his side can cause a shock, with Emery adamant the “fortress” atmosphere at Villa Park on Tuesday can help his players find a winning formula.Emery said PSG’s 3-1 lead does not alter the task at hand. “I have experiences coming back from results, positively and negatively,” he said. “Now it is something different, we want to write here the history with Aston Villa. Last year [we played] in the Conference League and this year in theChampions Leagueand [now] hopefully for a long time in Europe. My experiences before were different … sometimes losing away and winning at home, sometimes losing at home and winning away. More winning than losing … but I had some negative experiences as well.”Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreEmery was on the wrong end of an infamous fightback when Luis Enrique’sBarcelona triumphed 6-1 at the Camp Nou against his PSG teamin the Champions League in 2017, a humiliating last-16 exit, known asLa Remontada(“The Comeback”), given PSG won the first leg 4-0. Emery won the Europa League with Sevilla in 2014, his first major European trophy, after recovering from a 2-0 first-leg reverse against Real Betis earlier in the competition.Emery added: “I’m not going to remind the players of those experiences because my idea and my every word with the players inside is sending the message of how we are getting experiences together here withAston Villa. With the players we are, with the experiences we are adding in our bag last year and this year. As well with the combination we have with our players mentally and as well tactically to play, being so, so demanding in our process to get opportunities and believing to beat PSG. We need to use Villa Park like a fortress. We have felt it a lot of times. We have to believe.”Emery dismissed suggestions PSG could be fresher given they have had a clear run of six days before the second leg, while Villa travelled to Southampton andwon 3-0 on Saturday. The Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), French football’s governing body, agreed to reschedule PSG’s Ligue 1 match with Nantes, which was originally scheduled for last ­weekend. “We have the habit of playing a lot of matches in a row, three matches in a week, and as well they also have this habit,” the Villa manager said. “They are ready to play. They are rested but for me it’s not very relevant.”The England forward Morgan Rogers, a key Villa player this season, echoed Emery’s sentiments that the atmosphere could be a secret ingredient in any comeback. “There’s massive belief. Most people wrote us off before the tie. We’re excited, under the lights at home, playing in the quarter-finals of this competition … there are not many places better to be. If anyone’s going to turn it around, it’s going to be us.”Asked about the role of the supporters, Rogers added: “In the position we’re in, the second leg being at home is massive for us. We can create our own atmosphere. We have done it this season in the big games, not just in the Champions League but in our big league games as well. They’re a massive boost for us. That energy, that feeling, that vibe is sometimes bigger than the actual game.“That’s what drives you on … you can forget about all the tactics or the intricate stuff we’re going to work on, sometimes it’s just about that sheer energy and heart and determination within the stadium. Sometimes that can be just enough to pull you through tough moments and get you to where you need to go. We need every bit of support and we’ll feed off that 100%. We’re excited for the challenge.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

PSG have conceded seven Ligue 1 goals from set pieces but just two in the Champions League. “If I speak about them, maybe tomorrow they will perform fantastically,” he said, smiling. “They have been successful defensively at set pieces. How? Because they are not conceding a lot of corners, a lot of fouls. They are avoiding the opponent’s capacity to threaten them through set pieces because they are not conceding a lot.”Explore more on these topicsAston VillaChampions LeagueUnai EmeryParis Saint-GermainnewsShareReuse this content"

That changed on Monday afternoon when they released a statement announcing his diagnosis and including a message from Howe thanking medical staff for their care and the wider football community for their good wishes.Howe remains in hospital but Tindall sure Newcastle win has ‘lifted his spirits’Read moreHis assistant, Jason Tindall, aided by Graeme Jones, will once again lead the team at home against Crystal ­Palace on Wednesday night and at Aston Villa on Saturday evening. It is still unclear when Howe will be well enough to return to work but Newcastle are expected to issue further updates after the Villa game.Howe watchedNewcastle defeat Manchester United 4-1 on Sundayon television from his hospital bed a long goal kick away from St James’ Park, but was too unwell to have any remote input on proceedings. After beating Ruben Amorim’s side, Tindall saidhe had received a text message from the managerbut had not spoken to Howe for a number of days.After his illness was revealed on Monday, Howe issued a message via the Newcastle website. “A huge thank you to everyone connected withNewcastle Unitedand the wider football community for your messages and warm wishes,” he said. “They have meant a lot to me and my family.“I also want to pay tribute to our incredible NHS and the hospital staff who have treated me. I’m immensely grateful for the specialist care I’m receiving and, after a period of ­recovery, I look forward to being back as soon as possible.”Howe’s team ended a 70-year domestic trophy drought bybeating Liverpool in the Carabao Cup finalat Wembley last month. He hopes that a memorable season, which only a fortnight ago involved him and his players being serenaded by 300,000 fans in central Newcastle, will end with Champions League qualification.Given that Newcastle are fourth and would leapfrog Nottingham Forest into third with a draw against ­Palace, a place in Europe’s showpiece competition is within their grasp. Howe will hope to be back alongside Tindall in the technical area for the campaign’s closing stages.Explore more on these topicsEddie HoweNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

But the team principal, ­Christian Horner, admitted there will be no quick fix.Horner conceded the team have problems that need to be addressed as soon as possible, but he said: “This race has exposed some pitfalls that are obviously very clear that we need to get on top of very quickly. Ultimately you can mask it a little through setup and we were able to achieve that last weekend in Suzuka. We understand where the issues are, it’s introducing the solutions that obviously take a little more time.”Lando Norris left searching for answers after disappointing Bahrain GPRead moreThe technical director, Pierre Waché, the motorsport adviser, ­Helmut Marko, and the chief engineer, Paul Monaghan, convened along with Horner to address the problems that have beset them and given Verstappen a mountain to climb in his title defence.Marko described the performance as “very alarming” and told German TV “the concern is great”. Verstappen, who said “everything went wrong that could go wrong”, could even consider his future at another team. Marko had previously made a point of emphasising that the Dutchman has a ­performance-related escape clause in his contract. Sky’s Ted Kravitz reported witnessing Verstappen’s manager, Raymond Vermeulen, angrily confronting Marko in the team’s garage after the race on Sunday.Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton and the Ferrari team principal, Fred ­Vasseur, believe they are making positive steps to improve this season. They both viewed Hamilton’s effort as a better performance, with both parties becoming better attuned to one another. Hamilton finished fifth at the Sakhir circuit in a racewon in dominant style by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri. It was the British driver’s best grand prix result with theScuderiasince joining this year.Charles Leclerc, Hamilton’s teammate, was fourth but, while theFerrariremained off the pace of McLaren and Mercedes, it was an improvement after a slow start to the season. ­Hamilton suggested he was ­becoming accustomed to the new team and car after 12 years with Mercedes.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton (centre) said he ‘learned a lot’ from his performance in Bahrain.Photograph: Eric Alonso/DPPI/Shutterstock“I think I’ve figured out how the car likes to drive so, if I apply that next week, if I can qualify better, I’ll have a much better ­weekend,” he said. “Finally we were in a spot and my driving style seemed to be working in that moment and so I learned a lot this weekend, probably more than all the other weekends.”Similarly, Vasseur said that their working partnership was progressing positively and he expected both team and driver to improve further. “You won’t replace 12 years of collaboration in two weeks or two races,” he said. “We need to improve but this is true for everybody in the paddock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After Bahrain he remained convinced the team and Hamilton would do the same again.“In terms of management we have to take it a bit easy, to calm down, we have ups and downs as everybody. The issue is probably that the ups for us are a bit higher and the downs are a bit lower,” he said. “It means if we want to keep a consistent approach, and we did it very well the last two years, we have to stay calm, try to improve by hundredths of a second.

The battle for European places is some way off being decided. Thanks to an early goal and a dogged defensive display that went against type, Bournemouth have relaunched their candidacy.Afterransacking champions-elect Liverpool, inconsistencies have stopped Marco Silva’s Fulham being a true contender for the top five. Victory in Dorset could have placed them in the Justin Rose, striking-distance position. Instead,Bournemouth leapfroggedthe Londoners into eighth.Bournemouth v Fulham: Premier League – liveRead moreFollowing a first league win in seven, Andoni Iraola’s team have six games remaining to rescue previously fading dreams of continental football for the first time in club history. “I think we needed this performance, defending our own box well, the clearances, the blocks, the basics, the set plays,” said Iraola. “This win comes in the perfect moment for us.”During recent disappointments,Bournemouthfans have had to cope with talk of their heroes being sold on elsewhere. Those getting their kicks from transfer tattle will know Dean Huijsen is linked to just about everyone, Real Madrid included. On his 20th birthday, the lofty, assured central defender and keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga led a rearguard effort that followed Antoine Semenyo’s eventually decisive, opening-seconds goal.If excitable Liverpool fans have already pencilled Milos Kerkez into Andy Robertson’s left-back position they will be enthused by the Hungarian’s solidity in defence and frequent launching of attacks. Another mooted contender for the Liverpool No 3 shirt in Fulham’s Antonee Robinson meanwhile blotted his scouting file with the mistake that set up Alex Scott’s run and Semenyo’s finish after 52 seconds.Such incision reminded what made Iraola’s team such appointment viewing during their winter purple patch, and also why the football economy can be so cruel in so quickly separating talented teammates. “We had to defend as a unit and stick together,” said Semenyo.“We made it difficult for ourselves at the start of the game,” said a grumpy Silva. “We started really badly, we have to take the responsibility for that as we need to start the game with the right intensity, quality and decision-making necessary at this level.”Bournemouth might have been three clear by half-time, Evanilson missing two good chances, including cracking the crossbar. Chance creation is rarely problematic for Bournemouth, execution has been a serious issue during a winless run stretching back to 15 February. Another early second-half chance flew by when Tyler Adams poked a shot that Bernd Leno saved instinctively with his trailing leg.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo drills home the winning goal for Bournemouth.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersSilva had seen enough, making three quick changes, sending on Tom Cairney, Raúl Jiménez and Adama Traoré. Here, confusion reigned. Ryan Sessegnon left the field, only to be ordered by Silva to return. Instead, the fourth official, Tim Robinson, ruled that with number called and Sessegnon having stepped off, he could not return. Sasa Lukic had been the intended departure, it became clear afterwards. The source of farce, it was also revealed, had been communication breakdowns between manager and assistants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fourth official was confused throughout the game, in all circumstances.”Alex Iwobi, match-winner against Liverpool but quiet here, belatedly arrived in the contest when testing Arrizabalaga from 25 yards. The Chelsea loanee was proving equal to the challenge. On came Emile Smith Rowe, a discarded jewel Silva is yet to polish, to play off Jiménez but Huijsen used all his height and guile to marshal the resistance.“I believe in my abilities and try my best for the team,” said the birthday boy. “We play high-press football, we are fearless in that sense, I am so happy we could win.”During brief Bournemouth respite, Evanilson claimed a penalty but Leno had won the ball before contact was made. Soon enough, Shaun Cooper, Iraola’s set-piece specialist, was heard calling plays when Fulham won a series of late corners. Time added on was lengthy after that substitution confusion but, with Arrizabalaga and Huijsen climbing highest and bravest, a successful rearguard effort confirmed that Bournemouth can do things the hard way.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Lampard served a one-match touchline ban at the MKM Stadium and was fined £2,000 after his sending off at the end ofthe defeat by Burnleyearlier this month for an outburst at referee James Bell.While Coventry largely dominated Hull and went ahead through a deflected strike from Matt Grimes, who earlier produced two goalline blocks to deny Kasey Palmer, substitute Abu Kamara equalised. Lampard’s side therefore stay sixth, moving three points clear of seventh-placed West Brom, and the manager may rue his team’s lack of a clinical edge as Hull goalkeeper Ivor Pandur made several important saves.Semenyo’s swift strike stuns Fulham to end Bournemouth’s winless runRead moreHull remain in 20th but are now three points clear of the relegation zone with just four matches left, largely thanks to the heroics of Pandur. The Croatian was out of position early on when Ellis Simms got in behind the defence but a poorly executed lob went wide, although the Hull shot-stopper then did well to push away Haji Wright’s header.Pandur denied Wright twice more as Coventry continued to dominate but Hull had the best chance of the half after 38 minutes as Palmer’s two shots from Regan Slater’s cutback were blocked on the line. With the goal gaping, the former Coventry midfielder saw his low efforts kept out by a perfectly positioned Grimes, whose clearance thumped into teammate Milan van Ewijk but somehow stayed out of the net.View image in fullscreenCoventry City head coach Frank Lampard walks through the stand as he served a one-match touchline ban.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAGrimes’ interventions gained added significance when Coventry went ahead a minute after the break to get the goal their first-half display deserved – even if Hull could count themselves unfortunate. Grimes was involved again as Hull half-cleared to the edge of the box and his scuffed left-footed volley took a cruel deflection off Charlie Hughes, with Pandur having committed to diving the other way.Grimes’ opener soon should have been added to as a quick burst from Simms left the Hull defence in his wake but despite no lack of power on his shot, Pandur was able to excellently tip away for a corner. Even then, Hull were not out of the woods as Wright’s close-range header came back off a post, while Jack Rudoni’s teasing cross after skipping past a couple of Hull challenges just evaded Simms.With Hull getting thoroughly outclassed, Rubén Sellés introduced Nordin Amrabat and Kamara just before the hour and it had the desired effect as the latter struck with just eight minutes remaining. This time, Coventry were left cursing their luck as Kamara’s strike from a narrow angle ricocheted off Jay Dasilva and wrongfooted goalkeeper Bradley Collins before trickling in at the near post.Coventry still might have nicked all three points at the death but Pandur produced one final vital stop by parrying away Van Ewijk’s sharp shot from the edge of the area as it finished all-square on a frustrating night for the visiting manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We do our prep through the week, this one I’ll just take on the chin for what it was.”“That feels like a huge point,” the Hull head coach, Rubén Sellés, said. “To be able to come back and get the point, I think the game was going in that direction – they had some chances, so did we.

The region has been forecast to receive 140-160mm of rainfall between Sunday and Friday this week.Turin could face 50-60mm of rain on Wednesday alone – equivalent to north-west Italy’s average rainfall for the entire month of April – with a chance of flooding and landslides.Corsica is expected to be hit by significant rainfall totals of more than 120mm in places. Tuscany is under alert for rainfall totals exceeding 55mm from Monday.The stormy weather is driven by a developing low-pressure system over the region, which is drawing in warm, moist air from the Tyrrhenian Sea. As this air mass meets the Alps, it is being forced upwards, triggering rapid condensation and heavy precipitation as a result of orographic lift.Meanwhile, central and easternEuropecould get an early taste of summer this week, with unusually high temperatures forecast across several countries.Daytime highs of up to 24C (75F) are likely in Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia – more than 10C above the seasonal average.Berlin could top 26C on Wednesday and Thursday, while temperatures in the Polish city of Łódź and Albania’s capital, Tirana, could climb past 28C, a sharp departure from typical mid-April conditions.The warm spell follows Europe’s hottest March on record, according to the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Experts say this may signal a challenging summer, with an increased risk of severe heatwaves and wildfires across the continent.Over the weekend, Storm Olivier swept across the Canary Islands, lashing tourist hotspots such as Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura. Lanzarote was hit particularly hard and received 60mm of rainfall on Saturday. Homes and streets were flooded with muddy water that triggered widespread power outages and flight cancellations.Spanish authorities declared a state of emergency after more than 300 weather-related incidents.Recovery efforts are under way, with emergency crews using pumps to drain flood waters and begin repairs.With the Easter holidays in full swing for many travellers, Storm Olivier has caused significant disruption across the region.Explore more on these topicsItalyWeather trackerGermanySpainEuropeanalysisShareReuse this content"

It added that the investigation had focused on “individuals suspected of using confidential information – specifically advance knowledge of the proposed election date – to gain an unfair advantage in betting markets”.Such actions are a criminal offence of cheating under section 42 of the Gambling Act 2005, it added.Claims that Williams and others may have sought to game the betting markets with advance notion of the 4 July date were deeply embarrassing for the Conservatives at the time.It subsequently emerged that as many as seven Metropolitan police officers were under investigation over bets on the election timing. However, it is understood that only one former officer, Jeremy Hunt, 55, is among the 15 charged.The others named by the commission were: Simon Chatfield, 51, of Farnham, Surrey, a former chief marketing officer for the Conservative party; Amy Hind, 34, of Loughton, Essex; Anthony Hind, 36, of Loughton, Essex; Thomas James, 38, of Brecon; Charlotte Lang, 36, of Brixton, south London; Iain Makepeace, 47, of Newcastle upon Tyne; Paul Place, 53, of Hammersmith, west London; James Ward, 40, of Leytonstone, east London; and Jacob Willmer, 39, of Richmond, south-west London.A Conservative spokesperson said any party staff members who had been charged had been suspended from their roles, adding: “These incidents took place in May last year. Our party is now under new leadership and we are cooperating fully with the Gambling Commission.”The commission has the powers to pursue and prosecute its own investigations over alleged gambling-related offences. The Met police held its own parallel inquiry into claims of betting on the election date, but this was discontinued.Ellie Reeves, the Labour MP who is chair of the party, said: “This is a very serious development. The British people will expect that anyone found guilty of wrongdoing faces the full force of the law. Kemi Badenoch must make crystal clear that anyone found guilty of using insider information to cheat the system to try to enrich themselves has no place in the Conservative party.”Around the same time that the allegations first emerged, the then Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, said he had placed three bets on various dates for the election – but said this was done without any knowledge, and that he was not being investigated.A Labour candidate in the general election was also suspended in connection with betting, but over a separate issue.Kevin Craig, who was standing for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, apologised for betting that he would not win in the constituency, calling this “a huge mistake”.Labour said it would return £100,000 he had donated to the party under Keir Starmer’s leadership.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It said the offer also failed to address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers.Graham said: “The rejection of the offer is no surprise as these workers simply cannot afford to take pay cuts of this magnitude to pay the price for bad decision after bad decision.”She called on the government to intervene and bring stakeholders together to end the strike, as well as “urgently consider Unite’s proposal for debt restructure atBirminghamcity council and other local authorities”.“Unite has set out simple and reasonable steps to the council to resolve these issues. It is important to remember that this dispute is not about a pay rise, it is about preventing serious pay cuts,” she said.Wendy Morton, a Conservative MP whose Aldridge-Brownhills constituency is in the Walsall borough, said rats in Birmingham, which she referred to as “squeaky blinders”, “must be dancing in the streets”.She said: “This really shows yet again Labour-led Birmingham council and this Labour government are failing residents and our region. They need to get a grip, stop blaming others, and face the unions – their paymasters.”Earlier on Monday,the government said military personnel with “operational planning expertise”had been brought into help the council clear rubbish from the streets.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, said: “There’s no boots on the ground, let me be very clear. We’ve deployed a couple of army logistics to help with the logistical operation of clearing up the rubbish.“We’ve got over two-thirds of the rubbish cleared off the streets now … I’m very pleased about that. The kids are off school, obviously it’s Easter holidays, we want that rubbish cleared.”In March, the Labour-run Birmingham city council declared a major incident after 17,000 tonnes of uncollected rubbish were left on the streets, with striking workers being blamed for holding up bin lorries on the picket line.The council said 1,500 tonnes of waste a day were now being cleared, with about 100-120 refuse collection vehicles out every day, prioritising 15 of the worst-affected wards.The dispute centres on the council’s decision to cut a role from its waste service, which the union says will leave a number of workers with an £8,000-a-year pay cut.The council has repeatedly disputed this figure and said only 17 workers would be affected. It also said all workers had been offered alternative jobs on the same pay grade in other areas of the council, as well as the opportunity to train to become a driver.A spokesperson for Birmingham city council said: “It is incredibly disappointing that despite several weeks of extensive negotiations, Unite have rejected a second offer of settlement. However, our door remains open.“The council must deliver improved waste services for our citizens, who simply deserve better. We must also guard against future equal pay claims, and while we have sought throughout the negotiations to protect pay for individuals, Unite’s proposals focus solely on retaining a role that does not exist in other councils and represents an equal pay risk for Birmingham.”Explore more on these topicsBirminghamWasteLocal governmentIndustrial actionTrade unionsLocal politicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

There has also been unease over the original decision to hand the administration of the scheme to officials from the department that was responsible for the scandal.‘I didn’t trust the system’: lasting trauma of Windrush victim barred from UK for 10 yearsRead moreThe minister for migration and citizenship,Seema Malhotra, said officials now recognised that some of those affected by the Home Office debacle, which classified thousands of legal UK residents as immigration offenders, had felt unwilling to engage with the department following the scandal. That led to some choosing not to make compensation claims.The new fund would help people who may also still feel wary about contacting theHome Officeto request documentation to show their immigration status is in order.“People are very fearful about coming forward to the status schemes or the compensation scheme, because of the traumatising nature of their experiences, so that it still feels too raw to be able to approach the Home Office,” Malhotra said.She was speaking after a roundtable event in Manchester on Friday with victims, and community leaders who have been assisting with the complex compensation process, so far mostly for free. The fund, which will be released over three years, will help subsidise some of the cost of that work.Home Office spent £22,000 on failed attempt to stop Windrush report releaseRead more“It’s a real imperative that we reach out to those who have lost all their trust in the Home Office, to make sure that they understand the Home Office is serious about righting these wrongs and making sure that we tackle all the barriers that are stopping people coming forward,” Malhotra said.The launch was the latest in a three-pronged reset of the Home Office’s response to the scandal, which triggered catastrophic consequences for many of those affected, some of whom were sacked from their jobs, evicted from their homes, or lost access to benefits and NHS healthcare. A smaller number of people were arrested, detained and deported.In the autumn the home secretary re-established a Windrush unit, dedicated to making sure officials learned long-term lessons from their mistakes. The unit had been shut down by the then home secretary, Suella Braverman, in 2023, a move widely seen as premature because the departmental reforms promised by successive home secretaries had yet to be implemented.The Home Office is recruiting an independent Windrush commissioner, who will scrutinise its progress towards resolving outstanding issues, to ensure the scandal cannot be repeated.Campaigners have asked for the compensation scheme to be taken away from the Home Office and given to an independent organisation, although officials say such a move would cause new delays six years after its launch. Requests for legal aid have been denied. Community advocates told the minister that assisting with a claim could take more than 20 hours of staff time, and expressed doubt about how much extra work could be paid for by the fund.Malhotra, who has participated in 15 Windrush-related events since taking office and four in the past week, was met warmly, with advocates saying they were cautiously hopeful about the government’s commitment to improving its response. Delays in processing claims have been falling; two years ago there was a backlog of 2,500 claims being processed and this had dropped to 582 in February. Since 2019 the Home Office has paid out about £108m in compensation across 3,155 Windrush claims.Malhotra said the process of learning the lessons of Windrush needed to lead to “wider work on tackling barriers to opportunity”. She promised to address wider injustices experienced by the Windrush generation, in education, health and housing, as part of a commitment to improve the government’s response to the scandal. The Windrush unit would work with the government’s new race equality engagement group to look at wider inequalities, she said.Explore more on these topicsWindrush scandalImmigration and asylumCommonwealth immigrationHome OfficeSeema MalhotranewsShareReuse this content"

The entire time they’ve done trial by media. My lawyers proactively wrote to the Bangladeshi authorities, they never responded.“I’m sure you’ll understand I can’t dignify this politically motivated smear campaign with any … comments. It’s a completely politically motivated smear campaign, trying to harass me. There is no evidence that I’ve done anything wrong.”According to Bangladeshi media reports, a judge issued the warrant for 53 people connected to Sheikh Hasina, Siddiq’s aunt, whostepped down and left the countryin August last year after a violent crackdown on protests.There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh.A representative for Siddiq said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The family are all based in Britain.Explore more on these topicsLabourBangladeshSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

The attacker used a makeshift sharp weapon fashioned out of metal during the sustained attack, as well as cooking fat. One officer suffered third degree burns.After the incident, the government announced measures to increase safety in the facility, one of which was thebanning of some of the most dangerous offendersfrom the prison cooking area.Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the Prison Officers’ association (POA), said staff were furious, and many had been traumatised by the injuries their colleagues had suffered, with two still in hospital.He said inmates had access to meals in keeping with their dietary requirements, and should not have been allowed access to a kitchen where dangerous utensils were stored.Fairhurst said: “You are giving them the resources to fashion weapons and attack staff. Especially the ideological prisoners, who will not change.”The union had repeatedly called for stab vests for its members. One guard is said to have suffered five stab wounds to their torso, damage which the POA said could have been limited by the availability of vests.The Guardian understands that also housed in the unit wasAnjem Choudary,serving life imprisonment after being convicted in 2024 of directing a terrorist organisation, membership of a proscribed organisation, and encouraging support for a terrorist organisation.He is believed to have been in the prison gym at the time of the attack, and in 2016was convicted of supporting Islamic State.Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into the attacks, with the separation unit used to house extremist prisoners believed to pose a danger of radicalising others.Detectives have been able to speak to the three prison officers who were attacked, but only briefly to the two male ones who suffered the worst injuries and who as of Monday, were still in hospital. Their lives are not believed to be in danger, and the injured female prison officer has been released.Fairhurst said: “Staff are traumatised and angry. It has affected them as they were such horrific assaults on their colleagues.”One line of inquiry is whether the attacks were premeditated. Fairhurst said that until the weekend, Abedi had shown no signs of trouble, and that detectives were searching the jail for where the metal used to make the knife-like weapon came from, alongside any Islamist propaganda.After the attacks, the prison service suspended permission for inmates on separation units to access kitchens and the sharp equipment they contain. The Ministry of Justice, responsible for prisons in England and Wales, would not say where Abedi is located.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This avoids detectives being under time limits to complete vital stages of their investigation, and any risk their suspect poses is mitigated as he is already behind bars and is also isolated.Families of five of the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb – Megan Hurley, Eilidh Macleod, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Curry, and Kelly Brewster – wrote to the government describing their “absolute disbelief” at the attack, demanding Abedi be placed in permanent solitary confinement.The BBCreported the letter, which said: “He should not be allowed any privileges whatsoever while serving a sentence for the deaths of 22 innocent lives and the injuring of many more.“He should not have access to anything that he can weaponise, such as hot oil or items he can turn into blades.”Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said: “The prime minister is appalled by the attack that we saw at the weekend, and his thoughts with the officers involved. It’s clear that something went terribly wrong in the management of this offender and the government has committed to carry out an investigation to urgently get answers.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:“We’ve already taken immediate action to suspend access to kitchens in separation and close supervision centres. We will also launch a full independent review into how this attack was able to happen.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationTrade unionsUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

It says it is working hard to fix this, but that industry-wide collaboration and government intervention are needed.Describing itself as “the ultimate virtual universe”, Roblox features millions of games and interactive environments, known collectively as “experiences”. Some of the content is developed by Roblox, but much of it is user-generated. In 2024, the platform had more than 85 million daily active users, an estimated 40% of whom are under 13.While the company said it “deeply sympathised” with parents whose children came to harm on the platform, it said “tens of millions of people have a positive, enriching and safe experience on Roblox every day”.However, inan investigation shared with the Guardian, the digital-behaviour experts Revealing Reality discovered “something deeply disturbing … a troubling disconnect between Roblox’s child-friendly appearance and the reality of what children experience on the platform”.View image in fullscreenA young Roblox user customises her avatar.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersRevealing Reality created multiple Roblox accounts, registering them to fictional users aged five, nine, 10, 13 and 40-plus. The accounts interacted only with one another, and not with users outside the experiment, to ensure their avatars’ behaviours were not influenced in any way.Despitenew tools launched last weekaimed at giving parents more control over their children’s accounts, the researchers concluded: “Safety controls that exist are limited in their effectiveness and there are still significant risks for children on the platform.”The report found that children as young as five were able to communicate with adults while playing games on the platform, and found examples of adults and children interacting with no effective age verification. This was despite Roblox changing its settings last November so that accounts listed as belonging to under-13s can no longer directly message others outside of games or experiences, instead having access only to public broadcast messages.The report also found the avatar belonging to the 10-year-old’s account could access “highly suggestive environments”. These included a hotel space where they could view a female avatar wearing fishnet stockings gyrating on a bed and other avatars lying on top of each other in sexually suggestive poses, and a public bathroom space where characters were urinating and avatars could choose fetish accessories to dress up in.1:00Club role-play hangout open to 10-year-old avatars – videoResearchers found that their test avatars overheard conversations between other players verbalising sexual activity, as well as repeated slurping, kissing and grunting noises, when using the voice chat function. Roblox says that all voice chat – which is available to phone-verified accounts registered as belonging to users aged 13 and above – is subject to real-time AI moderation.They also found that a test avatar registered to an adult was able to ask for the five-year-old test avatar’s Snapchat details using barely coded language. Though Roblox says in-game text chat is subject to built-in filters and moderation, the report says this is an example of how easily such measures can be circumvented, creating opportunities for predatory behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We continually evolve our policies, technologies, and moderation efforts to protect our community, especially young people. This includes investing in advanced safety tools, working closely with experts and empowering parents and caregivers with robust controls and resources.“In 2024 alone, we added more than 40 new safety enhancements, and we remain fully committed to going further to make Roblox a safe and civil place for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsChildren's techInternet safetyGamesOnline multiplayer gamesChildrenParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

He believes his is an important message to disseminate. He needs the volume that he uses to get the message across from Parliament Street to the Palace of Westminster.”Woodcock continued: “He says that his strategy needs pictures of him in the media and he’s spent many hours campaigning and has never been arrested, his relations with police are generally good.”The judge added: “His equipment operates on battery power and is limited.”Of the issues Bray protests about, the judge continued: “He is described, virtually accused of being ‘fixated’ – he’s entitled to be. How he chooses to express those views is a matter for him.”He added: “Lampooning the government through satire is a long tradition in this country.”The Muppets and Darth Vader themes had been used “as the prime minister came in, which is what we always did for Rishi – apparently he’s a Star Wars fan”, Bray had previously told the court.Bray had told police their map illustrating where he could not use the speakers was incorrect, the court heard.Body-worn footage featured Bray, wearing a yellow and blue top hat, repeatedly telling police: “You’ve got the wrong map.” He said it was outdated and officers would learn that by asking someone higher up in the chain of command.When told he was not allowed to play there, Bray stuck his fingers in his ears and said: “No it’s not, it’s not, not here – it’s not wrong here,” the court heard.“I know what I can’t do,” he said, suggesting officers stick it “where the sun don’t shine” before lighting a cigarette and looking away.Several witnesses described to the court the negative impact of Bray’s music, heard as high as the sixth floor in nearby buildings, after which the defendant apologised.Bray is known for playing music in protest around Westminster, includingD:Ream’s Things Can Only Get Betterat the gates of Downing Street when Sunak announced the general election in the pouring rain last May.Explore more on these topicsLondonProtestConservativesBrexitRishi SunakPolicenewsShareReuse this content"

For those who survive an attack, the risk of another one is highest in the first year because blood vessels are more sensitive, making it easier for blood clots to develop.Researchers atImperial College Londonand Lund University in Sweden found that by giving heart attack patients two drugs together – statins and ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering drug – their risk of another heart attack, stroke or death was reduced.“This study shows that we could save lives and reduce further heart attacks by giving patients a combination of two low-cost drugs,” said Prof Kausik Ray, of Imperial’s School of Public Health.“But at the moment patients across the world aren’t receiving these drugs together. That is causing unnecessary and avoidable heart attacks and deaths – and also places unnecessary costs on healthcare systems.“Our study shows the way forward. Care pathways must now change for patients after this type of heart event.”Researchers analysed patient data to measure the potential impact of the dual combination of drugs.They compared patients who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack, those who were given statins with ezetimibe added between 13 weeks and 16 months, and others who got just statins with no ezetimibe at all.Data from 36,000 Swedish patients who had a heart attack between 2015 and 2022 was analysed, and advanced statistical models were used to emulate a clinical trial.Those who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack and were able to lower cholesterol to the target level early had a better prognosis and less risk of new cardiovascular events and death than those who received the add-on treatment later, or not at all, according to the study.“Our findings suggest that a simple change in treatment guidelines could have a huge impact on patients,” said Ray.“Ezetimibe is already widely available and prescribed for relatively low cost. This add-on therapy could be rolled out for around £350 a year per patient, which is a huge cost saving compared to the lasting impacts of treating heart attacks and the impact they have on patients’ lives.”Margret Leosdottir, an associate professor at Lund University and a senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden, said she hoped the findings would lead to changes in global guidelines, in order to “prevent unnecessary suffering and save lives”.Leosdottir said the combination therapy was currently not typically offered to heart attack patients globally because a “precautionary principle” was applied to avoid side-effects and overmedication.“However, there are positive effects from applying both medicines as soon after the infarction [heart attack] as possible. Not doing this entails an increased risk. In addition, the drug we have examined in the study causes few side-effects and is readily available and inexpensive in many countries.”Explore more on these topicsMedical researchHeart attackStrokeHeart diseaseStatinsDrugsImperial College LondonnewsShareReuse this content"

The couple’s son, a university academic, lives inHong Kong, and they were visiting to see their three-month-old grandson.“And at the end of about three hours, my husband was told he was free to go but I was denied entry, and I was going to go back on the next plane home,” Hobhouse said.The Bath MP said that while she tried to be “cooperative and friendly” in the expectation she would eventually be allowed in, on being told she could not, she “slightly lost it” and demanded an explanation, but was told only: “We are so sorry, Madam, we understand.”She said: “No explanation was given to me, ever. And this is what is so chilling, and should really be a wake-up call for any parliamentarian, because I had no warning that I was on the blacklist.”China has in the past publiclybanned several British MPsfrom entering the country, including Iain Duncan Smith and Nusrat Ghani who, like Hobhouse, are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac).Ipac is an international group of politicians that scrutinises Beijing’s approach to human rights and has criticised the crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong.Hobhouse said her apparent presence on “a sort of hidden blacklist” appeared likely to be connected to her membership of Ipac.“I’m a member of Ipac,” she said. “Ipac is watching the human rights adherence, or not, of the Chinese Communist party, but I’m not more outspoken than other MPs about criticising the Chinese Communist party.“Therefore anybody who ultimately is seen as standing up for freedom, democracy and human rights should feel that they are going to be targeted by the Chinese authorities. And that is really, really chilling.”Asked how she felt personally about not being able to see her grandchild, Hobhouse said it was “depressing”. She said: “There are many, many more tragedies that are far, far worse, but I am sad.”Asked about Hobhouse’s case by Sky, Murray said: “We are very concerned about this. We need to find out exactly what happened. And I know that the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, who is in China at the moment, has raised this with authorities there.“Clearly, it would not be right to prevent a British MP from entering another country purely on the basis of what they had said as a parliamentarian.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsHong KongChinaAsia PacificHuman rightsCommunismFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

It promises to be a blend “the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas” with the “grit of iconic pool halls”, adding another player to thebooming activity bar market.The venue, which is being backed by investors including the US-based venture capital firm Sharp Alpha Advisors and the Daily Mail investment arm, dmg ventures, uses pool tables, balls and cues from the traditional game but adds tracking technology and video projections to add bonus targets and obstacles in an attempt to appeal to larger groups.Alongside its own venues and those operated by franchise partners, Poolhouse plans to sell its equipment to pubs, bars and other venues that want to update their existing pool tables.Steve Jolliffe said: “Today, more people play at Topgolf than on traditional golf courses in the US, and we aim to make an even greater impact on the world of pool. While we have a strong track record, this project has been our most challenging endeavour yet.”In the UK, the activity bar trend began with bowling and cocktails venue All Star Lanes, which opened in London in 2006, followed by table tennis venue Bounce six years later. It has been supercharged by the hunt for social-media friendly nights out that can look good on Instagram and TikTok, as well as places that offer something else to punters who drink less or are teetotal.Landlords’ hunt for something to fill space on high streets and in shopping centres vacated by department stores and other shops has also prompted expansion.Bowling, indoor crazy golf and escape rooms are the most widespread concepts, but there are also bars incorporating darts, shuffleboard, table tennis, trampolining, bingo and even axe throwing. The number of venues that provide a mix of activities has more than quadrupled in the last five years, despite a difficult period during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the property consultancy Savills, which has predicted further growth.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Winfrey remarked that, for King, “this is bigger than just going to space” and “more than just overcoming fear”.“Life is about continuing into grow into the fullest expression of yourself,” Winfrey said.The talkshow queen could later be seen rubbing her eyes as the rocket reached its maximum ascent velocity of 2,300mph – or Mach 3. A commentator remarked that the vehicle was rising into the atmosphere ahead of “a stream of steam”.As the rocket reached its highest point, about 62 miles (100km) above the Earth, a passenger could be heard to exclaim: “Oh my goddess.” Another could be heard saying: “I love you,Jeff Bezos.”On the way back down to Earth, more screaming could be heard. The capsule, detached from its booster, made a soft landing on the Texas plains, two miles from the launchpad.So Katy Perry went to space. Wasn’t there anyone else we could have sent? | Zoe WilliamsRead more“Congratulations, and welcome back to Earth,” the commentator said. “Everybody just as ecstatic to be back on Earth.”Sánchez’s fiance later opened the hatch to welcome her back to Earth, followed by her crewmates. The billionaire greeted each with a hug and kiss.View image in fullscreenKaty Perry kissed the ground upon return to Earth.Photograph: BLUE ORIGIN/AFP/Getty ImagesPerry, holding a daisy, kissed the ground with King. In a post-flight interview, Sánchez said: “The Earth was so quiet but also really alive. We are all in this together, and some connected. It makes me just want to hug everybody.”“I had to come back,” Sánchez, who is set to marry Bezosthis summer in Venice, added tearfully. “I wanted to come back. I’m getting married.”The alternative, she said, “would be a bummer for me”.On her return to earth, Perry said Monday’s flight had been “the highest high”.“It’s about surrender to the unknown, it’s trust, and this whole journey is about more than going to space,” Perry remarked. It’s up there with meditation.“This is up there.”She added: “What you’re doing is really finding the love for yourself. I’m really feeling that divine feminine right now.”Perry, 40, said last week she was listening to an audiobook of Cosmos by Carl Sagan and reading a book on string theory in preparation for the ride.“I’ve always been interested in astrophysics and interested in astronomy and astrology and the stars,” she told the Associated Press. “We are all made of stardust, and we all come from the stars.”The pop star also said that she planned to channel “that feminine divine that I was born with” to prepare for the new experience.Before liftoff, King – who co-hosts CBS Mornings – said she was approaching the rocket trip with trepidation. “I still get very uncomfortable when people say ‘astronaut’,” she said. “I in no means feel like an astronaut. They said: ‘But, Gayle, if you go to space, you’re an astronaut.”The pair, along with the former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen and film producer Kerianne Flynn, traveled as the guests of Sánchez.The flight was the 11th human flight for the New Shepard program, which has flown 52 people, including repeat astronauts, to the Kármán line.Some critics have questioned whether the all-female trip is a moment of feminist progress since it comes as promotion for Bezos’s space tourism business that, in turn, is the marketing arm of Blue Origin’s commercial launch program.The US actor Olivia Munn called the trip “a bit gluttonous” during a guest hosting appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends on CBS rival NBC.“I know this is not the cool thing to say, but there are so many other things that are so important in the world right now,” Munn said. “What are you guys going to do up in space?”Explore more on these topicsBlue OriginKaty PerrySpaceJeff BezosnewsShareReuse this content"

It accused his government of putting the lives of soldiers and the hostages at risk for his own political gain.Critics have alleged that Netanyahu’s decision to return to war in Gaza wasdriven by a need to appease the far-right parties in his coalition, who have threatened to bring down his government if he does not completely crush Hamas.“The war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests,” said the letter.The letter was first published and publicly signed last week by almost 1,000 reservists and retired officers from Israel’s air force, which has been at the forefront of the continued assault onGaza.It prompted a vehement response from Netanyahu, who said it was written by “an extreme fringe group that is once again trying to break Israeli society from within” and ordered the dismissal of all the active-duty reservists who had signed it.Several similar statements were successively made in support, including by reservists from Israel’s elite Unit 8200, the biggest military intelligence unit, and hundreds of reservist doctors.On Monday, another public letter signed by more than 1,500 former and current armoured corps soldiers and paratroopers with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), including two former IDF chiefs of staff, called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza.“We are soldiers who have served our country all our lives. We have driven tanks, commanded troops, and paid a heavy price. It is precisely this experience that pushes us today to call for a ceasefire,” said the letter, authored by Col Rami Matan, a former IDF deputy commander, adding: “Why do we continue to sacrifice human lives for unattainable objectives?”View image in fullscreenDrummers at the protest outside the west Jerusalem home of Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer.Photograph: Saeed Qaq/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockIsrael and Hamas have been engaged in negotiations in Cairo, with the involvement of Qatar, Egypt and the US, who have been attempting to broker another ceasefire after the last one collapsed in March and Israel launched a wave of strikes.Reports emerged on Monday that Israel had proposed a deal to Hamas that would see 10 hostages released. According to Tikva Forum, a rightwing group advocating for the hostages, Netanyahu told the father of the hostage Eitan Mor on Sunday that the government was working on a deal that would bring home 10 captives, but gave no further details on the conditions Israel had put forward.A Hamas official who spoke to the Lebanese newspaper Al Mayadeen said Israel had proposed the return of 10 hostages in return for an initial 45-day ceasefire, when the Israeli government’s blockade on aid going into Gaza would be lifted and the IDF would withdraw from Gaza territory it had seized since March.According to the official, Israel and Hamas would also commit to negotiations for a second stage, which is where the previous ceasefire commitments had stalled and ultimately fallen apart. This would include discussions of a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the disarmament of Hamas.Speaking to AFP on Monday, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, accused Israel of obstructing progress towards a ceasefire. He said Hamas was willing “to release all Israeli captives in exchange for a serious prisoner swap deal, an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the entry of humanitarian aid”.However, he made it clear that the disarmament of Hamas was not “up for negotiation”.On Sunday night, hundreds of people, including dozens of family members of former and current hostages, staged a protest outside the home of Ron Dermer, the minister Netanyahu has put in charge of the hostage negotiations, leading to five arrests.In recent days, hostage families have alleged that Dermer, who is one of Netanyahu’s closest advisers, has been delaying and obstructing negotiations in order to suit the government’s political agenda. The Netanyahu government has pushed back at the allegations, stating that it was doing everything to free the hostages.Doron Zektser, the father of the hostage Edan Alexander, addressed Dermer in a statement: “Come out, update us on the situation. That’s your responsibility. If you can’t do the job, resign. He doesn’t speak with the families. They’re rushing to war when it’s clear that only a deal will bring the hostages back.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warThe MossadHamasGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

There are some vulnerabilities though, and earthquakes in this area have led to other dangers, including landslides and liquefaction.TheSan Diegocounty police and sheriff’s departments said they had received no immediate reports of damage or injuries. A county firefighter who answered the phone at the Julian fire station also said there were no reports of damage and no calls for service.California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, said on social media that he had been briefed about the earthquake and wasworking with local respondersto determine whether there had been damage and if there was a need for more emergency response.The earthquake was a test of the state’s “Shake Alert” system, which is designed to warn those who could be affected and give them essential seconds to prepare before shaking starts.Operated by the USGS, the system sends out warnings through cellphone apps, the Android operating system and wireless emergency alert systems. Alerts rang out on phones across the region warning people to drop, cover and hold. In San Diego, roughly 40 miles away from the epicenter, the warnings gave people close to 14 seconds to respond before shaking began.The quake swung light fixtures and rattled shelves in San Diego and was felt as far north as Los Angeles. Riley Ozuna, owner of the Julian Cafe & Bakery, said some cups fell on to the ground at her business. “But everything is OK,” she said.“I thought the single-pane windows were going to crack because they were shaking pretty good, but they didn’t,” said Paul Nelson, the owner of a former goldmine that operated in the 1870s in Julian. He said some picture frames on the counter at the gift shop fell over at the Eagle Mining Co, but the tunnels that tourists can explore suffered no damage.Schoolchildren were escorted outside buildings as a precaution when the ground started moving, said Capt Thomas Shoots of theCaliforniadepartment of forestry and fire protection for San Diego county. He got a shake alert and then started feeling things rolling and banging.“There was a lot of shaking and rattling around,” he said. “But thankfully everything seems to be back to normal.”It was the second earthquake to hit the area in a matter of hours, with a 3.5 magnitude quake that registered around 4pm on Sunday.Monday’s quake struck 8.3 miles (13.4km) deep near the Elsinore fault zone, one of the busiest seismic areas in California and part of the famous San Andreas fault system that usually sees at least one magnitude 4.0 quake every year, according to Lucy Jones, a veteran seismologist in southern California. Jones said that Sunday’s earthquake was a foreshock to Monday’s larger one.Aftershocks also shook the area immediately following the larger quake, with a 3.0 and a 2.5 registered in Julian minutes after the first.The Associated Press contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsCaliforniaEarthquakesWest CoastSan DiegonewsShareReuse this content"

Humanitarian assistance programs and global health funding would be slashed by 54% and 55% respectively, according to the memo, which wasfirst reported by the Washington Post.The memo assumes that USAID, previously an independent agency before it was targeted by Doge, would be encompassed fully under the state department umbrella.There would also be drastic reductions to the state department workforce, which currently stands at 80,000.The memo proposes the elimination of 90% of support for international organizations, with financing for some 20 bodies – including the Nato alliance and the UN – eliminated.Targeted funding for the International Atomic Energy Agency and the International Civil Aviation Authority would continue but backing for international peacekeeping missions would end, according to the memo, citing unspecified “recent mission failures”.The cuts would also see the foreign service travel budget and benefits for staff severely curtailed, while the Fulbright scholarship, established by Congress in 1946 and which has facilitated educational exchanges involving more than 40 future heads of state or government, would be eliminated.So too would Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations, which aims to anticipate and prevent wars around the globe.The cuts are yet to be agreed within the administration and would need to be approved by Congress, where they would be likely to encounter stiff resistance, even among many Republicans.The memo, dated 10 April, is signed by Douglas Pitkin, director of budget and planning at the state department, and Peter Marocco, who was until recently the department’s director of foreign assistance and acting deputy director of USAID.Marco Rubio, the secretary of state – who has hitherto favored an activist US role in international affairs – has until Tuesday to respond, the memo says.Chris Van Hollen, the ranking Democrat on the state department and USAID subcommittee of the Senate foreign relations committee, criticized the proposals as “an unserious budget”.“I predict it will hit a wall of bipartisan opposition,” he told the Post.The American Foreign Service Association called on Congress to reject any budget proposing cuts outlined in the memo, which it called “reckless and dangerous”. The cuts suggested “would empower adversaries like China and Russia who are eager to fill the void left by a retreating United States”, the association said.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The fee was colloquially referred to as “the coffee for the gravedigger”, implying that in exchange for the favour, an extra sum had to be paid.“People were forced to pay in cash for faster burials,” said the police. “During the course of the investigation, no fewer than 25 cases of illicit burials were documented.”Police found that the municipal gravedigger hindered an outside company brought in to manage the services, instead directing three mortuaries with whom he conspired to carry out burials, exhumations and the transfers of remains, in exchange for a percentage of the profit.Police are still investigating what became of the removed corpses.Cemeteries and funeral parlours are often controlled by the mafia in areas of Italy where those criminal organisations are entrenched.Two weeks ago, the former custodian of the cemetery of Tropea, in the southern Italian region of Calabria, was sentenced to five years in prison, with three years and six months handed to his son, for operating what reports called a “cemetery of horrors”.The pair, caught in the act by hidden cameras set up by police in the cemetery, were charged with conspiracy, grave violation, desecration of a corpse, illicit disposal of special cemetery waste, and embezzlement.The coffins were smashed with a pickaxe, the corpses stripped, and jewels removed with saws and hammers. A video seen by the Guardian shows bodies being disposed of in black plastic bags and thrown into rubbish bins or burned.A lack of tombs and spaces for urns in cemeteries has become a serious emergency, especially in southernItaly, where the coffins of the dead sometimes lie piled up in warehouses for years. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the crisis.In 2021, in Caltanissetta, Sicily, authorities drew up a lottery to bury bodies in the few graves left free.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsItalyDeath and dyingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In 2023, more than 2 million people received healthcare through Title X, which helps people regardless of income, age or citizenship status. For many, Title X is their only source of healthcare.But the future of the decades-old program is now in limbo.On 31 March, the Trump administration notified 16 Title X providers that their funds would be temporarily withheld “pending a compliance review”, a US Department of Health and Human Services official told the Guardian. Title X programs had just 10 days – until Thursday 10 April – to turn over documentation for the review. Yet multiple Title X providers told the Guardian that they have not heard anything from the Trump administration since submitting their documentation.Seven states currently have no Title X funding, while another 16 states have lost most or some Title X dollars, according to the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents the majority of Title X providers. In total, the funding freeze affects clinics that, in 2023, served about 846,000 people.As Title X clinics often operate with razor-thin margins, this delay in funding could prove catastrophic, Title X providers said.“If these funds are not released, many clinics are going to be facing the decision to either significantly reduce their staff and services or close their doors altogether,” said Michelle Trupiano, executive director of Missouri Family Health Council Inc, which handles Title X funding for 52 clinics scattered across Missouri.“Once a clinic lays off staff or closes their doors, it’s almost impossible to open them again.”If Title X funding is not restored by the end of the month, Trupiano said, clinics in Missouri may have to cut their staff, hours and services.Some providers have just two weeks’ worth of reserve funding, said Clare Coleman, CEO of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. Among some providers, changes – such as charging for care that would previously have been free – may come as early as this week.The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment on when Title X providers may expect to learn more about their withheld funding.Many of the notices sent to the Title X providers with frozen funding accuse the providers of being potentially engaged “in widespread practices across hiring, operations, and patient treatment that ‘unavoidably employ race in a negative manner’” as well as possibly violating a Trump administration executive order prohibiting “taxpayer subsidization of open borders”.Missouri Family Health Council, which handles funding for the 52 Title X clinics scattered across Missouri, was cited for a 2023 job posting that mentioned “diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging”, Trupiano said.Converge, which deals with funding for 120 Title X clinics in Mississippi and Tennessee, was cited for a 2020 statement that, in the wake of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor’s deaths, affirmed that Converge’s leaders were “committed to having honest, on-going, challenging, and courageous conversations about how our work is addressing systemic racism in reproductive health care”, according to documents viewed by the Guardian.Nine Planned Parenthood affiliates that receive Title X funding were cited for their mission statements as well as public documents that emphasize a “commitment to Black communities”,Politico reported.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In 2023, 85% of the 2.8 million people who sought care through Title X were women, and 48% identified as a race other than white.The Trump administration should have at least given Title X providers time to amend their funding applications to come into compliance with the administration’s new policies, Coleman said.“In no letter does it suggest that there’s something inside the application for funds itself that is problematic,” she said. “This is just not on the level.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHealthcare industryReproductive rightsUS politicsContraception and family planningCancerRacenewsShareReuse this content"

I was convinced it was terrible – but we showed it at Cannes and they went crazy. Audiences had never seen a character like that treated sympathetically’Interviews by Simon BlandMon 14 Apr 2025 10.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 17.31 EDTSharePJ Hogan, writer and directorThe kernel of the story was my family, and my sister’s stormy relationship with our dad. He was a local politician and, like Trump, obsessed with success. I’m one of seven and my sister and I are the oldest. To use my dad’s language, we were the most useless because we wanted to be artists and so were unemployable. He was very dismissive of us.I managed to get to film school but my sister was stuck at home. My dad got her a job selling cosmetics but everyone knew the woman employing her was his mistress. Suddenly my sister disappeared, and it turned out she hadn’t been making money from the job at all, she’d just been robbing my dad and pretending she was doing well in the job.Toni Collette never judged Muriel – her performance took the character to a level that shocked meSix months later she contacted me. She’d been living in Sydney. She said, “I suppose you’re mad at me?” I said, “No. You had to get out.” I thought there was something very moving about her story and asked her permission to tell it. She said OK but made me promise one thing: that she’d be a heroine.I identify with Mike Leigh films. He’s a truth teller. I wanted to do an Australian version. Nobody wanted to make the film. They all said the same thing: “Nobody wants to see a girl who’s not only unlikable and inarticulate but plus-sized, a thief and a liar.” I tried a draft where Muriel doesn’t steal the money but it felt wrong. I decided to down torpedoes, return to the original and find someone crazy enough to make it.I went to film school with Jane Campion, and she got it made. We had sent the script to the company that financed her film The Piano – they were going to turn us down but I called Jane and said it’d really help if you send a message to the head of the company telling them I might be able to make a decent film. I owe her my career.Many actors didn’t want to play Muriel. But Toni Collette never judged her; she got her on a deep level. One of the earliest scenes we shot was when Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) confronts Muriel in a wedding store while she’s trying on dresses. The emotional rawness of the scene still hits me. Toni was utterly vulnerable and emotionally naked. She took it to another level that shocked me. I could see Muriel’s desperation, loneliness and self-hatred.I was convinced it was a terrible movie but we showed it at the Cannes film festival and they went crazy. I made it for Australian audiences so it amazes me that it crosses oceans. There’s something universal about Muriel. I think it was validating for people from dysfunctional families or who had to do a Muriel thing to escape. Audiences had never seen anybody like her treated sympathetically.Rachel Griffiths, played RhondaRhonda was based on a Sicilian Australian friend of mine who’s relentlessly positive and absolutely believes in everyone. My job was to be the first person Muriel had ever met who saw something in her that no one around her did, and who believed in her so passionately that she could believe in herself. I think that’s why people love Rhonda. We all dream of having that friend.I was in awe of Toni. She was unashamed to portray those ugly, nasty, weird feelings that young women feel they shouldn’t have. To put them on screen is such an insanely vulnerable and almost political thing. The truthfulness of awkward, icky, girl feelings didn’t fit the female narrative. We all get that now but it was pretty radical when the film was released. It’s another reason why it hasn’t aged.Singing Abba with Toni, and having that exquisite chemistry with another person when you know something beautiful is being communicated, the audience is with you and you’re harmonising and feeding off each other? To this day, it’s in my top five days at the office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That look we gave each other had been utterly earned by making the film together. It’s so open, loving, beautiful, hopeful, shared and stupid … I get a little teary whenever I watch it because it’s so real. That’s friendship.Muriel’s Wedding review – Toni Collette is outstanding in the film that brought Abba backRead moreDespite the fact Muriel is desperate to get married, the film passes the Bechdel test – it is really about female friendships and the family you make for yourself – especially if you’re from one that has some toxic, fucked up elements.I was in New York once and a gay man told me what the film meant to him and gave me a whole thesis about how Muriel’s Wedding was not only a metaphor for LGBTQ+ people growing up in small-minded places but also for the Aids crisis. When you or your best friend get sick and are dragged back to the judgmental place where you’re not seen or loved – like Rhonda is – that was every gay man in New York’s deepest fear. Being cut off from their new family. It really blew my mind.So many people would come up to Toni and say, “Oh my God, I’m Muriel!” Sharon Stone has told her it! There’s something so universal about that feeling of falling short of what society thinks you can and should be.Muriel’s Wedding the Musical is at Curve theatre, Leicester, until 10 May.

For others, a new TV adaptation is an opportunity for greater detail and faithfulness to JK Rowling’s magical seven-book series.Much of the guessing and speculation can be put to rest now, asHBOhas made its first official casting announcement for some of the wizarding world’s most notable characters in its forthcoming Harry Potter series.The company announced on Monday that John Lithgow would play Albus Dumbledore,Paapa Essieduwould be Severus Snape, Janet McTeer would be Minerva McGonagall, and Nick Frost would appear as Rubeus Hagrid. All four actors will be series regulars.Meanwhile, Luke Thallon was announced to play Quirinus Quirrell andPaul Whitehouseto play Argus Filch, both in guest and recurring roles.The series, designed to run for more than a decade, comes from the writer and showrunner Francesca Gardiner and director and executive producer Mark Mylod of Succession.“We are happy to announce the casting of John Lithgow,Janet McTeer, Paapa Essiedu, Nick Frost, Luke Thallon and Paul Whitehouse to play Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Hagrid, Quirrell and Filch,” the pair said. “We’re delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can’t wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life.”View image in fullscreenJK Rowling is an executive producer of the TV series.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThe US actor Lithgow, who most recently starred in the Bafta- and Oscar-winning papal election thriller Conclave, will take over the role played by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon in the films. Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is a caring and powerful wizard who mentors Harry in his fight against the dark lord Voldemort.It hadpreviously been reportedthat Mark Rylance was in the running for the part. But Lithgow – a veteran of stage and screen, and winner of six Emmy awards (including for his role as Winston Churchill in The Crown), two Golden Globes, an Olivier and a Tony –announced his own castingin February.Essiedu received an Emmy nomination for his role in the critically acclaimed series I May Destroy You and also starred in series such as The Lazarus Project and Gangs of London. He will transform into the Hogwarts potions professor Snape, who was played by Alan Rickman in the films. Harry Potter is constantly at odds with Snape, who is hostile to him but is later revealed to have been bullied by Harry’s father, James, while harbouring an unrequited love for his mother, Lily.McTeer, a past winner of numerous accolades including a Tony, an Olivier and a Golden Globe, will be McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor house – a role played by Maggie Smith in the films. McTeer has appeared in films including Tumbleweeds, Wuthering Heights and The Menu.View image in fullscreenCillian Murphy has been rumoured to be in the frame to play Voldemort.Photograph: Kyle Grillot/EPAMeanwhile Frost, best known for his roles in the comedy films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, will take over from Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, the Hogwarts groundskeeper and half-giant who becomes a faithful friend and ally to Harry and his friends.The new casting announcement will undoubtedly draw much reaction from Potter fans.There had already been divisionafter rumours first emerged that Essiedu was being considered to play Snape, who is described in the books as having “greasy, shoulder-length black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin”. Others were concerned that a US star had been cast to play Dumbledore.The casting for the trio of main characters – Harry, Hermione and Ron – is yet to be announced, though it is likely they will be played by newcomers after Warner Broslaunched an open casting callfor children aged between nine and 11 last autumn. There have also been rumours that Cillian Murphy is beingconsidered to play Voldemort.According to HBO, the series will be a “faithful adaptation” of the books by Rowling, who serves as an executive producer. With a new cast, the show will delve into more detail than the eight feature films spawned by the epic franchise, released between 2001 and 2011.The series will be “full of the fantastic detail, much-loved characters and dramatic locations that Harry Potter fans have loved for over 25 years”, Max, the newly branded streaming service for HBO, promised in a statement upon theseries announcementin April 2023.“Each season will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core of the franchise and available to watch globally.”Rowling has ownership over key aspects of the Harry Potter intellectual property, including the characters. But her involvement in the show has been divisive because of her opinions about trans people, which have drawn criticism from some of the franchise’s original stars. The writer’s expansive Harry Potter world – including the books, films, video games and theatre – isworth an estimated £20bn($26bn).At London’s Kings Cross station, site of the fictional platform 9 and ¾, fans were ambivalent about the cast.“As someone who grew up with the books, I’m looking forward to seeing what they’ve created,” said 25-year-old Grace Whitehill from London. “But at the same time, I don’t want my experience to be ruined if they create something that’s too far from whatJK Rowlingoriginally wrote.”Banker Jaston Fernandes, 25, agreed. “I think my only concern is I don’t want it to tarnish the legacy of what it’s been,” he said. “I’ve not seen the Cursed Child because I think it’s perfect as it is. I don’t want to touch it.”Fans were also quick to address the backlash faced by the casting of Essiedu as Snape. “[Essiedu] is not the problem – he’s a good actor in everything he does,” said Aurelia Jumeaucourt, a 30-year-old consultant from Paris. “The problem is people. As long as he’s a good actor, I don’t care what he looks like.”“Sometimes the fandom can be quite toxic,” said Whitehill, who has left many of the social media groups she was once part of. “It’s really lovely when you meet the right people, but sometimes it can get very cultish.”The series isexpected to debuton Max and the HBO and Warner Bros Discovery streaming service in 2026, almost 30 years after the first book in Rowling’s bestselling series was published in 1997, and 15 years after the final film landed on screens.Explore more on these topicsHarry PotterJK RowlingJohn LithgowPaapa EssieduNick FrostJanet McTeerPaul WhitehousenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the story of socially awkward freelance games journalist, Cameron Walker, who steals the code to a new virtual pet sim named Thronglets from the developer he’s meant to be interviewing. When he gets the game home, he realises the cute, intelligent little critters he’s caring for on the screen have a darker ambition than simply to perform for his amusement – cue nightmarish exploration of AI and our complicity in its rise.The episode is interesting to me because … well, I was a socially awkward games journalist in the mid-1990s. But more importantly, so was Charlie Brooker. He began his writing career penning satirical features and blistering reviews for PC Zone magazine, one of the two permanently warring PC mags of the era (I shared an office with the other, PC Gamer). In Plaything, it’s PC Zone that Cameron Walker writes for, and there are several scenes taking place in its office, which in the programme is depicted as a reasonably grownup office space with tidy computer workstations and huge windows. I do not think the production design team got this vision from Brooker.“Zone had far less of the corporate workplace feel than the episode showed, and much more of a kids in the basement, youth club-cum-nightclub vibe to it,” says Paul Presley, who worked on PC Zone at the time. “It was a handful of messy, cluttered desks stuck in a windowless basement office round the back of Oxford Street (later Tottenham Court Road). We’d have killed for floor-to-ceiling windows! Editorial, art and production were all on top of each other, music blasting from the office stereo, usually furnished by the neighbouring Metal Hammer magazine. Desks were personal spaces, overflowing with paper, mags, trinkets, swag and tons and tons of CDs.”In the sake of journalistic thoroughness, I also contacted another PC Zone alumnus Richie Shoemaker for his recollections. “Although there were windows along one side, they were below street level and smeared with London grime,” he says. “The sills were piled high with dusty magazines, broken joysticks and likely-empty game boxes. It was perpetual night for the best part of eight years down there.”View image in fullscreenKids in the basement … the office of PC Zone magazine in the mid-1990sPhotograph: Richie ShoemakerThe episode was more accurate on the games themselves – the first scene in the office shows Cam playing Doom, when the editor comes over, shows him the front cover of the latest issue of the mag with System Shock on the cover, then asks Cameron if he’s finished his review of Bullfrog’s classic adventure game Magic Carpet. “[Plaything] is good on the timelines,” says Shoemaker. “Playing Doom in the office was of course standard – although when I joined the team Quake was the lunchtime and afterwork deathmatch of choice. The Magic Carpet reviewdidappear in the issue after System Shock (which was actually Charlie’s first cover review), but it got 96%, not 93% and was written by launch editor Paul Lakin – who went on to work at the Foreign Office.” He also reckons the episode’s grizzled old editor might have been inspired by then deputy editor, Chris Anderson, who according to Shoemaker was “quite a vampiric character who seemed to exist on a diet of cigarettes and Ultima Online.”Most fascinating to me though is the inspirational origin of the Thronglets virtual pet game. Most reviewers have been referencing Tamagotchi, the keychain pet toy that took the world by storm int the late 90s. Brooker himself has referenced it in an interview. However, a much more likely candidate was the 1996 title Creatures, in which players cared for generations of cuddly-looking critters. Although it looked like a cutesy pet game it was in fact a highly sophisticated artificial life experiment, created by the distinctly sci-fi-sounding CyberLife Technology. Players needed to try to establish breeding populations of the creatures – called norns – but your control over them was limited as they were coded with advanced neural networks and had functioning internal bodily systems regulating their behaviours and physical abilities. CyberLife made a big deal of the complexity and experimental nature of the game: the box came with a warning sticker stating “Digital DNA Enclosed” and the blurb on the back cautioned players that they would be unleashing the world’s first artificial life-science experiment – which is exactly what Plaything is about.View image in fullscreenLess cutesy than it looked … Creatures.Photograph: CyberLife TechnologiesCreatures creator Steve Grand bears similarities to the Plaything (and Bandersnatch) coder Colin Ritman. He was a programmer who got tired of conventional games and wanted to try something extremely new. He went on to write a book about Creatures and its development, Creation: Life and How to Make It, and later became an internationally renowned roboticist, famously developing a robot orangutan. Surely the most Black Mirror career trajectory ever. In 2011, he started work on a spiritual follow-up to Creatures named Grandroids, which like Thronglets was about developing a race of intelligent AI aliens – Grand launched a Kickstarter for it in 2016. The project has yet to surface although Grand has a new website for it under the namePhantasia. All very intriguing.This is one of the things I love aboutBlack Mirror, and indeed the use of technology and video games in conventional drama: this is an arcane world full of eccentric people no one outside the industry has heard of, yet the toys they make have massive ramifications. Personally, I wanted to see a lot more of the PC Zone as imagined by the programme, but I understand that the sinister Thronglets were the real focus. Maybe one day there will be a full Silicon Valley-style drama series about the games industry in the 1990s – it was a hell of a time. For now, it’s interesting to see the world both Brooker and I inhabited being used as the venue for dystopian fiction – even if they really did get it completely wrong about those windows.Explore more on these topicsGamesBlack MirrorTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is because it was exactly the thing you assumed it to be.On one hand, The Baldwins desperately wanted to be a show in the traditional TLC mould; a zany happy-go-lucky series about the chaos of raising an enormous family. But on the other, it was also about what happened on the set of Rust in 2021. And so every wack-a-doodle moment of family fun found itself being counterbalanced with the explicit acknowledgment thatAlec Baldwinfatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in an accident that caused untold pain to countless people and has cast a long dark shadow over Baldwin’s career.View image in fullscreenGrapes yes, cheese no … Baldwin and Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine.Photograph: REX/Everett CollectionFor example, Sunday night’s episode of The Baldwins (entitled You’re My 30 Rock) served as the season finale, and revolved in part around the state of Alec’s health. At one point Hilaria clambered on to her husband while he was stretching and half-jokingly told him: “You hold trauma in your shoulders,” and, well, that probably sounds about right, given everything.Baldwin went on to say that his health has suffered since the shooting, and as such his energy has been depleted. The emotional toll of the Rust fallout, combined with the fact that his wife is a health nut 26 years his junior, has made him more determined than ever to get into shape. Specifically, the shape he was when he made Blue Jasmine.Blue Jasmine came out 12 years ago, and Baldwin – mainly seen in flashbacks, as Cate Blanchett’s husband who was arrested for fraud and then killed himself in prison – did look remarkably slender in it. His secret? “I didn’t have no pasta, no potatoes, no candy, no sugar, and I lost probably 25lbs [10kg],” he said. “You see me in the movie and I look trim, comparatively speaking.”Which isn’t to say that Baldwin got in shape specifically for Blue Jasmine, because that would be crazy. Traditionally body transformation like this is reserved for the big roles. Tom Hanks slimmed down for Castaway because he was in every scene of an incredibly ambitious movie for which he found himself nominated for an Oscar. De Niro bulked up for Raging Bull because the audiences needed to see how far his character had fallen. Meanwhile, Alec Baldwin had a bit part in a Woody Allen film, which probably isn’t worth completely denying yourself all sugar and carbohydrates for an extended period of time.Rust: first trailer for Alec Baldwin western appears after on-set shootingRead moreIndeed, interviews from the time suggest that Baldwin slimmed down less because it was integral to his character and more because he was diagnosed aspre-diabetic, and his high-sugar diet left him “exhausted” and “swollen”. Nevertheless, he did seem incredibly proud of losing weight; during a2012 Letterman appearancehe literally dropped his trousers onstage to show how badly they fit him.Still, the transformation wasn’t an especially dramatic one, given the extremes he went to. He still looked exactly like Alec Baldwin, just an Alec Baldwin who was moderately thinner than the Alec Baldwin from 2010.Things have (very understandably) slipped a little in the last few years, but the main thing is that Alec Baldwin has a goal again. Nobody knows if he’ll ever return to acting and, while The Baldwins might have been made out of financial necessity, it would be a surprise if anyone – including him – is eager for more. If getting back into shape is the thing that will finally bring him some peace, then that’s what he should concentrate on. Only this time it’d be nice if he could drop his trousers behind closed doors, please.Explore more on these topicsAlec BaldwinReality TVcommentShareReuse this content"

The Scottish author was an outspoken socialist who could never understand why rightwing fans liked novels that were so obviously an attack on their worldview.But that hasn’t stopped Musk, whose Neuralink company – which develops implantable brain-to-computer interfaces – was directly inspired by Banks’s concept of “neural lace”. The barges used bySpaceXto land their booster rockets are all named after spaceships from the Culture books.Musk’s entire career stems from trying to replicate sci-fi novels. His desire to colonise Mars was sparked by the Foundation novels ofIsaac Asimov(another staunch leftwinger). Tesla’s Cybertruck is something that – in Musk’s words – “Bladerunner [sic] would have driven”. And it’s true that if you want to imagine you’re living in a bleak hellscape, a Cybertruck would work well. His AI tool Grok is named after the Martian word for “understand” in Robert Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land, and its tone is apparently based on The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. I’m sure Douglas Adams – who wrote with an anti-apartheid sticker on his typewriter – wouldn’t have been thrilled with the association, either.Musk isn’t alone in his enthusiasms.Mark Zuckerberghas renamed his company and sunk $100bn in pursuit of the “metaverse”, a word that first appeared in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 novel Snow Crash. So obsessed is Zuckerberg with the book – in which people plug into a simulated world to avoid a real one fallen into dystopian chaos – that at one point all product managers at Facebook were asked to read it as part of their training. Snow Crash also inspired the development of Google Earth, and was mandatory reading for the Xbox development team at Microsoft. Jeff Bezos loves Stephenson so much that he hired him to work for his Blue Origin rocket company.If sci-fi’s influence was simply on product design, it wouldn’t be a problem. If Zuckerberg wants to burn his own cash in pursuit of a personal fantasy, or Musk wants to build hideous cars, that’s their call. It may even inspire something genuinely useful from time to time.The great irony is that in their desperation to build escape routes, tech leaders risk creating the very dystopias they fearThe real issue is that sci-fi hasn’t just infused the tech moguls’ commercial ideas but also their warped understanding of society and politics. The dominant genre of sci-fi in the 80s and 90s, when today’s Silicon Valley overlords were growing up, was Cyberpunk – as exemplified in the novels of William Gibson (who invented the term “cyberspace”) and Stephenson, as well as any number of films and video games. The grandfather of the genre wasPhilip K Dick, whose novels and short stories spawned films including Blade Runner, Total Recall and Minority Report.Dick’s stories were fuelled by amphetamine-driven paranoia. Nothing can be trusted and nobody is who they appear to be. It’s a style that’s arguably had more impact on modern culture and aesthetics than any other. The Matrix (1999) is just one example of Dick’s wider influence: he had often spoken of other worlds and suggested our own reality was a simulation.As historian Richard Hofstadter noted in his famous 1964 essay, the “paranoid style” has been a feature of rightwing American politics for a long time – but The Matrix has given it a new vocabulary and imagery. The red pill Neo takes, choosing to escape his simulation and see reality, was repurposed by the far-right bloggerCurtis Yarvin, an associate of JD Vance, as the guiding metaphor for the “alt-right”. That the transgender Wachowski sisters, who directed the film, had in mind ametaphor for their own oppressionis bitterly ironic.This inversion of meaning, though, is common. We can see this most clearly in the way the dystopian settings of so much cyberpunk fiction are seen by today’s tech leaders as prophetic visions of a world they need to try to escape – whether by colonising Mars, building metaverses or, in the case of Vance’s billionaire patron Peter Thiel, backing efforts to create new city states by buying land in developing countries. In the original novels it tended to be people like them responsible for creating the dystopias in the first place, but they’ve somehow projected the blame on to the masses.In Snow Crash there’s something called “the Raft” – a collection of boats filled with infected, mind-controlled refugees headed for America’s west coast. It’s an image that recalls the viciously racist 1973 French sci-fi novel The Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail, in which a huge fleet of Indian refugees destroy western civilisation. It’s had a far-right fandom ever since and has been referenced by former Donald Trump campaign manager Steve Bannon. It’s a particular favourite of Stephen Miller, Trump’s lead policy adviser and close friend of Musk (Miller’s wife, Katie, is the Doge spokeswoman).It’s not much of a jump to see the actions of Thiel and Musk, and many of those around them, as an attempt to forestall this fate, linking, as they do, the racial obsessions of the far right with their odd brand of tech-utopianism. When Thiel writes that “I no longer believe freedom and democracy are compatible”, or when Musk makes up wild stories about the Democrats usingbenefit fraudto import migrants, they are unabashedly expressing this fear of being overrun. The greatest irony of all is that in their desperation to build escape routes, they risk creating the very dystopias they fear.Thiel often names companies he backs after Lord of the Rings artefacts. JD Vance, now America’s vice president and troll-in-chief, worked at two of them, Mithril Capital and Narya Capital (referencing a precious metal and a magical Ring of Fire, respectively). A third, Palantir, is a global data analytics and software company, a major supplier to the NHS and a defence contractor for numerous governments. It’s named after the powerful seeing stone used by both Saruman and Sauron in their attempts to control the world. Thiel is clearly a Lord of the Rings obsessive – the problem is, it’s not entirely clear which side he wanted to win.Sam Freedman writes on politics atsamf.substack.comExplore more on these topicsScience fiction booksThe big ideaThe metaverseFictionIain BanksPhilip K DickIsaac AsimovElon MuskfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In the bookstore around the corner from my school, there began to appear novels with black-and-white photographs on the dust jackets whose Spanish-language authors, while acknowledgingBorgesas thefonset origoof all literary endeavours, attempted to find in the 19th-century European realists new ways to depict the troubled reality of Spain and South America.One of those novels was La Ciudad y los Perros (The City and the Dogs, oddly translated into English as The Time of the Hero) by a young, unknown Peruvian writer,Mario Vargas Llosa, who, in 1962, had won the recently created Premio Biblioteca Breve in Spain. Our literature teacher, while encouraging us to explore the transgressive fields of surrealism and fantastic fiction, thought that this novel was too extreme for adolescent imaginations: too much youthful violence; too much murky sex; too much questioning of authority. There had been nothing like it in Spanish-language fiction before. A fierce indictment of Peru’s military system, incandescent with rage against the hypocrisy of the established order as mirrored in Lima’s most prestigious military academy (which the author had attended), it was also the chronicle of an adolescent rite of passage into the ranks of the commanding patriarchy. The book so incensed the Peruvian authorities that, in the tradition of the city’s founding fathers, anauto-da-féwas ordered and dozens of copies were burned in the academy’s courtyard. At the very start of what was labelled by canny publishers as the “boom” of Latin-American literature, Vargas Llosa’s book was recognised as a modern subversive classic.Until then, the so-called “novel of protest” in the literatures of Latin America had Zola as its model. Under the large shadow of the author of La Terre and Germinal, writers such as Ciro Alegría and José María Arguedas had written about the lives of those whom our European culture had taught us to deny. Vargas Llosa didn’t follow Zola but rather chose Flaubert as his guide, writing a decade later a splendid essay, The Perpetual Orgy, in which he argued that Madame Bovary kickstarted the modern novel by establishing an “objective” narrator who, because they refused to preach, gave the illusion of telling a story that was true.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Almost two decades later, Vargas Llosa became the head of the centre-right party Movimiento Libertad, and entered into a coalition with two other centre-right politicians. In 1990, as candidate to the presidency, Vargas Llosa lost to Alberto Fujimori, who was later sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights abuses, and later still, unlawfully pardoned. From then on, Vargas Llosa restricted his political activism to his frequent newspaper columns and, much more subtly and effectively, to his fiction, for which he was awarded, in 2010, the Nobel prize.Explore more on these topicsMario Vargas LlosafeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.While waiting for a show during London fashion week in February, I and a few fashion writers, stylists and editors were admiring each other’s outfits. Surprise, surprise, we discovered that the pieces we loved most were preowned (and largely from charity shops, I might add).The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It’s no secret that industry insiders love secondhand fashion: Kate Moss is known for her love of vintage; British Vogue recently hosted a vintage sale in collaboration with eBay; celebrities such as Zendaya, Kendall Jenner and Miley Cyrus are turning to archive looks for their red carpet appearances; even Selfridges now offersReselfridges, a range of preloved designer bags and accessories.I love buying secondhand. I am nearly always wearing something vintage, whether it’s the Levi’s 501s I discovered in a thrift store or one of the many classic Ralph Lauren Oxford shirts I’ve bought from every resale marketplace going. I love the thrill of stumbling on something you can’t get anywhere else. My fashion week piece of note, for instance, was an unusual silk tie that I found in a Shelter charity shop in west London. And I once bought a vintage Christian Dior shirt for just £60. Writing abouthow to shop online for secondhand clothesfor the Filter, therefore, was pretty much my dream commission.Yet fashion insiders aren’t the only ones wise to the perks. The global secondhand clothing market is expected to grow almost three times as fast as the overall global clothing market by 2029, according to areport by ThredUp. Besides the obvious benefits of more affordable prices and one-of-a-kind pieces, this rapid rise is also down to an increasing concern for the planet, and recognition that fast fashion is contributing to themountains of waste.By saving old clothes from landfill, shopping secondhand extends the life cycle of each garment and reduces its overall environmental impact. That means using fewer resources, and less energy and water –Oxfam reported last yearthat buying one pair of jeans and a T-shirt secondhand can save the equivalent of 20,000 standard bottles of water compared with buying them new. With the fast-fashion market at an all-time high, buying preloved could be the sustainable antidote the world needs.How to shop secondhandView image in fullscreenThere’s a knack to finding secondhand gems.Photograph: Nick David/Getty ImagesWhere do you start? My first choice is Vinted, but I also regularly browse eBay and Depop, as well as thrift stores and, most of all, charity shops. I keep tabs on the brands I like, saving searches with alerts on my favourite luxury labels, such as Wales Bonner and Bode, as well as preppy names like Gant and Aimé Leon Dore for the classics. I always use filters to limit the results to listings that are the right size and fabric – there’s nothing more frustrating than finding the perfect piece that’s slightly the wrong fit.I delve into all this and more in myguide to vintage shopping, covering everything from how to use the “trending” sections of platforms to how to stop impulse buying: even when you’re shopping secondhand, the “buy less, buy better” mantra rings true.

The Google project became known as Waymo in 2016.Any idea how many more years until we see the first self-driving taxis?They already have them in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix, among other places.You mean they’re testing the technology on actual roads?No, I mean you can get a Waymo to take you somewhere in San Francisco right now …It’s a miracle!… and also possibly offer you a job while you’re in there.Now that’s service.How does the technology behind the recruitment end of this whole thing work?It’s surprisingly lo-fi: someone riding in a Waymo left a handwritten note advertising some senior software engineer positions “to work on AI/music project”, along with the company website and an email address for applicants.Presuming that anyone getting into a driverless taxi would be precisely the kind of devil-may-care nerd they were looking for?Exactly.Did it work?The person who left the note, the Influur CEO Alessandra Angelini, says she received about 60 CVs as a result.I’m amazed 60 qualified applicants got into the same Waymo that day.That’s statistically unlikely, but someone who did hire the taxi took a pic of the note and posted it on social media, where it was viewed 300,000 times.So that’s how it works.Job offers aren’t the only advantage of driverless technology. Another rider left a note in a Waymo looking for a date, listing his age (26), his height (“5ft 10in on a good day”), other particulars (“runs marathons”) and a phone number.Didthatwork?He got 200 replies, but again, only because someone else posted a pic on social media.It seems this new recruitment system relies rather heavily on third parties withX accounts.Also, the taxis get cleaned pretty regularly, so your ad won’t last long.Will the novelty of this approach wear off once driverless taxis become commonplace?Probably. I mean, you wouldn’t respond to an ad for a date that somebody left in an Uber.Do say:“Enjoy the ride, and thank you for your application!”Don’t say:“Drivers wanted.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesMotoringGooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it took one more blow to bring him to tearsPaula CocozzaMon 14 Apr 2025 01.55 EDTShareDavid Williamswas 17 when his mother died of cancer. But he didn’t cry when his mum’s friend knocked on the door in the dead of night to give him and his sisters the news. He was the eldest of three, “the adult male” as his father had left years earlier.Instead, he bottled up his feelings and carried on working. Williams, now 61, says: “Something happens to you in that situation that isn’t your choice.” This was 1980, and the family lived on the Lache social housing estate in Chester, which was, he says, “a tough place. Lads didn’t go around crying.”The biggest imperatives were practical. “We were skint. I had to go to work.” His job in the parts department of a car dealership brought in the family’s only income.Williams’s memory of his final meeting with his mother, and of what she said and didn’t say, laid the foundation for his emotional lockdown. “She was as poorly as you could look. I gave her a kiss on the forehead, told her I loved her, and she waved me out of the room. She couldn’t talk.”Over the years that followed, Williams was transferred to London, switched jobs again and again. He met his future wife at a nightclub. They “had a dance, got on”. Later, they had a son. A sports shop asked him to manage a branch in Essex, and helped him to buy a house by contributing to the deposit. In all that time, Williams never shed a tear. “Never cried my entire adult life,” he says. “I couldn’t afford to break.”In his 30s, he studied marketing, and in his 40s he completed an MA in executive coaching, partly to understand his own motivation to succeed. “What my mum had taught me was that things can be taken from you very quickly. I was very driven … until the 2008 crash.”His home in Essex had subsidence, with a crack in the wall big enough to see the neighbours through; when the insurers stopped paying out, Williams had to work overseas to make ends meet, selling financial services to expats.In 2014, after 30 years together, he and his wife divorced. “I lost the love of my life,” he says. But still he didn’t cry.Nor did he cry five years later, when at 55 he was diagnosed with a brain tumour. It was, he says, “time to fight. I’m used to that.”People are scared of breakdowns. But a breakdown is the old you dying. Your brain is resetting, taking care of youBut the tumour made work impossible. Radiotherapy triggered seizures that required hospitalisation. Williams felt very alone. Then came Covid and lockdown. “For the first time in my life, I had time to reflect,” he says.But it proved too much for him, and “this period of introspection” triggered a breakdown at the age of59.“People are scared of breakdowns,” he says. But “a breakdown is the old you dying. Your brain is resetting itself. It’s taking care of you.”When his sisters visited him in hospital, he says: “I sobbed my heart out.” For the first time, they talked deeply about their mum. “I think they always saw me as distant. I’d moved away, didn’t really engage.” As the tears poured down, he felt relief. Something was beginning to come out.Williams is recovering from his breakdown, and continues to live with his tumour . He has written about his experience to aid his healing, and has found Christianity, along with a community at church. Last year, aged 60, understanding that he needed to grieve, he joined a support group. “The time was finally right.”“Who can say that a brain tumour has been good for them? But if I hadn’t had the tumour, I’d have carried on working and I wouldn’t have had the breakdown,” Williams says. “Even though I’ve got the tumour, I’m finally learning to be ‘emotionally normal’.”These days, Williams cries “now and again” about his mum, or his marriage, or life in general, “trying to make sense of what’s happened, this monumental change, and how to start again”.Learning to grieve means appreciating “the privilege of being here, of being loved, of having a beautiful son”. He knows that life changes quickly. “And that means someone might fall in love with me again, and I can choose what to focus on. I’ve still got loads to contribute.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsLife and styleA new start after 60BereavementDeath and dyingMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here they are again with solutions.1. Well balancedWhat number equals the average of its digits?Solution4.5If you allow trailing zeros, there are three solutions with four digits and one with five.1.5002.2503.7501.80002. The painted cubeA large wooden cube is painted on all of its faces. I divide the cube into a thousand mini cubes by slicing it nine times in each dimension.How many cubes have no paint on them?The bad way to calculate the answer is to start with 1000 cubes and subtract the ones with paint: 100 x 2 from the first set of opposing faces, 80 x 2 from what’s left of the next two opposing faces and 64 x 2 from what’s left of the remaining two faces.The puzzle is to find a much faster way to get a solution. It involves a simpler calculation that you are more likely to be able to do in your head.Solution83= (23)3= 29= 512All the outside mini cubes have paint. If you remove them all you will be left with an 8 x 8 x 8 cube. You could try multiplying 8 x 64, but easier would be to double nine times to get the answer3. Clever countdownYou are playing a game with a friend, in which you start at the number 100 and take turns to deduct a number between 1 and 7. The winner is the person that lands on zero.Which number do you choose first to be assured of winning?Solution:96The winner is the person who lands on 8. (If you are on 8, your opponent cannot land on 0.

And ready in about half an hour, tooRukmini IyerMon 14 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareThis is one of my favourite recipes for this column so far. Light, fresh goat’s cheese and artichokes baked in a tart with a smooth, herb-packed base and finished with hazelnuts; I especially like the contrast of the crisp filo against the filling. There are a lot of herbs here, but they balance beautifully, so I’d advise using them all, particularly the chives. (I bought 30g packs of mint and basil, but by the time I had got rid of the stems, there were just 20g leaves left. My herb windowsill is lavish with rosemary, sage and oregano, but sadly not the soft herbs yet.)Goat’s cheese, herb and hazelnut spring tartYou want a soft, rindless goat’s cheese for this.Prep20 minCook25 minServes430g flat-leaf parsley, leaves and stems20g mint, leaves only20g basil, leaves only15g chives100g shelled hazelnuts,half very roughly chopped, the rest left whole1tsp sea salt flakes3mediumeggs4sheets filo pastry280g jar artichokes in oil, drained and oil reserved125g log rindless soft goat’s cheeseHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the parsley, mint, basil, most of the chives (reserve a few to finish), the whole hazelnuts, salt and eggs into a high-speed blender, then blitz for a minute, until very smooth and the consistency of double cream.Line a 24-25cm round pie dish with crumpled baking paper (crumpling will mean you can push it into the round edges of the dish). Lay a sheet of the filo over the paper, brush generously with some of the reserved artichoke oil, then lay a second sheet of filo on top at a 90-degree angle. Brush this with oil, then repeat with the remaining two sheets of filo. Once all the filo is in the dish, crumple up the edges a little to create a lip.Pour the green mixture into the pastry, scraping out any last bits from the blender, then arrange the drained artichokes on top. Top them with teaspoonfuls of goat’s cheese (it’s too soft to crumble, so I break off teaspoon-sized bits). Scatter over the chopped hazelnuts, then bake for 25 minutes.Remove from the oven, and leave the tart to settle and cool for 10 minutes. Finely chop the reserved chives, scatter over the top of the tart and serve warm.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyCheeseSpring food and drinkPastryBakingMain courseEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

I own 45% of my home and pay rent on the remaining 55% toMetropolitan Thames ValleyHousing(MTVH). The building has a valid fire risk certificate signed byAdam Kiziakof Tri Fire, but because he was latersuspended pending investigation, lenders of prospective buyers view my flat as risky. MTVH is unable to give a timeline of when this will all be sorted out, yet is happy to raise rentswhile I am stuck. Moreover,it waited three months to inform us, during which time my flat was pointlessly on sale. This is my first home, but it’s beginning to seem like a prison.ZV, StevenageProblems surrounding fire safety certificates have trapped ­hundreds of people in unsaleable flats, but yours is a particularly ­unpleasant situation. It was the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire that prompted the requirement for all ­residential blocks over 18 metres to be surveyed for, among other things, flammable cladding. Risky construction materials and a shortage of fire safety engineers have prevented many buildings from being issued with crucial certificates known as EWS1s. Without these, lenders won’t lend.An unknown number of ­residents are now paying the price of alleged malpractice by Adam Kiziak, whose firm, Tri Fire, has signed off hundreds of buildings since 2020. He was suspended from the Institution of Fire Engineers last November after ­allegations of unethical conduct and incompetence. The allegations were upheld after an investigation, and he has since been expelled after allegedly forging signatures on EWS1s ­during the suspension. He denies all ­wrongdoing. Your EWS1 was issued in 2020, but some lenders have since withdrawn mortgage offers on properties surveyed by Tri Fire.MTVH confirmed it knew of the problem three months before residents were informed and said it had immediately asked your freeholder, Land Charter Homes, to commission a new fire safety assessment. This was agreed and announced shortly after you wrote to me. Land Charter Homes directed me to its managing agent, Six Hills Management Ltd, which said it had spent the intervening months seeking confirmation your building’s EWS1 was legitimate before informing residents of the situation. Because of residents in your predicament, it undertook a new survey last month. This has just been completed and the final report is due imminently. In the meantime you have lost a buyer. Hopefully, armed with the new paperwork, you can start to move on by summer.Explore more on these topicsPropertyYour problems, with Anna TimsHousingShared ownershipConsumer affairsMortgagesEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s a long list of charcuterie and cheeses, as well as favourites such as the thick and hearty steak and mustard sandwich (€15,75) and a more elaborate broad-bean salad with chorizo (€10,50). New on the menu is the meagre (a large white fish) with pesto, cauliflower and green beans (€20,50).

Nowadays, supported by her children, Isabel, who is originally from Angola, welcomes locals and tourists with delicious dishes, includingmoamba(an Angolan chicken stew with okra),moqueca de camarão(Brazilian prawn stew with coconut milk and palm oil) andalcatra(a beef dish from the Azores). Mains cost around €15.ClosedSun,onFacebookZuariView image in fullscreenZuari, which opened 45 years ago, is one of Lisbon’s oldest Goan restaurants. It’s a small family business, still headed by its founder, Orlando Rodrigues. His wife, Sheila, works her magic in the kitchen to create incredible crispy samosas, while daughter Débora’s traditionalbebinca– a multilayered cake – takes a full day to make. The small dining room in Lapa smells irresistibly of spices and a tapestry depicting a beach in Goa, a Portuguese colony until 1961, hangs on the wall. Don’t miss the prawn curry (€14) or the prawnbalchão(a spicy, sour tomato-chilli sauce, €15) and leave room for the ice-cream – cinnamon and ginger or mango – made by Débora.Open Tues-Sat, Sunlunch only, closedMon, onFacebookCanalhaA year and a half after it opened, Canalha is still the talk of the town. Located in the west of the city, close to Belém, chef João Rodrigues, known for the Michelin-starredFeitoria, is at the helm. He is passionate about sourcing the very best produce (hisProjecto Matériawebsite maps producers he rates from all over Portugal) and in Canalha he has created a casual dining place with exceptional cuisine, seen in both rustic daily lunchtime specials and more elaborate dishes. With Lívia Orofino as the resident chef, Canalha has just landed a Bib Gourmand award. The fresh grilled squid with sheep butter (€25) and the open shrimp egg tortilla (€18) are pure joys. Sit at the counter to be close to the action – it’s like being at a chef’s table.Opendaily,paradigma.ptPigmeuView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joana FreitasA neighbourhood restaurant in Campo de Ourique, in the west of Lisbon, Pigmeu has a nose-to-tail approach and keeps things simple, offering high quality Alentejo pork, delicious vegetables and natural wines in a relaxed atmosphere. Chef and entrepreneur Miguel Azevedo Peres sources organic meat and vegetables directly from local farmers to promote responsible food consumption. Recently he introduced a good value set lunch menu, with a snack, starter and main for €17. The lunch menu changes every week, but you can always rely on thecroquetes, pork sandwich (€10) andtorresmo do rissol(crispy pork crackling). Pigmeu holds a Michelin Bib Gourmand.ClosedSun,pigmeu.ptMãe – Cozinha com AmorView image in fullscreenThe name translates as “Mother – Cooking with Love” and the walls of this spacious restaurant in Estefânia are covered with photos of the mothers of staff and clients. Chef João Diogo Mendes creates comfort food with a twist, many dishes are based on his mum’s recipes, and those of his business partner Raimundo Ferreira. The fish and prawn rice and duck rice (€18) are a contemporary take on a Portuguese staple (we’re the biggest consumers of rice per capita in Europe). Their mothers would be impressed.Open daily, Sunlunch only,onInstagramPradoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joana FreitasChef António Galapito has been at Prado for seven years but is still creating some of the most exciting dishes in the city with local, seasonal produce (most of it organic). His clever cuisine celebrates the best of Portugal with influences from farther afield (Galapito previously worked in London with Nuno Mendes). The modern plant-filled space in Baixa is flooded with fabulous natural light and serves natural and organic wines. On a recent visit, I loved the sweet potato snack with mussels and curry, as well as the marinated mackerel with green apple and olive (€16). The whole Prado team, led by Inês Pereira, is charming and welcoming.Thurs-Satlunch, Tues-Satdinner,pradorestaurante.comGarum Fish & Wine BarView image in fullscreenFish and shellfish become extra special in the hands of chefs Filipe Rodrigues and Hugo Gouveia.

Expect fun and bold flavours, with a focus on the Roman condimentgarum, a fermented fish sauce (made from umami-rich brined sardines – plus a lot of experimenting over the years). Rodrigues is now having fun dry-ageing fish such as tuna and seabass from the Azores islands for about 20 days. The seabass rice (€16) is the bestseller, and don’t miss the dessert of carob petit gateau, fig ice-cream and reduction of Carcavelos wine.ClosedSunand Mon, onInstagramPetisco SaloioPetisco Saloio in Campo Pequeno is one of the moderntascas(small, local restaurants serving traditional, simple fare with a focus on quick lunches) emerging across the city. Its two young chefs, Diogo Meneses and Carlos Pinheiro, previously had careers in fine dining but realised that family-style cooking was what made them happy. It’s a favourite place for dishes such as the ubiquitousbitoque(steak with sauce, chips and rice, topped with a fried egg) at lunchtime. The two daily specials (fish or meat) cost €13 (go after 2pm when office workers are back at their desks). At dinner, the menu is broader, withpetiscos(small sharing plates) ranging from pork cheek sandwich (€8) to octopus stew with beans and sausage (€14).Closed Sat lunch and Sun, onInstagramExplore more on these topicsLisbon holidaysRestaurantsFood and drinkCity breaksPortugal holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But instead of “facilitating” his return as ordered by the supreme court, the administration has trapped Abrego García in a catch-22 by offshoring his fate to a jurisdiction beyond the reach of legality – or, it would seem, basic logic or common decency.The paradox is this: the Trump administration says it cannot facilitate the return of Abrego García because he is in a prison in El Salvador. El Salvador says it cannot return him because that would betantamount to “smuggling” him into the US.The absurdity of the position played out on Monday during an Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Bukele where the two men appeared to enjoy mocking the powerlessness of the US courts to intervene in the fate of anyone caught in the maws of the Trump administration’s deportation machine.“How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I’m not going to do it,” Bukele said when asked about whether he would help to return Abrego García.There is no evidence that Abrego García is a terrorist or a member of the gang MS-13 as the Trump administration has claimed. But that is not really important here.“I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” Bukele said during a meeting with the US president on Monday. “They’d love to have a criminal released into our country,” Trump added.Trump’s lieutenants also jumped in on Monday, arguing that they could not intervene in the case because Bukele is a foreign citizen and outside of their control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Increasingly, the administration is including questions of immigration in that foreign policy in order to defy the courts.Monday’s presentation was in effect a pantomime. Both sides could quickly intervene if they wanted to. But this was a means to an end. Miller said this case would not end with Abrego García living in the US.More broadly, it indicates the Trump administration’s modus operandi: to move quickly before the courts can react to its transgressions and, when they do, to deflect and defy until the damage done cannot be reversed.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorMarylandUS politicsAmericasMarco RubioanalysisShareReuse this content"

The second was a schedule that detailed every task for every minute of her day. Then, when she was 16, she was given a cilice – a spiked metal chain to wear around her thigh – and a whip.In the late 1980s, Opus Dei, a secretive and ultra-conservative Catholic organisation, promised Martínez an escape from a life of poverty in ruralArgentina. By attending one of their schools, they said, she would receive an education and opportunities.“They told me I would study and progress. I thought with an education that later I would be able to help my family,” says Martínez, 50.“But I became like a slave. They treated me like a slave, without any capacity to think or act or do.”Q&AWhat is Opus Dei?ShowOpus Dei (Latin for \"Work of God\") is an influential organisation within the Catholic church, made up of several thousand priests and about90,000 lay members in 90 countries, roughly a third of whom are celibate.It was founded in 1928 by the Spanish priest Josemaría Escrivá, who believed that everyday life, as well as rituals such as prayer, could be sanctifying. Many members of Opus Dei hold powerful positions in the Vatican and it enjoyed the strong support of the controversialwartime pope Pius XIIand Pope John Paul II, whomade Escrivá a saintin 2002.Escrivá’sconnections to Gen Francisco Franco’s fascist regimein Spain; Opus Dei’slinks with Latin American military dictatorships, such as that of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet; its theologically conservative stance against the Catholic church’s doctrinal modernisation during the 1960s; and its influence in business and education have made it a controversial institution. As the church's only “personal prelature”, Opus Dei has a certain autonomy within the Catholic hierarchy and is seen by many as a “church within a church”.It has also been criticised for its allegedly secretive nature, aggressiverecruitment methods, repressive approach to sexuality (including encouraging self-mortification with theciliceand whips), andban on many books. It strongly opposes a range of reproductive health services, includingcontraceptionandabortion.Oren GruenbaumPhotograph: Eric Vandeville/Gamma-RaphoWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Martínez, along with dozens of other women in Argentina, has accused Opus Dei – which has apresence in more than 70 countriesbut is strongest in Spain, Italy and Latin America – of coercing them as children and adolescents into a life of domestic servitude.View image in fullscreenAndrea Martínez says she was put to work at once by Opus Dei: ‘My mother left and I was given my schedule. We worked nine hours a day, seven days a week.’Photograph: Harriet BarberThey say they were forced into working up to 12-hour days, cooking and cleaning for the elite members, without pay.The women also say they faced extreme control, their letters were censored, and they were banned from reading anything but children’s books or religious texts. When they eventually escaped, the women say they were left without money, clothes or qualifications.They said there was no other option for me – I was too poor, I had no man to marry; if I didn’t join, my family would be condemned to hellAndrea MartínezAfter a two-year investigation, Argentinian federal prosecutors have taken on their case, accusing senior leaders of Opus Dei in South America of overseeing the exploitation and trafficking of girls, adolescents and women between 1972 and 2015. The prosecutors’ report is now before a judge, who will decide whether to proceed to trial.Opus Dei has categorically denied the accusations and says they have been taken “completely out of context”.The prosecutors have alleged that Opus Dei (“Work of God” in Latin) established a structure dedicated to recruiting girls from poor rural families, which they said took “advantage of their extreme vulnerability”.View image in fullscreenA portrait of Escrivá at St Eugene, Rome, a church built by the controversial wartime pope, Pius XII, and Opus Dei’s main church. Escrivá was canonised in 2002.Photograph: Gamma-Rapho/GettyIn 1979, members of Opus Dei visited Claudia Carrero’s family and gave the then 13-year-old a prayer card of Josemaría Escrivá, the organisation’s founder, who was canonised in 2002. “We led a quiet, religious life,” she says. “My father was a labourer and my mother a housewife.They tried to keep them like little children. They justify all of this by saying that it is ‘a decision from God’Sebastián Sal“Opus Dei said that if I came to the school, I would learn about hotel management and that I would get to travel. I was excited, but they did not take me there to study,” she says, “but to work.”The school Martínez was sent to was several hours from her parents’ house. She remembers being put to work the day she arrived, along with dozens of other children. “My mother left and I was given my schedule.“We worked nine hours a day, seven days a week, washing the clothes and preparing the food of senior male members. We only had three hours of school a day.”The organisation succeeded, the women say, because the girls were kept isolated and docile, allowed only one phone call and letter home a month.View image in fullscreenAndrea Martinez, front left, at Opus Dei. ‘The only texts we were allowed to read were children’s books or religious studies.’Photograph: Andrea Martinez“From the very beginning, I was told that I couldn’t say anything about Opus Dei, or what was happening, to my parents. We were told, always, to be obedient and docile,” she says.“They would only send my letters if they thought what I had written was acceptable. I was cut off from the outside world,” she adds.Sebastián Sal, the women’s lawyer, alleges that the “vocational schools” were a “seedbed” for Opus Dei. “They tried to keep them like little children,” Sal says. “They justify all of this by saying that it is ‘a decision from God’.”After four years at the “school”, Martínez says she was forced to become anumerary assistant– essentially, Opus Dei’s domestic servants, who had to devote themselves to cooking and cleaning for the senior members and priests, while living a life of celibacy.Despite wanting to study psychology, she says she was told that: “There was no other option for me, that I was too poor, that I had no man to marry; that if I didn’t join, my family would be condemned to hell.”Afterwards, Martínez says her work increased to upwards of 12 hours a day, and she was given a cilice to wear around her upper thigh for two hours a day as a penance, and a small whip made of rope with which to flagellate herself while praying.“The only texts we were allowed to read were children’s books or religious studies. There was no more school. I was trapped,” she says.At 17, Carrero says, they also put pressure on her to become a numerary assistant: “They said that I had nobody to marry, that this was my destiny.”View image in fullscreenLucía Giménez, left, Alicia Torancio and Beatriz Delgado, who are among 43 former Opus Dei domestic workers whose case was taken up by prosecutors.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/APEvery detail of her life was controlled, she says, from her clothes to visiting her parents. “I was not allowed to spend Christmas with my family or attend my grandmother’s funeral. Often, they denied our requests, telling us to ‘offer it up’ as a sacrifice to God. They hid behind God to use us.”Carrero, like the other women, says she was regularly moved between residences, which she believes was to prevent them forming strong friendships. “I was moved many times from cities to cities, countries to countries – Paraguay, Uruguay – with no choice,” she says.View image in fullscreenClaudia Carrero when she lived at Opus Dei. She says meeting the other women brought her peace.Photograph: Claudia CarreroMartínez says she spent 10 years with Opus Dei before escaping. When she left, she had only 10 pesos (equivalent to a few dollars), no normal clothes and discovered that the educational certificates she had been issued by Opus Dei were not recognised.“I had never received a salary. I didn’t know how to use money, how to speak to people. I was 23 but acted like a child of 12,” she says.Argentinian prosecutors have alleged that at least 43 women, “most of them girls and adolescents”, were “subjected to living conditions comparable to servitude” and “trapped in a cycle of exploitation and abuse”.There was “a complete lack of fair pay and basic rights, all under the pretext of ‘dedication’ and ‘spiritual salvation’,” say the prosecutors, who have requested that four former heads of Opus Dei in Argentina be summoned for questioning.In astatement on its website, Opus Dei has said the schools were approved by the Argentinian authorities and that allegations that the girls were coerced into joining the organisation on promises of education are “false and misleading”.It said the “spiritual vocation” of numerary assistant was “freely chosen”, that there was “no barrier to leaving” and that “numerary auxiliaries” must reaffirm their desire to be a member multiple times over several years. It also claims that the women received remuneration for their work.Adopted by their parents’ enemies: tracing the stolen children of Argentina’s ‘dirty war’Read moreThe women have criticised the Catholic organisation’s response. They are demanding financial compensation, an acknowledgment of their suffering and a formal apology. “We want Opus Dei to accept what they have done and recognise its impact,” says Martínez.Today, Martínez is studying psychology, while Delgado has recently completed secondary school, “only 40 years late,” she says.Carrero has married and has a teenage daughter. She says meeting the other 42 women has brought her peace. “At last,” she says, “I am free.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentRights and freedomArgentinaAmericasHuman rights (Global development)CatholicismReligionChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It testednew landing bargeson ships that could facilitate an amphibious assault on Taiwan. And it unveiled deep-sea cable cutters with the ability to switch off another country’s internet access – a tool no other nation admits to having.China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific to send a message of supremacy to its regional neighbours, experts say. But it’s also testing the thinking of a bigger rival further afield:Donald Trump.Since Trump took office in January, he and his cabinet members have focused their China strategy on tariffs and havelaunched an escalating trade war with Beijing. They had been largely silent on China’s growing acts of aggression in the Indo-Pacific’s seas.‘America is going down’: China can capitalise on damage caused by Trump, former PLA colonel saysRead moreThat’s starting to change.On April 1, theUS state department condemned Beijing’s“aggressive military activities and rhetoric” in relation to unannounced military drills in the Taiwan Strait, which have become bigger in scale in recent months and are increasingly resembling actual invasion. That came on the heels of a visit to the region byUS defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he assured Japan and the Philippines that America would continue to defend them against China. He clarified the US had not changed its status quo stance on Taiwan, and the Pentagon reiterated China remained theUS’ biggest threat.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with secretary of state Marco Rubio, left, and defence secretary Pete Hegseth, right.Photograph: Molly Roberts/White House/Planet Pix/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockBut the US’s Indo-Pacific allies will want to hear those assurances from Trump, who has not shown his cards on issues like Taiwan. When asked by a journalist in February for his stance,Trump refused to be drawnand has said nothing on Taiwan since. He’s not afraid to diverge from his senior advisers, and hishaphazard approach to Ukraine ceasefire talks– and tariffs – gives little confidence the president has a consistent, long-term strategy on any given global affair.“The Chinese are watching what’s happening with the Trump administration and seeing how far they can push things,” said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.And in their testing of Trump, the seas around China are likely to become more restive, Davis said, adding that China will keep ratcheting up its drills in theTaiwanStrait and target countries with which it has territorial disputes, including the Philippines and Japan.“China will be more willing to impose the risk of casualties on the Philippines through ramming ships and so forth. It might go fromusing water cannonto something a bit more aggressive,” Davis said. “The goal is to intimidate Manila into accepting China’s interests.”How heavily involved the US military should get in the Indo-Pacific and how far the US should go to protect Taiwan fromChinaare issues that have divided Trump’s most senior officials, according to a former state department staffer who worked in Trump’s initial weeks in office.“There are definitely different competing camps that you could liken to a royal court, all competing for the last word and influence with Trump,” the former staffer said. “There is definitely a split over Taiwan policy between traditional NatSec folks like (Marco) Rubio and (Mike) Waltz versus Maga folks.”But which side Trump is on isn’t clear.Sam Roggeveen, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, said it was known that a faction of the Trump administration wanted to turn away from Europe. “But it’s not at all clear that he agrees with the second part of it – doing more in Asia,” he said.What is clear from Trump’s posture in Ukraine talks is that he is open to putting deals on trade and major geopolitical issues on the same table. He also has a tendency to change his stance on a subject in a matter of days.Donald Trump says he is ‘very angry’ with Vladimir Putin over UkraineRead moreBeijing will be watching to see how Trump sways. If Russia’s Vladimir Putin can strike a grand bargain with Trump by using economic incentives in exchange for Ukrainian land, Beijing may look to do the same with Taiwan.And that’s causing anxiety among the US’s closest allies in the Indo-Pacific, said Jenny Schuch-Page, managing principal in energy and sustainability with the Washington-based Asia Group. “Even the prospect for a ‘grand bargain’ with China will make countries in South-east Asia wary about how they will fare,” she said.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, did not comment on whether Beijing was looking for such a deal, but he said China “deplores” the US’ criticisms of its drills near Taiwan, calling them “a mischaracterisation of the facts and truth and an interference in China’s internal affairs.”What Trump is likely to focus on is staying competitive with China, which is ahead in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles and 6G internet.The lack of a long-term China strategy is problematic, according to Danny Russel, a former US diplomat and vice-president of international security and diplomacy with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington.He points to mass firings in the country’s intelligence services, which included laying off dedicated China researchers from the CIA, as a dangerous move in terms of security and the US’s bargaining position in trade talks.China will probably try to recruit those laid off for its own intelligence gathering on the US, he said. AReuters reportsuggests it already is.“We’re blinding ourselves at a moment when the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies call for clarity,” Russel said.How China is using salami slicing tactics against Taiwan – videoThedefunding of Radio Free Asia– a sister organisation of Voice of America – is another own-goal, Russel said, cutting off a valuable source of information from China and other countries that are difficult to report from, like North Korea.“It’s a kind of unilateral disarmament in the information space at a time when China, Russia, and North Korea are ramping up,” Russel said of the cuts. “Why are we voluntarily giving up our best tools of competition? There’s a big difference between belt-tightening and self-sabotage.”That may become a security concern for countries like Australia, which has a long tradition of sharing intelligence back and forth with the US. China is likely to ramp up its missions in international waters near Australia, Davis and Roggenveen said, so a reliable flow of information on China is crucial.A Chinese research vessel making a loop around Australia is a case in point. The Tan Suo Yi Hao has been cruising international waters off Australia’s southern and western coasts for two weeks surveying subsea communication cables – critical infrastructure thatallows Australians to send everything from emails to military secrets.“I’d prefer it wasn’t there,” is about as much as Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese could say when asked by journalists for his thoughts.Without a strong signal on the region from Trump, there could be more Chinese ships to come.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificTaiwanDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

A land defender who had spent more than 20 years working for the local environment, Silva was preparing to leave on a motorcycle trip to photograph illegal logging near Las Botijas, in Comayagua, centralHonduras, to support a complaint to the prosecutor’s office.As he was about to set off, Ana suggested he take their son, Juan Antonio Hernández, 20, with him, as his new mobile phone took better photos.The men said they would probably be home by 8pm. At midnight, their worried family called the authorities, sparking a search.The next day, father and son were found dead and dismembered below a cliff close to Las Botijas.One of Silva’s sons discovered the body parts. The men’s bodies had been dismembered with chainsaws and their remains left at the foot of the cliff. Silva’s torso and arms have not been found, while Antonio’s head remains missing.The murders are a fresh reminder of the severe violence faced by nature defenders inHonduras, which in 2023 became the country with the highest number of defenders killed per capita in the world.View image in fullscreenJuan Silva’s son, Selvin David Ventura Hernández, stands on the cliff from which his father and brother’s bodies were thrown.Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The GuardianSelvin David Ventura Hernández, one of Juan’s sons, believes that the phone call, from an unknown number, is the starting point for explaining the harrowing deaths. The family believes the person making the call was impersonating the authorities. “My father didn’t think anything of it,” says Ventura. “In the moment, none of us did.”Now, the family says, they are living in fear. They rarely go outside and are considering moving house. “By killing my father, they expected to terminate the activities against logging in the region. And they were successful; none of us will follow in his footsteps,” Ventura says. “But what they did not expect is that we are demanding justice. They are now waiting for this to blow over and for our justice system to fail us. But we are fighting.”Silva’s relatives say he had previously been attacked with a machete, in March 2020, which resulted in a severe injury to his right arm and six days in hospital. They also claim he had repeatedly approached the prosecutor’s office to complain about illegal logging activities, but action was rarely taken.View image in fullscreenAna Luiza Hernández Raudalez shows photos of her husband (middle) and her son Antonio (upper right).Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The GuardianAfter the murders, the Honduraninstitute for forest conservation(ICF) issued a statementcondemning the “violent acts”, describing the two men’s deaths as “tragic” and asking for investigation and protection of “those who report environmental crimes in defence of the environment”.In 2023, the NGO Global Witnessreported a total of 196murders and enforced disappearances of land defenders across the world. Honduras, tied with Mexico, had the third-highest number of violent land defender deaths (18), behind Brazil (25) and Colombia (79) – which makes Honduras the most dangerous country in relative to population numbers.Research also shows thatat least 131land and environmental defenders were murdered in Honduras between 2012 and 2022, with 70 of these deaths occurring since 2016.Laura Furones, a senior adviser at Global Witness, says Honduras emerges “pretty regularly” as a “worrying country” for land defenders’ rights. Among the factors behind the high rate of violence against land defenders, she explains, is the presence of natural resources, which may be exploited for agricultural purposes or corporate interests.View image in fullscreenJosue holds the wood shavings left behind after illegal logging in La Protección, Comayagua, Honduras in March 2025.Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The GuardianFurones also says Honduras is home to a “fairly vocal civil society”, including Indigenous activist groups. In a number of cases, she says, “trying to take a stand and trying to protect those lands and resources” can result in violence.Activists who are perceived to “get in the way of these interests” may risk being attacked as well, she says.The less impunity there is, the less normalisation. The more prosecution there is, the more awarenessFrank Cruz, Conadeh coordinatorGlobal Witness figures align with those compiled by local authorities. At the end of February,Honduras’ human rights commission(Conadeh)revealed that 35 land defenders have suffered violent deathsin the country since 2022.Frank Cruz, Conadeh’s coordinator of the Office of the Ombudsman for Indigenous and Afro-Honduran people, sayscases like the death of Silvas and his son will further dissuade land defenders from reporting environmental crimes. “The message sent is: ‘do not report, because if you report, you will be killed.’”Cruz believes there are several reasons why many Hondurans decide not to report environmental crimes. He says the state “does not have sufficient capacity” to respond to complaints, while some people living in remote territories “do not know their rights” and are unaware of the protection to which they are entitled.View image in fullscreenAna at Juan and Antonio’s graves.Photograph: Fritz Pinnow/The GuardianOthers, Cruz says, have faced threats of violence. According to him, impunity is contributing to the normalisation of violence against land defenders in Honduras.“If the aggressors or perpetrators of these crimes, deaths and acts of violence knew they would face investigation, charges, and prosecution at the hands of state organs, they would not commit these crimes,” Cruz says, adding that the government needs to implement medium- and long-term measures to “regain the confidence” of such communities. “The less impunity there is, the less normalisation. The more prosecution there is, the more awareness.”‘Just give me 30 men and a few arms’: Honduran Indigenous groups ready to fight to save landRead moreMauro Lara, the coordinator of community forest development at the ICF, worked with Juan as part of a forestry cooperative. According to Lara, while he has never formally registered any threats in the region where Juan was operating, it is likely that land defenders have faced them. “Generally, people are afraid to confront, or speak about, loggers. They are feared in the region,” he says.The country has previously faced condemnation for its handling of environmentalists’ murders. In April 2009,Honduras was sentenced by the Inter-American courtfor the death of Blanca Jeannette Kawas Fernández, an environmental activist who was shot and killed in February 1995.Kawas had publicly opposed illegal logging and economic projects to be implemented on the Punta Sal Peninsula on the northern coast. At least one agent of the state was found by the court to have been involved in her death.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold posters with an image of Indigenous leader and environmental activist Berta Cáceres, who was murdered in 2016.Photograph: Orlando Sierra/AFP/Getty ImagesIn March 2016, environmental activistBerta Cáceres was shot dead, sparking violent clashes.

Since 2018, López had been advocatingagainst a mining project in the Carlos Escaleras national park, named in memory of another Honduran environmentalist, who was murdered in October 1997.Over a month has passed since Silvas’ and Antonio’s deaths. No suspects have been arrested. There have been no updates since 19 March, when police commissioner Miguel Martínez said that the case was “nowin the hands of the public prosecutor’s office”, adding that “everything is moving forwards”.Explore more on these topicsHondurasSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanLogging and land-clearingDeforestationEnvironmental activismAmericasConservationTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, only two – Bess and Anne – are still in operation, and even those are faced with closure unless they can find raw materials to keep going.British Steel’s Chinese owners, Jingye, had planned to turn off another as soon as on Monday – using a process called a salamander tap – ahead of stopping all operations within weeks,with 2,700 jobs at risk.However, after taking control of the steelworks viaemergency legislation on Saturday, the government has directed British Steel to reverse course and do everything it can to keep production going.A line graph showing the decline of UK steel compared with all goods and services and manufacturing since 1990Why must blast furnaces be kept hot?Steel is made from iron ore. The problem is removing the oxygen tightly bound to the useful iron. The blast furnace’s innovation – a key contribution from Britain to the Industrial Revolution – was using coal and temperatures above 1,000C to reduce the iron, which is drawn out constantly as a liquid from the bottom of the blast furnace. (The oxygen is – unfortunately for the climate – turned intocarbon dioxide and vented into the air.)Blast furnaces are essentially 100-metre towers with an opening at the top for iron ore and coal, and a tap on the bottom to let out molten iron. They run continuously – all through Christmas, pandemics or financial crises – so letting them cool by too much would waste energy. However, the bigger problem comes if the metal solidifies. Then the risk is an immovable lump of iron and other leftovers known as slag, which blocks the bottom, leaving the furnace beyond repair.View image in fullscreenThe blast furnaces at the Scunthorpe plant.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockSo what exactly is a salamander tap?A salamander is a lizard-like amphibian, but for thousands of years in myth the creature was reputed to live in fire. The steel industry adopted the metaphor, using the word salamander to describe the remainders that sit at the very bottom of the furnace.A salamander tap, then, is the process of drilling a hole in the bottom of the blast furnace to let out, or tap, that molten metal and slag. That process means that the blast furnace could in future be restarted.Salamander taps are not unusual for blast furnaces. Over the decades in which they tend to operate, even the toughest materials lining the furnace break down and require replacement. That is possible only when the furnace has cooled, so tapping is required.Why are British Steel’s management keen to avoid a salamander tap?Working with molten metal is always dangerous, but technology such as remotely controlled drills has reduced the risk to life. However, costs can run into the millions of pounds, and the process requires a lot of preparation. It might be worthwhile for a blast furnace that will be restarted, but that calculation changes when a furnace is coming to the end of its life, as at Scunthorpe.Going down to a single blast furnace would be likely to deepen losses at Scunthorpe: British Steel would be left with most of the costs, but with half the output. For a company alreadylosing hundreds of millions of pounds, that would make recovery even harder.Does keeping the blast furnaces going save Scunthorpe in the long term?No. Anne and Bess are still thought to be in pretty bad shape after decades of under-investment under several owners. All blast furnaces wear out, but the consensus is that both the remaining furnaces at Scunthorpe are near the end of their lives.However, the government wants to keep them going untilcleaner electric arc furnaces can be built as a replacement. That would preserve jobs for at least a couple of years and retain British Steel’s customers – but building replacements could cost more than £1bn, which has not yet been committed.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryLincolnshireEnglandexplainersShareReuse this content"

Her band was huge – and then it fractured. She started two tours – and had to abandon them. The singer talks about 30 years of heaven and hellMon 14 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 04.59 EDTShareThe new album by Garbage, Let All That We Imagine Be the Light, has the kind of sound that makes you think you have always known it. You somehow know the words as they land; you have the tune in your head on a single listen. But try saying that to the Edinburgh-born singerShirley Manson, who – although she has lived mainly in the US for almost 30 years – is incredibly Scottish about flattery, which is to say she doesn’t like it. “I think possibly you just relate deeply to the lyrics of Chinese Fire Horse,” she says wryly, down the line from Los Angeles. That track is about life chewing you up and spitting you out because you are too old. No, I say firmly, one fiftysomething to another (she is 58), I don’t relate to that at all.Let All That We Imaginehas its roots in 2016, when Mansonfell off stage on the first day of the tour for Strange Little Birds, the last album but one. “I’m not blaming myself for my physical exuberance,” she says. “I was thinking about lyrics, I was thinking about my body, and I tumbled into the security barrier. I smashed my hip pretty badly, but it took five years for it to disintegrate.”That resulted in a hip replacement in 2023. “The physical recovery is surprisingly easy,” she says. “I mean, there’s a lot of indignity involved. I had to zoom around in a sweat suit with a walker. I’ll leave that image just there; I don’t need to embellish that.” Between the pain and the painkillers, though, she had terrible brain fog andGarbageended up writing the album remotely, the rest of the band – Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker – sending her musical ideas. “I felt really isolated. My band are not communicative at the best of times, and I was completely cut off from them. The only thing I would get would be these instrumentals with some zany titles.”Weirdly, it worked: they had an album to tour by last year, and were about to play their biggest UK gig in 15 years, at Ovo Arena Wembley, when Manson’s other hip “collapsed the day before” and she had to have that one replaced too. “It’s been very confronting. It makes you question everything, how you want to move forward in your life, particularly as I’m at this late stage in my career. It’s also been really fascinating, though, I’ve got to be honest with you – dark and depressing and soul-crushing, and also kind of wonderful.”“That’s such a Shirley Manson thing to say,” I say.“Oh, God, really?”View image in fullscreenManson onstage with Garbage last year in Wolverhampton, before the collapse of her hip.Photograph: Katja Ogrin/RedfernsOnly Happy When It Rains wasn’t technically the breakthrough Garbage single – that was Stupid Girl – but both were released in 1995 and became the soundtrack to the year: caustic, self-aware, catchy but not in a people-pleasing way. Manson herself had been, as she describes it, plucked from obscurity, on the dole in Scotland and trying to get paid to make music. “I was pretty miserable, and I got a phone call out of the blue: do you want to come and work with one of America’s most favoured sons? Before I knew it, I was off, flying to Madison, Wisconsin, working on a new record, with a brand new band, and these people I’d never met before, and it was a wild, wild experience.”That favoured son was Vig, who, then nearly 40, was famous as the producer of Nirvana’s Nevermind and was an all-purpose big beast of alternative rock, a credited producer on Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins albums. “It’s so mad,” Manson says. “In pop music terms, we were ancient when we started. I was the youngest member of the band, and I was 28, and we’re now 30 years on. That’s fucking bananas.”That eponymous debut album could do no wrong – it sold 4m copies worldwide and went double-platinum in the US, the UK and Australia. Manson says now that: “Butch in particular was credited with all our work, even though, to his eternal defence, he went out of his way to explain that the band worked as a band.” Truthfully, though, Manson had such panache that a whole bunch of us (by “us” I mean listeners to 90s indie rock) didn’t even notice the guys and thought this was a Scottish band, a frontwoman and her friends, and couldn’t figure out why they weren’t in the UK more often. We didn’t have Google then.“It’s funny you should say that,” she says, in a warm, you-idiot tone of voice. “As the years have progressed, I realise I don’t belong to anyone. Nobody really wants me. I’m definitely a Scottish artist, but Scotland has not really seen us as a Scottish band, and England obviously hasn’t seen us as a UK band, and then we come to America, and they think we’re some kind of transatlantic supergroup. We’ve landed nowhere, really.”View image in fullscreenManson with her bandmates.Photograph: Joseph CulticeThe 90s were also brutal to women in the music industry. “I was so young and I was hungry and distracted. I didn’t notice a lot of the micro-misogyny and the micro-sexism at first,” Manson says. “I was blinded by the dazzle of my career. I wasn’t paying attention. Back then, I read my own press, like a fool, and I was reading these horrible descriptions of me, really degrading or sexual in nature, or just nasty shit. It wasn’t just the male writers, although primarily the 90s music journalists were male. It really stung, and I found that hard.”Critique was often lascivious and slavering, but any amount of objectification was supposedly fine because it was always ironic, and that, in itself, was bullshit. But it morphed into a kind of bitterness and resentment, which I never understood. People would tear into Manson – and everyone: Kenickie, Sleeper, evenSalad– and I never really got where the anger came from.“I think it goes back to the 90s offering a different kind of woman, for the first time, arguably ever in culture,” Manson says. “Liberated, mouthy, opinionated, political, also often beautiful and powerful. At first, I think they thought it was a marvellous distraction, a joyous kink. And then, all of a sudden, they” – I’m going out on a limb to say “they”, here, are the patriarchy – “were like: ‘Wait a minute, these women are getting a lot of attention and taking up a lot of column space, and we’re going to crush it.’ Subconsciously, not deliberately, I don’t think. But there was a sense of: ‘You can go back to the hole that you crawled out of. Let’s get back to real music, serious music, proper creativity, important statements and important sounds coming from the men.’”It was a lot – endless horrible personal remarks from one direction and relentless, adulatory image-making from the other. “The problem with a lot of success is it comes with a lot of visual accompaniment. Your self is reflected back at you on every magazine. Some versions are gorgeous and fantastical and you look nothing like yourself – maybe there’s a small semblance of you in the eyes. And then there are incredibly unflattering ones … I wasn’t the right personality to deal with that. I found it repulsive. I didn’t get an iota of pleasure out of it. I felt that, if I was good enough, I would look like that image. But I don’t, so they have to augment it with lights and makeup and hair and stylists and nail manicurists. It really did a number on my self-esteem.”In the aftermath, Manson was open about her struggles with depression and body dysmorphic disorder, but that openness was distorted in the media as fragility, which now bugs the hell out of her. “I hate the phrase ‘mental health’, as applied to me. I have a very healthy psyche. I’m pretty tough, mentally. I have definitely suffered from bouts of depression. I see that as a healthy part of existing in the world. I think it’s really necessary. I think all this nonsense about us permanently having to feel ecstatic is silly.”View image in fullscreenOn tour with the band in 1998.Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesShe moved to the US in 1996. “Perhaps some other bands might have done well living in different continents,” she says, “but I don’t think it was on the cards for us.” By 2001, they were still flying high – Version 2.0 in 1998 had sold well, Beautiful Garbage did fine – but “we have to touch on the devastation wreaked by September 11 in the States,” she says. “That changed modern radio entirely, and one could argue it’s never really fully recovered since. Programming became really conservative: radio would only really play a certain sound – a very reassuring, unthreatening, fun vibe – and these very fierce women from the 90s just disappeared. That was when we started to see the rise of real mega-capitalist pop. We’ve been inundated with those sounds now for 20-odd years.”Manson loves pop. She loves Taylor Swift: “People make fun of her lyrics because they talk about an experience that they’re uninterested in, a very young woman coming of age, but make no mistake, Taylor Swift is a genius.” She loves Chappell Roan: “There’s nothing better than singing along to Pink Pony Club when you’ve just come off reading the news. Get me out of here, take me away, Chappell.” Yet she still lands the point, matter-of-factly, that mainstream music has been homogenised, in a way that makes me sad. But only later – it’s hard to feel sad while you are talking to Manson.In the mid-00s, the band went on a hiatus, cutting short the tour for their fourth album, Bleed Like Me, talking about solo projects. Manson’s mother developed dementia, and died in 2008, at which point, she says: “I was very depressed. Watching my mother die was the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life, and my career had stalled. I had to make a choice to pull myself out and up, into my life. I just started saying to myself: ‘You are an artist. You do this for a living. You’ve done it very successfully, and you can do it again. So let’s just go and start writing music and being musical, doing the work, filling it with love and interest and passion and having an idea of where it’s going.’ I never believed I was an artist until my mother died. I felt it was her last gift to me.”View image in fullscreenAt Brixton Academy in London in 1996.Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty ImagesGarbage rediscovered their enthusiasm for each other and found a new way of working when they reformed in 2010, the year that Manson also married Garbage’s sound engineer, Billy Bush. Her first marriage, to the Scottish artist Eddie Farrell, had ended in 2003. “When I was young, I broke my back trying to facilitate communication in this band, and it nearly killed me. In 2012, I thought: ‘If they want this as much as I want this, we will do this together. And if they don’t want to do it, then it’s over.’ I was just going to sit and hold my own seat without having to serve the group. And I don’t have any expectations of them any more. We love each other, and if one of us goes down, the whole team is on it – we swarm to each other’s side. But other than that, we exist as four pillars, with massive space between us.”But the 2012 album, Not Your Kind of People, was a critical but not a commercial success, the 2016 tour was an orthopaedic disaster, and the 2021 album, No Gods No Masters, explicitly political and denouncing “capitalist shortsightedness, racism, sexism and misogyny”, as she put it at the time, nearly made her “very, very ill. I managed to pull myself out of what felt like a very dark abyss. And I was driving my husband insane. He was saying: ‘You’ve got to stop this. You can’t save the world.’ And although I disagree with him – I do believe in singular action – I had to save myself.”On my radar: Shirley Manson’s cultural highlightsRead moreShe describes a pre-gig ritual Garbage have had since they reformed. “We started doing it at the beginning of each show. It’s a piss-take of what all these other bands do. We look as though we’re about to high-five each other, and then we miss each other’s hands. We’ve done it for years. But now, since my surgeries, every time I do this ritual, and the hands go sailing through the air, I have a tiny pinch of: ‘Are we being the very thing we’re taking the piss out of? Or am I wanting some real connection here?’”Just go for it, I advise. Make the authentic high-five.“I don’t know if I’ve got the moral courage. I don’t know if it’s possible for us. Everybody’s so fucked up, it’s amazing.”The funny thing is, there was a lot of to and fro before the interview about whether Manson would turn on her camera for our video call. She didn’t want to, and I let it drop because the aforementioned savage 90s media was bound to make a person wary. When it came to it, it was nothing to do with the 90s, she said. “I’m sorry, but I’m nude in my bedroom, and I really don’t think you would appreciate that.”I didn’t really need to know what she looked like – I just wanted to see her expressions. But you can pretty much always hear that she is smiling.Let All That We Imagine Be the Light is out on 30 May (BMG).Explore more on these topicsShirley MansonThe G2 interviewGarbagePop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Make no mistake about it.”ForTa-Nehisi Coates, the award-winning writer and journalist, the US president, Donald Trump, and his allies clearly understand the power of story-telling in politics. Coates has recently written a new book, The Message, and he tellsMichael Safithat the stories told in TV, films, literature and beyond are not a distraction from politics today but are actively shaping it.The pair discuss whether the political centre-left in the US has become uncomfortable competing in the cultural realm and is in many ways the more conservative movement, adopting the role of steward of the status quo. They also examine the role of white supremacy in the narratives emerging against progressive, identity politics.Coates describes a visit to the Middle East and the significant gulf he sees between how the Israel-Palestine conflict is portrayed in US media and what he witnessed on the ground. The writer also reflects from an African-American perspective on the stories being told about Israel and outlines the reaction to his book so far.Support the Guardian today:theguardian.com/todayinfocuspodPhotograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsTa-Nehisi CoatesToday in FocusDonald TrumpUS politics"

The RSF killed more than 200 civilians in the attacks.Photograph: AFP/GettyA senior diplomat, who is familiar with the leaked report but requested anonymity, said: “The UK needs to explain how it is responding tomassacres of childrenand aid workers while hosting the UAE at its London conference.”The 14-page report – completed last November and sent to the Sudan sanctions committee of the UN Security Council – was written by a panel of five UN experts who “documented a consistent pattern of Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo flights originating from the United Arab Emirates” into Chad, from where they identified at least three overland routes potentially used for transporting weapons into neighbouring Sudan.They found that the cargo flights from airports in the UAE to Chad were so regular that, in effect, they had created a “new regional air bridge”.They noted that flights demonstrated peculiarities, with planes often disappearing for “crucial segments” of their journey, a pattern that the experts said “raised questions of possible covert operations”.However, the experts added that they could not identify what the planes were carrying or locate any evidence that the planes were transporting weapons.The findings of numerous cargo flights from the UAE to Chad are not mentioned in the final report of the UN expert panel on Sudan, due to be published in a few days. No reference is made to the Emirates in the expert’s final 39-page report except in relation to peace talks.Questions over the UAE’s alleged role in backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) arrive after a weekend that saw its fighterskill more than 200 civiliansin a wave of violence against vulnerable ethnic groups in displacement camps and around the city ofEl Fasher, the last major city still held by the Sudanese army in Darfur, the vast western region of Sudan.“It will be shameful if the conference does not deliver concrete civilian protection in the context of ongoing genocide,” said the diplomat.In January the US formally declared that theRSF had committed genocidein Sudan.The UAE states that it is committed to bringing “lasting peace“ to Sudan.In their November update, the UN experts, investigating the possible smuggling of weapons from Chad into Darfur in possible violation of an arms embargo, identified at least 24 Ilyushin Il-76TD cargo flights landed at Amdjarass airport in Chad last year.The flights, they noted, coincided with an escalation of fighting in El Fasher, in particular a “surge in drone activity primarily by the RSF for combat and intelligence” whose arrival in Sudan, said the experts, marked “a new technological phase in the conduct of hostilities”.Some of the flights identified in the report were linked to operators previously connected to “military logistics and illicit arms transfers”. Two of them, said the experts, had previously been flagged for violations of the arms embargo.Experts also examined “regular departures” into Chad from two UAE airports – in Ras Al-Khaimah emirate and Al Ain in Abu Dhabi emirate – and found that the flights frequently disappeared from radars during crucial moments.On one occasion, the report describes how a flight “left Ras Al-Khaimah, vanished mid-flight, and later surfaced in N’Djamena [capital of Chad] before returning to Abu Dhabi”.Crucially, however, the UN experts said they could not prove that the planes were carrying weapons because the “flights lacked evidence regarding the specific content being transported”.Four of the five UN experts said that although the flights “marked an important new trend”, what they managed to uncover “failed to meet evidentiary standards regarding evidence of arms transfers”.For instance, although residents of the South Darfur city of Nyala reported “cargo plane activity and informants attributed it to RSF logistical operations, further triangulated evidence to confirm the nature of the cargo transported was absent”.Therefore, the experts said, it was “premature to infer that these flights were part of an arms transfer network”. They also added that the fact that several of the flights and cargo operators were linked to military logistics and past arms violations “did not provide proof of current arms transfers”.It added: “Additionally, patterns and anomalies in flight paths, such as mid-flight radar disappearances and unrecorded take-offs, raised concerns but did not offer verified evidence directly linking these flights to arms shipments.”View image in fullscreenLast week’s ICJ hearing, from left: Ameirah Al Hefeiti, UAE ambassador to the Netherlands; Abdalla Hamdan Al Naqbi; and Reem Ketait; both of the UAE foreign ministry.Photograph: ReutersIt said “closing these investigative gaps was crucial”.The revelations come days after the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague heard a case brought by Sudanaccusing the UAE of being “complicit in the genocide”during the war. The ICJ has heard claims that the RSF is responsible for serious human rights violations including mass killings, rape and forced displacement in West Darfur.The UAE has said the case is a cynical publicity stunt and a “platform to launch false attacks against the UAE”.A UAE source pointed out that the confidential UN expert report contained the disclaimer that four of the five panel members felt that “allegations of an airbridge from the UAE to Sudan via Chad failed to meet the evidentiary standards required to establish a clear link between the documented flights and the alleged transfer of arms”.Sudan’s news blackout stokes fear and confusion after refugee camp attacksRead moreA UAE statement added that the imminent final report from the Sudan expert panel did not reference the Emirates in relation to any flights “because the allegations against us failed to meet the panel’s evidentiary threshold. The record speaks for itself.”It added that they had been told by the UN security council’s Sudan sanctions committee that the final report “did not make any negative findings” against them.“The latest UN panel of experts report makes clear that there is not substantiated evidence that the UAE has provided any support to RSF, or has any involvement in the conflict,” said the statement.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanConflict and armsAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaUnited Arab EmiratesnewsShareReuse this content"

The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières said its team at Tawila, another displacement camp near El Fasher inDarfur, had seen about 10,000 people arrive in 48 hours suffering from dehydration and exhaustion.Campaigners said the dearth of information on the violence, which hasreportedly killed hundreds of civilians,highlighted the need for the London talks to prioritise restoring communications to allow communities under attack to warn each other, to give better access to healthcare and to facilitate human rights documentation.Altahir Hashim, whose family was living in Zamzam, said: “Zamzam as an IDP [internally displaced persons] camp no longer exists. The RSF has completely overrun the camp – killing, raping, burning and committing all kinds of atrocities. The communications are really bad and I haven’t been able to speak to my family.”View image in fullscreenA satellite photo of Zamzam camp of the damage after the RSF attack and, below, as it was in January. The RSF killed more than 200 people.Photograph: Maxar Technologies /AFP/GettyOn Friday,nine medical workersfrom the aid organisation Relief International were killed when the RSF raided Zamzam, while the Sudanese American Physicians Association (Sapa), said the manager of a children’s health centrewas also killed.For two decades Zamzam has hosted people displaced during the 2000s in attacks by the army and the Janjaweed militias – who were later formalised into the RSF – but its population has grown to about 700,000 during the current civil war as people have fled other parts of the Darfur region.Hashim is part of a group of Darfuris abroad who have raised funds to buy and airdrop satellite phones into Darfur as well as walkie-talkies to allow local communication during emergencies.He said the communications blackout also made it difficult for people to receive money sent from relatives abroad through mobile banking systems.View image in fullscreenPeople who fled Zamzam camp, after it fell under RSF control, rest near Tawila. The camp’s population grew to about 700,000 during the civil war.Photograph: AFP/GettyThe limited information that has emerged from Zamzam has often relied on satellite communications – whether through imagery, phones or the Starlink service, which uses satellites rather than land-based communication towers to provide internet.But these services can be unreliable and are costly, meaning that while they are used by some activists in Darfur, others remain unable to be contacted.One video shared by the group North Darfur Observatory for Human Rights showed people fleeing Zamzam with theirbelongings strapped to camels and donkeys.2:16Footage shows people fleeing Zamzam with their belongings strapped to camels and donkeys – videoOften the main source of information from Darfur has come from videosrecorded by RSF fighters themselvesof the atrocities and some have emerged showing their fightersentering Zamzam on pickup trucks mounted with heavy machine gunswith burning buildings in the background.Shayna Lewis, from the US-based organisationPreventing & Ending Mass Atrocities(Paema).“We have reports of civilians being hunted and executed in the streets of Zamzam, but we are unable to consistently communicate with people as the networks are off and the internet can only be accessed through Starlink access points. Starlink access is sporadic, expensive and can be turned off by the belligerents at will.”More than 200 civilians killed as Sudan’s RSF attacks Darfur displacement campsRead morePaema said the talks in London should prioritise restoring communications as a way to quickly relieve suffering in Sudan.Sapa, which operates medical facilities in El Fasher, said the last message it received from its teams in Zamzam on Sunday afternoon was: “Zamzam under the control of the RSF.”Khalid Mishain, of the Sudanese human rights group Youth Citizens Observers Network, said they had lost contact with their observers in the area since the attack. He said the communications blackout had been a impediment to human rights documentation throughout the conflict.“People have to write the information down, keep it with them and then secretly move to areas where there is communications and send it to us,” said Mishain.“We have civilians suffering and no one knows about it, and those who report on it have to risk their life because of the communications blackout.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSudanAfricaConflict and armsWar crimesInternally displaced peopleDarfurnewsShareReuse this content"

The French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, has warned that if the expulsions go ahead Paris would be forced to respond immediately.The influencer, Amir Boukhors, 41, is acritic of the Algerian president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, and has more than a million subscribers on TikTok where he posts as Amir DZ. He has lived in France since 2016 and was granted political asylum in 2023. Algeria has issued nine international arrest warrants against him on accusations of fraud and terrorism but France refuses to extradite him.In April 2024, Boukhors was snatched outside his home in the Val-de-Marne, south of Paris, tellingFrance2 television in a later interview that he was handcuffed and bundled into a car by four men wearing police armbands. He claimed he was drugged and held in a “container” for more than 24 hours before being released at 3am. “I fell into a trap,” he said.Three men were arrested and put under investigation on Friday for the “kidnap, holding and arbitrary detention” of Boukhors. France’s national anti-terrorist prosecutor confirmed that one of the men arrested works for the Algerian consulate at Créteil, south-east of Paris.Algeria’s ordering of the expulsion of French embassy staff came a week after Barrot concluded an official visit to Algeria where he met Tebboune.“I ask the Algerian authorities to stop these expulsion measures that have no link to an ongoing legal case,” he said on Monday. “If the decision to expel our staff is maintained we will have no other choice than to respond immediately.”AFP reported that among the embassy staff ordered to leave the country were a number of members attached to France’s interior ministry whose minister, Bruno Retailleau, has taken a hard line against the former French colony.Bilateral relations between Paris and Algiers have been tense since last July when France supported a Moroccan plan to grant autonomy to the western Sahara against Algerian-backed insurgents who want full independence for the disputed territory. Paris has accused Algeria of refusing to take back its nationals ordered to leave France and considered a security threat. In retaliation, France has threatened to slash the number of visas given to Algerians.Emmanuel Macron has also called on Algeria to release writerBoualem Sansal, 75, sentenced to five years in prison for “undermining the integrity” of the country.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But for several tiny countries, their key exports are agricultural commodities, for which the US is unlikely to be able to find substitutes elsewhere – let alone develop a domestic industry.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As many as 32 countries were eligible, before Trump’s announcement appeared to tear up the scheme.Financial markets and manufacturers in developing countries are continuing to wrestle with the changeable nature of US trade policy.Trump sowed fresh confusion over the weekend byappearing to revisit an announcement made on Friday, that some hi-tech goods, including laptops, would be exempt from tariffs.In a post on his social media site Truth Social on Sunday, the president said no one was getting “off the hook”, and the administration would be investigating the “whole electronics supply chain”.Explore more on these topicsTariffsGlobal economyTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUnctadUS politicsUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s up to them,” Bondi said. “The supreme court ruled that if El Salvador wants to return him, we would ‘facilitate’ it, meaning provide a plane.”The remarks at the Oval Office meeting marked an escalation in the Trump administration’s attempts to claim uncertainty with court orders to avoid having to take actions it dislikes. In Abrego García’s case, officials appeared to manufacture uncertainty in particularly blatant fashion.And the fact that the US is paying El Salvador to detain deportees it sends to the notorious Cecot prison undercut the notion that the administration lacked the power to return Abrego García into US custody.The case started when Abrego García was detained by police in 2019 in Maryland, outside a Home Depot, with several other men, and asked about a murder. He denied knowledge of a crime and repeatedly denied that he was part of a gang.Abrego García was subsequently put in immigration proceedings, where officials argued they believed he was part of the MS-13 gang in New York based on his Chicago Bulls gear and on the word of a confidential informant.The case went before aUS immigrationjudge, who suggested that Abrego García could be a member of MS-13 and agreed to a deportation order but shielded him from being sent to El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution there by a local gang.The Trump administration did not appeal against that decision, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has since said in a court filing that Abrego García’sdeportation to El Salvador was an “administrative error”. The supreme court also called his removal illegal.In earlier remarks to reporters on Monday morning, Miller expressly demonstrated he knew the administration had made a mistake because the immigration judge had issued a so-called withholding order, which meant he could not be deported to El Salvador.“When you have a withholding order, to be clear, that is not ‘pause your deportation’. In other words, in the worst-case scenario, it means you get deported to another country,” Miller said.That concession evaporated hours later when he joined Trump, Bukele and a dozen senior officials in the Oval Office and suggested that bringing back Abrego García to the US would be tantamount to kidnapping a citizen of El Salvador.Miller appeared to be suggesting that the US could not force the actions of El Salvador, a sovereign nation. But he then said the supreme court said neither the president nor the secretary of state could forcibly retrieve a citizen of El Salvador from El Salvador - which the order did not say.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorUS politicsAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

But instead of “facilitating” his return as ordered by the supreme court, the administration has trapped Abrego García in a catch-22 by offshoring his fate to a jurisdiction beyond the reach of legality – or, it would seem, basic logic or common decency.The paradox is this: the Trump administration says it cannot facilitate the return of Abrego García because he is in a prison in El Salvador. El Salvador says it cannot return him because that would betantamount to “smuggling” him into the US.The absurdity of the position played out on Monday during an Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Bukele where the two men appeared to enjoy mocking the powerlessness of the US courts to intervene in the fate of anyone caught in the maws of the Trump administration’s deportation machine.“How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I’m not going to do it,” Bukele said when asked about whether he would help to return Abrego García.There is no evidence that Abrego García is a terrorist or a member of the gang MS-13 as the Trump administration has claimed. But that is not really important here.“I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” Bukele said during a meeting with the US president on Monday. “They’d love to have a criminal released into our country,” Trump added.Trump’s lieutenants also jumped in on Monday, arguing that they could not intervene in the case because Bukele is a foreign citizen and outside of their control.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Increasingly, the administration is including questions of immigration in that foreign policy in order to defy the courts.Monday’s presentation was in effect a pantomime. Both sides could quickly intervene if they wanted to. But this was a means to an end. Miller said this case would not end with Abrego García living in the US.More broadly, it indicates the Trump administration’s modus operandi: to move quickly before the courts can react to its transgressions and, when they do, to deflect and defy until the damage done cannot be reversed.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationEl SalvadorMarylandUS politicsAmericasMarco RubioanalysisShareReuse this content"

I’m not going to do it.”He added: “I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” and said he would not release the man, Kilmar Abrego García, intoEl Salvadoreither. “I’m not very fond of releasing terrorists into the country.”The comments came a day after theTrump administrationclaimed it was not legally obligated to secure the return of Abrego García, despite the US supreme court ruling that the administration should “facilitate” bringing him back.Lawyers for the justice department argued in courtfilings onSunday that asking El Salvador to returnAbrego García from a notorious mega-prison should be considered “foreign relations”, and was therefore outside the scope of the courts.Trump lawyers confirm wrongly deported Maryland man in El Salvador prisonRead moreThe filing said “the federal courts have no authority to direct the Executive Branch to conduct foreign relations in a particular way, or engage with a foreign sovereign in a given manner,” adding: “That is the exclusive power of the president as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations.”Earlier this month, the Trump administrationacknowledgedthat Abrego García, an immigrant from El Salvador who was living in Maryland with protected status, was deported to a prison in El Salvador on 15 March as a result of an “administrative error”. In 2019 an immigration judge had prohibited the federal government from deporting him.When he was deported anyway, swept up in Trump’s effort to send hundreds of supposed gang members to El Salvador without due process, Abrego García’s wife and relatives filed a lawsuit against theTrump administration.On 4 April a district judge, Paula Xinis,directed the administration to “facilitate and effectuate”his return. The supreme courtupheldthe directive on Thursday, and also instructed Xinis to clarify the order “with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.Supreme court orders US to help return man wrongly deported to El SalvadorRead moreOn Friday, Xinissaid in a hearing that it was“extremely troubling” that theadministrationhad failed to comply with a court order to provide details about Abrego García’s whereabouts and status. She ordered that itprovide daily updateson efforts to facilitate his return.On Saturday,the Trump administration confirmed Abrego Garcíawas alive and confined in El Salvador’s mega-prison, Cecot.Then, on Sunday, the justice department said it interpreted the court’s order to “facilitate” Albrego García’s return as only requiring them to “remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien’s ability to return here”.It added: “No other reading of ‘facilitate’ is tenable – or constitutional – here.”In aseparate court filingon Sunday, an official from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) said that the 2019 order preventing Abrego García’s removal to El Salvador was no longer valid, as a result of the administration’s allegation that he was a member of the MS-13 gang, “which is now a designated foreign terrorist organization”, the court filing states.On Monday, during the Oval Office meeting between Trump and Bukele, Stephen Miller, White House homeland security adviser, repeated the claim that the 2019 order was no longer valid when Abrego García was deported, and said that bringing him back to the US would be “to kidnap a citizen of El Salvador and fly him back here”.The attorney general, Pam Bondi, echoed that it was up to El Salvador “whether they want to return him”, not the US. Bondi also claimed the supreme court ruling meant that “if El Salvador wants to return him, we would ‘facilitate’ it, meaning provide a plane”.But Miller also said: “No version of this ends with him living here.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationUS politicsEl SalvadorAmericasDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Another displayed the name of Conservative national campaign director, Jenni Byrne, crossed out, with “Kory Teneycke” written underneath – referring to a leading Conservative strategist who has been publicly bashing Poilievre.The CSFN conference, Canada’s less idealistic version of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), serves as a key gathering for conservative-minded Canadians to discuss policy proposals and network.The incident comes in the final stretch of a heated campaign only weeks away from elections, in which the Liberals who hold a polling lead have consistently sought to characterize Poilievre as Canada’s version of Trump.Poilievre’s confrontational style with mainstream media, his “Canada First” campaign slogan, and his frequent attacks on the CBC specifically as “government-funded media” have fueled these comparisons, despite his insistence on fundamental differences between himself and the US president. Just this Sunday on Radio-Canada’s popular talkshow Tout le monde en parle, whenasked if he wasa “mini-Trump, medium Trump or large Trump”, Poilievre quipped about his lighter weight before emphasizing his “completely different story” as the child of middle-class teachers compared with the US president’s inherited wealth.The Liberal party confirmed the incident on Sunday evening, saying some campaigners had “regrettably got carried away” with buttons “poking fun” at reported Conservative infighting. A party spokesperson, Kevin Lemkay, added that the Liberal leader, Mark Carney, had made it clear “this does not fit his commitment to serious and positive discourse”.Over the years, Poilievre has proudly associated himself as a culture warrior for Canada’s right, saying he wants thecountry to move away from“woke” to “warrior” and appearing on rightwing media like the Canadian influencer Jordan Peterson’s show.The Liberal party has been able to take advantage of linking Poilievre to Trump after near country-wide disappointment and disapproval that followed the US president’s targeting of Canada as the supposed “51st state” and choosing to include its previously friendly neighbor in mass tariffs. As a result, there has been anear-total plungein Canadian tourism to the United States, and the Liberalshold a tight leadin the polls under new leader Carney.“Despite their public claims, it’s clear that it’s the Liberals who are attempting to bring American-style politics to our country,” the Conservative party spokesperson, Sam Lilly, said in a statement to CBC.Explore more on these topicsCanadaDonald TrumpAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Whether we like it or not, the people voted democratically and we must be honest and recognise it,” Aquiles Álvarez, the RC mayor of Ecuador‘s largest city, Guayaquil, said on X. “The worst is to be a bad loser.”International observers from the European Union (EU) and the Organization of American States (OAS) monitored the vote. They have not yet published their reports, but on Monday the OAS expressed its confidence in the official results.According to the statement, the OAS observer mission “conducted a comparison of tally sheets at the observed polling stations and was able to verify consistency between the transmitted sheets, those received by the parties, and those returned in the electoral package”.The margin of victory – more than 1.1m votes – was significantly larger than suggested by opinion polls, which had indicated a technical tie, as well as the result of thefirst round in February, when Noboa had beaten González by just 16,746 votes (0.17%).Noboa’s term has been defined by an“internal armed conflict”he declared in January 2024 against drug trafficking gangs.He placed the armed forces at the centre of hismano dura(iron fist) offensive, which initially led to a drop in crime – soon followed by a surge in reports ofhuman rights violationsand a return to previous levels of violence.Once one of the safest countries in Latin America, Ecuador registered thehighest homicide rate in the region in 2024.The populationalso facedan energy crisis that led to scheduled blackouts of up to 14 hours, a shrinking GDP, andrising poverty levels– yet the incumbent emerged victorious.The heir to a banana fortune will now serve a full term in office – until 2029 – as his current 17 months in power were to complete the term of former president Guillermo Lasso, who dissolved Congress and stepped down to avoid impeachment.In the2023 snap election, Noboa also defeated González in the runoff but by a much narrower margin: 51.83% to 48.17%.Voting is compulsory in Ecuador, and, according to the National Electoral Council, 83.76% of eligible voters turned out.One move by Noboa on the eve of the election sparked controversy.Less than 24 hours before polls opened, the president signed a decree declaring a 60-daystate of emergency– something that has been a frequent feature of his presidency – suspending the right to freedom of assembly and authorising warrantless searches.The president claimed there was a “serious internal disturbance” in light of rising violence levels, but the decision was sharply criticised by the opposition, Indigenous movements and even Congress.View image in fullscreenEcuadorian presidential candidate Luisa González addresses supporters in Quito on Sunday.Photograph: Karen Toro/ReutersDespite once again coming close to becoming the first female president in Ecuador’s history, González’s competitiveness had more to do with her political patron Correa, who governed Ecuador from 2007 to 2017.A split betweenCorreístas– the former president’s supporters, such as González – and anti-Correístashas since polarised Ecuador. Correa has lived in Belgium since leaving office and was convicted by an Ecuadorian court in 2020 for corruption during his presidency.In the speech in which she said she would not recognise the election result, González claimed that none of the opinion polls showed such a large margin and that Noboa had abused his power by not stepping down from office to run, as required by law.“This is a dictatorship, and this is the biggest electoral fraud that we, the Ecuadorians, are witnessing,” she said.To the Ecuadorian outletPrimicias, Noboa said it was regrettable that González would not accept defeat. “I find it regrettable that, with an 11- or 12-point difference, she’s still trying to somehow question the will of the Ecuadorian people. The Ecuadorians have already spoken, and now it’s time to get to work starting tomorrow,” he said.Explore more on these topicsEcuadorAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Addressing reporters at the White House, he continued to threaten new tariffs on pharmaceutical goods.As fears of a potential downturncontinue to mount, Kevin Hassett, the director of the US national economic council, pushed back against warnings that a recession could take hold this year. “100% not,” he told Fox Business.Leading tech stocks struggled for direction amid confusion over theTrump administration’s stance on key US imports including smartphones and semiconductors.While it emerged that such electronic goods and components were exempt from the sweeping tariffs imposed this month, Trump and his officials have signaled they may not be spared for long.“THE BEST DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE IS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday, as firms around the world struggled to keep up with the latest developments, let alone judge what might happen next.Consumers are starting to feel the impact of the trade tensions. Sonyincreased the price of its PlayStation 5by 25% in some markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania, citing “a challenging economic environment” as the video game industry reels from the impact of Trump’s tariffs.China, meanwhile, has vowed to stand firm in the face of Trump’s tariffs.The world’s second-largest economy has diversified its trade away from the US in recent years, according to Lyu Daliang, a customs administration spokesperson, in commentsreported by state-owned agency Xinhua.Beijing has retaliated forcefully to Washington’s tariffs, with125% levieson US imports against the US’s total of 145% border taxes on goods moving the other way. The trade war has prompted turmoil on financial markets since Trump first revealed tariffs on every country in the world on 2 April. Since then he has partly retreated on the highest levies on most trading partners for at least 90 days, but has doubled down in his spat with China.Line graph shows markets in Germany, China, UK, Canada, US and Japan falling sharply after Trump announced his new tariffs policy on 2 April, and then rebounding in the days that followedThe White House offered further relief over the weekend with an exemption from the steepest tariffs forelectronics including smartphones, laptops and semiconductors. But Trump officials later appeared to walk that back with the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying such devices would be “included in the semiconductor tariffs which are coming in probably a month or two”.Trump said on Sunday night on Truth Social that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” highlighting that smartphones were still subject to 20% levies and suggesting they could still rise higher.However, investors on Monday appeared unconvinced by Trump’s attempts to play down the retreat. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose by 2.2% and the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges climbed by 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The economic consequences for both will hurt.The US’s $150bn (£113bn) or so of exports to China will fall away quickly, while China’s $440bn worth of exports to the US may drop by up to 75% over the next 18 months, unless some sort of negotiation happens. No one will be spared the effects.The consequences could tip the US into a mild recession this summer, and are undermining one of the country’s principal weapons, namely the power, leverage and reach of its financial system. The leading indicators of consumer confidence, inflation, and capital spending are all flashing warning signs. It is also an ill wind that last week brought both rising bond yields in the US Treasury market and a falling dollar.This trade war is distinctly unwelcome for the Chinese Communist party, which only last month revealed its alarm at the underlying fragility of China’s economy. Chinese exports were on fire last year, accounting for half of its growth and expanding three times as fast as world trade. The country ran a $2tn trade surplus in manufactured goods. The government can ill-afford a trade torpedo as it tries to stabilise its beleaguered property sector, along with debt and asset deflation in local governments, and finance.Trade negotiations would not be a panacea for the fundamental issues that divide these two powers, but they might … at least keep dialogue going.Donald Trump and Xi Jinping boast resilience and determination, but have reasons to pull back, if not call off, the trade dogs of war. The chances of immediate rapprochement look poor, but not hopeless. China’s ministry of commerce said over the weekend it would ignore future US escalation. The US announced tariff exemptions for smartphones, chips, and electronic equipment, though only temporarily. Some sort of eventual transactional “deal” – some rollback of high tariffs, maybeTikTok, other issues – still seems probable.The US wants to contain and decouple from China, but has not as yet exercised some of its more potent financial and export control weapons.China has been pursuing decoupling under the slogan of self-reliance for a long time, and if Xi wanted to, he could shut down any chance of talks by devaluing the yuan much more aggressively, and targeting a swathe of US firms.Trade negotiations would not be a panacea for the fundamental issues that divide these two powers, but they might buy some time and at least keep dialogue going.Implications for the rest of the world were hinted at, curiously, by the crisis surrounding British Steel and its Chinese owner, Jingye Group. Seemingly a world away, there is though an important connection. In the firm’s UK and French plants, Jingye has been able to make, finish and export steel, branding it “Made in UK” and so avoid steel tariffs and other trade restrictions when selling to the EU and US.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTrump warns exemptions on smartphones, electronics will be short-lived, promises future tariffsRead moreIn addition to using investment in this way, China has also had growing recourse to “trans-shipment”, or the practice of using third countries, especially in Asia, such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India, and also Mexico, to bypass sanctions and trade barriers, and obfuscate country of origin. About a quarter of all China’s exports are now trans-shipped. US so-called “reciprocal tariffs” on more than 100 countries, with the top tariffs applying in Asia, were designed partly to stop this from happening.The recently announced 90-day pause in these tariffs (ex-China) were both a reaction to stabilise the US’s battered financial markets, but also a window in which the US hopes that several important countries will negotiate new trade arrangements with Washington, possibly including restrictions on trade and investment with China.The EU and the UK appear now in “pause” mode with respect to retaliation, formal channels have opened with Japan and South Korea, and the US reports encouraging signals from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and India, for example. It is a complicated picture. Many countries are highly integrated into China’s trading system, but many have also implemented trade measures against China to protect their own manufacturing, jobs and communities. No one wants to lose access to the US consumer market, which is 30% of the world total. China’s mercantilist character means it will not and cannot fill the gap, and wants only to expand its exports.The manner in which the Trump administration is prosecuting this trade war is chaotic and often barely thought out. Yet, it is important not to lose sight of the reason that trade conflict has erupted in the first place, and that is as reaction to China’s surging trade surplus. This comes from a political system that gives exceptionally large support to its companies, distorts competition, restricts market access and imposes real economic costs on other nations.

The tariff, which has been paused, threatens to devastate the country’s ambitious economic growth plan.Xi’s visit was reportedly planned prior to Trump’s tariff announcement. During meetings Vietnam andChinawill sign about 40 agreements across different sectors, Vietnam’s deputy prime minister, Bùi Thanh Sơn, said on Saturday. It is expected this will include cooperation to develop Vietnam’s railway network.How Trump tariffs could push Vietnam into the arms of ChinaRead moreVietnam’s leader, Tô Lâm, wrote in an article published in state media on Monday that Hanoi wanted to boost cooperation in defence, security and infrastructure, especially on rail links.Xi’s visit willprobably form part of an effort to prevent economic encirclement by the US and in the region, said Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme of the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who cited reports that Washington would prioritise trade negotiations with countries such as Vietnam, Japan, South Korea and India.For Vietnam, Giang added, Xi’s visit presented “a risk and an opportunity”.Vietnam, and many other south-east Asian countries, are trying to maintain a delicate balancing act between the US and China. The US is Vietnam’s main export market, with US exports accounting for 30% of Vietnam’s GDP. However, China is Vietnam’s top import source, which it relies on for raw materials and other supplies that will be used to produce exports destined for the US.Vietnam has traditionally sought to avoid taking sides between the US and China and will want to avoid antagonising either party, especially as it tries to persuade Washington to lower tariffs.Vietnam is vulnerable to Washington’s tariffs because its trade surplus with the US has grown rapidly over recent years to more than $123bn (£94bn), fuelled in part by companies relocating production to Vietnam to avoid tariffs imposed on China by the last Trump administration.Hanoi is preparing to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped from its territory to the US, in an effort to appease Washington, according to a Reuters report, and to tighten controls on sensitive exports to China. It has also made other concessions, including offering to remove all tariffs on US imports and promising to buy more US goods.Cambodia and Malaysia, which face tariffs of 49% and 24% respectively, are also seeking to negotiate with Donald Trump, whileChina has previously vowedto “fight until the end” if the US continued to escalate the trade war.Hanoi will want to avoid being seen as moving too close to Beijing during Xi’s visit, given the tension between China and Washington, said Giang, but he added that China may be able to offer a “life-saving opportunity for Vietnamese economy … at least in the short run”.This could include a commitment from China not to export its excess capacity to Vietnam. Across many south-east Asian countries there is concern that tariffs imposed on China by the US will worsen a problem of cheap Chinese goods overwhelming domestic industries. China could also increase its imports from south-east Asia, including in areas such as agriculture.A willingness to pursue peaceful solutions to the dispute in the South China Sea, where Beijing and several south-east Asian countries have overlapping claims, would also improve perceptions of China in the region, added Giang.“Now we are viewing the US as a global disruptor – that presents China a golden opportunity to be a responsible stakeholder in the region. And if they can do so, I think more and more south-east Asian countries will eventually move closer to China,” Giang said.Explore more on these topicsChinaXi JinpingTrump tariffsVietnamCambodiaAsia PacificMalaysianewsShareReuse this content"

The couple’s son, a university academic, lives inHong Kong, and they were visiting to see their three-month-old grandson.“And at the end of about three hours, my husband was told he was free to go but I was denied entry, and I was going to go back on the next plane home,” Hobhouse said.The Bath MP said that while she tried to be “cooperative and friendly” in the expectation she would eventually be allowed in, on being told she could not, she “slightly lost it” and demanded an explanation, but was told only: “We are so sorry, Madam, we understand.”She said: “No explanation was given to me, ever. And this is what is so chilling, and should really be a wake-up call for any parliamentarian, because I had no warning that I was on the blacklist.”China has in the past publiclybanned several British MPsfrom entering the country, including Iain Duncan Smith and Nusrat Ghani who, like Hobhouse, are members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac).Ipac is an international group of politicians that scrutinises Beijing’s approach to human rights and has criticised the crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong.Hobhouse said her apparent presence on “a sort of hidden blacklist” appeared likely to be connected to her membership of Ipac.“I’m a member of Ipac,” she said. “Ipac is watching the human rights adherence, or not, of the Chinese Communist party, but I’m not more outspoken than other MPs about criticising the Chinese Communist party.“Therefore anybody who ultimately is seen as standing up for freedom, democracy and human rights should feel that they are going to be targeted by the Chinese authorities. And that is really, really chilling.”Asked how she felt personally about not being able to see her grandchild, Hobhouse said it was “depressing”. She said: “There are many, many more tragedies that are far, far worse, but I am sad.”Asked about Hobhouse’s case by Sky, Murray said: “We are very concerned about this. We need to find out exactly what happened. And I know that the trade minister, Douglas Alexander, who is in China at the moment, has raised this with authorities there.“Clearly, it would not be right to prevent a British MP from entering another country purely on the basis of what they had said as a parliamentarian.”Explore more on these topicsLiberal DemocratsHong KongChinaAsia PacificHuman rightsCommunismFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

It testednew landing bargeson ships that could facilitate an amphibious assault on Taiwan. And it unveiled deep-sea cable cutters with the ability to switch off another country’s internet access – a tool no other nation admits to having.China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific to send a message of supremacy to its regional neighbours, experts say. But it’s also testing the thinking of a bigger rival further afield:Donald Trump.Since Trump took office in January, he and his cabinet members have focused their China strategy on tariffs and havelaunched an escalating trade war with Beijing. They had been largely silent on China’s growing acts of aggression in the Indo-Pacific’s seas.‘America is going down’: China can capitalise on damage caused by Trump, former PLA colonel saysRead moreThat’s starting to change.On April 1, theUS state department condemned Beijing’s“aggressive military activities and rhetoric” in relation to unannounced military drills in the Taiwan Strait, which have become bigger in scale in recent months and are increasingly resembling actual invasion. That came on the heels of a visit to the region byUS defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he assured Japan and the Philippines that America would continue to defend them against China. He clarified the US had not changed its status quo stance on Taiwan, and the Pentagon reiterated China remained theUS’ biggest threat.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump with secretary of state Marco Rubio, left, and defence secretary Pete Hegseth, right.Photograph: Molly Roberts/White House/Planet Pix/ZUMA Press Wire/REX/ShutterstockBut the US’s Indo-Pacific allies will want to hear those assurances from Trump, who has not shown his cards on issues like Taiwan. When asked by a journalist in February for his stance,Trump refused to be drawnand has said nothing on Taiwan since. He’s not afraid to diverge from his senior advisers, and hishaphazard approach to Ukraine ceasefire talks– and tariffs – gives little confidence the president has a consistent, long-term strategy on any given global affair.“The Chinese are watching what’s happening with the Trump administration and seeing how far they can push things,” said Malcolm Davis, a senior analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.And in their testing of Trump, the seas around China are likely to become more restive, Davis said, adding that China will keep ratcheting up its drills in theTaiwanStrait and target countries with which it has territorial disputes, including the Philippines and Japan.“China will be more willing to impose the risk of casualties on the Philippines through ramming ships and so forth. It might go fromusing water cannonto something a bit more aggressive,” Davis said. “The goal is to intimidate Manila into accepting China’s interests.”How heavily involved the US military should get in the Indo-Pacific and how far the US should go to protect Taiwan fromChinaare issues that have divided Trump’s most senior officials, according to a former state department staffer who worked in Trump’s initial weeks in office.“There are definitely different competing camps that you could liken to a royal court, all competing for the last word and influence with Trump,” the former staffer said. “There is definitely a split over Taiwan policy between traditional NatSec folks like (Marco) Rubio and (Mike) Waltz versus Maga folks.”But which side Trump is on isn’t clear.Sam Roggeveen, director of the Lowy Institute’s international security program, said it was known that a faction of the Trump administration wanted to turn away from Europe. “But it’s not at all clear that he agrees with the second part of it – doing more in Asia,” he said.What is clear from Trump’s posture in Ukraine talks is that he is open to putting deals on trade and major geopolitical issues on the same table. He also has a tendency to change his stance on a subject in a matter of days.Donald Trump says he is ‘very angry’ with Vladimir Putin over UkraineRead moreBeijing will be watching to see how Trump sways. If Russia’s Vladimir Putin can strike a grand bargain with Trump by using economic incentives in exchange for Ukrainian land, Beijing may look to do the same with Taiwan.And that’s causing anxiety among the US’s closest allies in the Indo-Pacific, said Jenny Schuch-Page, managing principal in energy and sustainability with the Washington-based Asia Group. “Even the prospect for a ‘grand bargain’ with China will make countries in South-east Asia wary about how they will fare,” she said.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, did not comment on whether Beijing was looking for such a deal, but he said China “deplores” the US’ criticisms of its drills near Taiwan, calling them “a mischaracterisation of the facts and truth and an interference in China’s internal affairs.”What Trump is likely to focus on is staying competitive with China, which is ahead in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics, electric vehicles and 6G internet.The lack of a long-term China strategy is problematic, according to Danny Russel, a former US diplomat and vice-president of international security and diplomacy with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington.He points to mass firings in the country’s intelligence services, which included laying off dedicated China researchers from the CIA, as a dangerous move in terms of security and the US’s bargaining position in trade talks.China will probably try to recruit those laid off for its own intelligence gathering on the US, he said. AReuters reportsuggests it already is.“We’re blinding ourselves at a moment when the national security and economic interests of the United States and our allies call for clarity,” Russel said.How China is using salami slicing tactics against Taiwan – videoThedefunding of Radio Free Asia– a sister organisation of Voice of America – is another own-goal, Russel said, cutting off a valuable source of information from China and other countries that are difficult to report from, like North Korea.“It’s a kind of unilateral disarmament in the information space at a time when China, Russia, and North Korea are ramping up,” Russel said of the cuts. “Why are we voluntarily giving up our best tools of competition? There’s a big difference between belt-tightening and self-sabotage.”That may become a security concern for countries like Australia, which has a long tradition of sharing intelligence back and forth with the US. China is likely to ramp up its missions in international waters near Australia, Davis and Roggenveen said, so a reliable flow of information on China is crucial.A Chinese research vessel making a loop around Australia is a case in point. The Tan Suo Yi Hao has been cruising international waters off Australia’s southern and western coasts for two weeks surveying subsea communication cables – critical infrastructure thatallows Australians to send everything from emails to military secrets.“I’d prefer it wasn’t there,” is about as much as Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese could say when asked by journalists for his thoughts.Without a strong signal on the region from Trump, there could be more Chinese ships to come.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificTaiwanDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

They asked witnesses to contact Crimestoppers.Hosar, who has lived in the area for 18 years but did not know the dead woman, said the violence was “part of living on Dickens Road”.“Every few weeks there’s a lot of police presence,” she said.“Dickens Road always gets the negative [attention] but we do have some really nice people that live on Dickens Road and in Campbelltown in general.”Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsNew South WalesSydneyAustralian police and policingnewsShareReuse this content"

Overseas arrivals to the US from all origins dropped 11.6% in March, the government data showed.The downturn in travel following Trump’s inauguration exceeded even the global tourism industry’s worst case predictions,according to travel analytics group Tourism Economics.Chart showing change in overseas visitors to the US since March 2024Aside from the long-term weakness in the Australian dollar meaning more expensive holidays, a string of incidents with US border protocols since January may have left some reconsidering their destination.Guardian Australia last week reported the case ofan Australian man with a working visa who was detained and deportedon returning to the US. The man alleged border officials called him “retarded” and boasted “Trump is back in town”.Meanwhile, an award-winning Australian comediancancelled a planned trip to the US after receiving legal advicethat she could be stopped at the border due to her previous jokes about the Trump administration.The incidents haveprompted unease among Australian academics, many of whom are now refusing to attend US conferences for fear of being detained.Gender-diverseAustralians have also been warnedthey may face visa delays following Trump’s executive order on gender.Australian academics refuse to attend US conferences for fear of being detainedRead moreJames Kavanagh, Flight Centre’s chief executive of leisure travel, said that while the US has long been a firm favourite for Australian travellers, “we must acknowledge the political environment in the US and the fact that it may influence Australians’ decisions on where they choose to travel”.“For example, looking at the first quarter of 2024 [compared with 2025], while we’ve seen a slight decline in bookings to the USA, we’ve seen a significant uplift in bookings to east Asia and northern Europe,” he said.Melissa Elf, global chief operating officer of Flight Centre’s corporate wing, said that while bookings from Australian business travellers had so far remained “resilient”, the introduction of tariffs could see businesses look away from the US and to places such as “Asia and the Middle East”.“It’s a very different landscape today compared to what it was at the beginning of the year, and we are conscious that major changes that have occurred in the US, and tariffs that are being applied to Australian companies may see corporates prioritise business and trade with other nations,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last year, [the] mining, IT and education sectors led corporate travel to the USA, but this year, it’s being led by education, government and mining. Again, this just shows how different sectors will prioritise different nations for business, based on where the opportunity lies.”Tourism Economics also named Trump’s influenceas damaging the US as a destination.“Policies and pronouncements from the Trump administration have contributed to a growing wave of negative sentiment toward the US among potential international travellers,” it said in a briefing issued on Friday.“Heightened border security measures and visible immigration enforcement actions are amplifying concerns.”What Australians flying to the US need to know about phone and device searches at the borderRead moreWhile the decline in tourist arrivals in March was strongest from Canada, at more than 20%, and western Europe, with countries such as Germany recording an almost 30% drop – Oceania (of which Australia is the largest market) is part of the trend, the agency said.It predicts a 9.4% drop in all inbound international tourism over the course of 2025, but noted this could grow with further volatility from the Trump administration.“These sentiment shifts represent a backlash to trade policies and other pronouncements that target individual countries – including country leaders, national industries, and citizens – in ways that elicit strong responses,” an earlier April briefing said.“Trump administration shifts on Ukraine and longstanding alliances, and domestic issues – such as the treatment of certain categories of individuals – are also contributing to the sentiment shift, casting the US in a new, less favourable light for many potential travellers. Leisure travelers, as well as business event organizers and participants, are expected to shift away from the US in response.”But there may be one silver lining to the traveller reticence – Kavanagh says airline capacity between the US and Australia has increased in recent months, which likely means lower airfares.Air France and KLM are among European carriers to cut air fares to the USto fill seats on their planned capacities this year.Explore more on these topicsTransportTourism (Australia)Donald TrumpAustralian foreign policyAirline industryUS immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Will the major parties’ promises make a difference? | Brendan CoatesRead more“We can build 200,000 to 220,000 with the labour force we have at the moment, [but] getting to 250,000 is the point at which we need more skilled labour.”The association estimatedthere were close to 280,000 workers in key skilled occupations but a shortage of 80,000 tradespeople remained. Industry bodies have consistentlycalled for greater government supportto increase the workforce.Reardon said tradespeople were turning to other careers, school leavers were shunning building and skilled migrants were entering the workforce too slowly.The number of construction trades apprentices in training fell 3.7% in the year to September, a report from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research found.There were 10,000 fewer new starters annuallycompared to 2021, while a greater number of trainees were withdrawing from their courses.“The building industry still has an acute shortage of labour because we’re losing labour to the mining industry and other construction projects,” Reardon said.Almost a tenth (9.5%) of Australia’s workforce have their main job in the construction industry, but the median weekly earnings for construction workers are $1,598 – about $100 less than the median weekly earnings across all industries,according to the government.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Danish police confirmed that two US citizens were charged with common assault.A Copenhagen police spokesperson told multiple outlets: “The Copenhagen Police can confirm, that on March 31, two American citizens were arrested in Copenhagen, and on March 31 they were brought before the court charged with common assault.“They were sentenced to 10 days pre-trial detention. This verdict has since extended until April 24.”Ray has been released from a Danish prison but authorities will not allow him to return to the US, his family said on Monday. The status of the other student is unclear.“We are relieved that Owen has been released from a Danish prison following the unprovoked assault he and his friend suffered at the hands of an Uber driver on March 31,” a statement by Ray’s parents, Andy Ray and Sara Buchen-Ray, said.“However, we remain deeply concerned that Danish authorities have confiscated his passport and will not allow him to return to the United States – something we understand is unusual in Danish court proceedings.“The facts make clear that Owen is the victim in this case, and we urge Danish officials to allow him to return home to the United States without delay.”US citizen detained in Afghanistan by Taliban released to Qatari embassyRead moreThe US state department said it is aware of the situation and is providing the citizens with consular assistance. “The Department has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad,” it said.A spokesperson for Uber told outlets that the company “take reports of violence very seriously”. “Any additional questions about the investigation should be directed to the Danish police,” the statement added.The arrests took place amid heightenedpolitical tensionsbetween Denmark and the US over ownership of Greenland.

It said on Monday thatAntoni Gaudí, the Catalan architect behind Barcelona’s Sagrada Família basilica, had been put on the path to sainthood.The Vatican said ina statementthat Pope Francis had recognised Gaudí’s “heroic virtues” during the 88-year-old’s first official appointment afterweeks of illnesswith life-threatening pneumonia.View image in fullscreenGaudí devotees have called for him to be named a saint for more than three decadesPhotograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesNearly a century after Gaudí’s death, the declaration is one of the initial steps in the long and complex process towards sainthood. The architect behind several of Barcelona’s biggest tourist attractions will have to be beatified before he can pass to the last step of canonisation.Gaudí devoteeshave calledfor him to be named a saint for more than three decades, pointing to how the fantasy spires and intricate stonework of the Sagrada Família had convinced some to convert to Catholicism.“There areno serious obstacles,” the architect and then-president of the Gaudí Beatification Society, José Manuel Almuzara said in 2003.

The fee was colloquially referred to as “the coffee for the gravedigger”, implying that in exchange for the favour, an extra sum had to be paid.“People were forced to pay in cash for faster burials,” said the police. “During the course of the investigation, no fewer than 25 cases of illicit burials were documented.”Police found that the municipal gravedigger hindered an outside company brought in to manage the services, instead directing three mortuaries with whom he conspired to carry out burials, exhumations and the transfers of remains, in exchange for a percentage of the profit.Police are still investigating what became of the removed corpses.Cemeteries and funeral parlours are often controlled by the mafia in areas of Italy where those criminal organisations are entrenched.Two weeks ago, the former custodian of the cemetery of Tropea, in the southern Italian region of Calabria, was sentenced to five years in prison, with three years and six months handed to his son, for operating what reports called a “cemetery of horrors”.The pair, caught in the act by hidden cameras set up by police in the cemetery, were charged with conspiracy, grave violation, desecration of a corpse, illicit disposal of special cemetery waste, and embezzlement.The coffins were smashed with a pickaxe, the corpses stripped, and jewels removed with saws and hammers. A video seen by the Guardian shows bodies being disposed of in black plastic bags and thrown into rubbish bins or burned.A lack of tombs and spaces for urns in cemeteries has become a serious emergency, especially in southernItaly, where the coffins of the dead sometimes lie piled up in warehouses for years. The Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated the crisis.In 2021, in Caltanissetta, Sicily, authorities drew up a lottery to bury bodies in the few graves left free.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsItalyDeath and dyingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Much like Vladimir Putin, Orbán has sought to portray himself as a champion of traditional family values, ushering in policies that includeblocking same-sex couples from adopting childrenand barring any mention of LGBTQ+ issues in school education programmes.Before Monday’s vote, Momentum issued a call on social media for Hungarians to join it in a blockade of the country’s parliament, in the hope of keeping lawmakers from voting in the legislation. “Let’s collectively prevent them from leading us down the Putin road and depriving us of our freedom,” it said.On Monday, opposition politicians and other protesters attempted to block the entrance to a parliament parking garage, with some using zip ties to bind themselves together, and were physically removed by police.The constitutional amendment was approved almost a month after lawmakers fast-tracked a law that banned public events held by LGBTQ+ communities. Thousands of people have sincetaken to the streets,blocking bridges and major thoroughfares with chants of “democracy” and “assembly is a fundamental right” in weekly protests.0:45Smoke bombs ignited as Hungarian parliament passes law banning Pride events – video“This government isn’t just dismantling democracy brick by brick, it’s now going at it with a bulldozer,” Ákos Hadházy, an independent lawmaker who campaigns alongside Momentum, said at a recent rally,accordingto Bloomberg. “We are here because we need to act fast to get ahead and stop it.”Orbán and his government have said their aim is to protect children from what they describe as “sexual propaganda”, but analysts have pointed to forthcoming elections to argue that the country’s LGBTQ+ minority is being scapegoated by a government intent on mobilising its conservative base.Orbán, who haslong faced criticismfor weakening democratic institutions and gradually undermining the rule of law, is facing anunprecedented challengefrom a former member of the Fidesz party’s elite, Péter Magyar, before next year’s elections.As news of the Pride ban broke last month, 22 European embassies in Hungary, including those of the UK, France and Germany, issued a joint statement saying they were deeply concerned that the legislation would result in “restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly and the freedom of expression”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The right to gather peacefully is a fundamental right to be championed across the European Union. We stand with the LGBTQI community – in Hungary & in all member states.”The organisers of Budapest Pride, which regularly attracts tens of thousands of people, said they were determined to go ahead with this year’s march on 28 June. “This is not child protection, this is fascism,” they said last month.The amendment, the 15th to Hungary’s constitution since it was unilaterally authored and approved by the ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition in 2011, also seeks to reinforce Orbán over what he claims are foreign efforts to influence Hungary’s politics.In a recent speech laced with conspiracy theories, Orbán pledged to “eliminate the entire shadow army” of foreign-funded “politicians, judges, journalists, pseudo-NGOs and political activists”.Rights groups described the amendment as a step in this direction for Orbán, a self-described “illiberal” leader, because it allows for the suspension of Hungarian citizenship for up to 10 years for dual nationals deemed to pose a threat to public order or security. The suspensions would only apply to Hungarians who hold citizenship of another country that is not a member of the EU or European Economic Area.The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and the Háttér Society have urged the European Commission to launch a procedure against Hungary’s government, arguing that the recent changes breach EU law.The groups highlighted the “gravity and urgency of the consequences of the adopted changes” in a recent statement, noting that they would “force LGBTQ+ people completely out of the public eye”. The nationwide ban is believed to be the first of its kind in the EU’s recent history.The groups also said the amendment went further than violating the rights of LGBTQ+ people and those who supported them,describing itas a tool to further instil fear among those who voice dissent in the country. “The changes have overarching consequences that affect fundamental rights well beyond the issue of Pride,” they said.Explore more on these topicsHungaryEuropeLGBTQ+ rightsGendernewsShareReuse this content"

It accused his government of putting the lives of soldiers and the hostages at risk for his own political gain.Critics have alleged that Netanyahu’s decision to return to war in Gaza wasdriven by a need to appease the far-right parties in his coalition, who have threatened to bring down his government if he does not completely crush Hamas.“The war mainly serves political and personal interests and not security interests,” said the letter.The letter was first published and publicly signed last week by almost 1,000 reservists and retired officers from Israel’s air force, which has been at the forefront of the continued assault onGaza.It prompted a vehement response from Netanyahu, who said it was written by “an extreme fringe group that is once again trying to break Israeli society from within” and ordered the dismissal of all the active-duty reservists who had signed it.Several similar statements were successively made in support, including by reservists from Israel’s elite Unit 8200, the biggest military intelligence unit, and hundreds of reservist doctors.On Monday, another public letter signed by more than 1,500 former and current armoured corps soldiers and paratroopers with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), including two former IDF chiefs of staff, called for an immediate end to the war in Gaza.“We are soldiers who have served our country all our lives. We have driven tanks, commanded troops, and paid a heavy price. It is precisely this experience that pushes us today to call for a ceasefire,” said the letter, authored by Col Rami Matan, a former IDF deputy commander, adding: “Why do we continue to sacrifice human lives for unattainable objectives?”View image in fullscreenDrummers at the protest outside the west Jerusalem home of Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer.Photograph: Saeed Qaq/NurPhoto/Rex/ShutterstockIsrael and Hamas have been engaged in negotiations in Cairo, with the involvement of Qatar, Egypt and the US, who have been attempting to broker another ceasefire after the last one collapsed in March and Israel launched a wave of strikes.Reports emerged on Monday that Israel had proposed a deal to Hamas that would see 10 hostages released. According to Tikva Forum, a rightwing group advocating for the hostages, Netanyahu told the father of the hostage Eitan Mor on Sunday that the government was working on a deal that would bring home 10 captives, but gave no further details on the conditions Israel had put forward.A Hamas official who spoke to the Lebanese newspaper Al Mayadeen said Israel had proposed the return of 10 hostages in return for an initial 45-day ceasefire, when the Israeli government’s blockade on aid going into Gaza would be lifted and the IDF would withdraw from Gaza territory it had seized since March.According to the official, Israel and Hamas would also commit to negotiations for a second stage, which is where the previous ceasefire commitments had stalled and ultimately fallen apart. This would include discussions of a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the disarmament of Hamas.Speaking to AFP on Monday, Taher al-Nunu, a senior Hamas official, accused Israel of obstructing progress towards a ceasefire. He said Hamas was willing “to release all Israeli captives in exchange for a serious prisoner swap deal, an end to the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and the entry of humanitarian aid”.However, he made it clear that the disarmament of Hamas was not “up for negotiation”.On Sunday night, hundreds of people, including dozens of family members of former and current hostages, staged a protest outside the home of Ron Dermer, the minister Netanyahu has put in charge of the hostage negotiations, leading to five arrests.In recent days, hostage families have alleged that Dermer, who is one of Netanyahu’s closest advisers, has been delaying and obstructing negotiations in order to suit the government’s political agenda. The Netanyahu government has pushed back at the allegations, stating that it was doing everything to free the hostages.Doron Zektser, the father of the hostage Edan Alexander, addressed Dermer in a statement: “Come out, update us on the situation. That’s your responsibility. If you can’t do the job, resign. He doesn’t speak with the families. They’re rushing to war when it’s clear that only a deal will bring the hostages back.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warThe MossadHamasGazaIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The entire time they’ve done trial by media. My lawyers proactively wrote to the Bangladeshi authorities, they never responded.“I’m sure you’ll understand I can’t dignify this politically motivated smear campaign with any … comments. It’s a completely politically motivated smear campaign, trying to harass me. There is no evidence that I’ve done anything wrong.”According to Bangladeshi media reports, a judge issued the warrant for 53 people connected to Sheikh Hasina, Siddiq’s aunt, whostepped down and left the countryin August last year after a violent crackdown on protests.There is no formal extradition treaty between the UK and Bangladesh.A representative for Siddiq said there was “no basis at all for any charges to be made against her, and there is absolutely no truth in any allegation that she received a plot of land in Dhaka through illegal means”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some people told us they were scared to leave their accommodation, risking increased isolation, and others said they feared they’d be attacked walking down the street just because of the colour of their skin.”He added: “The climate of hostility has increased, especially on social media which played a key role in escalating tensions. Disinformation and racist rhetoric have surged, especially on platforms like X, with some of those who spoke to us reflecting they’d see hate within minutes of logging on to the website. More action needs to be taken by the UK government to stem the impact of disinformation and hate both online and offline.”The report also called for asylum seekers to have the right to work in any job if the Home Office has not processed their claim within six months, arguing that this would not only boost asylum seekers’ mental health but also increase tax revenue for the Treasury. The data is based oncalculations by the Institute of Economic and Social Research.According to the figures, allowing asylum seekers to work after six months would save the country £4.4bn in government expenditure, grow the economy by £1bn, increase tax revenue by £880m, reduce the mental health impacts of worklessness and destitution on asylum seekers, promote better integration, and reduce dependence on taxpayer support.The report warned that preventing asylum seekers from getting jobs was leading to “workless stagnation”. It echoes theLift The Bancampaign, a coalition of more than 300 charities, trades unions, businesses, faith groups and thinktanks, which have urged the government to allow asylum seekers to work in a broader range of industries.Under the current rules, only some asylum seekers who are qualified in shortage occupations can apply for jobs if their asylum claim has not been determined after a year. In practice this system bars many from working.Rowland added: “Giving asylum seekers the right to work is a no-brainer. Everyone – from asylum seekers, to businesses, to the government, to the NHS, to our communities – benefits when asylum seekers are given the ability to support themselves. The current system, which is both harmful and expensive, cannot continue as it is.”The foundation, which supports asylum seekers and refugees with their mental health, through programmes across the UK, also highlighted in the report the acute poverty faced by asylum seekers who sometimes have to make a choice between skipping meals or paying the bus fare for a vital appointment.Some felt the words “asylum seeker” stigmatised them. One child told researchers she hid the fact that she was an asylum seeker from her school friends for fear of being excluded by them if she told them about her immigration status.A Home Office spokesperson said: “While the wellbeing of those in the asylum system is important, we remain determined to continue cracking down on anyone working illegally in the UK, and we certainly have no intention of creating a fast-track process so that people who come to the UK outside the established work visa rules are simply allowed to ignore them.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthImmigration and asylumHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The fight for a share of straitened household budgets is led by Asda, which is struggling to hold on to its position as the UK’s third largest chain.Linda Ellett, the UK head of consumer, retail and leisure at KPMG, said the modest rate of sales growth as costs rise “means there are some retailers really struggling whilst others win, especially online”.Explore more on these topicsRetail industryConsumer spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

On 20 February, and then again on 14 March, she had a thoracotomy operation – a surgical procedure where the chest wall is opened.Upon the second surgery, her condition improved and the University College hospital at Westmoreland Street was planning to discharge her, the inquest heard. However, Davis went into cardiac arrest at 11.25pm on 23 March and was pronounced dead in the early hours of the morning on 24 March, after a failed resuscitation attempt.Wilcox said: “I am satisfied that the medical cause of death should be arrhythmic cardiac arrest and complications following left thoracotomies.“In my view, the stress of everything together has precipitated this arrhythmic cardiac arrest in a lady who was not known to have any previous arrhythmia problems.”According to Wilcox, Davis had achondroplasia, a bone growth disorder that results in dwarfism, which was “complicated by very severe spinal problems” requiring multiple surgeries from 2016.The coroner said: “In my view, if this compression hadn’t occurred, Ms Davis simply wouldn’t have been so unwell. She wouldn’t have needed two lots of major surgeries.”She commended the “excellent care” provided by the hospital, noting that it was “frankly heartbreaking” that the surgery itself was successful only for complications to arise and to cause her death.Upon her death last year, Samantha Davis wasdescribed by her husbandas “the greatest love of his life”. Speaking about his wife, he said: “She was a unique character, always seeing the sunny side of life. She had a wicked sense of humour and always laughed at my bad jokes.“Without Sammy, there would have been no Tenable quizshow, no Willow series. No Idiot Abroad series 3.”Warwick Davis said Samantha was his “most trusted confidante and an ardent supporter of everything I did in my career” and that having her by his side felt “like having a superpower”.He dedicated his Bafta film fellowship award to his wife during an emotional tribute at the ceremony in February.Additional reporting: PA MediaExplore more on these topicsUK newsCharitiesDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Economic security can no longer be an afterthought because some now investing in Britain are seeking more than profit from our nation – they are seeking power over our nation.”One Labour frontbencher added: “Serious supply-chain analysis, driven by security, is still lacking. We don’t do it enough or clearly enough and it should be the guiding analysis that drives our industrial strategy.”George Magnus, an associate at the China Centre at Oxford University, said: “We should be running the rule much more carefully over any inward investment coming from China.”The government has attempted to smooth over any friction with Beijing over what has happened at Scunthorpe in the last week.Downing Street on Monday said Jingye, the Beijing-based steelmaking conglomerate, had not “acted in good faith” after it emerged the company had been negotiating over a government bailout while also trying to sell raw supplies destined for the plant.View image in fullscreen‘Fiercely vigilant’: blast furnaces at British Steel’s Scunthorpe plant. Liam Byrne, the Labour MP who chairs the business select committee, said the UK must now be cautious over foreign investment into critical infrastructure.Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/ReutersThat revelation prompted the government to pass anemergency lawover the weekend to give ministers the power to interfere in how the company is run – a power they have now used to pay for the raw supplies in question.Two shipments of coal and iron ore will be unloaded from vessels docked at Immingham, 30 miles to the east of Scunthorpe, on Tuesday, with another ship making its way to the UK.Ministers say the shipments will help keep the site’s two blast furnaces running without cooling down so much they cannot be restarted. They have not ruled out however having to clean one of the furnaces using a process known as a “salamander tap”, which would take it temporarily out of operation and could make it difficult to restart.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, said during a visit to Scunthorpe on Monday: “We’ve got the raw materials, they’ve been paid for, and we’re confident that the furnaces will continue to fire.”Despite government anger over Jingye’s actions, however, both No 10 and the Treasury said they believed this to have been a one-off issue with a private company rather than a sign of the broader risks of Chinese infrastructure investment.A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “We’re not aware of any deliberate acts of sabotage. But as the business sector, and I think the industry minister, said over the weekend, in the talks that we were engaging with the Chinese owners, it became clear that they wanted to shut the blast furnaces.“Obviously this relates to a commercial Chinese company, rather than a state-owned company.”James Murray, the Treasury minister, echoed that message, telling Times Radio: “We are open to [Chinese] investment, whilst being also open-eyed about saying that when there’s foreign involvement in critical infrastructure, whatever country that comes from, we need to make sure there is a high level of scrutiny.”He added: “I think it’s important to make clear that the actions of Jingye, of one company, don’t speak to the actions of all Chinese companies.”The government has made a major push to secure Chinese investment in key parts of British infrastructure, with the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, both having made high-profile visits to China in recent months.Chinese investors already hold stakes in British water companies, airports and energy infrastructure, while the proposed nuclear power plant at Bradwell B in Essex is being developed in part by China General Nuclear Power.Douglas Alexander, the trade minister, has spent the last few days in China andHong Kong, though British officials would not say whether he discussed the situation at Scunthorpe.Downing Street said Alexander did raise the case of Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP who wasdenied entry to Hong Kong last week. But while Alexander expressed “deep concern” over the incident, the Hong Kong administration later put out a statement defending the decision, saying: “It is the duty of immigration officer to ask questions to ascertain that there is no doubt about the purpose of any visit.”Explore more on these topicsChinaForeign policyHong KongBritish SteelSteel industryInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

He intends to lodge objections to the plans.Mathrani is also sure that the royal family would be unhappy to hear what is being done in their name to a restaurant long regarded as the grand dame of British-Indian food.He said: “They believe in history, in living history, and that’s what this restaurant is. It’s not just a museum, and I think they would be disappointed that an institution bearing their name would be so heartless.”At lunchtime on Monday, diners waxed lyrical about the restaurant’s heritage and current menu, which includes classics such as patiala shahi raan en croute, a Welsh lamb shank slow-cooked for six hours before being wrapped in pastry and grilled in a tandoor.The same menu includes photos of its historical equivalents, which included wartime offerings of lobster mayonnaise, jugged hare and sherry trifle. While the fare has evolved and sought to keep pace with modern British-Indian cooking, celebrity guests have remained constant.One diner said: “It’s just a really lovely place and for as long as I can remember there’s always been a sort of excitement about it. It was a few years ago but I can remember coming here and the Prince of Wales was in another part of the restaurant. They had curtains drawn but there was a buzz.”Established in 1926 by Edward Palmer, the great-grandson of the first governor general of India’s private secretary and a north Indian Moghul princess, the restaurant was intended to “educate” Londoners about Indian food decades before the era of celebrity chefs. It was sold in 1934 to an MP, Sir William Steward, who made it a fashionable rendezvous among royalty and British elites returning from India.View image in fullscreenButlers and kitchen staff at Veeraswamy in 1927.Photograph: ShutterstockAfter a period of decline in the 1980s, it was bought by Mathrani and Namita Panjabi, who poured resources into recreating its past glories. In 2008, the restaurant catered for a function held by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace and it was invited back to launch the UK-India 2017 Year of Culture. In 2016, it was awarded a Michelin star.Nevertheless, modern commercial motivations are now a factor in its future. The crown estate, the royals’ ancient portfolio of land and property across England and Wales, wants to take back the restaurant because it plans to extend a ground-floor reception area for offices upstairs in the building that houses Veeraswamy. Knocking into the restaurants’s entrance area, where a uniformed usher greets visitors, would give an extra 11 sq metres.The crown estate said in a statement issued this week that it needed to carry out a comprehensive refurbishment of Victory House.“This includes a major upgrade to the offices and improving the entrance to make it more accessible,” it added. “Due to the limited options available in this listed building we need to remove the entrance to the restaurant, which means we will not be able to offer Veeraswamy an extension when their lease expires.”Explore more on these topicsRestaurantsHospitality industryFoodIndian food and drinkLondonReal estateMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

The attacker used a makeshift sharp weapon fashioned out of metal during the sustained attack, as well as cooking fat. One officer suffered third degree burns.After the incident, the government announced measures to increase safety in the facility, one of which was thebanning of some of the most dangerous offendersfrom the prison cooking area.Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the Prison Officers’ association (POA), said staff were furious, and many had been traumatised by the injuries their colleagues had suffered, with two still in hospital.He said inmates had access to meals in keeping with their dietary requirements, and should not have been allowed access to a kitchen where dangerous utensils were stored.Fairhurst said: “You are giving them the resources to fashion weapons and attack staff. Especially the ideological prisoners, who will not change.”The union had repeatedly called for stab vests for its members. One guard is said to have suffered five stab wounds to their torso, damage which the POA said could have been limited by the availability of vests.The Guardian understands that also housed in the unit wasAnjem Choudary,serving life imprisonment after being convicted in 2024 of directing a terrorist organisation, membership of a proscribed organisation, and encouraging support for a terrorist organisation.He is believed to have been in the prison gym at the time of the attack, and in 2016was convicted of supporting Islamic State.Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into the attacks, with the separation unit used to house extremist prisoners believed to pose a danger of radicalising others.Detectives have been able to speak to the three prison officers who were attacked, but only briefly to the two male ones who suffered the worst injuries and who as of Monday, were still in hospital. Their lives are not believed to be in danger, and the injured female prison officer has been released.Fairhurst said: “Staff are traumatised and angry. It has affected them as they were such horrific assaults on their colleagues.”One line of inquiry is whether the attacks were premeditated. Fairhurst said that until the weekend, Abedi had shown no signs of trouble, and that detectives were searching the jail for where the metal used to make the knife-like weapon came from, alongside any Islamist propaganda.After the attacks, the prison service suspended permission for inmates on separation units to access kitchens and the sharp equipment they contain. The Ministry of Justice, responsible for prisons in England and Wales, would not say where Abedi is located.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This avoids detectives being under time limits to complete vital stages of their investigation, and any risk their suspect poses is mitigated as he is already behind bars and is also isolated.Families of five of the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb – Megan Hurley, Eilidh Macleod, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Curry, and Kelly Brewster – wrote to the government describing their “absolute disbelief” at the attack, demanding Abedi be placed in permanent solitary confinement.The BBCreported the letter, which said: “He should not be allowed any privileges whatsoever while serving a sentence for the deaths of 22 innocent lives and the injuring of many more.“He should not have access to anything that he can weaponise, such as hot oil or items he can turn into blades.”Keir Starmer’s official spokesperson said: “The prime minister is appalled by the attack that we saw at the weekend, and his thoughts with the officers involved. It’s clear that something went terribly wrong in the management of this offender and the government has committed to carry out an investigation to urgently get answers.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said:“We’ve already taken immediate action to suspend access to kitchens in separation and close supervision centres. We will also launch a full independent review into how this attack was able to happen.”Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationTrade unionsUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Such inquiries need to be completed within 270 days after being announced.The administration ofDonald Trumphas started 232 investigations into imports of copper and lumber, and inquiries completed in the US president’s first term formed the basis for tariffs rolled out since his return to the White House in January on steel and aluminum and on the auto industry.The US began collecting 10% tariffs on imports on 5 April. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are exempt from those duties, but Trump has said they will face separate tariffs.Trump said on Sunday he would be announcing a tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility with some companies in the sector.Trump administration sued over tariffs in US international trade courtRead moreThe US relies heavily on chips imported from Taiwan, something then president Joe Biden sought to reverse by granting billions in Chips Act awards to lure chipmakers to expand production in the United States.The investigation announced on Monday will include both pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical ingredients as well as other derivative products, the notice showed.Drugmakers have argued that tariffs could increase the chance of shortages and reduce access for patients. Still, Trump has pushed for the fees, arguing that the US needs more drug manufacturing so it does not have to rely on other countries for its supply of medicines.Companies in the industry have lobbied Trump to phase in tariffs on imported pharmaceutical products in hopes of reducing the sting from the charges and to allow time to shift manufacturing.Large drugmakers have global manufacturing footprints, mainly in the US, Europe and Asia, and moving more production to the US involves a major commitment of resources and could take years.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationPharmaceuticals industryTrump tariffsDonald TrumpUS politicsUS economyLobbyingnewsShareReuse this content"

The vice-president ended the Ohio State football team’s visit to the White House by fumbling the team’s national championship trophy.After laudatory speeches by Donald Trump, Buckeyes coach Ryan Day and Vance on the South Lawn, the Vance – an Ohio State graduate – tried to lift the trophy. He didn’t appear to realize that the top of the trophy is detachable from its base. After a moment of struggle, the vice-president lost his grip on the two pieces. OSU running back TreVeyon Henderson, standing behind Vance, grabbed the football-shaped top of the trophy, but the base fell to the ground, forcing Vance to grasp around as it rolled away from him.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

However, during Trump’s first term several teams were not invited or made it clear they would not attend if they were. Those teams included theNBA’s Golden State Warriors, and the United States women’s national teamafter their victoryat the 2019 Women’s World Cup.Teams have been more willing to engage with the White House during Trump’s second term though.

The Silicon Six’s corporate income tax contributions are, in percentage terms, way below what sectors such as banking and energy are paying in many parts of the world.”Monaghan pointed to “aggressive tax practices” such as the contingency tax positions, while the companies also exerted “enormous political influence as well as economic power”, spending millions of dollars on lobbying governments.The report comes as the US tech companies’ influence has been highlighted by thepresence of their bossesincluding Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at Donald Trump’s second inauguration.A significant tax cutfor such companies has reportedly been at the heart of discussions with the UK in its attempts to secure lower tariffs on its products exported to the US.Monaghan said that much of the Silicon Six’s overseas revenue was subject to low-level rates of corporate income tax in the US via a tax break for foreign-derived intangible income. FTF said overseas sales were also subject to lower rates of income tax because of a combination of lower profit margins and booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions.Netflix had the lowest rate of tax actually paid compared with profit booked, at 14.7%, while Microsoft paid 20.4%. FTF said Amazon had the worst tax conduct based on the factors such as the total amount of tax paid and “obvious profit shifting” – such asbooking a sizeable portion of its UK incomein low-tax Luxembourg. However, Amazon’s corporate tax rate was 19.6%, well ahead of Netflix, Meta (15.4%) and Apple (18.4%).A spokesperson forAmazonsaid its UK retail revenues, associated expenses, profits and taxes were recorded in the UK, and reported and paid directly to HM Revenue and Customs.They said: “Governments write the tax laws and Amazon is doing the very thing these laws encourage companies to do – paying all taxes due while also investing billions in creating jobs and infrastructure. Since 2010, we have invested more than $1.2tn in the US and over €250bn [£215bn] in Europe. Coupled with low margins, this investment will naturally result in a lower cash tax rate, particularly when measured as a percentage of revenue.”A spokesperson forMetasaid: “We follow international and local tax rules, ensuring that we pay all taxes required in each of the countries where we operate.”ANetflixspokesperson said: “Governments determine tax rules and rates – and companies comply with them. Netflix complies with the relevant tax rules and regulations in every country in which we operate.”Microsoft,Alphabetand Apple were all approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsUS taxationTax avoidanceAmazonMetaAlphabetAppleMicrosoftnewsShareReuse this content"

It is also unconstitutional.”The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.Thepetition, submitted by his lawyers on Monday, argues that Mahdawi’s arrest and detention violates his first amendment rights, his statutory rights and due process rights.In the court documents, Mahdawi’s attorneys state that he is a lawful permanent resident of the US, currently on the path to naturalization, and has held a green card for the past 10 years.They assert that this case “concerns the government’s retaliatory and targeted detention and attempted removal of Mr Mahdawi for his constitutionally protected speech”.According to the court filing, Mahdawi was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank, where he lived until he moved to the US in 2014. He became a lawful permanent resident of the US in 2015.He is a student of Columbia University, with an expected graduation date of May 2025. Mahdawi plans to return to the school as he has been accepted into a master’s program at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, which will begin this fall, according to the court documents.As a student at Columbia, his lawyers say that he was “an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and an activist and organizer in student protests on Columbia’s campus until March of 2024, after which he took a step back and has not been involved in organizing”.On Monday morning, Mahdawi’s attorneys say he was arrested and detained by Department of Homeland Security agents, even though he is a lawful permanent resident, his lawyers wrote.His lawyers say in the filing that it appears as though Mahdawi is facing deportationunder the rarely invoked provision that the administrationhas recently used in other cases, such as in their efforts to deportMahmoud Khalil.The provision gives the secretary of state the right toremove individuals from the US if their presence isdeemed to pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”.On Monday afternoon the Vermont senators Bernie Sanders and Peter Welch, along with Vermont representative Becca Balint, issued a statement on the arrest.“Earlier today, Mohsen Mahdawi of White River Junction, Vermont, walked into an immigration office for what was supposed to be the final step in his citizenship process,” they said. “Instead, he was arrested and removed in handcuffs by plain-clothed, armed, individuals with their faces covered.“These individuals refused to provide any information as to where he was being taken or what would happen to him. This is immoral, inhumane, and illegal. Mr Mahdawi, a legal resident of the United States, must be afforded due process under the law and immediately released from detention.”In avideo being shared onlineof the arrest, Mahdawi is seen in handcuffs being walked out of a building and put into a car by officers.Mahdawi was profiled by Canary Mission, an online database that publishes the names and personal information of people that it considers to be anti-Israel or antisemitic. Last month, the group included Mahdawi in a list on their website titled “Uncovering Foreign Nationals”.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationColumbia UniversityVermontnewsShareReuse this content"

Addressing reporters at the White House, he continued to threaten new tariffs on pharmaceutical goods.As fears of a potential downturncontinue to mount, Kevin Hassett, the director of the US national economic council, pushed back against warnings that a recession could take hold this year. “100% not,” he told Fox Business.Leading tech stocks struggled for direction amid confusion over theTrump administration’s stance on key US imports including smartphones and semiconductors.While it emerged that such electronic goods and components were exempt from the sweeping tariffs imposed this month, Trump and his officials have signaled they may not be spared for long.“THE BEST DEFINITION OF INTELLIGENCE IS THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE FUTURE!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday, as firms around the world struggled to keep up with the latest developments, let alone judge what might happen next.Consumers are starting to feel the impact of the trade tensions. Sonyincreased the price of its PlayStation 5by 25% in some markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania, citing “a challenging economic environment” as the video game industry reels from the impact of Trump’s tariffs.China, meanwhile, has vowed to stand firm in the face of Trump’s tariffs.The world’s second-largest economy has diversified its trade away from the US in recent years, according to Lyu Daliang, a customs administration spokesperson, in commentsreported by state-owned agency Xinhua.Beijing has retaliated forcefully to Washington’s tariffs, with125% levieson US imports against the US’s total of 145% border taxes on goods moving the other way. The trade war has prompted turmoil on financial markets since Trump first revealed tariffs on every country in the world on 2 April. Since then he has partly retreated on the highest levies on most trading partners for at least 90 days, but has doubled down in his spat with China.Line graph shows markets in Germany, China, UK, Canada, US and Japan falling sharply after Trump announced his new tariffs policy on 2 April, and then rebounding in the days that followedThe White House offered further relief over the weekend with an exemption from the steepest tariffs forelectronics including smartphones, laptops and semiconductors. But Trump officials later appeared to walk that back with the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, saying such devices would be “included in the semiconductor tariffs which are coming in probably a month or two”.Trump said on Sunday night on Truth Social that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” highlighting that smartphones were still subject to 20% levies and suggesting they could still rise higher.However, investors on Monday appeared unconvinced by Trump’s attempts to play down the retreat. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.2% while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose by 2.2% and the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges climbed by 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It filed the case in 2020 duringDonald Trump’s first term.The FTC seeks to force Meta to restructure or sell parts of its business including Instagram and WhatsApp. The trial poses the first major test for the FTC under the secondTrump administration. The agency began the investigation that led to the trial during Trump’s first term.Legal Defense Fund exits Meta civil rights advisory group over DEI changesRead moreJennifer Newstead, Meta’s chief legal officer, called the case weak and a deterrent to tech investment in a blogpost on Sunday.“It’s absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the Administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok,” she wrote.The case poses an existential threat to Meta, which by some estimates earns about half of its US advertising revenue from Instagram, while also giving the public its first real measure of how strongly the newTrump administrationwill follow up on its promises to take on big tech.LosingInstagramwould be a devastating blow to Meta, said Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at market research firm Emarketer.“It would also severely damage its future user and revenue growth prospects,” Enberg said. “Instagram is now Meta’s biggest money maker in the US, its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company’s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack forFacebookon the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time.”Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating $1m to Trump’s inauguration. Meta’s CEO,Mark Zuckerberg, has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks. Zuckerberg has also purchased a new $23m mansion in DC that would “allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership”, a company spokesperson toldPolitico. The billionaire’s companydonated $1mto Trump’s inaugural committee and has unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the president to settle the case against Meta duringmeetings at the White House.“The Trump-Vance FTC could not be more ready for this trial,” said an FTC spokesperson, Joe Simonson, adding: “We are blessed with some of the most hardworking and intelligent lawyers in the country who are working around the clock.”Zuckerberg is expected to testify at the trial, where he will face questioning about emails in which he proposed acquiring the photo-sharing app Instagram as a way to neutralize a potential Facebook competitor and expressed worry that the encrypted messaging serviceWhatsAppcould grow into a social network.Meta has argued in court papers that its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 have benefited users, and that Zuckerberg’s past statements are no longer relevant amid fierce competition from ByteDance’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube and Apple’s messaging app.How users spend time on social media, and whether they consider the services interchangeable, will be core to the case. Meta will point to an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook duringTikTok’s brief shutdownin the United States in January as evidence of competition, according to court records.The FTC claims Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap’s Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued.The trial could have far-reaching consequences for the social media industry, according to Forrester’s vice-president of research, Mike Proulx.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotion“The ramifications of this trial coupled with TikTok’s future in limbo potentially puts the very core of the social media market at play,” said Proulx. “No longer would Meta be its centre of gravity. We haven’t seen anything like this since around 2006-2011 – social media’s earliest days. We’d likely see a renaissance of social media startups looking to grab a piece of new social media world order.”The US district judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that while the FTC has enough evidence to move forward, the agency “faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial”.The formerFTC chair Lina Khan saidthat Meta resorted to a “buy-or-bury scheme” when it was acquiring players such as Instagram and WhatsApp – if the company could not beat a competitor, it would either acquire the firm or cut off access to Facebook’s network and features. The case was about “free and fair trade”, Khan said in an NBC interview.“There’s no expiration date when it comes to the illegality of the transaction,” Khan said. “I think there is a way in which the entire social networking ecosystem looks different today because Facebook was permitted to go out and make these acquisitions.”Gerry Adams considers suing Meta over alleged use of his books to train AIRead moreThe trial is scheduled to stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to prove at a second trial that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition.Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta’s bottom line.While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate $37.13bn this year, a little over half of Meta’s US ad revenue.WhatsApp to date has contributed only a sliver to Meta’s total revenue, but it is the company’s biggest app in terms of daily users and ramping up efforts to earn money off tools including chatbots. Zuckerberg has said such “business messaging” services are likely to drive the company’s next wave of growth.Explore more on these topicsMetaInstagramWhatsAppSocial mediaFacebookLaw (US)Mark ZuckerbergnewsShareReuse this content"

Regulators have largely focused on bisphenol A (BPA), which is banned in Europe for food uses because it is so toxic. Many companies have phased out BPA’s use and food companies often advertise when their packaging is BPA free.But recent research has found BPS, the alternative largely used in place of BPA, to bejust as toxic. It’s linked to hormone disruption, cognitive damage, decreased sperm count, breast cancer and other health issues.Previous research has found it can be absorbed by the skin, and CEH’s new study shows how high the risk is just for brief exposures while holding a receipt. The findings are particularly concerning for cashiers and people working in retail who may handle many receipts throughout the day.The CEH also noted that people in restaurants often hold receipts for a long period of time while looking at a bill or waiting for service.The chemicals are added as a coating to thermal paper to help ink develop. Some alternatives exist, but many are also toxic, and the non-profit is urging companies to use something safe to avoid “playing Whac-a-Mole” with dangerous chemicals, said Kizzy Charles-Guzman, the CEH’s executive director.

The US president also announced plans to excludesome electronic productsfrom steep reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods.Solomon said he was “encouraged by the US administration’s recent actions to pursue a more gradual policy process that allows for considered negotiations with many countries” but warned markets would continue to be volatile given that “how policy will evolve is still unknown”.The banking boss tried to strike a diplomatic tone, saying that the “administration’s focus on trade barriers and strengthening the US competitive position is commendable”. However, he noted the US has been a beneficiary of global trade arrangements. “Few … benefited more from the post-second world war economic and financial order than the United States.”“This doesn’t mean meaningful reform in certain areas is not warranted,” Solomon added.His comments came asGoldman Sachsreported its best-ever quarter for equities trading, as the bank benefited from market turmoil triggered by Trump’s return to the Oval Office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It helped push pre-tax profits up 8% in the first quarter to $5.6bn, a period that did not include the turmoil of Trump’s tariffs.But prolonged volatility and uncertainty over the tariff fallout could dampen appetite for loans and deal-making, and delay stock market listings, in moves that could ultimately hit revenues for banks such as Goldman Sachs.“So far, the business is performing very well and clients are very active,” Solomon said. “My guess is, over time, this level of uncertainty will come down.”Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsTariffsGoldman SachsDonald TrumpBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

There will be no price change for the standard PS5, which comes with a disk drive.The company cited “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates” behind its decision to increase the retail price of the PS5 in some markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania.In Australia, the standard PS5 will rise to A$829.95, while the digital edition will increase to A$749.95. In New Zealand, the standard console will increase to NZ$949.95, and the digital to NZ$859.95..The technology industry has been grappling with the possible impact of President Trump’s tariffs on its supply chains. Rival Japanese game developer Nintendo unveiled its new handheld console, the Switch 2, the day before Trump launched his barrage of “reciprocal” tariffs on foreign goods on 2 April. A few days later, the company postponed preorders of the device in the US, as it said it would need to assess the potential effect of tariffs.Japan was hit with a 24% tariff on its exports to the US on Trump’s “liberation day” on 2 April. Like most of Trump’s new tariffs, they have been paused for 90 days. However, the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said on Monday that his country did not plan to make big concessions in negotiations with the US and that it would not rush to reach a deal. Talks between the two governments are due this week.Companies such as Apple, whose products are largely assembled in China, are also bracing for higher costs. Analysts at the investment bank UBS have warned that the price of an iPhone 16 Max, with 256GB of storage,could rise 79% from $1,199 (£915) to about $2,150 (£1,600), based on a total tariff of 145%.While there is still a great deal of uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy, Japanese sharesrose on Mondayafter the US said it would pause levies on some electronics, including smartphones. Tokyo’s index of blue chip stocks, the Nikkei 225, closed up 1%.However, US officials said on Sunday that thepause on smartphones, laptops and other electronic products from import tariffs on China will be short-lived, with Trump warning on Sunday that no one was “getting off the hook”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, only two – Bess and Anne – are still in operation, and even those are faced with closure unless they can find raw materials to keep going.British Steel’s Chinese owners, Jingye, had planned to turn off another as soon as on Monday – using a process called a salamander tap – ahead of stopping all operations within weeks,with 2,700 jobs at risk.However, after taking control of the steelworks viaemergency legislation on Saturday, the government has directed British Steel to reverse course and do everything it can to keep production going.A line graph showing the decline of UK steel compared with all goods and services and manufacturing since 1990Why must blast furnaces be kept hot?Steel is made from iron ore. The problem is removing the oxygen tightly bound to the useful iron. The blast furnace’s innovation – a key contribution from Britain to the Industrial Revolution – was using coal and temperatures above 1,000C to reduce the iron, which is drawn out constantly as a liquid from the bottom of the blast furnace. (The oxygen is – unfortunately for the climate – turned intocarbon dioxide and vented into the air.)Blast furnaces are essentially 100-metre towers with an opening at the top for iron ore and coal, and a tap on the bottom to let out molten iron. They run continuously – all through Christmas, pandemics or financial crises – so letting them cool by too much would waste energy. However, the bigger problem comes if the metal solidifies. Then the risk is an immovable lump of iron and other leftovers known as slag, which blocks the bottom, leaving the furnace beyond repair.View image in fullscreenThe blast furnaces at the Scunthorpe plant.Photograph: Guy Bell/ShutterstockSo what exactly is a salamander tap?A salamander is a lizard-like amphibian, but for thousands of years in myth the creature was reputed to live in fire. The steel industry adopted the metaphor, using the word salamander to describe the remainders that sit at the very bottom of the furnace.A salamander tap, then, is the process of drilling a hole in the bottom of the blast furnace to let out, or tap, that molten metal and slag. That process means that the blast furnace could in future be restarted.Salamander taps are not unusual for blast furnaces. Over the decades in which they tend to operate, even the toughest materials lining the furnace break down and require replacement. That is possible only when the furnace has cooled, so tapping is required.Why are British Steel’s management keen to avoid a salamander tap?Working with molten metal is always dangerous, but technology such as remotely controlled drills has reduced the risk to life. However, costs can run into the millions of pounds, and the process requires a lot of preparation. It might be worthwhile for a blast furnace that will be restarted, but that calculation changes when a furnace is coming to the end of its life, as at Scunthorpe.Going down to a single blast furnace would be likely to deepen losses at Scunthorpe: British Steel would be left with most of the costs, but with half the output. For a company alreadylosing hundreds of millions of pounds, that would make recovery even harder.Does keeping the blast furnaces going save Scunthorpe in the long term?No. Anne and Bess are still thought to be in pretty bad shape after decades of under-investment under several owners. All blast furnaces wear out, but the consensus is that both the remaining furnaces at Scunthorpe are near the end of their lives.However, the government wants to keep them going untilcleaner electric arc furnaces can be built as a replacement. That would preserve jobs for at least a couple of years and retain British Steel’s customers – but building replacements could cost more than £1bn, which has not yet been committed.Explore more on these topicsBritish SteelSteel industryLincolnshireEnglandexplainersShareReuse this content"

Justin Rose will feel it most. Rose, the antagonist in Rory’s story, scored 65, 71, 75, 66 – the last of them, he said, “a bogey away from being the greatest round I’ve ever played”.The second shots in the playoff summed it up. Rose’s was pretty near perfect in the circumstances and landed 15 feet from the pin. McIlroy’s landed just beyond it, caught the slope, rolled back down and around, past Rose’s ball and finished up 5ft from the cup. Sometimes good just isn’t good enough. “Yeah, it hurts,” Rose said. “What are you going to do about it, though?”‘Welcome to the club’: Woods leads salutes to McIlroy’s Masters win and grand slamRead moreHe was the first to hug McIlroy close in the moments after he had made the winning putt. “Listen,” he told him, “I was glad I was here on this green to witness you win the career grand slam.”Rose has now written himself into the story of the tournament, it will be impossible to tell the history of the Masters without mentioning him. He has finished runner-up three times,losing two playoffs. Both times, he was second-best to two of the most popular Masters champions,Sergio García, who won his first majorafter 21 years of trying here, in 2017, and now McIlroy, who completed the career grand slam.Any other year, the European fans would have been thrilled when Rose holed that 20ft putt on 18 to tie the lead, but not this one. Rose understood. “We saw part of history today,” he said. “It’s a momentous day in golf.”Rose made a little of it. He is the first to have led the field through the first two days of competition on three occasions and is in the extraordinary position of having been top of the Masters leaderboard after 18, 36, 54, and 72 holes, twice, without winning it.View image in fullscreenJustin Rose has twice lost in a playoff at the Masters.Photograph: David J Phillip/APHe is 44 now, and playing as well as ever, but at that age things change quickly.

I took a moment just soaking that in. That was a nice moment because it was still what might be, what could be. One day, I won’t be competing this way at this tournament. So for now, the hard work is worth it.”McIlroy said: “He’s a great champion. He has displayed so much grace throughout his career. I remember watching the playoff in ’17 when he went up against Sergio and that didn’t quite go his way, either. But he’s had a phenomenal record around here and I feel for him because he’s been so close, and he’s a good friend, and …”McIlroy knowsthe disappointment better than mostand stopped to swallow a lump in his throat. “Yeah, hopefully he has a few more opportunities.”Their friendship was forged through all the years of playing together in theRyder Cup. It was conspicuous that as well as Rose, a couple of other Europeans, Tommy Fleetwood and Shane Lowry, were among the first to congratulate McIlroy. Even in the thick of all this, the tournament at Bethpage in September was in the back of McIlroy’s mind.“Selfishly, I was happy it was another European in the playoff,” he said. “We’re on a good run at the minute, Ryder Cup year and all that.”It had not been quite clear whether Rose was going to make the team this year, but there is no doubt about it now.He will be ready.“What do you choose to dwell on? There’s no point in being too despondent about it. You have to look at all the good stuff that got me into this situation. You can’t skip through a career without a little bit of heartache. It’s not going to happen.“If you’re willing to lift the big championships, you’ve to put yourself on the line. You have to risk feeling this way to get the reverse.”If you can’t be a great winner, you can still be a good loser.Explore more on these topicsThe MastersJustin RoseRory McIlroyRyder CupGolfPGA TourEuropean TourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But the team principal, ­Christian Horner, admitted there will be no quick fix.Horner conceded the team have problems that need to be addressed as soon as possible, but he said: “This race has exposed some pitfalls that are obviously very clear that we need to get on top of very quickly. Ultimately you can mask it a little through setup and we were able to achieve that last weekend in Suzuka. We understand where the issues are, it’s introducing the solutions that obviously take a little more time.”Lando Norris left searching for answers after disappointing Bahrain GPRead moreThe technical director, Pierre Waché, the motorsport adviser, ­Helmut Marko, and the chief engineer, Paul Monaghan, convened along with Horner to address the problems that have beset them and given Verstappen a mountain to climb in his title defence.Marko described the performance as “very alarming” and told German TV “the concern is great”. Verstappen, who said “everything went wrong that could go wrong”, could even consider his future at another team. Marko had previously made a point of emphasising that the Dutchman has a ­performance-related escape clause in his contract. Sky’s Ted Kravitz reported witnessing Verstappen’s manager, Raymond Vermeulen, angrily confronting Marko in the team’s garage after the race on Sunday.Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton and the Ferrari team principal, Fred ­Vasseur, believe they are making positive steps to improve this season. They both viewed Hamilton’s effort as a better performance, with both parties becoming better attuned to one another. Hamilton finished fifth at the Sakhir circuit in a racewon in dominant style by McLaren’s Oscar Piastri. It was the British driver’s best grand prix result with theScuderiasince joining this year.Charles Leclerc, Hamilton’s teammate, was fourth but, while theFerrariremained off the pace of McLaren and Mercedes, it was an improvement after a slow start to the season. ­Hamilton suggested he was ­becoming accustomed to the new team and car after 12 years with Mercedes.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton (centre) said he ‘learned a lot’ from his performance in Bahrain.Photograph: Eric Alonso/DPPI/Shutterstock“I think I’ve figured out how the car likes to drive so, if I apply that next week, if I can qualify better, I’ll have a much better ­weekend,” he said. “Finally we were in a spot and my driving style seemed to be working in that moment and so I learned a lot this weekend, probably more than all the other weekends.”Similarly, Vasseur said that their working partnership was progressing positively and he expected both team and driver to improve further. “You won’t replace 12 years of collaboration in two weeks or two races,” he said. “We need to improve but this is true for everybody in the paddock.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s good to have Lewis with this ­mindset: ‘I have to improve myself, and to adapt myself to the car.’ We will adapt the car to Lewis but he also has to make a step.”Vasseur has dealt with similar openings to the last two seasons, wielding calm control as the team bring the car up to pace, adapting to the misstep of upgrade setbacks mid-season last year and managing to repeatedly finish with a race winner. After Bahrain he remained convinced the team and Hamilton would do the same again.“In terms of management we have to take it a bit easy, to calm down, we have ups and downs as everybody. The issue is probably that the ups for us are a bit higher and the downs are a bit lower,” he said. “It means if we want to keep a consistent approach, and we did it very well the last two years, we have to stay calm, try to improve by hundredths of a second.

The vice-president ended the Ohio State football team’s visit to the White House by fumbling the team’s national championship trophy.After laudatory speeches by Donald Trump, Buckeyes coach Ryan Day and Vance on the South Lawn, the Vance – an Ohio State graduate – tried to lift the trophy. He didn’t appear to realize that the top of the trophy is detachable from its base. After a moment of struggle, the vice-president lost his grip on the two pieces. OSU running back TreVeyon Henderson, standing behind Vance, grabbed the football-shaped top of the trophy, but the base fell to the ground, forcing Vance to grasp around as it rolled away from him.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted on embed.bsky.app. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as the provider may be using cookies and other technologies.

However, during Trump’s first term several teams were not invited or made it clear they would not attend if they were. Those teams included theNBA’s Golden State Warriors, and the United States women’s national teamafter their victoryat the 2019 Women’s World Cup.Teams have been more willing to engage with the White House during Trump’s second term though.

Change is needed.”The move was unsurprising after the Suns missed the postseason, despite the presence of All-Stars such as Kevin Durant, Devin Booker and Bradley Beal. The Suns lost nine of their last 10 games to slump to a 36-46 record, meaning they finished 11th in the Western Conference, three wins short of a place in the play-in tournament. That snapped a four-season run of postseason appearances for Phoenix, including a run to theNBAfinals in 2020-21, when they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks. The Bucks that season were coached by Budenholzer.Nuggets announce shock firing of Malone less than two years after NBA titleRead moreBudenholzer was hired in May, replacing Frank Vogel, who also had a one-year tenure that ended in disappointment. It was hoped that Budenholzer – an Arizona native – could finally bring a championship to the desert. He didn’t come close.The season started with optimism after the Suns jumped to an 8-1 record, but Durant went down with a calf strain that knocked the team into a tailspin. Even after the 15-time All-Star returned to the lineup a few weeks later, Phoenix were unable to recapture their early momentum.Budenholzer couldn’t seem to settle on a regular playing rotation with rookies Ryan Dunn and Oso Ighodaro playing big minutes one night before being benched the next. Veteran center Jusuf Nurkic had an awful start to the season – and complained about a lack of communication with Budenholzer – before being traded to the Charlotte Hornets.Booker and Durant stayed relatively healthy for most of the season, but Beal had constant injury issues and missed more than 20 games in the regular season for a sixth straight year. The Suns tried to retool at the trade deadline, but Beal’s no-trade clause and the team’s salary cap status above the second apron made making any major moves difficult.Budenholzer’s departure signifies major upcoming roster upheaval for a team who have underachieved for three straight seasons. Owner Mat Ishbia has deep pockets and a desire to win, but almost every move he has made since taking over the team in February 2023 has backfired.Budenholzer has a 520-363 career record over 11 NBA seasons with the Hawks, Bucks and Suns.Budenholzer’s departure comes a week after the Denver Nuggetsfired their coach, Michael Malone.Explore more on these topicsPhoenix SunsNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The former Arsenal striker died aged 54 at Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI) last year.Campbell was said to be fit and well until around January 2024, when he was first admitted to MRI for seven weeks.An inquestin Manchester was told that tests showed he had severe heart and kidney failure but following treatment, including dialysis, he was deemed healthy enough to be discharged. Campbell lost weight during his hospital stay from 124kg to 98kg but it had plummeted to just 59kg when he was readmitted two months later on 17 May.Kevin Campbell, legend of the early Premier League, mixed goals with versatilityRead moreThe area coroner for Manchester, Zak Golombek, said Campbell was “very unwell” at that stage and medics felt there was some continuation of the heart and kidney failure, with signs of an infection of unknown cause. His condition continued to deteriorate as further investigations and tests in early June confirmed a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Medical treatment then continued until his death from multi-organ failure.An internal investigation by the hospital accepted the infection – caused by bacteria entering the blood and travelling to the heart – could have been diagnosed earlier and that “more curiosity” should have been shown by clinicians over Campbell’s significant weight loss.But the inquest was also told that he would “almost certainly” not been been fit enough to undertake “high risk” open-heart surgery if the infection had been detected earlier during his final admission. Recording a conclusion of death by natural causes, Golombek said: “Kevin died from a naturally occurring illness which very sadly on 15 June reached its natural end.”Campbellscored 59 goals in 228 games for Arsenaland, alongside the 1990-91 league title, also won the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners’ Cup with the club. He also played for Nottingham Forest, Trabzonspor, Everton, West Brom and Cardiff.Explore more on these topicsFootballArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The battle for European places is some way off being decided. Thanks to an early goal and a dogged defensive display that went against type, Bournemouth have relaunched their candidacy.Afterransacking champions-elect Liverpool, inconsistencies have stopped Marco Silva’s Fulham being a true contender for the top five. Victory in Dorset could have placed them in the Justin Rose, striking-distance position. Instead,Bournemouth leapfroggedthe Londoners into eighth.Bournemouth v Fulham: Premier League – liveRead moreFollowing a first league win in seven, Andoni Iraola’s team have six games remaining to rescue previously fading dreams of continental football for the first time in club history. “I think we needed this performance, defending our own box well, the clearances, the blocks, the basics, the set plays,” said Iraola. “This win comes in the perfect moment for us.”During recent disappointments,Bournemouthfans have had to cope with talk of their heroes being sold on elsewhere. Those getting their kicks from transfer tattle will know Dean Huijsen is linked to just about everyone, Real Madrid included. On his 20th birthday, the lofty, assured central defender and keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga led a rearguard effort that followed Antoine Semenyo’s eventually decisive, opening-seconds goal.If excitable Liverpool fans have already pencilled Milos Kerkez into Andy Robertson’s left-back position they will be enthused by the Hungarian’s solidity in defence and frequent launching of attacks. Another mooted contender for the Liverpool No 3 shirt in Fulham’s Antonee Robinson meanwhile blotted his scouting file with the mistake that set up Alex Scott’s run and Semenyo’s finish after 52 seconds.Such incision reminded what made Iraola’s team such appointment viewing during their winter purple patch, and also why the football economy can be so cruel in so quickly separating talented teammates. “We had to defend as a unit and stick together,” said Semenyo.“We made it difficult for ourselves at the start of the game,” said a grumpy Silva. “We started really badly, we have to take the responsibility for that as we need to start the game with the right intensity, quality and decision-making necessary at this level.”Bournemouth might have been three clear by half-time, Evanilson missing two good chances, including cracking the crossbar. Chance creation is rarely problematic for Bournemouth, execution has been a serious issue during a winless run stretching back to 15 February. Another early second-half chance flew by when Tyler Adams poked a shot that Bernd Leno saved instinctively with his trailing leg.View image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo drills home the winning goal for Bournemouth.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersSilva had seen enough, making three quick changes, sending on Tom Cairney, Raúl Jiménez and Adama Traoré. Here, confusion reigned. Ryan Sessegnon left the field, only to be ordered by Silva to return. Instead, the fourth official, Tim Robinson, ruled that with number called and Sessegnon having stepped off, he could not return. Sasa Lukic had been the intended departure, it became clear afterwards. The source of farce, it was also revealed, had been communication breakdowns between manager and assistants.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The fourth official was confused throughout the game, in all circumstances.”Alex Iwobi, match-winner against Liverpool but quiet here, belatedly arrived in the contest when testing Arrizabalaga from 25 yards. The Chelsea loanee was proving equal to the challenge. On came Emile Smith Rowe, a discarded jewel Silva is yet to polish, to play off Jiménez but Huijsen used all his height and guile to marshal the resistance.“I believe in my abilities and try my best for the team,” said the birthday boy. “We play high-press football, we are fearless in that sense, I am so happy we could win.”During brief Bournemouth respite, Evanilson claimed a penalty but Leno had won the ball before contact was made. Soon enough, Shaun Cooper, Iraola’s set-piece specialist, was heard calling plays when Fulham won a series of late corners. Time added on was lengthy after that substitution confusion but, with Arrizabalaga and Huijsen climbing highest and bravest, a successful rearguard effort confirmed that Bournemouth can do things the hard way.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBournemouthFulhammatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As a result the visitors kept coughing it up in dangerous positions, and this was where the game was won. None of the home side’s goals involved them crossing the halfway line, and the amount of time they spent in possession in the buildup to each of them was, in order of them being scored, eight seconds (with four players touching the ball), nine seconds (also four players), five seconds (one player) and three seconds (two players). More than a fifth of their total ball recoveries, 12 of them in all, took place in their attacking third, four of which led to goals; the equivalent figures for the visitors were two, and 4.3%.Simon BurntonMatch report:Newcastle 4-1 Manchester United2Amass in difficult introduction on full debutIf their defeat in Newcastle is to be remembered at all at Old Trafford (and most will hope it isn’t) it will probably be as another notable marker in the continued emergence of Harry Amass. The 18-year-old’s league debut against Leicester last month was hailed on United’s social media as “a special moment for the academy graduate” (a bit rum, given that he spent seven years in someone else’s academy – Watford’s – and just one and a bit in their own) and he officially becomes the 253rd player to emerge from their youth system and start a league game. This, though, was a difficult introduction, against high-quality opponents and in a wildly underperforming team. He is likely to regret his decision to go to ground in the moments before Newcastle’s second goal: he slid harmlessly into touch as the ball was whipped behind him by Jacob Murphy, through approximately the space he would have occupied had he stayed on his feet, for Harvey Barnes to score. After a busy first half, in the second Amass attempted neither any passes nor any tackles, and made no interceptions, in the 10 minutes before he was taken off.SBView image in fullscreenHarry Amass made his first Premier League start for Manchester United.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty Images3Potter facing pressure despite mid-season entryJudge him when he has a pre-season. Judge him when he doesn’t have the injuries West Ham have had this season. Judge him when he’s been able to bring in his own signings. Judge him when he’s been able to dispel the fug of negativity left by Julen Lopetegui. There are many reasons not to get too worked up about Graham Potter’s first three months as West Ham manager. But equally he has won just three of 13 games in all competitions. They’ve slipped to fourth-bottom in the league and he’s averaging 1.00 points per game, which is 0.15 per game less than Lopetegui did this season. With six games to go, the gap to third-bottom is 14, so relegation is not a threat and, with two of the sides below them plus Tottenham still to come, there are opportunities to improve that record. But unless there is a dramatic improvement over the next month, Potter will start next season under significant pressure.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Liverpool 2-1 West Ham4Pereira has Wolves aiming higherFirst the points, then the pints. Vítor Pereira has enjoyed mingling with Wolves supporters in local watering holes and his mantra is working, even if another encouraging performance was lost in Tottenham’s malaise. Pereira could be forgiven for thinking towards next season given Wolves are 14 points above the relegation zone but asked whether his team are safe, his response was telling. “If I start to speak about being safe, I’m not ambitious, I don’t show my ambition,” he said. “I didn’t come to thePremier Leaguejust to work to avoid relegation.” Pereira, who replaced Gary O’Neil in December, has won half of his 16 league matches in charge and on Sunday will take a team brimming with belief to Manchester United. January signings Marshall Munetsi and Emmanuel Agbadou again impressed against Spurs, while Jørgen Strand Larsen, the focal point they long craved, has five goals in his past four appearances. Wolves fans will wonder where Pereira can take them.Ben FisherMatch report:Wolves 4-2 TottenhamView image in fullscreenMatheus Cunha celebrates his goal in Wolves’ 4-2 win over Tottenham.Photograph: Jacob King/PA5Sancho needs to show consistencyIt is probably too soon to suggest that Jadon Sancho has turned a corner. The winger has been disappointing since Christmas and it remains to be seen if Chelsea decide to sign him on a permanent basis. Sancho’s loan deal contains an obligation to buy but there is also an option for Chelsea to pay a financial penalty and send him back to Manchester United. What to do? Sancho has shown some encouraging flashes in his past two appearances. He picked up two assists against Legia Warsaw last week and scored a stunning equaliser after coming off the bench during Chelsea’s 2-2 draw with Ipswich. The level of the opposition has to be taken into account, though. Sancho’s goals have come against Ipswich,Southamptonand Tottenham this season. He has to produce on a more consistent basis. Chelsea need him to be even more decisive if they are to qualify for the Champions League.Jacob SteinbergMatch report:Chelsea 2-2 Ipswich6Arteta in Partey politics before Real testManagers do not like the leaking of team news. Just look at howAnge Postecoglou feels at Tottenhamabout the mole in his camp. But Mikel Arteta takes things to another level. The Arsenal manager said he withdrew Thomas Partey against Brentford because the midfielder had “felt something” – but he steadfastly refused to say what it was. Would Partey be OK for Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday? Arteta did not know. At around the same time, Partey spoke to reporters in the mixed zone. His right foot was slightly bandaged but there was no sign of a limp nor any questions about the problem. Suffice to say he is expected to be fine. Madrid will not be guessing about Gabriel Martinelli, who came through what he described as a potentially leg-breaking challenge from Christian Nørgaard unscathed. “He accepted my apology and shook my hand,” Nørgaard said.David Hytnerskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You cannot perform if you are injured. The players we have, they can play every three days, four days, or they cannot. Then we build a squad for next season.” A left-back is a priority. “Obviously. Nico [O’Reilly] is helping us but he is not a left-back. I played with Alex Zinchenko at left-back, Fabian Delph. We have found solutions.” Guardiola also explained why Ederson came off after 71 minutes against Crystal Palace. “He had [previously] a few muscular problems. When he passed to Gündogan he had the same feeling.”Jamie JacksonMatch report:Manchester City 5-2 Crystal Palace8Hürzeler refuses to slam Dunk for errorFabian Hürzeler defended Lewis Dunk after the Brighton captain was partly responsible for Stephy Mavididi’s strike that finally ended Leicester’s eight-match goal drought. “I will never point Lewis out and say he’s the reason why we are not winning the game,” said Hürzeler. “That’s a fact, he’s my skipper, he’s a legend for the club and therefore he will try everything to bounce back, like the whole team.” But there is no hiding from the fact that Dunk looks a shadow of his former self at the moment as the 33-year-old struggled to keep up with Leicester’s attackers. Adam Webster’s injury and the suspension of Jan Paul van Hecke meant the midfielder Carlos Baleba filled in alongside Dunk on Saturday. It will be intriguing to see whether Hürzeler sticks with his skipper for next week’s game againstBrentfordor hands the January signing Eiran Cashin a first start instead.Ed AaronsMatch report:Brighton 2-2 LeicesterView image in fullscreenLewis Dunk struggled against Leicester.Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images9Edu top of the tree at new-look ForestNot much actually happened on the pitch at the City Ground until Abdoulaye Doucouré’s 94th-minute winner forEverton. Nuno Espírito Santo admitted there were “no positives” on a dismal day for Forest. The most interesting thing to come out of the afternoon for the Tricky Trees was the fact Edu was in attendance. The former Arsenal sporting director is expected to join Evangelos Marinakis’s multi-club network that also includes Olympiakos and Rio Ave, and Edu could spearhead a plan to add a Brazilian side to the operation. For years Forest struggled to create a professional setup at the top of the club. Adding Edu to a department that includes the recruitment gurus George Syrianos and Ross Wilson shows the ambition is growing to run a successful club with a clear long-term strategy. Whether Forest qualify for the Champions League or not, the foundations will be stronger for years to come.Will UnwinMatch report:Nottingham Forest 0-1 Everton10Villa pool of talent is now deeperThe factAston Villaare having trouble deciding who takes their penalties is, in itself, a sign of their new-found attacking depth. Marco Asensio hasn’t done much wrong since arriving on loan from PSG in January, but his two penalty misses at Southampton have left Unai Emery with a problem, after the manager admitted his fellow countryman had been Villa’s first choice from the spot. “We have our penalty shooters,” said Emery after the win at Southampton. “The first one is Marcus Rashford, the second is Marco Asensio, the third is Youri Tielemans, John McGinn or Ollie Watkins.” It seems a long time ago that much was being made of Emery’s decision to bench Watkins in favour of Jhon Durán earlier in the campaign. Despite Durán’s departure, Emery now has Watkins, Rashford, Asensio, Morgan Rogers, Donyell Malen, Jacob Ramsey and Leon Bailey to pick from.Dominic BoothMatch report:Southampton 0-3 Aston VillaPosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool3243762Arsenal3230633Nottm Forest3213574Newcastle3116565Man City3220556Chelsea3217547Aston Villa323548Fulham315489Brighton3224810AFC Bournemouth31114511Brentford3244312Crystal Palace3114313Everton32-43814Man Utd32-73815Tottenham Hotspur32113716Wolverhampton32-143517West Ham32-183518Ipswich32-342119Leicester32-451820Southampton32-5410Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballManchester CityNottingham ForestNewcastle UnitedManchester UnitedLiverpoolWest Ham UnitedfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That changed on Monday afternoon when they released a statement announcing his diagnosis and including a message from Howe thanking medical staff for their care and the wider football community for their good wishes.Howe remains in hospital but Tindall sure Newcastle win has ‘lifted his spirits’Read moreHis assistant, Jason Tindall, aided by Graeme Jones, will once again lead the team at home against Crystal ­Palace on Wednesday night and at Aston Villa on Saturday evening. It is still unclear when Howe will be well enough to return to work but Newcastle are expected to issue further updates after the Villa game.Howe watchedNewcastle defeat Manchester United 4-1 on Sundayon television from his hospital bed a long goal kick away from St James’ Park, but was too unwell to have any remote input on proceedings. After beating Ruben Amorim’s side, Tindall saidhe had received a text message from the managerbut had not spoken to Howe for a number of days.After his illness was revealed on Monday, Howe issued a message via the Newcastle website. “A huge thank you to everyone connected withNewcastle Unitedand the wider football community for your messages and warm wishes,” he said. “They have meant a lot to me and my family.“I also want to pay tribute to our incredible NHS and the hospital staff who have treated me.

He hopes that a memorable season, which only a fortnight ago involved him and his players being serenaded by 300,000 fans in central Newcastle, will end with Champions League qualification.Given that Newcastle are fourth and would leapfrog Nottingham Forest into third with a draw against ­Palace, a place in Europe’s showpiece competition is within their grasp. Howe will hope to be back alongside Tindall in the technical area for the campaign’s closing stages.Explore more on these topicsEddie HoweNewcastle UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

Napoli defender Juan Jesus had to go off with what looked like a hamstring injury, before Lukaku fired wide from David Neres’s cross.“Romelu is a great teammate. He demands a lot from all the team and me to score more goals and create more opportunities for him to score as well,” McTominay told Dazn after the game. “He’s obviously a great player. He’s had a great career, and we’re so happy to have him.”“We must have fun and think about ourselves,” the former Manchester United player added. “We’re a strong team and must continue with this playing style and attitude.

Lampard served a one-match touchline ban at the MKM Stadium and was fined £2,000 after his sending off at the end ofthe defeat by Burnleyearlier this month for an outburst at referee James Bell.While Coventry largely dominated Hull and went ahead through a deflected strike from Matt Grimes, who earlier produced two goalline blocks to deny Kasey Palmer, substitute Abu Kamara equalised. Lampard’s side therefore stay sixth, moving three points clear of seventh-placed West Brom, and the manager may rue his team’s lack of a clinical edge as Hull goalkeeper Ivor Pandur made several important saves.Semenyo’s swift strike stuns Fulham to end Bournemouth’s winless runRead moreHull remain in 20th but are now three points clear of the relegation zone with just four matches left, largely thanks to the heroics of Pandur. The Croatian was out of position early on when Ellis Simms got in behind the defence but a poorly executed lob went wide, although the Hull shot-stopper then did well to push away Haji Wright’s header.Pandur denied Wright twice more as Coventry continued to dominate but Hull had the best chance of the half after 38 minutes as Palmer’s two shots from Regan Slater’s cutback were blocked on the line. With the goal gaping, the former Coventry midfielder saw his low efforts kept out by a perfectly positioned Grimes, whose clearance thumped into teammate Milan van Ewijk but somehow stayed out of the net.View image in fullscreenCoventry City head coach Frank Lampard walks through the stand as he served a one-match touchline ban.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAGrimes’ interventions gained added significance when Coventry went ahead a minute after the break to get the goal their first-half display deserved – even if Hull could count themselves unfortunate. Grimes was involved again as Hull half-cleared to the edge of the box and his scuffed left-footed volley took a cruel deflection off Charlie Hughes, with Pandur having committed to diving the other way.Grimes’ opener soon should have been added to as a quick burst from Simms left the Hull defence in his wake but despite no lack of power on his shot, Pandur was able to excellently tip away for a corner. Even then, Hull were not out of the woods as Wright’s close-range header came back off a post, while Jack Rudoni’s teasing cross after skipping past a couple of Hull challenges just evaded Simms.With Hull getting thoroughly outclassed, Rubén Sellés introduced Nordin Amrabat and Kamara just before the hour and it had the desired effect as the latter struck with just eight minutes remaining. This time, Coventry were left cursing their luck as Kamara’s strike from a narrow angle ricocheted off Jay Dasilva and wrongfooted goalkeeper Bradley Collins before trickling in at the near post.Coventry still might have nicked all three points at the death but Pandur produced one final vital stop by parrying away Van Ewijk’s sharp shot from the edge of the area as it finished all-square on a frustrating night for the visiting manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Villa must overturn a two-goal deficit after a first-leg defeat in France and the Villa manager doubled down on his belief that his side can cause a shock, with Emery adamant the “fortress” atmosphere at Villa Park on Tuesday can help his players find a winning formula.Emery said PSG’s 3-1 lead does not alter the task at hand. “I have experiences coming back from results, positively and negatively,” he said. “Now it is something different, we want to write here the history with Aston Villa. Last year [we played] in the Conference League and this year in theChampions Leagueand [now] hopefully for a long time in Europe. My experiences before were different … sometimes losing away and winning at home, sometimes losing at home and winning away. More winning than losing … but I had some negative experiences as well.”Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreEmery was on the wrong end of an infamous fightback when Luis Enrique’sBarcelona triumphed 6-1 at the Camp Nou against his PSG teamin the Champions League in 2017, a humiliating last-16 exit, known asLa Remontada(“The Comeback”), given PSG won the first leg 4-0. Emery won the Europa League with Sevilla in 2014, his first major European trophy, after recovering from a 2-0 first-leg reverse against Real Betis earlier in the competition.Emery added: “I’m not going to remind the players of those experiences because my idea and my every word with the players inside is sending the message of how we are getting experiences together here withAston Villa. With the players we are, with the experiences we are adding in our bag last year and this year. As well with the combination we have with our players mentally and as well tactically to play, being so, so demanding in our process to get opportunities and believing to beat PSG. We need to use Villa Park like a fortress. We have felt it a lot of times. We have to believe.”Emery dismissed suggestions PSG could be fresher given they have had a clear run of six days before the second leg, while Villa travelled to Southampton andwon 3-0 on Saturday. The Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), French football’s governing body, agreed to reschedule PSG’s Ligue 1 match with Nantes, which was originally scheduled for last ­weekend. “We have the habit of playing a lot of matches in a row, three matches in a week, and as well they also have this habit,” the Villa manager said. “They are ready to play. They are rested but for me it’s not very relevant.”The England forward Morgan Rogers, a key Villa player this season, echoed Emery’s sentiments that the atmosphere could be a secret ingredient in any comeback. “There’s massive belief. Most people wrote us off before the tie. We’re excited, under the lights at home, playing in the quarter-finals of this competition … there are not many places better to be. If anyone’s going to turn it around, it’s going to be us.”Asked about the role of the supporters, Rogers added: “In the position we’re in, the second leg being at home is massive for us. We can create our own atmosphere. We have done it this season in the big games, not just in the Champions League but in our big league games as well. They’re a massive boost for us. That energy, that feeling, that vibe is sometimes bigger than the actual game.“That’s what drives you on … you can forget about all the tactics or the intricate stuff we’re going to work on, sometimes it’s just about that sheer energy and heart and determination within the stadium. Sometimes that can be just enough to pull you through tough moments and get you to where you need to go. We need every bit of support and we’ll feed off that 100%. We’re excited for the challenge.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

PSG have conceded seven Ligue 1 goals from set pieces but just two in the Champions League. “If I speak about them, maybe tomorrow they will perform fantastically,” he said, smiling. “They have been successful defensively at set pieces.

Aged 69, diagnosed with leukaemia five years ago, wearing a grey cardigan, blue jacket and a slightly manic smile, he’s thinner than before but couldn’t be more familiar. Joaquín Caparrós has coachedSevillamore times than anyone, across three spells, the first a quarter of a century ago; now he was returning for a fourth. “My face is a reflection; it says it all,” he said, leaving the station and stopping on the corner, searching for the car coming for him.Caparrós arrived on a train, alone and as their saviour. Assomebody’ssaviour, anyway: someone to get behind, someone to hide behind too, for a little while. Two days earlier Sevilla had lost 1-0 at Valencia. That night, manager Xavier García Pimienta said he would be with his players until the end of the world but he didn’t make it to the end of the weekend. On Thursday, the president José Maria del Nido Carrasco had declared it “time to be close to the coaching staff” and on Saturday they took training as normal; 24 hours later, they had been sacked. Caparrós had already been called. He will be their eighth coach in less than three seasons.Der Klassiker lacked do-or-die drama but Bayern will feel the consequences | Andy BrassellRead moreYou suspected that García Pimienta wouldn’t be there at the end of this season from the moment the president said he would be there at the end of the season after next. If ever there was a scene that sums it all up, guaranteed to be recorded and replayed, a moment that immediately said: “Make a note of this: you’ll be needing it later,” it came after Sevilla’s 2-1 victory over Real Valladolid in September when Del Nido announced that the club was constructing a long-term project and that their faith in the coach and players was “absolute”.That day, Del Nido gathered the squad together in the dressing room, some players sitting on the benches, others spread out on treatment tables. Making sure it was all set up nicely, the camera filming from just the right angle, the president told them and the rest of the world – it was on social media before the coach made it to the press room, waiting journalists toldto look on X instead– that the coach was extending his deal for another year. “Themisterwill be with us until 2027 at least,” he said. García Pimienta had only been in the job two months, and already they were renewing his contract. Well, theyhadjust beaten 18th-placed Valladolid.Actually, the decision had been made, Del Nido claimed, before they had won at all, unanimously agreed ahead of their only other victory at that point: against 19th-placed Getafe. There had been no doubts, just something bigger: a plan, complete conviction, of course. Which is why they hadn’t just given him three years in the first place and why and it took 23 days and two wins to announce it now. “I guess they saw how I worked and liked it – I don’t know why they didn’t offer it in the summer,” García Pimienta said. “This is another demonstration of the confidence we have in the coach and you,” the president claimed. Sevilla were seven games into the season. With seven games left, the coach has gone.If that all sounds a bit weird, it is because it is; it was weird then and it is weird now, something crushingly inevitable about how it all unravelled. Another grand gesture revealed to be empty, it has to be seen in the context of a club and a family at war with itself and almost bankrupt, where the fans demand the board resign, there is a vicious, destructive fight over ownership, and García Pimienta was their sixth coach in two years. His extension was an attempt to project an image of stability at a place on the edge of the abyss, to express the authority of a president with precious little of it, and release the pressure on the coach. It was a message for internal as well as external consumption perhaps best revealed in García Pimienta interrupting Del Nido’s words to his players with a glance to one side of the room and a pointed joke: “Good news … except for you, who wanted me to go.”View image in fullscreenJoaquín Caparros (centre) is welcomed at a presentation with club president José María del Nido Carrasco and sporting director Victor Orta.Photograph: Raúl Caro Cadenas/EPAWell, now he has. Friday’s defeat in a game between clubs that were big not so very long ago was Sevilla’s fourth in a row and it saw them slip to 14th in the table, just seven points off relegation. It is not what they expected. But here’s the thing: it probably should be. It is only three years since Sevilla genuinely looked like they could compete for the league titlefor a second season in a rowand only two since theywon the Europa League. But that season, and the season after, they had to fight for survival. Their golden days are long gone, money gone too.Monchi, the sporting director who was much more than a sporting director – the man who made it all work, left, came back and left again – admitted that, driven by ambition, they had held on to players longer than they probably should have as they chased those league titles. The loss of European football hit hard, so did the pandemic. Mismanagement hit even harder, and they have run at a loss for the last three seasons, the operating costs too high. The debt is over €300m; the sales that they had built a model around have slowed, the returns diminishing, the level of the squad doing so too.Under Victor Orta, who replaced Monchi as sporting director and was faced by a new reality, 14 players departed this summer. The sale of Youssef EnNesyri raised €19.5m, Lucas Ocampos €7.2m, Gonzalo Montiel €4.5m, Marcos Acuña €1m; the rest went free, and that money was mostly swallowed by the debt. Six of the 10 players they signed came for free; the rest cost €17m. None has truly made a significant impact. The surprise was perhaps that they could even do that much business: when the official salary limits were announced at the start of this season, Sevilla’s was the lowest in the league – acrossbothdivisions. Under €2.5m then, after Christmas it was set at €684,000.They had been through managers fast, and that cost them too: the former president this week claimed that they have will paid €24m in payoffs in two years.Julen Lopetegui was sackedjust seven weeks into the 2022-23 season having finished fourth three years running, the opportunity to let go at the right moment allowed to pass. Jorge Sampaoli’s second coming was absurd. José Luis Mendilibar saved them and won the Europa League, so they stuck with him, even though they didn’t really want to, then sacked him eight weeks into the following season. Diego Alonso hadn’t managed a game in Europe when he arrived and hadn’t won one when he left. Quique Sánchez Flores kept them up but there was no way he would continue; he had not enjoyed it at all. He talked of a depression at the club, the need for them to start again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionGarcía Pimienta, who had worked with Barcelona B, was the man to build something from the bottom. Even if it turned out the players he had didn’t really fit his footballing identity. “I would like the academy players to come through at better times, not by necessity,” he said, but he knew the reality. And now he has paid for it, and for his own failings. Sevilla’s four defeats in a row have come against Athletic (1-0), Betis (2-1), Atlético (2-1) and Valencia (1-0). Before that they had lost just one in nine. No, it wasn’t always very good – only three of those were wins, they have won just nine all year and after Friday’s defeat Jose Angel Carmona insisted “we can’t go on like this” – but the threat of relegation isn’t real. And if you say you want a project, this is it; if you are going to be patient, to have faith, now is the time to prove it. Instead, they went for something completely different, another change of direction, that long-term project replaced by another call to the man who brought them back to the first division 25 long years ago, who came to rescue them in 2018 and 2019, hasn’t had a club since, and is back to rescue them again.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowAlavés 0-1 Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao 3-1 Rayo Vallecano, Celta Vigo 0-2 Espanyol, Getafe 1-3 Las Palmas, Leganés 0-1 Barcelona, Osasuna 2-1 Girona, Real Betis 1-2 Villarreal, Real Sociedad 0-2 Mallorca, Valencia 1-0 SevillaMondayAtlético Madrid v Real Valladolid (8pm BST)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But rescue who and from what?Thisis not a crisis,that’s a crisis, the one off the pitch: the most convincing conclusion is this sacking is not even really about the football. It is as much about something at once more superficial and far deeper, about ambition and incompetence, about Del Nido’s desperation to hold on to the club in the face of opposition from the former president who is also his father, and from everyone else now too. It is about a club where everything is wrong, staff are laid off, the debt grows and so does the conflict, where the balance of power is precarious and shifting, the courts are involved, deals and threats are made behind the scenes, and “the Americans” – bankrupt 777 Partners – have changed investors and changed sides too. Where AGMs end in insults and accusations, Del Nido Sr refuses to abandon his assault on power, and calls Del Nido Jr “a shit”, demanding he depart and asking: “Aren’t you ashamed?”All the while fans watch their club collapse, this whole circus, football falling victim to the real crisis. They turn on the directors’ box and demand departures, the division so great, the threat so real, that for the men sitting there gripping their seats in silence the conclusion becomes clear: apart from their anger, the hurt they feel, maybe only one thing, one man, could unite the Sánchez Pizjuán now, Joaquín Caparrós arriving in the city by train on Sunday.PosTeamPGDPts1Barcelona3155702Real Madrid3133663Atletico Madrid3025604Athletic Bilbao3124575Villarreal3013516Real Betis313487Celta Vigo31-1438Mallorca31-6439Real Sociedad31-44110Rayo Vallecano31-44011Getafe3133912Osasuna31-83813Valencia31-123714Sevilla31-83615Espanyol30-73516Girona31-103417Alaves31-123018Las Palmas31-152919Leganes31-192820Valladolid30-5016Explore more on these topicsLa LigaSevillaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 44-year-old, whose contract is due to run out in June 2026, has been in charge since 2022 and oversaw sixth and eighth‑place finishes in the 2022-23 and 2023-24 Women’s Super League.His team sit eighth, three points behind fifth-placed Brighton and 10 points clear of the relegation zone, after three wins in their past six games.Everton had been bottom of the WSL in mid-November after struggling with injuries early in the campaign but they have enjoyed a resurgence sincebeating Liverpool at Goodison Parkand were buoyed up by the completion ofThe Friedkin Group’s takeoverof the club in December.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TFG recently commissioned a feasibility study into the viability of Goodison Parkbecoming the long-term homeof the women’s side.Sørensen’s assistant manager, Stephen Neligan, is also close to extending his stay. The Australian has worked with Sørensen since 2020, as they teamed up at the Danish clubs FC Nordsjælland and Fortuna Hjørring.A new deal for Sørensen – the second-longest serving of the current WSL managers, behind Manchester United’s Marc Skinner – would go against the recent trend. Of the 12 WSL clubs, eight had different coaches in charge 12 months ago, while five managers have left their posts this season. Everton and Sørensen are understood to be keen to bring stability to the team.Everton have recalled their 17‑year‑old defender Issy Hobson from her loan spell at the Women’s Championship’s bottom side, Sheffield United, to make her available for the final four league fixtures of the WSL campaign.Explore more on these topicsEverton WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

With promotion toLigue 1secured and new owners onboard, the clubcould dream of replicating past glories. But waking up the sleeping giant of French football has not been as easy as flicking a switch.St-Étienne returned to the top flight after a two-year stint in Ligue 2 thanks to a dour relegation playoff win against Metz. Olivier Dall’Oglio, who replaced Laurent Batlles as manager mid-season, took the club up by reverting to a defensive, back-to-basics approach. However, that approach did not translate well in Ligue 1, despite a summer splurge from the new owners.Kilmer Sports Ventures completed their takeover in the summer and immediately put their hands in their pockets. Eleven players have arrived since the Canadians purchased the club; only PSG,Monaco, Marseille, Rennes, Lyon and Strasbourg spent more during the summer window. The large investment contrasted starkly to the other two promoted sides, Auxerre and Angers, with the latter not spending a penny.The new arrivals were exciting. Zuriko Davitashvili was excellent with Bordeaux in Ligue 2 and featured for Georgia at the Euros; Belgian youth international Lucas Stassin had shown great promise with KVC Westerlo; and France U20 international Pierre Ekwah arrived on loan from Sunderland highly-rated. But, bar former Reims captain Yunis Abdelhamid, the new players had very little experience. St-Étienne were preparing for the long-term but neglecting the short-term, putting the cart before the horse, walking before they could run. Their sudden jump in ambition marked a wild swing from the previous decade of inertia, but they are yet to find a happy medium and it could cost them their place in the top flight.An 8-0 humbling against Nice in September was a bitter dose of reality. “The feeling is one of shame,” said Dall’Oglio. Huss Fahmy, the Kilmer vice-president, and Loïc Perrin, a St-Étienne legend who is now the club’s sporting coordinator, both addressed the dressing room after that defeat, but they decided to keep Dall’Oglio in his post. However, when the situation had not improved by December, the axe fell.He was replaced by the highly energetic but inexperienced Eirik Horneland. “He is a long-term choice,” said the St-Étienne president Ivan Gazidis. “We will work on the short term but especially on the long term,” added Horneland as he accepted his first job outside of his native Norway. With the club’s gaze fixed on distant horizons, there is a more imminent threat – the spectre of relegation now dominates their field of vision.Horneland’s appointment marked a mid-season shift from Dall’Oglio’s pragmatic, defensive approach. “It is important to play an attacking style of football,” said the former Brann manager. Centre-back Dylan Batubinsika says the manager wants more “risk-taking” and to “keep the ball in build-up play”, adding that this new style is “very intense”.Implementing a new approach without a pre-season would be difficult enough, but it becomes nigh-on impossible when the squad isn’t tailored for it either. Playing out from the back has been a particular issue; St-Étienne have made 659 stray passes in their own half (22 per match) – more than any other side in Ligue 1 this season.View image in fullscreenSt-Étienne fans express their frustrations.Photograph: Stephane Pillaud/PsNewz/ShutterstockThey were at it again in their 3-3 draw with Brest on Sunday. Ludovic Ajorque gave Brest the lead after just six minutes following Irvin Cardona’s mistake. Wanting to play out from the back is all well and good, but not if you lack the quality to do it. The tactic has left goalkeeper Gautier Larsonneur overly exposed. No goalkeeper in Europe’s top five leagues has conceded more goals than the Frenchman (67); he is also in the top five for shots saved (113). That is telling.The defence has been porous and dreadfully passive. Abdelhamid was brought in as a solution but it quickly became evident that, at 37, it was one season too many. He was error-prone under Dall’Oglio and has not started since Horneland’s arrival.The team are conceding even more regularly under Horneland, which was always likely given his approach. The issue is that their own goals-per-game figure has not risen sufficiently (1.35 under Horneland compared to 0.8 under Dall’Oglio), so they are picking up fewer points under their new manager. They see more of the ball but are not creating enough chances – and are second bottom in the xG table.The issue is a top-heavy side created by an uneven recruitment drive. Stassin and Davitashvili are overwhelming success stories and ones for the future. The former is the team’s top scorer with eight goals, including a thunderbolt against Brest at the weekend. And the latter has 14 goal contributions in his first season in Ligue 1. But, despite some strong performances from midfielder Benjamin Bouchouari, the team is not providing them with regular service.A late chip from Cardona salvaged a point against Brest as he redeemed himself for his earlier error but, with Reims beating Lens, the club’s chances of survival are diminishing. There has been a naivety to St-Étienne’s approach that permeates all levels of the club. Perhaps that was to be expected given their lack of experience; ambition does not guarantee competence.Horneland wants to produce attractive, attacking football while securing results but, despite the club’s financial means, they do not yet have the players to produce that style. “Fuck, we are rubbish,” read a banner at the Geoffroy-Guichard at the weekend. Negativity and a sense of impending doom are the order of the day at St-Étienne. The broader outlook suggests they can become a force in French football once more, but they have a long way to go before they relive their 1970s pomp.Quick GuideShowSt-Étienne 3-3 BrestAngers 2-0 MontpellierLe Havre 1-5 RennesAuxerre 1-3 LyonMonaco 3-0 MarseilleToulouse 1-2 LilleStrasbourg 2-2 NiceLens 0-2 ReimsWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Talking pointsRoberto De Zerbi was uncharacteristically calm and rational after Marseille’s damaging 3-0 loss at Monaco. “It is not about looking for someone to blame,” said the Italian, who has previously reacted to heavy defeats by accusing players of “embarrassing” him and tendering his resignation publicly. “When strong words are needed, I say them. But today is different. I am more optimistic than after some wins this season,” he added. Adi Hütter largely agreed, saying the scoreline was “a bit flattering”. Takumi Minamino scored from Monaco’s only clear chance of the first half before Luis Henrique produced a miss-of-the-season contender for Marseille just before the break. Monaco’s intensity blew their opponents away in the second half, with Breel Embolo and Denis Zakaria both scoring. Monaco jump back up to second at Marseille’s expense but, with five games to go, they are far from a shoo-in for Champions League qualification.Luis Enrique said PSG would improve without Kylian Mbappé. He was rightRead moreLyon’s 3-1 win at Auxerre has taken them into the final qualification spot, just two points behind Monaco. They are only the third away side, along with Monaco and Strasbourg, to have won at the Stade de l’Abbé-Deschamps this season.

It is a road that usually leads to disaster, making it hard to understand why Maresca was so eager to veer into dodgy territory by having a pop at the crowd afterChelsea’s 2-2 draw with Ipswichon Sunday.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreThe Italian’s tone-deaf comments about the “environment” at Stamford Bridge being the reason for his team trailing 2-0 against opponents who could be relegated this weekend have gone down as well as could be expected. Fans who already had little time for Maresca have predictably taken offence. All they see is an unpopular manager looking to make excuses. They do not want to be lectured when Chelsea are 14th in the Premier League form table since Christmas and in danger of missing outon Champions League qualification.Maresca lacks clout. Bringing him in for Mauricio Pochettino last summer was a gamble. He is inexperienced and trying to win over fans spoilt by watching sides led by Carlo Ancelotti, Antonio Conte, Thomas Tuchel and José Mourinho win trophy after trophy over the past 20 years. That’s one tough audience and it is pointless accusing them of being entitled. Football fans are stubborn and precious. It is not an equal relationship. Fans can moan as much as they like but they erupt if they are criticised, especially when the disapproval comes from a manager whose football is regarded by much of Chelsea’s paying public as a cure for insomnia.Only the very best can get away with it. Mourinho once called out the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge but he was a club legend backed up by silverware. Maresca, by contrast, was hired after winning the Championship with Leicester. He cannot afford to lose the fans, even if he cannot understand why there seems to be a moment in every home game when there is grumbling from the stands about Chelsea’s patient style of play.This pattern is unsustainable. Maresca, who has used Instagram to ask for positivity before games, gestured angrily for fans to be more supportive after Marc Cucurella broke the deadlockagainst Leicester last monthand the mood was no less tense against Ipswich. Chelsea had wobbled after falling behind to Julio Enciso’s goal. The dissent grew after a shaky attempt to play out from a goal kick by Robert Sánchez and his back four led to the Ipswich midfielder Jens Cajuste shooting just wide from 20 yards.View image in fullscreenIpswich players celebrate after Julio Enciso’s opening goal.Photograph: David Cliff/EPAIt is a recurring theme with Sánchez, who remains Chelsea’s No 1 despite clearly not being up to the job. The former Brighton goalkeeper’s first piece of shaky distribution had come when he sent a pass straight to Jack Clarke in the fourth minute. Sánchez does not inspire trust. The Spaniard is lucky that only five of his mistakes have led to goals this season. He is less fortunate to be seen as the symbol of all that is wrong with Marescaball, with its mannered buildup play, inverted full-backs and rigid attacking formulas.There were boos from the Matthew Harding Stand as Sánchez lined up the goal kick that followed Cajuste’s effort. This was a systems failure. There were ironic cheers when Sánchez urged his teammates forward and kicked long. Unfortunately Ipswich won the next header, attacked and made it 2-0.For Maresca, who also endured supporter unrest at Leicester last season, the whole episode was evidence that the atmosphere had got on top of his players. He argued that going long doesn’t lead to more control. “The second goal we decide to play long because of the environment and we concede,” he said. Missing from his analysis, though, was an explanation for why taking a long goal kick would make his side so vulnerable to an instant riposte from Ipswich. It did not have to lead to George Hirst bullying Chelsea’s centre-backs in the air, Trevoh Chalobah being pulled out of position at right-back and Ben Johnson outjumping Cucurella at the far post.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionGood teams – teams with characters and leaders – can adapt and mix up their approach. The accusation against Maresca is inflexibility. Chelsea, who are outside the top five with six games left, improved in the second half but they did not create many chances before Jadon Sancho’s late equaliser. There is concern over Cole Palmer’s regression in recent months.It makes fans sceptical about Chelsea’s directionunder the ownership of Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. The sense is it feels like the boos are not so much for Sánchez as the entire process. Fans who pay a lot for their tickets cannot understand why a spend of more than £1bn on signings has not led to better results. What they are really doing is having a pop at the sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, for hiring Maresca.But it is rarely the executives who lose out. Stewart and Winstanley enjoy the support of Behdad Eghbali, Clearlake’s co-founder and the most influential voice at Chelsea. It is always easier to change the manager – particularly one who is starting to give the impression that life would be easier if games were played in empty stadiums.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

My goal is to support the club’s growth in a positive way and to help to build an exciting future.”Swansea are fronted by the American owners Andy Coleman, Brett Cravatt and Jason Cohen. They are 12th in the Championship after a renaissance under their caretaker head coach, Alan Sheehan, who succeeded Luke Williams in February. Swansea host Hull on Friday and have taken 17 points from nine matches under Sheehan. He is expected to be a leading candidate to take the job on a permanent basis.Modric’s arrival is the latest in a series of changes behind the scenes. Tom Gorringe, formerly of Bristol Rovers, recently replaced Coleman as chief executive while the director of football, Richard Montague, arrived from Notts County to replace Paul Watson.“Swansea City is delighted to announce that Ballon d’Or winner Luka Modrić has joined the club as an investor and co-owner,” Swansea said. “Luka’s investment in the club is an endorsement of the club’s ambition and vision. He will play a key role in helping the club garner global attention and progress both on and off the pitch.”Modric’s investment is not thought to be a barrier to him continuing his playing career. He hopes to captain Croatia at the 2026 World Cup and has made clear he wants to continue at Real, although a change of manager could spell the end for him at a club where he has won six Champions Leagues and four La Liga titles since signing from Tottenham in 2012.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Step aside, George Best. McIlroy’s Masters triumph may even force Sports Personality of the Year to afford due recognition to golf. It is only April but it feels highly unlikely the scene immediatelyafter McIlroy claimed the Masterson Sunday will be matched. His pounding of the turf; his tears absorbed more than a decade of such deep frustration. The moment reverberated beyond sport; Rory had done it. Grown men, lots of them, shed tears on his behalf as he broke his Augusta hoodoo.Nick Faldo six, Rory McIlroy five. Were this a football match, Faldo would be the winner. Yet in golf there is nuance. McIlroy might trail Faldo’s overall majors haul – for now – but the completion of the career grand slam pressed home new status for McIlroy. No European had secured the set before. He is the finest golfer this continent has produced.Faldo was the grinder who got the job done. There were, of course, stunning moments. The Englishman’s takedown of Greg Norman in the 1996 Masters represented true sporting theatre. It is a statistical oddity that Faldo had just three Masters top 10s, all victories. McIlroy is the natural artist, the people’s champion who in the latest Masters edition proved that he has a game to pass every exam. Differing course conditions are the standard reference point for McIlroy’s earlier major glories. This one was all about the state of his mind.Resilience won McIlroy’s Mastersfar more than panache. His biggest opponent sat between his ears.View image in fullscreenNick Faldo, on his way to winning his third Masters title in 1996.Photograph: Stephen Munday/Getty ImagesMcIlroy has scope to press home the European point. When partying from Augusta eventually subsides – and he is entitled to do as much of that as he wants – there will be competitive refocus. McIlroy has spent more than a decade chasing his grand slam. At times, it looked like it consumed him. Now, in his own words, “free” from that burden, he could be a seriously dangerous animal. The US PGA Championship takes place next month at Quail Hollow, where McIlroy has a formidable record.There wastrauma at Royal Portrushin 2019 but the Open Championship’s return this summer offers McIlroy a platform to settle a score at a venue he has known since childhood. He will naturally target Faldo and the half‑dozen when, still aged just 35, he has a decent window to endorse his greatness with a much bigger major tally. “This will take the world off his shoulders and I think you’ll see a lot more great golf out of Rory McIlroy,” said Jack Nicklaus, the 18-time major winner. Nicklaus has not lost his touch; he tipped McIlroy to win the Masters on Thursday morning.McIlroy’s competitive longevity does not get sufficient credit. A glance at the world golf rankings from the end of 2014, when he last won two majors, leads you to ponder “whatever happened to … ” time and again. Justin Rose,who came so closeto shattering McIlroy’s dream, is notable at No 6.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In winning the Masters, McIlroy routinely used escapism of which Ballesteros would have been proud. Ballesteros won four of his majors inside five years and all of them inside nine. He never looked capable of winning a US Open, which like the US PGA Championship duly eluded him. McIlroy is Seve Plus.There will be shouts for Harry Vardon in this conversation. The man from Jersey won the Open six times and lifted the US Open trophy in 1900. Vardon’s grip was a huge contribution to golf. It feels impossible, though, to compare the sport Vardon was involved in – niblicks, jiggers et al – to the scene of today. Vardon never broke 70 with his Gutta-Percha in those half‑dozen Open triumphs (in his defence, he did not have to). The competitive strength of golf in this era is as never before.McIlroy’s influence on golf has been huge. He has drawn people towards it, including as a properly athletic pursuit. His willingness to speak so openly, so candidly and so often adds to his appeal. He has also been statesmanlike in the game at a time when it has beenpulled apart by civil war. He never needed to do that, in fact perhaps wishes he did not, but it came naturally. McIlroy’s voice is a sane one. He feels responsibility to use it.Sunday at the Masters was no time for vocal engagement. Bryson DeChambeau could not handle McIlroy’s Masters charge, the American later raising, in slightly snippy terms, the fact the champion did not speak to him mid-round. If DeChambeau wants small talk, he should head to a coffee morning.McIlroy’s working‑class upbringing, with his mother combining several jobs, adds to this fairytale. Nothing came easily in Holywood. Mention the theory of God-given talent and McIlroy recoils; he has worked, worked and worked for everything in this sport. Harry Diamond, McIlroy’s caddie, is a lifelong best friend who has been unfairly castigated as majors slipped through fingers. Diamond deliberately shuns the limelight when his role in McIlroy’s ongoing achievement should be recognised.Luke Donald, McIlroy’s neighbour in Florida, will take great delight in the Masters outcome. One of umpteen strandsassociated with McIlroy’s playoff winis that it took place in a Ryder Cup year. Come September and Bethpage, Donald will be calling upon a McIlroy still riding his Augusta wave.McIlroy needed a Masters win to shift his own psychological status. This was the plot twist of all plot twists. It was, furthermore, a reminder to enjoy him while he lasts. McIlroy, the generational talent, has no European peer.Explore more on these topicsRory McIlroyThe MastersGolfEuropean TourPGA TourUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In August 2022, Palace went 2-0 up at the Etihad, the second goal a header from a corner but City came back to win 4-2, Erling Haaland scoring a hat-trick in a dominant second-half performance. Saturday’s game followed a similar path, with the exception that the City comeback began before half-time. This time the key figure wasn’t Haaland, but Kevin De Bruyne, who produced a display to remind everybody just how worthy he was of the tributes that have followed the announcement that he will leave the club in the summer.Does this, then, mean that City are somehow suddenly back? They’re unbeaten in five games, three of them won. The January signings, Omar Marmoush in particular, have enabled them to stabilise.They are back in the top fiveand should qualify for the Champions League next season (with all the usual caveats aboutthe Premier League charges they are facing, which they deny). That is a significant step as they look to rebuild, not only in terms of being to attract players but for futurePSR calculations.They remain capable of glorious attacking football. They are still capable, when the mood is with them, of moving the ball with a pace and sense of purpose beyond most sides. And they still, obviously, have a clutch of supremely gifted players. But they do not have the aura of old.In part the issue is self-belief, as was apparent in the drab 0-0 draw at Manchester United last week. United, it’s true, are a team who had been consolidating recently and are not as bad as they were. But still, they are vulnerable, as Newcastle showed in beating them 4-1 on Sunday, and City essentially chose not to test them. They took a point rather than risk defeat – againstthisUnited. That is something that would have seemed almost incomprehensible for aPep Guardiolaside of old.And while it is true that City have often struggle to contain Palace in the past (Palace have scored two against them in five of their last six meetings), the ease with which Oliver Glasner’s team cut through them on Saturday was striking. Both the first goal and the effort Eberechi Eze had ruled out for offside were the result of simple balls played in behind the defensive line. No defence should be exposed so easily. Any side that plays a line as high as City’s will always be vulnerable to runs in behind them, but a coordinated and aggressive press should compensate, increasing the difficulty for an opposing player to measure a pass to such a runner. That press for City is not functioning as it should and that means they can never have the level of control to which Guardiola aspires.The question then remains why, and whether the issues can be resolved next season. The return of Rodri, obviously, will make a huge difference, although it shouldn’t be assumed that he will instantly rediscover the form that earned him the Ballon d’Or. Other injuries, particularly to defenders, have not helped. If they are the result of fatigue, the fact City have the Club World Cup to contend with in the summer means those concerns may continue.But the biggest issue, the first major miscalculation City have made since appointing Guardiola, was to allow the squad to grow old together – indeed, to make it older by re-signing Ilkay Gündogan. Kyle Walker (before his loan move to Milan), Bernardo Silva, Mateo Kovačić and De Bruyne have all given the impression that age has caught up with them. A club can carry one or two seasoned veterans; four or five is too many, particularly when the style is as intense as the way City play.Signings, clearly, can rectify that. Ederson, Joško Gvardiol, Rodri, Haaland, Marmoush and Phil Foden still represent the nucleus of a very good squad. Oscar Bobb is on his way back from injury. There is promise in Rico Lewis, Nico O’Reilly and James McAtee. Add on three or more summer signings and the squad will look as good as ever.But there is a question too about Guardiola. Perhaps he does; he has, after all, demonstrated a remarkable flexibility and capacity to adapt and evolve over his career. Why should he not be able to rebuild? But after 17 years as a manager, does he still have the requisite energy and drive? Very few are able to keep going at the very top for more than a decade. There is no reason to believe Guardiola’s very public frustration when results went awry before Christmas signals a downturn but, equally, even the very best cross the summit and begin their descent eventually.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 15-time major winner, who achieved three grand slams, added: “Completing the grand slam at Augusta is something special.

We are proud to add Rory to our exclusive club and no doubt he has set the standard for his era.“Rory has made his mark on history, and all of us who love this game are incredibly proud. Well done, my friend. Welcome to our club.”Nicklaus, whose first grand slam of three was completed a year after Player’s, spoke warmly of McIlroy’s exploits on CBS. “I’m so happy for him. It will take the world off his shoulders and you’re now going to see a lot more of really good golf out ofRory McIlroy.”McIlroy’s close friend and fellow player Shane Lowry joked that McIlroy could happily retire after completing the career grand slam. “This means everything to him,” Lowry toldGolfChannel. “This is all he thinks about, all he talks about. He always said to me he’d retire a happy man if he won the Green Jacket, so I told Erica [McIlroy’s wife] he can retire now. He’s had a long 10, 11 years, he’s had a lot of hurdles to get over and it’s a credit to him.”Tommy Fleetwood, like Lowry, is a Ryder Cup teammate of McIlroy, and finished tied for 21st after a closing round of 69. “I’ve said it a bunch of times, Rory is the best player of our generation. I don’t think he’s had to prove that for a while,” he said.“For him to have finally got this one, a career grand slam, is unbelievably special.

Northern Ireland’s first minister, Michelle O’Neill, said the “incredible” triumph placed him among the sport’s greatest. “This is a huge moment in sporting history, and one that has filled everyone back home with great pride and that will undoubtedly inspire future generations to chase their dreams,” she posted on X. “Enjoy the well-deserved celebrations, Rory!”The Irish taoiseach, Micheál Martin, posted on X: “The Green Jacket is yours Rory McIlroy.

The UK prime minister added: “Through all the expectations and the rollercoaster ride of yesterday, Rory held his nerve and made history.”The late-night finish – with the playoff concluding just after midnight BST – left Irish newspapers scrambling to reflect the momentous result in their final print editions. The Irish Times’s headline recognised “The Master” on their front page: “Rory finally conquers Augusta and completes Grand Slam”, adding that the victory “seals place among immortals”.The Belfast Telegraph saluted “Rory’s Master piece” after “final hole agony” turned to “play-off ecstasy”. The Irish Independent carried a similar picture of McIlroy roaring in delight after he had collapsed to his knees on sinking the winning putt . It noted the “tears and cheers” on and around the 18th green. The Irish Daily Star took a similar tack with “Rory’s Masters peace”, reflecting the weight lifted off the 35-year-old’s shoulders.The New York Times reflected on the “roller coaster ride” on the final day – and the three that had preceded it – that had led McIlroy to victory, while the LA Times said: “Rory rose even higher”.

It filed the case in 2020 duringDonald Trump’s first term.The FTC seeks to force Meta to restructure or sell parts of its business including Instagram and WhatsApp. The trial poses the first major test for the FTC under the secondTrump administration. The agency began the investigation that led to the trial during Trump’s first term.Legal Defense Fund exits Meta civil rights advisory group over DEI changesRead moreJennifer Newstead, Meta’s chief legal officer, called the case weak and a deterrent to tech investment in a blogpost on Sunday.“It’s absurd that the FTC is trying to break up a great American company at the same time the Administration is trying to save Chinese-owned TikTok,” she wrote.The case poses an existential threat to Meta, which by some estimates earns about half of its US advertising revenue from Instagram, while also giving the public its first real measure of how strongly the newTrump administrationwill follow up on its promises to take on big tech.LosingInstagramwould be a devastating blow to Meta, said Jasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at market research firm Emarketer.“It would also severely damage its future user and revenue growth prospects,” Enberg said. “Instagram is now Meta’s biggest money maker in the US, its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company’s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack forFacebookon the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time.”Meta has been making regular overtures to Trump since his election, nixing content moderation policies Republicans said amounted to censorship and donating $1m to Trump’s inauguration. Meta’s CEO,Mark Zuckerberg, has also visited the White House multiple times in recent weeks. Zuckerberg has also purchased a new $23m mansion in DC that would “allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership”, a company spokesperson toldPolitico. The billionaire’s companydonated $1mto Trump’s inaugural committee and has unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the president to settle the case against Meta duringmeetings at the White House.“The Trump-Vance FTC could not be more ready for this trial,” said an FTC spokesperson, Joe Simonson, adding: “We are blessed with some of the most hardworking and intelligent lawyers in the country who are working around the clock.”Zuckerberg is expected to testify at the trial, where he will face questioning about emails in which he proposed acquiring the photo-sharing app Instagram as a way to neutralize a potential Facebook competitor and expressed worry that the encrypted messaging serviceWhatsAppcould grow into a social network.Meta has argued in court papers that its purchases of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 have benefited users, and that Zuckerberg’s past statements are no longer relevant amid fierce competition from ByteDance’s TikTok, Google’s YouTube and Apple’s messaging app.How users spend time on social media, and whether they consider the services interchangeable, will be core to the case. Meta will point to an increase in traffic to Instagram and Facebook duringTikTok’s brief shutdownin the United States in January as evidence of competition, according to court records.The FTC claims Meta holds a monopoly on platforms used to share with friends and family, where its main competitors in the United States are Snap’s Snapchat and MeWe, a tiny privacy-focused social media app launched in 2016. Platforms where users broadcast content to strangers based on shared interests, such as X, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit, are not interchangeable, the FTC has argued.The trial could have far-reaching consequences for the social media industry, according to Forrester’s vice-president of research, Mike Proulx.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We haven’t seen anything like this since around 2006-2011 – social media’s earliest days. We’d likely see a renaissance of social media startups looking to grab a piece of new social media world order.”The US district judge James Boasberg said in a ruling in November that while the FTC has enough evidence to move forward, the agency “faces hard questions about whether its claims can hold up in the crucible of trial”.The formerFTC chair Lina Khan saidthat Meta resorted to a “buy-or-bury scheme” when it was acquiring players such as Instagram and WhatsApp – if the company could not beat a competitor, it would either acquire the firm or cut off access to Facebook’s network and features. The case was about “free and fair trade”, Khan said in an NBC interview.“There’s no expiration date when it comes to the illegality of the transaction,” Khan said. “I think there is a way in which the entire social networking ecosystem looks different today because Facebook was permitted to go out and make these acquisitions.”Gerry Adams considers suing Meta over alleged use of his books to train AIRead moreThe trial is scheduled to stretch into July. If the FTC wins, it would have to prove at a second trial that measures such as forcing Meta to sell Instagram or WhatsApp would restore competition.Losing Instagram in particular could prove catastrophic to Meta’s bottom line.While Meta does not release app-specific revenue figures, Emarketer forecast in December that Instagram would generate $37.13bn this year, a little over half of Meta’s US ad revenue.WhatsApp to date has contributed only a sliver to Meta’s total revenue, but it is the company’s biggest app in terms of daily users and ramping up efforts to earn money off tools including chatbots.

It says it is working hard to fix this, but that industry-wide collaboration and government intervention are needed.Describing itself as “the ultimate virtual universe”, Roblox features millions of games and interactive environments, known collectively as “experiences”. Some of the content is developed by Roblox, but much of it is user-generated. In 2024, the platform had more than 85 million daily active users, an estimated 40% of whom are under 13.While the company said it “deeply sympathised” with parents whose children came to harm on the platform, it said “tens of millions of people have a positive, enriching and safe experience on Roblox every day”.However, inan investigation shared with the Guardian, the digital-behaviour experts Revealing Reality discovered “something deeply disturbing … a troubling disconnect between Roblox’s child-friendly appearance and the reality of what children experience on the platform”.View image in fullscreenA young Roblox user customises her avatar.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersRevealing Reality created multiple Roblox accounts, registering them to fictional users aged five, nine, 10, 13 and 40-plus. The accounts interacted only with one another, and not with users outside the experiment, to ensure their avatars’ behaviours were not influenced in any way.Despitenew tools launched last weekaimed at giving parents more control over their children’s accounts, the researchers concluded: “Safety controls that exist are limited in their effectiveness and there are still significant risks for children on the platform.”The report found that children as young as five were able to communicate with adults while playing games on the platform, and found examples of adults and children interacting with no effective age verification. This was despite Roblox changing its settings last November so that accounts listed as belonging to under-13s can no longer directly message others outside of games or experiences, instead having access only to public broadcast messages.The report also found the avatar belonging to the 10-year-old’s account could access “highly suggestive environments”. These included a hotel space where they could view a female avatar wearing fishnet stockings gyrating on a bed and other avatars lying on top of each other in sexually suggestive poses, and a public bathroom space where characters were urinating and avatars could choose fetish accessories to dress up in.1:00Club role-play hangout open to 10-year-old avatars – videoResearchers found that their test avatars overheard conversations between other players verbalising sexual activity, as well as repeated slurping, kissing and grunting noises, when using the voice chat function. Roblox says that all voice chat – which is available to phone-verified accounts registered as belonging to users aged 13 and above – is subject to real-time AI moderation.They also found that a test avatar registered to an adult was able to ask for the five-year-old test avatar’s Snapchat details using barely coded language. Though Roblox says in-game text chat is subject to built-in filters and moderation, the report says this is an example of how easily such measures can be circumvented, creating opportunities for predatory behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We continually evolve our policies, technologies, and moderation efforts to protect our community, especially young people. This includes investing in advanced safety tools, working closely with experts and empowering parents and caregivers with robust controls and resources.“In 2024 alone, we added more than 40 new safety enhancements, and we remain fully committed to going further to make Roblox a safe and civil place for everyone.”Explore more on these topicsChildren's techInternet safetyGamesOnline multiplayer gamesChildrenParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

US stock markets wereexpected to stage a recovery after the announcement. Shares in Apple and chip maker Nvidia were on course to soar after tariffs on their products imported into the US were lifted for 90 days.China’s commerce ministry said the exemption demonstrated the US taking “a small step toward correcting its erroneous unilateral practice of ‘reciprocal tariffs’,” and insisted Washington cancel the whole tariff regime.Zhang Li, president of the China Center for Information Industry Development, told state media outlet, China Daily, that the exemptions proved “how important China is to major US tech companies that rely heavily on the country for manufacturing and innovation”.However, Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said on Sunday that critical technology products from China would face separate new duties along with semiconductors within the next two months.Lutnick said Trump would enact “a special focus-type of tariff” on smartphones, computers and other electronics products in a month or two, alongside sectoral tariffs targeting semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. The new duties would fall outside Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs on China, he said.“He’s saying they’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick said in an interview on ABC, predicting that the levies would bring production of those products to the United States. “These are things that are national security, that we need to be made in America.”The world’s two largest economies have been locked in a fast-moving game of brinkmanship since Trump launched a global tariff assault that particularly targeted Chinese imports. China’s leader Xi Jinping said on Monday that protectionism “leads nowhere” and that a trade war would have “no winners”.Tit-for-tat exchanges have seen US levies imposed on China rise to 145%, andBeijing setting a retaliatory 125%levy on US imports. On Friday Beijing saidit would ignore any future raisesin tariffs by Trump, as they were already so high that there was “no market acceptance for US goods” in China.On Monday a spokesperson for China’s Customs agency said the country’s exports were facing a complex and severe external situation but “the sky will not fall”. They said China’s domestic demand was broad, and they were building a diversified market.Trump’s back-and-forth on tariffs has triggered the wildest swings on Wall Street since the Covid pandemic of 2020. The benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 index is down more than 10% since Trump took office on 20 January.After announcing sweeping import taxes on dozens of trade partners,Trump abruptly issued a 90-day pause for most of them. China was excluded from the reprieve.The fallout from Trump’s tariffs – and subsequent whiplash policy reversals – sent shock waves through the US economy, with investors dumping government bonds, the dollar tumbling and consumer confidence plunging.US senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, criticised the latest revision to Trump’s tariff plan, which economists have warned could dent economic growth and fuel inflation.“There is no tariff policy – only chaos and corruption,” Warren said on ABC’s “This Week,” speaking before Trump’s latest post on social media.China has sought to strengthen ties with neighbouring countries amid the escalating trade war.Xi will visit Vietnam on Mondayas he begins a tour of south-east Asia.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsDonald TrumpSmartphonesTariffsUS politicsChinaUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

I think he was lonely, thought this was a genuine friend, and we think he was given gifts on Roblox that made him feel special. It was really every parent’s worst nightmare.”David was among parents from around the world who shared with the Guardian that their children, often of primary school age, had been profoundly negatively affected by gaming on Roblox or had come to serious harm. Many alsoconfirmed the findings of a report last yearthat claimed Roblox was exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and abusive speech.Although some parents said Roblox had been a creative outlet for their children, brought them joy or even improved some of their skills, such as communication and spelling, the vast majority of parents who got in touch expressed severe concerns. These were mostly about staggering levels of addiction they had observed in their children, but also about instances of traumatising content in games their children could access despite parental controls, grooming, emotional blackmail, bullying, extreme political imagery such as avatars in Nazi uniforms, and strangers talking inappropriately to their children on the platform.“Deeply disturbing” researchby the digital behaviour experts Revealing Realityfound children as young as five were able to communicate with adults while playing games on the platform.Roblox acknowledged in response that children playing on the platform may be exposed to harmful content and “bad actors”, an issue the company claimed it was working hard to fix but that required industry-wide collaboration and government intervention. While the company said it “deeply sympathise[d]” with parents whose children have had negative experiences on Roblox, it did not engage with parental concerns about child users experiencing severe gaming addiction.Afreshly announced series of additional safety tools, aimed at giving greater flexibility to parents to manage their children’s activity on the site, failed to convince many of the parents the Guardian spoke to.“I don’t think the changes will address my concerns,” said Emily, a mother from Hemel Hempstead.There is no real way of policing the age of players“The new features are helpful but won’t stop the children being able to access inappropriate or scary content. People are allowed to choose the age ratings of a game they’ve created and they will not always be appropriate or accurate. I don’t think Roblox does enough to guarantee the safety of younger children on the platform.”Her seven-year-old daughter, she said, was having trouble sleeping as a Roblox game had taken her to a room with an avatar that was introduced as “your dad” and then shot dead.Despite Roblox claiming it had introduced “new easy-to-use ‘remote management’ parental controls”, parents said they had found it extremely difficult to navigate the parental control settings, and said it would take hours to regularly review their child’s activity. It was also impossible to tell, many stressed, who was really behind a user name.“Although Roblox do monitor the type of language being used, such as profanity, there is no real way of policing the age of players and some users talk in code,” said a mother from Rhondda Cynon Taff, Wales, whose autistic seven-year-old son plays on Roblox regularly.The company stressed that it had made it a default setting last year that under 13s can no longer directly message others on Roblox outside of games or experiences.Roblox admitted however that it was struggling to verify the age of users, saying that “age verification for users under the age of 13 remains a wider industry challenge”.I didn’t allow her to befriend strangers. I thought this was enough but it wasn’tNelly*, a mother from Dublin in her 40s, said her nine-year-old daughter had just finished a course of play therapy to process sexual content she saw on Roblox that triggered panic attacks.“I thought it was OK to play,” she said. “I also didn’t allow her to befriend strangers. I thought this was enough but it wasn’t.“There was an area that she went into and people wore underwear and someone came in and lay down on her.”It’s a fixation from morning to nightMany parents felt Roblox was exploiting children’s “underdeveloped impulse control”, as one father put it, giving them constant nudges to gamble and stay on the platform, and prompting many children to lose interest in other activities in the real world.Jenna, from Birmingham,said two months after her children had started playing Roblox, their “whole lives [had] been taken over” by the platform, echoing the remarks of scores of other parents.“I feel like I’m living with two addicts,” she said. “If they aren’t playing, they want to watch videos about it … When they get told to come off it’s like you’re cutting them off from their last fix – shouting, arguments, sometimes pure rage.”Peter, 51, an artist from London and father of three boys, said his 14-year-old son had become so addicted to Roblox and his devices generally that he had become violent, and had on one occasion broken a window with his fist when the game had been switched off.“The people who run Roblox don’t give a shit that parents can’t control the game. We’ve tried everything and nothing has worked. We’re now in therapy,” he said.Roblox’s chief executivehas advised parentsto keep their kids off the platform if they feel worried. Maria, a mother of three from Berkshire, was among many who highlighted, however, that it was difficult for parents to do so as children felt socially excluded when they were offline, and that the platform’s monetisation elements – unlocking higher game levels and personalisation features – had become status symbols among children.Roblox said in a statement: “We deeply sympathise with the parents who described theirs and their kids’ negative experiences on Roblox. This is not what we strive for, and not reflective of the civil online space we want to build for everyone.“Tens of millions of people have a positive, enriching and safe experience on Roblox every day, in a supportive environment that promotes connecting with friends, learning and developing vital STEM skills. While we recognise that no safety system operating at scale is perfect, we work tirelessly to enhance and improve our systems, processes and policies.”*Name has been changedExplore more on these topicsInternet safetyChildrenGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

The Google project became known as Waymo in 2016.Any idea how many more years until we see the first self-driving taxis?They already have them in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix, among other places.You mean they’re testing the technology on actual roads?No, I mean you can get a Waymo to take you somewhere in San Francisco right now …It’s a miracle!… and also possibly offer you a job while you’re in there.Now that’s service.How does the technology behind the recruitment end of this whole thing work?It’s surprisingly lo-fi: someone riding in a Waymo left a handwritten note advertising some senior software engineer positions “to work on AI/music project”, along with the company website and an email address for applicants.Presuming that anyone getting into a driverless taxi would be precisely the kind of devil-may-care nerd they were looking for?Exactly.Did it work?The person who left the note, the Influur CEO Alessandra Angelini, says she received about 60 CVs as a result.I’m amazed 60 qualified applicants got into the same Waymo that day.That’s statistically unlikely, but someone who did hire the taxi took a pic of the note and posted it on social media, where it was viewed 300,000 times.So that’s how it works.Job offers aren’t the only advantage of driverless technology. Another rider left a note in a Waymo looking for a date, listing his age (26), his height (“5ft 10in on a good day”), other particulars (“runs marathons”) and a phone number.Didthatwork?He got 200 replies, but again, only because someone else posted a pic on social media.It seems this new recruitment system relies rather heavily on third parties withX accounts.Also, the taxis get cleaned pretty regularly, so your ad won’t last long.Will the novelty of this approach wear off once driverless taxis become commonplace?Probably. I mean, you wouldn’t respond to an ad for a date that somebody left in an Uber.Do say:“Enjoy the ride, and thank you for your application!”Don’t say:“Drivers wanted.”Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePass notesMotoringGooglefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the story of socially awkward freelance games journalist, Cameron Walker, who steals the code to a new virtual pet sim named Thronglets from the developer he’s meant to be interviewing. When he gets the game home, he realises the cute, intelligent little critters he’s caring for on the screen have a darker ambition than simply to perform for his amusement – cue nightmarish exploration of AI and our complicity in its rise.The episode is interesting to me because … well, I was a socially awkward games journalist in the mid-1990s. But more importantly, so was Charlie Brooker. He began his writing career penning satirical features and blistering reviews for PC Zone magazine, one of the two permanently warring PC mags of the era (I shared an office with the other, PC Gamer). In Plaything, it’s PC Zone that Cameron Walker writes for, and there are several scenes taking place in its office, which in the programme is depicted as a reasonably grownup office space with tidy computer workstations and huge windows. I do not think the production design team got this vision from Brooker.“Zone had far less of the corporate workplace feel than the episode showed, and much more of a kids in the basement, youth club-cum-nightclub vibe to it,” says Paul Presley, who worked on PC Zone at the time. “It was a handful of messy, cluttered desks stuck in a windowless basement office round the back of Oxford Street (later Tottenham Court Road). We’d have killed for floor-to-ceiling windows! Editorial, art and production were all on top of each other, music blasting from the office stereo, usually furnished by the neighbouring Metal Hammer magazine. Desks were personal spaces, overflowing with paper, mags, trinkets, swag and tons and tons of CDs.”In the sake of journalistic thoroughness, I also contacted another PC Zone alumnus Richie Shoemaker for his recollections. “Although there were windows along one side, they were below street level and smeared with London grime,” he says. “The sills were piled high with dusty magazines, broken joysticks and likely-empty game boxes. It was perpetual night for the best part of eight years down there.”View image in fullscreenKids in the basement … the office of PC Zone magazine in the mid-1990sPhotograph: Richie ShoemakerThe episode was more accurate on the games themselves – the first scene in the office shows Cam playing Doom, when the editor comes over, shows him the front cover of the latest issue of the mag with System Shock on the cover, then asks Cameron if he’s finished his review of Bullfrog’s classic adventure game Magic Carpet. “[Plaything] is good on the timelines,” says Shoemaker. “Playing Doom in the office was of course standard – although when I joined the team Quake was the lunchtime and afterwork deathmatch of choice. The Magic Carpet reviewdidappear in the issue after System Shock (which was actually Charlie’s first cover review), but it got 96%, not 93% and was written by launch editor Paul Lakin – who went on to work at the Foreign Office.” He also reckons the episode’s grizzled old editor might have been inspired by then deputy editor, Chris Anderson, who according to Shoemaker was “quite a vampiric character who seemed to exist on a diet of cigarettes and Ultima Online.”Most fascinating to me though is the inspirational origin of the Thronglets virtual pet game. Most reviewers have been referencing Tamagotchi, the keychain pet toy that took the world by storm int the late 90s. Brooker himself has referenced it in an interview. However, a much more likely candidate was the 1996 title Creatures, in which players cared for generations of cuddly-looking critters. Although it looked like a cutesy pet game it was in fact a highly sophisticated artificial life experiment, created by the distinctly sci-fi-sounding CyberLife Technology. Players needed to try to establish breeding populations of the creatures – called norns – but your control over them was limited as they were coded with advanced neural networks and had functioning internal bodily systems regulating their behaviours and physical abilities. CyberLife made a big deal of the complexity and experimental nature of the game: the box came with a warning sticker stating “Digital DNA Enclosed” and the blurb on the back cautioned players that they would be unleashing the world’s first artificial life-science experiment – which is exactly what Plaything is about.View image in fullscreenLess cutesy than it looked … Creatures.Photograph: CyberLife TechnologiesCreatures creator Steve Grand bears similarities to the Plaything (and Bandersnatch) coder Colin Ritman. He was a programmer who got tired of conventional games and wanted to try something extremely new. He went on to write a book about Creatures and its development, Creation: Life and How to Make It, and later became an internationally renowned roboticist, famously developing a robot orangutan. Surely the most Black Mirror career trajectory ever. In 2011, he started work on a spiritual follow-up to Creatures named Grandroids, which like Thronglets was about developing a race of intelligent AI aliens – Grand launched a Kickstarter for it in 2016. The project has yet to surface although Grand has a new website for it under the namePhantasia. All very intriguing.This is one of the things I love aboutBlack Mirror, and indeed the use of technology and video games in conventional drama: this is an arcane world full of eccentric people no one outside the industry has heard of, yet the toys they make have massive ramifications. Personally, I wanted to see a lot more of the PC Zone as imagined by the programme, but I understand that the sinister Thronglets were the real focus. Maybe one day there will be a full Silicon Valley-style drama series about the games industry in the 1990s – it was a hell of a time. For now, it’s interesting to see the world both Brooker and I inhabited being used as the venue for dystopian fiction – even if they really did get it completely wrong about those windows.Explore more on these topicsGamesBlack MirrorTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While student engagement and the addiction to phones and social media certainly need to be addressed, schools are more likely to support students’ development if they teach them how to use technology in ways that are healthy, purposeful and life-enhancing. A balanced, nuanced approach to phone use can still promote social interaction for children of all ages and encourage learning beyond the classroom.All students should be equipped to access quality information and transfer knowledge quicker in their pursuit of independent learning. If phones or tablets can help achieve that goal, maybe we should not be so quick to dismiss them in schools.Shouldn’t we instead aim to help students become confident in using digital devices in and out of school? How else will young people learn how to think critically and navigate online spaces filled with disinformation that is supercharged by artificial intelligence?Dr Robert HarrisonDirector of education and integrated technology,ACS International SchoolsDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

It was a tribute to Mr Schäuble’s extreme fiscal conservatism, which had delivered Germany’s first balanced budget in the postwar period. Amid resurgentprosperityin the Angela Merkel years, the so-called black zero – symbolising a constitutional prohibition on public debt – had gradually acquired cult status.As a new administration prepares to take power in Berlin, it seems unlikely that human euro signs will welcome the latest politician to take on Mr Schäuble’s former role. But in dramatic fashion, the spending taps are set to be turned on. Via a swiftly stagedMarch votein the outgoing Bundestag, “debt brake” dogma was consigned to history by the chancellor‑elect, Friedrich Merz. The way was thus paved for groundbreaking expenditure on defence, and the overhaul of an economy being left behind in a changed, suddenly menacing world.So much for the theory – now for the practice. Mr Merz, the centre-right leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), last weekconcludedthe fastest set of coalition talks since 2009. Pending approval of the deal by Social Democratic party (SPD) members, he is expected to be sworn in as chancellor in by early May. In office, the “grand coalition” agreed between the CDU and the SPD – handed seven ministries including finance and defence – will immediately be confronted by challenges that dwarf those faced by almost all its predecessors.The US under Donald Trump, whether as economic partner or military ally, can no longer berelied upon– an era-defining shift whatever the outcome of the current tariff wars and Mr Trump’s negotiations with Moscow over Ukraine. China, once a vast outlet for the exports which fuelled growth, has morphed into a fearsome competitor, including on German soil. A stagnant economy, combined with a post-Merkelbacklash against migration, has accelerated the rise of Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), one of the most extreme far‑right parties in Europe. Last week, a poll fatefully placed the AfD in the leadfor the first time.The pressure from the right – both from within his own party and from the AfD – is having an impact. Mr Merz’s Trumpianpromiseto turn asylum seekers away at German borders from his “first day”, along with other draconian measures, will only allow the far right to up the ante still further. Meanwhile, he also appears to be looking for wriggle room on agreed coalitioncommitmentsto the less well off and toclimate targets.Nevertheless, the broad economic thrust of the deal remains right for troubling times. The European Central Bank must play its part – by keepingyieldson a leash. As Germany’s neighbours deal with similar geopolitical threats and uncertainties, the ability of the EU’s most powerful member state to show leadership and forge a path through the crisis will be crucial. With short-term growth acutely vulnerable to mood swings in the White House, the effects of spending will take time to be felt in people’s everyday lives. But the prospect of a transformative increase in public investment offers the hope of industrial renaissance and a restoration of voters’ trust in thepolitical centre.Alongside his SPD counterparts last week, Mr Merz confidentlyannouncedthat Germany was “back on track”. Europe badly needs him to be right.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That leaves two key questions for Ukraine’s European alliesDavid Shimer was the director for eastern Europe and Ukraine on Joe Biden’s National Security CouncilMon 14 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 13.31 EDTShareThe war between Russia andUkraineis approaching a historic turning point: unless the Trump administration adjusts course, US military aid for Ukraine is about to cease.In the months before leaving office, Joe Biden made a series of decisions to augment Ukraine’s stockpiles of vital munitions. Toward the end of 2024, the Department of Defense surged hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of rockets and hundreds of armored vehicles to Ukraine, and that December, he approved an additional $1.25bn security assistance package for Ukraine, which has enabled the continued flow of US arms ever since (with the exception of thedamaging pauseordered by DonaldTrump in March).These decisions bought Ukraine time, but that time is running out. Ukraine is depleting its stockpiles of US munitions. The $1.25bn aid package will soon be exhausted. The United States still possesses several billion dollars in drawdown authority, which could be used to send Ukraine additional security assistance. But since taking office, Trump has not approved a single military aid package for Ukraine. Even if Trump were to reverse course and utilize this remaining drawdown authority, the amount available is insufficient to sustain US support for Ukraine over time. To do that, Congress would need to approve additional Ukraine funding, which will not happen while the Republican party controls both chambers and the White House. As a result, the era of US military aid to Ukraine is approaching its end.Trump was ‘the candidate of peace’. Now he’s fanning the flames of war | Mohamad BazziRead moreVladimir Putin is stalling the Trump administration’s ineffective pursuit of a ceasefire as he waits for Biden-era military aid deliveries to run dry. Over the weekend, shortly after the Russian presidentmet withthe US representative Steve Witkoff, the Russian militarylauncheda horrifying ballistic missile attack in Sumy that killed dozens of Ukrainian civilians. Putin is biding his time, eager to see whether the Ukrainian army will buckle in the absence of US military aid. As hesaid recently: “There are reasons to believe that we will finish them off.” Even if Russia is unable to capture much more territory, Putin will still wait for Ukraine’s position to become significantly more desperate before making any serious decisions about an end to this war. As US military aid for Ukraine winds down, North Korea, Iran and China are likely to continue, and could decide to increase, their support for Russia.Putin is planning for this war to continue for at least months longer. Russia faces its own challenges: Ukrainian forces continue to fight effectively and to imposeextraordinary costson the Russian military, and falling oil prices will place further strain on the Russian economy. Even so, Grigory Karasin, Russia’s representative in talks with the Trump administration, has indicated publicly that ceasefire negotiations will progress slowly over the course of this year. The US should be seeking to adjust Putin’s calculus – and to push him to engage in meaningful negotiations – by surging security assistance to Ukraine and intensifying sanctions against Russia. But regrettably, the Trump administration has done neither of those things, opting instead to pressure Volodomyr Zelenskyy and to make unilateral concessions to Russia.European leaders have stepped up in recent months to try to help Ukraine survive in the absence of US leadership. European discussions about a postwar reassurance force are important, but the actual war is still ongoing, and further planning is needed to deal with the impending loss of US material support.The key questions for Ukraine’s European backers are twofold: how can Ukraine persist with a combination of its own domestic production of weapons, European security assistance, and USintelligence sharing?; and what is the most viable pathway to finance this support?As a baseline, European countries should accept more risk tolerance in donating their own military equipment to Ukraine. Many European governments maintain significant stockpiles of artillery, rockets and air defense; given the stakes of this war, more of those capabilities should be provided to Ukraine. Meanwhile, these same European countries should increase defense spending to replenish their depleted weapons stockpiles over the longer term.Second, Europe should direct more resources into Ukraine’s innovative defense industrial base. Ukraine is producing cutting-edge drones, munitions and air defense capabilities that are reducing, though not eliminating, its reliance on external security assistance. Now is the time to finance Ukraine’s indigenous production of weapons, which are helping to blunt Russian assaults across the front.Third, the United Kingdom and France – as leaders in their support for Ukraine – should try to strike a deal with the Trump administration to secure additional air defense missiles for Ukraine. During the Biden administration, the United States diverted its air defense exports so that they would go to Ukraine first. A coalition of European governments led by France and the UK should attempt to negotiate an agreement with the White House to continue this policy – with the understanding that the Europeans will foot the bill. Under this arrangement, participating European countries would purchase AMRAAM and Patriot missiles for Ukraine off US production lines, and the Department of Defense would prioritize those purchases given Ukraine’s acute and ongoing air defense requirements. Trump may refuse this offer, but there is no downside to making the pitch, which, if successful, could be broadened to cover additional US defense exports that Ukraine needs.Fourth, the European countries supporting Ukraine will need to decide how to pay for all of this. One option is to dig into their own budgets. The other, more sustainable option is for Europe to seize the approximately $300bn in Russian sovereign assets currently immobilized in their jurisdictions. Those assets can be used to finance Ukraine’s defense industry, procure weapons from the US and around the world, and support the Ukrainian economy for years to come. Strategically, those assets would provide Zelenskyy with a durable source of non-US assistance, which would reduce Zelenskyy’s dependency on the US and increase his leverage in any negotiations to end the war. Many legal and policy experts have put forward strong arguments to justify seizure and to mitigate associated risks to the European economy. The costs of inaction today far outweigh the manageable risks of asset seizure.The realities of our current moment are both clear and regrettable: Putin has shown no indication that he will agree to a ceasefire, so this war will continue, and the end of US security assistance is approaching. Europe should move quickly to pursue the above steps and help save Ukraine from the coming storm.David Shimer served on the White House national security council from 2021-25, including as the director for eastern Europe and Ukraine and as director for Russian affairs.

Both relished disruption and have exploited the power of the mobMon 14 Apr 2025 05.38 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 14.15 EDTShareWhen rare protests flared in China in 2022,one slogan read: “We want reform, not a Cultural Revolution.” It alluded to complaints that the country’s leader, Xi Jinping, was behaving in an increasingly Mao-esque manner. His extraordinary dominance over his party, political repression, tight social controls and burgeoning personality cult all lent themselves to comparison with the man who ruled China for decades.Yet Xi is committed to order and discipline, exerting authority through the organs of the Communist party. Mao Zedong relished disruption and turned to the power of the masses. That’s why, increasingly, many in China are comparing Mao to another modern-day leader. Despite the ferocity of Donald Trump’s trade war, they are perhaps just as shocked by what he is doing to his own country. They see a proud nation felled not by an external threat, but by the unbridled ego of the man at the top – a vengeful, anarchic force who uses dramatic rhetoric to whip up the mob and destroy institutions, and unpredictability to reinforce his power. It looks awfully familiar.In onewidely circulated essayon US politics, the legal scholar Zhang Qianfan calls it “America’s Cultural Revolution”. Instead of tightly controlling everything, as Xi and other strongmen prefer, Trump sees opportunities in upheaval. Like Mao, preparing to unleash the Cultural Revolution almost 60 years ago, he appears to believe that a brighter future will be reached through “great disorder under heaven”.Obviously, the analogy can only go so far. The decade-long Cultural Revolution saw perhaps 2 million people killed or hounded to their deaths and tens of millions persecuted in acts of extraordinary cruelty. It destroyed much of China’s culture, closed schools and universities, silenced its greatest thinkers and tore families apart. No one elected Mao, and without a palace coup there was no way to remove him. The US has powerful checks and balances and free speech protections. This is about resonance, not repetition.But even before Trump won office, the writer Jiayang Fannotedthe two men’s “polemical excess andxenophobic paranoia”. In 2017, the sinologist Geremie Barmé’slengthy comparisonargued that Mao too “portrayed himself as an outsider who championed an uprising of the masses against a sclerotic system”.As I researched Red Memory, my book on how the Cultural Revolution stillshapes and scars China, Trump’s uncanny ability to channel the public’s id felt disconcertingly familiar. Like Mao, he amplifies political power by dividing where other leaders promise to unite. Mao said that the “most important question” of the revolution was: “Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?” Therhetoric of divisionhas been central to rallying support for Trump, andhe portraysan “enemy from within, [which] in my opinion, is more dangerous than China, Russia, and all those countries”.Therevolutionary natureof Trump’s second term only strengthens the case. Mao launched the Cultural Revolution after his disastrous Great Leap Forward: a hubristic economic plan that led to as many as 45 million deaths from famine before more pragmatic figures reined him in. He wanted revenge and the removal of doubters unwilling to pursue his next implausible goal. “We can observe a purer Trump exactly as [the Cultural Revolution] revealed a purer Mao,”writesMichel Bonnin, a leading expert on the Cultural Revolution. The president, too, has shaken off restraints.Many on the right loathe these comparisons, however qualified, and not only because of the era’s brutality or the shock of seeing their hero compared to China’s most famous communist. They (and, in fairness, some Chinese survivors) argue that the Cultural Revolution is better compared to US campus protests in recent years, casting intolerant students as modern Red Guards.But even if you share their disapproval of protesters, the comparison doesn’t hold. The Red Guards were Mao’s means to Mao’s end, born of his cult and able to run riot only with his support and encouragement. As Prof Zhang writes in his essay: “Essentially, the Cultural Revolution means the supreme leader orchestrating a mass movement … harnessing ordinary citizens to root out disobedient elites.”Thedocument launching the Cultural Revolutionwarned that (counter-revolutionary) “revisionists” had “sneaked into the party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles”. The Trump administrationrails against “revisionists”(of the left) who have gained influence within national institutions. Trump has replaced seasoned professionals with destructive ideologues, rendering parts of the state unable to function. His dislike of experts recalls an era in which loyalty and political attitude – “redness” – were more important than technical knowhow. We are urged to “trust the president’s instincts” as the global economy shudders. Chinese citizens were once told to “just follow” Mao’s instructions, including “those we fail to understand for the moment”.Leaders around Mao were often startled to learn his intentions from state media; Trump’s cabinet is caught out by Truth Social posts. Like Mao, Trump makes ambiguous or contradictory statements, then sits back and watches underlingstake chunks out of each other. He’s even showing a hitherto undetected interest in culture, taking over theKennedy Center(though Melania, as yet, shows no desire to produce Trumpistmodel operas).What lessons might the US take from one of the grimmest parts of Chinese history? The first is that Mao was able to wreak havoc because those around him feared his often lethal wrath and did not fully comprehend his vision’s extremity until it was too late. Republicans, business leaders and others can challenge Trump, yet still choose not to do so.The second is that nothing lasts for ever. The Cultural Revolution limped to a close with Mao’s death in 1976. What followed was an extraordinary social, cultural, economic and even political flourishing. While democratic impulses were never allowed to take root, traces of that era’s hope and creativity endure to this day, despite Beijing’s best efforts.If that can happen even in a one-party system then perhaps, post-Trumpism, something better awaits. Yet China is still paying the political, social and psychological price for Mao’s folly and ruthlessness. The longer such a campaign rages, the greater the damage done.Tania Branigan is foreign leader writer for the Guardian and author ofRed Memory: The Afterlives of China’s Cultural RevolutionDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was a long time ago – during a debate about whether the US should intervene in a foreign conflict – and I have never forgotten it. What they meant was that just as the US is condemned for foreign intervention in some instances, it is also called upon to do so in others and then judged for not upholding its moral standards. That dissonance persists, and is even more jarring as we approach the 100th day of Donald Trump’s second term. There is a duality to how the US is seen: as both a country that wantonly violates international law and as the only one capable of upholding that system of law and order. This duality, always tense, is no longer sustainable.I have felt this ambivalence myself – the contradictory demand that the US stay out of it but also anger that it is not doing more.In Sudan, Washington frustratingly refuses to pressure its ally, the UAE, into stopping pumping arms and funding into the conflict. But what proof or history is there to support the delusional notion that the US cares about a conflict in which it has no direct interest? It is an expectation of moral policing from an amoral player that I remember even in childhood, after Iraq invaded Kuwait and the Arab world was rocked with fear of regional war. A fierce debate in our classroom in Sudan on the merits of US intervention was silenced by one indignant evacuee from Kuwait, who said that the most important thing was to defeat Saddam Hussein. Her words occasionally echo in my mind: “We must deal with the greater evil first.”Even in Gaza, as Congress passed package after package of billions in military aid to Israel, there remained some residual hope – long extinguished now – that the phone call to Benjamin Netanyahu would finally come. And even as Trump emboldens Vladimir Putin,abandons Ukraineand slaps tariffs on allies, you can detect that belief in the fundamental viability of the US as an actor that can still default to rationality, and even morality.The ‘new world order’ of the past 35 years is being demolished before our eyes. This is how we must proceed | Gordon BrownRead moreBut, for the first time that I can remember, the conversation is going in a new direction. The appeals to the difference between the presidency and other more solid US institutions are quieter now, as universities, law firms and even parts of the press kowtow to their erratic new king. The questions now being asked are about how Europe and the rest of the world can pivot away from the US, from its USAID programmes nestled within the health budgets of developing countries, and its global system of military assistance and deterrence. But they sound less like practical suggestions and more like attempts to get heads around a reality that is impossible to countenance.The challenge is technical and psychological. It is difficult to imagine a post-American world because America crafted that world. When the US becomes a volatile actor, the very architecture of the global financial order starts to wobble. We saw this in thecrisis of confidencein the dollar in the aftermath of Trump’s “liberation-day” tariffs. The robustness of the rule of law and separation of powers – cornerstones of confidence in an economy – are also now in doubt, as the administration goes to war with its own judiciary and thepresident himself boasts abouthow many people in the room with him made a killing out of his stock market crash. Is it insider trading if your source is the president?Just as formidable is the mental task of divestment from the US. A friend who holds a green card but lives under an illiberal regime in Asia told me that, deep down, he always felt protected from the dangers of his country’s domestic politics by the knowledge that there was a safe haven to which he could retreat in case of persecution. No longer,aslegal residentsand visitors arehounded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement(Ice) or turned away at the border. I know others who have cancelled work trips to the US for fear of deportation or blacklisting. With that insecurity comes an awareness that, for some in the global south who always knew that the US was not a benign presence, there was still the belief that there was something within its own borders that curbed its excesses. This was partly true, but also a reflection of US cultural power. The pursuit of liberty and the pursuit of happiness, “give me … your huddled masses”, the Obama hope iconography; all resonant and powerful touchstones. They are now reduced to dust. It is one thing to know that the US was never the sum of these parts, but another to accept it.And there is a fear in accepting it. Because, for all its violations, the advent of a post-US world induces a feeling of vertigo. A world in which there is no final authority at all might be scarier than a world where there is a deeply flawed one. What is daunting is the prospect of anarchy, a new world where there is no organising principle in a post-ideological, everyone-for-themselves system. Not a cold war order divided into capitalist, communist and non-aligned. And not a post-cold war one divided into western liberal overlords, competing non-democracies and, below them, smaller clients of both.But what the US’s breakdown should really trigger is not overwhelm and bewilderment, but a project to build a new global order in which we all have a stake. What the US chooses to do in terms of foreign and economic policy can affect your shopping basket and the very borders of the nation state in which you live. It remains the world’s largest economy, has the world’s largest military, and is the home of the world’s most powerful entertainment complex. This centrality combined with its collapse reveals the fact that the problem goes deeper than Trump. The world was always dangerously overexposed to whatever direction the US took.Ironically, this all might be the beginning of a process that leads to genuine “liberation days” for other countries, but not the US itself. There is pain ahead, but also a sort of independence. Above all, there might finally be a recognition that the US’s definition of peace and prosperity was always its own, enforced by sheer force of power and propaganda.Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But unfunny and mean will always die a deathMon 14 Apr 2025 11.14 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 11.32 EDTShareIn these partisan times, when all is binary and everyone must pick a side, I have chosen mine. Aimee Lou Wood, she of The White Lotus and thus now instantly recognisable worldwide, is absolutely right to call out Saturday Night Live, the legendary US entertainment and satire show,for making jokes about her teeth. The special relationship is under enough strain without having to lean into old stereotypes about British gnashers. I am still reeling from theBig Book of British Smilesgag in The Simpsons and I continue to floss every day because of it.The SNL joke, if you are yet to see it, is part of a wider sketch making fun of the Trump administration. (Because if one thing has been proven to quell the march of the right, it’s parody.) A White Lotus character is mashed up with someone adjacent to Robert F Kennedy, he mentions fluoride, and a Wood-esque character says “What’s that?”It’s a funny joke, initially, because if one thing has transcendedThe White Lotus, it’s Wood’s smile. I haven’t seen The White Lotus myself. But I know three things about it. It’s set in Thailand, Arnie Schwarzenegger’s son is in it, and one of its main talking points has been the gaps between her teeth.However, it’s not a funny joke when you pull at its threads. Firstly, fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that is added to toothpaste and water because it helps keep teeth healthy. The premise of the joke, therefore, is that Wood’s teeth are unhealthy, which they absolutely are not. The joke is fundamentally dishonest and as a result, that initial laugh is followed by the shame of punching down at someone who is the star of a worldwide TV smash hit.Secondly, if British people do have “bad” teeth, it’s not because of a lack of fluoride, of which we are full to the brim. Heck, I think they even put it in our cider now. It’s because of a NHS that provides dentistry through contracts known asgeneral dental servicesthat are really complicated and thought of as not fit for purpose. It’s easier to find someone who will give you a free check-up of your gut health than it is to find someone to look into your mouth. But then it’s hard to tell a joke with that premise in three seconds.Wood saw the show, took to social media, and dubbed the skit “mean and unfunny”. There’s a lot there to unpack. Some jokes are funny, some are mean, some are funny and mean and, as Wood says, some are mean and unfunny. That’s the area best avoided.As someone who professionally mines funny, I think the lines in comedy aren’t that complicated. If you’re telling the truth, and your angle is clever enough, the joke is worth telling. If the joke only works if you turn a blind eye to the fact it is based on a fallacy, it is probably something that should remain on a Post-it note on a writers’ room wall. But, if these poor-taste gags sometimes escape, they serve to remind us that comedy writers aren’t perfect, cultural vacuums confuse actualities with bias, and the right to reply that famous people have means that this kind of transgression is not something you can get away with.At the end of the day, the skit told us more about the American obsession with having Tippex-white teeth as straight as Trump’s golf swing than it did Wood’s teeth. For that reason, she’s completely right to call them out. But here’s another thing for the SNL writers to consider: if we’re talking today about depictions of Wood’s teeth, and not the other points they were trying to make – about antivaxxers, illegal deportations, nonsensical tariffs and a collapsing economy – they appear to have missed the target. And in that case, the other victim is satire itself.Athena Kugblenu is a writer and comedianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the real shift came when she stopped trying to force sleepThe modern mindis a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their workMon 14 Apr 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 19.13 EDTShareChloe had always been a night owl. As a teenager, she spent hours staring at the ceiling, willing herself to sleep. By university, she accepted that her body simply didn’t work like everyone else’s. While her friends collapsed into bed after long days of lectures and socialising, Chloe remained wired – her mind restless, her body tense.At first, she found ways to cope. She convinced herself she was more productive at night, using the extra hours to study, read or scroll endlessly through her phone. But as she entered her late 20s, the exhaustion became unbearable. No matter how early she went to bed, she would lie awake for hours, her thoughts racing. She tried herbal teas, white noise and meditation apps. She cut out caffeine and phone use before bed. Nothing worked.“I thought I had a broken sleep cycle,” she said. “I couldn’t understand why my body refused to rest.”James thought he was just stressed – then the panic attacks started | Diane YoungRead moreIt wasn’t until she started therapy that she began to uncover a deeper truth: her insomnia wasn’t just a quirk of biology – it was a symptom of something she had spent years avoiding.The link between trauma and sleepInsomnia and other poor sleep patterns can have serious implications for health and general wellbeing and may lead to trouble with learning, memory, concentration and feeling irritable. Persistent issues with sleep may also affect our general health and cause problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, stroke and depression.Research increasingly shows insomnia can be linked to unresolved trauma, particularly childhood adversity. The body’s ability to switch off and enter restorative sleep is deeply tied to its stress response. If a person grows up in an unpredictable or unsafe environment, their nervous system can remain on high alert, long after the danger has passed.We refer to it as hypervigilance, a characteristic of both PTSD and childhood trauma, which can impact a person’s capacity to relax and find restfulness to allow for sleep to follow. This hypervigilant state has us caught in a loop of overthinking during the night with little capacity to stop the intrusive thoughts. It is our brain’s way of seeking safety when we may not actually be in harm’s way.For Chloe, childhood had been a minefield of tension. Raised in a home where conflict was constant and unpredictable, she had learned to be hyperaware of shifts in mood and tone. Nights, in particular, were fraught. “I never knew what version of my parents I was going to get,” she said. “If I heard footsteps outside my door, my whole body would tense up.”As her therapist I explained that this kind of vigilance doesn’t just disappear with age. The body internalises it, keeping the nervous system in a state of heightened alertness – especially at night, when vulnerability is highest. In short, Chloe’s insomnia wasn’t a failure of her body. It was her body trying to protect her, long after she needed it to.Stop trying to force sleepUnderstanding the root of her sleep issues didn’t fix them overnight, but it changed the way Chloe approached them. Instead of berating herself for failing to fall asleep, she started to acknowledge the fear that lay beneath it.I spent four decades not sleeping a wink – until a doctor took my insomnia seriouslyRead moreShe worked on creating a sense of safety in her night-time routine. Small things helped – soft lighting and a gentle wind-down period with calming music instead of screens. But the real shift came when she stopped trying to force sleep and instead focused on soothing her nervous system.“I came to appreciate that I was attempting to control the experience of sleep rather than being self-compassionate and allowing my body to rest,” she said. Rather than pressuring herself to sleep, Chloe gave herself the permission she needed to “just rest”. After that, she noticed that she would be woken by her alarm rather than lying sleepless for hours on end.She also learned to reframe her relationship with rest. “For so long, sleep felt like something I had to conquer,” she said. “Now I see it as something I deserve.”Healing beyond sleepWhile Chloe’s insomnia hasn’t vanished entirely, she no longer sees it as an unsolvable mystery. Instead, it has become a guide, a signal that her body still holds tension she needs to address.“There’s no quick fix,” she said. “But now, when I can’t sleep, I ask myself: what am I holding on to? What does my body need from me?”For years, Chloe thought she was just bad at sleeping. Now she understands that her body was never failing her – it was trying to keep her safe. And in learning to listen, she’s finally giving herself the rest she always needed.*All clients discussed are fictional amalgamsLeanne Schubert is a family therapist and director of inpatient and day programs atSouth Pacific Private, a treatment centre for mental health, trauma and addictionIn Australia, support is available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636,Lifelineon 13 11 14, and atMensLineon 1300 789 978.

Take what we know about exercise. Just in the past few months, we’ve learned that moderate exercise mayalmost halvethe risk of postpartum depression for new mothers, and that even five minutes of exercise a day could helplower blood pressure.But what really caught my eye recently was a study from Latin America that included roughly 10,000 people who were assessed over two decades using the Mexico City prospective study. The research,published inthe British Journal of Sports Medicine, examined cognitive function with the aim of understanding the impact of exercise on mental ability, including mild dementia. The researchers took account of confounding variables such as age, diet, smoking and alcohol intake, nightly sleep and educational attainment, which have all been shown to affect overall health and wellbeing. By controlling for these factors, the contribution of physical activity towards mild cognitive impairment was estimated.The study found that “weekend warriors” – that is people who exercise only once or twice a week – were 25% less likely to develop mild dementia than those who didn’t exercise at all; while those who were regularly active (at least three times a week) were 11% less likely. The authors of the study didn’t address why weekend warriors actually fared better than regular exercisers, but focused on the big picture: they estimate that13% of mild dementia cases could be avoided if all middle-aged adults exercised at least once or twice a week.While we have known about the benefits of physical activity for physical health, such as preventing diabetes and hypertension, for a long time, newer research is pointing to the positive effects on our minds. As a personal trainer, I’m used to telling individual clients and classes how we can make certain muscles “stronger”. But people should also be encouraged to think more expansively about what’s going on – to visualise their muscles producing small proteins travelling up to their brain to protect neural matter. This is what makes us feel happy and helps delay mild dementia. Referred to as “muscle-brain cross-talk”, exercise has increasingly been prescribed as aneffective intervention for depression.Lowering bad cholesterol may cut risk of dementia by 26%, study suggestsRead moreThe latest analysis on mild dementia and exercise is exciting to read because it shows that you don’t have to do huge amounts of exercise – punishing daily regimes – to reap significant benefits to your health. So stop stressing if you can’t, or don’t want to, get up at 6am to exercise before work each day, or can’t make it to the gym in the evening because you prefer to see your friends or family. You can also look at your overall fitness plan, if you have one, in a weekly block, rather than being guilty if a few days go by when you’re not able to fit in movement. How active are you over seven days, and where can you add in enjoyable and easy ways to get moving – whether it’s a Sunday morning jog or a Saturday afternoon swim?Those of us in the physical activity community often think about optimising fitness – what is the best exercise, compound set of moves, or new hack to introduce? But this incremental fixation, which is really about the fit becoming fitter, and tinkering around the edges, misses the bigger picture: the wider public health challenge of getting those who are inactive, or feel like they’re not sporty, to get moving. So three cheers to the researchers in Mexico City if it’s the incentive you need – even just a little bit of exercise can go a long way.Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, and the author ofHow Not to Die (Too Soon)Explore more on these topicsDementiaOpinionFitnessHealthHealth & wellbeingMedical researchcommentShareReuse this content"

And yet, in one of the wealthiest parts of the country, this is the daily reality for far too many families.Since being elected as MP for Kensington and Bayswater last year, I have been contacted more about housing than any other issue. More than half of the people who get in touch with my office want my help with housing problems: homes riddled with damp and mould; residents left waiting months – sometimes years – for basic repairs; people placed in temporary accommodation miles from their communities. The scale of the problem is enormous, and the damage is having a real impact on people’s lives.As we approach the eighth anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people in the community I now serve, we are still confronting the same culture that led to the tragedy: a system that ignores, belittles and disrespects the voices of social housing tenants. The Grenfell inquiry described how residents were treated by their housing provider as “a nuisance, or worse”. That culture is still alive in our housing system, and I see the consequences of it every day in the emails and letters I receive from residents.A recent housing survey I conducted of residents in Kensington and Bayswater reveals just how deep the crisis runs. Just over half (51%) of the 146 residents who responded said damp and mould were a major issue in their homes; 89% had reported a problem to their landlord in the past year, but 78% of those said it was not fixed at the first time of asking. And behind these statistics are stories of daily struggle.Take Sancha, who lives next to Grenfell with her five children. Her son uses a wheelchair and is waiting for open-heart surgery. They live on the top floor of a building where the lift constantly breaks. Their flat has no heating and no reliable hot water. She has been waiting more than three years to be moved to a suitable property in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea – and has heard nothing.Lacey, a mother of a six-year-old with autism, told me her daughter has tried to jump out of the window twice. Despite safeguarding warnings, the family remains in overcrowded, unsafe housing. “I’ve reached burnout,” she said.One parent told me their son is missing school due to chronic respiratory problems caused by damp and mould in their home – the very same hazard that led to the tragic death ofAwaab Ishakin Rochdale in 2020 after he was exposed to extensive mould in the one-bedroom flat he shared with his parents.Poor housing is one of the hidden drivers of inequality in the UK – limiting children’s opportunity, damaging people’s health and compounding the cost of living crisis. But here in Kensington and Bayswater, we sit at the sharpest edge of it. This is one of the most unaffordable places to live in the country, with some of the worst housing inequality anywhere in Britain – where, on average, just39 social or affordable homesare built each year. That’s the third-worst record in London, according to Trust for London. And it’s unacceptable.The positive news is that this government has committed to tackling our housing crisis from multiple angles. This includes the biggest increase in social and genuinely affordable housing in a generation as part of the 1.5m housebuilding target for England. To achieve that, the government recentlyannounced £2bnto deliver up to 18,000 new social and affordable homes, with significantly more expected in June’s spending review.Alongside new homes are new laws and regulations governing housing quality, withAwaab’s law coming into forcein October, thelong-overdue renters’ rights bill (which theTories are still trying to thwart), and requirements for more training and professional standards for housing officers.But from experience in my constituency, those policies will only deliver for residents if they are matched by a change in how social landlords operate. For example, I don’t believe any of our housing associations are currently capable of implementing Awaab’s law, including a 24-hour repair window for emergency levels of damp and mould. Too many are still failing to take basic responsibility, communicate clearly or treat health hazards with the urgency they demand.That’s why last week I launched asafe and healthy homescampaign, asking housing associations and local councils to sign up to three specific commitments: to deliver faster and higher-quality repairs services; to inspect and resolve damp and mould issues in line with Awaab’s law; and to improve communications, so residents receive accurate, timely and respectful updates about their homes. Some of the commitments will be legally enforceable by the autumn – and the key housing providers met residents at a public meeting on Thursday, where they agreed to the three commitments and added more of their own. They can be sure that I will hold them to account.Hundred-year wait for family-size social housing in parts of England, study findsRead moreMy hope is that this part of west London – with the legacy of Grenfell and its roots asthe birthplaceof many of the UK’s social housing landlords – can become a test bed for change. Because if we can get it right here, we can set the standard for the rest of the UK.But more than that, this is about restoring trust – not just in housing providers, but in the institutions meant to serve and protect us. When families feel unheard, ignored and forced to live in unsafe conditions, it erodes faith in the entire democratic system. If local and national governments can’t deliver something as basic as a safe home, people will lose faith in democracy itself. Fixing this crisis is central to this government’s mission: to restore trust and prove that public services can deliver – for everyone, no matter where they live.Joe Powell is theLabourMP for Kensington and BayswaterExplore more on these topicsSocial housingOpinionHousingLabourCommunitiesLondoncommentShareReuse this content"

And no wonder.Home ownershipis slipping out of reach for many Australians, especially the young and the poor, as house prices have risen much faster than incomes.So it was no surprise that both major parties officially launched their campaigns with new pitches to support first home buyers.But will they make a difference? And if not, what will?In an announcement that no serious economist had been calling for, the Coalition pledgedto make mortgage payments tax deductiblefor first home buyers who purchase a newly built home.The housing policies of both major parties are bad for Australia’s aspiring homebuyers | Saul EslakeRead moreThe plan would allow buyers to deduct the interest costs on the first $650,000 of their mortgage from their taxable income for the first five years after purchase, and only for individuals earning less than $175,000, and couples earning less than $250,000.Likethe Coalition’s existing planto allow first home buyers to withdraw up to $50,000 from their super to buy a home, making mortgage payments tax deductible would put more money in the pockets of first home buyers.But the costs incurred in owning an asset should only be tax deductible if any capital gains are also taxed – as they are in countries that allow deductibility of mortgage repayments, such as the US – and no one is proposing taxing the family home. Which makes this policy just another first home buyers’ grant by another name.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterBut unlike first home buyers’ grants, which do raise buyers’ purchasing power, it’s unclear whether making mortgage interest payments tax deductible will result in banks being willing to lend more to eligible first home buyers.It’s also highly regressive, subsidising 47% of high-earners’ mortgage interest costs – offering a benefit of $87,000 over five years at prevailing interest rates for a primary income earner on $240,000 who deducts the interest on a $650,000 mortgage.Those on low incomes – the group most likely to be priced out of home ownership – would receive much less. For someone earning $60,000, they would receive just $23,000 in tax savings on a $250,000 mortgage.The good news is that the deduction will only be available to roughly the quarter of first home buyers who buy a newly built home, who make up less than 1 in 10 of all home buyers each year.The planmayhelp build some extra homes, since the value of the tax concession will be priced into the cost of new homes, which could make some marginal developments feasible at a timewhen construction costs have spiked.Scheme for smaller deposits a solution?On the same day, Laborpledged to extend the First Home Guarantee scheme, which guarantees 15% of the property’s value for first home buyers, allowing people to buy a home with just a 5% deposit and avoid Lenders Mortgage Insurance, which costs $23,000 for the average first home buyer.There will be no caps on the number of places (currently 50,000 each year), nor on the incomes of first home buyers (currently $125,000 for singles, and $200,000 for couples), starting from 1 July 2026.And property price limits will also be raised to average house prices in each city and region – rising from $900,000 to $1.5m in Sydney, for example.LiveHow did Australia's housing market get so bad, and is it all negative gearing's fault? – videoThe Coalition has also promised to expandthe scheme – by raising the income threshold for the scheme from $125,000 to $175,000 for singles, and from $200,000 to $250,000 for couples, with the same property price caps as Labor.The government expects that nearly 80,000 first home buyers would use the expanded scheme each year.But again, the policy is unlikely to raise the rate of home ownership, since those struggling to afford a home are already eligible for the scheme. Abolishing the income caps will bring higher-income earners into the scheme – and they are already likely to buy a home anyway without the government’s support.High hopes for more housingMore promising is Labor’s announcement today that it would invest $10bn ($2bn in grants, $8bn in concessional loans) to partner with state developers and industry, to build up to 100,000 homes – with these homes reserved for sale only to first home buyers.Australia hasnot built enough housingto meet the needs of our growing population, largely because state land-use planning regimes have made it too hard to build more homes in the established suburbs of our major cities.Sharp rises in interest ratesslowed housing approvals, especially for higher-density developments, as developers struggled for sufficient pre-sales to secure finance and commence construction. State-run developers can help get housing construction moving since they don’t need to wait for pre-sales to start building.Leaders brush off warnings from economists that duelling housing policies will drive up prices in AustraliaRead moreIf all built, these 100,000 homes would be enough to reduce house prices and rents by up to 2.5%, more than offsetting the impact on house prices of expanding the First Home Guarantee Scheme.But Labor will have to work hard to avoid funding homes that state governments intend to build anyway, or saddling successful developments with requirements, like a mandated share of affordable homes offered to first home buyers at below cost, that make developments uneconomic to build.It followsthe Coalition’s recently announced planto offer councils $5bn (via an unspecified mix of grants and concessional loans) to connect new homes to roads, sewerage, water, and other infrastructure around housing projects.And the government has already committed $3.5bn in incentive payments to the states if they can deliver on theNational Cabinet Housing Plan to build 1.2m homes over five years.At least, unlike past elections, both major parties are competing over who can get the most homes built. That matters, because housing will only get more affordable in Australia if we build more of it.Brendan Coates is the housing and economic security program director at Grattan InstituteExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionAustralian election 2025Labor partyCoalitionAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

They will take out bigger mortgages. And so house prices will go up. As they always do.At least the tax-deductibility of mortgage interest will be limited to those first home buyers who buy new homes. The Coalition argues that its policy will encourage more first time buyers to purchase new homes – if they can find them, because there’s nothing in this policy which will encourage more homes to be built.But, as a matter of simple logic, if the demand for new homes increases and the supply of new homes doesn’t, then the price of new homes will go up. And history tells us that this will be reflected, to at least some extent, in the prices of existing homes.When you combine this with the Coalition’s “super for housing” scheme – which in effect isa “souped-up” first homeowner grant schemeusing first homeowners’ money (their superannuation savings) rather than taxpayers’ – the effect of the Coalition’s housing policies will be to reignite housing price inflation, the principal cause of the housing crisis we have today (indeed, it has been building for more than two decades).But the Coalition isn’t alone in advocating policies which would add to upward pressure on housing prices.At its campaign launch, Labor promised to extend its deposit guarantee scheme, allowing all first home buyers (rather than, as now, those with incomes of less than $125,000 or $200,000 for couples) to buy a first home with a deposit of 5%, by guaranteeing the remaining 15% of a mortgage normally covered by a deposit to avoid having to take out lenders’ mortgage insurance. And the cap of 50,000 on the number of participants eligible to take up the scheme in any one financial year will be abolished.In theory, this scheme allows someone who’s saved up a deposit of, say, $50,000 – and can thus take out a mortgage of $200,000 (without lenders’ mortgage insurance) and so can buy a $250,000 house (if she or he can find one) – to be able to take out a mortgage of up to $800,000 (and thus buy a much more expensive house).In practice, of course, someone who’s only been able to accumulate a deposit of $50,000 probably wouldn’t be able to service an $800,000 mortgage – the loan serviceability assessment criteria applied by lenders won’t change. But he or she might be able to service a mortgage of, say, $400,000. And so with borrowing capacity thus enhanced, prices will go up.Here’s why Australia should build more smaller houses rather than fewer big ones | Peter MaresRead moreLabor says its proposal will allow about 3,000 people unable to buy homes at all to do so, and a further 27,000 people who can afford to buy homes to take out a larger mortgage to buy a more expensive one. It’s arguing that this won’t have asubstantialimpact on house prices – although it is at least honest enough to acknowledge that it will havesomeimpact.And it is also proposing a policy which will do something to boost thesupplyof housing – by “investing” $10bn by way of grants to the states and territories ($2bn) and interest-free loans or equity investments ($8bn) to speed up the construction of homes, especially on vacant or under-used government land, for sale to first home buyers. Labor says that this will result in the construction of an additional 100,000 homes over eight years.One is left to wonder, why do parties of both major political persuasions keep doing things which they know will put upward pressure on house prices, and thus exacerbate the problem they say they are trying to solve?It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the reason is that they know there are only about 110,000 people who each year succeed in becoming first home buyers. And even if you assume that for every one who does, there are five or six who don’t, that’s still only 700,000 or so votes, tops, for policies that might restrain the rate of house price inflation or halt it altogether. Politicians also know that at any point in time there are more than 11 million voters who own their own homes, and more than 2.25 million who own at least one investment property. The last thing those 11 million to 13 million voters want is anything that might restrain – let alone halt – the rate of property price inflation.So, on the one hand, 700,000 votes, on the other, something north of 11 million – even the dumbest of our politicians can “do that math”. And they do.Saul Eslake is a vice-chancellor’s fellow at the University of Tasmania and an independent consulting economistExplore more on these topicsHousingOpinionAustralian election 2025InflationAustralian politicsAustralian economyCoalitionLabor partycommentShareReuse this content"

Theatre’s epic endurance performers reveal how they keep the magic alive night after nightArifa AkbarMon 14 Apr 2025 11.40 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 12.32 EDTShare‘Ithought I’d do a year and leave,” says Sara Poyzer, who played mother Donna in the Abba musicalMamma Mia!“But the things I gained outweighed the things I lost.” She ended up staying in the part for an entire decade, even performing in front of two Abba members and at the show’s 20th anniversary, before leaving in January 2024.Among all the glitzy new openings in London’s West End, there are a sturdy cohort of shows that seem to have just always been there. Audiences still seem to be delighted byThe Lion King, now in its 26th year, and other long-running hits – but what’s it like for the actors like Poyzer, who play the same part seven or eight times a week, year after year? Does it become a groundhog day on the boards? And how do they keep their performances – and the shows – fresh?I have to train. I have to go to the gym. I have to eat right. You won’t last otherwiseStrangely, all the repetition and routine actually gave Poyzer a sense of creative freedom. “You say the lines in a certain order, stand in a certain spot, and all those things. But once they’re in place, I feel free.” She infused the role with aspects of her own character to keep Donna energised. “I have always taken my experience into my performance. So if I was feeling particularly emotional, a song might be a more emotional piece of storytelling that night. If I was pissed off, I’d be more fiery. I felt there was enough licence to be able to tell the story afresh.”It is important to understand that no two performances in a show’s run are ever the same, says Sean Jones, who has starred in Willy Russell’s musical Blood Brothers, in theWest Endand on tour since 1999. “There is always one new cast member and that’s the audience,” he says. “If you’re paying attention to them, you know you’ve got a different show on your hands every night. For example, we’ve just had a school audience in, which requires a different tack. If I start sobbing and snotting my way through the emotional scenes, it can make a teenager uncomfortable.”View image in fullscreen‘I find the energy because I love it’ … Sean Jones, left, with Joe Sleight in Blood Brothers.Photograph: Jack MerrimanAs you become more intimate with your character, they take on new depths, thinks Shaun Escoffery, who has played The Lion King’s benevolent king of the jungle for a whopping 17 years. “Mufasa is such a complex, multilayered character,” he says. “He’s a king, a warrior, a husband, a father, a brother to his arch-enemy. He’s deeply spiritual and open-hearted, but also a ferocious lion.”To have to encompass all of those qualities felt overwhelming at first, he says, but the part has evolved with him. “I’ve grown up playing the role. During that time, I got married, I had children, and that’s changed me as a man. So I’ve tried to implement being a father, being a husband and having a depth of spirituality into the character. It’s been a real epiphany for me.”Complacency is the enemy for Escoffery, not least because it risks letting down the audience and cast: “To become static or think, ‘I’ve got this’, is a very dangerous place to be.” He has an internal trigger to get himself ready for his role afresh. “I call it my on and off switch. It doesn’t matter how I’m feeling – I have to switch it on. That keeps me on my toes.”Jack Baldwin has been in the immersive show Faulty Towers: The Dining Experience for 13 years, playing beleaguered hotelier Basil. Baldwin never tries to replicate John Cleese’s performance in the original sitcom – nor his own from the night before: “That would be a museum piece.”The show requires lots of improvisation, which helps make each night different. “There’s a script, which is the spine of the show, but a lot of it is about turning to people and eliciting a response. You rehearse the fight choreography and the scripted bits but there are chunks where we are instructed to interact with the audience.”There is always an injection of fresh energy when a new cast member arrives. “I’ve had a lot of different co-stars,” says Jones, who in Blood Brothers plays Mickey, separated at birth from his twin, Eddie. “Every new Linda [Mickey’s friend] or Mrs Johnstone [his mother] is going to bring something different out in me. I feel like I am rediscovering the show again.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve grown up playing the role’ … Shaun Escoffery in costume as Mufasa, the Lion King, backstage at the Lyceum theatre.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianPoyzer says she “can be slightly mischievous” on stage. “It’s amazing the amount of fire it can add.” She has just appeared in Come From Away and says: “Most of the cast were really playful. There was a moment when I’m meant to flirt with a character. I grabbed his lapels and pulled him towards me – which I’d never done before. I could sense him coming alive. I saw it in his eyes.”Striving for the best, most perfect version of her own performance is a constant challenge: “I have sometimes come off stage and thought, ‘That was brilliant. I want to do that tomorrow.’ I have chased that, thinking, ‘What did I do?’ and ‘How did I achieve that?’ Or, ‘Why did I not do it tonight?’ It’s almost mathematical.”Escoffery finds himself shifting his intentions, from performance to performance. “For example, I reflect on what Mufasa was thinking before his son Simba came, before he met the lioness Sarabi, before he became the king of the Pride Lands. What was his history?” George Asprey, who plays baddie Scar, joined The Lion King at the same time: “We know each other very deeply and keep each other accountable,” says Escoffery. “So if we feel a little bit of a lull, or there’s a lapse in our performance, we pull each other up.”View image in fullscreen‘I can’t do the goose-step for 13 more years’ … Jack Baldwin as Basil Fawlty.Photograph: Patch StudioLong-running shows can become family affairs. Jones met his (now former) wife, actor Tracy Spencer, on Blood Brothers and they toured as a family. His 15-year-old daughter, an aspiring actor, now wants a part. Poyzer was in Mamma Mia! with her actor-husband Richard Standing, who is still in the show. They have performed it around the world together.A long-running show, says Poyzer, can put enormous pressure on a voice. “You’re going to get fatigue, so you have to really take care of it, particularly when you’re singing repetitiously. It’s about readjusting your vocal cords and all the parts of your anatomy you use when you’re singing to constantly make sure it’s optimum.”Escoffery keeps to a highly disciplined exercise routine. “The show is very physical. I have to train, I have to go to the gym, I have to eat right. You won’t last otherwise.” In Blood Brothers, Jones plays Mickey as a child. Now that the actor is 52, he gets “more aches and bruises” but adds: “I find the energy because I love doing it. But there used to be a scene where Mickey would run on and leap over a sofa. About five years ago I was getting pain in my legs from that, so now I just run across the stage, which has the same kind of impact.”While the shows have largely stayed the same, the actors have noticed changes in their audiences. Faulty Towers was one of the first immersive shows and the form was little understood, even by Baldwin at first. People are more comfortable with the interaction now, he says. With Mamma Mia! there was a growing sense of ownership over the show following the success of the film, starring Meryl Streep as Donna. “A sense that this is ours, we know it, we’ve got the DVD.”Do they think they’ll all be in their roles for decades yet? Baldwin, for one, does not anticipate putting in another 13 years. “I don’t think I could do it physically,” he says. “I’d feel like I was cheating people if I couldn’t do certain movements that people want to see. The goose-step is the big one!”Jones left Blood Brothers twice but was pulled back. “I still loved it as much,” he says. “I still wanted to discover it as much – and I also like the touring lifestyle. Once upon a time, I would probably just have joined the circus.”Although Poyzer left Mamma Mia! to tour in Come From Away, she would love to return to Donna. “I’d like to play her again with all the experience, personal and professional, that I would bring to the role. I went to a restaurant last week in Italy. They were chatting about Mamma Mia! and made me sing The Winner Takes It All. I thought, ‘Oh my gosh, I’ve never sung it likethatbefore.’”Explore more on these topicsWest EndMusicalsTheatreMamma Mia!The Lion KingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was convinced it was terrible – but we showed it at Cannes and they went crazy. Audiences had never seen a character like that treated sympathetically’Interviews by Simon BlandMon 14 Apr 2025 10.25 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 17.31 EDTSharePJ Hogan, writer and directorThe kernel of the story was my family, and my sister’s stormy relationship with our dad. He was a local politician and, like Trump, obsessed with success. I’m one of seven and my sister and I are the oldest. To use my dad’s language, we were the most useless because we wanted to be artists and so were unemployable. He was very dismissive of us.I managed to get to film school but my sister was stuck at home. My dad got her a job selling cosmetics but everyone knew the woman employing her was his mistress. Suddenly my sister disappeared, and it turned out she hadn’t been making money from the job at all, she’d just been robbing my dad and pretending she was doing well in the job.Toni Collette never judged Muriel – her performance took the character to a level that shocked meSix months later she contacted me. She’d been living in Sydney. She said, “I suppose you’re mad at me?” I said, “No. You had to get out.” I thought there was something very moving about her story and asked her permission to tell it. She said OK but made me promise one thing: that she’d be a heroine.I identify with Mike Leigh films. He’s a truth teller. I wanted to do an Australian version. Nobody wanted to make the film. They all said the same thing: “Nobody wants to see a girl who’s not only unlikable and inarticulate but plus-sized, a thief and a liar.” I tried a draft where Muriel doesn’t steal the money but it felt wrong. I decided to down torpedoes, return to the original and find someone crazy enough to make it.I went to film school with Jane Campion, and she got it made. We had sent the script to the company that financed her film The Piano – they were going to turn us down but I called Jane and said it’d really help if you send a message to the head of the company telling them I might be able to make a decent film. I owe her my career.Many actors didn’t want to play Muriel. But Toni Collette never judged her; she got her on a deep level. One of the earliest scenes we shot was when Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths) confronts Muriel in a wedding store while she’s trying on dresses. The emotional rawness of the scene still hits me. Toni was utterly vulnerable and emotionally naked. She took it to another level that shocked me. I could see Muriel’s desperation, loneliness and self-hatred.I was convinced it was a terrible movie but we showed it at the Cannes film festival and they went crazy. I made it for Australian audiences so it amazes me that it crosses oceans. There’s something universal about Muriel. I think it was validating for people from dysfunctional families or who had to do a Muriel thing to escape. Audiences had never seen anybody like her treated sympathetically.Rachel Griffiths, played RhondaRhonda was based on a Sicilian Australian friend of mine who’s relentlessly positive and absolutely believes in everyone. My job was to be the first person Muriel had ever met who saw something in her that no one around her did, and who believed in her so passionately that she could believe in herself. I think that’s why people love Rhonda. We all dream of having that friend.I was in awe of Toni. She was unashamed to portray those ugly, nasty, weird feelings that young women feel they shouldn’t have. To put them on screen is such an insanely vulnerable and almost political thing. The truthfulness of awkward, icky, girl feelings didn’t fit the female narrative. We all get that now but it was pretty radical when the film was released. It’s another reason why it hasn’t aged.Singing Abba with Toni, and having that exquisite chemistry with another person when you know something beautiful is being communicated, the audience is with you and you’re harmonising and feeding off each other? To this day, it’s in my top five days at the office.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That look we gave each other had been utterly earned by making the film together. It’s so open, loving, beautiful, hopeful, shared and stupid … I get a little teary whenever I watch it because it’s so real. That’s friendship.Muriel’s Wedding review – Toni Collette is outstanding in the film that brought Abba backRead moreDespite the fact Muriel is desperate to get married, the film passes the Bechdel test – it is really about female friendships and the family you make for yourself – especially if you’re from one that has some toxic, fucked up elements.I was in New York once and a gay man told me what the film meant to him and gave me a whole thesis about how Muriel’s Wedding was not only a metaphor for LGBTQ+ people growing up in small-minded places but also for the Aids crisis. When you or your best friend get sick and are dragged back to the judgmental place where you’re not seen or loved – like Rhonda is – that was every gay man in New York’s deepest fear. Being cut off from their new family. It really blew my mind.So many people would come up to Toni and say, “Oh my God, I’m Muriel!” Sharon Stone has told her it! There’s something so universal about that feeling of falling short of what society thinks you can and should be.Muriel’s Wedding the Musical is at Curve theatre, Leicester, until 10 May.

But unfunny and mean will always die a deathMon 14 Apr 2025 11.14 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 11.32 EDTShareIn these partisan times, when all is binary and everyone must pick a side, I have chosen mine. Aimee Lou Wood, she of The White Lotus and thus now instantly recognisable worldwide, is absolutely right to call out Saturday Night Live, the legendary US entertainment and satire show,for making jokes about her teeth. The special relationship is under enough strain without having to lean into old stereotypes about British gnashers. I am still reeling from theBig Book of British Smilesgag in The Simpsons and I continue to floss every day because of it.The SNL joke, if you are yet to see it, is part of a wider sketch making fun of the Trump administration. (Because if one thing has been proven to quell the march of the right, it’s parody.) A White Lotus character is mashed up with someone adjacent to Robert F Kennedy, he mentions fluoride, and a Wood-esque character says “What’s that?”It’s a funny joke, initially, because if one thing has transcendedThe White Lotus, it’s Wood’s smile. I haven’t seen The White Lotus myself. But I know three things about it. It’s set in Thailand, Arnie Schwarzenegger’s son is in it, and one of its main talking points has been the gaps between her teeth.However, it’s not a funny joke when you pull at its threads. Firstly, fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that is added to toothpaste and water because it helps keep teeth healthy. The premise of the joke, therefore, is that Wood’s teeth are unhealthy, which they absolutely are not. The joke is fundamentally dishonest and as a result, that initial laugh is followed by the shame of punching down at someone who is the star of a worldwide TV smash hit.Secondly, if British people do have “bad” teeth, it’s not because of a lack of fluoride, of which we are full to the brim. Heck, I think they even put it in our cider now. It’s because of a NHS that provides dentistry through contracts known asgeneral dental servicesthat are really complicated and thought of as not fit for purpose. It’s easier to find someone who will give you a free check-up of your gut health than it is to find someone to look into your mouth. But then it’s hard to tell a joke with that premise in three seconds.Wood saw the show, took to social media, and dubbed the skit “mean and unfunny”. There’s a lot there to unpack. Some jokes are funny, some are mean, some are funny and mean and, as Wood says, some are mean and unfunny. That’s the area best avoided.As someone who professionally mines funny, I think the lines in comedy aren’t that complicated. If you’re telling the truth, and your angle is clever enough, the joke is worth telling. If the joke only works if you turn a blind eye to the fact it is based on a fallacy, it is probably something that should remain on a Post-it note on a writers’ room wall. But, if these poor-taste gags sometimes escape, they serve to remind us that comedy writers aren’t perfect, cultural vacuums confuse actualities with bias, and the right to reply that famous people have means that this kind of transgression is not something you can get away with.At the end of the day, the skit told us more about the American obsession with having Tippex-white teeth as straight as Trump’s golf swing than it did Wood’s teeth. For that reason, she’s completely right to call them out. But here’s another thing for the SNL writers to consider: if we’re talking today about depictions of Wood’s teeth, and not the other points they were trying to make – about antivaxxers, illegal deportations, nonsensical tariffs and a collapsing economy – they appear to have missed the target. And in that case, the other victim is satire itself.Athena Kugblenu is a writer and comedianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

A painted version of his fist-pumping stance after being shot in July 2024 now greets visitors in the entrance hall of the White House. This “Fight, fight, fight!” canvas is true strongman art.It is just the latest in a series of artistic moves by Trump that look disturbingly tyrannical. When he complained that a portrait of himself in the Colorado State Capitol building was “purposefully distorted” it was taken down as quickly as if the US were Stalin’s Soviet Union. And he has ordered JD Vance to purge the Smithsonian museums of “improper ideology”. But how seriously should any of this be taken? Is it an urgent threat to democracy and culture or mere muscle-flexing?View image in fullscreenA poster for the Entartete Kunst exhibition in Munich, 1937.Photograph: © mahJ / Christophe FouinA show currently in Paris offers a troubling historical perspective on Trump’s art antics. “Degenerate” Art: The Trial of Modern Art Under Nazism, at theMusée Picasso, takes you back to the age of the dictators when totalitarian regimes sought to control art absolutely and use it to their own ends. I wasn’t keen to plunge into Nazi cultural history after the sunny pleasures ofDavid Hockney’s epic retrospective, but I was politely dragged along. The chill was instant.The show opens with fragments of sculpture displayed like archaeological relics – which is what they are. In 2010, archaeologists in Berlin excavating land cleared for a new underground line discovered not Roman coins or a medieval plague pit but remains of modernist artworks confiscated by the Nazis, branded “degenerate art” and dumped in a store that had been bombed in an air raid in 1944. The most compelling fragment, by the expressionist sculptor Emy Roeder, is the head of a primitive angelic being, severed at the shoulders. It’s a reminder of the fate of modernist art in German museums in the 1930s. Much of it was destroyed or lost, but not all.In 1937, more than 700 works of modern art went on display in Munich in the exhibition Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art) in order to be held up to ridicule and contempt. Afterwards, those with the most market appeal were sold abroad to benefit the Reich. At the Musée Picasso, some of these masterpieces have been reunited, borrowed from the collections where they ended up. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner’s 1913 paintingStreet, Berlinhas come from MoMA in New York.Its purple and black energy lifts you, as Kirchner depicts edgy, eroticised city life on the eve of the first world war, with two women parading past a crowd of sexually intimidated men. Kirchner’s painting was condemned for its attack on classical order and harmony, its jagged planes and purposeful distortions. Metropolis is another riotous vision, as the artist George Grosz equates artistic and political revolution.View image in fullscreenGeorge Grosz: Metropolis, 1916-1917.Photograph: Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza. Madrid/Estate of George Grosz, Princeton, NJ / Adagp, Paris, 2024These and other “degenerate” works were contrasted with the “healthy” Nazi art that was also unveiled in the same city in 1937 in a simultaneous exhibition called Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung (Great German Art). Hitler was in town to open it, and in the speech he gave, he defines degenerate art as the opposite of the Nazi athletic ideal that had been celebrated the previous summer by the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Rhetorically addressing the modernists, he tells them they just don’t get it with their primitivist art that looks like it comes from the stone age. They don’t see the beauty of Nazi man; degenerateArt, according to Hitler, portrayed “degenerate” people. It depicts, he claimed, “deformed cripples and cretins, women who can only have a repulsive effect, men who are closer to animals than humans, children who, if they had to live this way, would have to be seen as the veritable curse of God!”Is Hitler’s characterisation of modern art in any way recognisable? It took me a while to see why a Nazi may have been offended by Otto Dix’s unflattering, vivid portrait of the artistFranz Radziwill. He poses formally holding a T-square, yet looks around vacantly with his bulging upside down pear of a face. Is this an example of the imperfect detritus of humanity? If so, it’s just the tip the iceberg, for no artist so provocatively captured the freedom and experimentalism of the 1920s Weimar Republic. Dix’s paintings of sex workers and sailors, circuses and sado-masochist brothels, positively embrace degeneracy. As for “cripples”, Dix, Grosz and other German dadaists after the first world war insisted on showing Germany the maimed bodies of its wounded veterans, begging on street corners or playing cards with artificial hands.View image in fullscreenOtto Dix’s portrait of Franz Radziwill at the “Degenerate” Art exhibition.Photograph: Stéphane de Sakutin/AFP/copyright  Succession Picasso 2024/Getty ImagesIn other words, the Nazi attack on modern art was really an attack on the attitudes embodied in the Weimar years of liberal hope, and on radical Weimar art that burst with sexual freedom and social compassion. It was a culture war.Marc Chagall’sThe Pinch of Snuff (Rabbi)is one of the most haunting works in the Paris show. Inspired by a Yiddish tale of how a snuff addiction led to a rabbi’s demonic temptation, it was bought by Mannheim’s Kunsthalle in 1928. It came under attack as early as 1933, when local Nazis put it on a poster telling people this was what their taxes were paying for. I look into the rabbi’s eyes and see the lost world of Jewish eastern Europe that inspired Chagall, and which Nazi Germany would obliterate. In 1941, 16,000 Jews would be shot dead in Chagall’s home city Vitebsk, in just one episode among many.Such colossal violence and murder has to make us a bit careful with comparisons between today’s far right and nazism. Historians of the 20th century are still debating if today’s populism is a type of fascism, but it’s worth phrasing this another way: the Nazis were adept populists. Hitler was democratically elected in 1933 and the totalitarian regime he then built always claimed – and probably had – a populist mandate. Hitler boasted of a special connection with the “true” German people, his base, and for whom he spoke. As for the culture war on modern art, more than a million people saw Chagall’s rabbi and the other works in the Entartete Kunst show in just six weeks.L’art “dégénéré”,Musée Picasso, Paris, until 25 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designNazismDonald TrumpArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Her band was huge – and then it fractured. She started two tours – and had to abandon them. The singer talks about 30 years of heaven and hellMon 14 Apr 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 14 Apr 2025 04.59 EDTShareThe new album by Garbage, Let All That We Imagine Be the Light, has the kind of sound that makes you think you have always known it. You somehow know the words as they land; you have the tune in your head on a single listen. But try saying that to the Edinburgh-born singerShirley Manson, who – although she has lived mainly in the US for almost 30 years – is incredibly Scottish about flattery, which is to say she doesn’t like it. “I think possibly you just relate deeply to the lyrics of Chinese Fire Horse,” she says wryly, down the line from Los Angeles. That track is about life chewing you up and spitting you out because you are too old. No, I say firmly, one fiftysomething to another (she is 58), I don’t relate to that at all.Let All That We Imaginehas its roots in 2016, when Mansonfell off stage on the first day of the tour for Strange Little Birds, the last album but one. “I’m not blaming myself for my physical exuberance,” she says. “I was thinking about lyrics, I was thinking about my body, and I tumbled into the security barrier. I smashed my hip pretty badly, but it took five years for it to disintegrate.”That resulted in a hip replacement in 2023. “The physical recovery is surprisingly easy,” she says. “I mean, there’s a lot of indignity involved. I had to zoom around in a sweat suit with a walker. I’ll leave that image just there; I don’t need to embellish that.” Between the pain and the painkillers, though, she had terrible brain fog andGarbageended up writing the album remotely, the rest of the band – Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker – sending her musical ideas. “I felt really isolated. My band are not communicative at the best of times, and I was completely cut off from them. The only thing I would get would be these instrumentals with some zany titles.”Weirdly, it worked: they had an album to tour by last year, and were about to play their biggest UK gig in 15 years, at Ovo Arena Wembley, when Manson’s other hip “collapsed the day before” and she had to have that one replaced too. “It’s been very confronting. It makes you question everything, how you want to move forward in your life, particularly as I’m at this late stage in my career. It’s also been really fascinating, though, I’ve got to be honest with you – dark and depressing and soul-crushing, and also kind of wonderful.”“That’s such a Shirley Manson thing to say,” I say.“Oh, God, really?”View image in fullscreenManson onstage with Garbage last year in Wolverhampton, before the collapse of her hip.Photograph: Katja Ogrin/RedfernsOnly Happy When It Rains wasn’t technically the breakthrough Garbage single – that was Stupid Girl – but both were released in 1995 and became the soundtrack to the year: caustic, self-aware, catchy but not in a people-pleasing way. Manson herself had been, as she describes it, plucked from obscurity, on the dole in Scotland and trying to get paid to make music. “I was pretty miserable, and I got a phone call out of the blue: do you want to come and work with one of America’s most favoured sons? Before I knew it, I was off, flying to Madison, Wisconsin, working on a new record, with a brand new band, and these people I’d never met before, and it was a wild, wild experience.”That favoured son was Vig, who, then nearly 40, was famous as the producer of Nirvana’s Nevermind and was an all-purpose big beast of alternative rock, a credited producer on Sonic Youth and Smashing Pumpkins albums. “It’s so mad,” Manson says. “In pop music terms, we were ancient when we started. I was the youngest member of the band, and I was 28, and we’re now 30 years on. That’s fucking bananas.”That eponymous debut album could do no wrong – it sold 4m copies worldwide and went double-platinum in the US, the UK and Australia. Manson says now that: “Butch in particular was credited with all our work, even though, to his eternal defence, he went out of his way to explain that the band worked as a band.” Truthfully, though, Manson had such panache that a whole bunch of us (by “us” I mean listeners to 90s indie rock) didn’t even notice the guys and thought this was a Scottish band, a frontwoman and her friends, and couldn’t figure out why they weren’t in the UK more often. We didn’t have Google then.“It’s funny you should say that,” she says, in a warm, you-idiot tone of voice. “As the years have progressed, I realise I don’t belong to anyone. Nobody really wants me. I’m definitely a Scottish artist, but Scotland has not really seen us as a Scottish band, and England obviously hasn’t seen us as a UK band, and then we come to America, and they think we’re some kind of transatlantic supergroup. We’ve landed nowhere, really.”View image in fullscreenManson with her bandmates.Photograph: Joseph CulticeThe 90s were also brutal to women in the music industry. “I was so young and I was hungry and distracted. I didn’t notice a lot of the micro-misogyny and the micro-sexism at first,” Manson says. “I was blinded by the dazzle of my career. I wasn’t paying attention. Back then, I read my own press, like a fool, and I was reading these horrible descriptions of me, really degrading or sexual in nature, or just nasty shit. It wasn’t just the male writers, although primarily the 90s music journalists were male. It really stung, and I found that hard.”Critique was often lascivious and slavering, but any amount of objectification was supposedly fine because it was always ironic, and that, in itself, was bullshit. But it morphed into a kind of bitterness and resentment, which I never understood. People would tear into Manson – and everyone: Kenickie, Sleeper, evenSalad– and I never really got where the anger came from.“I think it goes back to the 90s offering a different kind of woman, for the first time, arguably ever in culture,” Manson says. “Liberated, mouthy, opinionated, political, also often beautiful and powerful. At first, I think they thought it was a marvellous distraction, a joyous kink. And then, all of a sudden, they” – I’m going out on a limb to say “they”, here, are the patriarchy – “were like: ‘Wait a minute, these women are getting a lot of attention and taking up a lot of column space, and we’re going to crush it.’ Subconsciously, not deliberately, I don’t think. But there was a sense of: ‘You can go back to the hole that you crawled out of. Let’s get back to real music, serious music, proper creativity, important statements and important sounds coming from the men.’”It was a lot – endless horrible personal remarks from one direction and relentless, adulatory image-making from the other. “The problem with a lot of success is it comes with a lot of visual accompaniment. Your self is reflected back at you on every magazine. Some versions are gorgeous and fantastical and you look nothing like yourself – maybe there’s a small semblance of you in the eyes. And then there are incredibly unflattering ones … I wasn’t the right personality to deal with that. I found it repulsive. I didn’t get an iota of pleasure out of it. I felt that, if I was good enough, I would look like that image. But I don’t, so they have to augment it with lights and makeup and hair and stylists and nail manicurists. It really did a number on my self-esteem.”In the aftermath, Manson was open about her struggles with depression and body dysmorphic disorder, but that openness was distorted in the media as fragility, which now bugs the hell out of her. “I hate the phrase ‘mental health’, as applied to me. I have a very healthy psyche. I’m pretty tough, mentally. I have definitely suffered from bouts of depression. I see that as a healthy part of existing in the world. I think it’s really necessary. I think all this nonsense about us permanently having to feel ecstatic is silly.”View image in fullscreenOn tour with the band in 1998.Photograph: Gie Knaeps/Getty ImagesShe moved to the US in 1996. “Perhaps some other bands might have done well living in different continents,” she says, “but I don’t think it was on the cards for us.” By 2001, they were still flying high – Version 2.0 in 1998 had sold well, Beautiful Garbage did fine – but “we have to touch on the devastation wreaked by September 11 in the States,” she says. “That changed modern radio entirely, and one could argue it’s never really fully recovered since. Programming became really conservative: radio would only really play a certain sound – a very reassuring, unthreatening, fun vibe – and these very fierce women from the 90s just disappeared. That was when we started to see the rise of real mega-capitalist pop. We’ve been inundated with those sounds now for 20-odd years.”Manson loves pop. She loves Taylor Swift: “People make fun of her lyrics because they talk about an experience that they’re uninterested in, a very young woman coming of age, but make no mistake, Taylor Swift is a genius.” She loves Chappell Roan: “There’s nothing better than singing along to Pink Pony Club when you’ve just come off reading the news. Get me out of here, take me away, Chappell.” Yet she still lands the point, matter-of-factly, that mainstream music has been homogenised, in a way that makes me sad. But only later – it’s hard to feel sad while you are talking to Manson.In the mid-00s, the band went on a hiatus, cutting short the tour for their fourth album, Bleed Like Me, talking about solo projects. Manson’s mother developed dementia, and died in 2008, at which point, she says: “I was very depressed. Watching my mother die was the worst thing I’ve ever seen in my life, and my career had stalled. I had to make a choice to pull myself out and up, into my life. I just started saying to myself: ‘You are an artist. You do this for a living. You’ve done it very successfully, and you can do it again. So let’s just go and start writing music and being musical, doing the work, filling it with love and interest and passion and having an idea of where it’s going.’ I never believed I was an artist until my mother died. I felt it was her last gift to me.”View image in fullscreenAt Brixton Academy in London in 1996.Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty ImagesGarbage rediscovered their enthusiasm for each other and found a new way of working when they reformed in 2010, the year that Manson also married Garbage’s sound engineer, Billy Bush. Her first marriage, to the Scottish artist Eddie Farrell, had ended in 2003. “When I was young, I broke my back trying to facilitate communication in this band, and it nearly killed me. In 2012, I thought: ‘If they want this as much as I want this, we will do this together. And if they don’t want to do it, then it’s over.’ I was just going to sit and hold my own seat without having to serve the group. And I don’t have any expectations of them any more. We love each other, and if one of us goes down, the whole team is on it – we swarm to each other’s side. But other than that, we exist as four pillars, with massive space between us.”But the 2012 album, Not Your Kind of People, was a critical but not a commercial success, the 2016 tour was an orthopaedic disaster, and the 2021 album, No Gods No Masters, explicitly political and denouncing “capitalist shortsightedness, racism, sexism and misogyny”, as she put it at the time, nearly made her “very, very ill. I managed to pull myself out of what felt like a very dark abyss. And I was driving my husband insane. He was saying: ‘You’ve got to stop this. You can’t save the world.’ And although I disagree with him – I do believe in singular action – I had to save myself.”On my radar: Shirley Manson’s cultural highlightsRead moreShe describes a pre-gig ritual Garbage have had since they reformed. “We started doing it at the beginning of each show. It’s a piss-take of what all these other bands do. We look as though we’re about to high-five each other, and then we miss each other’s hands. We’ve done it for years. But now, since my surgeries, every time I do this ritual, and the hands go sailing through the air, I have a tiny pinch of: ‘Are we being the very thing we’re taking the piss out of? Or am I wanting some real connection here?’”Just go for it, I advise. Make the authentic high-five.“I don’t know if I’ve got the moral courage. I don’t know if it’s possible for us. Everybody’s so fucked up, it’s amazing.”The funny thing is, there was a lot of to and fro before the interview about whether Manson would turn on her camera for our video call. She didn’t want to, and I let it drop because the aforementioned savage 90s media was bound to make a person wary. When it came to it, it was nothing to do with the 90s, she said. “I’m sorry, but I’m nude in my bedroom, and I really don’t think you would appreciate that.”I didn’t really need to know what she looked like – I just wanted to see her expressions. But you can pretty much always hear that she is smiling.Let All That We Imagine Be the Light is out on 30 May (BMG).Explore more on these topicsShirley MansonThe G2 interviewGarbagePop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Vargas Llosa, who has died aged 89, owed the possibility of high office almost entirely to his novels, which put him at the forefront of world writers for more than 50 years.His early works, such as The Green House (1966) or Conversation in the Cathedral (1969), firmly established him as one of the leading authors of what came to be known as the “magical realism” school of writers, although in his case this was often more a question of novelistic technique than of any magical view of his country’s history. He also developed a comic vein most evident in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977) that also set him apart from other writers of the so-called “boom” in Latin American fiction.Vargas Llosa said that the urge to write came from the unusual circumstances surrounding his childhood. Born in the southern Peruvian city of Arequipa, he was sent by his grandfather, with his mother, Dora Llosa, brothers and sisters, to live in neighbouring Bolivia when his father, Ernesto Vargas, abandoned the family. The young Mario grew up believing his father was dead.When he was 10 his mother presented him to a complete stranger, and told him this was his father. Ernesto rejoined the family, and they lived together in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Recalling this difficult relationship in his autobiography A Fish in the Water (1993), Vargas Llosa spoke of the “social inferiority” his father felt towards his mother, and calls it “the national disease … the one that infests every stratum and every family in the country and leaves them all with a bad aftertaste of hatred, poisoning the lives of Peruvians in the form of resentment and social complexes”.The rancorous complexities of Peruvian life were brought home still more forcefully to the adolescent Mario when at the age of 14 he was sent to a military academy. He hated the harsh discipline, but it enabled him to meet people from different backgrounds and regions. The experience formed the subject matter of his first novel, The Time of the Hero (1963), and informed several of his later works.View image in fullscreenVargas Llosa was well aware by now that it was literary rather than military glory that he was destined for. By the age of 16, he was working as a crime reporter on a daily newspaper, and at 19 he eloped with his much older aunt by marriage, Julia Urquidi, whom he married in 1955. Once again, he turned this to good literary effect in Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, about a radio soap opera hack who finds it increasingly difficult to separate reality from his fictional creations. This was the only one of Vargas Lllosa’s books to attract Hollywood’s attention. William Boyd, the writer of the screenplay for the 1990 film (released in the US asTune in Tomorrow), described the original as “almost Swiftian, with a quality of fantasy that sees the world as lurid and absurd”.After graduating from the National University of San Marcos, Lima, in 1958, Vargas Llosa was living in Europe, either in Barcelona, London or Paris. At that time, the French capital was thronged with young Latin American writers – includingGabriel García Márquez, Julio Cortázar andCarlos Fuentes– and it was the French publishing houses who first created the boom in Latin American literature. The young Peruvian novelist was warmly welcomed as a member of this literary club.Vargas Llosa’s novels of this period are closer to the realist tradition of the novel than to “magical realism”, providing as they do incisive descriptions of many levels of Peruvian society. The magic consisted in the novelist’s skill of combining different narratives and voices without explicit connections, offering a rich complexity and suggesting a huge literary appetite.These early novels contained a sweeping criticism of the state of Peruvian and, more widely, Latin American society. The younger generation of writers took the political dimension of their work extremely seriously, and it was understood that they shared a leftwing viewpoint. Mario soon came to be seen as the odd man out. As so often, it wasFidel Castro’s revolution in Cuba that was the flashpoint. When Libre, a pan-Latin American magazine was launched in Paris, it was not long before Vargas Llosa, García Márquez and others quarrelled over whether to support Castro.Vargas Llosa consistently adopted a liberal attitude, and never accepted that any difference should be made between developing countries and Europe, the US or other representative democracies. His combative defence of this position earned him enemies among the left in Peru and the rest of Latin America, where it has often been argued that writers ought to be on the side of the majority of poor and downtrodden, providing them with a voice they are denied.View image in fullscreenThrough the next decades, Vargas Llosa continued to publish novels that won him success and critical attention throughout the world. Some, like The Storyteller (1987) or Death in the Andes (1993), suggest he was attempting a Peruvian version of Balzac’s multi-volume collection La Comédie Humaine, trying to encompass the whole of Peruvian society in his works. But, as he made plain in the critical work The Perpetual Orgy (1975), his personal preference was for another French master, Gustave Flaubert, for his modern spirit, his sense of irony and his intense preoccupation with language and style.Vargas Llosa’s international reputation led the Peruvian government to involve him directly in political matters in his home country. In 1983 he was asked to help investigate the killing of eight journalists in the remote Andean village of Uchuraccay. This occurred at the height of the struggle between Shining Path guerrillas and the Peruvian armed forces, and Vargas Llosa once again infuriated the left in Peru and elsewhere when he agreed with the official version that the villagers had mistaken the journalists for guerrilla fighters and killed them, rather than insisting that the blame lay with the security forces.His move to rightwing liberalism also came from his voracious reading. It was French historians such as Fernand Braudel who convinced him that the development of markets and the possibility of trading in the Middle Ages was fundamental to human nature. He found further confirmation of his political philosophy in the careers ofRonald ReaganandMargaret Thatcher, whom he fervently admired.Once more, Vargas Llosa translated these beliefs into action in his native Peru. When in 1986 the leftwing populist government underAlan Garcíadeclared its intention to default on the country’s foreign debt and to nationalise the banks, Vargas Llosa began a protest campaign in the name of individual freedom. It was this campaign that fed his presidential aspirations. In 1989, he presented himself as candidate for a variety of rightwing and centrist parties, campaigning on a conservative free-market ticket. He brought in campaign managers from Britain and set about using his writing and speaking skills to win over the Peruvian electorate.View image in fullscreenVargas Llosa campaigning in Lima, Peru, in 1990.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex FeaturesUnfortunately, it was plain from attending his political rallies that, although he might imaginatively understand the situation of hugely different sectors of Peruvian society, he did not have much idea of how to speak to them directly. Despite this uneasiness, he won most votes in the first round of the presidential election and was confident of winning the second round against an unknown Peruvian-Japanese agronomist,Alberto Fujimori.In the weeks between the two rounds of voting, however, Fujimori gained increasing support from poor Peruvians who saw in the light-skinned, cosmopolitan Vargas Llosa exactly the same kind of ruler who had been making unkept promises to them for several hundred years. Eventually, it came as little surprise that it was Fujimori who won. Vargas Llosa quit politics, unable at first to believe that he had been rejected in this way.His bitterness surfaced in Death in the Andes (1993), in which he portrays Peru’s Andean society as so backward that it is capable of cannibalism. Around the same period, he withdrew to a more intimate fictional world, exploring the possibilities of eroticism in In Praise of the Stepmother (1988) and The Notebooks of Don Rigoberto (1997).View image in fullscreenAlthough no longer directly involved in politics, Vargas Llosa used his journalistic skills to lambast the Fujimori regime, especially following the “auto-coup” the president engineered in 1992. Vargas Llosa complained that by way of reprisal, the authorities demolished his Lima home. This led him to renounce his Peruvian citizenship, and in 1993 he took Spanish nationality.The Feast of the Goat (2000) is his outstanding contribution to a long tradition of Latin American novels examining the abuses of power by dictators in the region. It deals with the Dominican Republic’s dictatorRafael Trujillo, and the moral, sexual and political corruption implied by authoritarian rule. “I wanted a realist treatment of a human being who became a monster because of the power he accumulated and the lack of resistance and criticism … Converted into a god, you become a devil,” Vargas Llosa commented of what many saw as his finest book.He continued to explore subjects outside Latin America that were nevertheless linked to Peru.The Way to Paradise(2003) concerned not only Paul Gauguin in Tahiti, but also the artist’s grandmother, Flora Tristan, an early revolutionary feminist in Peru. His 2010 novelThe Dream of the Celtis a fictional account of the life and death ofRoger Casement, whose views on slavery and colonialism were radicalised by his experiences during the time he spent living in the Peruvian Amazon.In that same year, Vargas Llosa wasawarded the Nobel prizefor literature. His acceptance speech was a passionate defence of fiction and reading, insisting that “without fiction we would be less conscious of the importance of the freedom that makes life liveable, and the hell it becomes when it is constrained by a tyrant, ideology or religion”.He had previously (in 1994) been the recipient of the Cervantes prize, the highest honour for writers in the Spanish-speaking world. In 2011, his friendship with the Spanish king Juan Carlos resulted in his being given the title of Marquis of Vargas Llosa.He and Urquidi divorced in 1964, and the following year he married his cousin Patricia Llosa. In 2015 he separated from her, and publicly announced his relationship with the socialite Isabel Preysler, much to the delight of the gossip magazines.The Neighbourhood(2018) is a steamy tale of the Peruvian jetset featuring blackmail by such a magazine. Their relationship ended in 2023, Vargas Llosa saying he wanted to devote more time to literature.His novel Tiempos Recios (2019) was his last to be published in English, asHarsh Times(2022). It examines a historical event, in this case the CIA-backed coup against the Guatemalan government in 1954, through a fictional account.In addition to novels, Vargas Llosa wrote extensively for the theatre, and acted in several of his own plays. He once told me in an interview, when asked what he thought would make a suitable epigraph for him: “He lived life to the full, and loved literature above all else.”He is survived by a daughter, Morgana, and two sons, Álvaro and Gonzalo, from his second marriage.Mario Vargas Llosa, writer, born 28 March 1936; died 13 April 2025Explore more on these topicsMario Vargas LlosaFiction in translationFictionEssaysPolitics booksPeruobituariesShareReuse this content"

It was my obsession.” His original idea, back in the 90s, was to have a shooter fire rounds at him as he stood behind bulletproof glass. This was to take place in front of an audience. “The idea was there,” he says. “But it was insane.”We should not be too surprised. The controversial Italian conceptualist has made headlines in recent years by taping a banana to a wall (andselling it for a fortune), smashing a meteor into the pope (or his likeness), and plumbing a gold toilet into Oxfordshire’s Blenheim Palace (which was then nicked). All in the name of high art satire. Cattelan’s work is direct, confrontational, obvious and brutally in your face. And now, in a small show at Gagosian in Mayfair, he has revisited that 90s notion – and blasted huge holes into sheets of gold with a pump-action shotgun.The new works are definitely more health and safety compliant, but still fairly shocking. Each gold panel (actually steel coated in 24-carat) has been shot using a 12-gauge shotgun, leaving cavernous, rusted gashes in the pristine mirrored surface. They are brilliant pieces of conceptual minimalism: grotesquely, abhorrently violent, ludicrously, grossly opulent.I’d never been to a shooting range. I’d never seen weapons before. I was excitedHe first started firing bullets at artworks after his exhibition at Blenheim Palace in 2019, shooting at gold and black versions of the union jack and the stars and stripes. “That was a time when nationalism was rampant, but not as bad as today. I liked the idea of using this symbol, but it was a little literal.” So he stripped away the overt symbolism, leaving behind just the gold and the gunshot wounds.“I’d never been to a shooting range. I’d never seen weapons before. The whole experience, witnessing shooting that doesn’t involve any type of violence – I was excited.” But after the initial excitement came the realisation of what guns are for and what they do. Was he shocked when he first saw the holes a gun could make in metal? “Yeah, I mean, it is energy transforming matter. But I would have been more shocked to see it used on something living.”View image in fullscreenNicked … America in Blenheim Palace in 2019 before it was stolen.Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty ImagesWhile these works are relatively small, in New York last year he covered an enormous wall in gold panels, all blasted with AR-15s, the weapon of choice in countless American mass shootings. “If you do only one panel, you have an artwork. If you do something massive, you have an execution wall – something more menacing.”In New York, the gallery bumf described the works as a comment on the scourge of American gun violence, a reflection of a society losing itself to barbarity while gorging itself on luxury. But in London, the gallery talks instead about how each work has been “modified” by gunshots as “metaphors for creation and transformation”. Gun violence has been swapped out for references to the history of Italian minimalism and nods to artists such as Lucio Fontana.This is typical Cattelan, whose work toys with double meanings and punny juxtapositions, flirting with the boundaries between good and bad, to expose bigger truths. Here, with these blasted panels, the bigger truth is societal: we’re surrounded by violence and death, while the rich are getting richer. The works come across as attacks on gun culture and an uncaring society, and yet they’re trophy artworks, ridiculously expensive objects for the mansions of the mega-rich. Are these collectors buying them as comments on violence, or as garish gold home decor? “We can talk about gun violence,” he says. “But it’s not the main subject. I like works that are open to interpretation.”Take Comedian, the banana he taped to a wall at a swanky art fair in 2019 and sold for $120,000, causing viral uproar in the process. It was at once a comment on the preposterousness of the art marketandan object of ludicrous art market-iness. “We didn’t know what was going to happen. We just tried to see how far we could go. I could not be in an art fair as a painter, or as a commodity. I thought it was a moment to make a statement.”Comedian exposed the staggering greed and capitalist opportunism of the art world, which uses aesthetics as an excuse for speculation and the accumulation of wealth. But the art world lapped it up. It was like watching turkeys clapping for Christmas. When it was subsequently bought at auction for$5.2m in November 2024 by crypto investor Justin Sun, who ate it live on stage, all of its unsubtle ludicrousness was laid bare. “This guy was looking for attention,” says Cattelan. “I think he did a good job.”View image in fullscreenViral uproar … Comedian on show in Miami in 2019.Photograph: Rhona Wise/EPABut leaving things so open to interpretation has its risks. I tell Cattelan about seeing his 2007 installation Ave Maria just before the pandemic. The work is a disembodied armsieg heil-ing out of a wall, locked in a perpetual fascist salute. Its messaging might seem obvious, its anti-fascist intentions clear to any viewer. But when I saw it, a group of students were taking selfies as they gleefullysieg heil-ed back at the artwork. He grimaces. “If I could have a list of works to erase, that work would be on it. We don’t own the meaning of what we do.”But erase it he did, in a way. “One of the hands of Ave Maria was on my desk for a long time, and one day I chopped off the fingers. This fascist salute was severed, and what was left was one finger.” So Ave Maria became Love, a huge carrara marble middle finger installed permanently in the heart of Milan’s financial district in 2010.And now the golden toilet. At Blenheim in 2019, he installed a fully functioning, fully gold toilet, and called it America. There aren’t a lot of ways to take that. Although created in 2016 for the Guggenheim in New York, the exhibition at Blenheim happened right in the middle of Donald Trump’s first term. There was nothing implicit in the work’s messaging: this was art about excess, wealth, greed, authoritarianism, and a nation going down the pan. A few days after being installed, the golden bog was stolen. Two men have now been convicted in connection with its burglary.But since America was nicked, things have only worsened: authoritarianism is rampant, Trump is back, the far right is flourishing. Can the work of a conceptual prankster like Cattelan do anything in the face of such a torrent of violence, inequality and discrimination? “I don’t think art has the power to oppose regimes,” he says quietly, thoughtfully. “But people have the power. People can oppose.”Maurizio Cattelan’s Bones is at Gagosian Davies Street, London, until 24 May.Explore more on these topicsArt and designMaurizio CattelanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This is because it was exactly the thing you assumed it to be.On one hand, The Baldwins desperately wanted to be a show in the traditional TLC mould; a zany happy-go-lucky series about the chaos of raising an enormous family. But on the other, it was also about what happened on the set of Rust in 2021. And so every wack-a-doodle moment of family fun found itself being counterbalanced with the explicit acknowledgment thatAlec Baldwinfatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in an accident that caused untold pain to countless people and has cast a long dark shadow over Baldwin’s career.View image in fullscreenGrapes yes, cheese no … Baldwin and Cate Blanchett in Blue Jasmine.Photograph: REX/Everett CollectionFor example, Sunday night’s episode of The Baldwins (entitled You’re My 30 Rock) served as the season finale, and revolved in part around the state of Alec’s health. At one point Hilaria clambered on to her husband while he was stretching and half-jokingly told him: “You hold trauma in your shoulders,” and, well, that probably sounds about right, given everything.Baldwin went on to say that his health has suffered since the shooting, and as such his energy has been depleted. The emotional toll of the Rust fallout, combined with the fact that his wife is a health nut 26 years his junior, has made him more determined than ever to get into shape. Specifically, the shape he was when he made Blue Jasmine.Blue Jasmine came out 12 years ago, and Baldwin – mainly seen in flashbacks, as Cate Blanchett’s husband who was arrested for fraud and then killed himself in prison – did look remarkably slender in it. His secret? “I didn’t have no pasta, no potatoes, no candy, no sugar, and I lost probably 25lbs [10kg],” he said. “You see me in the movie and I look trim, comparatively speaking.”Which isn’t to say that Baldwin got in shape specifically for Blue Jasmine, because that would be crazy. Traditionally body transformation like this is reserved for the big roles. Tom Hanks slimmed down for Castaway because he was in every scene of an incredibly ambitious movie for which he found himself nominated for an Oscar. De Niro bulked up for Raging Bull because the audiences needed to see how far his character had fallen. Meanwhile, Alec Baldwin had a bit part in a Woody Allen film, which probably isn’t worth completely denying yourself all sugar and carbohydrates for an extended period of time.Rust: first trailer for Alec Baldwin western appears after on-set shootingRead moreIndeed, interviews from the time suggest that Baldwin slimmed down less because it was integral to his character and more because he was diagnosed aspre-diabetic, and his high-sugar diet left him “exhausted” and “swollen”. Nevertheless, he did seem incredibly proud of losing weight; during a2012 Letterman appearancehe literally dropped his trousers onstage to show how badly they fit him.Still, the transformation wasn’t an especially dramatic one, given the extremes he went to. He still looked exactly like Alec Baldwin, just an Alec Baldwin who was moderately thinner than the Alec Baldwin from 2010.Things have (very understandably) slipped a little in the last few years, but the main thing is that Alec Baldwin has a goal again. Nobody knows if he’ll ever return to acting and, while The Baldwins might have been made out of financial necessity, it would be a surprise if anyone – including him – is eager for more. If getting back into shape is the thing that will finally bring him some peace, then that’s what he should concentrate on. Only this time it’d be nice if he could drop his trousers behind closed doors, please.Explore more on these topicsAlec BaldwinReality TVcommentShareReuse this content"

The film, which will premiere at Cannes next month, is set in May 2020 and concerns a standoff between the sheriff of a small town in New Mexico and the town’s mayor, who is seeking re-election.Joaquin Phoenix plays the sheriff, with Emma Stone his wife, while Pedro Pascal is the mayor. Austin Butler plays a charismatic preacher whose stirring speeches we see over YouTube and Instagram; we also see footage of the quarantined central characters on social media.Aster’s debut film, horror Hereditary, was a breakthrough hit at Sundance in 2018 and one of the top grossing films of that year. His follow-up, Midsommar, also met with praise and healthy box office, but 2023’s Beau is Afraid, also starring Phoenix, was less warmly received.Explore more on these topicsFilmJoaquin PhoenixEmma StonePedro PascalAustin Butlernews"

For others, a new TV adaptation is an opportunity for greater detail and faithfulness to JK Rowling’s magical seven-book series.Much of the guessing and speculation can be put to rest now, asHBOhas made its first official casting announcement for some of the wizarding world’s most notable characters in its forthcoming Harry Potter series.The company announced on Monday that John Lithgow would play Albus Dumbledore,Paapa Essieduwould be Severus Snape, Janet McTeer would be Minerva McGonagall, and Nick Frost would appear as Rubeus Hagrid. All four actors will be series regulars.Meanwhile, Luke Thallon was announced to play Quirinus Quirrell andPaul Whitehouseto play Argus Filch, both in guest and recurring roles.The series, designed to run for more than a decade, comes from the writer and showrunner Francesca Gardiner and director and executive producer Mark Mylod of Succession.“We are happy to announce the casting of John Lithgow,Janet McTeer, Paapa Essiedu, Nick Frost, Luke Thallon and Paul Whitehouse to play Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Hagrid, Quirrell and Filch,” the pair said. “We’re delighted to have such extraordinary talent onboard, and we can’t wait to see them bring these beloved characters to new life.”View image in fullscreenJK Rowling is an executive producer of the TV series.Photograph: Neil Hall/EPAThe US actor Lithgow, who most recently starred in the Bafta- and Oscar-winning papal election thriller Conclave, will take over the role played by Richard Harris and Michael Gambon in the films. Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, is a caring and powerful wizard who mentors Harry in his fight against the dark lord Voldemort.It hadpreviously been reportedthat Mark Rylance was in the running for the part. But Lithgow – a veteran of stage and screen, and winner of six Emmy awards (including for his role as Winston Churchill in The Crown), two Golden Globes, an Olivier and a Tony –announced his own castingin February.Essiedu received an Emmy nomination for his role in the critically acclaimed series I May Destroy You and also starred in series such as The Lazarus Project and Gangs of London. He will transform into the Hogwarts potions professor Snape, who was played by Alan Rickman in the films. Harry Potter is constantly at odds with Snape, who is hostile to him but is later revealed to have been bullied by Harry’s father, James, while harbouring an unrequited love for his mother, Lily.McTeer, a past winner of numerous accolades including a Tony, an Olivier and a Golden Globe, will be McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor house – a role played by Maggie Smith in the films. McTeer has appeared in films including Tumbleweeds, Wuthering Heights and The Menu.View image in fullscreenCillian Murphy has been rumoured to be in the frame to play Voldemort.Photograph: Kyle Grillot/EPAMeanwhile Frost, best known for his roles in the comedy films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, will take over from Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, the Hogwarts groundskeeper and half-giant who becomes a faithful friend and ally to Harry and his friends.The new casting announcement will undoubtedly draw much reaction from Potter fans.There had already been divisionafter rumours first emerged that Essiedu was being considered to play Snape, who is described in the books as having “greasy, shoulder-length black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin”. Others were concerned that a US star had been cast to play Dumbledore.The casting for the trio of main characters – Harry, Hermione and Ron – is yet to be announced, though it is likely they will be played by newcomers after Warner Broslaunched an open casting callfor children aged between nine and 11 last autumn. There have also been rumours that Cillian Murphy is beingconsidered to play Voldemort.According to HBO, the series will be a “faithful adaptation” of the books by Rowling, who serves as an executive producer. With a new cast, the show will delve into more detail than the eight feature films spawned by the epic franchise, released between 2001 and 2011.The series will be “full of the fantastic detail, much-loved characters and dramatic locations that Harry Potter fans have loved for over 25 years”, Max, the newly branded streaming service for HBO, promised in a statement upon theseries announcementin April 2023.“Each season will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, while the original, classic and beloved films will remain at the core of the franchise and available to watch globally.”Rowling has ownership over key aspects of the Harry Potter intellectual property, including the characters. But her involvement in the show has been divisive because of her opinions about trans people, which have drawn criticism from some of the franchise’s original stars. The writer’s expansive Harry Potter world – including the books, films, video games and theatre – isworth an estimated £20bn($26bn).At London’s Kings Cross station, site of the fictional platform 9 and ¾, fans were ambivalent about the cast.“As someone who grew up with the books, I’m looking forward to seeing what they’ve created,” said 25-year-old Grace Whitehill from London. “But at the same time, I don’t want my experience to be ruined if they create something that’s too far from whatJK Rowlingoriginally wrote.”Banker Jaston Fernandes, 25, agreed. “I think my only concern is I don’t want it to tarnish the legacy of what it’s been,” he said. “I’ve not seen the Cursed Child because I think it’s perfect as it is. I don’t want to touch it.”Fans were also quick to address the backlash faced by the casting of Essiedu as Snape. “[Essiedu] is not the problem – he’s a good actor in everything he does,” said Aurelia Jumeaucourt, a 30-year-old consultant from Paris. “The problem is people. As long as he’s a good actor, I don’t care what he looks like.”“Sometimes the fandom can be quite toxic,” said Whitehill, who has left many of the social media groups she was once part of. “It’s really lovely when you meet the right people, but sometimes it can get very cultish.”The series isexpected to debuton Max and the HBO and Warner Bros Discovery streaming service in 2026, almost 30 years after the first book in Rowling’s bestselling series was published in 1997, and 15 years after the final film landed on screens.Explore more on these topicsHarry PotterJK RowlingJohn LithgowPaapa EssieduNick FrostJanet McTeerPaul WhitehousenewsShareReuse this content"

It says it is working hard to fix this, but that industry-wide collaboration and government intervention are needed.Describing itself as “the ultimate virtual universe”, Roblox features millions of games and interactive environments, known collectively as “experiences”. Some of the content is developed by Roblox, but much of it is user-generated. In 2024, the platform had more than 85 million daily active users, an estimated 40% of whom are under 13.While the company said it “deeply sympathised” with parents whose children came to harm on the platform, it said “tens of millions of people have a positive, enriching and safe experience on Roblox every day”.However, inan investigation shared with the Guardian, the digital-behaviour experts Revealing Reality discovered “something deeply disturbing … a troubling disconnect between Roblox’s child-friendly appearance and the reality of what children experience on the platform”.View image in fullscreenA young Roblox user customises her avatar.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersRevealing Reality created multiple Roblox accounts, registering them to fictional users aged five, nine, 10, 13 and 40-plus. The accounts interacted only with one another, and not with users outside the experiment, to ensure their avatars’ behaviours were not influenced in any way.Despitenew tools launched last weekaimed at giving parents more control over their children’s accounts, the researchers concluded: “Safety controls that exist are limited in their effectiveness and there are still significant risks for children on the platform.”The report found that children as young as five were able to communicate with adults while playing games on the platform, and found examples of adults and children interacting with no effective age verification. This was despite Roblox changing its settings last November so that accounts listed as belonging to under-13s can no longer directly message others outside of games or experiences, instead having access only to public broadcast messages.The report also found the avatar belonging to the 10-year-old’s account could access “highly suggestive environments”. These included a hotel space where they could view a female avatar wearing fishnet stockings gyrating on a bed and other avatars lying on top of each other in sexually suggestive poses, and a public bathroom space where characters were urinating and avatars could choose fetish accessories to dress up in.1:00Club role-play hangout open to 10-year-old avatars – videoResearchers found that their test avatars overheard conversations between other players verbalising sexual activity, as well as repeated slurping, kissing and grunting noises, when using the voice chat function. Roblox says that all voice chat – which is available to phone-verified accounts registered as belonging to users aged 13 and above – is subject to real-time AI moderation.They also found that a test avatar registered to an adult was able to ask for the five-year-old test avatar’s Snapchat details using barely coded language. Though Roblox says in-game text chat is subject to built-in filters and moderation, the report says this is an example of how easily such measures can be circumvented, creating opportunities for predatory behaviour.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toPushing ButtonsFree weekly newsletterKeza MacDonald's weekly look at the world of gamingEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Johnson will co-star with his Jungle Cruise collaborator Emily Blunt, as well as Leonardo DiCaprio.The book will chronicle “the extraordinary story of the rise and fall of Hawaii’s most notorious crime syndicate, The Company, led by Wilford “Nappy” Pulawa, the first and only Hawaiian mob boss in history”.As well as echoing the themes of some of Scorsese’s best-known gangster films, the story appears to also share common ground with his most recent fictional feature, Killers of the Flower Moon, about the plight of the Osage people in 1920s America.The new book, says a statement, “aims to shed light not only on this chapter of American history but on Hawaii’s systematic theft by outsiders through the lens of this unique era.”Said Johnson: “This isn’t just a gangster story – it’s about power, identity, and what was taken from the Hawaiian people. What drew me to this project wasn’t just the action and the intensity. My own family lived through parts of this era, and I’ve seen first-hand the complicated legacy it left behind. Telling this story is a way to honour our Polynesian culture, and honour where we come from and share the untold history of what really happened in paradise.“My formative years were spent growing up in Honolulu, Hawai’i and this story is very personal – the more exhaustive research we do and people we speak to – the more I shake my head at how wildly and profoundly connected we all were. And still are.”Johnson made his nonfiction debut with a 2000 memoir, The Rock Says … which chronicles his pre-Hollywood life as well as sharing extensive life lessons and mottoes.Now 52, Johnson is one of the most financially successful film stars of all time thanks to his work on the Fast & Furious franchise and Disney’s Moana animations.His next film project is The Smashing Machine, an A24 sports biopic from Uncut Gems’ Benny Safdie in which he plays MMA fighter Mark Kerr, with Blunt playing his wife, Dawn.Explore more on these topicsFilmDwayne Johnson (The Rock)HawaiiTrue crime booksCrime filmsMartin ScorseseEmily BluntnewsShareReuse this content"

No cause of death was given.Katt began as a child actor with small roles in Gremlins and The ‘Burbs before becoming a regular in the films of Richard Linklater – appearing in Waking Life, SubUrbia, School of Rock andDazed and Confused, in which he played Clint Bruno, who assaults Adam Goldberg’s character, Mike.Linklater said after learning of Katt’s death: “Nicky had a deep love for the character actors of cinema history, and I think saw himself that way. When I was auditioning actors for Dazed and Confused, I’d ask them what character in the ensemble they most related to or were interested in, and the majority talked about the bigger parts, naturally. Nicky said he liked Clint. I almost didn’t know what he was talking about: ‘You mean the 17th largest part in the movie?’ ‘Yeah.’“He made something unique out of it, bringing his wicked humour, unpredictability, and smouldering quality to it. We worked up an entirely new scene for him and Matthew talking about car engines. I think he probably over-filled all his roles, which makes him memorable. Maybe he over-filled his life too, which, while often exasperating to those closest to him, makes him someone you’ll never forget. That brilliant spark will be missed.”For Steven Soderbergh, he appeared as Stacy the Hitman in The Limey, Hitler in Full Frontal and – in his last film appearance – in Behind the Candelabra.He also had small roles in two Christopher Nolan movies: Insomnia and The Dark Knight, as well as in Joel Schumacher’s A Time to Kill and Batman & Robin. Other film credits included The Way of the Gun, Christopher McQuarrie’s 2000 debut, Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof, as well as Sin City and Planet Terror for Robert Rodriguez, who became a friend.Rodriguez said: “You could always count on Nicky Katt for many things. He’d come in incredibly prepared for a role with costumes and props. He’d come full of inventive and creative ideas that would make his characters pop off the screen and consistently have an audience howling. He’d deliver lines that would constantly sound as unexpected as an ad lib, yet it was the text. And if he did ad lib, it was always gold. Even his physical comedy and timing was truly on another level.“Nicky was an absolute joy on and off the camera. A true artist. A friend. It’s very sad to lose Nicky Katt. But I can only be grateful I got to know him, work with him, and watch him create his own truly original brand of magic that will live for ever in his favourite medium.”For the past decade, Katt mostly worked on TV, playing popular teacher Harry Senate on the series Boston Public.Speaking in 2008 about his role in David Gordon Green’s Snow Angels, Katt said: “I kind of am notorious for bringing a lot of humour to stuff, and not in a scene-stealing way, [but] especially if something is really kind of heavy subject matter I’m kind of like oxygen for a drowning man.”“I mean, everyone also says that the bad guys are the most fun, but I’ve definitely gone through streaks where that’s all that people wanted me to play, the bad guy, especially after Dazed and Confused. But I’ve been really lucky because I get to play all different types of guys.”Other small screen appearances included Herbie: the Love Bug, Quincy, ME, Father Murphy and Law and Order. His last credit was in 2018, on the series Casual.Explore more on these topicsFilmRichard LinklaterDazed and ConfusednewsShareReuse this content"

There will be no price change for the standard PS5, which comes with a disk drive.The company cited “a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates” behind its decision to increase the retail price of the PS5 in some markets in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania.In Australia, the standard PS5 will rise to A$829.95, while the digital edition will increase to A$749.95. In New Zealand, the standard console will increase to NZ$949.95, and the digital to NZ$859.95..The technology industry has been grappling with the possible impact of President Trump’s tariffs on its supply chains. Rival Japanese game developer Nintendo unveiled its new handheld console, the Switch 2, the day before Trump launched his barrage of “reciprocal” tariffs on foreign goods on 2 April. A few days later, the company postponed preorders of the device in the US, as it said it would need to assess the potential effect of tariffs.Japan was hit with a 24% tariff on its exports to the US on Trump’s “liberation day” on 2 April. Like most of Trump’s new tariffs, they have been paused for 90 days. However, the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, said on Monday that his country did not plan to make big concessions in negotiations with the US and that it would not rush to reach a deal. Talks between the two governments are due this week.Companies such as Apple, whose products are largely assembled in China, are also bracing for higher costs. Analysts at the investment bank UBS have warned that the price of an iPhone 16 Max, with 256GB of storage,could rise 79% from $1,199 (£915) to about $2,150 (£1,600), based on a total tariff of 145%.While there is still a great deal of uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy, Japanese sharesrose on Mondayafter the US said it would pause levies on some electronics, including smartphones. Tokyo’s index of blue chip stocks, the Nikkei 225, closed up 1%.However, US officials said on Sunday that thepause on smartphones, laptops and other electronic products from import tariffs on China will be short-lived, with Trump warning on Sunday that no one was “getting off the hook”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Living a life that was as colourful as his fiction, Vargas Llosa also launched a failed bid for the Peruvian presidency, nursed a long-running feud with Gabriel García Márquez and triumphed as a Nobel laureate in 2010.Born in Arequipa in 1936, Vargas started working as a crime reporter when he was just 15. Four years later, he eloped with his 32-year-old aunt by marriage, Julia Urquidi, a departure his father called a “virile act”. A trip to Paris in 1958 was the beginning of 16 years abroad, living in Madrid, Barcelona and London as well as the French capital. But while working as a journalist, broadcaster and teacher, Vargas Llosa began to return to his homeland in fiction.Mario Vargas Llosa: a life in writingRead moreIn 1963 his first novel, The Time of the Hero, was published in Spain. But this story of a murder at the Leoncio Prado military academy – where Vargas Llosa spent two years as a teenager – and the subsequent cover-up was deemed so shocking in Peru that it is said that 1,000 copies were burned on the school’s parade ground.Vargas Llosa found himself at the centre of a boom in Latin American literature alongside writers such as Julio Cortázar, Carlos Fuentes and Garcia Márquez. His 1971 study, Garcia Márquez: Story of a Deicide, brought the literature of the new world into conversation with the old, but his friendship with the novelist didn’t last. When Garcia Márquez greeted Vargas Llosa outside a Mexico City cinema in 1976, he received a punch to the face in reply.Speaking at an event in Madrid, three years after Garcia Márquez died in 2014, Vargas Llosa said he was sad to hear of his former friend’s death but refused to elaborate on the reasons for the feud. “We’re moving toward dangerous ground,” he said. “The time has come to put an end to this conversation.”View image in fullscreenMario Vargas Llosa, pictrued on the election campaign trail in Lima, Peru, in 1990.Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex FeaturesPlays, short stories and novels including Conversation in the Cathedral, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, and The War of the End of the World confirmed his literary reputation. But as his profile grew, Vargas Llosa became increasingly involved in politics. Moving away from the Marxism of his youth, he hosted a chatshow on Peruvian television and, in 1984, turned down an offer from the conservative president Fernando Belaúnde Terry to become his prime minister.In 1987 Vargas Llosa drew a crowd of 120,000 to a rally in Lima protesting plans to nationalise the Peruvian financial system, and launched a presidential campaign. Three years later, after many abusive phone calls and death threats, he was defeated in the second round by Alberto Fujimori and left the country within hours.“I didn’t lie,”he told the Guardian in 2002. “I said we needed radical reforms and social sacrifices, and in the beginning it worked. But then came the dirty war, presenting my reforms as something that would destroy jobs. It was very effective, especially with the poorest of society. In Latin America we prefer promises to reality.”Vargas Llosa took up Spanish citizenship in 1993, as the stream of plays, essays and novels continued. The Feast of the Goat, published in 2000, entered the mind of the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo to chilling effect. His 2006 novel The Bad Girl follows an on-off affair that spans more than 40 years.View image in fullscreenMario Vargas Llosa receives the 2010 Nobel prize in literature from Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf at the Concert Hall in Stockholm, Sweden.Photograph: Claudio Bresciani/ReutersWhen the Swedish Academy called in 2010, Vargas Llosaat firstthought it was a joke. The Nobel prize was “a fairytale for a week”he told the Guardian in 2012, but “a nightmare for a year”, the public attention leaving him barely able to write: “You can’t imagine the pressure to give interviews, to go to book fairs.”The laureate used his new global platform to speak out againstmanipulation in the Peruvian media,propaganda from the Russian FederationandDonald Trump. However, in May 2022 he said that he would bebacking Brazil’s far-right former leader Jair Bolsonaroover Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brazil’s general election. Though the former president’s “clowning around” is “very difficult for a liberal to accept”, he explained that “between Bolsonaro and Lula, I of course prefer Bolsonaro. Even with Bolsonaro’s foolishness, he’s not Lula.”“I learned from my political experiences that I am a writer, not a politician,”Vargas Llosa explained to the Guardian in 2012. “Part of the reasons I have lived the life I have is because I wanted to have an adventurous life. But my best adventures are more literary than political.”View image in fullscreenMario Vargas Llosa poses for a photograph during a ceremony of his induction into the Academie Francaise (French Academy), in Paris, February 9, 2023. He was the first member never to have written a book in French.Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty ImagesFrom 1976 until 1979, Vargas Llosa served as president of PEN International, the worldwide writers’ freedom of expression group. Due to his objection to the Catalan independence movement, he resigned as emeritus president in 2019 after the organisation called for the release of two jailed Catalan civil society leaders and claimed Catalans had been persecuted “in a way not seen since the Franco dictatorship”.Despite the author’s international profile, he carried on making space for fiction, with four novels appearing after the Nobel prize. In 2023, he announced his newest novel Le dedico mi silencio (I Give You My Silence) would be his last, tellingLa Vanguardia, “Although I’m an optimist, I don’t think I’ll live long enough to work on a new novel, especially because it takes me three or four years to write one. But I’ll never stop working and I hope that I’ll have the strength to carry on until the end.”Vargas Llosa divorced his first wife in 1964 and married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa, mother to Álvaro, Gonzalo and Morgana. After 50 years of marriage, he left her in 2015 for Isabel Preysler, the mother of singer Enrique Iglesias, a relationship that ended in 2022.Explore more on these topicsMario Vargas LlosaFictionPeruAmericasNobel prize in literatureShareReuse this content"

Alison Hicks, an associate professor in library and information studies at UCL, interviewed 10 UK-based school librarians who had experienced book challenges. One “spoke of finding propaganda from one of these groups left on her desk”, while another “was directly targeted by one of these groups”. Respondents “also spoke of being trolled by US pressure groups on social media, for example when responding to free book giveaways”.It is “certainly possible that the scale of censorship we’re seeing in the US will influence the debate over here”, said Jewell. However, the level of influence to date is far from clear, particularly because the nature of censorship requests in the UK seems to differ from those brought forward in the US.Censorship by pupils in UK schools, including “vandalising library material, annotating library books with racist and homophobic slurs”, and damaging posters and displays was identified in Hicks’ study, which she wrote about in the spring issue of the SLA’s journal, The School Librarian. Such censorship “is not something I have seen in the US”, she said.The types of books targeted may also differ. “Almost all the UK attacks reported in my study centred on LGBTQ+ materials, while US attacks appear to target material related to race, ethnicity and social justice as well as LGBTQ+ issues,” said Hicks.While the study was small, the “LGBTQ focus of book challenges was undeniable”, wrote Hicks. Challenges were levelled against Alice Oseman’s Heartstopper series, about the love story of two British schoolboys, and “coded” narratives in books such as Billy’s Bravery by Tom Percival, about a boy who wants to dress up as his favourite superhero, Nature Girl.This supports the findings of anIndex on Censorship surveylast year, in which 28 of 53 librarians polled reported that they had been asked to remove books from library shelves, many of which were LGBTQ+ titles. In more than half of those cases, books were taken off shelves.However, a2023 study by Cilip, which found that a third of UK librarians had been asked by members of the public to censor or remove books, did identify themes of race and empire as among the most targeted, along with LGBTQ+.While there may be differences in how the challenges are playing out, “this should not take away from the huge impact these attacks are having” in the UK, said Hicks. “My research demonstrates that UK school librarians are facing equivalent levels of distress and hostility in the face of book ban challenges such as these.”In the US, book banning measures have been enacted across a number of states in recent years. “Library leaders in the UK are paying close attention to what’s happening in the US and there’s definitely a strong feeling of solidarity with American librarians,” said Jewell. Coiffait-Gunn of Cilip added that the profession “looks on with deep concern at the increasingly polarised and political debate” in the US about “what people, especially children, are allowed to read”.One cause for concern in the UK is the “lack of robust evidence” about how widespread censorship is, said Coiffait-Gunn. “It’s hard to evidence what doesn’t happen and which books are not available.” The government does not tally how many school libraries or librarians there are, “let alone track book bans”.Most UK libraries follow the Cilip ethical framework, which states that published materials should not be restricted on any grounds but the law, said Jewell. “That gives them the confidence and assurance to reject demands” for censorship.“What we must guard against is a climate where libraries avoid stocking certain books – or holding talks or activities – for fear of negative publicity, threats or intimidation,” he added. “It’s vital that libraries feel able to provide access to a wide range of perspectives if they are to facilitate the free exchange of ideas.”Explore more on these topicsLibrariesCensorshipShareReuse this content"

SNL had since apologised for the sketch, Wood added.Wood plays Chelsea in the third series ofThe White Lotus, which follows the lives of guests and staff at a luxury resort in Thailand as dark secrets are revealed and tensions rise over the course of the holiday.During the skit, titled White Potus, the series’ characters were replaced by depictions of Donald Trump and his inner circle.In later posts, Wood, who has also starred in Sex Education and Toxic Town, said: “Such a shame cuz I had such a great time watching it a couple weeks ago. Yes, take the piss for sure – that’s what the show is about – but there must be a cleverer, more nuanced, less cheap way?”Wood also later said she was “not thin skinned” and understood that SNL was about “caricature”.“But the whole joke was about fluoride,” she added. “I have big gap teeth not bad teeth. The rest of the skit was punching up and I/Chelsea was the only one punched down on.”She added: “On a positive note, everyone is agreeing with me about it so I’m glad I said something instead of going in on myself.”In arecent GQ Hype interview, Wood said the conversation about her appearance made her “a bit sad” as she was “not getting to talk about my work”.On Instagram, she also addressed confusion over the interview, clarifying that her comments about feeling “ugly” stemmed from her own insecurities, not from anything said byHBO.In the interview, Wood explained how Mike White, the White Lotus creator, was said to have fought to cast her, which had made her feel insecure. “That was my own paranoid thought,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAimee Lou WoodSaturday Night LiveThe White LotusUS televisionTV comedyComedyTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t that he’d made a mistake; rather, he had to get serious for a second. “How the fuck is everyone doing?” he asked, before reiterating for the second time already how thankful he was, how he hopes “everyone is taking care of themselves and having a great fucking night.” The 29-year-old singer, so adept at shape-shifting that he has bounced from trap to hip-hop to pop to rock to country in less than a decade, maintains at least one consistency: with an exceedingly foul mouth and a beer in hand, he will always be polite. He will check in. He will refer humbly to the “ladies and gentlemen”, even when asking “how fucking bitchin’ is it to be able to come here and play for you tonight?”Green Day at Coachella review – fun but muddled set pokes fun at American IdiotsRead moreThat warmhearted goofball from high school you still want to party with, who also happens to be one of the most-listened to artists in the world? Such is the appeal of the musician born Austin Richard Post, a self-styled party guy who just wants to have a good time, so redolent with good vibes that he’s the only conceivable person who could collaborate with Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen in one year. You could see said appeal working theCoachellacrowd on Sunday night – the youngest-skewing of the headliners by far, Post being one of gen Z’s top avatars for the good life: fame, fortune, freedom from boundaries, wearing one’s heart on one’s sleeve but keeping it chill. This is, after all, a man who started out on Soundcloud and credits the video game Guitar Hero for inspiring him to go into music. He speaks the language of dreams and passions and fun, not ego or self-seriousness.Those good vibes translated on Sunday night, even for those not necessarily inclined to follow him on a straight road to Americana. Post possesses one of the most versatile and chameleonic voices in music, but Sunday’s show leaned twangy as an act built aroundF-1 Trillion, the Texas native’s beers and bros country album released last year with a slew of Nashville collaborators. Post strutted around a stage styled like a highway exit, as if country were merely a pit stop on the open road of musical style; both artist and band sported trucker hats. It’s a transformation of obvious signifiers, though delivered with such enthusiasm as to feel sincere.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Christopher Polk/Billboard/Getty ImagesThat the music was often so full-bodied and steamrolling as to make Post’s words indecipherable, his glassy voice overwhelmed by big, bruising guitar licks and bigger pyrotechnics, mattered little to the crowd screaming along to late 2010s hits Circles, Congratulations and Rockstar, or line dancing to new song M-E-X-I-C-O. This was open-hearted effort by a superstar, a man of the people who paused singing to chug from a solo cup and apologized multiple times for “being a bit pitchy” after giving up autotune. (To my untrained ears, he sounded like autotune already.)The 90-minute set, spanning first release White Iverson to latest hit single I Had Some Help (sans Morgan Wallen – and no, Taylor and Beyoncé of course did not show, nor did their songs), barreled through turbocharged track after turbocharged track with a general twang and an emphasis on, as Post called it, “shredding”. The effect veered between numbing cacophony and invigorating wall of sound, peaking when Post let his naturally sanitized voice open up and splinter over songs such as I Fall Apart and Goodbyes. For as much easygoing charm as he brings to the table, Post often seemed to be entertaining through sheer force of will.During his penultimate number, singing from a shredded highway billboard at the front of the catwalk, Post recalled when he was once dismissed as a one-hit wonder with an immediate pivot to the masses: “I want you doing what you fucking love and love who you love and love what you love and keep fucking doing it, ’cause there’s no one on this fucking planet who can fucking tell you shit!” People with phone cameras aloft flocked to him, this creative beacon and pop music enigma brought to his knees in service of the audience and the occasion. “Don’t let anybody fucking stop you, becauseno one can fucking stop you,” he screamed, before one more polite nod to the ladies and gentlemen of the desert.Explore more on these topicsCoachellaPost MaloneFestivalsPop and rockreviewsShareReuse this content"

MacGregor herself isa familiar interpreterof the obbligato piano part, which here was played by her former pupil, Australian pianist-composerJoseph Havlat, while MacGregor conducted the symphony with considerable fire and brilliance. Cynthia Millar, meanwhile, was theondes martenotsoloist.Completed in 1948, and inspired by Messiaen’s fascination with various versions of the legend of Tristan and Iseult, Turangalîla is essentially an examination of sexual and spiritual love, in which consuming desire can be seen at once as affording access to the divine and bringing in its wake the potential for suffering or destruction. Though a devout Catholic, Messiaen was no prude, and music of deep sensuality and carnality gives way throughout to ecstatic dances of cosmic jubilation and moments of incipient menace.MacGregor and the BPO captured the work’s emotional immediacy, hypnotic force and sense of almost tangible physicality to compelling effect. Textures gleamed and glistened, rhythms were crisp, precise, superbly articulated. Joie du Sang des Étoiles, taken fractionally faster than we sometimes hear it, sounded thrilling in its elation and drive. Jardin du Sommeil d’Amour, the work’s effective slow movement, was all drowsy sensuousness, the strings silky; the piano solo, suggestive of birdsong, exquisitely done by Havlat, whose playing combined shimmering elegance with intensity throughout.Millar matched his rapt introversion here. Just occasionally, however, the balance between them came adrift elsewhere, and the ondes martenot’s moans and whoops sounded fractionally too distant. The work’s brief moments of darkness were chillingly realised, though, particularly the seventh (itself entitled Turangalîla 2) of the work’s 10 movements, where brass, ondes and piano are brought into stark opposition. Turangalîla is, of course, very much a showpiece for a virtuoso orchestra, and the Brighton Philharmonic – its members drawn from the principal players of London’s orchestras together with young musicians – played with terrific panache and commitment. Heady stuff, beautifully done.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Her sharp observations and crackling dialogue were evident in her earlier playwriting, too and, in director Rhiann Jeffery’s taut new production, feel fresh and current.Striking a note of distress in the opening moments as a small boy raises a knife, tension escalates from there. The unannounced arrival of an Irish nanny to their elegant London home is the catalyst for exposing trouble in the marriage of pregnant ex-lawyer Hazel (Lisa Dwyer Hogg) and her globe-trotting husband Richard (Mark Huberman), a cosmetic surgeon. What ensues is so tense that the audience was audibly inhaling, as the child, Daniel (Milo Payne; alternating with Canice Doran) is drawn into the couple’s power games. The initially unflappable nanny, Annie (Jeanne Nicole Ní Áinle), finds herself adjudicating between them all.With a single setting of a sleek kitchen designed with sharp geometry by Maree Kearns, a sense of dread is maintained by Garth McConaghie’s rumbling sound design and Sarah Jane Shiels’ lighting, as the dark stage is framed in flashes of neon. Amid lies and blazing accusations, each of these characters is allowed to be credibly contradictory: both selfish and unselfish. For all her painful childhood experiences, Annie is not a victim. Even Richard, the egotistical doctor who constantly undermines Hazel, has kind, even endearing, aspects in Huberman’s nuanced performance.Above all, Dwyer Hogg’s characterisation of Hazel as a highly ambitious, clever woman who fears she is not capable of taking care of her son, is sympathetic and complex. With a second child about to be born, she seems to be conducting a risky life experiment. The conflict between parental responsibility and being professionally fulfilled is not resolved here, an inclusiveness that gives the play its heft.AtLyric, Belfast, until 4 MayExplore more on these topicsTheatreParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Deploying a fly-on-the-wall approach, Karolina Domagalska’s dynamic film closely follows the tireless efforts ofAbortion Dream Team(ADT), an advocacy group founded in 2016. Forming a staunch resistance to oppressive legislation, they provide medical consultancy and assistance to tens of thousands of women who can no longer access abortion services legally.The hotline never stops ringing. Abandoned by the healthcare system, women from all overPolandreach out to the ADT volunteers, who guide them through these moments of uncertainty and confusion with extraordinary care. In addition to abortion pills and emergency contraceptives, the group also provides logistics support to those who need to travel to other countries for critical procedures. Every day comes not only with this flood of cries for help, but also an onslaught of threats and abuse from anti-abortion supporters. In one harrowing scene, the activists confront a group of policemen about a moving bus plastered with the faces of ADT associates, branding them as so-called murderers. The law, however, is not on their side. Justyna, one of their core members, was put on trial and convicted for distributing abortion pills.Shot in tight closeup, Domagalska’s documentary brilliantly conveys the unseen psychological toll of this social work. At the same time, the film overflows with the joy of activism. In their playful video campaigns, ADT members deliberately counter the stigmas surrounding abortion with spirited humour. In one scene that parodies Baywatch, the activists, dressed in all red, break into laughter as they sprint down a sandy beach. They, too, are on a mission to save lives, one phone call at a time.AbortionDream Team is on Viaplay from 21 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsAbortionPolandEuropeHealthWomenreviewsShareReuse this content"

This film is an omnibus recap of the 2024 TV anime’s first season, directed by Tomomi Kamiya and Shigeyuki Miya, and tacking on a new 20-minute episode. Taking place in a high-school-style training academy for anti-kaiju troops, it plays like Pacific Rim meets Starship Troopers meets The Incredible Hulk.Kafka (voiced by Masaya Fukunishi) wants to join the Defense Force like his childhood buddy Mina (Asami Seto), who has become the kaiju-reaping star of the outfit. But having flunked the entrance exam, he is stuck as part of the cleanup crews who dispose of city blocks’ worth of gore after the battles – and is normally assigned intestine detail to boot. After newbie faeces-mopper Reno (Wataru Kato) encourages him to reapply and they both scrape through, Kafka is invaded by a parasite that allows him to transform into a hench skull-headed kaiju; an alter ego he must, of course, conceal from his new colleagues.From the power fixation (they are assigned special suits that augment them in proportion to their natural abilities) to the petty rivalries between recruits, there is little that is new here for connoisseurs of the likes of My Hero Academia. But it is underpinned by a pressing social anxiety, with thirtysomething “old dude” Kafka desperately playing catch-up to join the warrior elite; his specialist knowledge of kaiju anatomy swings things in his favour. And Kamiya and Miya execute it all with an addictive punky relish, starting with a bestiary – from human-headed spider-demons to wyverns and proliferating fungal colonies – unfailingly eviscerated with maximum overkill.Though the character work is at times rudimentary, Kamiya and Miya keep things interesting by mixing up animation styles: sophisticated 3D urban fly-bys (the studio is Ghost in the Shell’s Production IG),kaomoji-style cutaways for extreme emotional reactions (there are many), and an almost expressionist rawness in the fury of battle that meshes with Yûta Bandoh’s strident score and the odd LOL proclamation from Kafka: “I’m gonna try punching it as hard as I can!” After 90 minutes of this fast-forward kaiju-trouncing, the bonus episode – about deputy captain Hoshina’s day off – is soothing, if sentimental, respite.Kaiju No 8: Mission Recon is in UK cinemas from 16 April, and is in Australian cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeJapanAsia PacificreviewsShareReuse this content"

It seems as if it is going to be a thriller or supernatural mystery, and you can wait almost until the final credits for some final narrative flourish or definitive plot shock that would prove what it’s all been about. And in fact there is a revelation, but it is presented so coolly that you will be expecting something else to come afterwards. An unsympathetic producer might well want to cut this film by two-thirds and present it as an episode of Roald Dahl’s Tales of the Unexpected, but that would be to lose the flavour and perhaps the meaning. I’m still not sure what I think about Eclipse, but it’s certainly distinctive.Tom Conti plays Tom, a thoughtful, gentle man whose sailing expedition off the Scottish coast with his twin brother Geoffrey (played by Conti with aPeter Wyngardemoustache) has ended in a tragic drowning. As he explains to the inquest, in the darkness caused by an eclipse, he lost control of the craft and his brother accidentally fell overboard, hitting his head which explains the corpse’s grisly wound. Some time later, Tom visits Geoffrey’s beautiful widow Cleo (played by Gay Hamilton, from Kubrick’s Barry Lyndon), with whom he is clearly in love, and her young son Giles who adores his good-natured uncle.And from there? The action drifts uneventfully onward, in what feels like real time. Cleo has a very peculiar full-frontal nude portrait of her late husband on the wall, but Tom claims that the man shown has his own, slighter, physique. Cleo’s drinking problem is revealed, and she is clearly suffering from depression. There is a sex scene which is skipped over and then partly revealed in flashback, as well as a horrifying moment from Tom’s past; finally there are some scenes of the fatal boat journey, with some discussion of Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment. To the very end, Tom’s relationships with Geoffrey and Cleo are not clearly depicted, but indirectly and rather bafflingly hinted at. It is an intriguing film, though perhaps the film’s residual enigma is stubbornly out of focus.Eclipse is on digital platforms and Blu-Ray from 21 April.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It starts with a flashback scene, signalling major trouble ahead, but, in the present, Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey) have been settled in a thriving community in Wyoming for the past five years. Joel’s most pressing problem now is that he feels emotionally estranged from 19-year-old Ellie (Ramsey) – who hasn’t told anyone about her immunity to the virus.

Don’t miss the prawn curry (€14) or the prawnbalchão(a spicy, sour tomato-chilli sauce, €15) and leave room for the ice-cream – cinnamon and ginger or mango – made by Débora.Open Tues-Sat, Sunlunch only, closedMon, onFacebookCanalhaA year and a half after it opened, Canalha is still the talk of the town. Located in the west of the city, close to Belém, chef João Rodrigues, known for the Michelin-starredFeitoria, is at the helm. He is passionate about sourcing the very best produce (hisProjecto Matériawebsite maps producers he rates from all over Portugal) and in Canalha he has created a casual dining place with exceptional cuisine, seen in both rustic daily lunchtime specials and more elaborate dishes. With Lívia Orofino as the resident chef, Canalha has just landed a Bib Gourmand award. The fresh grilled squid with sheep butter (€25) and the open shrimp egg tortilla (€18) are pure joys. Sit at the counter to be close to the action – it’s like being at a chef’s table.Opendaily,paradigma.ptPigmeuView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joana FreitasA neighbourhood restaurant in Campo de Ourique, in the west of Lisbon, Pigmeu has a nose-to-tail approach and keeps things simple, offering high quality Alentejo pork, delicious vegetables and natural wines in a relaxed atmosphere. Chef and entrepreneur Miguel Azevedo Peres sources organic meat and vegetables directly from local farmers to promote responsible food consumption. Recently he introduced a good value set lunch menu, with a snack, starter and main for €17. The lunch menu changes every week, but you can always rely on thecroquetes, pork sandwich (€10) andtorresmo do rissol(crispy pork crackling). Pigmeu holds a Michelin Bib Gourmand.ClosedSun,pigmeu.ptMãe – Cozinha com AmorView image in fullscreenThe name translates as “Mother – Cooking with Love” and the walls of this spacious restaurant in Estefânia are covered with photos of the mothers of staff and clients. Chef João Diogo Mendes creates comfort food with a twist, many dishes are based on his mum’s recipes, and those of his business partner Raimundo Ferreira. The fish and prawn rice and duck rice (€18) are a contemporary take on a Portuguese staple (we’re the biggest consumers of rice per capita in Europe). Their mothers would be impressed.Open daily, Sunlunch only,onInstagramPradoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Joana FreitasChef António Galapito has been at Prado for seven years but is still creating some of the most exciting dishes in the city with local, seasonal produce (most of it organic). His clever cuisine celebrates the best of Portugal with influences from farther afield (Galapito previously worked in London with Nuno Mendes). The modern plant-filled space in Baixa is flooded with fabulous natural light and serves natural and organic wines. On a recent visit, I loved the sweet potato snack with mussels and curry, as well as the marinated mackerel with green apple and olive (€16). The whole Prado team, led by Inês Pereira, is charming and welcoming.Thurs-Satlunch, Tues-Satdinner,pradorestaurante.comGarum Fish & Wine BarView image in fullscreenFish and shellfish become extra special in the hands of chefs Filipe Rodrigues and Hugo Gouveia. The two started creating delights using Japanese techniques atA Taberna do Marin the pretty and historic neighbourhood of Graça,and have continued at Garum, its new sister restaurant, next door. Expect fun and bold flavours, with a focus on the Roman condimentgarum, a fermented fish sauce (made from umami-rich brined sardines – plus a lot of experimenting over the years). Rodrigues is now having fun dry-ageing fish such as tuna and seabass from the Azores islands for about 20 days. The seabass rice (€16) is the bestseller, and don’t miss the dessert of carob petit gateau, fig ice-cream and reduction of Carcavelos wine.ClosedSunand Mon, onInstagramPetisco SaloioPetisco Saloio in Campo Pequeno is one of the moderntascas(small, local restaurants serving traditional, simple fare with a focus on quick lunches) emerging across the city. Its two young chefs, Diogo Meneses and Carlos Pinheiro, previously had careers in fine dining but realised that family-style cooking was what made them happy. It’s a favourite place for dishes such as the ubiquitousbitoque(steak with sauce, chips and rice, topped with a fried egg) at lunchtime. The two daily specials (fish or meat) cost €13 (go after 2pm when office workers are back at their desks). At dinner, the menu is broader, withpetiscos(small sharing plates) ranging from pork cheek sandwich (€8) to octopus stew with beans and sausage (€14).Closed Sat lunch and Sun, onInstagramExplore more on these topicsLisbon holidaysRestaurantsFood and drinkCity breaksPortugal holidaysEurope holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And ready in about half an hour, tooRukmini IyerMon 14 Apr 2025 08.00 EDTShareThis is one of my favourite recipes for this column so far. Light, fresh goat’s cheese and artichokes baked in a tart with a smooth, herb-packed base and finished with hazelnuts; I especially like the contrast of the crisp filo against the filling. There are a lot of herbs here, but they balance beautifully, so I’d advise using them all, particularly the chives. (I bought 30g packs of mint and basil, but by the time I had got rid of the stems, there were just 20g leaves left. My herb windowsill is lavish with rosemary, sage and oregano, but sadly not the soft herbs yet.)Goat’s cheese, herb and hazelnut spring tartYou want a soft, rindless goat’s cheese for this.Prep20 minCook25 minServes430g flat-leaf parsley, leaves and stems20g mint, leaves only20g basil, leaves only15g chives100g shelled hazelnuts,half very roughly chopped, the rest left whole1tsp sea salt flakes3mediumeggs4sheets filo pastry280g jar artichokes in oil, drained and oil reserved125g log rindless soft goat’s cheeseHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the parsley, mint, basil, most of the chives (reserve a few to finish), the whole hazelnuts, salt and eggs into a high-speed blender, then blitz for a minute, until very smooth and the consistency of double cream.Line a 24-25cm round pie dish with crumpled baking paper (crumpling will mean you can push it into the round edges of the dish). Lay a sheet of the filo over the paper, brush generously with some of the reserved artichoke oil, then lay a second sheet of filo on top at a 90-degree angle. Brush this with oil, then repeat with the remaining two sheets of filo. Once all the filo is in the dish, crumple up the edges a little to create a lip.Pour the green mixture into the pastry, scraping out any last bits from the blender, then arrange the drained artichokes on top. Top them with teaspoonfuls of goat’s cheese (it’s too soft to crumble, so I break off teaspoon-sized bits). Scatter over the chopped hazelnuts, then bake for 25 minutes.Remove from the oven, and leave the tart to settle and cool for 10 minutes. Finely chop the reserved chives, scatter over the top of the tart and serve warm.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyCheeseSpring food and drinkPastryBakingMain courseEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

You’d better believe it, plus it’s inspired by an Italian culinary legendRachel RoddyMon 14 Apr 2025 06.00 EDTShareWriting in 1891, in his cooking manualLa Scienza in Cucina e L’arte di Mangiar Bene(Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well),Pellegrino Artusiintroduces the potato as a tuber from thesolanaceae(nightshade) family that was native to South America and introduced to Europe in the 16th century. He goes on to note that large-scale cultivation didn’t begin in Italy until the beginning of the 18th century, due to the “obstinacy of the masses who were averse to eating it”, adding that, little by little, the potato became more than accepted (by the poor as well as the rich), because of its good taste, ability to satisfy hunger and the way it lent itself to being cooked in so many ways.If my counting is correct, of 790 recipes in that seminal book, 30 of them include potatoes or a significant proportion of potato flour. What is especially interesting is that even though the first recipe that includes potatoes is recipe 14 (a tasty-sounding brothy minestra with little gnocchi made from potatoes, boiled chicken, yolks and cheese), plus 14 more savoury potato recipes that Artusi waits to introduce, it isn’t until the chapter entitledTorte e dolci al Cucchiaio(Cakes and Desserts Eaten with a Spoon) that the potato is formally presented. In recipe 661,budino di patate, a soft, blancmange-style pudding that definitely requires a spoon, is made from floury potatoes, sugar, eggs, milk and lemon zest. In that same chapter, and the preceding biscuit and pastry chapter, 13 other recipes also include potatoes or potato flour: three types of biscuit, two souffles, a bake with amaretti biscuits, a shortcrust-type pastry, a sweet focaccia, another sweet bread, another budino (this time with almonds), and three cakes.In the first of those three cakes, potato supports almonds and chocolate. In the second, potato flour thickens alongside almond flour to make a frangipane. But it is the third cake that is a full-ontorta di patate(potato cake), which is prefaced by the best sort of Artusi introduction: observant, funny and anticipating anyone who might be suspicious (or contemptuous) of the cake, and also encouraging readers to try it for themselves. He certainly convinced me, not least because this cake also contains almonds, melted butter, five eggs andlotsof lemon zest. I have learned from a slightly less successful (but still more than acceptable) attempt that the more floury the potatoes, the lighter the texture. I would go so far as to describe this cake as bouncy, even, satisfying in its texture, and a brilliant lesson in the potato’s farinaceous chameleon capacity. The method is very straightforward.Artusi’s serving suggestion is to bake the cake and serve it later. My own suggestion is to leave the cake to cool completely, then cut it in half horizontally to make a lid and a base. Spread the base with three or four tablespoons of lemon curd, jam or jelly, then cover with the cake lid. Mix a tablespoon (or more, to taste) of icing sugar and the finely grated zest of another unwaxed lemon into a 250g tub of thick cream or mascarpone, then spread this thickly on top of your potato cake.Almond and potato cake with lemon curd and mascarponeMakes1 cake, for 8-12500g floury potatoes, ideally of roughly the same size5 eggs130g sugar140g ground almonds50g melted butter, plus extra for greasingGrated zest of 2 large unwaxed lemons2 tsp baking powderA pinch of salt3-4 tbsp lemon curd, or lemon jam250g tub mascarpone, or thick cream1 tbsp icing sugarPeel and quarter the potatoes, then steam or boil until tender.

Bake at 170C (150C fan)/340F/gas 3½ for an hour, until a skewer or dry spaghetti strand inserted into the centre comes out clean.Leave the cake to cool completely, then cut it in half horizontally to make a lid and a base. Spread the lemon curd on the base half , then top with the lid. For the top, you can simply dust it with icing sugar; alternatively, mix the remaining lemon zest and the icing sugar into a tub of thick mascarpone or cream and spread that thickly on the top.Explore more on these topicsCakeA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkBakingCheeseEggsDessertrecipesShareReuse this content"
