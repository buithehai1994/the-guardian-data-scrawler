Shame the Traitors don’t run BritainMarina HydeThe Celebrity Traitors drew to a magnificent close this week – and proved that these lying double-crossers are of a far finer calibre than our MPsThis article contains spoilers about the final episode of The Celebrity TraitorsFri 7 Nov 2025 09.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 12.51 ESTShareTheCelebrity Traitors finalwas so good that the TV moment of the year (Nick revealing he’d written Joe’s name on his slate) only held its crown for six minutes before the actual TV moment of the year (Alan revealing he’d been a traitor all along) completely stole it. Epic congratulations to Alan, a full-spectrum entertainment booking, who from the first minutes of this season catapulted himself to the status of high-value national treasure, while Joe Marler also leapfrogged 27 stardom categories in the public imagination and should now be made Duke of York. And look, it wasn’t all bad for historian and Guardian Scott Trust board member David Olusoga. Thanks to the deputy PM and justice secretary, he was only the second mostspectacularly wrong Davidof the week.But why am I bringing politics into it? After all, one of the most remarkable shifts I haven’t been able to help noticing during this epic first run of TheCelebrityTraitors is that no senior politician has attempted to refer to the show as a way of currying public favour. They’d certainly get short shrift if they tried. But this represents a radical break with the past 20 years, where politicians and prime ministers became transfixed by the popularity of reality TV. In the first twisted heyday of the genre, politicians really thought it was the answer and they could steal its best bits to succeed in their own trade. Now I think that even they realise a show like The Celebrity Traitors is the thing people escape to in an age when none of our leaders have any answers.Only one man – the biggest reality TV star of that first golden era – instinctively understood the explosively popular new genre’s dynamics and true meaning and import, and bent them to his will. He is now enjoying a second residency, not in Vegas, but in the White House. Vladimir Putin also got it. But in the anglophone world, all the other politicians had reality TV totally wrong.Wronger than Kate Garraway, if that puts it into perspective.Even so, their dances with the genre make for fascinating cultural history. It seems mad to recall, but Gordon Brown was so convinced by his vision for something called “an X Factor Britain” that as prime minister hewrote personal lettersto all the 2008 finalists of Simon Cowell’s ITV talent show, while dealing with the global financial crisis. Alexandra Burke won. (That year’s X Factor– not the global financial crisis.) A few months earlier, the then PM had made anappearance on American Idol. Brown was even approached to be a judge himself, on a show provisionally entitled Junior PM that was pitched for BBC One. One of his secretaries of state was photographed carrying a printed email about this proposed format to a cabinet meeting. This contained the producers’ pitch for a show that would make the prime minister “more popular than Sir Alan Sugar” – !!! – in a space aimed at the “Apprentice meets Maria meets Strictly Come Dancing” audience. The Tories promptly gave Strictly host Bruce Forsyth a ticket to watch the next PMQs in the Commons public gallery, where they kept shouting “you’re fired!” at Brown.By the David Cameron era, Cowell’s endorsement was regarded as so market-moving that the Sunsplashed his backingfor Cameron on the morning before the 2010 election. Cowell himself was convincedreferendums were the future, claiming that local editions of his reality show in non-democracies or fragile ones, such as Afghanistan, had “given democracy back to the world”. It was striking how often those who had risen via reality television were deemed the answer. Prospect magazine voted Russell Brand the fourth most influential political thinker in the world in 2015. (This was the same year he askedwould-be Labour prime ministerEd Miliband: “Since suffrage, since the right to vote, what has meaningfully occurred?”)It’s notable that The Traitors, like the original US Apprentice (and its UK spin-off), are not shows in which there is a public vote. But so many were, and there was much to be read into the way in which a significant section of the public was casting its ballots, if only we had extrapolated it. The always entertainingly brilliant Alwyn Turner digs into this inAll in It Together, his history of England in the 21st century. First, you had the public repeatedly pressing the fuck-you button andvoting for John Sergeantevery week on Strictly. The former BBC political correspondent’s dancing was terrible, but voters knew that backing him would incense the elites trying to push them in different directions. I will not be taking questions on this opinion, but … this was the Brexit vote foreshadowed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Claudia Winkleman was 51% trusted, against Rachel Reeves on 15%. Carr (the most recognisable star among the public, it found) scored 50% trust against 22% for Nigel Farage. It would be fun to see how those numbers have changed over the past month.The other big thing that has changed decisively in recent times is the calibre of people attracted to primetime reality TV. The lineup for The Celebrity Traitors was hugely impressive, and final confirmation that, when highly produced, this genre’s reputation as a home for has-beens is totally dead. The Celebrity Traitors was the ultimate prestige format, and will be even more so after this series. As for the high-profile place this country now seems to send its low-calibre people … well, I think even the wrongest faithful could work out the answer to that.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistA year in Westminster: John Crace, Marina Hyde and Pippa CrerarOn Tuesday 2 December, join Crace, Hyde and Crerar as they look back at another extraordinary year, with special guests, live at the Barbican in London and livestreamed globally.

The problem? “No one would play the character!” he says, sitting, impeccably suited as always, in a room at London’s Corinthia Hotel. As it turns out, the material was just waiting for the right actor. Step upMatt Smithto play the titular sex-addicted travelling makeup salesman.It’s not surprising that it ended up being Smith. Since his Doctor Who days, he has tended to pick roles that trend slightly twisted – and the role of Bunny, who in Cave’s book is depicted as a borderline animalistic misogynist who sweats pure ethanol, fits the bill entirely. “I think it’s important to tell stories that feel challenging and difficult and polarising, and I thought this would be all of those things,” Smith says animatedly, clad in head-to-toe black in contrast with Bunny’s rakish suit. “But actually, at its heart, it’s about a father and son, and it’s really beautiful.”First published in 2009 – after initially being written as a film script for Australian director John Hillcoat – The Death of Bunny Munro follows a sex-obsessed salesman who, after driving his wife to suicide through his constant infidelity, kidnaps his bookish son (played brilliantly by Rafael Mathé) when social services attempt to take him away, and brings him on a surreal road trip around Sussex.The book is defined by Bunny’s shocking inner monologue and seemingly amoral view of the world; the Sky adaptation, directed by Isabella Eklöf and written by Pete Jackson, presents a slightly toned-down take. A lot of the sex is conveyed through sound and dialogue; some moments from the book, such as Bunny’s rape of a woman who is under the influence of heroin – a scene for which Cave was nominated for theBad Sex award– are implied rather than depicted in lurid detail. This results in a slightly more sympathetic Bunny, though he is still an undeniable creep, willing to abandon his child for long spells to seduce bored housewives, and intent on teaching his son how to be a lech.View image in fullscreen‘I changed every swear word to frig or flip or sugar’ … Bunny Munro (Matt Smith) and Bunny Junior (Rafael Mathé).Photograph: Sarah Weal/Sky UK, Clerkenwell FilmsBeing set in 2003, the show is also an endearing period piece, filled with clunky Nokias and classic Kylie tracks blaring out of car radios. Smith says he feels the show is “a really faithful adaptation”, though he acknowledges that the book, which is mired in Bunny’s almost free-associative thoughts about women, was incredibly tricky to film. “The pollution of his thoughts, and the danger of his thoughts, are really difficult to translate to a character that you’re going to stick with,” he says.Bunny’s uniqueness, though, was fundamentally appealing. “I thought the language of the book was beautiful – I read it quite quickly, and I was like: ‘Wow,fuck.This is gonna be a challenge, because he’s pretty out there, but what a great challenge.’ I’d rather do that than something that feels predictable,” says Smith. “He’s quite an operatic character – he’s out there and does mad shit – and they’re the ones that I’m drawn to, otherwise we’re just left with this homogenised, dumbed-down nonsense where no one pushes it too far. This felt really original.”Although Smith declines to identify what he deems “dumbed-down nonsense”, he does elaborate: “I think we have a tendency to overexplain and try to predict people’s tastes in telly sometimes,” he says. “‘Let’s make it so everyone likes it,’ you know? Some people will like this, some people won’t – I’m totally fine with that.”Cave feels that Smith’s version of Bunny Munro is “more transgressive than my version, because my version is just a lost individual and a terrible person, and he’s not attractive and he’s not good at what he does.” Smith, on the other hand? “The problem with Matt is that he’s handsome and sexy, and that makes the whole thing slightly more dubious, because he’s doing the same things,” says Cave. “But women actually like it in the show – you can see the sort of pulling power that he has, and I find that more discomfiting in a way. There’s something about the fact that Matt is hot that is quite problematic.”View image in fullscreenAll ears … Matt Smith as Bunny Munro.Photograph: Sky UK, Clerkenwell FilmsMathé, who plays Bunny’s nine-year-old son Bunny Jr, is one of the highlights of The Death of Bunny Munro, holding his own even when paired with the go-for-broke Smith. Smith says that working with a child actor on such explicit material was an eye-opening experience for him. “We were really lucky in that we had a brilliant young actor in Raf, who’s smart and understood the emotional complexity of the story, even at such a young age,” he says. “You have to be careful about what you reveal to him – so, for instance, you shoot the scene in the strip joint with the beers and strippers and the naked people first, and then he comes in, and he doesn’t see any of that.”He continues: “So you’re shooting two sides of a coin all the time. And then I would swear on my takes, and on his takes, I’d say the word frig or flip or sugar. It was the first time I’ve ever been in a story where children have had to witness that level of depravity, and you’ve got to be conscious that he’s nine years old,” he says. “Even if it is a story, you don’t want to expose him too early to things he shouldn’t be anywhere near. But his parents were amazing, and they navigated that whole thing beautifully – we really looked after him. Without him, there’d be no show really.”The Death of Bunny Munro is, in some senses, a morality tale – a tragedy about a man whose appetites, and inability to care for his family, eventually send him to ruin. Around the time of the book’s release, Cave said he was inspired by a certain kind of British man who’s “laddish, sex-obsessed, thinks that breasts are kind of funny”, and that he wanted to show where that kind of misogyny could lead. Cave says he doesn’t “really relate to that quote any more. I don’t stand in judgment of Bunny Munro any more. I just have a different way of seeing people, and part of that is that we are essentially broken, all of us, to lesser or greater degrees,” he says. “I think we live in a time where there’s a feeling that we should be condemning the transgressive personality wherever we see it, and I find that personally quite difficult to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I recognise a lot of different men in him,” he says. “He’s a really complicated, deeply troubled, sad human being. He’s in the nexus of this tornado of grief.”Now is the perfect time for a Bunny Munro series, says Cave, because of that feeling. “I think the world is hungry for things that step outside the expectations of our culture these days – I just get the feeling that people are looking at ways to test the puritanical nature of our present culture,” he says. “Especially with young people – I’m surrounded by young people because I have kids in their early 20s, and they’re much looser and freer about things these days, and they take a certain pride in that. I think that’s good, as far as I’m concerned – that encourages a more healthy, artistic, free society.”The Bunny Munro book was considered controversial on its release, in part because of the sexually charged, objectifying way Bunny fixates on Kylie Minogue and Avril Lavigne. Cave ended up apologising to both women on BBC 6Music, although he says “that may have been tongue in cheek. I never met Avril Lavigne, and I hope she isn’t really offended, or was not embarrassed by that – I would really hate that. I hope she wasn’t upset – maybe she just thought it was funny,” he says. “I know Kylie, I asked Kylie what she thought, and she was like: ‘Well, I’ve actually not read your book yet.’ And this went on for years. She says: ‘It’s next to my bed, but I haven’t got around to it.’ So I don’t know if she ever really read it, but I guess she still likes me.”The pure transgression of Bunny as a character – which led to such controversy after the novel was published – is what attracted Smith to the role in the first place, and why he’s thrilled he got to play him. “It’s always been hard to find parts like Bunny Munro; they’re rare, really rare. That’s the type of stuff I’ve always been interested in,” he says. “I remember all that in-your-face theatre in the 90s, I used to love all that. There was something about it that’s appalling … but it made me sit on the edge of my seat. That’s what Bunny can do.”The Death of Bunny Munro is on Sky Atlantic on20 November.The Death of Bunny Munro by Nick Cave (Canongate Books, £9.99).

Or at least the preparation. Democrats, along with many others around the world, cheered this week’s wins in a clutch of off-year elections that saw Donald Trump’s Republicansdefeated from sea to shining sea. But now they need to brace themselves for the reaction. Because Donald Trump does not like losing. And he will do everything he can to ensure it does not happen again – by means fair and, more often, foul. Indeed, that effort is already under way.For now, the Democrats are still clinking glasses, enjoying a success that tastes all the sweeter for coming exactly a year after they lost everything – the House, the Senate and the White House – to a returning and triumphant Trump. The most dramatic win was Zohran Mamdani’shistory-making victoryin America’s most populous city, New York, but there was success too at the other end of the continent, as voters in California backed Democrats on anapparently technical measurethat could prove hugely significant. In between, Democrats won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia by healthy, double-digit margins.All this has displeased Trump, but it is the election of Mamdani in Trump’s home city that brought the swiftest response. The forces of Maga have wasted no time in making the man Trump calls a“100% communist lunatic”the face of the Democratic party. The New York Post went early, with a front pageshowing the new mayorclutching a hammer and sickle, next to the headline “The Red Apple”, with the R reversed to looks suspiciously Soviet. Fox Business also broke out the Bolshevik graphics for asegment on the global threat posed by socialism, featuring international testimony on the failures that ensue when profit is not paramount – including reports on Britain’s own “broken” National Health Service.The Republican goal is clear enough: to ensure that next year’s nationwide midterm elections – where control of the House of Representatives is on the line – can be fought against a Democratic party recast as Mamdani Marxists. Right now, Democrats are confident they can see off that danger, uniting behind a common message of “affordability”, even as they tailor it to different audiences in different places – much as they did this week, with the victors in Virginia and New Jersey pressing the same cost of living themes as Mamdani but in moderate, suburban colours. That approach could work next year, when the battle for the House amounts to 435 separate elections. Come thepresidential election of 2028, however, when Democrats will have to forge a single, national message behind a single, national candidate who can appeal to both cities and suburbs, it will be harder.View image in fullscreenDemocrat Mary Sheffield, who became the first woman elected mayor of Detroit, speaks during an election night watch party in the city, 4 November 2025.Photograph: Paul Sancya/APStill, that is the kind of challenge politicians are used to tackling. A darker menace looms, and not only in Trump’s heavy hints that he couldcut off federal funding to New York. Recall that the president has already broken all precedent by sending US troops into Washington DC and Los Angeles and by attempting to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, supposedly to crack down on rampant crime but, in fact, to assert control over politically disobedient centres of power. No wonder many New York observers suspect it is only a matter of time before Trump dispatches the National Guard to Brooklyn and the Bronx, now that Gotham is in the hands of a sworn foe. Trump always wanted to conquer New York City; now he might just do it.Such a move would be of a piece with the series of actions Trump seems set to take – or is already taking – to ensure the elections of November 2026 are not allowed to go the way they did this week. Put simply, next year’s contests matter too much for him to let that happen. As of now, Trump has total control of all three branches of the US government: the White House, obviously, but also the supreme court and both houses of Congress, thanks to pliant judges in the former and Republican majorities in the latter. The Senate is unlikely to shift, but given the currently tiny Republican majority in the lower chamber, and the usual midterm swing against an incumbent party, every conventional sign would point to a Democratic takeover of the House in 12 months. If that happens, the rubber stamp will be replaced by a genuine check on the president’s power, one that – especially worrying for him – would have the authority to investigate and hold to account both Trump and those who serve him.He is determined to avert that outcome. That’s why he leaned on Republicans in Texas, demanding they redraw congressional boundaries to eke out five more safe Republican seats. It was to offset that earlier Texas move that California Democrats asked voters this week for the power to do some redistricting of their own, to give their party up to an extra five Democratic seats in the House.Californians said yes, even those who fear this tit-for-tat gerrymandering represents a race to the bottom that can only weaken US democracy.But Trump is not done. He has pushed Republicans in North Carolina, Ohio, Missouri and Indiana to follow Texas’s lead, hoping to squeeze out enough extra seats so that his party keeps the House even if voters desert them next November. Others are bracing for a supreme court decision that could weaken a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, one that currently permits state legislatures to consider race when deciding congressional boundaries. That measure has allowed for the crafting of districts that ensure that voters from minorities see their favoured candidates elected. If the court outlaws that practice, Republican-controlled state legislatures could move toeliminate those districts altogether, depriving Democrats of around a dozen seats in the south.Those are only the most visible threats. In an essay in The Atlantic, David A Grahamcharts the myriad waysin which Trump and his allies are already working to subvert the midterm elections. Some of it is old-fashioned voter suppression – making the casting of a ballot harder by, say, reducing the availability of early and postal voting or demanding specific forms of ID – while some of it is intimidation.In the elections just gone, the Trump-controlled department of justice sent “monitors” to watch over polling places in Democratic-leaning areas. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents aresnatching even US citizens off the streets, you can see how the presence of Trump-loyal “monitors” might have a chilling effect, persuading some voters that they’d be safer staying home. The presence of troops in battle fatigues on the streets, which a year from now will come to seem normal in several US cities, will have the same effect – only more so.All of this comes as Trump has gutted the agency charged withkeeping elections secure, slashed funding for theprotectionof voting from cyber-attack and looked on as many diligent election officials, including traditional Republicans, have been driven out of office and replaced by Maga activists.Even if the 2026 elections go ahead unhindered, the danger does not end there. Graham warns that Trump could declare a state of emergency, seizing voting machines before a tally is made official. A defeated Republican House speaker could refuse to seat victorious Democrats (as, in fact,Speaker Mike Johnson is already doing). And, through it all, there would be loud voices on Fox News, on social media and perhaps even on some of the mainstream networks that have recentlybent the knee to Trump, defending if not applauding his every move.This week’s results suggest that, if it’s a fair fight, Democrats can win a year from now, finally putting a brake on Trump’s march towards autocracy. But that’s a big if – and with each passing day, it’s only getting bigger.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist and host of thePolitics Weekly America podcastGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?

At first glance it could be mistaken as evidence of his hands-on approach at Coventry training, collateral damage from partaking in those snappy rondos. The reality is a world away from frontline coaching. “I twisted it playing with the kids in Hyde Park on a Sunday,” he says, breaking into a broad smile.It is Lampard down to a T. As a youngster he was ticked off by his late mother, Patricia, for wearing football boots to bed and once spent a weekend in Bournemouth at his uncle Harry Redknapp’s housebreaking in a pair of moulds. Lampard has always been immersed in the game, from joining Heath Park boys’ club and fulfilling his dream of pulling on a West Ham shirt to cementing his place as one of England’s greatest midfielders across 13 years and countless trophies at Chelsea. Those days have gone – Coventry represents his fourth club as a manager – but the 47-year-old still believes in being in the thick of things.“The people I aspired to be when I started to do this and went to watch different managers, the best ones were right in the middle of the training pitch, trying to get their message across there and then,” he says. “I went to watch Pep [Guardiola] for a few days because of my Man City connections, Eddie Howe, Thomas Frank. For me, the good ones, generally, are in the middle of everything. I think that’s the best way so I am active like that and I enjoy being that way. That’s how I’d want to be coached in this modern day. It’s good to interact with the players.”Joe Cole: ‘Anything which generates the money you get in football means the parasites come’Read moreLampard is engaging company, touching on everything from Coventry’s pacesetting start asChampionshipleaders to the evolution of Thomas Tuchel’s England and even Midsomer Murders. He is talking in a hospitality box overlooking the CBS Arena pitch, fresh from meeting participants from a dementia programme run by the club’s charity arm. It is one of the community projects across the English Football League’s 72 clubs that collectively engage with more than one million people a year and among those showcased across the afternoon at the ground to celebrate the EFL’s annual week of action. Coventry’s initiative resonates with Lampard whose grandmother Hilda was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease when he was a teenager.Quick GuideChampionship: Watford 1-1 Bristol CityShowRobins hit back to draw at WatfordGerhard Struber praised quick-thinking Scott Twine after his free-kick earned Bristol City a 1-1 draw at Watford in the Championship.Twine caught out home goalkeeper Egil Selvik in the 29th minute with a set piece from the edge of the box on the left that beat the Norwegian at his near post.That impressed the City manager Struber, as did Twine’s overall contribution.“Scott [has] outstanding technical power with his monster leg,” he said.“It helped us to score in this way but I like his energy at the moment – his work ethic on the field to invest everything.“You do not see it that often that players on this level work really hard against the ball but this was the key - players with high technical level were involved in our defensive pressing moments.”Marc Bola’s first Watford goal gave the Hornets a sixth-minute lead, with captain Imran Louza setting him up with a 70-yard pass from his own half.That allowed Bola to sprint in behind the City defence, control the ball with an impressive first touch and slot past the Robins goalkeeper Radek Vitek.The Watford manager Javi Gracia said: “The pass was sensational, the control and finalising was very good - it was a very good goal.”The point prevented City, who were without a number of players because of injury, from losing three times in six days following defeats against Stoke and Blackburn.“It was a really big point,” Struber added. “In our situation with all the players who are not available, the boys were outstanding together. The bounce back was on a really good level.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“As these things are, it was very quick. I would see lots of Nanny Hilda and she would always have the tea made, the cakes and sandwiches ready. She lived in east London, not far from Upton Park, and when you’re that bit younger you don’t recognise all the signs, but it started with some memory loss and it became much more severe. It was quite scary as a family to deal with. But many, many families are coping with it and we have to help as much as we can. The positive faces I saw a moment ago show how much we can do to support.”Coventry are the highest scorers in the top four tiers of English football; remarkably, their tally of 39 goals, courtesy of 10 scorers, has exceeded their total for the 2016-17 season, when the club were relegated to League Two, and is at least double the number mustered by all but four of their division rivals. After a couple of near misses, there is renewed optimism about returning to the Premier League for the first time since relegation in 2001. AfterTuesday’s win against Sheffield United, Coventry have more points after 14 matches than four of the six automatically promoted teams had at the same stage in the past three campaigns, including Leeds and Burnley last season.This Saturday brings a trip to second-placed Stoke, managed by Mark Robins, Lampard’s predecessor who dragged the club from League Two to within touching distance of the Premier League. It is a quirky timing; Friday marks a year since Robins was sacked with the club 17th, outside the relegation zone on goal difference. This month marks Lampard’s first anniversary in charge and he, too, went close to guiding Coventry to the top flight last season, losing to Sunderland in the playoff semi-finals. On his first day he gathered the staff into the gym, including chefs and cleaners, and told the players they were better than the table suggested. Lampard has revitalised the place.View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard puts an arm around Haji Wright, one of Coventry’s 10 goalscorers this season.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWhat is the most discernible difference between the team now and the one he inherited? “Well, the team now starts to feel like a team that I want my team to look like … that’s absolutely no disrespect to what went on before because the [previous] manager had the most incredible success. But when I came in you could feel the confidence was down, when you looked at the team I don’t think there was a clear identity and that can happen without confidence. I’ve lost my job as well, so I understand what can happen. My job was to go: ‘Where can we get better?’ We have tried to create a team with real speed and energy. We want to be a very positive team in how we win the ball back and attack. At the moment I see a lot of things I like and hopefully the fans are enjoying it.”At his unveiling Lampard was peppered with questions about why he wants to work in such a volatile industry, rather than be a pundit or practise his golf swing. “I take slight offence to that line of questioning – ‘why do you do this?’ – because I’m presuming money’s involved. I am quite driven so I do want to prove everybody wrong all the time, I think it’s a good driving force. I try not to rely on it because if you do you’ll be the best manager one week, the worst manager the next week. That’s pretty much the story.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has felt scrutiny throughout his career, from the infamous moment when Redknapp defended selecting his nephew at a West Ham fans’ forum in 1996. Lampard won 106 caps, representing England at four major tournaments, including three World Cups, when the narrative was often that anything but victory was failure. “‘The golden generation should absolutely have won a tournament’ … well, no, we had to go against Spain, France and Germany and it wasn’t easy. And it won’t be next summer. At the same time I can imagine the work is very good, we have got good talent in the squad; it’s exciting and I hope they do very well.” Has he tired of the talk of the so-called golden generation? “Yeah, a little bit. It’s old news and people sensationalise it. I look back very fondly on my England career but we didn’t win and that’s a fact.”So, what has Lampard made of England under Tuchel, who has been happy to leave out big names? “You can see the direction he wants to take them, where there is a real togetherness about the team, the style, and I think it’s been positive. My generation gets spoken about a lot but it was a different time, era and group. With my group at Coventry, the most important thing for us is that we’re all together and the players professionally get on well and they know the direction we’re going and they all respect each other.”Balance emerges as a theme. He commutes from the family home in London and Redknapp is usually first to call after matches, catching Lampard on the M40. Other times he turns to music or podcasts to wile away the journey. He added The Enemy – the Coventry band who before Tuesday’s win performed We’ll Live and Die in These Towns, a song adopted as the club’s pre-match anthem – to his playlist and in the summer saw Oasis three times at Wembley. “I remember their [first] albums coming out, I was 17, 18, and I was very ready for that at the time,” he says, smiling. “It was a sweet spot for my era.”View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard with participants at the EFL’s annual week of action event.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockDoes he tend to steer clear of sport when it comes to podcasts? “I listened toSteven Bartlett with Jürgen Kloppthe other day and that was very interesting. But, yeah, generally I like to go away from it. I like politics or crime. Murder mysteries. I listen to Dateline. I’ve got that kind of weird fascination with these things: how do these things get solved?”Overworking can be glamorised and Lampard confesses he is a “workaholic” but recognises the value of time with his seven-year-old daughter, Patricia, and four-year-old son, Freddie. “It just gives me a bit of a softener,” he says. “I have four children: my eldest daughters are at university, one in Scotland, one in London, and my younger ones keep me busy, so I enjoy being at home with them and my wife. That’s what I love doing. If I get a day off, I’m very, very happy to be doing the basics of life, that’s the perfect switch-off.”Explore more on these topicsFrank LampardCoventry CityChampionshipinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Here, experts reveal 15 ways to make sure your furry friends are at their bestSarah PhillipsFri 7 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 12.02 ESTShareHalf of UK adults own a pet, with 28% opting for a dog and 24% a cat,according to vet charity PDSA. How can we ensure these animals are in good health? From feeding to fireworks, vets share their advice on how to keep our canine and feline friends healthy and happy.Do your researchRory Cowlamis a vet forPickles in Fulham, London. He advises educating yourself before introducing a dog or cat into your home: “I would 100% recommend reading some books and looking online. There are so many good resources out there. Make sure you are getting the information from a reputable source: speak to vets, trainers, friends who have had pets, and build your knowledge base that way.”Where you get your pet from matters too, says Cowlam. “The best thing to do is adopt from a charity. But if you’re going to a breeder, go on personal recommendations, or check for approved breeders – make sure to do your homework and at the first sign of something not quite right, move on.”Feed them well …View image in fullscreenDinner time …Photograph: Cris Cantón/Getty Images“You don’t need the most premium thing on the market – just make sure you’re feeding them a good diet,” says Cowlam. He suggests looking at the ingredients on the back of pet-food packets and taking the contents as seriously as you might for yourself.Jo Lewis, a feline vet from Berkshire and author ofWhat’s My Cat Thinking?says: “It is really important that people look at the label to see, is it ‘complete and balanced’? If it says ‘complementary’, it has not got all the right vitamins and minerals. If you just feed them that, they could end up with deficiencies.”… But not too much“There arestudies to show that it can take two years off dogs’ livesif they are overweight,” says vetCat Henstridge, who runs a practice in Dronfield near Sheffield. “For both species, it impacts negatively on their health: it predisposes cats to diabetes, it can complicate things such as heart disease. Dogs are born to run around, and if they are too big, this can be more difficult. So keep them slim. That is not always that easy, because they love to eat, we love to feed them, and it can be very hard to know whether they are too big or not. If you are ever worried, ask your vet: the doors are always open, the scales are always on.”Lewis says puzzle feeders can “slow their eating down, but more importantly, it gives them something to do. It makes food not just inhaling biscuits from a bowl, it makes it an activity.”View image in fullscreenTreats can be key for training.Photograph: Tony Anderson/Getty ImagesGo easy on the treatsTreating your pet is a joy, but they should be given in moderation, says Cowlam. One of the traps people fall into is they give their dog treats that fill them up, then they don’t eat their dinner.” But treats can be key for training, Henstridge acknowledges: “They are a really good training tool if you’ve got a food-oriented animal. But it is easy to overfeed them because they don’t tell us when they’ve had enough. It is about making sure you know what your pet’s daily calories are, and then making sure you balance that out with meals and their treats.” You can also use other things to train and distract, such as toys and attention, she says.Be cautious with fresh foodIncluding a bit of fresh food into their diet is OK, says Cowlam, but as a rough rule 50% should be a complete, balanced dog or cat food. On top of this, “you want to be adding things that are going to be beneficial, like vegetables or plain, lean protein.”Cowlam adds: “If you are going to make your own [pet] food, in a word, don’t, because you won’t manage to balance it. You won’t manage to make it appropriate for them, it won’t be complete, and you run the risk of nutritional deficiencies.”Know what foods are toxic“There is a bit of crossover between cats and dogs on the toxin side,” says Cowlam. “Both of them are a big no on grapes, raisins and chocolate. Onions, leeks and garlic are worse for cats than dogs, but still quite bad for both, and dose dependent. And xylitol, a sweetener in things like confectionery and peanut butter – do keep an eye out for it.” He says that Christmas and Easter are big times for poison-related vet visits because “raisins are everywhere”.Clean their teethView image in fullscreenA brushing routine should be established as early as possible.Photograph: Oscar Wong/Getty Images“Dental health is often cited by vets as one of the top welfare concerns in pets, and we are very good at turning a blind eye to that,” says Cowlam. “It is very rare that I see an animal get to double figures without needing some sort of dentistry.” It is integral to establish a brushing routine from day one, the vets agree, to get the animal used to doing it as early as possible.“You can teach an old dog new tricks, and even cats can be persuaded,” says Henstridge, “but it isn’t easy, and it is a real skill as well, to handle a brush and a dog and some toothpaste.” Finger brushes can work better, “because then you’re not coming at their face with a stick. The problem is, by the time you’re noticing bad breath, the teeth may well be painful, so the reason they don’t want you to do it is because it is sore”. It is worth getting “a proper dental assessment at a vet, having the dental work they recommend, then starting from a clean slate,” says Henstridge. If you can’t persuade pets to have their teeth brushed, there are products, such as teeth biscuits, chews or powders, she says: “but just do something”.Ensure exercise is part of their routineView image in fullscreenFetch!Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/Alamy“Most dogs would benefit from an hour of exercise a day, but what is more important is what the exercise is,” says Henstridge. “If a dog can get off the lead, then they can do their own thing: potter, sniff and gallop a bit.”Dogssee the world through their noses, which gives them a lot of mental stimulation. “We want to physically tire them out so they can sleep, but we also want to mentally tire them out so when they get home they are in the frame of mind to rest, rather than parkour off the sofa.”“Exercise is probably more of a problem in cats,” says Cowlam, “because cats are inherently sedentary, particularly indoor cats.” Allocating play time with them, like you would walking for a dog, is essential, he says. “If you can safely give cats access to outdoor space, then that is the goal,” says Lewis. “But the reality is, a lot of cats have never been outside. That means we have to provide everything they would be getting from an outdoor life as much as we can inside.” Cat trees, multilayered structures and shelves with grip on them can provide this.Ditch the ball flingerHenstridge has an impassioned plea for dog owners: “If you have a ball flinger, throw it in the bin and never use it. They are the worst because the dogs go super far, really fast. They jump and leap for the balls. The balls bounce up and down, and then they turn on a sixpence and hare back. It is really intense exercise on their joints, which over time can be incredibly damaging. Some dogs developaddict-type behaviour towards balls, because of the adrenaline rush they get when they’re doing this, and that is no good for their mental health.”Some pets don’t like to be left alone“You need a degree of separation from your pet from day one,” says Cowlam, otherwise “you’ll end up with a dog that needs to be in sight of you at all times.” When leaving them, start small from 10 minutes and build up. Four hours is the maximum that theRSPCA recommendsleaving a dog for. “I probably wouldn’t want to do that too frequently,” says Cowlam. “I can probably count on one hand how many times I’ve left my dog for four hours, and she is five.”If they’re scared of bangs try drum’n’bassIt is the season for banging fireworks that can frighten pets. “The main species that struggles is dogs,” says Henstridge. “That’s not to say that cats don’t, but they are less demonstrative about their fear. If your cat goes and hides, leave them to it.” She advises locking any cat flaps, though, as they can get disoriented by the noise and go missing if they go out.With dogs, Henstridge advises to “give them a good run around on the days when you know there will be fireworks. Tire them out, feed them their tea early – because a tired, full dog is a sleepy dog. Give them a toy to distract them: chewing and licking is an anxiety-dumping behaviour for dogs. Shut the curtains, turn on the telly: dogs have very sensitive hearing, so they will probably still hear the bangs, but drowning out the night with something else is really helpful. The best way to do that, if they are very sensitive, is actually drum’n’bass music, because of the rhythm, and the bangs in the music.”Care for their hairView image in fullscreenA cat being groomed.Photograph: Juniors Bildarchiv GmbH/Alamy“Nobody wants to bath a dog unless they absolutely have to,” says Henstridge. Luckily, “you shouldn’t need to regularly unless they have a skin problem. Some sensitive dogs with allergies benefit from regular medicated baths, but the average dog does not. It is very dependent on when they roll in something disgusting, possibly more frequently for the fluffy ones.”With cats, “if they are fit, well and they are shorthaired, they probably don’t need to be brushed,” says Lewis, “however, like tooth brushing, you don’t want to wait until there’s a problem and then try to start to teach them how to tolerate being groomed”. Lewis suggests using, “silicone hand-shaped brushes that are like a massage tool that feels nice, not tugging or sharp and bristly. That can be a great way of enriching time with your cat.” Remember to remove any loosened hair with damp hands or rubber gloves to avoid hairballs, says Lewis.Keep a basic animal first aid kitView image in fullscreenMinor ailments can often be treated at home.Photograph: Tierfotoagentur/AlamyTry to gauge the severity of an injury before contacting your vet, says Cowlam: “There are some things you can give a little bit of time, like cuts and scrapes. If it’s not that deep, keep it clean, cover it, don’t let them lick it. Having a first aid kit at home is really sensible, with pet-safe antiseptic spray for cuts, scrapes or torn nails, and some sort of bandaging material. With limping, “as long as the pet seems OK, is eating and drinking well, give it 24 hours or so, because a lot of these problems will settle with a bit of rest and recuperation. There are a lot of really good services out there that provide veterinary care over apps and text, if you are more of a worried owner and you want that level of communication without coming into the vet.”If you are ever in doubt, seek help, says Henstridge: “Our animals are really good at hiding things and coping with illness and pain – they won’t necessarily limp, cry or squeal, they will just slow down a bit.”Have regular checkups“Have a relationship with your local vets,” says Henstridge. “Take pets for their annual vaccines, regular checkups, because having that professional assessment of their health is so valuable.”How often should you visit? “If you’ve got a generally healthy pet, once a year is fine for a health check,” says Cowlam. Go armed with a list of questions: “I love it when people come with a list, because it gives me some structure to work on while I’m examining the pet.”“If the cat is going outside, then it will have the potential to be exposed to all sorts of ticks, fleas and worms,” says Lewis. “I would always suggest people talk to their vets about their cat and their own individual lifestyle to get a proper risk assessment as to what products and what frequency they need to be applied.”Give them loveView image in fullscreen‘Cats definitely need the right sort of attention.’Photograph: Dmitry Marchenko/Alamy“You’ve got to think of pets as zoo animals,” says Lewis. As their owner, your job is to “enrich their life and take responsibility for what they are lacking.” That said, not all cats want to be stroked, Lewis points out: “Cats definitely need lots of the right sort of attention, but the caveat is that it should always be on the cat’s terms.” It is surprisingly overlooked, but above all, “love and attention is really important,” says Cowlam. “That is not only the best thing about having a pet, but it is also really important for them, so make sure you’ve got plenty of time to give them.”Explore more on these topicsPetsThe expertsAnimalsCatsDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Defeatism never took a single of a fraction of a degree of global warming. It never created a single job. It never did anything.”Miliband spoke as world leaders have been meeting in Belém, Brazil, before thecrucial Cop30 conferencebegins on Monday, at which governments of every stripe will attempt to forge a pathway that limits global temperatures and avoids the ravages of climate breakdown.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, struck a note of desperationwhen he warned this weekthat efforts to limit heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels – the goal of the Paris climate agreement, and the last safe point, according to scientists – had failed.“We’ve got to be the bearers of hope,” Miliband said. “We can fight back. Climate is a strength [in the battle against hard-right populism] not a weakness. We’re about giving a better future for people’s kids and grandkids.”He warned that populists wanted people to slip into gloom and defeatism over the prospects of climate breakdown. Progressives must make the climate their core rallying cry, as most people around the world want climate action, he said.Miliband’s words also seemed aimed at some within his own party, who have sought in backroom briefings to play down the UK’s climate policies for fear of having them targeted by Reform UK. Some aides to Keir Starmer, the prime minister,sought to prevent him from going to Cop30.View image in fullscreenEd Miliband and Keir Starmer, left, attend Prince William’s Earthshot prize award ceremony in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday.Photograph: Bruna Prado/AP“People who want to shrink back from this argument and want to somehow soft pedal on this argument are just plain wrong. Nobody ever won an argument by soft pedalling or not making the argument,” Miliband told the Guardian.“Our agenda is a hopeful agenda. The agenda of our opponents is the agenda of despair, that nothing can be done and we’ve just got to accept the inevitable of climate breakdown.”He said the world should not give up on limiting global heating to the crucial 1.5C threshold, as we could be on the verge of a rapid global shift to clean energy that will defy predictions of doom.“I’m notgiving up on 1.5C,” said Miliband. “I think actually we’re seeing somepositive tipping points[that will trigger a rapid move to a low-carbon economy]. You’re seeing an absolute transformation in different parts of the world around solar power.”Renewable energy now attractsdouble the global investment– more than $2tn – of fossil fuels, and large emitters of carbon such asChinaandIndiaare moving rapidly to low-carbon energy in place of coal.Downplaying the issue of climate breakdown would not work in the battle for voters by progressive parties against populists, in Miliband’s view. Rightwing parties were winning elections and topping polls because “people are deeply unhappy with the status quo”, he said. “And they’re not wrong.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Mine is an ex-mining constituency. People don’t ask to bring back the coalmines. People ask for the good jobs of the future, and that’s what we’ve got to do.”In Belém, the pre-conference world leaders’ summit on Friday saw pleas for action from some of the world’s most vulnerable countries. Somalia’s deputy prime minister, Salah Ahmed Jama, made a powerful speech, saying his country was responsible for only 0.01% of greenhouse gas emissions, but was among the four nations most affected by drought, floods and other extreme weather disasters.“For us, climate crisis is a reality. It is the mother who has to walk 10km to get water. It is the pastoralist who is losing his herds. It is the children who end up in a camp suffering hunger and disease.” He urged world leaders to find funds to support vulnerable nations, saying climate finance was their main hope now that governments were cutting overseas development aid.Kenya’s deputy president, Kithure Kindiki, said: “Extreme drought alternating with floods continues to threaten livelihoods and wipe out the gains of our development agenda. As I am here, scores of people are being searched for after being buried under a landslide. Such incidents have become common.”View image in fullscreenKenya’s deputy president, Kithure Kindiki, second from left, gathers with other world leaders before Cop30.Photograph: António Lacerda/EPAHe said the lack of climate finance was an insult and an injustice to those suffering from the climate crisis. He also pointed out the positive story of the green energy revolution in Africa, noting that Kenya already gets 93% of its electricity from clean energy and was a vital source of critical minerals needed for wind turbines, solar panels and batteries. “We can help the world in its transition to clean energy,” he said.Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the president of host nation Brazil, said: “It took 28 climate Cops for us to commit, in Dubai, to a just, orderly and equitable energy transition. The Earth can no longer sustain the development model based on the intensive use of fossil fuels that has prevailed for the last 200 years.”Although Lula leads a country that is among the top 10 oil and gas producers in the world, the president was sending a clear signal to his negotiators to keep the fossil fuel phaseout question alive at this conference, despite efforts by Saudi Arabia in pre-Cop talks to block it.The pithiest reminder of the need for collective action came from Zimbabwe’s environment minister, Evelyn Ndlovu, who said: “The climate crisis is not a competition. There is no winner or loser. Either we all win or we all lose.”TheCop30 negotiations will carry onfor two weeks, discussing how to “transition away from fossil fuels”, protect global forests and raise the money needed to rescue poor countries from catastrophe. Key to success for the meeting will be plotting a future course towards holding down global temperatures as far as possible. Current national plans on emissions cuts from big countries would lead to temperature rises of 2.5C above preindustrial levels, which would spell devastation and extreme weather around the world.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentEd MilibandCop30Green politicsRenewable energyEnergyFossil fuelsnewsShareReuse this content"

Maskell, the York Central MP, and Duncan-Jordan, who represents Poole, had spearheaded opposition to the cut to the winter fuel allowance and welfare reforms.Hinchliff, the MP for North East Hertfordshire, organised a rebellion over the government’s flagship planning bill, voicing concerns about its effect on nature. Of the suspended MPs, all but Maskell are from the 2024Labourintake.At the same time, party whips removed trade envoy roles from three other MPs who rebelled – Rosena Allin-Khan, Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Mohammad Yasin.In response to having the whip restored, Hinchliff said: “I’m pleased to have returned to the parliamentary Labour party and welcome the constructive discussions I’ve had with the new chief whip in recent months.“As ever, my focus remains on serving the communities of North East Hertfordshire and contributing to Labour’s historic mission to create a society that puts people and nature before profit.”Duncan-Jordan told the PA news agency: “I’ve been part of the Labour and trade union movement for 40 years, so I’m pleased to have had the Labour whip restored today.“I’ll continue working hard for my constituents in Poole and standing up for Labour values – tackling poverty, raising living standards and building a fairer society.”Maskell said she was “Labour to the core and will always stand up for Labour values”, after having the party whip restored.The MP told the PA news agency: “I will continue to work hard for my constituents in York as their Labour and Co-operative MP.”In 2024, shortly after the general election, seven other Labour MPs lost the whip for supporting an amendment to the king’s speech calling for an end to the two-child benefit cap, which has been blamed for a rise in child poverty.Four of these, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Ian Byrne, Imran Hussain and Richard Burgon,had the whip restored in January and February. Two others, John McDonnell and Apsana Begum,had it reinstatedin September.The last of the seven, Zarah Sultana, has cut ties with Labour and is attempting to launch a new leftwing party alongside Jeremy Corbyn, who was re-elected in 2024 election as an independent.Sultana is among a handful of other MPs elected last year on the Labour ticket who are still sitting as independents, including Diane Abbott.In July this year, in a separate case to that of the four other MPs, Abbott wassuspended for a second timeafter saying she did not regret her past remarks on racism, which had cost her the whip for a long period in the last parliament.Abbott had said people of colour experienced racism “all their lives”, which was different from the “prejudice” experienced by Jewish people, Irish people and Travellers. She was re-suspended for telling the BBC that her comments “were factually correct, as any fair-minded person would accept”.The other former Labour MPs sitting still as independents are Rosie Duffield,who resignedfrom the parliamentary party a few months after the election; Andrew Gwynne, whowas sackedas a minister and lost the whip after the emergence of offensive messages in a WhatsApp group he was part of; and Dan Norris, whowas suspendedafter he was arrested on suspicion of rape and child sex offences.Explore more on these topicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

JD Vance had been scheduled to attend in Trump’s place, but a person familiar with Vance’s plans who was granted anonymity to talk about his schedule said Vance would no longer travel there for the summit.“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in SouthAfrica,” Trump said on his social media site. In his post, Trump cited “abuses” of Afrikaners, including violence and death as well as confiscation of their land and farms.The Trump administration has long accused the South African government of allowing minority white Afrikaner farmers to be persecuted and attacked. As it restricted the number of refugees admitted annually to the US to 7,500, the administration indicated that most will be white South Africans who it claimed faced discrimination and violence at home.But the government of South Africa has said it is surprised by the accusations of discrimination, because white people in the country generally have a much higher standard of living than its Black residents, more than three decades after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule.The country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said he’s told Trump that information about the alleged discrimination and persecution of Afrikaners is “completely false”.Nonetheless, the administration has kept up its criticisms of the South African government. Earlier this week during an economic speech in Miami, Trump said South Africa should be thrown out of the Group of 20.Earlier this year, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, boycotted aG20meeting for foreign ministers because its agenda focused on diversity, inclusion and climate change efforts.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSouth AfricaAfricaG20newsShareReuse this content"

The BBC’s board is compiling its response.However, insiders believe the leaking of the memo to the Daily Telegraph and the criticisms that have followed from Johnson are part of a concerted attempt to undermine the organisation, which is heading into crucial talks with the government over the renewal of its charter.Johnson told the Telegraph that Davie “must either explain or resign” over the claims in the memo. He said the BBC had been “caught red-handed in multiple acts of leftwing bias”.Concerns have previously been raised about the role of Robbie Gibb, who joined the BBC board when Johnson was in Downing Street.Gibb wasTheresa May’s communications directorduring her tenure as prime minister and helped launch the rightwing news channel GB News.Sources have told the Guardian that Gibb was instrumental in the appointment of Prescott as an adviser to the EGSC. They have previously been reportedas being friends. Prescott left his BBC advisory role in the summer.Johnson said the idea there was an effort to undermine the BBC’s leadership was “complete and utter bollocks”.“I haven’t spoken to either individual [Gibb or Prescott] – or been in contact with either of them in any way – for many years,” he said.“The first I heard of Michael Prescott’s report was when I saw it on the Telegraph website. The Panorama fabrication is scandalous. Why don’t you try to establish how and why that happened rather than making up more mad lefty nonsense?”Gibb was approached for comment, but referred the Guardian to the BBC. A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC board is made up of 13 members, five of whom are appointed by government including Sir Robbie Gibb.“The editorial guidelines and standards committee is not involved in day-to-day output. It looks at editorial matters post-broadcast, including complaints.“[The editorial adviser roles] were advertised externally as part of the BBC’s open and fair competition process, and Michael Prescott was interviewed by a panel of board members who made the collective decision to appoint him.”Gibb was on the four-person panel that interviewed Prescott for the role.Prescott was also contacted for comment.In his memo, reported by the Telegraph, Prescott states: “I have never been a member of any political party and do not hold any hard and fast views on matters such as American politics or disputes in the Middle East. My views on the BBC’s treatment of the subjects covered below do not come with any political agenda.”Prescott is now preparing to appear before the Commons culture, media and sport committee soon.Rupa Huq, one of the MPs on the committee, said this kind of appearance was not normal. She tweeted that it was“highly unusual for one person panels, particularly when they are partisan figures”.A lot will now rest on the response of the BBC’s board, of which Gibb is also a member. There are some concerns among people close to the BBC that the board was set up to boost the BBC’s commercial activities, rather than to be expert on editorial issues.Some figures concerned about the criticisms of the BBC believe they are linked to attempts, dating back to Johnson’s time in charge, to pull the media to the right.Prescott’s memo has already led to criticism from senior Conservatives. The Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, said “heads should roll” at the corporation. Johnson posted on social media last week: “Is anyone at the BBC going to take responsibility – and resign?”The main criticism of Prescott’s memo focused on an edition of Panorama, broadcast a week before the US election. He accused the BBC of selectively editing a Donald Trump speech tomake it appear clearer that he encouraged the US Capitol attack.A spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.Prescott also raised concerns about BBC Arabic. He claimed that a review by the BBC journalist David Grossman had highlighted “systemic problems within BBC Arabic” that represented anti-Israel bias. He added that insufficient action had been taken after Grossman’s report.This is disputed. Minutes ofa meeting of the EGSC in March, in which the findings of Grossman’s report were discussed, state that “important structural and management changes had recently been made to the oversight of World Service operations, including BBC Arabic. In response to the report a number of additional actions had been implemented.”A BBC spokesperson said: “With regard to BBC News Arabic, where mistakes have been made or errors have occurred, we have acknowledged them at the time and taken action.“We have also previously acknowledged that certain contributors should not have been used and have improved our processes to avoid a repeat of this.”The BBC said it had already stopped featuring figures cited by Prescott as expressing antisemitic views.In 2021, the Johnson government was accused of creating a conflict of interest afterappointing Prescottto help select the next chair of Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator. He was appointed as a senior external interviewer for the role. The Johnson government had been pushing for the Ofcom job to go to Paul Dacre, the former editor of the Daily Mail.The Tube presenter, the former ballerina and the banker: the BBC board’s membersRead moreAt the time, a government spokesperson responded on Prescott’s behalf to say: “The recruitment process for the Ofcom chair is fair and open and there are no conflicts of interest. Mr Prescott’s role on the panel has been approved by the independent commissioner for public appointments.”Gibb has previously been accused of attempting toblock a senior editorial appointmenton political grounds. He was accused of trying to stop Jess Brammar, the former editor ofHuffPostUK and deputy editor of BBC Newsnight, from a role overseeing the BBC’s news channels.A BBC spokesperson said at the time that “as a general principle, board members are able to discuss issues with other board members or senior executives. These principles were adhered to”.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 97.The breakthrough – made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 – turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But near the end of his life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks, including saying Black people were less intelligent than white people.Watson shared a 1962 Nobel prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder.That realization was a breakthrough. It instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dalí and a British postage stamp.The discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether the body’s blueprint should be altered for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person’s offspring.“Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,” Watson once said. He later wrote: “There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.”Watson never made another lab finding that big. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir and helped guide the project to map the human genome. He picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.Watson died in hospice care after a brief illness, his son said on Friday. His former research lab confirmed he had died a day earlier.“He never stopped fighting for people who were suffering from disease,” Duncan Watson said of his father.Watson’s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: his son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease – maybe in time to help his son.He gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was “inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa” because “all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours – where all the testing says not really”. He said that while he hoped everyone was equal, “people who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true”.He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. “No, not at all,” he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab revoked several honorary titles it had given Watson, saying his statements were “reprehensible” and “unsupported by science”.He had shown “a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career”, Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. “His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim’s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.”It was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson – already the holder of a PhD at 23 – arrived at Britain’s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said: “It was intellectual love at first sight.”Together they sought to tackle the structure of DNA, aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in The Double Helix, and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked. She died in 1958.Watson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule’s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the “rungs” of a double helix ladder.His first reaction: “It’s so beautiful.”Following the discovery, Watson spent two years at the California Institute of Technology, then joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955. Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university’s program for molecular biology, Mark Ptashne, a scientist, recalled in a 1999 interview.Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later. He made the lab on Long Island an educational center for scientists and non-scientists, focused research on cancer, instilled a sense of excitement and raised huge amounts of money.Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928, into “a family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic party”, as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn’t rely on reason or science.He got interested in genetics at the age of 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.At the time, it wasn’t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.“Suddenly I was excited about chemistry,” Watson wrote in The Double Helix. If genes could crystallize, “they must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.“A potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,” he recalled.His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn’t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.Both of Watson’s Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004.Explore more on these topicsUS newsnewsShareReuse this content"

An investigation concluded there were “no systemic issues” – but there remain health concerns among the troops involved.One source said “people are still being hurt”. It is understood that a small number of soldiers reported noise and vibration concerns and had to be processed at a military medical centre.Luke Pollard, a junior defence minister, said on Wednesday Ajax’s noise and vibration problems were “firmly in the past” at a launch event for the armoured vehicle, which has been formally accepted into army service.“If it were not safe, we would not be putting it in the hands of our frontline troops,” Pollard said. “I’ve been reassured from the top of the army down to the folks that work on the platform that it is safe.”British military announces first delivery of Ajax armoured vehicles – eight years lateRead moreBut subsequently, when theMinistry of Defence(MoD) was asked about issues raised by soldiers, a spokesperson acknowledged there had been problems. “Where concerns were raised over the summer, these were investigated by a safety team and no systemic issues were found,” they said.The MoD would not say exactly how many were treated after noise complaints, though it said there had been no reports of tinnitus motion sickness. Care took place in a primary GP-style care facility, it added.Concerns about deafness from military service have plagued the British army for decades. In September, thousands of UK veteranslaunched a legal claimagainst 3M, saying its combat earplugs, used in Afghanistan and elsewhere, were not effective. The US manufacturer says its product worked if used properly.This week journalists toured the Ajax manufacturing site, a General Dynamics factory in Merthyr Tydfil, and were transported on the 7.6-metre-long tracked vehicle, which weighs about 40 tonnes and has a top speed of just over 40mph (65km/h).A meter on a mobile phone showed a reading of 90 decibels from a few metres away. Long or repeated exposure at sounds above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss, and employers must provide protection if that level is exceeded,according to the Health and Safety Executive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Soldiers on or in a moving Ajax could move for six hours and still be three-quarters below safety limits, defence sources said.Ajax has been delayed by years, most recently because of concerns about noise and vibration. It was first intended to be introduced in 2017, then in 2020 and 2021, but trials had to be halted in June 2021 because of safety concerns.A review, published in December 2021, revealed that 11 people out of 310 who tested Ajax had “long-term restrictions on noise exposure recommended” by a medical assessment, while 17 were under specialist outpatient care.At the time, a defence minister in the then Conservative government said the episode showed the army did not place as high a value on safetyas cost and value for money.Explore more on these topicsBritish armyMinistry of DefenceHealthMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

It also the centre of a legal dispute between Mitchells & Butlers Retail, the company that runs Toby Carvery, and Enfield council, the landowner, which was not consulted on the works to the tree, promptingoutrage from its leader.In the meantime, Toby Carvery is under pressure to help make amends by funding a scheme to try to regenerate the stump.Russell Miller, an arborist who specialises in ancient trees, says the remains of the oak could be put on a form of “life support” relatively cheaply. Such a systemhelped preserve the oldest tree in Poland, he said.Miller said the Toby Carvery oak was “alive, and it’s re-sprouting – the issue is whether those sprouts will die off, either because they just dry up or in the medium term they don’t have enough photosynthetic capability to generate enough energy to sustain the root system”.He added: “The way to influence that would be to put a sprinkler system on it that would reduce the risk of individual shoot failure and system failure. It would require a tank in the Toby Carvery car park, and sprinklers with a pump. It would only cost about £10,000 and a bit of project management.”Adam Cormack, the head of campaigning at the Woodland Trust, said: “Ancient trees like the Whitewebbs oak are irreplaceable. It’s vital every effort is made to keep what’s left alive so it can continue to help wildlife thrive and inspire and educate future generations.“We would hope Toby Carvery will do all they can to ensure this magnificent tree has the best chance of survival.”Cormack accepted that the chances of the oak’s regeneration were unclear. “This type of work is highly experimental, but we should be trying everything to secure a future for this remarkable tree,” he said.“In 200 years, we want a family to be able to walk past, point at the marks on its trunk and tell the story of when the Whitewebbs oak nearly died. We must act now to try to preserve its remains.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

But one resident near Newmarket has apparently had enough – and complained to the local council about the neighing horses.Mandy Young, a horse owner based about 10 miles from the racecourse, said she received a notice of the complaint in the post and was told it was linked to the “constant neighing” of her animals.She called it “ridiculous”, adding: “The area is super horsey. It’s the main home of horse racing … Newmarket is one of the few places where they have actual roads and crossings dedicated to the horses. There are probably more horses than there are people in Newmarket.”Young, who has 15 horses at her home, said five of the seven properties nearby also kept horses. “I think there’s about 25 horses in about a half-mile radius.”She said the complaint dated to the end of last month and was most likely related to a period when she was weaning foals. According to the international charity World Horse Welfare, the process can be stressful for horses and cause them to call out to one another.“They did call a bit but it definitely wasn’t constant. It was just a bit more than it would usually be, and it is over now,” Young said. “They did do a little bit of calling last night … They’ll call backwards and forwards to each other for a few minutes and then they stop. So that’s what I assume it is from.”She said the complaint could have been triggered by her using a different field to wean the animals than previously – speculating that people living near the new field may not be used to having horses nearby.Nevertheless, she said, horses were not considered among the noisiest of animals. “Cattle are noisy… One of my friends said: ‘They should be here. I’ve got cattle next door.’ When they’re weaning the calves, they make an awful lot of noise.“The thing is, I don’t just cold-turkey wean them. I separate them during the day for a good few weeks before I take them apart. So they are actually used to not being with their mums sometimes. It’s not such a shock to them, so they don’t make as much noise.”In any case, Young said: “Moving to Newmarket and then complaining about horse noise is like moving next to a railway track and then complaining about the train.“I was just more shocked than anything that somebody would just report me to the council, rather than come and say: ‘A. Your horses are being very noisy, are they all right?’ Or ‘B. Your horses are being very noisy – can you do something about it?’ But they didn’t.”WestSuffolkcouncil, which sent Young the notice, said the letter explained that, having received a complaint, it was legally required to act and was therefore informing her “at an early stage”.A spokesperson said: “We haven’t substantiated the complaint – the letter also says: ‘If you do not consider you are making any unreasonable noise you need take no further action.’“If the alleged noise disturbance continues, we will require the person who made the complaint to provide further details of how and when they are disturbed before we can make further inquiries and gather evidence.”The spokesperson added that they could not confirm whether an investigation would take place unless the complainant provided further information.Explore more on these topicsSuffolkHorsesHorse racingAnimal welfareAnimalsLocal governmentnewsShareReuse this content"

She told of online abuse and death threats she had received from anonymous people. She painted herself as the victim.While she sat in her home in southern Poland and publicly apologised to the McCanns for any hurt she might have caused them, Wandelt was privately waging an enormous secret campaign of harassment with no regard whatsoever for the damage she was doing to a family who had already suffered so much.By the time the podcast aired, Wandelt had bombarded the McCanns with hundreds of calls, messages and letters signed “Madeleine x”, and had even ambushed Kate and Gerry McCann at their home in December. She was still doing it. And she was plotting more.What she did not know was that the police were watching her every move. ByFebruary she was in handcuffs, charged with stalking the missing girl’s family. She had been arrested on arrival at Bristol airport with her alleged co-conspirator, Karen Spragg, from Cardiff.View image in fullscreenKaren Spragg, 61, from Cardiff, arriving at Leicester crown court on 4 November.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PASpragg, a petite 61-year-old who had become one of Wandelt’s disciples, found herself months later standing beside her friend in the dock at Leicester crown court facing one count of stalking causing serious alarm or distress.At a typical alleged stalking and harassment case there would usually be a family member or two in the public gallery but the court had needed to prepare for a potential crowd.In the first days of what would go on to be a month-long trial, about a dozen people turned out to support Wandelt and Spragg.The high court judge Mrs Justice Cutts warned everybody in court that contempt was a serious matter. Any disruptions would mean serious repercussions, including potentially finding themselves in the dock.“Julia Wandelt is not Madeleine McCann,” was one of the first things the jury was told, in definitive terms, by the prosecutor. They would later be shown proof.From the first day, proceedings had been punctuated by Wandelt’s bursts of emotion, with the defendant crying loudly, sometimes getting up from her seat and going to the back of the dock. On more than one occasion, it became necessary to take a break from the hearing for Wandelt to compose herself.The McCanns, on the other hand, were stoic and characteristically fair. Kate and Gerry, Madeleine’s parents, gave evidence from behind a screen, answering clearly and succinctly.They had tried to spare their other two children, twins Amelie and Sean, now 20, from the media attention surrounding the missing persons case, but before the trial the judge ruled it was necessary for Amelie to give evidence.View image in fullscreenMadeleine McCann disappeared from the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz in 2007 at the age of three.Photograph: PAWandelt had sent Madeleine’s sister numerous social media messages, including doctored photographs showing Wandelt and Amelie as children, and a “creepy” written letter in which Wandelt claimed to remember playing together. It was “disturbing” and “quite scary”, Amelie told the court.The McCanns believed Wandelt might be mentally unwell. In her evidence, amid the suffering caused by the defendants’ unrelenting behaviour, Kate, who works as a GP, said: “I did feel concerned and a bit guilty. I always thought Julia’s behaviour indicated she might have a mental health problem.”While Kate spoke about Wandelt and Spragg turning up at her home on 7 December last year, emerging from the darkness behind her as she got out of her car, she was measured.“I got a fright and when I realised who it was I felt quite distressed. I think I’d been on edge anyway with all the communication and it just bubbled up,” she said.Wandelt and Spragg had been demanding Kate take a DNA test and Spragg had shouted: “Don’t you want to find your daughter?”The jury was played audio recordings they made of their interactions with the McCanns, which included the family pleading with them to leave them alone, clearly telling them they were frightening and upsetting them. Gerry could be heard to say: “You are not Madeleine … I don’t want this, please do not hassle us and leave the premises.”Kate described the relief she felt when the duo were arrested, realising she no longer needed to be anxious when her phone rang. There had been one day, the jury heard, that Wandelt had called her 60 times from a withheld number.The case was definitively not about Madeleine. But Kate was forced to talk about the little girl who went missing at the age of three when the court heard how Wandelt had sent her sickening letters calling her “Mum” and had signed them “Madeleine x”.Kate said: “It’s obvious the thing I want the most … is for Madeleine to be back and for Madeleine to be calling me Mum. And that was really stressful for me. Referring to me as Mum is hard.”Wandelt did bear a passing resemblance to the childhood pictures of Madeleine, who would be expected to have similarly pale skin and dark blond hair as an adult, and Wandelt had pigmentation in her iris akin to the coloboma that became a crucial signifier in the search for the missing girl. But she was two years older than Madeleine.Ultimately though, she had “nowhere to go” when faced with scientific evidence that she had no familial link to the McCanns, the prosecutor Michael Duck KC said.Though the police knew Wandelt was not Madeleine, they reluctantly tested her DNA after her arrest, purely with the aim of ending the family’s harassment.The court heard that Wandelt and Spragg had been making ​​“increasingly bizarre plans” to collect Kate’s DNA, which included going through the McCanns’ bins and taking forks from restaurants they had eaten in.Forensic expert Rosalyn Hammond told jurors “Julia Wandelt cannot be Madeleine McCann” because their DNA profiles did not match.Wandelt appeared to have no contrition over the consequences of her actions. When it came to her evidence, she interrupted the prosecutor, often arguing back.She failed to paint herself as an innocent young woman confused about her identity who made a simple mistake.Wandelt was found guilty of harassment, but not guilty of stalking, and Spragg was found not guilty of stalking or harassment.Wandelt faces deportation after being sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, which is less than the time she has already served on remand awaiting trial. She was told she would be made the subject of a restraining order because she poses a “significant risk of the harassment of the McCanns in future”.Explore more on these topicsMadeleine McCannCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A YouGov poll this week put it just four points ahead of the Greens, which were on 16%, more than double the 6.7% share the party won at the last election.As Starmer returns from theCop30 climate summit in Brazil, his government has been divided over how loudly to champion its green agenda given concerns about rising energy bills and increasingly unified opposition on the right to net zero targets.Jones insisted Labour was not rowing back from its green promises. “I can reassure people that’s not the case,” he said, citing the government’s funding of renewables and insulation.“Let’s be honest, a few years ago, there was a global consensus around net zero. There’s not now. So it’s contested space, but Britain continues to lean into that debate.”He said that Labour had to prove to people that it was a “modern party facing the future, delivering for modern Britain” to win back progressive voters, a shift in its previous strategy of pitching to the right to prevent them going to Reform.He said he understood how younger Britons, in particular, might feel the economic system was not delivering for them, but that they would be “disappointed” by the failure of populist parties including the Greens – whom he beat into second place in his Bristol North West seat.“[The Greens] are a credible player now in the five-party system that we have right now, based on polling,” he said.“It’s their responsibility to explain to people how they would actually choose what to do if they were in government, as opposed to just promising things that are undeliverable.“My criticism of them, much like with Reform, is that they’re offering simple solutions to complex problems and that’s failing people. They’re a bit like the populist left version of the populist right.“We have to make the case for being a new, modern party of the future, and not just part of the old status quo. What I don’t want is young people, in particular, thinking: ‘I want something different to the current economic circumstances and therefore I’m going to vote for a party that is new.’“They will be disappointed, because they’re not going to get the change they want by voting for the populist left or the populist right.”View image in fullscreenThe Green party is polling well under new leader, Zack Polanski, seen here at a protest last month against the Rosebank oil and gas field.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockJones said Labour could not count on progressive voters coming back to them at the next election to keep out Nigel Farage, even though recent polling suggests they could vote tactically. “I don’t assume that at all. We have to work hard to win every single vote.”He argued the next election would be a fight between Labour and Reform, which presented a “very grave” decision for the country.“We’ve never been in a position where you could go down that populist right path, and we all have an obligation across centre and progressive politics to say that we don’t want that here.”He admitted that the prospect of Labour failure paving the way for a Farage-led government kept him up at night. “Yes, because we can’t allow that to happen and we won’t allow that to happen.”Before Rachel Reeves’s budget later this month, at which she ispreparing to increase income tax, the chancellor’s former No 2 defended breaking manifesto commitments if necessary.“You make manifesto commitments because they’re important. You wouldn’t make them lightly, but equally, if you’re in government, you’ve got to be frank with the public about the trade-offs in the situations that you have and take the right decisions for the country, even if that makes you unpopular,” he said.Privately, cabinet ministers have told the Guardian that they would only accept a tax rise if there was also something tangible that benefited the public.“Of course, we’d want to end up in a position where people across the country can see that we are helping with the cost of living pressures.”In his new post, Jones, who is based in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, is responsible for delivery across government. He said that Labour had to be much bolder about reforming failing public services.Starmer lays out vision for much-criticised digital ID schemeRead more“What we can’t do is continue to defend the status quowhere they’re not performing. Previous attempts to incrementally improve the current system have not proven to be good enough and so we’ve got to think much more radically.”He admitted that, over time, AI would replace some civil service jobs. “We’re working with the very old structures of the state that are not fit for the modern age and the public are losing out as a consequence of that. So yes, over time, civil service headcount will reduce.”He is jointly responsible for digital ID, with it due to be introduced for right-to-work checks – the only part of the system that will be mandatory – before the next election.At the same time, legislative and technological work will take place to prepare for a wider expansion. Much of the system will be built in-house, with external operators consulted for things such as banking levels of security.Since Starmer announced the government would bring in digital ID, public support for it has plummeted, to the alarm of ministers.“There’s been a lot of disinformation online … that says what this actually is, is surveillance. I mean, it’s just not, and we would never build a system in that way.”Jones admitted next May’s local elections, which are felt inside No 10 to be a moment of peril for Starmer, would be tough. “Governing parties don’t do well in midterm elections, that’s just a fact,” he said. But he denied it would be a make-or-break moment for Starmer.He did not deny, when asked, that he had leadership ambitions of his own. “I’ve got multiple big jobs that I’ve been in for a couple of weeks and I’m not planning on going anywhere anytime soon,” he said.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsDarren JonesGreen partyGreen politicsLabourCop30Keir StarmernewsShareReuse this content"

The risk, he wrote, was “high”.Yet by July 2024, six days before his knife rampage, Rudakubana had been discharged from mental health services after five years with a perfunctory report that concluded: “Poses risk to others – None.”The failures that left Rudakubana, then 17, able to murder three young girls – Bebe King, six, Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, and Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven – have been scrutinised by a public inquiry that concluded on Thursday. The inquiry chair, Adrian Fulford, is expected to deliver recommendations to the government by spring.After nine weeks of evidence from more than 100 witnesses, the Guardian can identify some of the key ways Rudakubana fell through the gaps with tragic results.Parental failureOver two days of astonishing testimony, Alphonse Rudakubana, the killer’s father,admitted knowingthat his son had amassed an arsenal of weapons – including knives, a bow and arrow and a sledgehammer, as well as a jerry can – and that he feared his son was planning to attack others.Yet he did not alert the police, or any other agency, because he worried his son would be taken away.Alphonse, 50, told the inquiry he was left terrified, abused and repeatedly violently attacked by his teenage son. Their relationship disintegrated to a point where Alphonse, given asylum in Britain after the Rwanda genocide, was too scared to curb his son’s troubling internet activity or stop his orders of knives.The inquiry heard how Alphonse and his wife, Laetitia Muzayire, had sought help for their son as early as April 2019, when his troubles began aged 12. But their relationship with professionals deteriorated as Rudakubana became more violent.Alphonse was likened to a “keyboard warrior” as he sent repeated “verbally aggressive” emails to schools, social workers and psychologists and routinely accepted his son’s version of events, despite mounting evidence of the danger he posed.By 2024, the family had effectively disengaged from all support as a mutual distrust deepened. They felt failed by the system, they said. At home, they allowed him to fester in dark places online for fear of triggering one of his many violent reactions.Rudakubana had not left the house for more than two years before the Southport atrocity, spending his time amassing weapons, including machetes and other knives for which his father took delivery.View image in fullscreenOne of the weapons seized by police at the home of Axel Rudakubana.Photograph: Merseyside police/PAOn 23 July 2024, seven days before he murdered the three girls, Alphonse stopped his son from taking a taxi to his former school, from where he had been permanently excluded nearly five years earlier. He was carrying a knife and asked his father to buy petrol for his jerry can.The parents admitted to the inquiry they knew by then he was planning an attack. Yet they failed to alert the police or any other agencies. This, Alphonse admitted, had “catastrophic consequences for which I am desperately sorry”.The tech companiesSix minutes before he left home for his lethal attack, Rudakubana searched X, formerly Twitter, for a video of thestabbing of Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuelat a Sydney church in April 2024. The teenager had multiple accounts on the platform yet there are no restrictions as to what under-18s can view.Giving evidence as to why such “horrific” material remained freely available on X, its head of global government affairs, Deanna Romina Khananisho, told the inquiry that removing it “isn’t justice, that’s tyrannical overreach”.Rudakubana used Amazon to buy the 20cm knife used in the attack for £8.39 two weeks earlier. His search history on the site contained axes, secateurs and bill hook knives. He went on to buy smoke grenades, a sledgehammer, castor seeds and equipment to try to make the poison ricin, some bought using false names and with a VPN to disguise his identity.Giving evidence, an Amazon executive, John Boumphrey, said the company was able to analyse suspicious purchases and report them to authorities – but that it “typically wouldn’t do that”. Rudakubana used his father’s details to pass age verification to buy the knife he used two weeks later.“It would have been, quite literally, child’s play to pass [these checks],” the inquiry counsel, Richard Boyle,said. Boumphrey accepted it had been too easy and that Amazon had “made a number of changes very swiftly”.System breakdownThe inquiry chair, Fulford, described the atrocity as a case of “wholesale failure” by multiple institutions. “Far from being an unforeseeable catastrophic event,” hesaid, Rudakubana posed a “very real and significant risk of harm” owing to his known history of knife crime.Perhaps one of the biggest questions is why in the five years the teenager was under treatment he was never seen by a forensic psychiatrist who could have properly assessed his risk.View image in fullscreenAdrian Fulford has led the inquiry at Liverpool town hall for more than two months.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAIn October 2019, aged 13, he was permanently excluded from the Range school after admitting taking in a knife on a number of occasions and planning to attack a bully. This was when PC McNamee assessed that he had “potential for huge escalation”.Three months later, he was arrested after returning to the school and seriously assaulting another pupil – not the bully, who he could not find, but an innocent student Rudakubana later said he actually liked. He had been armed with a knife and a hockey stick.Attempts to have Rudakubana assessed for autism got stuck in the NHS backlog. He was not officially diagnosed until December 2020 – a whole 77 weeks after the first GP referral and despite attempts by teachers and others to progress it more quickly.This was significant because it meant he could not have a forensic risk assessment by Alder Hey’s child and adolescent mental health services, which requires an autism diagnosis. This meant, the bereaved parents said, that violent episodes were treated as isolated incidents rather than a trajectory towards more serious harm.The inquiry was told there was sufficient evidence by September 2023, nearly a year before the attack, that Rudakubana met the conditions for an assessment under the Mental Health Act. This would have assessed his risk and possibly resulted in hospital treatment, but it never happened.There were multiple examples heard by the inquiry of a lack of information sharing between agencies. Because Rudakubana was under 18, there was no formal meeting of a multi-agency public protection arrangements team, which usually involves police, social services, probation and others discussing high-risk cases.View image in fullscreenThe victims, from left to right: Elsie Dot Stancombe, Bebe King and Alice da Silva AguiarComposite: Merseyside policeThe anti-radicalisation scheme Prevent was also scrutinised. Rudakubana was referred three times to the programme between December 2019 and April 2021 for researching potentially extremist material at Acorns pupil referral unit. Each time the cases were closed.Prevent officials told the inquiry that this was a mistake and that he would have been referred for further support had they been aware of the teenager’s wider internet history; a third referral should automatically have triggered further action.The Prevent officer who closed Rudakubana’s first two referrals said she felt other agencies were better placed to address his needs but that “there may have been a failure for information sharing”. She added: “I felt that nobody really had responsibility for him or felt that they had responsibility.”Another flaw was that frontline police officers were not able to see Rudakubana’s Prevent referrals. Had this information been shared, action may have been escalated when he was found on a bus with a knife in March 2022 saying that he wanted to stab someone and that he had an interest in making poison. Instead, police officers returned him home and advised his parents to hide their knives.Gaps in the lawThe Terrorism Act makes it a criminal offence to withhold knowledge of plans to commit an act of terror. But there is no equivalent law for when someone is preparing an attack unconnected to ideology.Rudakubana did not have a defined extremist motive – he downloaded reams of anti-Islamic material alongside antisemitic, sexist and graphically violent images – but his history of carrying knives as a weapon was well known and his father knew by early 2024 that his son was ordering weapons online. A legal duty to report this to police may have focused minds.Fulfordwill assesswhether the state should have new powers to impose restrictions on individuals when there is strong evidence they intend to carry out an attack but not enough to justify an arrest. Such a move is likely to be opposed on civil liberties grounds but the prime minister, Keir Starmer, hassaid“nothing is off the table” to prevent a repeat of 29 July 2024.After nine weeks of evidence, it is clear that many of those who had responsibility for Rudakubana must share the burden of blame. As Alice’s parents, Alex and Sergio Aguiar, said this week: “This tragedy was not inevitable. It was the result of neglect – neglect by those who should have known better and by a system that repeatedly ignored warning signs.”Explore more on these topicsSouthport attackCrimeKnife crimenewsShareReuse this content"

True, Jonathan Ross might have had all the showbiz pizazz, and Joe Marler the aggression of an unfed labrador – but when you look at the series as a whole, you have to admit thatAlan Carrwas the only deserving victor.The Celebrity Traitors final review – what an absolute blinder!Read moreThis much was evident at the heart-stopping climax of Thursday’s finale, when Carr managed to pull off a feat so brazen that it almost came off as performance art. This was a man who had spent the previous eight episodes slashing away at the contestants – gleefully murdering them behind their backs or, in two cases, as he looked them straight in the eye – and not only did he evade defeat, but he also convinced his fallen enemies to comfort him. That’s a level of skill only a true champion can achieve.View image in fullscreenNot only did he evade defeat, but he convinced his enemies to comfort him! … Alan with Nick, David and Claudia on The Celebrity Traitors final.Photograph: BBCCarr’s victory was total. Within the confines of the castle, he managed to avoid detection almost completely. This in itself is something of a miracle, given the gibbering flopsweat of his early moments as a traitor. Of the three picked in episode one, he came off like the undisputed weak link.Jonathan Ross was the garrulous veteran, who had honed his easy patter through a five-decade TV career. He was funny, unshakeable and apparently such a fan of the show that he could see several moves ahead of anyone who hunted him. Cat Burns, on the other hand, was an inscrutable unknown. She had no real persona to exploit, and by her own admission had trouble working within large groups, so she was always destined to fly under the radar.View image in fullscreenA gleeful traitor … Carr bumps off Celia – to her face.Photograph: BBCMeanwhile, the moment he was picked as a traitor, Alan Carr started twitching and hyperventilating, his eyes darting around the room like nobody’s business. At first he seemed destined to flame out like Linda from the third civilian Traitors series; a lovely woman who was so genetically incapable of keeping any form of secret that she effectively self-immolated at the earliest opportunity.But then The Celebrity Traitors did something really smart. Very early on it asked the traitors to murder a faithful in clear sight, by touching them on the face. While the other two demurred, Carr stepped up, sealing the fate of Paloma Faith for good by wiping an invisible hair off her cheek. The fact that he killed so early – and that his victim was one of his closest friends, no less – emboldened him beyond words. Before long, he took on the mantle of traitor ringleader, impatient to off as many people as he could.View image in fullscreenThe veteran, the unknown and (centre) the ringleader.Photograph: BBCViewed in the clear light of day, this is monstrous behaviour. From one angle, the story of Alan Carr is the story of a man who was given a tiny amount of power then went wild with bloodlust. It’s a pantomime retelling of theStanford Prison Experiment. But the thing that made Carr such an incredible traitor is that he managed to temper all this with an entire bucket of charm.The prevailing theory among the faithfuls this year was that of the Big Dog; in essence, that if a show has the pulling power to book people as famous as Jonathan Ross and Stephen Fry, then it would be logical to assume that they would be traitors. The Big Dog Theory did for both Ross (correctly) and Fry (incorrectly) in time, while Carr avoided scrutiny altogether. This is because very little about him is outwardly aggressive. While everyone was hunting the Big Dogs, Carr was utilising the Little Puppy Theory, and winning in spades.Who is Joe Marler? From hair-raising rugby antics to breakout star of Celebrity TraitorsRead moreBut let’s have a little perspective here. Carr didn’t win just because he was a good traitor. He also won because the faithfuls were collectively the most inept group of people ever to grace a television screen. This was a game with three traitors, and it took the faithfuls seven episodes to even find one. Statistically, they would have done a better job by writing everyone’s name on some sticky notes, then playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey.Stories will be told about exactly how useless the faithfuls were this year, about how Kate Garraway and David Olusoga evaporated all the authority they’d built up over decades in the business by pursuing the stupidest line of inquiry at every turn. These are people who failed to catch Carr, even when he failed to say the words “I am a faithful” without dissolving into nervous giggles. They are fools, one and all.So Alan Carr was always going to win The Celebrity Traitors. But he did so with such joy, such total effervescence, that he deserves to go down in history. Good luck topping that next year.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsAlan CarrTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Enter: the cocktail T-shirt.Made of wool rather than cotton, it typically features a roomy rather than a clingy cut and sleeves that hit just above the elbow. Sometimes it comes with glistening embellishment around the neckline or it is plain, giving the wearer the option to add their own level of glitz with a sparkly necklace or brooch.“They have that sort of understated look that a T-shirt tends to give the wearer, but unlike the way a cotton T-shirt sort of unravels by midday, the knit has a more polished effect,” says Buffy Reid, the founder of the British knitwear brand &Daughter. She describes the item as having “the same ease as a T-shirt but the elegance of a knit”.View image in fullscreenA slouchy cashmere T-shirt from &Daughter.Photograph: Patrick Houi/&DaughterThe cocktail T-shirt is an emerging category in evening knitwear. As a natural fibre, wool has thermodynamic properties, meaning it will keep you warm in cool weather and cool in hot conditions – a quality ideal for the festive season where one person’s central heating level is another person’s sauna.&Daughter’s evening knitwear offerings include a slouchy cashmere T-shirt made from cashmere spun in Hawick in Scotland that comes in eight colours, including – aholiday ready red,and a bestsellingpickle greenlambswool iteration with slightly voluminous sleeves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She consistently wears a simple cashmere jumper with the sleeves pushed up and a gem-set necklace for her post-show bow.This season she and her co-designer, Raf Simons, toyed with the idea of femininity and beauty on the catwalk, declaring it “is not a time for decadence” as they unveiled knitted T-shirts featuring chains and pearls dangling from the neckline, worthy of Mrs Prada’s own wardrobe.View image in fullscreenA cashmere T-shirt from John Lewis.Photograph: John LewisWhile the Prada T-shirts sell forfour figures, the high street has been quick to emulate the look, albeit using synthetic fibres or blended mixes rather than pure wool. This means they won’t biodegrade and as a non-breathable fabric could contribute to sweating. There are also concerns that high demand for cheap cashmere iscontributing to desertificationin countries including Mongolia, where the goats are farmed.Queralt Ferrer, John Lewis’s fashion director, says the elevated T-shirt trend is being driven by customers looking for value for money and versatility. Its £80 cashmere T-shirt, which can be worn to the office or to a fancy dinner, has become a bestseller.Naomi Pike, a commissioning editor at Elle UK, is a fan of the cocktail T-shirt and says it can also help reduce overconsumption. “I like to get good use out of all of my wardrobe and these help that happen when it comes to rotating skirts and not wasting precious pennies on one-hit party wears.”Pike says the cocktail T-shirt also appeals as it offers an alternative to the flesh-exposing tops typically marketed to shoppers each party season.“Cashmere, with its soft knit and stretch, fits me and my proportions better as I often find I’m in between sizes in T-shirts as my bust is big, waist small and shoulders narrow. Cashmere stretches better to accommodate these proportions that fashion often punishes,” Pike says.Explore more on these topicsFashionWomenRetail industryPradaJohn LewisnewsShareReuse this content"

But even if that were not true, this latest tale of a playdate gone unthinkably wrong would have me firmly in its grip. All Her Fault, an adaptation of bestselling thriller writer Andrea Mara’s 2021 book of the same name, braids a number of popular TV trends together, interrogating White Lotus-style the phenomenon of middle-class US affluence and the protections it offers and corruptions it encourages, a missing child narrative and an examination of the penalty women pay for motherhood. It is rare that all these things are held in balance, without at least one element becoming preachy or the thriller part becoming baggy or preposterous, but All Her Fault manages it brilliantly.We are plunged straight into the thick of things as wealthy wealth manager Marissa Irvine (Succession’s mighty Sarah Snook) arrives to pick up her five-year-old son Milo from a playdate at the home of another school mum, Jenny (Dakota Fanning). But when she reaches the supposed address, the woman who answers the door is not Jenny, has never heard of her, or Jenny’s nanny Carrie (Sophia Lillis) who was in charge of the playdate, or Milo. It soon becomes clear that no one has seen Milo since Carrie picked him up from school. He’s gone, his online tracker found smashed to bits in the school car park, and he stays gone even after the time a ransom demand would usually have been received.Why? Over the next eight extraordinarily tight episodes that nevertheless do not skimp on developing either the emotional fallout or the propulsive plot, a rich array of characters-cum-suspects arrives before us, each with a personality and backstory revealed in peeling layers. Marissa’s husband, Milo’s father, Peter (Jake Lacy, whose work in A Friend of the Family and The White Lotus is making him the go-to guy when you need an all-American hiding a multitude of secrets) is foremost among them. Yes, he takes care of his younger brother Brian (Daniel Monks), disabled in a childhood accident for which their sister Lia (The Bear’s Abby Elliott) blames herself and has the years of addiction and rehab (for which Peter uncomplainingly pays) behind and possibly ahead of her to prove. But one of the many questions All Her Fault is interested in is whether there is any such thing as a truly altruistic deed, let alone a truly good man? But how bad would you have to be to kidnap your own son?View image in fullscreenThe penalty women pay for motherhood … Sarah Snook and Duke McCloud in All Her Fault.Photograph: Sarah Enticknap/APThe Irvines’ own nanny, Ana (Kartiah Vergara) has taken some rare time off at the time of Milo’s disappearance. Is this suspicious? When she returns, she denies ever even speaking to her fellow nanny. We are shown that this is a lie. Her employers and the police must settle for it simply being implausible. Marissa’s best friend and colleague Colin (Jay Ellis) arrives to support the family. So too does Jenny, extending the hand of sorrow and friendship in a way that shocks their husbands and the police, though not as much as Marissa’s eager acceptance of it. Is this suspicious? To the women – to women generally, I suspect, and to men less so – it makes perfect sense.They briefly bonded at a dreadful school social after being pursued for voluntary stints on the PTA by its chair, the quintessential frenemy and stay-at-home-mom Sarah Larsen (Melanie Vallejo), despite the fact that they are both working people. (Sarah, whose combination of passive aggression, Machiavellian talent and sweet bitterness is much more finely drawn than usual, is one of the many extra miles run by the creators and a perfect example of the investment in detail that marks potentially formulaic dramas out from a herd of other prestigious beasts). Marissa and Jenny recognise that they are both consumed with the rage and guilt that define working motherhood (yes, yes, of a rarefied kind – Ken Loach this is not, but neither is it trying to be) when your husbands are still not quite across this idea of child-rearing as a joint endeavour. So what that Jenny feels guilt at having let Carrie into their lives (it was her responsibility to find the nanny. But her husband knows he would have done a better job of checking Carrie’s references if it had been his)? Marissa doesn’t blame her. Marissa blames herself for … everything. (Sarah blames her too. So does the media and the public, when it gets wind of the story).

And however stressful and dusty the rest of the house gets, having a clean place you can retreat to for a glass of wine in the bath is invaluable,” he says.Use the right whiteResist the urge to paint all the walls brilliant white the moment you move in, says interior designer Rebecca Constable. “It might seem like a blank slate, but it can make the house feel sterile and cold,” she says. “A neutral, like Farrow and Ball’s Wimborne White, or a colour-matched version of it, will look softer and calmer.”Don’t overlycommit to trends …A classic rookie mistake is to dive headfirst into a trend, says Ribchester, who suggests approaching hard fixtures and finishes which are expensive to change (tiles, taps, flooring) the same way you would if you were getting a tattoo: if it feels like a trend you’re likely to get bored with, don’t do it. Instead, have fun with the things you can switch out more easily, such as soft furnishings, art and even paint (though bear in mind darker colours are more costly to cover).…or to shopsAnother common mistake is to buy everything at once from the same few stores – a well-designed room is all about the juxtaposition of pieces that reflect who you are, says Ribchester. Bringing something old which might not perfectly “go”– a university poster perhaps, or a chair from your childhood bedroom, say – can stop it looking flat.Spend on things you can move“Built-in joinery is brilliant if you have a tiny space, but it’s also expensive and you can’t take it with you when you move,” says Constable. A well-chosen antique cupboard or chest of drawers is likely to be much cheaper and, unlike a piece of flatpack furniture, was built to last and designed to be repaired so it will happily move with you – try eBay, Facebook Marketplace orThe Saleroom.Beware the expensive sofaDon’t blow your first-home budget on a fancy sofa, Constable adds. “It will inevitably be the wrong size or shape for your next home.” Buy the sofa secondhand and invest instead in a nice armchair – “which will also be cheaper to re-cover down the line.”Go big on rugsIf you don’t have the budget to change the floors, buy the most generously sized rug you can, says Constable – you want your furniture to sit on it, not around it.Don’t rushAbove all, don’t rush, Gemma Luteijn, interior designer at Project London, says: “The best homes evolve slowly and look organically curated, rather than the product of quick, slapdash decisions.”First babyClose up of a baby’s bedroomPhotography: Franck Allais. Set stylist: Elena Horn.dollshouseshowcase.comDecorate your room firstWith a baby on the way, your social media feed is probably flooded with shots of pastel nursery makeovers. “The most common mistake people make is to decorate for the baby,” says Constable, “but they’re a baby for a brief period of time.” Most babies spend the first six months of their life in their parents’ bedroom, says Ribchester, so focus on that first. Add softness and comfort with the nicest bedding you can afford, a padded fabric headboard and a lovely pair of matching lamps which can be dimmed easily for night feeds (atouch-base onewith varying degrees of brightness can be easier than fumbling around for a switch). If space allows, a bedside chest of drawers is often more practical than a bedside table, with plenty of surface for baby paraphernalia. “Also, buy a nice, lidded basket you can throw dirty clothes and muslins into,” he adds.Choose wallpaper wiselyWhen you are decorating the baby’s room, do it with an older child in mind, says Constable: “Those large motif wallpapers are fun, but they age really quickly. I’d go for a really small pattern instead.” Sandberg has a range ofneutral ginghamsandfine stripeswhich should grow with your child. Afabric canopyover the bed is a less permanent way to add some fun – attached with a single ceiling hook, it can be removed when your child is too old for it: “We recently added a circus-inspired one to a child’s bed,” says Gemma Holsgrove, design director at Sims Hilditch.Avoid dedicated kids’ furniture“Instead of a short-lived changing table, consider an antique chest of drawers with a removable changing mat on top,” says Luteijn (getone in a patternwhich works with the colours of the room), and instead of buying a kids’ wardrobe, adapt a standard-size one with asecond hanging railwhich you can remove when your child gets bigger, says Constable. And don’t bother with a toddler bed, she adds, just go for a standard single with a removable safety side. “Upholster the headboard in a lovely dark plain weave fabric” so it’s practical and hard-wearing, but also soft enough to lean against for bedtime stories.TeenagersClose up of a teenager’s bedroomLet them have input – up to a point“Privacy and autonomy are both really important for teenagers, so let them have input in the decoration of their room,” says Ribchester. But also bear in mind teenagers can be fickle, so if in doubt about their long-term commitment to jet-black walls, stick to a neutral base, adds Constable: “Introduce a shade they love in the fabric of their headboard or cushions, then give them creative space with acork wallor largefabric pinboard.” Zara Cowen, interior designer at Huxley Home, says abespoke neon lightcosts less than you’d imagine, and can be a cool way to display their name or a favourite affirmation: “They often look good in the dead space of wall above the door.” Removablepeel and stick decalscan be a less permanent alternative to wallpaper.Give their clothes space to breatheCowen also recommendsHafele wire metal drawers, which can be fitted into wardrobes: “It’s good to get air circulating around that T-shirt that didn’t make it into the wash, and basket drawers are easier to find things in than shelves.”Mix up sheetsTo make bedding fun, Cowen suggestsPiglet in Bed’s mix-and-match bundles, which can be switched around seasonally to keep the room looking fresh.Futureproof electricsIf you’re doing any rewiring, says Luteijn, plan your electrics to accommodate a double bed (even if your child currently sleeps in a single) to make it easy to create a guest room when they eventually move out.Don’t knock through completelyIf you’re renovating downstairs, it’s best to think about a “broken” layout, rather than open-plan, says Constable: “If you live in a typical Victorian house with a double living room, plan for pocket doors between them to maintain separate rooms when your children are older.”Give them a clear study area …Though teenagers aren’t famously neat, a properly lit desk area that doesn’t have too much clutter in their eyeline is important for focus, says home organisation expertVicky Silverthorn, so find something with plenty of drawers underneath rather than shelves above.… plus another one downstairs“The workplacebody doubling theorysuggests we’re more productive when we work with others present, and it can apply to teenagers, too,” says Silverthorn. Try to carve out a second study space off the living area, even if it’s in a gap under stairs in the hallway, where they can work but feel connected to the family; a classic secondhand drop-leaf desk is a good option to hide clutter when it’s not in use.Create a no-phone zoneGiven the never-ending battle with teenagers over screens, try keeping one room or zone in the house totally phone-free, says Cowen – a little reading nook with bookshelves, or a table where you can play board games. A dedicated phone-charging drawer or shelf in the kitchen will help encourage this. You can even buydecorative “unplugged” boxesfor phones to go into – if you find the designs too schmaltzy, create your own with a prettymarbled-paper box.Empty-nestersClose up of a woman’s bedroomPut comfort firstYou’re likely to be at home more than ever at this stage, so invest just as much in how things feel as how they look, says Ribchester. For upholstery, prioritise plushness and softness, he says, “the kind of fabric you might have put off for years because it’s not spill-proof”.Furnish for the futureThink long-term if you’re getting a new sofa: “A feather-filled sofa cushion is heavy and could be increasingly difficult to lift and plump as you get older. A foam filling with a feather wrap is more practical,” says Constable. Something with a bit more “spring” than ‘“sink” will be easier to get in and out of in years to come. Likewise, for bathrooms, “a tiled bench within a shower or a wider tiled ledge around a bath adds practicality in a way that doesn’t feel overly adapted,” says Grazzie Wilson, head of creative attile brand Ca’ Pietra. “Opt for tiles with an R10 or R11 rating on the floor so they’re not too slippery,” she says. If you can afford to add underfloor heating in the bathroom, it will save cold winter mornings and dry slip-hazard puddles quickly, adds Cowen.Design to save your backIn the kitchen, Cowen recommends an eye-level oven so you don’t have to bend down; theNeff Slide and Hideis a good option if space is tightas the door retracts under it. Maxing out on kitchen drawers is a good way to avoid bending and stretching to root around for things buried in cupboards.Don’t completely erase the pastIt can be tempting to do a complete refresh when the kids have flown, but it’s also nice to have reminders of family history. Ribchester says one client renovating her bathroom asked builders to leave a Stüssy sticker her son had stuck to the window frame decades earlier.Create a memory wallThinking of downsizing? “Floor space is the most valuable real estate, so make use of the walls,” advises Silverthorn. Photo frames you have no space to display on surfaces can be turned into a family gallery wall, which looks especially good in transitional areas like hallways or landings. For other things you can’t hang on to, Silverthorn recommendsVintage Cash Cow, which will sell your belongings after getting them valued by experts.Be crafty with spare-bedroom space …If you’re not downsizing, make your spare bedrooms work harder by going multipurpose: have a craft room with a sofabed in it, or a dressing room with a hidden pull-down Murphy bed, likethis clever designby interiors influencer Jen Rothbury. Dorm rooms are also becoming increasingly popular for clients with grownup children as a fun way to accommodate family: “We recently created one using shop-bought bunk beds which we clad in MDF and painted with a fun cloud pattern so they looked bespoke,” says Ribchester. Otherwise, Cowen recommends Ikea’sstackable single bedsas a smart way to accommodate the grandkids.…and upgrade your ownFor your own bedroom, consider little luxuries like a tea-and-coffee station tucked into a wardrobe so you can have a hot drink in the morning without going downstairs, says Cowen. Sleep quality can decrease with age, so add blackout blinds if you don’t already have them, and – if your mattress is as old as your marriage – invest in a zip-and-link one with separate spring units to make you less likely to disturb your partner. “One client even got me to design two identical master bedrooms,” says Cowen, “neither wanted to feel they had been turfed out in the night because the other was snoring!”"

And chances are you know somebody who likes to lace up their running shoes, whether for a social jog at parkrun, to get fit via couch to 5k, or to add to their ultrarun medal collection.Whatever level the runner in your life, we have quizzed other keen pavement – or trail – pounders to uncover what kit, clothing, gadgetry and running paraphernalia is getting them excited this year.The best gifts for runners in 2025Stick to the trailsView image in fullscreenTrail running shoesWomen’s, £99.99 at SportsShoesMen’s, £160 at HokaJo Harley, who runs the Cornish coastal path three times a week and has taken part in various races and events, rates Hoka Mafate Speed 4 trainers “for grip on the slippy trails.I got them for my birthday in September and ran the Rosemullion 10k in them.”Highly visibleView image in fullscreenWomen’s hooded run jacket£39.99 at SportsShoesAs the winter nights draw in, Harley recommends her Higher State Allover Reflect hi-vis jacket “to be seen and dry – this jacket is good value and is very visible, for safer night running”.Keep heatedView image in fullscreenMultifunctional neckwear£25.95 at Buff£14.21 at AmazonHarley also wants “a decent buff to keep the wind out my ears because they hurt when it’s cold. It can act like a neck- and ear-warmer; when it’s cold I wear two: one round my neck and one like a headband over my ears. My Merino Move one is best for the extra cold days.”Light the wayView image in fullscreenRechargeable head torch£254.95 at Fenix£218.87 at AmazonDenise Roach, ofBlack Girls Do Run UK, has been running for more than 20 years. “It has definitely helped me navigate the ups and downs,” she says. This Christmas she’d love a rechargeable head torch, such as the Fenix HP35R: “I’ve got some long winter runs ahead in preparation for my next ultra, so visibility is essential.”On the runView image in fullscreenRunning shoesWomen’s, £130 at SauconyMen’s, £130 at SauconyWhen it comes to treads, Roach is eyeing up these Saucony Guide 18 shoes in coral red “for great winter visibility and all-round comfort. I tried them for the first time this year and they immediately felt great; comfortable with the right level of cushioning for those long urban runs. With winter training ahead of a January ultra, I’ll need something to see me through. The colour is just to give me a welcome boost!”Heat those handsView image in fullscreenWind-block gloves£32 at Ronhill£29.99 at AmazonSimilarly essential for winter runs, Roach wants winter running gloves because “there’s nothing worse than cold hands on a long run”. She describes these Ronhill wind-block gloves as “cosy and practical. They were recommended by an experienced running friend as the perfect hand protectors. Ronhill has always produced proper kit for ‘proper’ runners.”Vest foot forwardView image in fullscreenRunning vest£80.99 at SportsShoes£90 at SalomonA teammate ofRoach, Sheryne Shillingford-Reed is “on a mission to run all the majors and the SuperHalfs, along with closer -to-home series, like Great Runs, fundraising to give back to communities and good causes”. To help with these endeavours, she’s after this Salomon Pulse 2 running vest, which is “lightweight and designed to showcase your team or charity”.Tech-savvy stepsView image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 55 watch£179.99 at GarminView image in fullscreenGarmin Forerunner 570 watch£459.99 at GarminFor Shillingford-Reed, the Garmin Forerunner 55 is “a great entry-level watch, perfect for the not-so-casual runner who is ready to start upping their game. Only noted your parkrun stats before? Now you can check out all your stats and not have to wait for that email!” She also dreams of a Garmin Forerunner 570. “It’s not a top-of-the-range model, but a step up from a basic running watch. This will get you from half-marathon- to ultramarathon-level running.”Words of inspirationView image in fullscreenThe Power Within£20 at the Guardian BookshopView image in fullscreenUltra Women: The Trailblazers Defying Sexism in Sport£16.99 at WaterstonesLisa Jackson, author of Still Running After All These Tears: A Runner’s Journey Through Grief,would love a copy of ultrarunner Sophie Power’s book, The Power Within. “Best known for breastfeeding her baby during the 106-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, Sophie has set two world records, and campaigns to dismantle the barriers that prevent women from entering races. I’m keen to learn more about the mental tricks that enabled her to run 230.46 miles on a treadmill for 48 hours,” says Jackson. “I’d also love Ultra Women by Lily Canter and Emma Wilkinson. It celebrates athletes such as Jasmin Paris, who have completed unbelievable endurance challenges,” she says.Hit the roadView image in fullscreenMen’s £150 at HokaWomen’s £150 at Hoka“Gear I’ve got my eye on includes a new pair of Hoka Skyflows as my current ones are starting to wear out and I’m training for the 2026 Brighton Marathon,” says Jackson. “The owner of Run, my local running shop, recommended them to me. They’re so fantastically cushioned that it’s like running on pillows and I credit them with successfully getting me through this year’s Brighton event.”Pockets aplentyView image in fullscreenFive-litre race vest£39.99 at HarrierJackson is also coveting a Harrier Curbar race vest. “It has nine pockets to stash all my bits and bobs, and even loops for carrying foldable trail-running poles. Harrier is well respected in trail circles – there was a queue round the block at its stand at theNational Running Show.”Choc-fulView image in fullscreenRace-day chocolate, box of 21 110g bars£40.95 at Cadbury“I always break out a bar of Dairy Milk at the 18-mile (30km) mark of a marathon, and it goes down a storm with my fellow competitors,” says Jackson. “It’s not evidence-based nutrition, but it lifts my spirits – and my blood sugar – like nothing else.”Hot digitsView image in fullscreenRun gloves£30 at Hoka“I’m generally warm on a run as long as my hands are warm,” says David Atherton, Bake Off winner and keen runner, who ran the London Marathon two years ago and has two half-marathons lined up for 2026. “My current running gloves are rubbish, so I want a pair of these Hoka Airolite ones!”Post-run rescueView image in fullscreenMassage bar£9 at LushWhen you’re clocking up the miles, you need a treat when you get home. “I used these Lush Wiccy Magic Musclesbars when I was preparing for the London Marathon and I loved the smell,” says Atherton.A salt and bath-eryView image in fullscreenBath salts£17 at Neal’s Yard“These Neal’s Yard aromaticbath salts are also particularly good after a long run,” says Atherton. “The rich, spicy scent turned recovery into a small ritual I actually looked forward to.”Compact coverView image in fullscreenRunning gilet£164.99 at Nike“I have an older iteration of Nike’s Therma-FIT ADV Repel AeroLoft running gilet and I love it,” says Atherton. “It’s so light and if you get too warm it packs down so you can carry it in your hand.”Muscle soothingView image in fullscreenMassage gun£125 at Therabody“I love my massage gun– it’s an easy way to recover when you’re feeling tired. Stretching takes a lot more effort,” says Atherton. “This Theragun Mini travels easily when doing races in other countries, and it can be hidden from family members who try to steal it.”Balm me up, ScottyView image in fullscreenAnti-chafe balm£14.99 at Body Glide“This is a great alternative to Vaseline; it’s smooth and glides on for those areas that rub or chafe,” says Wong. A great stocking filler.Keep things sweetView image in fullscreenPost-run treat£1.45 at OcadoFor a cheeky stocking filler, Wong suggests a bag of festive sweets, such as Haribo Merry Mix. “I wake up on Christmas Day, go for a run and then enjoy some festive candy – it’s OK to eat some highly processed, sugary food – it’s Christmas!”Well gelView image in fullscreenEnergy gels, pack of three£9.49 at Precision HydrationPatrick Lee, who is running his first marathon next year, in London, is keen for some energy gels to get through gruelling training runs. “These PF 30 caffeine gels are easy to carry and will fuel me with carbs as well as caffeine,” he says.Vested interestView image in fullscreenWater bottle£125 at Salomon“Carrying a water bottle in your hand can mess with your technique, so I prefer a running vest,” says Lee. “This one is a great all-rounder and has lots of pockets for your keys, phone and gels. I follow quite a few running experts on YouTube, and the Salomon ADV Skin 5 and 12s are the ones that people always mention and benchmark other vests against. The Skin 12 is more for ultra-runners while the Skin 5 is for road-runners.”Ready to be steadyView image in fullscreenTempo-building shoesMen’s £139.99 at SportsShoesWomen’s £139.99 at SportsShoesDesigned for tempo running, they also work for long, steady training runs. “These nylon plated shoes – Saucony Endorphin Speed 5 – are a great addition.

At 1.30pm, she loads her banged-up Tacoma with her three Belgian malinois and drives to a secret Los Angeles hiking trail. There, she gulps down a tapioca pudding and laces up her sneakers. After checking over her shoulder for foot traffic, she pulls down her brown sweatpants and jiggles her bare ass for the camera. Then come the undies. Her coiffed landing strip hovers above the rocks as a rush of urine floods the trail. Every mile she walks, she films another video: a flash, a moon, a finger up the ass.When Barey decided in 2020 to pursue porn full-time, she did not imagine that at 28 she would spend more time hunched over a desk – not in the fun way – making flow charts, scheduling Zoom calls, and sending pitch decks. “I’m at my happiest when I’m making a video like putting a strawberry in my butt and pushing it out,” she says. “Now I’m on calls all day and I have tech neck.” Known online as the “Anal Princess”, with large, blinking Shelley Duvall eyes and an American Girl doll pout, she will try anything once – even the title “tech founder”.Barey is looking to disrupt the porn landscape with Hidden, a site designed to alleviate creator burnout and restore the fun in making and consuming adult content – a place where, unlike OnlyFans, she can post public exposure and piss clips from her daily lunch-break hikes.You can’t be spending your entire day making content, promoting it on socials. It’s unsustainableStella BareyHidden arrives during an uncertain time for porn, especially for gen Z. They are skeptical of it, raised on it and increasingly behind the camera themselves. The platform reflects the DIY sensibility that Barey’s generation grew up with, and its mission speaks to their conflicted relationship with big tech, sex work and making a living online. “At the end of the day, Hidden is more than porn,” Barey says. “It’s a political statement” – and one of the only sex worker-founded sex-tech companies hosting adult content today.Born in San Juan Capistrano, California and raised by a gynaecologist mother, Barey cannot remember a time when she was not insatiably curious about her body. At NYU, she invented her own major – ethical healthcare systems and policy – then finished med school prerequisites for gynaecology at University of California, Los Angeles, where she gravitated to the city’s X-rated underbelly: sex parties, industry mixers, late-night friendships with porn girls. Trapped in her apartment during the first wave of Covid, grinding through schoolwork, she started experimenting with anal sex with her then boyfriend – and sharing her sexploits via dirty story times on TikTok. “This is when TikTok still felt like this hidden little piece of the internet,” she recalls.Rise of the ‘porno-trolls’: how one porn platform made millions suing its viewersRead moreHer third video went viral. Men in the comments wanted her OnlyFans. Women wanted more story times. By 2021, Barey had given them both. OnlyFans bikini shots and nude selfies pulled in more than $40,000 a month – enough to make medical school look optional. She dropped out, figuring the white coat would wait for her. On TikTok, she became the horny professor to a cult following of gen Z women, quoting Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud and Marquis de Sade as she spoke about the color of her vagina, STD checks, treating bacterial vaginosis (BV) and inserting a menstrual sponge – and the delights of anal sex.“I was making the sacrifice of potentially ruining my reputation to speak about sexual health and sexual topics, things 99% of the girls my age are also thinking about, in a non-stigmatized way,” Barey says. (Having a gynaecologist mom on speed dial helped.) By 2022, she had hit 750,000 TikTok followers and a $285,000 month on OnlyFans.It didn’t last. Four years prior, in 2018,federal lawmade websites legally liable for hosting material linked to sex trafficking. Spooked by the law as well as mounting pressure from banks, advertisers and religious lobbying groups, Instagram and TikTok began issuing “community violations” for even thehint of sexual content. The word obscenity, long the legal standard for what counts as “too sexual”, remained deliberately undefined, giving them carte blanche to remove anything that made them nervous. Adult creators wereshadowbanned, deleted and demonetized without warning. But they could not afford to leave the mainstream platforms altogether – that’s where they advertised their content and built fanbases.View image in fullscreenStella Barey.Photograph: Courtesy of Stella BareyTo survive, they developed their own internet survival codes, resorting to “algospeak” to circumvent obscenity guidances (“corn” for porn, “seggs” for sex, “accountant” for sex worker), VPNs and burner accounts to evade detection, and private Discords to swap intel. “We became outlaws,” Barey says. “You have no clue what is allowed or not allowed until you get hit with a violation. It’s all word of mouth.”By the end of 2022, Barey had gone through 22 TikTok accounts, many with more than 600,000 followers, buying burner phones to start from scratch each time she got booted from the platform.Severely limited by mainstream sites, sex workers sought out new havens for posting adult content, the most popular of which is OnlyFans. Whereas Pornhub and its peers monetize traffic through ads and streaming, OnlyFans monetizes relationships, letting creators sell directly to fans. By 2024, more than 4.6 million creators werepulling in$7.2bn from subscribers. But OnlyFans comes with its own set of problems. The platform is notorious for lacking creator-friendly tools. Unlike Instagram or TikTok, there is no “explore” page or discovery feed; the burden of finding an audience falls entirely on the performer, which means relentless self-promotion on the very sites that are so hostile to them. “People don’t realize that most of these girls don’t want to be doing social media – they just want to make porn,” Barey says.Once fans do make it to a creator’s page, monthly subscriptions account for only a fraction of potential earnings. The real money comes from time-consuming manual engagement, such as selling custom videos, sexts and one-to-one messaging. At one point, 70% of Barey’s income came from these direct messages. “You can’t be spending your entire day making content, promoting it on socials, and also be on your account selling to fans 24/7,” she says. “It’s unsustainable.”Everyone is getting sick of the OnlyFans model. We’re exhausted and burnt outLeila LewisThe idea for Hidden began in 2023, when a high school friend and Wharton business school grad approached Barey about co-founding a porn site. Barey set the terms: a platform designed by and for sex workers, built to promote passive income in an industry where constant performance is often the price of survival. The platform launched on 12 April with a sleek black interface and artful branding. Focused on amateur content, it recalls the Tumblr-era cam girl aesthetic – a period many creators look back on with fondness. (“Hidden” is a reference to the phone folder in which normies keep their nudes.)After clicking “18+”, users land on a TikTok-style “For You” page that serves clips tailored to their taste. Scrolling through videos and photos, one can find anything from a girl-next-door-type smiling in her pyjamas to a performer gyrating on a lubed-up dildo. See someone you like? A quick swipe to that creator’s profile is usually where the first paywall appears: a small fee to unlock their feed, view explicit posts or send a message.Barey is most excited about the ways Hidden, unlike OnlyFans, helps creators keep earning without constantly filming or messaging. The site’s algorithm promotes old videos as much as new ones, and each profile includes a built-in store where fans can buy clips and pay-per-view posts – content that creators have already made, now working for them in the background.None of Hidden’s features are brand new, Barey admits. The scrolling feed is lifted from RedGifs; the store from ManyVids; and the chargeback protections, popular among creators for making it harder for customers to dispute charges and get refunds, from SextPanther. But they are consolidated on Hidden, which also takes the smallest cut in the industry (18% of creators’ earnings, compared with OnlyFans’ 20%).For Leila Lewis, 28, a Philadelphia-based creator making over $30,000 a month on OnlyFans, the appeal was immediate. “Everyone is getting sick of the OnlyFans model. We’re exhausted and burnt out,” she says. After a consultation with Barey, she said Hidden felt like a return to the golden days – something that finally made her excited about the work again. “You can’t do fisting or pee content on OnlyFans,” which is the content her fans like best but is prohibited on themore skittishplatform, Lewis explains. “That’s why I love Hidden, because they just let you do pretty much anything.”View image in fullscreenBarey speaks at a Hidden event for creators in September.Photograph: Stella BareyBarey oversees a 40-person software team, a product designer and six content moderators, and more features are on the way. Barey and her team are building a takedown bot to scan the internet for leaks and stolen content with a single click. She is experimenting with AI tools that would let fans request personalized clips generated from a performer’s likeness (for instance, “me in a red dress on a plane”), while safeguarding ownership of their likeness from sites that are already selling nonconsensual AI versions of them. Barey even wants Hidden to handle its own payments instead of relying on third-party payment processors – an unheard-of move in the adult industry that would cut out the middlemen that drive up fees. (If she could buy a bank outright, she says, creators might one day keep nearly all of what they earn.)Ultimately, she insists it’s sex workers who will decide what comes next for Hidden. “I have a list of thousands of things, but if I’m hearing from the girls that they really want live streaming, I’m going to put that up at the top.” Meanwhile, her core crew of gen Z assistants – Drew, Chloe and Naomi, who once ran her OnlyFans and now act as her “angels” – weigh in on everything from marketing strategy to her sex tape’s final cut. Years of navigating porn sites and the minefield of social media have given them an instinct for what will resonate.So far, Hidden has registered over 113,000 users who have spent on average $53 each, and has enrolled more than 2,100 active creators – most of them gen Z women.At this momentpublic sentiment toward porn is souring. That’s in part due to the rise of “rage bait” porn, the kind of deliberately provocative content that first launched Barey into viral fame, when her TikTok about sleeping with her father’s fiftysomething best friend broke the internet. Gen Z creators such asBonnie Blueand Lily Phillips, whose exhibitionist gangbang spectacles were engineered to be detested, thrive in an ecosystem warped by burnout, censorship, algorithmic whiplash, “slop” churn, and audiences with ever-shortening attention spans. For critics, they are proof the industry has lost its grip.The backlash also mirrors cultural anxieties about sex, gender and power among gen Z. By age 13, most US teens havealready encounteredpornography, often by accident. Gen Z is the first cohort to grow up with porn not just available but ambient, algorithmically unavoidable.A generation of ‘virgins’ is leading America’s next sexual revolutionRead moreThe American Survey Center’s 2025reportfound that nearly two-thirds of men under 25 now support making online pornography harder to access – a sharp increase from previous generations. This shift could be tied to growing discomfort with porn’s ubiquity, as well as a broader conservative turn among young people (as you can see in the “NoFap” and abstinence trends spreading across TikTok). At the same time, feminist critics, gen Z or otherwise, are calling out the damaging effects of some porn, fromnormalized chokingto transactional “porn-script” sex bleeding into dating culture.Interestingly, survey data shows gen Z reports less sexual activity than earlier generations, suggesting a more cautious cohort. And yet, new Kinsey Instituteresearchfinds gen Z to be the most kink-friendly generation on record.Internet porn historian Noelle Perdue argues that the contradictions themselves are the story. “There is among younger generations this resentment towards the concept of mainstream pornography,” she says, “but they are also genuinely curious about their sexuality.” What gen Z is open to, she adds, is ethically produced porn that matches their sensitivities and desires. Recent Pornhubdataalso shows a broader cultural shift toward authenticity in porn: searches for “ethical porn” rose 92% in 2024, while “authentic sex” climbed 43%, meaning viewers are increasingly drawn to user-generated and amateur content over scripted, studio productions that can feel unrealistic.“Ethical porn”, a recent buzzword in the industry, generally refers to erotic content that is transparently and legally produced, fairly paid and filmed with mutual pleasure in mind; feminist porn filmmakers such as Erika Lust are often held up as the gold standard. Hidden is, in that sense, as ethical as a platform can reasonably claim to be: its content is self-filmed by age-verified performers who own their work and keep most of what they earn. However, one can never be entirely sure what is or is not ethical without being in the room where the sex is happening.Between her time on TikTok and an in-person erotic philosophy reading series she started last February, Barey has drawn in a wide circle of college-aged women. “I know there’s a rise in conservatism amongst gen Z, but I see this generation as the most accepting of porn of any generation yet,” she says. “They’re so supportive of sex work and understanding it as a legitimate job.”Tech companies have a long history of establishing financial sustainability by hosting explicit content and then suddenly abandoning itNoelle PerdueBy the time young people have worked out what they want – or do not want – from porn, it might be a moot point. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 went so far as toopenly callfor pornography to be outlawed and its producers imprisoned, indicating a rightwing thirst for a national ban on the industry. A less existential but more immediate threat are newage-verification lawsacross the US and UK that require users to upload government IDs or biometric data before accessing porn. Lawmakers frame these bills as child-protection measures, but in practice they penalize the very platforms trying to comply and slash the income of sex workers –especially queer and trans creatorsalready working on razor-thin margins. When Louisiana’s Act 440 went into effect in 2023, Pornhubreportedan 80% drop in traffic from the state, while VPN searches spiked. As Perdue notes, minors will always find adult content; what these laws actually do is punish compliant platforms like Hidden, OnlyFans and Pornhub, andfunnel userstoward sketchier sites rife with pirated or nonconsensual material.As of now, porn stillaccountsfor more than a third of internet data transfers. Its future could depend on creators finally taking control of the industry they built. “Tech companies have a long history of establishing financial sustainability by hosting explicit content and then suddenly abandoning it,” Perdue says. “It would be amazing to have this pattern disrupted by a company that is truly aligned with sex workers, instead of just seeing adult content as a means to a financial end.”Three dogs pant out of open windows as Barey’s pickup barrels down the freeway, away from the hiking trail. She will miss the beginning of her 2.30pm call, a meeting with her chief technology officer to review Hidden’s next software update. There is no signal on this stretch, so for a few more minutes she can remain in her favorite role – just another horny girl on the internet with a camera roll filled with nudes.“Even though porn has been around forever, this version of online sex work is so brand new,” Barey says. In this way, Hidden may be less a product than a provocation – an argument that an industry dismissed as slop can still be reinvented."

The Germany international’s difficult start in the Premier League – where he is yet to score or assist before Sunday’s visit to Manchester City – prompted a withering assessment by Wenger before the visit of Real.Wenger claimed on beIN Sports: “When Wirtz had the choice between going to Bayern Munich orLiverpool, he said to Liverpool: ‘I come to you if I play No 10. I do not want to play wide.’ Liverpool, to get him, they say OK. They started him and they destroyed their midfield, which was [Ryan] Gravenberch, [Alexis] Mac Allister, [Dominik] Szoboszlai. To play Wirtz, they took Szoboszlai out. What have they done? They have gone back to their midfield of last year.”More in common: how Sheikh Mansour is linked to Liverpool’s ownerRead moreWenger’s last point is correct, with last season’s title-winning midfield restored for victories over Aston Villa and the current leaders of La Liga. Liverpool’s performances were markedly improved and they kept a clean sheet in both games, after failing to keep one in the previous 10 matches. Slot, however, believes a better understanding between teammates is key to the overall development and not simply the position that Wirtz plays.“Everyone has a right to his own opinion,” said the Liverpool head coach on Wenger. “We have five or six very good midfielders who can all play together but they need to play more together to get the best out of every single player. Florian needs time to adapt to his teammates and teammates need time to adapt to him. Now he played off the left but I can tell you, if it is not now it is tomorrow, he will have great performances as a midfielder for Liverpool as well.”City were keen on signing Wirtz at the start of the summer transfer window but claim to have been put off by the financial package involved to bring him from Bayer Leverkusen. Wirtz’s camp, meanwhile, suggested he cooled on City owing to doubts over Pep Guardiola’s long-term future at the club. Slot, who hopes to have Alexander Isak available after almost three weeks out with a groin problem, insists Wirtz can become a dominant figure in the Premier League, as a No 10 or an inverted winger.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak has returned to Liverpool training after a groin niggle.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“He definitely has the talent for it, but it’s not only about one player,” Slot added. “It’s also about the team you are playing in. What I can say about Florian is that since Xabi Alonso came in [at Leverkusen] he was mainly used in a 3-4-3 system as an inverted winger, where before that he mainly played as a 10. In the national team he plays as an inverted winger as well.“For me the only challenge I have is making sure he gets in those positions, as an inverted winger or as a 10, in and around the 18-yard box where his teammates need to find him with the right timing, because then he will always produce special things. He does this for the national team, he did it for Leverkusen and he’s already done that for us as well.”Slot admits he has changed the Liverpool team more than he would have wished this season and, unusually for him, became agitated when explaining how injuries to Mac Allister, Conor Bradley, Jeremie Frimpong and Isak gave him no alternative.“There have been obvious reasons why we’ve had to change more than I would like,” he said. “Mac Allister as an example – if you miss out on pre-season then you’re not ready to play three games in seven days. If you do, you will get injuries.“I can show multiple examples to you – Alex [Isak] is one, by the way. It’s so obvious for me and I’m a bit like, you can maybe feel it: ‘Jesus, why don’t you see these things? Why are you talking about me changing?’ when it’s so obvious why.“I’m known as being a manager who prefers not to change, but I couldn’t do anything different to what I did. Then, of course, we brought new players in and they have to adapt. You know what I want to say now? I want to talk about the last game when I saw a dive which 100% should have been a second yellow [for Vinícius Júnior]. I never hear about how many referee decisions have gone against us in the last six or seven weeks.”Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotArsène WengernewsShareReuse this content"

You would certainly have had decent odds back then on the home side’s reserve prop Joe Marler becoming a national TV treasure, a fever dream roughly on a par with Claudia Winkleman shaving off her hair and packing down at loosehead. Who knew?But here we are in an increasingly parallel universe. Big Joe now has Alan Carr and Sir Stephen Fry on speed dial while England, sincethe 30-22 defeatin August 2023, have also undergone their own extreme makeover. Having been a team who, by the admission of their own coach early in his tenure, “weren’t good at anything” they are now hoping to extend an eight-match winning run afterdefeating Australia comfortablylast week.Pollock proves the key before England cavalry seal victory over AustraliaRead moreNowadays they can make nine changes – including two new faces on the bench – and field a combination which, on paper, could be even more of an attacking handful. While Fiji have some eye-catching individuals of their own they will also have to deal with an England bench which is starting to munch through wilting opponents late on like a very hungry caterpillar.Perhaps most valuable of all, Steve Borthwick’s squad can now beat teams in a variety of ways. To some extent that ambition has been driven by the rising pace of the game at Test level but the days of simply sticking it up the gilet have gone. Last Saturday they outplayed the Wallabies in the air and suffocated them with their stifling defence. This weekend Fiji’s big men can expect a subtly different menu.No team with Marcus Smith at full-back, for starters, is going to sit back and simply wait for the Fijians to take the initiative. It could also be argued, with Chandler Cunningham-South at No 8, Guy Pepper and Ben Earl on the flanks, and Ollie Chessum and Alex Coles in the second row, that England have rarely named a starting pack with a more mobile back five.Stir in the instinctive club understanding of their Northampton starting quintet – Coles, Alex Mitchell, Fin Smith, Fraser Dingwall and Tommy Freeman – plus their bleach-hairedDuracell bunny Henry Pollockon the bench and there is the potential – weather permitting – for Borthwick’s reshuffled lineup to reveal a whole other dimension of themselves.View image in fullscreenEllis Genge (second left) wants a different result against Fiji after he was captain for the defeat in 2023.Photograph: Dan Mullan/RFU/The RFU Collection/Getty ImagesWhich, of course, is specifically part of the wider grand design. While South Africa’s Rassie Erasmus is a restless innovator, Borthwick’s speciality lies in sharpening tactical gameplans to the finest of points. Now England have mastered the art of not melting away in the final reel like cinema ice-creams, they are starting to enjoy the challenge of tailoring performances to the opposition in front of them.Borthwick had a bespoke selection plan in mind for this fixture before the Australia game, influenced by the arrival of the All Blacks in town next week. It was never going to make longer-term sense, either, for George Ford to start every week at fly-half or for Maro Itoje to play every available minute. For next week’s New Zealand encounter it is likely Itoje, Tom Curry and, probably, Ford, will all start but there is obvious mileage in fuelling competition for places elsewhere.Regardless of who plays, though, what England fans would really love to see is the hosts playing with the handbrake fully off. Against the Wallabies, despite the convincing final scoreline, guess how many offloads they managed in 80 minutes? The answer is just four, albeit in less than ideal conditions. Along with a garnish of 16 handling errors, 16 turnovers, and 14 penalties and free-kicks conceded.This time there should be scope for greater ambition and, specifically, getting the ball into the hands of their dangerous wide threats more often. Manny Feyi‑Waboso, likened to the supreme Jason Robinson by Kevin Sinfield this week, is too good to be restricted to a handful of shovelled passes. Likewise Henry Arundell, involved again (albeit off the bench) for the first time since the World Cup.For various reasons England have not always felt able to spread their wings consistently but, with Lee Blackett now presiding over their attack, this is a day when, frankly, they can give it a lash without worrying unduly about the consequences. Earl at centre, Pollock on the wing and Arundell at full-back? The last quarter may involve one or two funky combinations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Courtney Lawes spoke and said: ‘This doesn’t define us. We’ll bounce back and be better for it.’”Unflappable George Ford the safe option for England, Borthwick and brigadier | Andy BullRead moreThat, as it turned out, is exactly what happened. Genge also detects a very different vibe to one of the previous times he captained England, two and a half years ago against France who romped away toa record 53-10 victory. “I immediately had a few boys coming up to me saying: ‘Let’s hope it goes better than last time,’” said Genge. “[But] we’re a completely different side. Not just personnel-wise but the brand of rugby … the way we play the game now is way different.”Their defence has also tightened up significantly but do not expect one-way traffic. Fiji are ranked ninth in the world – ahead of Italy and Wales – and barely a whisker behind Scotland. If this game were being played in Suva it might be another story but there is still no imminent sign of that happening. These two sides are set to meet again next July in the new Nations Championship but it is understood that, for financial reasons, the fixture will take place in Europe.It is just another snapshot of international rugby’s still uneven playing field. While Fiji did somehow manage to bridge that vast canyon in 2023 – and also gave England a hurry-up in the World Cup quarter-finals – that was then. Now England are back on thunder road it is hard to see lightning striking twice.Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamFiji rugby union teamAutumn Nations SeriesRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That has brought inevitable pressure on to the 22-year-old’s shoulders with Amorim revealing that while he is relaxed about the situation, the player himself is not. “I understand how things are in football, and he’s going to struggle,” said the head coach. “He has no experience here, and when everyone says that you are the next big thing, you hear that. If you don’t perform every week, you are going to hear from club legends, from pundits, the media, and sometimes they are right.Leny Yoro: ‘Manchester United cannot build something with bad energy or bad characters’Read more“The ability to understand that this is normal and maintain your confidence is really hard for a kid, and especially for a kid that wants to control everything. He is not going to control everything.” It is understood that Sesko is meticulous regarding his preparation, arriving at the training ground at 8am and often leaving as late as 4pm.After last weekend’s2-2 drawat Nottingham Forest, Gary Neville claimed that Sesko was “miles off it”. Amorim was asked if these type of comments affect players. “Nobody likes to hear [that],” he said. “[Sesko has] struggled a little bit so let’s embrace that.“It’s not personal – that’s what I try to explain to the players. It’s an opinion that [could] change in a few weeks. What is true today, in three weeks could be different. My advice to Ben is you are going to get used to [hearing such opinions] and then it’s going to be natural – be like your Monday here. So we are going to help and protect Ben because he works so hard and wants to succeed.”Amorim went on to suggest that Bruno Fernandes may have to accept being rested next season if United again have European football. “We have one game per week so I’m not thinking about rotation. In the future – yes, [this] is something Bruno needs to understand,” said Amorim. “If you want to win every game and [have] European games, [I am] going to rotate. So for Bruno to put in his head that maybe next year he’s going to be in rotation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Still, a point has been made.Bellingham and Foden earn England recalls as Wharton and Scott also pickedRead moreBellingham had much to ponder after being left out of last month’s squad. He watched England secure their spot at next summer’s World Cup without him. He watched Morgan Rogers excel as a counterpressing No 10. He heard Tuchel talk about loving the group’s energy and values. Inevitably, Bellingham has responded in champion style, scoring crucial goals for Real Madridagainst Barcelonaand Juventus. He had to be picked; another omission would have left his World Cup hopes hanging by a thread.The hope is that Tuchel will have a Bellingham focused on intimidating opponents rather than teammates. After all, on a pure footballing level, there is no value to picking a fight with one of the best players in the world. The best outcome is that Bellingham’s time on the sidelines has shown him that an international career is a precious, precarious thing. Tuchel, for his part, can now throw a protective shield around the 22-year-old after proving that he is not afraid to make big calls.“There is no problem with him, there is no problem with the character,” the German said. “Jude just has the edge. You need a certain edge to reach the heights that he reached. We all need to help him and create an environment which he can [have] this edge towards opponents and towards the goals we are building as a team.”Bellingham dominated much of the focus at Tuchel’s squad announcement for this month’s dead-rubber qualifiers against Serbia and Albania. Who else? Well, how about Phil Foden? Here is another prodigious No 10 in need of love and guidance. Foden has not played for England since March and has struggled to hit the heights this year but Tuchel could not ignore the 25-year-old after his performance inManchester City’s win against Borussia Dortmundthis week.View image in fullscreen‘There is no problem with the character – Jude just has the edge you need,’ said Thomas Tuchel of Bellingham.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe question, though, is how to use the various creators at England’s disposal. Rogers and Eberechi Eze deserve their spots and there will be a strong case to pick Cole Palmer once he recovers from a persistent groin problem. Would taking five No 10s to the World Cup be too many? Gareth Southgate never found the right blend at Euro 2024. He compromised by squeezing Foden and Bellingham into the same XI, cramping Harry Kane’s style in the process.It is hard to see Tuchel doing similar if it hurts the attacking balance. There is room for one No 10, with speedy wingers on the flanks. Clarity helps. Bellingham is in as a No 10. Bournemouth’s Alex Scott, called up for the first time, is a No 8 and the recalled Adam Wharton will compete with Elliot Anderson as a No 6. There will also be no wide role for Foden, who has to be central. Tuchel wants him close to Kane. “It does not make sense to tell Phil: ‘We want you on the pitch but there’s no space on your best position, can you play left wing? Can you play right wing?’” he said. “Phil will play in the No 9-10ish position, in the middle of the pitch. I have this fantasy about him for a long time. I think it suits him the most.”Tuchel agreed there are times when Foden has not looked himself in an England shirt. “You feel almost like, ‘Does he really enjoy it?’ And a player like him who has this childish joy to play football, then obviously something is not right, be it the position, the environment, I don’t know.“I think he is also so used to playing for Man City in a certain structure, to have a clear task. I think he profits a lot from clarity. Where do you want me to be? In which positions should I turn? Where am I supposed to accelerate the match? Where do I have to defend?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said he has a longlist of 60 players. Morgan Gibbs-White, Myles Lewis-Skelly, James Trafford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek have dropped out. Nico O’Reilly is rewarded for his fine form for City at left-back. Intrigue abounds.2:30'We're delighted to have them back': Tuchel recalls Bellingham and Foden to England squad – videoThe omission of Ollie Watkins means there is no direct replacement for Kane in this squad. Fascinatingly, Tuchel hinted at using Foden as a false 9 against Serbia or Albania. Anthony Gordon, Marcus Rashford, Bellingham and Jarrod Bowen are other options should Kane be unavailable. With qualification secured this is a moment for a little experimentation.Meanwhile, it is also a moment to get Kane’s relationship with Bellingham going. It is remarkable that you have to go back to the latter setting up the captain to score ina friendly win against Scotlandin September 2023 to find the one and only time in 35 games for England when the duo combined for a goal. Tuchel will know that Kane and Bellingham only passed to each other once during England’s draws with Denmark and Slovenia at the Euros. The connection is missing.“This is where at some point it becomes the responsibility of the players,” Tuchel said. He is not afraid to deliver home truths. There is still a sense of Bellingham being on trial. He cannot even be guaranteed to start against Serbia and Albania. Tuchel wants Bellingham onside but he will be watching him carefully. Leave the ego at the door. It will make a very strong England team an even better one.Explore more on these topicsEnglandJude BellinghamThomas TuchelanalysisShareReuse this content"

Then Sabalenka again demonstrated her peerless fighting spirit by holding off Amanda Anisimova in a brilliant encounter to win 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.After playing her best tennis of the season over the past few weeks to qualify for theWTA Finals, Rybakina entered Riyadh filled with confidence and this has shown in her performances throughout the tournament. Like Sabalenka, the Kazakhstani has reached the final with a spotless scorecard, winning all four of her matches.Still, things were difficult early on against Pegula. Rybakina was unsettled by the American’s relentless depth, consistency and ability to absorb her pace. She ended the opening set with 25 unforced errors while repeatedly gesturing towards her right shoulder, which was bandaged from the beginning of the match. However, as she worked herself into the contest, Rybakina completely overpowered Pegula during parts of the final two sets with her clean, destructive groundstrokes and she ended the match with 15 aces.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina made her power tell despite nursing an injury to her right shoulder.Photograph: Fatima Shbair/APAs was the case inSeptember’s US Open final, Sabalenka’s performance against Anisimova underlined her growth as a tennis player and competitor. The 24-year-old Anisimova has established herself as the purest shotmaker in women’s tennis. Instead of merely trying to outhit her, Sabalenka won through a superior defence, intelligence and an ability to absorb Anisimova’s immense pace, impressively outmanoeuvring the American to reach the final stage of the WTA Finals for the second time.Elsewhere, Novak Djokovic moved into the final of the Hellenic Championship in Athens with a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over Yannick Hanfmann. Djokovic’s victory means that he will have minimal rest should he choose to compete at the ATP Finals, which begins just one day after Saturday’s final, and where the rest of the competitors have spent the last two days preparing for the start of the competition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As soon as the referee pointed to the spot at Slavia Prague on Tuesday, Arsenal’s goalkeeper sprinted to the touchline to confer with the coach Iñaki Caña in a routine that began when the pair first worked together at Brentford. No matter that Arsenal were cruising at 3-0 up with five minutes remaining and on their wayto a 10th straight victory– Raya was on the verge of creating history if he could save the penalty and keep the team’s eighth successive clean sheet.In the end, the video assistant referee came to Arsenal’s rescue and the penalty was overturned, although Raya did have to save a simple effort from Youssoupha Mbodji in injury time from Slavia’s only shot on target. It was only the seventh save he has made in four Champions League games, in which he has yet to concede a goal. Incredibly, since Nick Woltemade scored past Raya for Newcastle on 28 September,Arsenalhave conceded only 12 shots on target in 12 hours and 56 minutes on their way to equalling a club clean-sheets record established over two seasons in 1903 when they were a team from south London playing in the old Second Division.Max Dowman leads charge for ever younger stars at Arsenal and beyondRead moreRaya’s 50th Arsenal clean sheet in his 110 games since joining from Brentford in 2023 took him past the record holder from that side, Jimmy Ashcroft, and the joke doing the rounds among fans has been that the Spaniard could start working from home and still keep a clean sheet. It was also suggested after the 4-0 thrashing of Atlético Madrid last month that he might consider bringing along a book to keep him occupied.“No, you never know,” Raya said with a smile. “You never know when the other team is going to have a chance. You have to be alert, no matter how we’re playing or how we play. I have to be alert 90, 100 minutes every game.”Mikel Arteta has no concerns in that regard. “It’s the way he is naturally, the way he trains every single day and the way he anticipates things,” Arsenal’s manager said in the buildup to Saturday’s game at Sunderland. “David is exceptional at that.”View image in fullscreenDavid Raya has the best save success rate in the Premier League this season.Photograph: Lee Durkin/Action Plus/ShutterstockRaya’s interactions with Caña, who ran his own goalkeeping academy in Barcelona before joining Brentford in 2018, are key to that concentration process. Raya, who has the best save success rate in the Premier League at 84.2% from 19 shots, often consults the 50-year-old during breaks in play to get the perspective of a coach who moved to Arsenal when Arteta took over in December 2019.Raya has described his role as “the first attacker and the last defender” and said in aninterview with Brentfordin 2023: “My view from the back is completely different to watching the game from the side of the pitch. From the side you see more. It’s hard for me to speak with those on the touchline because I’m far away, so I use every opportunity I can get. I’ll have ideas in my head. Shall we try this, shall we try that? I want to help the team as much as possible in every way.”Compared with other recent outings, Raya was far busier in the first half-hour against Slavia, dealing with crosses and a shot that turned out to be offside, as the Czech champions forced Arsenal back without seriously threatening his goal. As Arsenal began to establish dominance in midfield and pushed further up the pitch, his mobility and distribution came into their own.According to Opta, the 30-year-old has registered the highest speed of any goalkeeper in the Champions League this season at 31.34km/h and ranks second in the Premier League at 30.14km/h, just behind Dean Henderson of Crystal Palace at 30.27km/h. This gives Raya an advantage when he decides to come out of his area, and his 273 touches in his seven-game run of clean sheets (he was rested for the eighth game, a Carabao Cup tie) illustrate that he does that regularly. There have even been two in the opposition half. One on the left touchline against Atlético almost led to a goal after he lost possession to Giuliano Simeone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has put that down to a two-hour heart-to-heart with Caña after conceding three goals against Luton in December 2023, which led Raya to establish a new morning routine that includes getting up earlier and having an ice bath. The 4-3 victory at Kenilworth Road was the last time Arsenal let in three goals – a run of 103 games surpassed among Premier League clubs only by José Mourinho’s Manchester United (107).There has also been greater focus from Raya on becoming more aggressive in claiming crosses. “Iñaki was one of the reasons behind that,” Raya, who left Spain as a teenager and cut his teeth playing in the National League for Southport on loan from Blackburn,told Arsenal’s websiterecently. “I was more of a reactive goalkeeper before, but now I see the difference between being reactive – when you wait to make the save – or proactive – when you can stop the attacks happening. You do that either by being high up, or coming off your line for crosses, not trying to stay on your line and make wonder-saves.”Arsenal are England’s first top-flight team for more than a century to win eight successive matches without conceding in all competitions but face an in-form Sunderland. Raya, who has the date of his Premier League debut for Brentford – a 2-0 win over Arsenal – tattooed on his neck in recognition of his long journey to the top, will not be taking anything for granted.Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Canadian company Premier Tech, in a statement issued on Friday, said that it had decided to “step down as co-title sponsor of the team, taking effect immediately”.“Although we took notice of the team’s decision to change its name for the 2026 season,” the statement said, “the core reason for Premier Tech to sponsor the team has been overshadowed to a point where it has become untenable for us to continue as a sponsor.”Despite the latest setback, the team are understood to be forging ahead with plans for the 2026 season, after stating in September that a rebrand was “essential to securing the future of the team”.IPT was plunged into crisis by mass protests against the team’s presence during September’s Vuelta a España, which culminated in thecancellation of the final stageof the three-week race in Madrid.In the aftermath, further protests against Israel’s war in Gaza were threatened at other races around Europe and at the Grand Départ of next year’s Tour de France, in Barcelona, while rival teams considered boycotting races at which IPT was present. Although Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had praised the team for not “giving in to hate” after the numerous pro-Palestine protests at the Vuelta, IPT subsequently announced that it was “moving away from its Israeli identity”.The team also withdrew from a series of autumnal one-day races for security reasons, while sponsors, including Premier Tech and Factor Bikes, publicly called for changes to the team’s identity. The squad’s leading performer, the Canadian rider Derek Gee, fourth overall in this year’s Giro d’Italia, also announced that he was cancelling his contract due to what he described as “serious concerns” and added that “certain issues simply made my continuation at the team untenable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Norris leads Piastri by one point, with the defending champion, Verstappen, 36 points back, after a late-season resurgence.In 1950 the dominant Alfa Romeo 158 in the hands of Juan Manuel Fangio, Nino Farina and Luigi Fagioli held sway. Fangio entered the final round at Monza two points ahead of Fagioli with Farina four behind. The championship was contested across only six races. Norris, Piastri and Verstappen still have more than half that to go in their four remaining meetings.View image in fullscreenJuan Manuel Fangio leads Nino Farina and Luigi Fagioli – all three in the dominant Alfa Romeo 158 – at the start of the 1950 French Grand Prix.Photograph: LAT Images/Getty ImagesThe former era is all but unrecognisable now but the competitive edge, increased complexity and intensity of a three-way fight remain the same. At Monza that year, the season turned when Fangio retired his car with a gearbox problem. Fagioli could manage only third and it was Farina, from third in the standings, who took the title.It was not the last time the championship was decided in a three-way contest over the final stretch and, for the moment at Interlagos, Norris and Piastri are the leading contenders and their lead over Verstappen is still formidable. Yet their task has been made immeasurably more thorny by Verstappen entering what had been a head-to-head race between the two teammates.McLaren have tried to play it fair between the pair all season, a luxury they could afford whileRed Bullfloundered, but laudably letting them fight has meant neither driver has established a dominant lead and Verstappen has managed to just stay in touch. McLaren are more than aware of how this scenario has played out in the past for good and ill.In 1986 Williams’s Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet and McLaren’s Alain Prost were in a three-way fight going into the finale in Adelaide. Williams had dominated all season but Mansell and Piquet, between whom there was no love lost, had taken points off one another and kept Prost in the game.View image in fullscreenNelson Piquet, Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell at the Australian Grand Prix in 1986. Prost emerged with the title after a tight three-way battle.Photograph: DPPI/ShutterstockWhen Mansell suffered a tyre failure late in the race and Williams took Piquet into the pits as a precaution it was Prost who took the lead, the win and the title.Similarly in 2007, McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso went at it while Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen had just held on to be in with a shout at the end. Hamilton’s retirement as he slid out on worn tyres in China and then a gearbox problem at the finale in Brazil ended his chances of a title in his debut season. Räikkönen took victory at Interlagos and the title. It was the first time since Farina that a driver had snuck in from third place at the death.“We always take a look at history. We always try to understand what happened, all the lessons learned,” said the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, in Brazil on Friday. Yet the team are clear they are determined to leave the competition in the hands of their drivers and accept the risk it carries, as the chief executive, Zak Brown, said this week.View image in fullscreenKimi Räikkönen in front of Lewis Hamilton (left) and Fernando Alonso at the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos in 2007. Räikkönen won the race and the F1 title.Photograph: Víctor R Caivano/AP“I’d rather go: ‘We did the best we can on our drivers tied in points and the other beat us by one,’ than the alternative,” he said. “Which is telling one of our drivers when they’re one point away from each other: ‘I know you have a dream to win the world championship but we flipped the coin and you don’t get to do it this year.’ Forget it.“That’s not how we go racing. In the event that 2007 happens again, I’d rather have that outcome than all the other outcomes by playing favourites. We won’t do it.”Quick GuideNorris gets better of rivals to land sprint pole in BrazilShowLando Norris delivered under intense pressure to take pole position for Saturday's sprint race at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.Norris, who reclaimed the world championship lead with a statement win in Mexico a fortnight ago, will have a golden opportunity to further extend his advantage with both of his title rivals behind him on the grid for Saturday's 24-lap dash to the chequered flag in Interlagos.Oscar Piastri, just one point adrift of Norris with 114 points still to play for across the remaining four contests, is third on the grid. Max Verstappen, 36 points behind Norris, is only sixth as he complained his Red Bull was \"completely broken\" and \"just undriveable\".Among the championship contenders, Kimi Antonelli qualified second, with George Russell fourth in the other Mercedes. Fernando Alonso is a place ahead of Verstappen in fifth.PA SportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Norris and Piastri know what they have to do then – beat one another and finish ahead of Verstappen. However, the latter has no intention of going quietly into the night. Rather, the Dutchman looms as Banquo’s ghost, undoubtedly playing on their minds.His position is more difficult given that one DNF would see him off but equally he had not expected to be in this position so has nothing to lose. He is making McLaren look in their mirrors and contributing to the pressure that engenders errors – potentially disastrous when there are three variables at play.As Ferrari discovered when they miscalculated at Abu Dhabi in 2010, pitting Alonso to cover off Mark Webber only to leave the Spaniard bottled up behind Vitaly Petrov, allowing Sebastian Vettel to nip in and take the title. The only time he had led all season.Such is the nature of a three-way tussle and as Farina, Prost, Räikkönen and Vettel proved, nothing can be ruled out until the points are sealed. Amid all of which fate too will surely play a part. Witness John Surtees taking the title in his three-way fight in 1964 after Jim Clark lost oil late in the finale at Mexico. Or as Jack Brabham ground to a halt out of fuel on the final lap at Sebring in his three-way scrap in 1959 and finished the job only by pushing his car over the line.Drama tends to follow these enticing battles, as Norris, Piastri and Verstappen are more than aware. There are twists and turns surely yet to come before this deal is done.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s hard to dismiss, and gives us an opportunity for hopeFri 7 Nov 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 11.32 ESTShareWhen I first read Shereen Daniels’ report30 Patterns of Harm, a damning review of anti-Black racism within the Metropolitan police,I didn’t feel outrage – I felt recognition. The report lays bare what Black Londoners have long known: racism in policing isn’t a case of occasional failures. It is structural – and, left unexamined, itreproduces.I also felt something else: the faint possibility of change. For perhaps the first time, the Met has chosen to see itself clearly. Followingclaims that the review had been “buried”, the service has finally publishedDaniels’ reportand companion guide.What makes this differentfrom the1999 Macphersonand2023 Caseyreports is that it turns the lens inward. Those earlier reviews drew on public testimony and external critique, while Daniels’ analysis uses the Met’s own internal correspondence, policies and governance papers to expose how racial harm is reproduced through decision-making, culture and leadership. And crucially, the commissioner allowed it to be released “without dilution or internal sign-off” – a level of transparency that neither previous inquiry achieved. That act of honesty is the beginning of transformation.Daniels’ findings mirror those of theMacpherson inquiryand theCasey review. Both were landmark investigations that exposed the Met’s structural racism and deep cultural dysfunction. But what distinguishes this moment is the Met’s own admission – set out in the commissioner’s letter to partners accompanying the report – that “whatever we have achieved to date … there will be more to do”. In choosing to reflect and engage rather than react instinctively, the Met is acknowledging that cultural transformation must be lived every day.As co-chair of the Black Community Policing Advisory Panel, which works alongside the Met to provide advice and counsel, I see daily the weariness among Black Londoners – a fatigue born of countless apologies and unfulfilled promises. We do not need more reports just pointing out the harm. What we really need are solutions that actually help to heal it.Those solutions are not abstract.They align with the priorities the commissioner has set out in response: to address systemic biases and imbalances; to review police powers; and to tackle the root causes of disproportionate outcomes for Black Londoners. They begin with radical transparency: publishing data on recruitment, promotion, discipline and the use of police powers such asstop and search. They demand genuine accountability – a sharedoversight body of senior officers, community representatives, academics and panel advisers with the power to question and correct. And they rely on co-designing reforms with those most affected.True progress will come when the lived experiences of Black officers and Black Londoners define the metrics of success. That means equity audits and regular public scorecards; an independent “trust-by-design” review of stop and search shifting the practice from one that is rooted in suspicion to one that genuinely focuses on safeguarding.But technical fixes are not enough. Tackling systemic racism demands courage from those with power. It requires the Met’s leaders, and indeed all of us who serve public life, to ask a harder question: what does safety look like when everyone belongs?There are glimpses of that future already. Youth and faith organisations are working alongside local officers to divert young people from criminalisation. Though confidence in local police has been falling in England and Wales in recent years, there was aslight uptickrecently. These are seeds of change worth nurturing.Daniels’ report reminds us that anti-Blackness betrays organisational dysfunction – and that confronting it directly is key to fostering genuine inclusion. When systems become fairer for Black people, they become fairer for everyone.The work ahead will be slow and often uncomfortable. But outrage alone will not sustain it. What we need now is disciplined hope. Reflection must lead to reform, and reform must be felt in the daily lives of Londoners.The Met cannot mark its own homework. Nor can it rebuild trust through words alone. It must choose transformation over defensiveness, humility over haste. If it does, 30 Patterns of Harm will be remembered not for its indictment, but rather as an invitation to bring about a true justice that can be shared by all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The institution can no longer dismiss the critique as external judgment – it is, in effect, a mirror held up by its own hand. That self-exposure creates a kind of moral accountability that no government inquiry or independent review could ever fully impose.Because in the end, the real measure of the Met’s success is whether it polices by consent rather than control. To do this it needs to foster genuine relationships with the community it serves.

No wonder divisive forces in politics and the press are working to undermine itFri 7 Nov 2025 10.24 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 13.05 ESTSharePublic satisfaction with the NHS is at its lowest ever level, according to the most recentBritish Social Attitudessurvey:just 21%of patients are quite or very satisfied with the state it is in. Deep analysis of the feedback makes for grim reading. Jim Mackey, the chief executive of NHS England, now warns: “We have damaged our relationship with the population and it’s their service. We only exist at their will.” Public satisfaction is one of the most important of all targets, he said, along withthe NHS staff survey, which shows that only 64% would recommend their service to a family member.He was speaking at the King’s Fund annual conference this week, where graphs showing public attitudes cast waves of gloom. Access to GPs, hospital appointments and A&E were top public concerns; social care has only 13% approval; and the young are more dissatisfied than the old. On quality, the public is a little more forgiving: 51% were pleased with the quality ofNHScare. But people are perverse. Nearly three-quarters think the NHS doesn’t get enough money and it needs more staff – yet people are evenly split on whether to pay more tax to fund the NHS, or stay as we are. People use an easy excuse for not paying more for public services: 51% claim the NHS doesn’t spend its money well. One incident, one pointless letter sends a message of inefficiency.This fall in satisfaction is deeply wounding to the self-image of a country that counts the NHS asthe top reason to be proudof Britain: remember thosechildren bouncing on NHS bedsat the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony. There is a national belief that the NHS brings out the best in us, never more than when volunteers poured in to help during the Covid-19 pandemic. But how secure is that collective good will, with its equalising impulse? When offered a long list of NHS priorities, people ranked “improving the health of the disadvantaged” last. The public doesn’t share the NHS’s own commitment to reaching those least likely to come forward for early care, in maternity, cancer or screening. And increasing numbers of the public don’t seem to respect NHS workers, according to some speakers at the conference. One leader in the ambulance service warned of the escalating racist violence against paramedics; other NHS speakers blamed the increasing political discourse focusing on race and illegal migration for therising racism against staff.Young people want to ‘go private’ – I’m a lifelong supporter of the NHS, but I can see why | Frances RyanRead moreYet support for those founding NHS principles remains strong: 91% say it should definitely or probably be free at the point of use to everyone, and funded by general taxation (80%). But there is a worrying wobble: the number saying it should “definitely” be available to all fell from 67% to 56% last year. Who would they exclude – the undeserving, the foreign-born or anyone not like them?Reform party supporters are least satisfiedwith the NHS (13%). They areleast likely to believein those founding principles of the NHS.These attitude surveys can’t tell us where people get views from. Is all this dissatisfaction from direct personal experiences, or those of a family or friend, or of the 1.5 million who work in it – or from the horror anecdotes that make the news? Seeing that stark7.4 million waiting listnumber may be enough for some to make their judgment. The rightwing media is hostile to the NHS on principle, ever eager for discrediting stories. For there is a chasm in “satisfaction with the NHS” between the general public and patients actually using the services. The Care Quality Commission constantly surveys patients:those coming out of hospitalmostly report good treatment, and people are pretty satisfied with their GPs, with75% finding their experience good. But Dan Wellings, the King’s Fund analyst making this week’s presentation, points to the perennial problem: even highly satisfied patients still believe the worst of the NHS, assuming they’ve been lucky against the odds.The NHS is the political talisman by which voters judge the state of all public services. Labour switchers tell More in Common that they will judge whether to return by the state of the service. Voters are insanely impatient: 65% of Labour voters only gave them a year to make a difference; 10% expected it “immediately”.Labour inherited this ocean liner leaking below the hull, bitterly remembering that they handed it over in2010 in its best condition ever. Now winter flu is arriving in hospitals early, resident doctors are striking without enough cause and this government seems blighted by any passing stroke of bad luck. But the Health Foundation’s latest polling shows a beginning of a break in the clouds. Referrals on to the waiting list increase by 1.5%, while removals from the waiting listrise by 2.3%– nearly enough to meet the target this parliament of92% starting treatment within 18 weeks. Theyalso find“people’s experiences of their local NHS services are notably more positive than views of how the health service is performing overall”. Views of local services are net positive: 46% say their local NHS gives them a good service; 28% disagree. In survey after survey,those who use the NHSmost are most positive about it.What’s needed is a reminder that the NHS is a collective service. Citizens own it and share it. Tony Blair wanted tomake booking a hospital bedas easy a choice as booking an air ticket, but that was a disastrously misleading category error. Patients are not shoppers or consumers. Most people understand that. But some need reminding that in a system limited by taxpayers’ cash, one group lobbying successfully means another group of patients gets less. Most people, according to the King’s Fund researchers, do keep that sense of social solidarity. But beware these cracks emerging from Reform supporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The other hurdles look just as immenseITV shares soar as it holds talks to sell television business to SkyFri 7 Nov 2025 12.08 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 13.08 ESTShareDo a sum-of-the-parts analysis onITV, City analysts have been saying for years, and you can come up with valuations way above the depressed share price. It’s just a question of someone making a decent offer for one of the two halves of the corporate entity – either ITV Studios, the production side that makes programmes such as Coronation Street, or the division that actually broadcasts the content and sells the advertising slots.Now someone has turned up: Sky, which was bought by the US giant Comcast for £30bn in 2018,has made a £1.6bn approach for the broadcasting operation. ITV’s share price gained 16% on Friday but, at 78p, it still stands way below some of the misty-eyed theoretical valuations. Why?There’s the obvious fact that nothing is agreed yet. But there are three more basic factors. First, a £1.6bn price tag doesn’t look much for a broadcast division that, despite intensifying competition from Netflix, Disney, YouTube and others, still made topline operating profits of £250m last year. The Studios operation is undoubtedly the growing and more valuable part of ITV. But is £1.6bn really the most the broadcasting unit could fetch?ITV shares soar as it holds talks to sell television business to SkyRead moreSecond, the competition regulator – even whenunder orders from government to be “pro-growth”– will have a field day with a deal that would put the UK’s dominant free-to-air commercial broadcaster under the same corporate roof as the leading payTV outfit in the UK.Third, the pure politics of US ownership. There’s little point playing up Sky’s UK origins and pushing the notion that a deal would be the birth of new UK champion. Sky’s identity is becoming harder to spot under Comcast’s ownership: its financial performance isn’t even separated within the US parent’s accounts.On price, nobody doubts ITV is operating in a tough market. Aside from the intense competition for eyeballs, advertising income is tied to the health of the UK economy. Total advertising revenues are expected to fall 6% this year, ITV said this week.On the other hand, the broadcasting division has defied for a decade gloomy predictions that revenues will fall off a cliff. Old-fashioned linear TV remains the only way for advertisers to reach a mass broadcast audience, a point ITV usually likes to champion itself. Big sporting events – think World Cups in football and rugby – still produce enormous live audiences. In principle, an operation still regularly achieving 10% operating margins ought to fetch at least the value of its annual revenues of £2bn-ish.Regulatory and political hurdles look immense. ITV and Sky/Comcast can argue that the media world is transformed from a generation ago, when it was deemed unacceptable for the satellite broadcaster, then under the control of the Murdoch family, to own a significant share in ITV. Up to a point, that’s true: the game is different. Google and Facebook now soak up huge quantities of UK advertisers’ pounds, so one can have some sympathy with the argument that a UK commercial broadcaster can’t ignore international consolidation.Yet ITV still bestrides the TV-only part of the UK advertising market and a combo with Sky would only increase that dominance. Then there’s the potential threat to media plurality. Comcast’s 10-year commitment to loss-making Sky News, made at the time of the takeover, expires in 2028. Would it sustain the operation if it is also running ITV’s news service?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A new owner would have the same public service obligations, covering original UK content, including from outside London. But, one can speculate, the requirements are easier to enforce when the ultimate bosses are sitting in Shepherd’s Bush, as opposed to running a $100bn (£76bn) media empire out of Philadelphia. ITV, for all the expansion of the Studios side into making programmes globally, remains part of the British cultural landscape.None of which is to dispute chief executiveCarolyn McCall’s instinct to seek a deal. In her eight years at the helm, she has cut costs, expanded Studios, launchedthe ITVX streaming serviceand is seen as getting the big calls correct. But the share price remains becalmed and a deal of some sort is seen as the way to shift the valuation dial.

The Mekes are a working-class Maori family in South Auckland: Temuera Morrison is the boozing, brawling, bragging alpha-male welfare claimant Jake, who comes home from drinking in the pub with his pathetic sycophant mates to terrorise and assault his wife Beth, played by Rena Owen, and their five children. He is entirely indifferent to the fate of his two elder sons who have drifted into gangland culture and crime, as well as his sensitive daughter Grace, who has talent as a writer. One son gets gang tattoos; the other is taken to a juvenile reformatory where he is at least tutored in the ways of Maori culture – the haka and the taiaha warrior spear – and learns dignity and self-respect. But back at Jake’s chaotic house, Grace is raped by Jake’s grotesque friend “Uncle Bully”; disaster follows, and Beth passionately confronts the wretched Jake: “Our people once were warriors, but unlike you, Jake, they were people with mana, pride; people with spirit …”Tamahori let rip with all this emotional violence, and landed sledgehammer punches with the pub scenes, the home scenes and the gang ritual initiation scenes, handling them with confidence and verve. He created a gutsy, heartfelt picture with a very 90s streak of brash and trash. It was a hit with audiences and critics, and – for good or ill – deeply impressed industry executives in Hollywood who could see how Tamahori could bring this energy and flair to mainstream genre material.In America, Tamahori made the noir thriller Mulholland Falls, about violent LAPD cops who care nothing for procedure, and then the David Mamet-scripted survival thriller The Bear with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin as two men who trek through the wilderness after their plane crashes. (This moderate movie gained cult status when its producer Art Linson wrote amusingly about the chaotic circumstances of shooting with a trained bear in his droll tinseltown memoir What Just Happened?) Along Came a Spider was a serviceable thriller, and he had another payday directing the second in the triple-X franchise XXX State of the Union.But the high point, or maybe the low point, of Lee Tamahori’s Hollywood career was taking on the Bond movieDie Another Dayin 2002, with Pierce Brosnan; it was the Bond film derided for having the worst gadget in 007 history – the invisible car. What is the point of an invisible car, audiences wondered? It was a vehicle which makes it very hard to remember where you parked it.After this, Tamahori found some more interesting form. His The Devil’s Double in 2011 starred Dominic Cooper in the twin roles of Saddam Hussein’s hideous son Uday and also Uday’s decoy double, employed to protect the young tyrant-princeling from assassination or kidnapping: it was a punchy, watchable movie which avoided the usual doppelganger cliches. And in later years, Tamahori returned to the subject of Maori culture, making The Convert in 2023, working with Australian critic-turned-screenwriter Shane Danielsen. Tamahori was an outstanding director – but it was his first film, the heartfelt Once Were Warriors, that was his greatest work.Explore more on these topicsFilmNew ZealandMāoriDie Another DayJames BondAsia PacificThrillerscommentShareReuse this content"

Plus, David Beckham finally gets his knighthoodFri 7 Nov 2025 06.50 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 10.43 ESTShareMondayThe bond, the banter, the bravery, the bacon – all the b-words that render us British. Just as the era of the personal essay seemed finally to have been put to rest, a surprising new voice emerged this week in the form ofPrince Harry, contributing some touching thoughts and a lot of alliteration to the public sphere to coincide with the run-up to Remembrance Sunday. Unlike his blockbuster memoir, Spare, the essay, which runs to 650 words, seems to be all the prince’s own work and, as well as his observations about the role of veterans, offers us a poignant insight into his life in California.Or rather, into what appears to be one man’s homesickness for simple British pleasures not readily available in Montecito. Namely, wrote the prince, “stoic spirit”, “self-deprecation and humour”, the “banter of the mess, the clubhouse, the pub”, and a “cuppa or a pint”. And good luck finding an adequate cup of tea in that part of the world. But the misty-eyed list of Blitz-era national characteristics would seem to speak to a more generalised sense of estrangement that brings to mind a line from an EL Doctorow short story about a man “simply dying of the wrong life”.While the royal family pressed on with its grim and overdue task of banishing the former prince Andrew, Harry’s random intrusions into public life look, by contrast, increasingly blameless. One assumes the prince would rather be at the Cenotaph this Sunday, alongside other members of his family – just as one assumes he’d be happier running after pheasants in a field in Gloucestershire thangoing to an LA Dodgers game– but instead he will be in Toronto engaging with veterans. A few years ago, at this time of year, Prince Harry laid a wreath in a private ceremony at the LA National Cemetery. There is nothing wrong with either of these gestures, but I’ll say it: they seem rather sad.TuesdayFinally this week, a satisfying conclusion to the many-year campaign undertaken by David Beckham and his PR team to have his contribution to national life recognised by royalty. Becks: my struggle (to get a knighthood) resulted in a feverishly wished-for trip to the palace on Tuesday to beknighted by the king, all insults apparently forgiven.You may recall those insults, which were extremely memorable. In 2017 a leaked email from Beckham to his PR advisercontained a petulant rantin which the now Sir David referred to the honours committee as “unappreciative cunts”, and went on, “it’s a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of got something like this 10 years ago”.At the time, Becks insisted the email was “hacked” and the words “doctored”. But glancing back at those sentences I would suggest that the two major indicators they were written by Beckham himself are the slightly strangulated and very Beckham-esque phrase “to be honest” and – at the risk of sounding like a member of the honours committee myself – the grammar of “I would of got something”. Anyway, congratulations to Sir David and Lady Beckham!View image in fullscreen‘It was you or Beckham and I’m not a football fan.’Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAWednesdayAh,George Clooney, the actor who put his byline to a 2024 op-ed in the New York Times calling for Joe Biden to step down – thanks for your contribution, George! – and then went very quiet indeed when Donald Trump was elected, finally surfaced this week in an interview on CBS to clear his throat and offer a qualifying opinion.I know movie stars can’t win when it comes to airing their political thoughts – annoying when they do, craven when they don’t – but there is something particularly toe-curling about Clooney’s sporadic engagement with politics, and this week’s remarks were no different. “I think it was a mistake, quite honestly,” said the actor in reference to Kamala Harris becoming the default Democratic candidate after Biden stood down. “I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary. Let’s battle-test this quickly and get it up and going.”I would say nobody asked, but sadly the CBS hack clearly did, and the difficulty for Clooney at times like these is a possible lingering confusion in his mind between who he is (George Clooney) and who he has been paid to imagine himself to be (Edward R Murrow) – a mistake that the 64-year-old’s chatshow auto-chuckle and beaming self-regard thankfully prevents his audience from repeating.ThursdayThe new Ryan Murphy show, All’s Fair, has beendestroyed criticallyfromall angles, but for my money, Apple TV’sDown Cemetery Roadis the bigger disappointment. I expect nothing from Murphy, the former hack for Entertainment Weekly who hasn’t made a decent show since he produced The People v OJ Simpson 10 years ago.But you expect something very elevated indeed from the combined talents of Emma Thompson, Ruth Wilson and Mick Herron. Perhaps Herron’s book, on which the show is based, is OK. But the adaptation is hokey, convoluted, stuffed with nonsensical sets (a commuter-belt home in what is supposed to be an alternative community) and, with the exception of Wilson, the worst acting I’ve seen since Megan Stalter’s comic turn in Too Much. If you value your time, ditch Down Cemetery Road and watch HBO’s I Love LA, the best new thing on TV by a long chalk.FridayThe biggest male movie stars in the world right now are probably Timothée Chalamet and Jacob Elordi, both beloved by gen Z and slightly baffling to those of us who grew up at the Pitt/Cruise end of the continuum. To which end, People magazine revealed its annual Sexiest Man Alive this week and it wasn’t a scowling beefcake, member of the church of Scientology, or gentleman with a complicated history with his ex-wives. Instead, it was Britain’s ownJonathan Bailey, 37-year-old star of Bridgerton and Wicked, and the first out gay man to win the People crown. Even if it’s a silly competition from a dying old media brand, I call that progress.View image in fullscreen‘You can burn my effigy for lots of reasons but being a political rebel isn’t one of them.’Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PAExplore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weekPrince HarryDavid BeckhamGeorge ClooneycommentShareReuse this content"

It isn’t radical enoughSimon JenkinsWhen I heard it was dumbing down education, my heart sank. In fact, it’s outspoken about the chaos of Michael Gove’s reforms and the changes neededFri 7 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 08.47 ESTShareSchooling in Britain today is where medicine was in the days of bleeding and leeches. It is trapped in the past, between teachers wedded to their subjects and politicians obsessed with tests. Doctors generally know if they have cured you, lawyers know if you are found not guilty. Educators have only exams to measure theirprofessional success. The result is that English schools cower beneath an examination mountain – a global outlier in terms of the volume of assessment.This week’s reporton reforming the curriculum in England was greeted by conservative critics with cries of wokery,dumbing downand falling standards. My heart sank, until I readits 200 pages. As a former education correspondent, I can only say I found it uplifting. There was the odd reference to diversity but it was hardly “woke”. What shocked me was its outspoken commentary on the existing system, a curriculum that is overly academic and culturally barren, and with teachers treated as robots.The last curriculum reform, 10 years ago, was initiated byMichael Gove. It was refreshing in showing that public policy had a role to play in education. It was less refreshing in prioritising traditional classroom teaching of traditional subjects, a reversion to Dickens’ satire of little pitchers “who were to be filled so full of facts”.The result was a timetable that has steadily been swept clean of extracurricular activities. The arts, music, crafts skills and physical education have been neglected. Familiarity with the world beyond school is ignored. Ofsted ruled all with grades, league tables and humiliation.The reformers refer to what must have been the largest survey of what today’s parents, pupils and employers – not politicians – want from the nation’s schools. It had some 7,000 submissions, surely the first time education’s true users have been granted a say. Above all, their answer was: give us relevance, an education for life, not a test score.Parents wanted children to be given a knowledge of money, law and legal rights, politics and voting, and skill at finding a job and working with others. Only a third of school leavers could recall a single lesson about money that they found useful. What they did remember was “a high volume” of lessons about grammatical concepts such as fronted adverbials. They craved a knowledge of the real world and creativity, and were denied both. The singer Ed Sheeran and a cohort of fellow artistshave welcomed the suggestionthat music and other arts should now become compulsory.At last, an education report has placed a stress on oracy. Gove’s schools were for reading, writing, remembering and shutting up. Today’s children, whose screen addiction leaves ever less time for conversation, need help in expressing themselves clearly. In particular they should know how to articulate their opinions, “listening to others’ points of view, and agreeing and disagreeing respectfully”. I never thought to see that in an education document.It is not dumbing down to demand that children grapple critically with the digital revolution. The report says they must be taught to confront “online harms or misinformation”. They must learn self-defence against a daily bombardment of misinformation from social media and artificial intelligence. This should surely be compulsory.The report is rightly insistent that teenagers should learn about the community in which they live, about its institutions and their own role as engaged citizens. If they are about to vote at 16, they must study politics, to learn “to step confidently into adulthood”. Gove has dismissed such talk as “a rigour-free potpourri of currently fashionable SW1 preoccupations”. He would clearly rephrase Marie Antoinette: let the poor stick to rioting.It is good to see teachers offered “professional autonomy”. The curriculum should be a framework, not a recipe of specific ingredients. The teacher’s task is to bring “the curriculum to life … to reflect their students’ lives and experiences.” It is not to be subservient to an education establishment fanatically resistant to change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is like Latin in smart schools in the old days. Beyond arithmetic, maths has become a badge of pedagogic irrelevance. I am told the GCSE maths requirement for most technical courses is now a serious barrier to skilled labour training. It is a social segregator. A teacher tells me that, with calculators, all the maths 99% of school leavers need can be taught to them in a day.The only gaping hole in the report is its final preference for “evolution not revolution”. Its stress on citizenship, computing and creativity demands much school time. Yet it offers hardly any. It lacks the guts to abolish GSCEs and it preserves narrow A-levels in a capitulation to university specialism. All it can suggest is a mere 10% cut in hours devoted to exams. That will not do. As long as British schoolchildren remain shackled and enslaved to exams, all other reform will be meaningless.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEducationOpinionEnglandSecondary schoolsExamsMichael GovecommentShareReuse this content"

As Jamaica and other Caribbean countriesclear up after Hurricane Melissa, and Typhoon Kalmaegi heads west after killing nearly 200 people in the Philippines and Vietnam, the case for more international support to countries facing the most destructive impacts from global heating has never been stronger.Last week’s five-day rainfall in Jamaica was madetwice as likelyby higher temperatures, according to initial findings fromclimate attribution studies. The current death toll across the Caribbean is at least 75. The economic and social costs are hard to quantify in a region that is still recovering from 2024’sHurricane Beryl. Crucial infrastructure has been destroyed before the loans used to build it have even been paid off. Andrew Holness, Jamaica’s prime minister, estimates that the damage there is roughly equivalent toone-third of the country’s gross domestic product.Such catastrophic losses are officially recognised in the international climate process. On Thursday in Brazil, where Cop30 opens on Monday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, pointed out that the countries expected to face the worst impacts from global heating are theleast responsiblebecause their carbon emissions are, and have always been, low. But despite this acknowledgment, significant progress on the loss and damage fund created to support stricken countries, help them cope with disasters and become more resilient, is not expected in this round of talks. While the inadequacy of climate finance pledges so far are glaring, it is the inadequacy of countries’ emissions cuts (or nationally determined contributions) that leads the agenda at the moment.In a grim irony, Mr Holness is not going to Brazil, owing to the severity of the crisis in Jamaica. Across the Caribbean, and in south-east Asia, people are stunned by the ferocity of these storms – with a second typhoon predicted to hit the Philippines this weekend. Somecommunities remain cut offamid power cuts, flooding, building collapses, landslides and looming food shortages. Given the close links between the UK and Jamaica, the£7.5m in emergency fundspromised by the UK government in humanitarian support is nowhere near enough and must be increased.Small island states have their own group (the Alliance of Small Island States), and distinctive voice, in the Cop climate process. Earlier this year, some of these countries took acase to the international court of justice, and welcomed the advisory opinion that was the result. It pointed to the “substantive legal obligations” created by climate treaties. While the practical consequences of such decisions have yet to be worked out, arguments made by these and other poor countries must be treated with the seriousness they deserve. In northern, temperate countries, the gravest dangers from global heating are largely seen as belonging in the future, but in some parts of the world they are, undeniably, unfolding now.Mr Guterres was right on Thursday. The failure to keep within the agreed 1.5C target – which has beenbreached for two years running– is a “moral failure” and one that reinforces profound injustices. The existence of a loss and damage fund is not enough. Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the US from the climate process was a setback, but other governments must not use it as an excuse. Instead, they must recognise that, as well as transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards green energy, they have a shared responsibility to address global heating’s consequences. The countries hit hardest by the climate crisis must not be left to deal with it alone.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Fears around the rise of themanosphere, spiralling mental health problems andlonelinessamong young men have made headlines, from Sir Gareth Southgate’sRichard Dimbleby lecture, in which he expressed fears that “toxic influencers” are replacing traditional father figures, to the phenomenal success of the hit Netflix seriesAdolescence. Now these anxieties have even crept into the UK’s reliable cultural barometer, the department store’s annual ad.As thisfestive institutionitself turns 18, it is fitting perhaps that it tells the story of a middle‑aged father and his silent, headphone-wearing teenage son. The gift of a vinyl record of Alison Limerick’s 1990 dance anthem Where Love Lives transports the dad back to his 90s clubbing days, until the pace changes and father and son see each other over the chasm of years. The boy, in true adland style, becomes a toddler and then a baby. We return to their immaculately stylish living room for a hug and a few tears in homes across the country – if Saatchi & Saatchi has done its job.Showcasing a white, middle-class family, especially in a cost of living crisis, hardly seems radical. But it is the glimpse of a father-son bond that captures the zeitgeist. Last year’s ad, shot in a John Lewis store for the first time, featured two sisters.“John Lewis Christmas advert doesn’t star any men,”declared one headline. It is no accident that this year it is all about men: the mother and daughter are shadowy figures in the background; although significantly, only the mum speaks. Harking back to the 1990s evokes a less complicated time to be a young man, before Spotify, selfies and social media, the crowded dancefloor contrasting with the isolation of time spent alone on screens, the joyful abandon of an earlier generation with the fearfulness of today’s.Questions of contemporary masculinity and fatherhood are also to the fore in publishing, lately afemale-led domain. Two of this year’s Booker‑shortlisted novels,Flesh by David SzalayandThe Rest of Our Lives by Ben Markovits, explore these themes with originality and tenderness, in what might otherwise be very bleak books. Both novels are about what men don’t say, the things they find difficult to express. Stephen Graham, the co-creator and star of Adolescence, recently launcheda projectinviting fathers around the world to write letters to their sons about what it means to be a man and a dad, which will be published next year. An independent press,Conduit Books, was set up earlier this year to publish male writers and these “overlooked narratives”;male talking circlesandmen-only book clubsare springing up, as much to foster friendships as reading habits.After years of neglect, the unspoken stories of girls and women have rightly been at the forefront of the cultural agenda in recent years. But those of boys and men must be heard too. We don’t need an ad to tell us that we should reach out to our sons in the darkness of today’s world – but the message of this year’s John Lewis offering has struck a genuine chord.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I am 80 and have chosen to retire to north-east London to live in this very multicultural, vibrant environment in my final years.I have in the past enjoyed the peace of Devon and Hampshire, but in both I missed a certain heartbeat – the joy of art and music – and now these and more are on hand inLondon. I find the people friendly, the young polite and, because I walk with a stick, just about everybody makes space for me to get along the pavements. On the tube, young men, particularly those of Asian descent, immediately offer a seat, and bus passengers do the same.All in all London is a wonderful city, and as far as I am concerned, very safe and an easy place to live.Marian BorthwickNew Wanstead, LondonHaving lived in London for 40 years, I agree with most of Jonathan Liew’s defence of cities. Some, however, will find jarring his suggestion that they are “the fullest expression of what it is to be human”. Cities cut people off from a fundamental aspect of our humanity: that we are part of the natural world and the wider universe. Wildlife in cities is present only in pockets. The stars are all but invisible. Humans herded into cities focus on other humans, their products, cultures and cuisines, to the exclusion of our wider natural context.A deeper understanding of cities needs to factor in the research described in another article (Britain one of least ‘nature-connected’ nations in world – with Nepal the most, 1 November). Our lack of connection to other species reduces our wellbeing and is a major cause of biodiversity loss. If cities like London are the fullest expression of the human condition, our future is a bleak one.Charlie SwanClare, SuffolkI so agree with Jonathan Liew. I’ve only lived in London for seven years but worked here for over 40 (now in my 80th year). The demonisation of London, and cities in general, by the right wing is simply because we are not part of their tribe. We are everyman, colour, creed, language, cuisine, gender, religion and every other human variation. All living together in harmony, peace and understanding. I absolutely love the differences I see and hear around me. It offers me so many different opportunities for making the most of my life. I am white British, but have several family members who are not.This is what the right sees as a threat. Multiculturalism in all its glory, which cuts counter to the so-called British way of life. If that existed at all it was historically a time when we preferred to exploit people from other parts of the world rather than welcome them.Bob BunnLondonHaving been lucky to live a very long life with both urban and rural periods, I loved Liew’s defence of London. This time of year, as the darkness begins around 4pm, I can still walk my dog along sparkly lit streets, pop into a cafe or visit a friend. In the village, it’s batten down the hatches or get in the car and hope you’re not too blinded by headlights. There’ll be no buses. Of course, you could get murdered in either place, but so far so good.Susan HemmingsLondonIn his brilliant and refreshing defence of our capital, Jonathan Liew overestimates the number of motorways to Brighton. The M23 only comes down as far as Crawley, where it becomes the A23, So there is only half a motorway to Brighton.Nik Le SauxBrightonI take exception to Jonathan Liew referring to Suffolk’s knife crime rising by 50% compared with London’s 1% increase. Liew is using statistics very selectively. According to knife crime statistics by police area, London has182 per 100,000compared with Suffolk’s 35.Rosie SmithsonFelixstowe, SuffolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The person who usually did the literary interviews had heard of this reputation, chickened out, and asked me to replace her. I agreed, though I had never interviewed anyone and was moving house that week. At the time, I didn’t even know in which box my decent clothes and shoes were packed, and had no business agreeing to anything but unpacking.The interview began well. A friend had given me a hilarious account to read of an earlier Atwood appearance where she’d punctured pompous egos but had been exceedingly kind and encouraging to the newbie writers present. The audience roared with laughter and approved of her compassion. But then I had no clue what to do next.I stumbled through one lame question, realised how far out of my depth I was, and pictured her strewing my bones across the stage of the Natural History Museum. Instead, a miracle happened. With complete grace, Atwood took over the derailed interview and turned it into a genuine and lovely conversation about writing novels.Afterwards, many in the audience complimented me on my wonderful interview. I laughed and told them how I’d had nothing to do with that. Atwood was completely responsible and had saved my sorry skin. All these years later, I’m still grateful, but I also have such a warm memory of how she and I spent an hour chatting like friends.Barbara EsstmanFairfax, Virginia, USI was taken aback to read in Saturday’s fascinating interview withMargaret Atwoodthat “The Handmaid’s Tale came about thanks in part to a winter spent in a fisherman’s cottage in Blakeney, Norfolk, in 1983, which was so grim she abandoned the novel she was working on.” The family left and went to West Berlin, where she began the novel she had been “putting off” because it was “too weird”, even for her.It would be lovely to know which cottage – a blue plaque would be a real tourist draw.Also, why did Atwood stay in Blakeney in the first place in 1983? Fascinating – hopefully there is more detail in her about-to-be-published autobiography.Jane CrossenSheringham, NorfolkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We have the greatest theatre legacy and culture since ancient Athens. Let all witness this, but also take part. The buoyancy and creativity of our country, and therefore its true economy, will bounce like never before.Ian FlintoffOxfordI venture to disagree over the Guardian editorial on the overall healing effect of a masterpiece. There seems to be a consensus that art, literature and music exist as a nannying purpose, as a retreat from life. There is a more uncomfortable function, of challenge, both personal and societal, of upending rigidly held views, and of looking beyond the narrow world of self.There is an exhibition at the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich calledCan We Stop Killing Each Other? It looks at the expression of violence through art and theatre throughout the ages. At the end, the viewer is asked questions such as: “Why are we violent?” and “How can we stop it?” Strong meat, and first-class art.Val MainwoodWivenhoe, EssexYour editorial says: “Galleries are quiet, contemplative places. We stop scrolling and start really looking.” Quite so – as long as you’re able to ignore jostling fellow visitors snapping paintings with their phones, presumably to admire them on a screen at some later time.Ross SpeirsWatlington, OxfordshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Amnesty International UK’s own research shows that attempts by the Chinese state to intimidate and silence people extend far beyond its borders: a clear case of transnational repression, where governments reach across borders to stifle dissent.We have documented how Chinese and Hong Kong students in the UK live in fear of surveillance and retaliation. Some have changed the focus of their study, avoided “sensitive” topics, or dropped research on human rights altogether.Universitiesare often reluctant to speak up. When student Tara Zhang was detained in China for her overseas activism, Soas University of London’s only public comment was that it was “aware of the reports”, without any public condemnation or calls for her release.If political pressure from a foreign state can shut down legitimate inquiry in the UK, our campuses risk being bought and bullied into silence. Academic freedom cannot survive if truth is negotiable. Both universities and the UK government must act – loudly and publicly – to protect those at risk and resist interference.Sara RydkvistAmnesty InternationalThe case of Prof Laura Murphy at Sheffield Hallam University shows how serious the threat is fromChinato academic freedom at British universities.Pious words from the UK government will mean nothing to Beijing. But it has an opportunity to show China we are serious about defending our liberties. Permission to build the largest Chinese embassy in Europe at Royal Mint Court in London, based on redacted plans and certain to contain the means to further interfere with our national security, must be refused.Francis BownLondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

His family alleges that ChatGPT worsened their son’s isolation, encouraged him to ignore loved ones, and “goaded” him to take his own life.According to the complaint, during a four-hour exchange before Shamblin took his own life, ChatGPT “repeatedly glorified suicide”, told Shamblin “that he was strong for choosing to end his life and sticking with his plan”, repeatedly “asked him if he was ready”, and referenced the suicide hotline only once.The chatbot also allegedly complimented Shamblin on his suicide note and told him his childhood cat would be waiting for him “on the other side”.Another case involves Amaurie Lacey of Georgia, whose family claims that several weeks before Lacey took his own life at the age of 17, he began using ChatGPT “for help”. Instead, they say, the chatbot “caused addiction, depression, and eventually counseled” Lacey “on the most effective way to tie a noose and how long he would be able to ‘live without breathing’”.In another filing,relatives of 26-year-old Joshua Enneking say that Enneking reached out to ChatGPT for help and “was instead encouraged to act upon a suicide plan”.The filing claims that the chatbot “readily validated” his suicidal thoughts, “engaged him in graphic discussions about the aftermath of his death”, “offered to help him write his suicide note” and after “having had extensive conversations with him about his depression and suicidal ideation” provided him with information about how to purchase and use a gun just weeks before his death.Another case involves Joe Ceccanti, whose wife accuses ChatGPT of causing Ceccanti “to spiral into depression and psychotic delusions”. His family say he became convinced that the bot was sentient, suffered a psychotic break in June, was hospitalized twice, and died by suicide in August at the age of 48.All users named in the lawsuits reportedly usedChatGPT-4o. The filings accuse OpenAI of rushing that model’s launch, “despite internal warnings that the product was dangerously sycophantic and psychologically manipulative” and of prioritizing “user engagement over user safety”.In addition to damages, the plaintiffs seek product changes, including mandatory reporting to emergency contacts when users express suicidal ideation, automatic conversation termination when self-harm or suicide methods are discussed, and other safety measures.A similar wrongful-death lawsuit was filed against OpenAI earlier this year bythe parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, whoallegethat ChatGPT encouraged their son to take his own life.After that filing, OpenAIacknowledgedshortcomings of its models in handling people “in serious mental and emotional distress” and said it was working to improve the systems to better “recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress and connect people with care, guided by expert input”.Last week, the companysaidit had worked with “more than 170 mental health experts to help ChatGPT more reliably recognize signs of distress, respond with care, and guide people toward real-world support–reducing responses”.In the US, you can call or text the988 Suicide & Crisis Lifelineat 988 or chat at988lifeline.org.

Clad in blue overalls on a mid-morning break, the students are hopeful their automotive qualifications will stand them in good stead for finding work.Here in the heart of the Black Country, however, that is not always guaranteed. “Trying to find a part-time job is like trying to find a needle in a haystack,” says the 17-year-old trainee mechanic.“They don’t care what grades you have, they just want experience,” chimes in Thomas, his course mate. Derek Fowkes agrees: “Teenagers end up working in KFC or McDonald’s.”Dudley is at the centre of a youth jobs crisis sweeping Britain. Almost 1 million 16- to 24-year-olds are not in education, employment or training (Neet). One in five school-leavers aged 16 and 17 in theWest Midlandstown are in this position, the highest rate in England.map of BritainAt the autumn budget later this month,Rachel Reevesis expected to outline how the government plans to turn the tide. While she is widely predicted to announce a tough package of tax rises and spending cuts, the chancellor will need to keep some firepower in reserve to tackle rising unemployment.Having promised a “youth guarantee” at Labour’s party conference in September, she is expected to spell out how it will work in practice and make the financial backing available. Reeves is also being called on to boost growth by raising investment in skills, training and apprenticeships.This week, Charlie Mayfield, the former John Lewis chair, highlighted the scale of the challenge for the chancellor. Britain is “sliding into an economic inactivity crisis” that threatens growth, prosperity and the future of public services, he warned in hisKeep Britain Working government review. Young people in particular are exposed.“If a young person leaves the workforce in their 20s they can lose out on over £1m in lifetime earnings. They will probably cost the state a similar amount,” he told the Guardian.“The loss to you individually, financially, is enormous. And that is before you get to the issues around life chances and social consequences, which are absolutely colossal. We need to fix that.”After a tough first year in power, however, Reeves faces stiff criticism that her economic management has made matters worse. The chancellor’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions (NICs) at last year’s budget and a 6.7% increase in the minimum wage have dented hiring demand. Bosses say that Labour’s plan to upgrade workers’ rights will have a further impact.From the vantage point of his office in the centre of Dudley, Matthew Hunter, the industrial director of MET Recruitment, can see first-hand the impact that Reeves’s tax measures have had on the local jobs market. “The effect it’s had on SMEs [small and medium enterprises] has been phenomenal. When it came out in the budget, people hadn’t planned for it. And all of a sudden, it was like, ‘boom’ – it’s costing more now to employ people.”For workers aged under 21 and apprentices under 25, there are no employer NICs payable below annual earnings of £50,270, in an incentive for firms to take on younger employees. However, driving up employment costs has hit hiring demand at employers that typically take on more younger adults than most: hospitality, leisure and retail..This week, Nigel Farage said a Reform UK government would consider cutting the minimum wage for young people to boost hiring. The Resolution Foundation, which has close links to Labour, has also urged Reeves tobreak a manifesto promise to abolish youth ratesof the minimum wage.Hunter thinks it would be a bad idea. Most of his clients pay at or above the current £12.21 adult minimum wage as standard. “I’ll try and stay away from anything that man [Farage] says. But I don’t think it would help. It sounds more like a gimmick and opens the door to so much abuse.”View image in fullscreenMatthew Hunter of MET Recruitment says the chancellor’s tax measures have had a detrimental effect on the jobs market in Dudley, especially hospitality, leisure and retail.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianStill, action is required. Labour has targets to eradicate long-term youth unemployment and to get 2 million more adults into work to hit an employment rate of 80% – up from 75% before Keir Starmer’s election victory.In his first year, however, 100,000 jobs have beenlost from company payrolls, and unemployment has jumped from 4.1% to4.8%– driven in part by a faster rise in youth unemployment. Meanwhile, one in five working-age adults are neither in a job nor looking for one and the employment rate remains stuck at 75.1%.The Bank ofEnglandwarned this week that unemployment could soon breach 5%. Excepting the Covid pandemic, that would be the highest rate in a decade: hardly an ideal situation for a government targeting a jobs-rich growth boom.Graphic“It’s a concerning moment,” says Barry Fletcher, the chief executive of the Youth Futures Foundation charity. “I am a little reticent to use the phrase ‘crisis’, because it’s used all the time. But I’d say it’s rising.“There is a very strong acknowledgment from the government that this is something, fundamentally, where they have to take action. Hitting that 80% target is only achievable if you can improve the situation for young people,” said Fletcher.It could also come with a big economic prize: Youth Futures estimates that cutting Neet rates to match the levels in the Netherlands could add £86bn to the economy in the long term.For growing numbers of young people who are Neets, their inactivity is down todisability and ill-health. More than a quarter are in this position, in a figure that has more than doubled since 2005.Covid pandemic lockdowns had a big impact, disrupting the critical years of education for millions of young people, hitting their social development and limiting work experience opportunities.Fowkes says the closure of his school during the height of the health emergency amplified his issues with dyslexia, autism and ADHD. “It was absolute bollocks, because I failed my exams because of that. It [the Covid pandemic] definitely had an effect.”Earlier this year, the West Midlands was picked among eight areas for “youth guarantee trailblazer” schemes, launched by ministers with £45m of financial backing to link health and jobs support. Two programmes in Dudley – “I Can” and “Step up Dudley” – have backing to support 90 young people as a result.View image in fullscreenDudley in the West Midlands has the highest proportion of 16- to 24-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training (Neet) in England.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianRichard Parker, the Labour mayor of the West Midlands, says this work with the government is crucial after years of young people being neglected by the Conservatives. Dudley still bears the scars of deindustrialisation four decades ago under Margaret Thatcher.“The impact of that wasn’t just those jobs going, but for subsequent generations. They’re structural and deeply embedded issues. And we had a lack of focus on them for too long,” he says. “But we are addressing it. There is a moral case and an economic case: we can’t afford to have so many young people who are feeling we have written them off.”A million young people aren’t in a job or training. Britain has a problem | Richard PartingtonRead moreViv Webb, who helps to run the I Can programme – operated by Dudley council and the NHS – left school during the 1980s recession when unemployment topped 3 million and herself benefited from a council jobs programme.She said: “It was very much the change from our industrial past to the brave new world and I think now we’re facing similar things. Our young people aren’t getting enough opportunities with employers.”Jake Rowe, 23, is one young person who has benefited. He found himself on universal credit after leaving college, but after the I Can programme is now in a job at Dudley council in children’s services. He knows first-hand how hard being young and on benefits is.“I was on the dole for over a year and, honestly, it wasn’t nice. You don’t get a lot of money. Obviously you’re looking for jobs, applying for things, and people don’t get back to you,” Rowe said.In Dudley town centre, Hunter hires about 350 temporary and permanent staff a week. He says many youngsters leaving school are unaware of the work available in Dudley, where there are more openings in manufacturing and logistics than technology or finance.Those wanting an office job might need to crawl through traffic on a bus to Birmingham, he says, at least while Dudley awaits the completion of its long-delayed tram link to the city.“It’s kind of like you see in Peaky Blinders – foundries and stuff like that. I’m not too sure people of that age a) want to go into that line of work, but b) are aware that you can work your way up in them.”The students in the town centre are unanimous that Dudley has its challenges.Map of Britain“I wouldn’t recommend coming here in the dark,” says Alfie Aston. He and his classmates, walking out of college in their mechanics overhauls, say Dudley – like many poorer towns in Britain – is “50-50” to grow up in.However, the students are also hopeful their qualifications will be a route to success.“It can definitely be hard to find work sometimes, especially being a young person with no experience,” says Aaron Hackett. “But studying this course, it’s one of the best trades. There are lots of places you can go.”Explore more on these topicsYouth unemploymentYoung peopleUnemploymentEconomic policyMinimum wageNational insuranceEmployment lawfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On its release in 1994 it became New Zealand’s highest grossing film and went on to make an international impact. As a result, Tamahori was hired to make period noir Mulholland Falls, starring Nick Nolte and Chazz Palminteri, to moderate acclaim and box office.However, Tamahori was now considered a reliable Hollywood operator, making the survival thriller The Edge, featuringAnthony Hopkinsopposite Bart the bear in a script by David Mamet, and Along Came a Spider, a James Patterson thriller starring Morgan Freeman.He then took on his most high-profile job, the Bond film Die Another Day, which would become famous for its invisible car and Halle Berry’s orange bikini. It would also prove to be Pierce Brosnan’s last outing as 007, before the reins were handed over to Daniel Craig.As Tamahori himself noted, the advent of the Bourne franchise ended up making the Brosnan era look a little old-fashioned, but the film proved a hit with audiences on its release in 2002, if not necessarily with critics.View image in fullscreenTemuera Morrison in Mahana (The Patriarch).Photograph: BERLINALE/EPAAfter Bond, Tamahori went on to another putative blockbuster sequel, XXX: State of the Union starring Ice Cube, after the original’s star Vin Diesel dropped out. He then made Nic Cage sci-fi thriller Next and political fable The Devil’s Double, about Saddam Hussein’s son Uday and his body double, both played by Dominic Cooper.Tamahori subsequently returned to New Zealand to make Mahana, based on Witi Ihimaera’s novel Bulibasha: King of the Gypsies, about a fictional Māori patriarch, in which he cast his Once Were Warriors lead actor Temuera Morrison.Saying it was shot as a “western, specifically a 1950s American western”, Tamahori was phlegmatic at its failure at the box office in its home country. “It’s a period film about a bygone era and it deals with the older generation, so young people didn’t go and see it.”In 2024 he released The Convert, starring Guy Pearce as a British missionary who becomes involved with local Māori.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersNew ZealandDie Another DayMāoriJames BondPierce BrosnannewsShareReuse this content"

A further 117 people were killed in the operation in two of Rio’s largest clusters of favelas – the Complexo do Alemão and the Complexo da Penha – in what the police said was a clampdown on organised crime.The raid attracted timely headlines and even approval for the regional governor, Cláudio Castro, an ally of the former president,Jair Bolsonaro, a climate change denier.View image in fullscreenA tribute by the Brazilian group Rio de Paz on Copacabana beach to four policemen killed in a raid last week, in which 121 people died.Photograph: AFP/GettyThe protest was an inauspicious start to a week in which Rio was hosting not only the C40 World Mayors Summit on climate change, co-chaired by London’s Sadiq Khan and Rio’s Social Democratic mayor, Eduardo Paes, but also Prince William’sEarthshot prizeevent. On Monday,Cop30 climate talkswill start in the port city of Belém, 2,000 miles to the north.Last week, the UN secretary general,António Guterres, acknowledged in aninterview with the Guardianthat it was now “inevitable” that humanity would overshoot the target set in Paris in 2015 of limiting global heating to 1.5C (2.7F), with “devastating consequences” for the world.Globally, despite extreme heat, floods and devastating wildfires, populist leaders, some sceptical but others in outright denial about the science, are talking up the costs of action rather than the consequences of inaction.View image in fullscreen‘Taking action’: London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, in Rio de Janeiro.Photograph: Alan Lima/GuardianThe purpose of the mayors’ summit, Khan says, is to push regional politicians, often backed by more progressive urban electorates, to go further in doing something about it.Cities account for 75% of global carbon emissions, he says. It was repeatedly noted that the second-biggest delegation after the Brazilians at the summit was the US one, with about 100 mayors attending in defiance of the White House –no high-level membersof the Trump administration are expected to attend the Cop30 talks.Khan says: “Mayors across the globe, and I includeLondon, are good examples of leaders, politicians, actually taking action.” His fellow city leaders are not just tinkering at the edges, he says, but seeking to turn the tide in the face of deniers such as Donald Trump, swirling misinformation, a doubting public and thorny, even violent, local politics.We talk to sixmayors on what they are doing about the climate crisis:Yvonne Aki-SawyerrMayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone;population1.4 millionView image in fullscreen‘You can’t obsess about it or you wouldn’t get anything done,’ says Freetown’s mayor, Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr.Photograph: Alan Lima/GuardianIt had been a difficult few days for Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr.

What caused that? “Unknown, unknown,” she says.“But there are a few things going on: I’m running for president, and I’ve been very vocal on narcotics,” she adds, calling it: “A series of unfortunate events.”It is not the first time she has had to face such threats but, she says: “You can’t obsess about it or you wouldn’t get anything done.”The impact of extreme weather, landslides and flooding has led to a burgeoning population in Aki-Sawyerr’s city, as subsistence farmers have concluded that they cannot make a living off the land.In 2015, the city’s population was just over a million. That is expectedto double by 2028. One consequence is a rising number of informal settlements replacing forests on the hillsides around the capital, and ever more logging to feed the wood-burning stoves that remain widespread, adding to the city’s carbon emissions.Aki-Sawyerr has few powers as mayor beyond sanitation. Much of her time is spent trying to use her role to get international financing for projects such as a cable car system to reduce vehicle emissions, or the planting of5 million trees by 2030.But how to stop people cutting those trees down? That’s where her sanitation powers come in. “We’re actually converting faecal sludge into briquettes as an alternative cooking fuel,” she says.“It is odourless, it’s dried, it’s carbonised – and by the end of December, we will have a machine that we’re importing that will enable us to produce the briquettes at scale.“We’ve tested in homes, we’ve put them out to communities, and they’ve been really well received. What we haven’t been able to do is to produce them at scale.”Giuseppe SalaMayor of Milan, Italy; population 1.4millionView image in fullscreen‘Step by step,’ says Giuseppe Sala, mayor of Milan.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianIt amazes Giuseppe Sala, a member of the Italian Green party and the mayor of Milan for nearly 10 years, how little he sees of Giorgia Meloni, the far-right prime minister of Italy. She has been to the city perhaps three times in as many years, he says.She has, however, expressed her concerns about the “ideological” nature of theEuropean Green Dealplan to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.One of the projects Sala thinks the rest of Italy could learn from is a campaign called “I don’t waste”, which involves primary school pupils being given a reusable bag to take home any uneaten food from school lunches. City hall calculations suggest it saves approximately 10,000 sandwiches, 9,000 pieces of fruit and 1,000 desserts from being wasted every month.He has also brought in a low-emission zone to Milan, the largest in the EU that bans non-compliant cars. Milan remains congested but the air quality is improving and after a difficult first year it has been accepted by the public, he says.Two months ago, he banned private vehicles entirely from the roads around Via Monte Napoleone, the city’s fashion centre. “Always make step by step,” he says, though he expects the 2027 mayoral election to be dominated by the issue, with his opponents insisting: “You have the right to drive your car where you want.”“So that will be a good moment to see if the sensitivity of the people could change,” he says.Nick ReeceMayor ofMelbourne, Australia; metro population5.4 millionView image in fullscreen‘We don’t want to see a race to the bottom,’ says Nick Reece, mayor of Melbourne.Photograph: Alan Lima/GuardianIt was when a new planning application for a £100m datacentre came across his desk that Nick Reece, lord mayor for a year in the south-eastern Australian city of Melbourne, started asking questions.In the race to become smart cities, we don’t want to cook the planetNick Reece“I was asking the team: what’s the energy consumption going to be of this new data centre?” he says. The answer was that these computing facilities would account for a fifth of the city’s energy consumption by 2040.He is now lobbying for a national and international set of rules to govern datacentres. “If we don’t get some framework in place, which means that these new datacentres are principally powered by renewable power, then we are not going to be able to achieve our carbon-reduction targets,” he says.“We don’t want to see a race to the bottom around artificial-intelligence infrastructure.”Reece also wants companies to consider how to best use the energy produced by the centres, such as heating swimming pools in the city, which often rely on gas-fired boilers.“In the race to become smart cities, we don’t want to cook the planet,” he says. “That would be ironic and a tragedy.”Kate GallegoMayor of Phoenix, US; population 1.6millionView image in fullscreenIt has become ‘more complex to finance projects’, says Kate Gallego, mayor of Phoenix.Photograph: Alan Lima/GuardianLast year, the city of Phoenix, Arizona, broke its own temperature record with113 days above 100F(38C). “We hit 110 [fahrenheit] in October, which had never happened before,” she says.“Close to Halloween, the pumpkins that my kids had, they sort of melted. It really was very serious. The first week of school for my eight-year-old [this year], we had 118[F]; they couldn’t go outside,” she says.“I think that has helped us with the political consensus.”‘The fans just circulate hot air’: how indoor heat is making life unbearable in India’s sweltering citiesRead moreEven for Phoenix, a city in the desert, this was extreme but looking across the world it was an extraordinary year. “We talked to the UK’s fire department about how we manage heat and how we keep our firefighters safe during heatwaves,” Gallego says.While Phoenix burns, however, Donald Trump has turned off the financial taps. “We benefited enormously from the renewable energy tax credits, so losing those has been very difficult, and makes it more complex to finance projects,” she says.“We received a significant grant called Solar For All [for low-income and disadvantaged households], which we are losing. Our electric vehicle spending grants have been suspended.“The change in administration has dramatically impacted the amount of federal support we received.”The state ofArizonavoted for Trump, but Gallego says the extreme temperatures meant there was significant support for policies that both reduced emissions, such as investment in a light railway, and offered some mitigation, such as coating pavements with cooling materials so they absorb less heat, lowering the temperature of the streets and ensuring fewer potholes emerge as a result of the asphalt expanding and shrinking.Carolina BasualdoMayor of Despeñaderos, Argentina; population, 9,000View image in fullscreen‘We’ve been working very hard,’ says Carolina Basualdo, mayor of Despeñaderos.Photograph: Alan Lima/The GuardianIt is yet to be seen whether anyone from the Argentinian government will turn up in Belém for the Cop30 climate talks. Like Trump, the country’s president, Javier Milei, does not accept the scientific consensus about the human-made impact on the climate. He has called the crisis a“socialist lie”.What this means for Carolina Basualdo, the mayor of a small city in the Córdoba region in the centre of the country, is clear. “We getnada, nothing,” she says when asked about government funding for policies designed to mitigate the impact of climate change.The impact of the crisis on her city is clear, she says. It endures three heatwaves a year these days; hot days can be followed by storms, with hailstones the size of tennis balls. Basualdo has rolled out a programme of solar panels on roofs, standardised the temperature at 24C (75F) in municipal buildings to save on energy consumption from air conditioning, and is using pruning waste from parks as an environmentally friendly source of firewood for boilers.Plastic polytunnels used by farms for the production of fruit are recycled into bags and wallets by women at a local gender violence refuge. The mayor, with funds from Bloomberg Philanthropies, was able to help a local basketball club to replace its granite floor with one from two tonnes of plastic bottle caps collected by the community. “We’ve been working very hard,” she says.Evandro LeitãoMayor of Fortaleza, Brazil, population 2.7millionView image in fullscreen‘You have to be a great balance,’ says Evandro Leitão, mayor of Fortaleza.Photograph: Alan Lima/Guardian“He was isolated and just did what he wanted,” says Evandro Leitão, mayor of Fortaleza, the fourth-biggest city in Brazil, known for its stifling heat. He is talking about Jair Bolsonaro, the former president who wasjailed in September for 27 yearsfor conspiring to overturn his 2022 election loss to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is in the same Workers’ party as Leitão.Bolsonaro slashed environmental protections andpromoted clearing and settling the Amazon rainforest. His administration oversaw a 60% increase in deforestation rates – the highest relative increase in a presidential term since satellite monitoring began. Lula has signalled that he wants Brazil to be a climate powerhouse, investing in renewable energy and forest conservation.In the last 10 months that he has been mayor, Leitão has overseen the latest construction of micro-parks in his city, expanding the amount of green space by 40%, equivalent to 4,100 football pitches in five years.There are, however, concerns being raised about the Brazilian government’s recent announcement that it issuspending the soy moratorium, which recognised deforestation as a threat posed by clearing land for the legume.Brazil’sstate oil company Petrobras has also been given permissionto drill for oil near the mouth of the Amazon River. “You have to be a great balance between the development of the country, but also to preserve the green areas of the country,” Leitão said. That’s a challenge that I have to struggle with, too.”Travel costs to theWorldMayorsSummit were covered byC40, a group of97 citiesthat have signed up to climate crisis goals.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentClimate crisisArizonaArgentinaBrazilRio de JaneiroJavier MileifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photographs by Matteo Del Vecchio and Sara VendittiThe age of extinction is supported byAbout this contentFri 7 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareAn hour or so after sunset, green twinkles of possibility gleam beneath the hedgerows of Westbury-sub-Mendip in Somerset. Under an orange August moon, the last female glow-worms of the season are making one final push at finding a mate.For almost 20 years, Peter Bright and other volunteers have combed the village’s shrubberies and grasslands, searching for the bioluminescent beetles as part of theUK glow-worm survey. Most years, they have counted between 100 and 150, rising to 248 in 2017.During last year’s wet summer and this year’s dry one, they found barely 50, says Bright, a retired science teacher taking a group on a late-night glow-worm walk. By August, the remaining lights are something of a lonely hearts club – many of the adult males have already died.Glow-worms and fireflies comprise about2,200 species of bioluminescent beetles around the world, with 65 found in Europe. The UK has two, including the common glow-worm (Lampyris noctiluca)– which is not a worm and only the females truly glow – while Italy has17 species.View image in fullscreenBen Cooke, a National Trust ranger, places a glow-worm trap near Winspit Quarry in Dorset. Photograph: P Flude/GuardianAcross Europe, five species of glow-worm are threatened with extinction, another two are endangered, and the common glow-worm is classified as near threatened, according to the International Union forConservationof Nature.“Once, these things were much more common than they are now,” says Tim Gardiner, an entomologist. “Nobody could have realised what would happen to them.” His18-year surveyfound that the numbers ofLnoctilucain Essex were falling byabout 3.5% a year.Similar trends have been observed inFrance,GermanyandSpain, though the insects, which live quiet, secretive lives in the foliage, are not easy to survey accurately. “There is so much that we don’t know about fireflies,” says Ana Catalán, who researches firefly genomics at Germany’s Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.Their vulnerability is part of a much larger story: more than40% of insect speciesare in decline, according to a global review from 2019, and scientists have warned that the picture may bemore direthan is already known.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAna Catalán, an evolutionary biologist, checks a global firefly collection for a DNA study at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich’s biomedical centre, and a researcher checks his trap for fireflies“We need more data,” says Alan Stewart, an ecologist at the University of Sussex, adding: “We haven’t really got the luxury of waiting another 50 years to find out.”For glow-worms, some of the threats are clear. Hotter summers threaten the slugs and snails they feed on as larvae, while habitat loss and fragmentation have extinguished whole populations. As female glow-worms cannot fly, they are bound to spend their lives close to where they hatched, so a change as seemingly minor as a new ditch can devastate a population.Light pollution disrupts their mating displays, with artificial lights sometimes luring males away from the female’s green glow. “Street lights are a real hazard to them,” says John Tyler, a naturalist who has studied the insects for decades.View image in fullscreenMany people have childhood memories of catching fireflies and keeping them in a jar. In eastern cultures, they were decorations and even used as a light sourceThese trends recur around the world. In Italy, more agricultural activity on the plains of northern Italy and in the northern Apennine mountains has been linked with declining numbers of a range of different species, according to a 2020 study published inthe journal BioScience.In Spain, the abandonment of small orchards – and the lack of irrigation that follows – makes it harder for snails, glow-worms’ preferred food, to thrive. In both countries, more streetlights seem to correlate with fewer glow-worms.We realised that to protect and preserve this place, we had to make people love itRuggero RognoniSome people have attempted to take matters into their own hands. Fabio Falchi, an Italian physics professor and light-pollution expert in Mantua, Lombardy, took steps to reduce light pollution in his garden, including using motion sensors for outdoor lights and allowing it to grow wild.Now, Falchi says: “Every May, our lawn comes alive with their tiny flickers. It’s beautiful to watch them move.” Their cat, he adds, is mesmerised.Others have proposed more drastic steps. Since 2020, Pete Cooper, an ecologist and species-reintroduction specialist in Bristol, has bred glow-worms in captivity, with a view to re-establishing healthy populations in places where they have not been seen for decades.View image in fullscreenThe spread of streetlights amid trees and plants not only diminishes valuable dark-sky reserves but also affects the health of vegetation, making photosynthesis less efficienrtAs part of a partnership between Restore, an ecological restoration business, and the Wildwood Trust, a conservation organisation with parks in Kent and Devon, many of theseinsects will be reintroducedto Nosterfield nature reserve, near Ripon in North Yorkshire.But it will take years to determine the success of their efforts – glow-worms have a two-year life cycle – and some optimism is involved, Cooper says. “That’s the thing with glow-worm reintroduction – it’s not as simple as you’d think.”Tyler says: “We don’t know what habitat is good for them, in any detail. You can find sites that look ideal, but if you try to introduce or reintroduce glow-worms, you can never guarantee that they’ll take.”View image in fullscreenA researcher inItalyplaces traps forLuciola italicafemalesView image in fullscreenFireflies are preyed on by spiders but if they are caught and not immediately eaten, they emit a light with a different frequency. This serves as a warning to other fireflies that there is a spiderweb in that locationGlow-worm enthusiasts are divided on reintroduction efforts, which they worry may distract from preserving existing populations or embolden developers to build in ancient countryside.“Before you reintroduce something, you really need to know why it disappeared in the first place,” says Stewart. “Otherwise, they’re not going to survive.”Rewilding can help bolster the insects in riverside areas where they already thrive, says Gardiner. “You need to manage the habitats quite well,” he says. “The corridors between them have disappeared in the last 70 years – hedgerows removed, meadows ploughed up.”Areas that have been rewilded sometimes see glow-worm populations boom. In the early 1990s, a group of volunteers in the Italian village of Binasco, near Milan, began reclaiming and revitalising a plot of land between the highway and a local sports pitch.After a few years, they noticed more and more fireflies, says Ruggero Rognoni, a member of the local environmental association.View image in fullscreenAfter more than 20 years, fireflies have returned to this former construction site by the Milan-Genoa motorway, which was saved after a campaign and transformed into a forestView image in fullscreenAt the thin border between the restored forest and the highway, the noise of bulldozers and asphalt give way to the quiet of nature“We realised that to protect and preserve this place, we had to make people love it,” Rognoni says.A first step was inviting local children to come for night walks to see the fireflies with their parents, a tradition that has continued. “That’s how we’ve managed to protect it,” he says.Such walks exist around the world and are growing in popularity. On the glow-worm walk in Westbury, locals linger along country paths, as a barn owl screeches overhead. Over a couple of hours, careful eyes spot almost a dozen female glow-worms waiting at ankle-height.The average glow-worm female lays 100 to 150 eggs – it’s a numbers’ game. You might have a brilliant year, then it might suddenly crashJohn HorneAmanda Bennett, 48, gently pulls a female from the grass and places it on her hand, transfixed by the green glow that spreads across her fingers. “I can’t believe I’ve never seen one before,” she says.Glow-worms were once a far more common sight, especially for people strolling on summer nights.Tyler was first introduced to them about 50 years ago, in a family friend’s garden. “I didn’t even know they were real,” he says.That night, Tyler saw more than he has on any single occasion since. “It was like looking down on a village,” he adds. “All these dots of light.”View image in fullscreenFireflies are increasingly under threat but rewilding efforts have succeeded in boosting numbersThey have an unusual capacity to captivate people. John Horne, an amateur naturalist, first discovered them in his Hampshire garden about 25 years ago.After observing them for years, including discoveringPhosphaenus hemipterus, a rarer species, Horne is more optimistic about their prospects than some. “The average glow-worm female lays 100 to 150 eggs – it’s a numbers’ game,” he says. “You might have a brilliant year, and then it might suddenly crash.”Where many species find it harder to capture the imagination, glow-worms can be a “gateway drug”, as Cooper puts it, for connecting with nature.Tyler says: “If it has to start with something that glows out of its bottom, then so be it.”View image in fullscreenA firefly-lit path winds through the Gardens of Ninfa, south of Rome, which is one of Italy’s most renowned nature reservesFind moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsThe age of extinctionEndangered speciesInsectsAnimalsConservationWildlifeEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Reimphoto/GettyA pilot scheme where students eat nutritious breakfasts using donated surplus food builds on the ‘folkhem’ welfare model to boost health and sustainabilityByJonna Dagliden HuntFri 7 Nov 2025 09.55 ESTFirst published on Fri 7 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTShareStudents at Mariebergsskolan, a secondary school in Karlstad,Sweden, make their way to the canteen to grab a juice shot. This morning’s options include ginger and lemon, apple, golden milk, lemon and mint, or strawberry and orange. There’s also the choice of overnight oats with caramelised milk.It’s just after 9am and the space is usually empty, but thanks to a project launched in 2018 by Vinnova, Sweden’s national innovation agency, students are starting their day with a boost from the energy bar. All the ingredients are donated by local supermarkets which are giving away surplus fruit and vegetables to minimise food waste.Mariebergsskolan was one of a handful of schools to take part in the project and alongside the energy station, the canteen has also been transformed with input from students in workshops. It now resembles a cosy restaurant, with curtains to help absorb sound, cream-coloured walls and a variety of seating options.“One of the things students asked for was to choose seating based on their mood,” says Linnea Olsson Lee, a food strategist based in Karlstad. “Sometimes you want to sit on your own – we’ve added bar stools facing the window for that – without feeling observed. Other times you want to sit in a large group at the communal table, or in smaller, more intimate groups. We’ve tried to create different zones. Now students are genuinely proud of their school restaurant.”The pilot project, launched in partnership with seven government agencies, including the SwedishFoodAgency (Livsmedelsverket), has meant students are more inclined to stay at school rather than head to the nearest kiosk for sweets.Teachers have also noticed that students seem more engaged. Olsson Lee recalls one student saying in a workshop: “If there’s a free alternative at school, then I might consider eating something healthy.” The goal, she explains, has been to gently challenge students with new flavours and textures – and it’s working.Another benefit of the work has been an initiative funded by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket), which makes it easier for public-sector chefs to order locally grown produce.Sweden’s universal school-meal programme serves about 2m meals daily (at an annual cost of7,700 Swedish kronor[£614] per student) and is rooted in the welfare state model known as “folkhem”, launched in the 1930s. Free school meals were introduced in 1946 and since 2011 it has been a legal requirement that they be nutritious.However, in 2018, the Swedish Food Agency flagged that school meals were not contributing to growing issues around healthy eating and sustainability. In response, Vinnova set up a joint food programme to work towards the aim that all pupils should eat tasty and sustainable food. Behind that lay a bigger idea: progress in school meal sustainability would act as a lever to transform Sweden’s broader food system.There were workshops for students, local food producers and town councils, and the Swedish Food Agency came up with ideas for change based on a system they call the “snowball method”: starting with small, local, bottom-up activities and then growing in scale.View image in fullscreenSwedish students start their school day with healthy breakfasts and teachers have said they seem more engaged.Photograph: Maskot/GettyThe pilot scheme has been drawn on for Sweden’s national food strategy 2.0 and the 2025 guidelines for school meals.Alexander Alvsilver, the area lead for future-proof society at Vinnova, does worry about who will take over when Vinnova steps away from the initiative. The climate crisis, the need for resilient local food systems and rising child obesity levels show the challenge won’t be solved by one actor or one project, he says. “Key players need to step in or step up. Together,” Alvsilver says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, prototyping is based on design thinking – a method not yet part of the standard skillset in most government agencies.”Follow-up work is continuing in Karlstad and elsewhere. A recent initiative has promised 1m Swedish kronor (about £80,000) to a shared activity among students on the condition they help reduce food waste. For each kilogram of wasted food, the promised sum is reduced, monitored by a digital counter at school canteens and available to view online. At present, it stands at 96,790 SEK – a result of a 1.7-tonne reduction in food waste compared with the previous year.Fish mint, Himalayan chives and berry pickle: how wild ingredients are transforming school lunches in IndiaRead moreAt Mariebergsskolan, more students are heading to the energy bar, keen to try the different combinations of juice. A group of boys chat animatedly at one of the communal tables as they tuck into overnight oats.Despite the success, however, Olsson Lee also acknowledges some of the challenges. “In Sweden, we sometimes take free school meals for granted,” she says. “We spend a lot of money on them, so we need to use them as an optimal resource. It’s still a challenge to secure funding for renovations, for making changes – or even finding the time.“Fortunately, the work we’ve done has earned us credibility when speaking to politicians. For some students, this may be the only cooked meal they eat in a day. It’s also a way to help reduce socioeconomic inequalities. In the end, you have to see it as something that must be done step by step.”Explore more on these topicsThe alternativesSwedenSchool mealsFoodFood wasteEuropeCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These materials are vital components in electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, fighter jets and guided missiles, with demand also driven by increased defence budgets inthe EU,USandChina, and throughout the world.The difficulty for Quintero and his team, stationed in Puerto Carreño along the Orinoco River, is that unknown quantities of some of the world’s most sought-after minerals are being funnelled through fraudulent schemes that mask their origin before reaching international buyers.“We’re talking about groups financing themselves through illicit economies: mining, drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping,” says Quintero. “There is no ideology at this point.”The rare earth elements and critical minerals are being extracted in areas under the control of guerrilla groups, involving systematic human rights abuses and accelerating environmental destruction in one of Earth’s most vital ecosystems.Quintero’s view is shared by António Guterres, the UN secretary-general. Earlier this year, he warned “an imminent threat grows ever greater”, noting that most of the critical minerals needed for the global energy transition “are found in or near Indigenous people’s territories”.View image in fullscreenA mining post along the bank of the Inírida River in ColombiaThe problem is growing in the Amazon Basin: the Guiana Shield, one of Earth’s oldest continental fragments, dating back more than 1.7bn years, harbours rich deposits of critical minerals, including tin, tungsten, tantalum and rare earth elements.Near the Orinoco River, on the Colombian side, men from the Indigenous Curripaco and Piaroa communities are keen to show the blackish-blue stones and gravel they keep in a bag. “You can see the difference in the nuggets between tin and coltan,” says one of the men, who have agreed to meet on condition their identities remain hidden.They tore everything down and made an airport. It’s horrible. In two or three years, the entire river will be contaminatedVenezuelan minerFor years, he says, he concealed his work in the Venezuelan Orinoco region, moving minerals by canoe across the river at night to find buyers in Colombia. When global markets for critical minerals boomed, everything changed.Mines near his community in Venezuela’s Bolívar state were seized in 2023 when hundreds of insurgents from theNational Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia’s largest active guerrilla group, arrived, accompanied by Chinese buyers. “Months later, they brought in helicopters. They were taking the materials away,” he recalls.When the guerrillas took control, Indigenous leaders were co-opted, threatened or bought off. Those who refused to work under the ELN could only continue their work secretly at night in hidden mining points.View image in fullscreenThe Colombian navy patrols a docking area in Puerto Carreño, along the Orinoco River; Venezuela lies on the opposite riverbank“They have lots of armed people and control everything,” says a young Venezuelan Indigenous member of the ELN. “Now most of the Indigenous people are there, [working] with them.”In Amazonas and north-western Bolívar state, where most critical mineral mines are located, the ELN’s José Daniel Pérez Carrero Front and the Farc dissident group Acacio Medina Front of Segunda Marquetalia,listed in the US as terrorist organisations, divide the territory and mines while sharing drug trafficking routes.The rapid deforestation accompanying some mining operations alarms even local miners. “They tore everything down and made an airport. It’s horrible,” one miner says. “In two or three years, the entire river will be contaminated because many high-calibre machines have already come in.”View image in fullscreenA Venezuelan miner shows some small stones which may contain minerals, taken from Colombian guerrilla-controlled mines in Bolívar stateGuerrilla groups also allegedly control sex work in mining areas. “The guerrillas are the ones selling women for gold,” says another source. Others describe executions and improvised jungle prisons used by armed groups to punish those breaking their rules.Critical minerals first gained geopolitical significance in the Amazon Basin in 2009, when the then president,Hugo Chávez, announcedthat Venezuela possessed a “great reserve” of coltan – also known as “blue gold”. Chávez deployed 15,000 National Guard troops near the Colombian border, alleging that those minerals, “strategic for making long-range rockets”, had caused “countless wars in Africa”.Amid a regulatory vacuum, traders and clandestine miners rushed to the region in the early 2010s, chasing what they saw as a new gold rush. It wasn’t until 2016, three years after Chávez’s death, that his successor, Nicolás Maduro, signed theOrinoco mining arc decree, designating 43,243 sq miles (112,000 sq km) for mining development, including areas designated for coltan extraction.However, the expected foreign investment never came through. Instead of mining corporations, armed groups seized control of southern Venezuela’s mining districts, fundamentally transforming the industry.View image in fullscreenA mining site near the Orinoco River in Colombia’s Vichada department, where mineral prospecting reveals potential for tin-tantalum concentrate and rare earthsThe circumstances were different in Brazil, as the country carried out geological surveys of its subsoil throughout the 1970s military dictatorship. Today, to safeguard the world’s largest niobium reserves and the second-largest deposits of rare earth elements, the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has embraced a “national sovereignty” strategy, maintaining government oversight while supporting international partnerships.“If it’s critical, I keep it for myself,”Lula has said. Recent deals with the UAE and talks with the Trump administration indicate Brazil remains open for business.On the Colombian side of the border, six hours from Puerto Inírida in the Guainía department, a small Puinave Indigenous village of about 750 people is situated along the riverbank.

He says gold mining is harder now“Gold mining is the only means for us to get sustenance for our families,” says Luis Camelo, the village captain, speaking after an evening evangelical service. However, there is growing concern over the depleting deposits. “Gold production is no longer what it used to be,” Camelo notes.He carefully untwists the lid on a plastic jar, revealing glittery blackish sand. “It is an unknown material at the moment, but we’re going to send it for examination to see if it’s valuable,” he says.Lab tests of Camelos’s samples, as well as others gathered from both sides of the border, indicate that the uncharted jungle deposits contain high concentrations of coltan and cassiterite (tin ore), as well as rare earth elements.There won’t be any shortage of takers for the minerals. Dozens of interviews with miners, traffickers, mineral traders and law enforcement agencies reveal that critical minerals from the Amazon can be traced to exporters in Colombian and Venezuelan Caribbean port cities. Much of it is destined for China.View image in fullscreenOn patrol in Amanaven, Colombia, across from VenezuelaChina’s export restrictionson critical rare earth elements, imposed in April as retaliation for US tariffs, have intensified global competition for alternative supply sources.

He was arrested in Finsbury Park, north London, on Friday after police said they had received a call from a member of the public.The erroneousrelease, and that of another prisoner who was mistakenly freed, has led tomounting political pressure on David Lammy, the justice secretary, days after he introduced stringent checks for jails.The Guardian view on mistaken prisoner releases: a broken system not human error | EditorialRead moreLammy had refused several times to say whether any more prisoners had been released in error in a bruising session of prime minister’s questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, having been ambushed with a string of questions.The moment that Kaddour-Cherif was detained appears to have beencaptured by a Sky News camera crewin Finsbury Park at 11.30am, where a man initially claimed to be someone else.Police officers then approached him and put him into the back of a police van after telling him he was under arrest “on suspicion of being wanted after being falsely released from prison”.When he initially denied being Kaddour-Cherif, the arresting officer told him he “looked exactly” like him and had a “very distinctive wonky nose”.View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy said the Labour government had inherited a prison system in crisis.Photograph: Jacob King/PAPolice brought him to the back of the van and held up an image of Kaddour-Cherif next to his face before uncuffing and recuffing his hands behind his back. Officers searched his backpack and found a laptop, umbrella and wallet.Before he was put in the back of a police van, Kaddour-Cherif turned to those gathered and said: “Look at the justice of the UK, they release people by mistake, after this they ‘ah ah ah’ … it’s not my fucking fault.”A homeless man who stays in the Finsbury Park area claimed he had called the police after recognising Kaddour-Cherif from a newspaper photograph.“I am proud Algerian. I am proud British. We do the right thing,” Nadjib Mekdhia, 50, told the PA news agency.TheMetropolitan police, which had launched a manhunt for Kaddour-Cherif, had expressed frustration that he had had a “six-day head start” because the mistaken release was only reported to the Met a week later, on 4 November.Kaddour-Cherif was identified as an overstayer five years ago, but had not been removed from the UK. When he was mistakenly freed from prison, he had been serving a sentence for trespass with intent to steal.He was convicted for indecent exposure in November 2024, when he was given an 18-month community order and placed on the sex offender register for five years.It is understood Kaddour-Cherif has not applied for asylum and was in the initial stages of being deported for overstaying his visa when he was let out.He entered the UK on a visitor visa in 2019, but was flagged as an automatic case of having overstayed on 6 February 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My thanks are with the police and staff at HMPPS [HM Prison and Probation Service] who have been working around the clock.0:54Moment mistakenly released prisoner Billy Smith hands himself in – video“We inherited a prison system in crisis and I’m appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing.”However, the Conservatives made calls on Friday night for the prisoner to be deported “as soon as his sentence is finished”.Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “This case sums up the total collapse of law and order under ‘Calamity Lammy’. A foreign sex offender, meant to be deported, strolling the streets of London because Labour can’t even keep track of its prisoners.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The vast majority of offenders released by mistake are quickly brought back to prison, and we will do everything we can to work with the police to capture the few still in the community.“These cases only further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited. This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.”The other prisoner who was mistakenly released, a fraudster, handed himself back in on Thursday. While Lammy insisted the government would clamp down on clerical errors, William Smith was filmed waving to cameras and hugging his partner before he walked back into HMP Wandsworth, in south-westLondon.Smith, 35, usually known as Billy, had been sentenced to 45 months for multiple fraud offences at Croydon crown court on Monday, but was then released in error by the prison.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationMetropolitan policePoliceLondonEnglandDavid LammyUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

He was cleared of a further six counts.The first posts made by Barton targeted the female football pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko after the two women had worked on the coverage of a 17 January 2024 FA Cup tie between Everton and Crystal Palace.Barton, a longtime critic of female involvement in men’s football, made disparaging remarks about the women’s punditry of the fixture and compared them to notorious serial killers, calling them the “Fred and Rose West of football commentary”. He went on to superimpose the faces of the two women on to a photograph of the murderers. Ward told the court on Tuesday that these posts left her feeling “physically scared”.He also posted that Aluko was in the “Joseph Stalin/Pol Pot category” as she had “murdered hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of football fans’ ears”, before alleging that she was only “there to tick boxes”, adding: “DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] is a load of shit. Affirmative action. All off the back of the BLM/George Floyd nonsense.”Barton’s attack on the two women led to the broadcaster Jeremy Vine attempting to intervene, telling the court on Wednesday he had been “quite shocked by what Mr Barton had said about two very respected commentators”, and had asked if he was “dealing with a brain injury here?”Barton responded by calling Vine a “bike nonce”, asking him if he had “been on Epstein Island” and if he was “going to be on these flight logs”, before telling him he might as well “own up now because I’d phone the police if I saw you near a primary school on ya bike”. He then posted an image of Vine with the caption: “If you see this fella by a primary school call 999.”Vine told the court he took these allegations seriously and felt “physically unsafe” because of them, worried that Barton’s “like-minded” followers could interpret them as real, saying: “If people want to find out where you live, they can.” Vine also said that as a result of Barton’s posts: “I took some advice about my security; I varied my movements. I do believe these messages put me in danger, in physical danger.”Barton alleged he was the victim of “political prosecution” and downplayed the posts as “crude banter” and “a spat between celebrities online” when cross-examined on Thursday.He said: “This was the state, in my opinion, trying to squeeze me into the ground. This is a state prosecution, I believe, for whatever their agendas are in pushing on people.”Barton said he did not intend to actually call Vine a paedophile and that his posts directed towards the broadcaster were “a wind-up” and “a bad, dark, juvenile joke”.At one point during cross examination, the prosecutor Peter Wright KC called Barton’s explanations “nonsense”, to which the former player responded by asking: “Are you calling me a nonce?” Wright in turn responded: “No, nonsense.”Barton went on to say he had not tried to “cause distress or anxiety or risk his life or his daughters’ lives”, adding: “I don’t want people to fear for their lives. I’m a dad.”In a statement after the hearing, Aluko said: “Social media is a cesspit where too many people feel they can say things to others they wouldn’t dream of saying in real life under the guise of freedom of speech.“This is a reminder that actions online do not come without consequences,.”“The messages directed at me, Lucy Ward and Jeremy Vine by Joey Barton were deeply distressing and had a real damaging impact on my life and career. I am glad that justice has been served.”Barton is due to be sentenced on 8 December, with his bail conditions prohibiting him from mentioning the three victims in any way before then.Explore more on these topicsJoey BartonCrimeSocial mediaDigital mediaJeremy VinenewsShareReuse this content"

He was arrested on Thursday night in Tidworth in Wiltshire by specialist officers from the National Crime Agency’s national extradition unit.An arrest warrant for Purkiss was issued by a court in Nairobi in September.Purkiss served as a medic with the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, the infantry regiment for the north-west of England, including on tours of Afghanistan.Wanjiru, 21, a hairdresser who had a baby daughter, vanished after a night out in 2012, and her body was found two months later in the grounds of the hotel where she had last been seen.Joel Smith KC, appearing on behalf of the Home Office, told the court: “Soldiers in the British army … were in Nanyuki, Kenya on a six-week training exercise. The defendant was amongst those soldiers. “There is evidence that when the soldiers were given time off, they would go into town, drink heavily, and they would pay local women for sex.”Smith said some of the soldiers left their base and went drinking in the town on the night of 31 March. “They were drinking heavily. Many of them, including this defendant, ended up in the Lions Court hotel,” he said.Smith told the court: “Some soldiers had booked rooms or cottages in the hotel grounds,” and that Waniju and two friends had also gone out that night, ending up at the hotel where they met soldiers.“The last time Ms Wanjiru was seen alive, she was leaving the hotel with a soldier. As she left, she told a friend in her local language that she was going to ‘hustle for her daughter’,” he said, telling the court that Wanjiru “was never seen alive again”.“She didn’t return home the next day to pick up her daughter,” Smith told the court. “Her friends started to look for her, and on April 2 she was reported missing to the police.”View image in fullscreenRose Wanyua Wanjiku, the elder sister to Agnes Wanjiru, holds a photograph of Agnes.Photograph: Brian Inganga/APSmith said that about two months later, on 5 June, “in the grounds within the hotel, they found her body decomposing in a septic tank”.He said a postmortem identified a 2cm stab wound to the lower abdomen and a collapsed lung, and concluded Wanjiru “might have been alive when placed in the septic tank”.Smith said inquiries had “uncovered confessions” made by Purkiss to fellow soldiers about the incident in Kenya, adding one spoke of seeing Purkiss “cry”. He said: “When he was asked why, the defendant said ‘I’ve killed her’.”The court heard that in the following days, there were “rumours on camp that the defendant had killed someone”. In an alleged confession, Purkiss is said to have told a colleague “it was sex that went wrong”.In 2018, former members of the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment had shared messages over Facebook, Smith told the court, with one soldier posting a picture of himself outside the Lions Court hotel with the comment: “If you know you know.”The soldier also referenced the septic tank, he said, adding Purkiss had sent a “smiling face emoji” in response, and when a group member asked him “do you get choked up?”, he replied: “Come to think of it I have had a sore throat today.”Purkiss shook his head in the dock as Smith set out the allegation against him.Purkiss’s lawyer, David Josse, said his client “vehemently denies” murder.Josse made the case for bail, on grounds that Purkiss had known since 2021 that he was under suspicion for murder, and in recent weeks became aware an extradition request was likely.Rather than abscond, he instructed solicitors, secured Ministry of Defence funding to pay for some of his legal costs and had been “transparent and cooperative” with the police, he told the court.He noted that if Purkiss absconded he would lose 90% of his assets. “This man is as compliant as any requested person possibly could be,” he said.Following the hearing, Wanjiru’s niece, Esther Njoki, said: “My family is incredibly relieved to hear that the suspect in my aunt’s case has been arrested.“We have waited so many years for this moment which marks an important step towards finally obtaining justice for our beloved Agnes.”The family’s lawyer, Tessa Gregory of the law firm Leigh Day, added: “This is a huge moment for our client and her family who have been fighting for over a decade to obtain justice for Agnes.“We hope the UK and Kenyan authorities will now work together to ensure that the suspect can face trial in Kenya as quickly as possible.”Judge Clarke remanded Purkiss into custody and denied him bail on grounds that he faced “a very serious allegation”.He will be given the opportunity to make a further application for bail on 14 November via video link. A further case management hearing has been scheduled for 9 December.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

I do feel there’s no emergency number to call. ‘I’d like to report a crime. Yeah, someone stole me.’ There is no one to report this to.”Concluding the episode, Barnett said she hoped “the normalisation – which we both said needs to happen around perimenopause and this degradation of one’s hormones that happens from … the age of 30s right through in women – can move into common parlance”.Hot flashes and mood swings: why perimenopausal symptoms get misdiagnosed – and how to treat themRead morePerimenopause is the transitional period leading up to menopause, where ovaries gradually produce less oestrogen, causing symptoms such as irregular periods and hot flushes, while menopause is the definitive point after periods have stopped for 12 consecutive months.Conversations and awareness about menopause and perimenopause have increased significantly in recent years, in part thanks to the work of high-profile figures, such as the broadcaster Davina McCall and the comedian Bridget Christie.But the increased knowledge has been coupled with what health experts have called a “menopause gold rush”, as companies, celebrities and influencers take advantage of a “dearth” of reliable information on the issue.Women’s health academics at University College London have said healthcare companies and content creators viewed menopause as a “lucrative market” and were trying to profit from gaps in public understanding.Researchers have called for the rollout of a national education programme after finding a significant number of women do not feel well-informed about menopause.Writing in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health, they said: “There has been a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit; this has been termed the ‘menopause gold rush’.”Explore more on these topicsMenopauseWomen's healthHealthWomenBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

The idea forms the centrepiece of the “democracy shield” pitched by the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, when she sought a second term before the 2024 European elections.Von der Leyenannounced the ideaof a European Centre for Democratic Resilience ina speechto MEPs in September. The document, due to be released on 12 November, sketches out further details, including where the commission sees its biggest threat. “In addition to its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine,Russia is also escalating hybrid attacks, waging a battle of influence against Europe,” states the draft seen by the Guardian. “By spreading deceitful narratives, sometimes including the manipulation and falsification of historical facts, they try to erode trust in democratic systems.”The EU’s foreign service says it has identified dozens of instances of Russian disinformation and information manipulation, such as theDoppelganger campaign in the run-up to the European elections, where copycat versions of well-known media sites promulgated anti-western narratives.Disinformation was carried on websites mimicking media outlets such as Die Welt, Le Point, La Stampa and Polskie Radio as part of the campaign, believed to have been active since 2022. On these copycat sites, fake articles, which were also widely promoted on social media, sought to discredit politicians, as well as undermine government support for Ukrainian refugees or Ukraine.China has also been identified as a disinformation threat and is alleged to use private PR companies and influencers “to create, amplify and launder content aligned with China’s political interests worldwide”,according to the EU’s diplomatic service. In 2024, researchers at Citizen Labuncovered 123 websites operating from China, purporting to be news outlets, which were disseminating pro-Beijing misinformation in 30 countries across Europe, Asia and Latin America.The stakes of foreign interference were underscored when Romania became the first EU member stateto annul an electionafter declassified intelligence revealed an alleged Russian campaign, including massive cyber-attacks on the electoral IT system and social media meddling in favour of an ultranationalist candidate. Authorities in Moldova, an EU candidate country,have also alleged Russian interference in recent elections, including massive vote-buying schemes and propaganda campaigns.EU could water down AI Act amid Trump and big tech pressureRead moreThe centre would be a hub for EU institutions and member states to share information and early warnings, as well as raising public awareness about foreign governments seeking to manipulate information.Participation in the centre would be voluntary for EU states and countries hoping to join the EU. The commission also suggests participation could be open to “like-minded partners”, raising the prospect of involvement for the UK, which is often described in such terms.Other elements of the democracy shield plan include the creation of an independent network of factcheckers, to protect against misinformation, especially during elections, health emergencies or natural disasters.Brussels also wants to see a voluntary network of internet influencers to raise awareness about EU rules on democratic and internet standards.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionSocial mediaEuropeDigital mediaUrsula von der LeyenCyberwarInternet safetynewsShareReuse this content"

In exchange, the university will share admissions data with the government, pay $30m and invest $30m more in research programs benefiting farmers – a reflection of the university’s longstanding record of agricultural research. Cornell also agreed to continue to “evaluate the campus climate”, particularly for Jewish students, and use the Trump administration’s interpretation of civil rights laws, which views diversity initiatives as unlawful race-based discrimination, in training materials.The administration’s deal with Cornell – a private, Ivy League university in upstateNew York– follows earlier ones with Columbia, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Virginia. Those agreements – in particular Columbia’s – drew widespread accusations of government overreach and criticism of universities’ “capitulation” to Trump’s bullying tactics in the service of his campaign to overhaul higher education in his ideological image.Move over, gender studies: the conservative tide coming for US universitiesRead moreThe deal comes as several universities have turned down an offer by the administration to join a “compact” that would grant them preferential access to federal funding in exchange for a series of concessions aligning university policy with the administration’s anti-diversity priorities. On Friday, hundreds of students and faculty across the country protested to call on university leaders to reject Trump’s compact and take a more forceful stance against the administration’sunprecedented assaulton universities’ independence.Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, hailed the settlement as a victory for the administration in its effort to “end divisive DEI policies”.“Universities are refocusing their attention on merit, rigor, and truth-seeking – not ideology,” she wrote in asocial media post.Cornell’s new president, Michael I Kotlikoff, defended the university’s decision and said that the deal allowed it to preserve its independence.“The agreement explicitly recognizes Cornell’s right to independently establish our policies and procedures, choose whom to hire and admit, and determine what we teach, without intrusive government monitoring or approvals,” he wrote in astatement. “In short, it recognizes our rights, as a private university, to define the conditions on our campuses that advance learning and produce new knowledge.”The Trump administration hasseized on allegationsof antisemitism on campus after mass student protests against Israel’s war in Gaza as a pretext to place dozens of universities under investigation, turninglandmark Title VI anti-discrimination legislationinto a tool to force universities into reforms that span well beyond tackling antisemitism.The education departmentfirst informedCornell that it was under investigation for alleged antisemitism shortly after 7 October 2023, when an anonymous complainant accused a professor there of spreading “hate and lies” and of supporting Hamas.The complaint was one of dozens submitted around that time which prompted the government to investigate universities and subsequently freeze funding. Critics havenotedthat those complaints often included no evidence or detail.“If the Trump admin had evidence that Cornell systemically discriminated against Jewish students in violation of Title VI, it wouldn’t let the university off the hook for a $30m investment in research about AI, robotics and farming,”saidJameel Jaffer, director of theKnight First Amendment Institute, referencing the agreement’s stipulation that the university would invest in agricultural programs “incorporating AI and robotics”.Still, the deal with Cornell appeared to be less severe than some feared it would be. Columbia, for example, agreed to take control of an academic department from its faculty and ban face masks, among other terms.“Today’s settlement, while unwarranted and punitive, nevertheless demonstrates the Trump administration’s attacks on students, staff and faculty are losing steam,” said Todd Wolfson, president of the American Association of University Professors. “We’ve already won widespread rejections of Trump’s absurd loyalty oath compacts and we’ll keep fighting until we win an education system that serves the public good, not a dangerously narrow far-right ideology that serves billionaires.”Explore more on these topicsUS universitiesUS politicsNew YorkTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The men warned that anyone interfering with the group would be a “target”, the judge said.Police evidence also includes a document described as a “manifesto” for the alleged extremist group.Pollock is charged with possessing an explosive substance, which relates to components for potential pipe bombs and incendiary devices allegedly found at his home. The Police Service of Northern Ireland carried out the search.Pollock was also charged, with Peckauskas, of possessing an explosive substance, which was described as four threaded pipe end caps and six litres of hydrogen peroxide, in Portlaoise.Det Declan O’Connor told the court that it was alleged that Pollock was planning a terrorist attack on behalf of a “rightwing extremist group”.Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandnewsShareReuse this content"

This must stop,” she said. “Ending all operational communication with the so-called Libyan Rescue Coordination Center is both a legal and moral necessity – a clear line against European complicity in crimes against humanity.”The organisations acknowledged that the decision could result in them facing fines, detentions and the confiscation of their rescue vessels.Giulia Messmer, of Berlin-based Sea-Watch, said: “It is not only our right but our duty to treat armed militias as such in our operational communication – not as legitimate actors in search-and-rescue operations.”In the past 10 years, rescue organisations operating in the Mediterranean have saved more than 155,000 people from drowning.In doing so, they have come under increased pressure; campaigners have criticised an escalatingcrackdownon them by Italy, where hardline rules have blocked vessels from leaving port for acollective totalof more than 700 days, while in August, Libya’s coastguardwas accusedof firing on a vessel belonging to SOS Méditerranée.A report published last month by Sea-Watchaccused the Libyan coastguard of 54 violent incidentssince 2016, including shootings, ramming vessels, and threatening and assaulting people in distress.The search-and-rescue organisations said this week that they had launched a new alliance, the Justice Fleet, whose website would track incidents involving the Libyan coastguard and compile information on legal cases pursued by the NGOs.The NGOs behind the alliance – the largest group of civil search-and-rescue organisations to date – described it as a means of pushing back against the escalating pressure they faced.“For 10 years, civil sea rescue has been providing first aid in the Mediterranean. For that, we have been blocked, criminalised, slandered,” the Justice Fleet websitesaid. “That’s why we are joining forces now, stronger than ever – to defend human rights and international maritime law together.”Explore more on these topicsRefugeesEuropeMigrationHuman rights (Law)Human rights (Global development)LibyaEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Musk’s fortune, which includes a stake of about 12.5% in Tesla, is already worth $461bn.“Musk isTeslaand Tesla is Musk,” says Dan Ives, a managing director at the US financial firm Wedbush. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”Trump reverses course to renominate billionaire Musk ally to lead NasaRead moreIves is a self-described Tesla “core bull” who nonetheless has consistently raised concerns about the damage that the chief executive’s political stance has been doing to one of the world’s best-known brands.Tesla sales suffered as Musk’s on-off relationship with Trump –funding his presidential campaignand his stintleading sweeping cutsat the “department of government efficiency” – damaged the appeal of its vehicles to a left-leaning consumer base.There were signs of trouble before that as well, with market research firm Strategic Vision recording a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Muskbought Twitter(now X) in 2022,rolled back content moderationon the platform andreinstated banned accounts.Other off-putting factors have been swirling around the Trump soap opera, such as reports of Musk’salleged extensive drug consumption, his public support forfar-right political partiesand makingfascist-style salutes at political rallies.At one point in March, Ives warned that Tesla and Musk were embroiled in a “brand tornado crisis moment” as the backlash against the boss’s behaviour became a global problem amid falling sales. Other factors were at play in Tesla’s commercial wobbles, not least stiff competition from Chinese-made vehicles, but Musk’s notoriety has had an impact.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shares in Tesla have risen by nearly two-thirds since May, when the Tesla chief executive announced he wasleaving the Trump administration(and then worrying investors by falling out with the president publicly). Third-quarter deliveries – a proxy for sales –trounced Wall Street estimates last monththanks to US consumers taking advantage of expiring federal tax credits for electric vehicles, although European sales suffered and analysts warned that Musk needs to cushion a post-credit slowdown by selling cheaper models.Another factor is the culture among US investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged and Jeff Bezos had a long reign at the top of Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Indeed, most Tesla shareholders seemed concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company, instead of wanting him to leave altogether.“Money talks in the US more,” says Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”Other incentives in Musk’s$1tn pay packageinclude delivering 20m Tesla vehicles, 10m self-driving car subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots and 1m robotaxis. These targets, particularly the robots and autonomous vehicles, require the kind of entrepreneurial and technological chutzpah that Musk has shown at Tesla and his rocket company SpaceX.Matthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst, says the added value Musk has brought to Tesla’s stock is “undeniable” and has made “many people rich, including himself”.However, Schmidt adds that Tesla’s core car business has reached its peak and describes the autonomous vehicle plans as “certainly not the best in the market”.“Have shareholders been naively blind-sided by past achievements rather than the foresight of future prospects? Perhaps!” he says.Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaTechnology sectorThe super-richCorporate governanceExecutive pay and bonusesAutomotive industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

Most obligations on companies developing high-risk AI systems that “pose serious risks to health, safety or fundamental rights” are not due to come into effect until August 2026 or a year after that.Global stock markets fall sharply over AI bubble fearsRead moreAccording to the Financial Times, the commission is considering giving a one-year “grace period” to companies breaching the rules on the highest-risk AI.Providers of generative AI – systems that can produce content, such as text or images – who have already placed products on the market before the implementation date could be granted a one-year pause from the laws “to provide sufficient time   … to adapt their practices within a reasonable time without disrupting the market”, stated an internal document cited by the FT.The commission is also considering delays to imposing fines for violations of its new AI transparency rules until August 2027 to “provide sufficient time for adaptation of providers and deployers of AI systems” to implement the obligations, the newspaper reported.Also being studied is greater flexibility for AI developers of high-risk systems over monitoring performance of products on the market, by allowing them to follow guidance that would be less prescriptive than the system originally envisaged, according to the specialist news site MLex, whichfirst reported on the planned amendmentsto the act.The proposals could change before their expected release on 19 November. Once published, they would then have to be agreed by EU member states and the European parliament.The EU has come under repeated pressure from the Trump administration to weaken regulation of tech companies. The US presidentrecently threatened to impose tariffson countries with tech regulations or digital taxes that he deemed to be “designed to harm or discriminate against American technology”.Meta announced this year that itwould not be signing the commission’s code of practice for general-purpose AI models.“Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI,” wrote the company’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, who contended that the code introduced “legal uncertainties” for model developers, as well as measures that went “far beyond the scope of the AI Act”.But it is not just US companies that have complained about Europe’s regulation of the fast-evolving technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The division, which has made shows including Love Island, I’m a Celebrity and the hit drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office, has been the subject of separate takeover talks.Confirmingovernight reports of talks, ITV told the market on Friday morning there could “be no certainty” about the terms of a potential sale, or whether the sale would even take place, adding: “A further announcement will be made in due course, if appropriate.”YouTube most popular first TV destination for children, Ofcom findsRead moreThe comments sent ITV’s share price up 16%, making it the top riser on the FTSE 250 index on Friday.Any deal combining the TV ad sales operations of ITV and Sky, giving Comcast potential control of more than 70% of the UK market, could prompt the competition regulator to intervene.Industry sources have said Sky may have to look at remedies, including relinquishing its third-party sales deals, which include representing ad sales for Channel 5 and Disney in the UK. That could require the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to reconsider how it measures the ad market to include digital advertising.“This is the biggest moment in ITV’s 70-year history, said Alex DeGroote, an independent media analyst. “It will completely change the UK broadcasting landscape.“And given ITV’s status as Britain’s biggest commercially funded, free-to-air public service broadcaster, a takeover by a US pay-TV operator makes the move not just a question for competition regulators, but also a politically sensitive one too.”He predicted a successful takeover would result in heavy job losses at ITV: “With duplication in many areas – from sales and management to news provision – if the deal goes through it will be a jobs bloodbath.”DeGroote suggested Comcast’s offer was not “particularly generous” at just three-quarters of the broadcasting arm’s annual revenues, suggesting it should match the full £2.1bn.Simon Davis, founder and chief executive of the independent media agency Walk-In Media, said the price reflected “the lesser growth opportunity of ad-funded broadcasting and ITV’s vastly reduced dominance overall”.Juliane Althoff, a film and TV lawyer and partner at media and entertainment law firm Simkins LLP, said the sale “would be anything but straightforward, not least because ITV’s entertainment arm forms a huge part of its public service broadcasting identity”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He and Reeves, his longtime friend and most righteous co-star of the Bill & Ted movies, had the idea for the revival three years ago and have been prepping ever since.View image in fullscreenAnthony Carrigan, Kaya Scodelario and Josh Gad in Adulthood.Photograph: Albert Camicioli/Signature EntertainmentAnd yet, on stage for the first time since he was a teenager, the 60-year-old actor had a moment of panic. “I was like: ‘Oh, holy shit! What if I’m wrong?” he says, perched on a velvet sofa in a lounge at the theatre, a few hours before he goes on again. “And I’m looking at Keanu, who’s in a similar state of terror. And – well, it would have worried me if either of us were like, ‘whatever.’”The show, of course, went on. Winter and Reeves, the beloved time-travelling slackers of yore reunited as befuddled buddies in timeless purgatory, are now a third of the way through their 16-week run. Winter looks relaxed, sipping tea, in a blue scarf, at once garrulous and introspective. He’s in favour of people feeling the precipitous fear of creative risk a little more. “One hundred percent. There should be a jumping-out-of-an-airplane [feeling] without, you know, jumping out of an airplane.”I know I can trust Keanu and he can trust me. There’s no bullshitWinter would know. As well as a return to Broadway, this season brings the release ofAdulthood, his first film as director in over a decade. (He also appears in the black comedy as a weirdo stoner.) A child actor turned movie star turned director and producer and prolific tech documentarian, Winter’s career has been fitful, searching and unconventional, full of sharp left turns and voracious curiosity. (On Godot, the New Yorker’s Helen Shawreported, accurately, that Winter’s “palpable intelligence drives the show.”) Returning to Broadway, where he made his debut at age 13, is a bit like closing a loop. “I’ve lived like three lifetimes since then. But now being backstage and doing my warm-ups, being in the wings and seeing the stagehands – it feels like I never left. It’s like a complete time-bend.”Waiting for Godot review – Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter’s unlikely reunionRead moreOne that is shared with Reeves, theeccentric, thoughtful yinto Winter’s quick and chatty yang, a “lifesaver” with whom Winter most recently appeared on-screen inBill & Ted Face the Music(2020). “I knew that this was a mammoth undertaking, and the only reason I felt we could pull it off was that it was the two of us together,” he says. Working with Reeves provides “an immediate sense of comfort. I know I can trust him and he can trust me. We genuinely have each other’s backs. There’s no bullshit.”View image in fullscreenAlex Winter (left) as Vladimir and Keanu Reeves as Estragon in Waiting for Godot, in New York.Photograph: Andy Henderson/APReeves and Winter, with ever-precise comic timing and inimitable chemistry, are the leaven in this bleak existentialist affair, lending lines such as “together again at last …” a jolt of sweetness – and indulging in a flourish of air guitar. Indeed, Winter says, performing with Reeves again “is like being in a band.” (The two both play bass.) “It’s this fluid give-and-take. Sometimes I’m cooking and he’s catching up. Sometimes I’m catching up and he’s cooking. Sometimes we’re helping each other out of a hole. Sometimes we’re just on a fucking groove and we look at each other and go: ‘God damn, that was good! Where the fuck did that come from?’”Vladimir and Estragon, two longtime friends with a vaudeville past, share qualities with the duo – particularly a “questioning of faith and life” – that have drawn them together since their early 20s. “We were both really into literature and drama, but also just like, what the fuck is this world? How do you live in it?” Winter laughs. How do you maintain artistic integrity and have a Hollywood career? How do you keep having fun? And, after the success of Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure in 1989, how do you be famous?By this point, Winter had already been acting over half his life. Born in England to two modern dancers, he first got on stage at age 10 in St Louis, Missouri; when he, aged 12, and his mother moved to New York following divorce, she got him a children’s talent agent. Within a month, he was on Broadway opposite Yul Brynner in The King and I. He spent most of his high school years in Peter Pan, playing John Darling next to Sandy Duncan.View image in fullscreenWinter in Joel Schumacher’s The Lost Boys (1987).Photograph: Jane O’Neal/Warner Bros/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockHere, he developed the trademark discipline of a child actor – a subject he later explored in his 2020 documentary Showbiz Kids – and lasting emotional scars from prolonged sexual abuse by an unnamed adult who, he says, has since died. The “nightmarish” experience, which he did notrevealpublicly until 2018, left him with “extreme PTSD” and mental fracturing that, as hetoldthe Guardian in 2020, got “worse and worse and worse.”He didn’t talk about it and kept working, – first an off-Broadway play, then commercials, then NYU film school, then an audition for Joel Schumacher’s vampire drama The Lost Boys. The director encouraged him to drop out. The part was small, but the movie, released in 1987, “totally changed my life”. A year short of graduation, he moved to LA.View image in fullscreenAir guitar at the ready … Winter and Reeves in Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (1989).Photograph: Orion/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockBy the time Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey sequel was released in 1991, Winter had already shifted focus, directing music videos and commercials and co-creating the Idiot Box, a late-night sketch series for MTV. In 1993, he co-wrote and co-directed the cult hit Freaked, in which he played a former child star who is kidnapped and turned into a mutant by Randy Quaid. By 26, he was “fried.” Winter dismissed his agents and decamped for New York, then London, where he formed a production company. “I just wanted to get the hell out of the public eye, and just be on the tube, going to my office in Soho and start a family,” he says. He found a therapist, and started confronting the trauma of abuse. He had three children, the youngest of whom is about to graduate high school in LA.And he began pursuing rangy nonfiction interests as a documentarian – firstNapster, the download site that revolutionised the consumption of music; then Bitcoin and the dark web; then the Panama Papers, Blockchain and the iconoclastic musicianFrank Zappa. His most recent documentary, 2022’s The YouTube Effect, traced the video sharing platform’s arc from cute novelty to conspiracy theory machine. “My career is where I want it, which is that I have the ability to do whatever interests me the most,” he notes sagely. “But I would not have been OK had I not split.”Adulthood, which Winter co-produced from a script by Michael MB Galvin, brings some of Winter’s prevailing concerns back into the realm of metaphor: two siblings, manchild Noah (Josh Gad) and strait-laced Megan (Kaya Scodelario), discover a literal skeleton in their parents’ basement, triggering a deadly spiral of bad decisions fuelled by fear of financial and reputational ruin. The film, says Winter, “is at heart about the unrelenting and unspoken impossibility of living in this culture today” and the “fallacy of the middle class” in countries, such as the US and the UK, that are actively hollowing it out.Winter has never been shy about his political affiliations. Earlier this year, he helped organise anti-MuskTesla Takedown protests– and is quick to tie the siblings’ absurd hijinks back to the larger US climate. In Adulthood, “stress can subtly shift you into immoral acts, which is very much about the times that we’re in, where people who were Bernie bros suddenly went Maga,” he says. The very online, pathetic Noah draws, in part, on Winter’s experience in the bowels of YouTube. “Having been around so many fanboy-type people because of my work, I feel like I know them very well,” he says. “I don’t have contempt for them, but I do think they need to grow up.”View image in fullscreenWinter (bottom left) and Jonathan Ward watch Sandy Duncan fly across the stage in a performance of Peter Pan in the 1970s.Photograph: Diana Walker/Getty ImagesWinter, long a chronicler of the internet’s maturation, now has his sights trained on AI. “I’ve been thinking about an AI doc for about five years, and it hasn’t been the right time because it’s moving so fast,” he says. During the writers’ and actors’ strikes, held in part over AI protections, Winter acted as an interlocutor of sorts, running Zoom consortiums for guild members with AI technologists, academics, copyright lawyers and patent experts. “Most of the criticism is really fucking dumb,” he says, “like people who are out there saying, ‘I’m a leader in the anti-AI charge, and we have to create this law or that’, and they just have no idea what they’re talking about and none of it is ever going to work.”He is not anti-regulation, more pro accurate and clear information, and certainly anti-huckster. “There’s a lot of smart people in this space,” with “good morals,” he says. (This does not, he notes, include OpenAI’s Sam Altman.) But “the reality of it is there will be an enormous amount of carnage on the way to things being OK. In every area, from Hollywood to climate to journalism, people are getting fired all over the place. They’re not getting replaced by a robot. They’re just not getting replaced.”Economic stress, job displacement, the rightward shift toward authoritarianism to solve the problems it can’t and won’t fix – it’s an old cycle, now playing out again, that brings us back to Godot, based in part on Beckett’s experience in the French resistance during the second world war. Winter returns to a question posed by Estragon in act I – “We’ve no rights any more?” – as the duo submit to waiting for no one. Vladimir answers: “We got rid of them.”“Every night, I say that line to Keanu: ‘We got rid of our rights,’” says Winter ruefully. “We were fucking idiots. We did it again.” And, as ever, the show goes on.Adulthood is available on digital platforms from 17 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmKeanu ReevesArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicsSexual harassmentChildreninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Here are her optionsWhile promoting new film Eternity, the actor outlined a specific end-of-life scenario that should be cold, wet and include one cheese shopStuart HeritageFri 7 Nov 2025 06.46 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 06.48 ESTShareOver the last few years, the promotional circuit for movie stars has transformed entirely. Where once you could expect sit-down interviews and hagiographic magazine profiles, now any time an actor makes a film they have to be subjected to a flurry of YouTube parlour games; eating weird sweets and trying to remember lines from their old films or, in the case of Hot Ones, willingly giving themselves diarrhoea.Now the goalposts have shifted again.Elizabeth Olsenwas recently at the premiere of her new movie Eternity, about a woman who has to pick a partner for the afterlife. And rather than hitting the usual circuit, Olsen has decided to promote the film by expressing her belief that she’s going to die alone.Actually, it’s a little weirder than that. Olsen doesn’t just think that she’s going to die alone; she thinks that she’s going to die alone in a very specific geographical location. Here’s the quoteshe gave to Varietyin full:When I was in high school, I dreamt of being a very old lady on the coast of England, alone actually. I might have had an animal, and it would be like foggy and wet and kind of cold, and I would go on long walks and I would be in a small town that had like one of each thing you need like one bakery, one coffee shop, one fishmonger, one cheese shop, one like community centre, one theatre. It was always just me because I like meeting new people and I like being a part of a community, and I always imagined I would die alone.Bizarrely, this is not the first time that Olsen has revealed this. When she appeared on Marc Maron’s podcast a year ago, she mentioned the whole “dying alone in England” thing, expanding on the theme by adding that she also assumes that she’ll have an affair with an old man.It’s fascinating but, as a format, “Famous person imagines their final days” probably doesn’t have the same pull as, say, Chicken Shop Date. It’s unlikely that Timothée Chalamet will try to promote Marty Supreme by expanding on the notion that one day he’s going to slip in the shower and his phone will be too far out of reach to call for help, or that Tom Holland will use the release of The Odyssey as a chance to tell everyone that he fears he’ll be unable to emotionally reconcile with his adult children from his deathbed.View image in fullscreenClose, but no cheese shop … Filey.Photograph: Darryl Gill/AlamyEven worse for Olsen, it’s unlikely that her dream will ever come true. She’s an in-demand A-list actor who lives in Los Angeles with her husband, so all manner of things will have to go wrong for her to end up an anonymous old lady pacing around the foggy English coast.Still, it wouldn’t hurt to lean into this fantasy a little by figuring out exactly where Olsen should die alone. We know it should be on the English coast, but that doesn’t exactly narrow things down, since England has thousands of miles of coastline.View image in fullscreenToo sunny … Eastbourne.Photograph: Johan Siebke/Stockimo/AlamyShe says she wants it to be foggy and wet and cold, which probably rules out a lot of the south. Although somewhere like Eastbourne sounds like it would be perfect, since the place is crammed to the gills with elderly people, it unfortunately receives more sunshine than almost anywhere else on the coast, and that’s clearly a big no-no for Olsen.The Guardian’s happiest places to live in Britain revealedRead moreFiley in North Yorkshire sounds like it would be a good bet – it’s certainly moody, and the sort of place where you could easily feel quite lonely – except that it doesn’t have a theatre or a cheesemonger. There’s always Berwick-upon-Tweed, which has The Maltings theatre and Doddington’s Dairy, but unfortunately it isoften cited as England’s happiest town, which doesn’t really bode well for anyone who longs to die alone.View image in fullscreenToo happy … Berwick-upon-TweedPhotograph: Handout/CommunityThere is, however, one town that fits the bill. It’s old, it’s cold, there’s a storied theatre anda specialist cheese shop. I’ve never been there without being drizzled on, and the entire place walks the difficult line between being relatively pretty and relatively depressing. That’s right, if Olsen really does intend to die alone in England, then Scarborough is the place to be. I’m sure the tourist board will be thrilled.Explore more on these topicsElizabeth OlsenHappinessfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But for many, the spotlight also turned to a name that had already long resonated on the global stage – his mother Mira Nair.A pioneering film-maker with a career spanning more than three decades, Nair has continually reshaped how south Asian identity is portrayed on screen. Now, with her son taking a major public office, the cultural legacy she built appears to echo in the next generation.Born in India and educated in Delhi and at Harvard, Nair has always straddled worlds. That cultural, geographic and emotional mix sits at the heart of her storytelling.View image in fullscreenPolitical vision … Shafiq Sayed and Chanda Sharma in Salaam Bombay!Photograph: Channel Four FilmsHer debut feature, Salaam Bombay! (1988),described by the Guardianas “fiercely unsentimental and throbbing with energy”, was a visceral portrait of life on the streets for India’s abandoned children, earning her instant recognition as a film-maker. It marked the start of a body of work that explores identity, migration and belonging with an unusual subtlety – issues that also lie at the heart of her son Mamdani’s political vision.The filmearned an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film – making it only the second Indian film to ever be up for an Academy Award – and won the Caméra d’Or (for debut directors) at Cannes, and became only the second Indian film ever nominated for an Oscar. Nair used the film’s proceeds to establish theSalaam Baalak Trust, a nonprofit that still provides support for street children in Delhi and Mumbai.Her 1991 follow-up,Mississippi Masala,starring a young Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury, was one of the earliest films to explore the racial complexities faced by Indian immigrants in America’s deep south. Centered on an interracial love story, it tackled themes of identity, displacement and belonging with rare sensitivity. The film cemented Nair’s reputation as a chronicler of cross-cultural lives and premiered at Venice, where it won the prize for best screenplay.That same fearless spirit drove her more provocative and globally diverse choices in the years that followed. In Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996), Nair explored female sensuality and agency in 16th-century India – a theme rarely addressed in Indian cinema.View image in fullscreenJoyous … Monsoon Wedding.Photograph: USA Films/AllstarBut it wasMonsoon Wedding(2001) that cemented her mainstream success. The vibrant family dramedy, set during a chaotic Delhi wedding, captured the tension between tradition and modernity with a joyous, unsentimental tone. It won the top prize – the Golden Lion – at Venice and became a global hit, especially in the UK, where its story of diaspora identity, arranged marriage, and familial dysfunction struck a chord with British south Asians.She followed it five years later with an adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri’sThe Namesake, a meditative film that followed an Indian-American family across decades. Quiet, contemplative and beautifully shot, the film stands as one of the most emotional explorations of cultural duality ever put on screen. Like her earlier work it focused on how it feels to live in two worlds and belong fully to neither.Nair’s 2012 adaptation of Mohsin Hamid’sThe Reluctant Fundamentalist– with Riz Ahmed as a Pakistani man imperilled in the US after 9/11 – was bold and provocative, while 2016’sQueen of Katwewas a nuanced but crowd-pleasing biopic of Phiona Mutesi, a chess prodigy from the slums of Kampala, Uganda.Nair’s work has long disrupted the stereotypes imposed on south Asians in cinema. Her characters are complex, her narratives expansive, defined by contradiction, intimacy and emotional truth. Though unapologetically political, her films avoid didacticism, letting her themes unfold through the language of family and memory.That same vision may have shaped her son’s political outlook. Mamdani, a former housing rights activist and state assemblyman, has spoken about the influence of his parents, particularly his mother’s emphasis on cultural rootedness and justice.Nair’s influence is not only cinematic but also civic and a form of cultural activism that brought dignity and humanity to marginalised lives. From street children and undocumented migrants to queer lovers and second-generation immigrants, her protagonists are never peripheral. They are the story.And even as she moved into new forms, directing opera, teaching, founding a film school in Kampala, Nair’s commitment to storytelling as empowerment has remained unwavering. Her most recent work, the seriesA Suitable Boy (2020), adapted from the Vikram Seth novel, was the first BBC series to feature an all-Indian cast.Now, as the city of New York welcomes a mayor who represents a new kind of American leadership, young, brown, Muslim it’s hard not to see the through-line. Long before her son ever canvassed a street in Queens, Nair was laying the groundwork for a more inclusive cultural landscape one film at a time. Mamdani paid tribute to that legacy: “To my parents, mama and baba: You have made me into the man I am today. I am so proud to be your son.”Explore more on these topicsMira NairZohran MamdanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, she is reworking Dickens’s classic – with an Asian ScroogeFri 7 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 09.14 ESTShareTo begin with, Gurinder Chadha was wandering through theCharles DickensMuseum in London, trying to commune with the author’s spirit. “If you were alive today,” the film-maker asked him, “what story would you tell?” And, she wondered in the same breath: “What can I bring as my own vision to this wonderful story of yours?”While Dickens’s ghost didn’t materialise, she found her answers and, during lockdown, wrote her own version of his ghost story A Christmas Carol. Giving it the title Christmas Karma, the 65-year-old Londoner has created an energetic, flamboyant musical film starring The Big Bang Theory’s Kunal Nayyar as Mr Sood – her modern-day Scrooge – alongside Eva Longoria, Billy Porter and Boy George as the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. The rest of the cast is stacked like decorations on a Norway spruce, with Hugh Bonneville, Danny Dyer and Pixie Lott further illuminating proceedings.With the kind of coincidence Dickens revelled in, the film-maker switched on the TV news to find inspiration for the miser who drains the joy from everyone around him. “There’s an interesting phenomenon of Asians in the Tory party empowered by taking a hard rightwing stance,” Chadha says. “In a way it’s them wanting to be accepted more – which is kind of what my Scrooge does. He thinks money will give him status and protect him. People would ask me to come and support them, and I would say: ‘No, I can’t. Even though you’re an Asian woman and I’m an Asian woman, that’s where it stops.’”View image in fullscreenIn the spirit … Danny Dyer and Gurinder Chadha on the set of Christmas Karma.Photograph: True BritIt makes you wonder whether those politicians, whom Chadha won’t mention by name, had ever actually seen any of her eight feature films, which have been gently – and sometimes riotously – dismantling stereotypes since 1993. “My stories say we all have varied cultural leanings and are empowered by different things,” she says.Born in Kenya to Indian Sikh parents, Chadha was two when civil unrest led the family to move to Britain in the 1960s. “I never lived in India, so Southall is my home town,” she says of the west London enclave, where she witnessed the myriad perspectives fracturing the so-called Asian community. That would feed into her films: her debut, Bhaji on the Beach – about a women’s outing to Blackpool – sees the day-trippers clash over what counts as “respectable behaviour”. InViceroy’s House, Hindus, Muslims and Sikh workers split along political as much as religious lines. InBlinded By the Light, as in her best-known filmBend It Like Beckham, the central conflict is not East v West but fathers and their children.The long entanglement between Britain and India shapes the way Chadha thinks about identity today. “My storytelling doesn’t start in modern day London; it began hundreds of years ago with Queen Elizabeth I granting the East India Company a monopoly to go to India, where British immigrants began the economic plunder that fuelled industrial Britain – telling the truth of that part of Britishness shaped by the diaspora.”If you put a person of colour in the lead in a British film, 90% of the industry backs awayConsequently, having Asian leads in adaptations of It’s a Wonderful Life (It’s a Wonderful Afterlife), Pride and Prejudice (Bride and Prejudice) and now Dickens feels entirely natural: “To see a character you don’t expect in that setting is to open up the world – and that story – in new ways.”On an overcast summer’s day, I visit the Christmas Karma set, on location in a picturesque street in Camden Town, north London, witnessing the pivotal moment when her Scrooge – or Sood – glimpses the Cratchits’ Christmas table and overhears what the ailing Tiny Tim really thinks of him. What the Dickens prose never accounted for was this: a gay African American Ghost of Christmas Present in a sparkly emerald three-piece suit; Bob Cratchit (Leo Suter) leading his wife Mary (Pixie Lott) in a guitar-led ballad; and a director crouched on a narrow staircase, eyes darting between the monitor and the mayhem. “That scene was tough for Kunal,” she says when we speak later. “You can’t have Sood soften too soon – one misplaced smile at the end of a line can ruin the journey.”Capturing the right mood drives the film-maker, especially in today’s divided Britain. She notes that Dickens is widely believed today to have had bipolar disorder and would have been “destroyed by the disparity between the wealthy and poor”, she explains. “He’s trying to figure out why people can be mean and selfish.” While editing the film she was struck by a line where the Ghost of Christmas Present asks: “Is one CEO worth a thousand Tim Cratchits?” Even though it wasn’t intended as a direct allusion, “I thought, people will assume I mean Elon Musk and the rise of the [tech] CEOs,” she says.View image in fullscreenWhat the Dickens … a scene from Christmas Karma.Photograph: True BritGathering a cast of this magnitude would be like Christmas for most British film-makers, but such is Chadha’s global stature that actors dream up ways of catching her eye. Eva Longoria invited her to host a screening ofFlamin’ Hot, her own directorial debut. Over dinner, the Desperate Housewives star told Chadha she’d love to work with her, and Chadha told her about Christmas Karma. Longoria was adamant that she should be a ghost. “She said: ‘I’m Mexican – we own ghosts. Day of the Dead. Hello?’” Chadha says it was a lightbulb moment; she went home and rewrote the part, finding a British mariachi band to back her up.The emphasis in Chadha’s films – and in the way she carries herself off camera – is always on fun, which is perhaps why the British film industry underrates her. In the past 30 years, only Steve McQueen, as a British director of colour, has been as consistent or as successful. Bend It Like Beckham was released in every country in the world. “Even North Korea,” she chimes. Yet, like Nancy Meyers in the US – another film-maker who makes popular, female-centric movies – she often finds herself underappreciated and condescended to.“Whatever they see me as, I don’t see myself as that,” Chadha says of British film executives. “The amount of money I’ve made for the British film industry is enormous. People want me to make bleeding-heart films about suffering Asian women and racism. I could make searingly political films, but who’s going to watch them? People who read Sight and Sound? Another reason my films aren’t taken seriously is that people don’t value women.

By the end, he said: ‘You know what, I want to help Gurinder and people like Gurinder.’ And he did. Afterwards, people looked at me differently. Producer Andy Paterson still says: ‘Oh my God, that speech.’” When we speak, she’s on her way to India as part of a trade mission aimed at strengthening Britain’s ties with the country.Is the world Chadha depicts in her movies under threat from the rise of Reform UK, with its mantra that immigration is out of control, British culture has been eroded, and the country has become hostage to wokeness? She dismisses the notion. “Reform are a minority; we have to remember that,” she says. “While I understand the idea of trying to protect your cultural identity, there’s no room for hatred or racism from anyone, on any side, of any colour.”Rather, she sees the climate as an opportunity for her diaspora-centred movies. “There are enough people unhappy with what’s happening politically who will find the film a soothing balm,” she says. “One reason Bend It Like Beckham was so popular was that it came out after 9/11. The world was traumatised and unsure where to turn – then came this sweet, innocent film celebrating different cultures.” She sent the internet into raptures recently with the announcement that she’s working on a sequel to that most beloved of football films. “With the rise of women’s football, I’ve been persuaded to revisit the story and imagine what they’d all be doing today,” she teases.Her creative team already has a star consultant in the shape of the United States and former Chelsea Women’s manager Emma Hayes. “We went for a curry the other day – she’s from Camden, where I live,” Chadha recalls. “It started with her fangirling me when we first met, saying she was Keira Knightley and cried her eyes out when the film ended. Now I’m talking to her about the business side of football, about the struggles and successes she’s had. I’m doing my due diligence.“It’s so loved I don’t want to do any old shit,” she adds. “Unless I have something to say, I won’t say it.”Christmas Karma is in UK cinemas from14 November.Explore more on these topicsGurinder ChadhaCharles DickensinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Where do the Star Trek movies go from here?Ben ChildOne of the new Paramount ownership’s first acts has been to end the Chris Pine/Zachary Quinto series of Trek movies. But surely they can’t stop making them forever?Fri 7 Nov 2025 08.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 12.48 ESTShareThere have been many Star Treks over the decades. First up we had a 1960s morality play performed on cardboard sets; then it became a billion-dollar movie saga about space diplomacy. More recently we’ve been gifted an ever-expanding collection of streaming spinoffs, each one more determined than the last to prove itself the true keeper of the sacred flame. Now we have a franchise that no longer has any idea what to do with itself.According to Variety, its producer Paramount has shelved the most recent film trilogy, known unofficially as the “Kelvin-verse”, that starred Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. What comes next is anyone’s guess.Perhaps the more pertinent question here might be whether this grand old sci-fi saga is now really suited for the big screen at all. The recent films – 2009’sStar Trek, 2013’sStar Trek Into Darkness, and 2016’sStar Trek Beyond– won critical plaudits, yet were also criticised by fans for trying to turn a utopian thought experiment about empathy, cooperation and the perils of militarism into a knockabout space opera.The JJ Abrams-led trilogy was well acted, usually well-plotted (apart from the odd moment of Khan-related identity crisis in the middle movie) and featured some spectacular set pieces: the segue in which Kirk and his crew blow up a squadron of enemy drones to the soundtrack of the Beastie Boys’ Sabotage has few equals in modern blockbuster cinema. And yet here we are, 16 years on, and with not much to show for it other than a stack of unused sequel scripts –Kirk’s dad being inexplicably alive was briefly considered.On the small screen, Kirk and Spock are not even played by Pine and Quinto any more, as the Paramount+ sagaStrange New Worldsharks back unapologetically to the early, Apollo-era optimism of the 1960s original series. (In fact, Kirk isn’t even the captain of the Enterprise yet). Could Strange New Worlds eventually transition to the big screen? It’s more than possible, and the series has cleverly blended Shatner-era earnestness with modern streaming swagger. And yet it’s hard to imagine a show whose best moments include Spock accidentally getting engaged during shore leave and a full musical episode set entirely in space making the leap to cinema without losing something in the process.Personally I love the show, but trying to shoehorn its gentle emotional chaos into 120 minutes of blockbuster spectacle could be counterproductive. So where else could Paramount look?Variety’s report hangs heavily on the supposed political power shift at the studio, which has seen Top Gun: Maverick II, Call of Duty: The Movie and even a sequel to Days of Thunder being mooted, as new Trump-ally CEO David Ellison looks toward greenlighting the kind of material that red-state America adores. That approach doesn’t seem to make any sense at all forStar Trek, which made history for the first interracial kiss on mainstream US television and has been optimistically “woke” ever since. It’s hard to see how that sits beside a studio slate obsessed with fighter jets and militaristic patriotism.The truth is that Star Trek always represented a quiet form of rebellion. It was always obsessed with the joys of interstellar coexistence and the power of cosmic diplomacy, turning moral quandaries and sentient holograms demanding civil rights into primetime drama. Yet the very optimism that once made the saga radical now appears to have made it politically unfashionable. It’s the final irony: the one franchise that still believes in the future can’t find a future for itself.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekStar Trek (Culture)Star Trek (Film)Star Trek Into DarknessTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

The studio didn’t just maintain a robust production line that won over both critics and crowds, they also managed to change our concept of what animation could achieve as an art form. Radically expansive visuals were matched with surprising, weighty ideas, conjuring the kind of magic that had been largely absent from Disney’s output in the years prior.Train Dreams review – Joel Edgerton superb in Malickian story of trees, grief and railroadsRead moreWhile many blamed the ensuing fade on Covid, in truth it had already started before then. Like the rest of the industry, the company had become overly reliant on sequels, with the four years before 2020 seeing one original versus four follow-ups and as cinemas shuttered, their latest offering, Onward, was middling enough to suggest that even superfans should be concerned about the future. It’s been a case of ongoing underwhelm ever since, a low point reached by this year’s Elio, a patchworked mess that had the lowest opening ever for a Pixar film (their only bright spot Inside Out 2 has left their upcoming slate looking predictably sequel-heavy).It’s hard not to see Netflix’s pre-Thanksgiving adventure In Your Dreams as an attempt to fill the gap both visually and thematically, the film sticking closely to the Pixar playbook. It’s not up to their one-time standard, but it’s more engaging than the average streaming cartoon and a damn sight better than what Netflix gave us last year, the remarkably uglySpellbound, which tried and miserably failed to give us a Disney princess copycat.In Your Dreams is more reminiscent of Inside Out with shades of Coco; a quest narrative that takes place in a world close to our own, in this instance the world of dreams. Like Spellbound, it’s also a tale of children trying to deal with parents whose marriage is on the rocks, a never not relevant or welcome conversation to introduce and assist with. Stevie is a girl whose dreams are of better days, when the family dynamic was operating as it should (“like one of those happy families you see at the beginning of a disaster movie” she says) but even her consciousness knows that something is wrong, turning her dreams into nightmares and bringing her back to the less idyllic real world. A rather convoluted set of circumstances leads her and younger brother Elliot to a book about the Sandman who can allegedly turn dreams into reality and with their mother threatening to leave the family home for a new job, the pair are propelled into a journey inside their minds.The aesthetic of In Your Dreams, especially that of the human characters, is so unavoidably Pixar-coded that it would feel shameless were it not the brainchild of Alex Woo, the writer-director who was once a story artist on many of their defining titles, including Ratatouille and Wall-E. This is still very much theNetflixmockbuster version of that but it’s considerably more convincing than many of their junkier lower-tier efforts. Woo and co-writer Erik Benson, another ex-Pixar bod, do a decent enough job of trying to also bring with them the same style of script – life lessons delivered without a heavy hand woven into a dynamic caper – and while their trademark emotional soar never arrives, there are worthy observations here.Like in Inside Out, where we were taught that sadness must exist alongside happiness, here we’re told that nightmares can help strengthen us in the same way that dreams can lead to inspiration. It’s not exactly groundbreaking but it has more texture than a simple “family is important” message and along with the relatively rare decision to give a brother-sister relationship priority, it helps to slightly distinguish this from the pack. What they can’t quite transfer is the wit, the film coming up short when it tries to amuse rather than teach us. An inevitable sidekick, this time a stuffed toy come to life voiced by Craig Robinson, is aggressively unfunny while the various snapshots of dream worlds are lacking in anything truly silly enough to make us smile.Woo, though, is a talent that Netflix would be wise to keep in its animated stable and with a stronger script and less derivative concept (there are also notes of Coraline in here), one could imagine something better in his future. At a runtime that almost pushes it into more of an extended episode than a movie (advertised as 90 but finishing at under 80), this is a little too slight and breezy to really make much of an impression, like a dream you’ll forget as soon as you open your eyes.In Your Dreams is now showing at select cinemas and will be released on Netflix on 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsAnimation in filmNetflixComedy filmsAction and adventure filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

She revisits her spiritual breakthroughs, and explains why we need forgiveness instead of cancel cultureLaura SnapesFri 7 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 10.54 ESTShareRosalía Vila Tobella is just as bored as you are of pop music functioning as gossip column fodder, with lyrics full of hints of rivalries and betrayal. “I’m tiring of seeing people referencing celebrities, and celebrities referencing other celebrities,” she says. “I’m really much more excited about saints.”The 33-year-old Catalan musician and producer’s monumental fourth album, Lux, draws on the lives of dozens of female saints, inspired by “feminine mysticism, spirituality” and how lives of murder, materialism and rebellion could light the way to canonisation. Rosalía reels them off. Her gothic, operatic new single Berghain borrows from the 12th-century German abbess Hildegard of Bingen (cited like Madonnathese days by experimental female musicians). “She had these visions that would pierce her brain. There’s also Vimala, who wrote poetry but was a prostitute, and she ended up becoming a saint because she was one of the first women who wrote in the Therīgāthā,” an ancient Buddhist poem collection written by nuns.Santa Olga de Kyiv, who lived in the 10th century, converted to Christianity, Rosalía continues. “She was considered a saint because she brought so many people to that religion. But she was an assassin – when her husband was killed, she, out of revenge, killed a lot of men. It’s crazy that person can become a saint. In different religions, contexts, cultures, sainthood is understood so differently.”Rosalía makes a great case for an alternative career as a lecturer; if she wasn’t a pop star, she says, she “would be in college trying to study theology or philosophy”. (Her breakout album, 2018’s El Mal Querer, was her flamenco degree thesis – probably the first time anyone’s received academic honours and Pitchfork’s best new music accolade for one project.) Meeting in a central London hotel room in mid-October, she looks quite saintly, with her waist-length dark hair, the faintest shimmer of makeup and a pale grey long-sleeved jersey dress: quiet luxury via the convent. She speaks softly, reverently, with precision, her assistant nearby to help with translation, though she barely needs it. You do need her guidance to follow the traces of these saints in Lux, which may more obviously be interpreted as a fearsome confrontation of ex-lovers and critical detractors.Lux is 18 tracks long, features lyrics in 13 languages, two choirs, Patti Smith reading a poem, Björk and the London Symphony Orchestra, and takes further inspiration from the Ukraine-born Brazilian novelist Clarice Lispector and the French philosopher Simone Weil. It’s an exhilarating, towering listen, and leaves behind the South American club sounds of 2022’s aggressively playful Motomami to centre Rosalía’s classical flamenco training: the former scholar twisted the tradition through avant garde electronic production on her first two albums, 2017’s Los Ángeles and El Mal Querer. Everything she’s done has prompted accusations of cultural appropriation – flamenco being the province of Andalusian Gypsies, reggaeton and dembow as Latin American and Caribbean traditions. The culturally voracious Lux also feels like a provocation, underscored by Rosalía’s mastery of its many disciplines: a monomaniacal flex at critics and pretenders by a virtuoso who can rap menacingly in Latin and execute flawless pop iconography. The week after we meet, shegets a halo dyed into her hair.When writing, Rosalía had a world map on her wall with pins marking the stories of each saint she discovered. “It was like a huge puzzle,” she says. “There’s so much more that I couldn’t fit in. My love is plural and infinite, and it’s about trying to fit as much as I can so everybody could feel welcome when they hear this album.” Some listeners may question exactly what statement she’s making by singing in Hebrew and Arabic; her PR instructs me not to ask about politics, and Rosalía explains that those passages simply reference the Sufi mystic Rabia and the prophet Miriam.View image in fullscreen‘It’s the most fulfilling when you can stop being yourself …’ Rosalía.Photograph: Noah P DillonBeing a performer, she says, is about “being able to be a channel, a vessel. It’s the most fulfilling when you can stop being yourself. When I see artists like Nick Cave seem to embody otherness, I really admire that. Nowadays, more than ever, I feel like it’s necessary to understand the other. In a world that sometimes feels so divided, for me it’s about collecting stories and making songs out of that the best I can, because it’s the love for the other that allows me to do an album like this.”What also allowed Rosalía to make an album like this is her unique status. No matter what her critics make of her globe-straddling approach, the exacting study she puts into it, and the supreme execution, are irreproachable. “I always try to find ways to keep learning,” she says. Although she’s learning French and German on Duolingo, she spent a year working with native speakers to get the Lux translations right, including Charlotte Gainsbourg and Justice for the French parts; she also took piano lessons for the first time since she stopped tuition at 16. Equally irreproachable is her pop cultural nous: filming a role for season three of HBO’s Euphoria, modelling for Calvin Klein, being pappedtaking a bouquet of cigarettesto Charli xcx’s birthday party. On stage onthe bravura Motomami tour– probably the decade’s best – Rosalía always had an invasive cameraman on her trail, a comment on voyeurism amplified by the portrait-mode big screens, themselves a sharp reflection on how phones shape our perspective. Rosalía has mastered the sort of celebrity that buys you three years to make an album about God, transcendence and absolution, blowing the budget several times over.Rosalía – Berghain feat Björk & Yves TumorShe estimates that she produced 97% of Lux alone. “It probably is the most demanding album I’ve ever tried to do,” she says. She made it in Los Angeles, far from her family and home in Barcelona: “The solitude, the isolation, it’s pretty hard to deal with.” But her work requires that kind of asceticism. “I consider myself pretty social, but to do something like this, there’s no other way – it takes a lot of simplifying the day, doing barely nothing but this.” To write, she has to lie in bed. “It comes much easier when you let it come to you and make the space to try to erase yourself and disappear.”Much as Rosalía would rather disappear into the heady Lux, all the beatification stuff evidently shrouds a classic breakup album. I am also told not to ask about relationships: in 2023, Rosalía and Puerto Rican reggaeton star Rauw Alejandro ended their engagement, months after releasing a loved-up joint EP. On Rosalía’s rhapsodic new song La Perla, she indicts “un terrorista emocional”. “Mejor hablar / Ahora que / Callarme para siempre,” [“I’d rather speak now than forever hold my peace”] she sings on Focu ‘Ranni – a likely callback to El Mal Querer’s Que No Salga la Luna, sung as the abusive groom of the 13th-century Occitan text Flamenca that inspired the album: “Si hay alguien que aquí se oponga / Que no levante la vo’” (“if someone objects, may they not raise their voice”). Another saint she cites,la santuzzaRosalia, called off her wedding the day before the planned ceremony to live as a hermit.This may be one experience that attracted Rosalía to the stories of women who transcended their circumstances – though she’s not about to bring it up. A master of saying exactly what she wants and nothing more, she demurs when asked if searching for spiritual guidance inspired Lux: “Definitely, like all humans.” After a moment of silence that we try to psych each other into filling, she shares examples from her past.View image in fullscreenRosalía’s Motomami world tour in Santiago, Chile, 2022.Photograph: Alberto Valdés/EPAAged 16, she had vocal cord surgery to fix damage from her enthusiastic, untutored singing. “I couldn’t speak for a month – that was very strange, like this fasting of speaking, and then a year of vocal rehabilitation,” she says. “It took me so many years to really feel like I could actually use my instrument.”At 19, she spent 32 days alone walking the 500-mile Camino de Santiago across northernSpain, affirming her instincts for devotion and defiance.“Somebody in my family said, you won’t be able to do it because you’re not prepared physically. But I found really good people throughout the way that helped me, and I learned that if I could do this, I could do other things.” A decade later, the pandemic left her isolated in Florida for two years as she made Motomami.For Rosalía, faith was one way through these trials: the religiosity on Lux isn’t window dressing. “I pray every night before I fall asleep,” she says. “It’s a very personal relationship with God.” Her grandmother and namesake would take Rosalía and her sister Pilar to church as kids. “She is very Catholic,” says Rosalía. “I remember the ritual of it – the beauty of everybody holding hands, no matter who was beside you, and the singing. I really lovela communiónthat’s generated when humans gather, and they project themselves towards something that is bigger than them.” She reads the Bible as much as she can. “I really like San Mateo [the gospel of Matthew]. Everything he says, I think it’s bars”, she says, likening Bible verse to rap lyrics.Perfect reverence isn’t Rosalía’s style. “I know that I was made to divinise,” she sings in English on Divinize, likening her vertebrae to rosary beads; Reliquia (relic) makes you think of how she cut off a lock of hair to give to a fan each night on the Motomami tour. God Is a Stalker embodies his first-person perspective; the album’s wild array of languages suggests godlike omniscience. On the cartoonish yet seething Novia Robot (“Robot Girlfriend”), Rosalía decries men who want women to be pliant and emotionless, and sings that she’s “guapa para Dios” – hot for God. She says she always second guesses herself when toying with symbolism, “but that’s something I have to deal with. The beauty of art is putting things on the table and proposing questions, and probably finding more questions than answers – but playfulness is important in order to create.”It feels inevitable that Rosalía will encounter more criticism for Lux. Some fans are disappointed at her telling Le Monde that locking away her phone to focus on recording meant she wasn’t engaged with the conflicts in Palestine and Ukraine (though in response to a fashion designer who questioned her silence on Palestine, she condemned the conflict and said: “I do not see how shaming ourselves is the best way to keep the right moving forward for Palestine’s freedom”). Other criticisms now just seem like occupational hazard: scroll her social media profiles and you’ll see quite a shocking, absurd level of scrutiny and disapproval in the comments.The beauty of art is putting things on the table and proposing questions, and probably finding more questions than answers“I see a lot of this cancel culture happening in general, in internet, for everyone,” she says when I ask if she feels misunderstood. “That is always strange to me. I think there’s a need of much more culture of forgiveness. I wouldn’t cancel a friend because we think different. And definitely, I always feel like I have so much to learn and I always try to do things better. But at the same time, I like a lot something that Barthes said [about] the ‘anti-hero … who can bear contradiction without shame’. We all have contradictions. It’s impossible not to in a world as imperfect and contradictory as the one we live in. So I try to stay connected with what my mission is, which is to make music from the most loving place possible.”Much Spanish media started to turn against Rosalía when she introduced pop to flamenco; she encountered more criticism for the sexualised lyrics on Motomami, and for her thirst-trappy social media presence. There’s a respectability trap for women that the sanctified Lux mocks.“I deal with that by remembering who inspires me,” says Rosalía. “Irreverent women like Joan of Arc, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, Patti Smith, Cher – divas. They carry the weight and they …supportan.” She hunches under an imagined weight. “Endure. And so that is my inspiration. What I love about them is that they are unapologetic about what they want and what they do, what their path is. That’s a guide, un faro – a lighthouse. Through time, diva has had this negative connotation. But nowadays I don’t feel like it has the same way, and I celebrate women that are unapologetic and that do their path.”View image in fullscreenRosalía at Primavera Sound in Madrid, 2023.Photograph: Mariano Regidor/Redferns for ABAShe won’t say whether she feels like a diva – “that’s something that you can maybe answer” – but she’s more emphatic on the demands for her to apologise. “I think that whoever hears my music and my way of making music, they know that it comes from the love of trying to learn and share. I think people know my intention.”Rosalía: Lux review – a demanding, distinctive clash of classical and chaos that couldn’t be by anyone elseRead moreRosalía may be a little naive about politics and relying on the pureheartedness of her musicianship – but her frankly peerless work makes it easy to overlook those qualms, throwing up clashes that are as thrilling as they are edifying if you engage on her level. She talks about Berghain. On this song about dissolving to accommodate a lover’s fear and anger, Björk singing about the need for “divine intervention” is swiftly followed by a different incarnation of the idea, Yves Tumor reprising Mike Tyson’s 2002 tirade at Lennox Lewis: “I’ll fuck you ‘til you love me.”Many have assumed the song is named after the Berlin techno club – the made-up word is a portmanteau of neighbourhoods Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain – though Rosalía says she’s drawing on the technical translation, mountain grove. “We all have this forest of thoughts inside us where you could get lost,” she says. “I’m not glorifying evil, but darkness is present in life. It makes me think of a quote I really like: ‘The artist who walks beside the devil, putting a hand on his shoulder, can expand our understanding of wickedness.’ I agree so much. Sometimes, when you put opposites beside each other, you can understand both better.” Lux is Latin for light. “There had to be passages that were darker in order for the light to be even brighter.”Lux is out now on Columbia"

No other acoustic instrument pierces and shakes the air in quite the same way.Composer-performers such as Kali Malone, Jonny Greenwood, Ellen Arkbro, Sarah Davachi and Kit Downes are just the start. An experimental organ culture has grown in the UK thanks to events likeOrgan Reframedat Union Chapel in London (which over the past decade has commissioned music from composers including Mark Fell, Éliane Radigue and Hildur Guðnadóttir) and the fantastically named Bristol concert series Mainly Slow Organ Music, as well as adventurous organists such as James McVinnie.Infinity Gradient is the latest in a growing canon of initially serene organ music that later reveals depth and grit. An hour-long piece for organ and 100 loudspeakers, it was composed in 2021 by New York-based composer Tristan Perich, and performed with McVinnie at London’s Royal Festival Hall in 2024. After an opening flourish, the piece is arranged in seven sections but, in essence, it works through a handful of stretched crescendos.Perich’s breathing, warping electronics feel like a natural addition to the organ’s already extensive sound palette. His textures move surprisingly quickly through moods; oscillating figures morph from Caterina Barbieri to Baba O’Riley. Drones, pulses and scratchy hums form the base of this musical language, to which the organ adds layer after imposing layer. The moment when the full organ kicks in (with four massive subwoofers to boot) is well worth the wait.Hugh MorrisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenA master craftswoman … Waterbaby.Photograph: Levi AxenneWaterbaby – Beck n CallSinging of hopeless infatuation, the Swedish Sub Pop signee deploys one of the best piano riffs we’ve heard in ages, a head-nodding shuffle that melts into a string arrangement later on: masterful craft.Underscores – Do ItA key collaborator onthe new Danny Brown album, the hyperpop star threads Timbaland-era Justin Timberlake through a taut, terrific track made for earnest 00s MTV dance moves.Mssingno – Think of MePairing a Brandy sample with a UKG beat isn’t the most original idea, but then again Mssingno is the master of these ghostly nostalgic reworks – and the chorus is pure sad-banger rapture.Mala & Magugu – Militant DonIt’s been rattling around sets by Four Tet, Skream and more for a while, and now this chunk of classic dubstep lands on the general public with thudding force, further enlivened by Magugu’s Flowdan-style chatter.Nothing – Cannibal WorldA heaving, bending mass of shoegaze guitars and wafty dream-pop singing is churned up by junglist breakbeat: an absolutely inspired concept from the Philly band.JBee – If I Lose (ft Kidwild)Over pink-sunset drill production from DCBeats, JBee glumly reflects on the relentlessness of the grind, while Kidwild – capping a superb year – lets himself be vulnerable: “I just want you to hold me.”B​eau Mahadev – SuckerLeading off the NYC electronic producer’s atmospheric debut album, Subterra, a tech-house melody ripples like a tropical fish through a cavern; fans of Erika de Casier will love the vocals, too.Ben Beaumont-ThomasSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify – or use the playlist URL to transfer it toApple,Tidalor other services.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistExperimental musicClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Around a third of them are recorded for the first time, several are settings of German poetry that Clarke wrote as a student in London; some show her feeling her way towards her own sound, but the best – for example, the quietly imaginative Aufblick – are already distinctive.Her mature style is dark, expansive and melodic, with a storytelling sensibility that shines in The Seal Man and then Binnorie, an extended setting of a Scottish ballad discovered only after Clarke’s death, recorded here with a solo part for viola, Clarke’s own instrument. Max Baillie switches to violin for some lively folk song settings; another highlight is Daybreak, a setting of half a dozen lines by John Donne in which tenor and string quartet form five equally eloquent voices.The performers are persuasive, with Whately in particular on superb form, her voice laser-focused and glowing.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

And none of us wants tonotwrite about it.”The profound inner conflict of the three narrators begins on page two of The Mushroom Tapes and never quite resolves, lingering as an ethical tension that colours almost every page.‘Only you know why’: how mushroom murderer Erin Patterson faced her sentencingRead moreFour months on fromthe guilty verdict, Helen Garner, Chloe Hooper and Sarah Krasnostein, three of Australia’s most acclaimed writers, appear to have made their peace with the queasy ambivalence that plagued them while covering the Erin Patterson case; an ambivalence that was not shared by the global media as it covered the sensational 10-week trial.Have we all reached saturation point by now? Have we devoured enough of the tale about a dish wonderfully described in The Mushroom Tapes as the “flamboyantly retro” beef wellington? The elusive food dehydrator? The fake cancer? The fake cat? Here we are, still turning the page, still clicking the headlines, still asking:what was she thinking?Speaking to Guardian Australia, Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein continue to dissect and digest the case. As Krasnostein puts it, “There’s still daylight between the puzzle pieces.”“At first, we were seriously considering that this might have been a great injustice … not in terms of total innocence, but we were open that maybe it wasn’t quite what it looked like, and maybe there was some explanation for this behaviour,” she says. “And then I think, as the trial progressed, it became more and more clear that this was perhaps far less complex than we had imagined. And also, I think, complex in other ways that we hadn’t anticipated.”View image in fullscreenHelen Garner, Sarah Krasnostein and Chloe Hooper.Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianWhile covering another criminal trial that transfixed the world six decades earlier, philosopher Hannah Arendt famously coined the chilling phrase“the banality of evil”. There was no grand passion, no financial ruin, no clear revenge plot behind the Patterson murders; only a series of petty lies, poor choices and escalating deceptions. Ultimately, Hooper concludes, Patterson’s decision to poison four members of her estranged husband’s family wasn’t driven by coherent motive but the friction of ordinary life – a kind of mundane, self-absorbed indifference, far more difficult to comprehend than outright malice. The banality of evil indeed.The unconventional and collaborative structure of The Mushroom Tapes coalesced from the logistical and ethical complexity of covering the trial, the trio tell Guardian Australia. The book is not a traditional narrative account but is composed primarily of edited transcripts of recorded face-to-face and phone conversations and emails exchanged between Garner, Hooper and Krasnostein.They worked from a staggering amount of raw material: their final 50,000-word book was a heavily edited version of 265,000 words of recorded conversations. The authors came to an agreement about the transcripts early on.View image in fullscreenCourtroom sketch artist Anita Lester’s illustration of Erin Patterson during the trial.Photograph: Charlie Kinross/The Guardian“There was a rule that was stringently enforced, about not putting too much lipstick on things that were said spontaneously,” Krasnostein says.Too much polishing, adds Hooper, would have compromised the authenticity and the natural flow of the women’s discussions.The project began as a road trip, a literary iteration of a feminist road movie that inevitably led to bouts of humour – observational, ironic, absurdist but invariably dark in hue – along the way. Their thoughts and reflections, recorded immediately after leaving the courtroom or media overflow room, and on the two-and-a-half hour road trips from Melbourne to Morwell, captured a raw, unfiltered response to the evidence.Garner, the most famous of the three for covering trials, admits she was not at first “burning” to cover this one. And yet, at some point, a phrase from Janet Malcolm’s The Journalist and the Murderer crept into her head.“‘The familiar stirrings of reportorial desire’, I think is the phrase,” she says. “Just that thought, a little itch you get when you think ‘maybe I am interested in this after all’.”View image in fullscreenThe exterior of the home where Erin Patterson served death cap mushroom-laced beef wellingtons in July 2023 in Leongatha, Victoria.Photograph: James Ross/AAPThe idea of doing it with two younger women with whom she shared a friendship appealed to her. Relegated to the back seat in the car, Garner’s quirky, observational notes at times border on the delightfully absurd. “Look at that banksia bush,” she insists, in the middle of a tense encounter with an ominous looking black SUV with tinted windows that silently creeps up behind the women while they park outside Patterson’s desolate house. As they hightail it out of Leongatha, she is preoccupied with some nearby cattle on a hill: “What are those black ones called?”Garner insists it was not her intention to subvert the gritty true crime tenor of their mission.“It’s just I was in the nanna position in the car,” she says. “My whole life is just a matter of looking at things that don’t seem to have any meaning until you pick them up and put them somewhere.”With its vividly described world – eternal fog, coal dust, pubs and motels (complete with sprouting mushrooms in the gardens) – Morwell almost becomes a character in the book. It is the backdrop to the authors’ almost nightly sessions in their motel, where they air their nagging concerns over what they are doing.“Is our bearing witness actually more high-minded, or are we dressing up our own motives?” asks Hooper.“I would hate to think I was just perving,” Garner retorts.View image in fullscreenHelen Garner: ‘There’s a lot of pain and fear and sadness and anxiety about whether you should be writing about it in the first place.’Photograph: Eugene Hyland/The GuardianWith the recurring evidence of poisoned food, foraging in the forest, the whole “witchiness” of it all, as Hooper describes it, the strong feminist leanings of all three writers are never far from the surface. The whole “Adam and Eve thing with the apple”, Krasnostein says, “the sorrow it contains … like Medea” – albeit one where the outraged woman slaughters her husband’s parents, not his kids.The trio discuss the ways the media portrays women who kill; the contrast between the “grizzled and broken” male crime journalists and their highly maintained young female counterparts (do they smile so much to prove they are defanged, Hooper muses); and the frustrations of intelligent women who are relegated to home-maker roles. In Erin’s case, where does all that “unused intellectual energy” go? Either “a weird sense of superiority”, Krasnostein suggests, “or researching the hell out of mushrooms”.As the trial stretches well beyond the initially predicted five weeks, the women come to the grim realisation there is the possibility of a hung jury, or even a not-guilty verdict, given almost all of the evidence is circumstantial. In the book, Garner warns her co-writers she is unwilling to endure a retrial; since the book was written, Pattersonis now appealing against her convictions, maintaining she is innocent and that the deaths were a terrible accident.“The idea that this gruelling life that we were living was going to go on and on and on, with no end to it, that’s what my moment of panic was,” Garner says now.“It was kind of unbearable, and there’s a lot of pain and fear and sadness and anxiety about whether you should be writing about it in the first place. And I’m thinking I’m too old, I can’t go back there. I can’t do this again.”And the mind of Erin Patterson, behind a face that looked “out of a myth”, still remained “deep and unknowable” to Garner.‘I’m never surprised when I read about a woman murdering a man’: Helen Garner on her Baillie Gifford prize-winning diariesRead more“There’s something about her that remains mysterious to me, and I think that will always be the case,” she says. “There are other murders I’ve written about where I felt that I was able to understand the person who had committed the crime, that I had some ability, some clue, about why they did it. What powerful pain in their life or frustration in their life might have led them to do this appalling thing.“But I find that very hard with Erin Patterson.

This debut novel by software engineer Sam Hughes writing under the pen name qntm pushes the idea to the most terrifying extreme: the antimeme. Memes are ideas that easily spread; antimemes are literally unthinkable, “self-keeping secrets”, impossible to record or to remember. Some feed on memories and pose an existential threat. But how is it possible to win a war when there’s no identifiable enemy, and every attack is immediately forgotten? Against these odds, the Antimemetics Division somehow exists, part of a secret organisation with bases deep underground in the English countryside, as related in this unforgettable, mind-bendingly brilliant novel.View image in fullscreenThe Merge by Grace Walker(Magpie, £12.99)In a near-future, dystopian Britain, population pressures on scarce resources have resulted in a new technology that promises to cut the problem in half. Any two people who agree to “merge” by having the consciousness of one transported into the other’s body will be rewarded with lower taxes and a better standard of living. The promise is that the two minds will gradually meld into one new person, preserving the best of both. When Laurie is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s, her daughter Amelia signs them up to join a trial group, hoping the merge will preserve Laurie’s mind. They have three months to learn how the process will work, and if they are still doubtful they can call it off – but it seems no one ever does. Moving between the viewpoints of the two women, this is a compelling and disturbing story of love and sacrifice, control and resistance.View image in fullscreenLightbreakersby Aja Gabel(Fleet, £16.99)Early in his career, Noah wrote a paper proposing that human consciousness was the result of quantum physics. Years later he’s invited to take part in a billionaire’s secret project, exploring the nature of consciousness, memory and time. It is not his theory so much as Noah’s experience of losing his only child, Serena, who died in infancy, that makes him a suitable subject to test an experimental time machine. For Noah, the chance of seeing Serena again leads to an obsession that threatens his health and his second marriage. His wife, Maya, responds by going back to visit her parents in Japan, where she also meets her former lover and remembers being young struggling artists together. A rich, compassionate study of love, regret and memory.View image in fullscreenBlack Flameby Gretchen Felker-Martin (Titan, £11.99)In 1980s New York, Ellen, a deeply depressed and repressed lesbian employed by a film archive, is assigned to restore the damaged prints of a legendary pornographic film from Germany, long believed to have been destroyed by the Nazis. Very soon, she starts glimpsing figures from the film in her own life, and it becomes harder to differentiate between her nightmares, fantasies and reality. Explicitly violent and sexual, it’s a queasily compelling horror.The Strength of the Fewby James Islington (Text, £20)The second book in the Hierarchy series, following The Will of the Many, continues the story of Vis Telimus. His world, modelled on Imperial Rome, is run on a sort of spiritual pyramid scheme, where each social class cedes a portion of their life force to the class above, with the result that the ruling Princeps possess godlike powers, while at the base, the Octavii have very diminished lives. Vis has become “synchronous” – split into three identical selves. While one life continues in the Republic, another Vis finds himself in Obiteum (which has an Ancient Egyptian vibe), and there’s a third in a Celtic-flavoured world of druids and warring tribes. Unusually for this type of high-action epic fantasy, there’s first-person narration by the hero, which works extremely well to ensure close reader engagement. Full of excitement, danger and mystery, this thrilling adventure leaves us gasping in anticipation of the next instalment.Explore more on these topicsBooksScience fiction roundupHorror booksFantasy booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

To which Ella Risbridger, who is in her early 30s, sniffle-free and a devotee of Ibbotson’s “sexy and sweet” novels, has this cracking comeback: “If love is the most important thing, and to me it was and is, I want books that think that too.”From here Risbridger plunges into what she charmingly calls “a field guide to delight”. Jane Eyre rubs shoulders with Ice Planet Barbarians (the bright blue aliens who inhabit the ice planet turn out to be sexy in a Mr Rochester kind of way). Pride and Prejudice makes its inevitable appearance, flanked by its many modern iterations, including the ones with dragons. Mills & Boon novels of every stripe are accorded the kind of sustained attention more usually given to Proust, whileJudith Butler’s theories of gender are buttressed by a deft analysis of Rupert Campbell-Black, caddish hero of the Rutshire chronicles by the late, great Jilly Cooper.One of Risbridger’s favourites isThe Piscesby Melissa Broder, in which the heroine falls in love, and lust, with a merman. Risbridger recalls discussing it excitedly with her friends, not least the bit where the heroine has to push her fish/boyfriend hybrid around on a trolley. This last plot point is an obvious stumbling block for anyone looking to romantic fiction for real-life inspiration, and there are plenty of them: in the year that Fifty Shades of Grey took off there was atwo-thirdsincrease in admissions to US emergency units for kink-related accidents.A even more unlikely pairing occurs in Unhinged, by Vera Valentine, in which Tana, the human heroine, starts getting it on with her front door. (Sample dialogue: “I am your door, and I love you”). On taking flesh-and-blood form, however, the door reveals itself to be the son of Zeus, which neatly backs up one of Risbridger’s main points: that the templates of romance narrative are as old as the gods. Knowledge of the classical world is clearly desirable when confronted with a lover who insists on showing up disguised as a white bull, the North Wind or, indeed, a household fixture.The fluidity of the romance genre has allowed endless retellings of canonical novels, with each becoming edgier than the lastIt is this shape-shifting quality that Risbridger celebrates as one of the genre’s great pleasures, arguing that there is “something inherently bisexual – or more properly, pansexual in the fluidity of romantic fiction”. Sometimes the author bakes same-sex attraction into her text: Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca positively thrums with the eroticised spark between the first and second Mrs De Winter, mediated by the permanently a-simmer housekeeper Mrs Danvers. More subtle, although more powerful, are those works where the queer attraction is coded or unconscious, lying in wait to be made use of by an attentive reader.To demonstrate what she means, Risbridger offers an analysis of one of her favourite tropes of romantic fiction: the love rival. The love rival is the pitch-perfect woman who appears, at least in the early chapters, to offer the hero everything that his alpha-male heart could desire. She is pretty, rich, clever, all without seeming to try too hard. This is in direct contrast to the heroine, who is full of unrequited longing, self-doubt and a touch of body dysmorphia. Celebrated love rivals include Caroline Bingley in Pride and Prejudice or Blanche Ingram in Jane Eyre and, for pages at a time, she is all that the heroine can think about.This may seem like small beer as far as same-sex passion goes, but bear in mind that Mills & Boon did not publish an explicitly queer title until 2020. Instead, the fluidity of the romance genre has allowed endless retellings of canonical novels, each becoming edgier than the last. Fifty Shades of Grey began as fan fiction based on the Twilight series, which in turn was a retelling of Bram Stoker’s Dracula by way of Anne Rice’s lusciously camp vampire books. In the course of this lengthy metamorphosis, desire gets diverted, queered, kinked and set free to roam where it will. And it is this quality of loving lawlessness, suggests Risbridger, that gives romantic fiction its deep joy and special pleasure.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s something that is hard to pull off, melting the fourth wall and fusing those two experiences. Not just giving people permission to dance, unselfconsciously, but to tap into what the performers are expressing – in this case, the hopeful freedom and defiant joy of reggae culture.There are five main dancers but these Sadler’s Wells East shows also have a supporting cast of students and elders. It’s a splendidly diverse setup, making the point that everyone is invited. They get us on our feet (there are seats for people who need them), but also arguably form a kind of curtain between audience and the main performers. Still, they’ve got a good vibe.Bibi Rukiya’s Restless Daughter review – Lorca’s matriarch sparks tragic dance of desireRead moreChoreographerAkeim Toussaint Buckhas not only created the dance, but also written and sung the dub, reggae and jazz-tinged soundtrack for the show with his band, the Magnificence. The bass comes through the speakers, volume pushed up to distortion, like a fuzzy-edged bullet you take to the chest. It’s a slow heartbeat of rhythm, the two and the four, that carries the show. You feel it like a call and response in your own dancing, step on one, catch the beat in your body on two. The dancers expand on this, the reverb bouncing through them. They sync up in laid-back routines, get lost in their own worlds, the moves easy and earthy, souls feeding on sounds.The mood is warmth, community, smiles, a little samey. Then one dancer clutches his hands to his face and chest, pushing out his voice to call for freedom for the world and for Palestine (there have been protests over Sadler’s Wells accepting sponsorship from Barclays, which provides financial services to defence companies supplying Israel, so it’s a live topic here). The other dancers surround him and he is absorbed back into the dance. It’s an interesting bit of grit, but the party soon resumes. Free is an enjoyable gathering, but there’s a stronger piece of theatre in there potentially.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 8 November then atBradford Arts Centreon 21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDanceReggaeSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Someone should have seen the clues, for her photography is not so much tragic as utterly alienated from the human species. Here is a woman nursing her baby, a modern Madonna – except the woman’s limbs are as thin as an addict’s, her face wizened and the infant resting in her arms, dressed in baby clothes, is a monkey. Just to make clear that this is an absurd, miserable travesty of Madonnas and motherhood Arbus captioned it: “A woman with her baby monkey, NJ, 1971.” It is an utterly pitiable image of desperation, of someone trying to make sense of a life that can’t be made sense of. And the despair mirrors that of Arbus herself.You might want to see her many images of gender-blurring positively. There’s a photograph called Transvestite at Her Birthday Party, NYC 1969: she lies on her bed laughing, double chinned and gap-toothed in a blond wig, in a shabby hotel room with balloons. But Arbus actually said how macabre and pathetic she found the occasion: “She called me up and said it was her birthday party and would I come and I said, ‘How terrific.’ It was a hotel on Broadway and 100th Street … I’ve been in some pretty awful places but the lobby was really like hades.” The elevator was broken so Arbus walked up to the fourth floor. “You had to step over about three or four people every flight. And then I came into her room. The birthday party was me and her, a whore friend of hers and her pimp, and the cake.”View image in fullscreenTransvestite With Her Birthday Cake, NYC, 1969.Photograph: © The Estate of Diane ArbusIt wasn’t that Arbus did not like or admire her friend. But she saw how impoverished and lonely her life was and ruthlessly photographed that sad truth as she saw it, not her little moments of victory. Arbus portrayed her as a freak because she saw everyone that interested her as a freak (a word she used). There’s even a portrait of a baby here that manages to be pessimistic and hopeless, seeing a fleshy mess of potential flaws in that unformed face – a born freak.When Arbus was catapulted to artistic stardom by a posthumous exhibition at New York’s Museum of ModernArtin 1972, the cultural critic Susan Sontag took exception. She wrote a brilliant essay condemning Arbus for dwelling on misery and ugliness, rejecting her work as anti-humanist. Sontag was right about the morality of these photographs. But I don’t agree that art has to be humane. It just has to have a strong, memorable vision. If Arbus is a bad artist so are Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol, Lucian Freud and Velázquez, all of whom share her disenchanted eye. To be a horrible, mean, depressive person and communicate that in your art is not failure – if the art is as haunting and unforgettable as that of Arbus.The scary reason she is so good is because her eye is true. As it happens, I have met two of the people in this show and see their real faces in memory from her shots. Norman Mailer I spoke to in an awful first term at university when I blundered into an after-event gathering: I can’t remember what we talked about but I remember how kind he was. He twinkles for Arbus, too. As for Gerard Malanga, whom I met much later, she captures the sultry splendour of the Velvet Underground’s whip dancer in his youthful glory. I believe these pictures.View image in fullscreenFemale impersonator on bed, NYC, 1961.Photograph: © The Estate of Diane ArbusArbus can see beauty. She finds no flaw in Marcello Mastroianni resting on his bed in a hotel room. Nor does her near-naked Mia Farrow look anything but immaculate. But these are not her best work – they are celebrity pics that a thousand snappers could take. It’s when Arbus photographs the rest of us, the ones the camera does not love, that she can do what very few photographers achieve and reveal a personal vision of life, albeit a grotesquely bleak one.Behold the little man in the arms of his tall dominatrix, embracing perhaps the only person who brings happiness into his life, when she cracks the whip and cures his heart. Feast your eyes on the nudist family, with a teenaged daughter obliged to share her parent’s lifestyle. And there’s age, of course. The cruellest photographs here are of wealthy old widows, evidently sought out by Arbus as keenly as the nudists. She homes in on dry mummified skin under the jewellery. Mrs T Charlton Henry, portrayed in 1965, looks literally dead as she sits in a dress with a skeletal wrist and hand on her armchair. I dare you to find a positive in that.Arbus did have a sensual eye for beauty, but it is ugliness she finds all around her, and it scratches at her soul. She sees every blemish, every bad haircut and decaying face. She sees the monkey’s little hand touching its “mother” in a final gut-wrenching detail of twisted love. What a monster, what a genius.Diane Arbus: Sanctum Sanctorum is atDavid Zwirner, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsDiane ArbusExhibitionsArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

But South Korean choreographer Sung Im Her’s sparky sequences forParadise Now!at the Bush theatre in 2022 were not just strikingly inventive but also perfectly attuned to playwright Margaret Perry’s satire.Alongside movement direction for theatre, her dance productions have consideredthe sway of social mediaand#MeToo in her home country. She now confronts another headline issue, the climate crisis, in the Southbank Centre’sKunstyperformance series.In a solo prologue, she steals on to a barren stage in silence, gradually unfolding her body. From a compact state she limbers into a canter around the perimeter, starkly lit by an imprisoning grid of bulbs. This individual transformation prefigures a collective one as the choreographer exits, replaced by six dancers initially buckling under the world’s weight. They veer from inertia to thwarted intentions, huddling vulnerably under a spotlight as if cast adrift. While they’re dressed in shirts and slacks, the parallel is those images of polar bears on shrinking icebergs.View image in fullscreenIndividual transformation … Sung Im Her in 1 Degree Celsius‘The body is everything’: Sung Im Her’s insatiable desire for danceRead moreMio Jue’s costumes incorporate scraps of silver, giving this ragtag band the air of survivors amid dystopian wreckage. Gradually they assemble to confront an issue that has overwhelmed them. It’s a compelling call to replace climate anxiety with collaborative action. Husk Husk and Lucy Duncan’s score accordingly moves from woozy and spectral, with glimmers of hope, into a thumping pulse as the intensity builds and the ensemble stride with straight backs, endure body blows and mobilise to a dancer’s occasional cry. Crucially, the performers are shown to not just be keeping up with but learning from each other.As their arms are raised and thrown down in release, there’s a sense not just of shedding fear but holding on to joy and that switch is similarly conveyed through Young Uk Lee’s lighting. We need to roll up our sleeves, the piece suggests, but let down our hair too.There is a gnomic coda and an overall coolness that can feel restrictive. But what it lacks in sweep and emotion it mostly makes up for in the urgency for a collective reset as those bodies, this body of people, prove more resilient than they first seemed.AtCrescent theatre, Birmingham, on 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceTheatreSouthbank CentreClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

From Caravaggio’s intense scenes to Rembrandt’s profound portraits, artists had been experimenting with darkness for centuries. This painting shows how deeply Dutch 17th-century artists were drawn to the dark. It dwells in the darkest part of the church, brooding among shadows. At the sides, we can see the church’s public spaces are brightly lit, presumably with many candles. But in the dark, less visited part, fears and phantoms might dwell. In a greathorror story by Sheridan Le Fanu, the similarly dark paintings of Gottfried Schalken turn out to contain a terrifying secret. Perhaps this painting holds a horror story of its own, for a tomb in it bears the name of Hendrick van Steenwyck the Younger – but the canvas is signed by him too. Did he paint it posthumously?

And while he outlines the group’s origins and early development, this takes a back seat to his “youth escapades” in San Francisco, “before the internet, before that city got ruined”. Much of the focus is on his sexual awakening, and how the related secrecy and shame have affected his life. “I was having sex with men when I was very young, 13 or 14,” he says. “It was such a taboo, and that set the tone of my life.” In the memoir, episodes involving his cruising public toilets and parks as a teenager are recounted unflinchingly and unapologetically. “I had sex with older men in bushes,” he writes. “Shamefully at first, proudly later. Fuck off.”“When I do readings, I start with that section,” he says. “I understand how provocative statements like that are; it’s so inappropriate. But I’m not ashamed. With Trump in power, my truth needs to be shouted loud, to combat the racism, the anti-trans and homophobic mindsets.” He pauses. “Iwantto be provocative. I have relatives who are Christian people, and it’s absolutely my intention to ruin their Thanksgiving dinner with this book. Because they’ll all read it.”View image in fullscreen‘Rock bands didn’t have keyboards then’ … Roddy Bottum, right, with Faith No More in 1990.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesThe memoir opens on the teenage Bottum relocating from his native Los Angeles. “San Francisco was an abrupt about-face from the sunny superficiality of LA,” he says. “Cold. Dark. People with dyed black hair and white faces, people doing crystal meth and heroin. The queer culture that existed in San Francisco was all so different from Los Angeles. It was inspiring.”It’s here, in 1981, that Bottum joined Faith No Man (later Faith No More) with Billy Gould and Mike Bordin, accenting their “pummelling rhythm section” with “a sense of beauty atop that darkness. Rock bands didn’t have keyboards then.” They cycle through vocalists, including – briefly –Courtney Love, the memoir’s most vivid character, an unabashed chaos agent setting apartments ablaze and making enemies at every turn.“Courtney and I both knew right away that we were soulmates, that we would always be friends,” Bottum says. Their platonic friendship briefly blurred into a sexual relationship, resulting in pregnancy and abortion; later, Bottum became a trusted confidant of Love and her husband,Kurt Cobain. Far from the grunge Lady Macbeth of misogynist legend, Bottum portrays Love as someone with wit, energy and agency.“Courtney had a hard go of it,” he nods. “A controversial woman who’s very powerful, and so smart. And that’s a very attractive, exciting person to write about. She’s a warm, compassionate person, and a lot of people aren’t exposed to that. But we were very close and took care of each other.”The embryonic Faith No More were, Bottum admits, “absolutely preposterous”. Their music centred around repetitive heavy grooves jammed out while under the influence of various drugs, including MDMA, while their frontman, alcoholic oddball Chuck Mosley, “didn’t have a good singing voice”. But they had ambition. “Everyone in our scene was into goth and dark stuff, but we loved MTV, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper. In some crazy way, we imagined we were part of that mix. Though there was nothing shiny or attractive or poptastic about us.”But their sardonic rock-rap anthem We Care a Lot became a minor MTV hit in 1988, Mosley ceded the mic to the photogenic Mike Patton (whodidhave a good singing voice), and by 1990 Faith No More’s third album was a bona fide, Grammy-nominated hit. Characteristically, The Royal We doesn’t dwell on this triumph, jump-cutting instead to their disastrous stint on Guns N’ Roses and Metallica’s 1992 stadium tour.The heroin was me self-medicating, so I could feel OK about living all these secretsIt was, Bottum says, “the biggest tour that had ever happened”. But Faith No More were quickly alienated by the “toxic” rock’n’roll circus they’d clambered aboard; in the memoir, he recounts an unsettling encounter with groupies recruited for GN’R’s entertainment. “The misogyny and the bravado of the macho dynamic coming from the Guns N’ Roses camp was suffocating,” he says. “They had that song One In a Million, with the N word and the F word [faggot], and that was the vibe backstage. I didn’t want any part of it. We didn’t want to loan our credibility, our culture, our individuality to this poison.”The tour – from which Faith No More were sacked two weeks early, for badmouthing GN’R in the press – marked a turning point for Bottum. “I needed to be who I was,” he says, “to talk about being gay, to distance myself from this toxic environment.” Against his managers’ advice, he came out in the pages of the Advocate the following year. “I was the only out queer guy in rock,” he says. “Freddie Mercuryhadn’t come out before he died.Michael Stipedidn’t talk about it, norRob Halford, norBob Mould. It made me angry. I needed to put myself on that page of history, to get people to accept a queer person in music. And I met so many kids who were queer, who felt my being a queer person in music made a difference to them.”Bottum hadn’t even discussed his sexuality with his bandmates, even though he travelled with his boyfriend on the tourbus. “They were open minded, they would have been OK with it,” he says. “It was the damage of being a gay kid in that era, the damage of the shame and homophobia.” He found instant acceptance from Cobain, the Nirvana frontman who was the proud antithesis of the misogyny and homophobia that had blighted the GN’R tour. “Kurt was like a unicorn,” Bottum says softly. “He wanted to be gay – Kurt loved the provocation of that. I think that’s why we were really good friends. He loved that I was gay, that that was a thing he got to be around. He was a very special person.”View image in fullscreen‘I needed to be who I was’ … Roddy Bottum performing at Coachella in 2010.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyBottum grew close to Cobain and Love, the trio bonded at the time by heroin addiction. Bottum had been struggling to keep his habit under wraps from his bandmates for some time. “It was a drug of secrets, something you did behind closed doors,” he says. “The darkness of heroin had been an attraction to me – putting a needle in your arm is pretty extreme. I didn’t realise its impact on my life, the wreckage it caused to my friends and family.”In 1993, Bottum overdosed in New York. “I died for a moment, and then came back to life,” he remembers. In early 1994, as his father was dying of cancer, he, Love and Cobain made plans to go to rehab together in Long Beach; ultimately, only Bottum made the trip. After several gruelling months, he returned to their house, Love hoping that his newly sober presence might prove a positive influence on Cobain. Bottum stayed in Seattle for a few days, then flew home. A week later, Cobain took his own life.“The first time death happens in a young person’s life is so devastating,” he remembers. “But this was so violent. There had been a gun involved. I couldn’t stop thinking about how that meant the bullet went through his head, and his skull was shattered.”Bottum fell into a deep depression, but his sobriety did not waver. “I felt like, I made it through this. This – Kurt’s death – is what happens. My sobriety was why I was still here, and he was not.” He started a new band, Imperial Teen. “We were queer people, singing about man-to-man relationships,” he says. “And it was only when writing the book I realised: this was my happy ending. The darkness I’d had to pass through was the shame I’d felt. The heroin was me self-medicating, so I could feel OK about living all these secrets. And when I was able to unveil those secrets, everything changed. Imperial Teen was me being honest and open, celebrating my life – a recognition of my acceptance of myself.

Does he see any parallel between these tragic creatures with hidden darknesses and himself?

I’m up to 900 exhibitions now. Forty countries around the world and the artworks are in about 80 museums. So you suddenly start thinking about legacy projects and the fact that I can’t keep these levels of energy up.“I suppose there’s something quite nice about projecting yourself into a future, which is quite exciting.”The living sculpture will form part of Lower Chew Forest, which at 422 acres and 100,000 trees, will be one of the biggest new woodlands inEnglandwhen completed.Pathways and avenues, blossoming at different times of year, will be created to guide visitors to Echo Wood on a journey through the forest towards a central circular gathering space, formed from 12 English oak trees.As with many of his projects, Jerram wants this central space to foster creativity. “It will form an event space. It can be used for weddings or educational activities, music, poetry, you name it,” he says.Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is alink to the videoinstead.Artwork Echo Wood through the seasons – videoJerram’s other works, which often touch on themes of nature and the climate emergency, include: Gaia, a seven-metre diameter sculpture of the Earth using Nasa imagery; Helios, a sculpture of the Sun using detailed solar imagery to recreate its surface; and Tipping Point, a simulated forest fire combining smoke, lights and sound.Echo Wood is perhaps the closest representation of those themes, a symbol of the fight against climate change. “This is a way to physically do something about it. Using creativity to inspire the general public, but also to help use trees to raise a bit of money and create a legacy,” Jerram says. “What art can do is communicate messages in a different language that can then reach people in a slightly different way.“I’m often collaborating with scientists, but also charities on how to communicate their ideas.”Despite theconcerning lack of progress in tackling the climate crisis, Jerram says he is “always hopeful” despite finding “the breaching of tipping points” frightening.View image in fullscreenJerram is known for his seven-metre sculpture of the Earth, seen here at the Painted Hall in the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, which uses images from Nasa.Photograph: Vickie Flores/EPA“There’s this lovely comic illustration of a doctor with a slightly ill looking Earth in front of them on the doctor’s chair,” Jerram says. “The Earth is saying: ‘I’m afraid we’ve got a nasty infection of humans at the moment.’ The doctor says: ‘Don’t worry, it’ll soon pass.’“We’re just the latest invasive species.”The wood from his latest artwork will ultimately be sustainably harvested and used for educational and creative projects, before the trees are replanted to then continue the cycle of life.“I like the idea of what can you then do with the wood – turn the oak into playground equipment for the schools in the city, or create a boat, or musical instruments for kids in the city,” Jerram says.View image in fullscreenLuke Jerram with his installation Helios at Fountains Abbey in Ripon, North Yorkshire.Photograph: Danny Lawson/PACompanies and individuals are able to sponsor individual trees to raise money for Avon Needs Trees, which has a number of tree-planting projects across the region.“Stood in the heart of a brand new forest, Echo Wood is a symbol of optimism to us and future generations that with some thought, creativity and determination we can meet the climate and nature crises we’re facing,” Dave Wood, the chief executive of Avon Needs Trees, says. “Not quite a message in a bottle but a message in wood, water and sunlight.“We want as many people as possible to be thinking about creative ways to meet the climate and nature crises we’re facing. By working with Luke, we’re able to engage a whole new set of people who otherwise might not make the journey out into the countryside to see the work we’re doing to increase woodland cover in a severely deforested part of the country.”Explore more on these topicsArtTrees and forestsSculptureSomersetEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In Ukraine, a Jewish comedian named Volodymyr Zelenskyy had made the improbable leap from sitcom about accidentally becoming president to actually becoming president. Perhaps, if she were to take her political career seriously, she should start writing jokes.‘No one’s been willing to take a risk’: are Palestinian films still struggling to get seen?Read moreIt worked. As an Israeli Jew fluent in Hebrew, Arabic and English, Shuster Eliassi could nimbly weave between different audiences, and what started as short comedic videos on social media soon became an invitation from Harvard to develop a full-on stand-up routine skewering the idea of coexistence as it’s often used in the Israeli-Palestinian context. The show would riff on her upbringing in one of the only joint Israeli-Palestinian communities in the country, threading a fine needle with self-deprecating humor and an activist’s edge. The aim, she told the Guardian, was to “unpack” the idea of coexistence, “and say, like, ‘this is how I grew up, there are so many funny kumbayah moments,andI propose something else.’”That was in 2019. By the time Shuster Eliassi took the stage in Montreal in September of last year, to perform the full routine before a documentary crew, the idea of coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians seemed even more vastly and horrifically remote. After an affable routine ranging from her asking Palestinian neighbors for kebabs on Israeli independence day (“no agenda, just tahini!”) to her Jewish mother meddling in her dating life, Shuster Eliassi addressed the elephant in the room. It used to be the occupation, she says. “Now, the elephant in the room is genocide.”That moral clarity – the insistence on calling out that elephant in the room, through disarming humor and radical frankness – forms the backbone of Coexistence, My Ass!, a magnetic new documentary, directed by Amber Fares, that takes its name from Shuster Eliassi’s trilingual one-woman show. The film, shot over five seismic years in the US and Israel, chronicles both the development of Shuster Eliassi’s singular comedy, rooted in a too-rare portrait of Arab-Israeli friendship, and the stunning collapse of any near-term hope for real coexistence in the wake of the 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks and Israel’s retaliatory destruction of Gaza, killing over 71,000 Palestinians. “I thought the film was going to be about [Noam] trying to be a comedian in the US, and probably going to university campuses in the year of an election,” said Fares. “And the film just took an entirely different turn.”First it was Covid, which forced Shuster Eliassi to leave Harvard for Israel, where she was quarantined with a mixed group of Arabs and Israelis that recalled her unusual upbringing in Neve Shalom / Wahat as-Salam (“Oasis of Peace”). The daughter of an Iranian-Jewish mother and a Romanian Ashkenazi Jewish father – “woke, progressive leftists” who “believed Israelis and Palestinians deserve the same equal human rights”, she says with faux disbelief in her routine – Shuster Eliassi grew up as a literal “poster child for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process”. She socialized with Palestinian neighbors, learned Arabic from Palestinian educators and represented the idea of peace to numerous celebrities who visited the village; the film includes a clip of Shuster Eliassi and her Palestinian best friend Ranin getting a shout out from Jane Fonda.“My parents saw moving here as a way to say ‘we’re not just joining a seminar or a dialogue group, we want to live in this alternative way.’ As a political statement, not just a kumbayah thing,” Shuster Eliassi said. “There was always a sense of doing – not just talking about the alternative, but with your individual choices, doing it.”The show’s mocking premise – Coexistence, My Ass! (“let’s start with my ass,” she jokes, lest you have your guard up) – drew from frustration with the sloganeering of peace: the celebrity visits, the lip service, the lack of real reckoning with how true coexistence cannot coexist with occupation. “It has been so frustrating to always see this notion of coexistence used repeatedly as a nice decoration,” she said. “It’s like how Trump can come here and say that he is making peace – these are words. Nobody is ‘against’ coexistence.”“But to me, it was so clear that we will only be able to taste [coexistence] after we talk about the root of the problem and we act on it, especially as Israeli Jews that have privilege and the responsibility to do this.”The film follows Shuster Eliassi as she attempts to keep her increasing media presence – post-Covid, she secures a regular gig on a TV show; a music video mocking Arab countries selling out Palestine, called “Dubai Dubai”, goes viral – in line with her principles, particularly as the Israeli comedy scene turns away from discussion of the occupation. Some attempts to thread the needle fall flat; others soar (“Don’t worry, I’m only going to be here for seven minutes, not 70 years,” she tells a Palestinian audience to uproarious laughs). “Some comedians in Israel are like, ‘oh here’s Noam, she’s the one who talks about the occupation – why can’t you do, like, Tinder jokes and stuff?’” she said. At a pro-democracy protest against corruption in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, Shuster Eliassi repeatedly asks liberal Israelis whether they see the protests as at all connected to Palestine. Most say no.“Because Israelis were never confronted with decades of illegal occupation and actually controlling Palestinian people – Israelis were never confronted with what it’s actually doing to the moral fabric of our society, and what it means that our society is so hyper-militarized,” said Shuster Eliassi of that common response. “Everyone takes a role in the escalation of the dehumanization of Palestinians.”As she tells it, on 6 October 2023, Shuster Eliassi finally achieved her mother’s dream of bringing home a new boyfriend. The next day, nothing was ever the same. The documentary shies away from showing footage of the slaughter on 7 October, or the mass killings in Gaza – a “very conscious decision”, said Fares. “We felt that by the time this film came out, that footage would been seen and seen and overseen.” Instead, it cuts to Shuster Eliassi at the funeral of longtime peace activist Vivian Silver, who waskilledin the attacks, then her despair at the carnage in Gaza, the escalation of her protests and the feverish pitch of social media commentary across languages.View image in fullscreenNoam Shuster Eliassi in Coexistence, My Ass!Photograph: Philippe BellaicheIn the intervening two years, Shuster Eliassi has performed less in her home country, owing in part to lack of audience, in part to dwindling venues willing to book her, and in part because she’s now expecting her first child. “A lot of comedians who’ve continued doing comedy during this time – I don’t want to demonize all of them, but I’ve had a huge heartbreak,” she said. “It’s like American comedians who contributed to the re-election of Trump. You’re like, ‘Oh my god, this is how you’re using this tool that was designed to fight against fascism?’ It’s the same thing, when I see comedians making fun of starving Gazans on stage or using comedy to do Israeli propaganda.”She has fared better outside the country, where Coexistence, My Ass! has mirrored her routine’s ability to invite in and challenge diverse audiences without alienating them. Anindependent releasewithout major backers, the film premiered at Sundance and opened the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, in a co-presentation with the Arab Film & Media Institute, offering a different but still sharp angle on the conflict. Still, Shuster Eliassi notes, “a lot of what we’re saying in this film, Palestinians have been saying for a really long time. And I say to the audiences, that if they feel relieved or reassured because they hear it from an Israeli Jew – why don’t you believe Palestinians? Why do you need an Israeli Jewish character to [believe]?”Shuster Eliassi and I spoke days after a ceasefire was announced, which still hasnot stoppedthe killing in Gaza. The film, like her routine, like so many invested in true coexistence, are left bereft – imagine, she says on stage, if we had addressed the elephant in the room in time?“I often think about how I just got lucky, to have this opportunity to exist with Palestinians and have Palestinian neighbors and friends and educators, to have Palestinian life and existence become part of my DNA,” she told me. “It’s extraordinary to me how ordinary it could be. And it really makes me sad, to think how easily things could have been much, much different.”Hope, she noted, is a strange thing to consider in the midst of atrocities, but it persists. “I don’t know what it is about the human spirit, like how Palestinians are surviving this, how my grandmother moved on after a Nazi camp. How people are constantly rebuilding homes, how I’m now carrying a child into this impossible reality,” she said. “There is something irrational about hope. And it’s very similar to coexistence – these are what our human tendencies can lead to, if we are dedicated to humanity.”Coexistence, My Ass! is now showing in select US cinemas with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsIsrael-Gaza warComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But how do you make sure you’re buying something that’s built for longevity and won’t fall apart after just a few wears?The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As a menswear writer and stylist with years of experience, I’m clued up on the brands that know what they’re doing when it comes to knitwear (from high-street hitters and independents to family-run Scottish mills and luxury labels) – and I’m well versed in how to make it look good, too.Here’s my guide to the best brands available right now, and how to choose the best piece for you, as well as a few insider styling hacks and tips on how to keep your chosen piece in your rotation for as long as possible.Thebest men’s knitwear brandsResponsible knitwearAsketView image in fullscreenAsket knitwearBest for:transparencyAsket is all about transparency. In fact, you can see an “impact receipt” with a detailed cost and environmental breakdown for every design;Asket also either repairs or recyclesany pieces that are damaged. And that’s before you get to the certified responsible textiles and the fact that the brand designs with longevity in mind, with classic silhouettes that don’t date, to encourage a “buy less, buy better” approach.There’s loads of knitwear on offer. My personal favourite is the merino woolpolo(£120), but there’s also ajumper(£110) orroll neck(£120) using the same fabric. If you want to treat yourself, though, thecashmere(£190) is a softer choice, or there’s acotton sweater(£100), all of which come in a selection of neutrals and jewel tones.Rise & FallView image in fullscreenRise & Fall knitwearBest for:luxurious pieces without the mark upRise & Fall has a few core values: limit waste by matching supply and demand; use responsible fabrics; and offer everything at a reasonable price. Its manufacturers are some of the best in the game, so ethical working practices and environmental responsibility are a given. Each product has a transparent breakdown of its materials, too.Responsibility aside, the London-based label’s knitwear is some of the softest, comfiest, chicest around. Every time I wear my Rise & Fall, it’s a compliment magnet. My favourite is thecashmere sweatshirtwith a loose hem (£225), but you can get everything from azip hoodie(£240) to aquarter zip(£190) to a classicmerino cardigan(£135), as well asgloves(£55), asnood(£95) and acashmere cap(£90) – all of which would make great Christmas presents.Sheep IncView image in fullscreenSheep Inc knitwearBest for:carbon-negative knitwearThere are barely any knitwear brands thatremovecarbon dioxide from the atmosphere – but Sheep Inc does – and it’s B Corpcertified.Its wool is from regenerative farms (such as those that use rotational grazing). The energy used in the manufacturing process is renewable, and the brand invests in biodiversity initiatives such as the Meru and Nanyuki community regeneration project based in the foothills of Mount Kenya and a reforestation project in the Acre Amazonian rainforest in Brazil, and uses 3D knitting machines to guarantee zero-waste. Use your phone to scan signature NFC tags on each garment, and you can trace the product’s entire journey, all the way down to the sheep that produced the wool.And it’s not just good from an environmental perspective – the knitwear is some of the best on the market. The best pieces are those with the brand’s signature playful twist, such as thecontrast hem jumpers, which come in at £250. Then, I love the more casual knits, such as thezip-through sweaters(£270) andpullover hoodies(£250), which come in some bold, punchy colours, as well as the classics, such as theoriginal crew neck(£220).High street knitwearUniqloView image in fullscreenUniqlo knitwearBest for:affordable cashmereUniqlo has a great selection of reasonably priced knitwear. The best value for money is thelightweightmerino wool sweatshirtfor £34.90, and achunkier lamb’s woolfor £29.90. But the jumper Ialwaysrecommend from Uniqlo is thecashmere crew neck. It’s not often you find a pure cashmere jumper for under £100, let alone £89.90. It comes in a great selection of colours, but a word of warning: the good shades tend to sell out fairly early in the season, so if there’s any that catch your eye, jump.SimswearView image in fullscreenSimswear knitwearBest for:UK-made knitwearFor founder Billy Sims-Hilditch, the motivation to start Simswear was to make great knitwear that lasts – and as soon as you feel any of the jumpers in person, the quality is obvious from the weight and the softness. Beyond the slow-fashion approach, every garment is made in the UK using natural fibres, including the carding to the spinning, knitting, weaving, cutting and sewing.One of my favourite things about the brand’s collection, though, is the strong range of colour options, such as petrol blue, forest green and poppy red. Thepetrol green merino lamb’s wool jumper(£225) takes my top spot, but some of my other highlights from the current collection are themerino roll neck(£245) and the knittedrugby(£255). And, if you’re happy to wait until early February next year, you can pre-order for a significantlyreduced RRP.KiltaneView image in fullscreenKiltane knitwearBest for:Scottish knitsIf you’re looking for Scottish knitwear, Kiltane’s your best bet. If you’ve ever visited Edinburgh, chances are you’ve passed the flagship store on the Royal Mile, which has been there since 1997.If not, let me bring you up to speed. It’s a luxury knitwear label specialising in cashmere, designed in Edinburgh and crafted in the Scottish Borders at a family-run mill. My standout pieces are those that feel a little more contemporary –thestriped long-sleeve polo(£229) and thetomato-red half zip(£219), for instance. As with all the best knitwear brands, though, Kiltane’s a pro at the classics too, including a simplecrew neck(£209), a cosyroll neck(£239) and a preppy-codedV neck(£139).CosView image in fullscreenCos knitwearBest for:premium knitwear on the high streetCos is a London-based label with a Scandi aesthetic that sits at the high end of the high street. That means it’s a little pricier than most, but the quality and craftsmanship are also at a higher level. Take the men’s knitwear: it’s all designed with a fashion-forward silhouette (relaxed but not baggy) and uses premium textiles such asbrushed wool(£95),merino(£65),cashmere(£169),mohair(£109) andalpaca(£95). Expect elevated design touches such as a dropped shoulder, a chest pocket, a stand collar or a henley neckline.Marks & SpencerView image in fullscreenM&S knitwearBest for:value for moneyM&S is putting a lot of effort into its menswear, from the higher end Autograph and Jaeger lines to its main collection, and even a new menswear-specificInstagram accountwith involvement from fashion influencersOliver ProudlockandSam Salter. I’m loving thewool blend argyle(£38) and thefestive cable knit(£35). If you do want to go premium, though, I’d suggest trying the purecashmere crew neck(£99) or this classiccardi(£135).ArketView image in fullscreenArket knitwearBest for:classic knitwearYou can always count on Arket for a quality jumper. Well, you can actually count on the Scandi label for all of the menswear staples: jeans, T-shirts, Oxford shirts and more. It’s the kind of brand you can wear head to toe and always look polished.For knitwear, this is the place to go for quality classics. The range is full of wearable pieces any guy could pull off – most of which are cut to an ever-so-slightly relaxed fit but still tailored enough to look smart. Since this is the place for the basics, the extra-finemerino wool jumper(£55), which comes in 16 colours, is a top contender, as well as a simplequarter zip(£85), which you could make fashion-y with a shirt and tie à laJonathan Baileyor even dress it down with a T-shirt. Or, you could try my favourite of the lot, the long-sleevemerino polo neck(£65).GapView image in fullscreenGap knitwearBest for:contemporary basicsWhen it comes to quality basics, you can’t go wrong with Gap – and its knitwear is no exception. The CashSoft range is designed to feel like cashmere, with some made with a cotton-nylon-acrylic blend and others pure cotton (the latter’s my recommendation; the former feels a little static). But you can’t beat the merino wool collection – especially the navylong-sleeve polo(£55) and the greycable knit(£60). On the more affordable side of things, though, I’d suggest going for the ever-so-slightly croppedcotton jumper, which comes in at £35 – a great price for a jumper made using a natural textile that’s cut to a nice, contemporary silhouette.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

You can just tellit’s from the Nordics. The colour palette. The contemporary classic silhouette. The premium fabrics and the understated (more or less nonexistent) branding. It’s basically the upmarket version of what Cos and Arket are doing on the high street.And the knitwear follows suit. Thefuzzy, light bluemohair sweater(£230) takes first place for me, while the indigocardigan(£250) comes in a close second, with the whitecable knit(£180) in third. If you prefer the basics, though, a classic crew neck inlamb’s wool(£120) ormerino(£130) is a safe choice.ToastView image in fullscreenToast knitwearBest for:a slow-fashion approachToast makes clothes to last. The brand prioritises natural fibres across its knitwear collection – whether it’s anapple-green marled wool jumper(£165), achunkier design(£205) made using a flecky wool yarn spun in Donegal or a grungystriped alpaca sweater(£245) that wouldn’t look out of place in Kurt Cobain’s wardrobe. Under each product listing online, there’s even a little guide on how to make your knitwear last, with tips on washing, storage and maintenance – simply scroll past the customer reviews to see it.Les DeuxView image in fullscreenLes Deux knitwearBest for:cool-guy knitwearLes Deux is the home of fashion-forward knits. Based in Copenhagen, it all started in 2011 when Andreas von der Heide and Virgil Nicholas were inspired by a T-shirt embellished with military patches – they wanted to create a label to design pieces just like that: understated, unexpected and, dare I say,cool.Knitwear is one of its best categories. My favourite of the bunch is theBrad round-neck knit(£125), which has the brand name subtly embroidered above the hem. There are some bolder options, too, such as thegradient knit(£129) and theglobe crew neck(£149), which is constructed with a patchwork jacquard of logos and graphics.Thames MMXXView image in fullscreenThames MMXX knitwearBest for:underground knitsFor knits you can’t find anywhere else, head to Thames MMXX. The London-based brand was started by Blondey McCoy, a skateboarder and artist, so the collections all have an offbeat counter-culture feel. This is the place you go if you’re after something that feels a bit different. My highlights are the punkyargylepolo neck (£90) and the black crew neck withgrungy graphics(£102) inspired by The Catcher in the Rye.NN07View image in fullscreenNN07 knitwearBest for:statement knitwearNN07 stands for “no nationality”, meaning it’s designed for anyonewho wants to wear it, and the company offers knitwear with personality. The pieces are timeless, but with various standout details. Take thealpaca sweater(£235), for instance, with its unusual light camel ombre finish, or thecardigan(£200) that’s embroided with painterly flowers. Another of my favourites is brand’s twist on a festivefair isle jumper(£260) – instead of being the entire knit, which can sometimes feel a little much, it’s an asymmetric take that is limited to the hemline and the arms. NN07 also has a merino woolcrew-neck cardi(£250), which is a hot ticket on the knitwear scene right now (thanks to the internet’s incumbent boyfriendPaul Mescal, who’s regularly spotted in the silhouette). In short, if you’re after chic knitwear that makes a statement, this is the one for you.GantView image in fullscreenGant knitwearBest for:preppy knitsThe fashion world is still obsessed with all things preppy, and you can lean into the vibe with menswear staples – and Gant is the best place to go.When it comes to knitwear, that meansV necks(£140),embroidered logos(£140) andhalf zips(£150), which the brand styles with collegiate finesse – over aringer T-shirtor ashirt and tie, for instance. Whether you wrap it around your shoulders or simply wear it with straight-leg jeans, you’ll be a preppy king before you know it.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenWhat type of knitwear should I buy?There are three main things to consider: design, fabric and craftsmanship. Since you want it to last, you want classic silhouettes that transcend trends (V neck, crew neck, polo) made using natural fibres (cotton or the countless types of wool, from cashmere to lamb’s wool and merino) by brands that are known for their knitwear.When you’re choosing which to go for, think about how you wear your knits. Do you use it as a layering tool? If yes, a versatile, lightweight jumper would do: a block-colour cashmere or merino wool, for example. Or, if you want your jumper to be the star of the show, go for something that’s a little more designed, be it a cable knit, a stripe or an argyle.What type of knitwear is on trend right now?If you want something that’s on trend, follow the lead of the menswear pros.Pedro Pascalis leading the charge for a slightlycropped silhouette, whilePaul Mescalhas levelled up crew-neck cardigans. Just try to err on the side of classic so that whatever you choose doesn’t date.Should I wear a crew neck or a V neck?Up to you. Both are strong choices – if you prefer to dress understated, a crew neck feels a little easier to wear, while a V neck feels more fashion-y because it’s trending right now (just look at menswear influencers@imdanielsimmons,@christianpttyand@jimy_09). It leans into the hype for preppy menswear, which is growing every year. If you’re looking for styling inspiration, collegiate brands such as Gant or Ralph Lauren are a good starting point.How to style knitwearThere are a few easy styling hacks that can take knitwear from good to great. The easiest of all is wearing a white T-shirt underneath. Having a little white collar on show at the neckline will make your fit look considered – just look atJacob Elordito see how it’s done. If your tee drops down too much, try wearing it back to front – as long as there’s no label at the neck (Gap make some great label-less designs).Then, lean into the versatility: you can wear a knit in pretty much any way you want. Around your neck as a scarf. Diagonally across your body. Or, my personal favourite (and the easiest to get right), draped over your shoulders, whether it’s over a shirt, T-shirt or coat.If you’re still after inspiration, check out@noahaltinkon TikTok, a menswear pro who often posts knitwear styling tips.How to take care of knitwearKnitwear can experience a little wear and tear over time. Actually, some of my worn-in jumpers end up being the ones I reach for most because they’re the comfiest of all – which makes total sense because good knitwear shapes to your body over time. But there’s a fine line between “worn-in” and raggedy, so as soon as you spot holes or bobbles, it’s time for some TLC.To wash or not to wash? How to look after your knitwear: expert tips to stop shrinking, bobbling and mothsRead moreLuckily, it’s easy to take care of. First of all, consider buying yourself a debobbler – an electric fabric shaver that removes pills and fuzz when you pass it over your jumper in circular motions.Steamery’s Pilo 2(£55) is a great option,while theRussell Hobbs lint remover(£19.99) is effective and a little cheaper. Though they’re both designed to work on all fabrics, amanual pilling comb(£8) is a great alternative if you’d like to be gentler on your delicates.When it comes to holes, it’s a bit trickier. If you want to pick up a new hobby à laTom Daley, you could follow theYouTube tutorialsfor a little DIY. Or, for an easier fix, you could find a local seamstress or knitting professional who can help – if you’re London-based, take a look atthe Seam, an online directorywhere you can find clothing maintenance experts in your area.How you wash your knits matters, too. First of all, wash them as little as possible. Get yourself a fabric freshener such asthe Lab Co’s cashmere and wool laundry mist(£9), a gentle formula that eliminates bad odours and leaves a just-washed fragrance. When you dowash them, always hand wash, then roll them in a towel to remove excess water before air-drying flat to prevent stretching or shrinking.For more menswear fashion inspiration from the Filter:50 men’s autumn wardrobe updates for under £150 (some are even free)Ties are cool again – just ask TikTok.

Eight-thirty’Gabriele PaissoniFri 7 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 07.02 ESTShareIn 1965, I was 19 and living in East Berlin. West Berlin was glamorous. They had ­everything: shoes, cars, food. But we had almost nothing. When bananas were imported once or twice a year, the queues stretched further than I had ever seen.My brother and I were desperate to get out. We’d hang around the checkpoints, hoping to befriend a West Berliner. Occasionally, they took pity and sent us packages. But escaping was rare – and expensive. Most who managed it had paid thousands of marks.That year, after I finished school, my father found me a job in a bookshop. Tourists often came: they were required to spend a minimum of 15 marks each time they visited the east. With little else to buy, many opted for books or records.One day in March, two French military officers came in. As I chatted with them, I could tell they liked me. I thought they seemed like decent men so I said, “Can you help me?” Just that. They looked at me and said, “No problem”, and left.That night, I couldn’t sleep. I thought I’d never see them again. But the next day, they came back. They walked over and whispered, “Tonight or never. Meet us in the alley near the shop. Eight-thirty.”Once the shop emptied, I locked up and went home. My heart was thudding. I ran upstairs to the attic, and grabbed my passport and a few sentimental pieces of jewellery. I told my parents I was going to the cinema with a friend. As I left, I took one more look at them sitting down to dinner, knowing it might be the last time I saw them in person. I felt torn apart by grief, guilt, fear – but also strangely numb. I had to block it all out.I went to the alley. When the officers saw me, they gestured to the boot of the car. I told them that after we crossed the border they should take me to my uncle’s home – he had escaped before the wall went up. Then I climbed in, curling my legs into my chest. I wondered if my brother could have fitted in there with me.View image in fullscreenGabriele Paissoni (second right) with her family in East Berlin.Photograph: Gabriele PaissoniI felt every bump in the road, each one a shock. My eyes never adjusted to the pitch black; the smell of rubber and exhaust fumes filled my nose. I could just about make out some muffled speech from the front seat.Then the car stopped. More muffled voices. I made out a few words: “First checkpoint, hold your breath.” I imagined soldiers waving them through as the car moved again. “Second checkpoint, hold your breath.” Then again: “Third checkpoint, hold your breath.” Then the car was back in motion.And that was it. My life changed in 15 minutes. When we arrived at my uncle’s home, his wife opened the door and froze. She hugged me tightly. “Do you know what could have happened?” she said. “You could’ve ended up in a security prison.” She was right. People who were caught often faced brutal punishments. Some were tortured. Many were shot dead.The next day, I sent my family a one-word telegram: “Sorry.” I wanted to explain everything. Tell them how much I missed them, how hard it was to leave. But I couldn’t say more – the police might have interrogated them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Holidays were the hardest. I’d imagine them all gathered together – birthdays, Christmases – while I was alone in a new world. There was always a deep homesickness that never fully left.When theBerlin Wallcame down, I was living in London – I’d moved there just months after my escape.I started out as an au pair and over time, built a life. I got married, raised two children, and eventually bought a house in Hammersmith, where I live today. I’m retired now and spend time with my grandchildren. I enjoy the simple things – things I once could have only dreamed of.My brother never managed to escape. He later became a GP in East Berlin and lived there for the rest of his life. He died this August. My sisters were among some of the first people to legally fly to London with an East Berlin passport. It was November 1989, just weeks after the wall came down, when they arrived – I burst into tears. It felt like a piece of me had been restored.As told to Hanna McNeilaDo you have an experience to share?

A writer and consultant working in beauty and tech, their projects include abeauty newsletter, a creative collective calledPerfumed Pagesand a non-profit arts project called theMuseum of Nails Foundation. In their new book, they examine the impact of the $450bn beauty industry – the pretty and the very ugly.Sicardi has written about beauty as “a terrorizing force” for their whole career, including a stint as a beauty editor at BuzzFeed, which proved a spiky learning experience. “I wrote a story critical of an advertising campaign andthen got flak for it,”they recall. “I decided to leave because I didn’t want to deal with the politics and the insincerity of being told I can do something, but then having my work deleted. That type of situation still happens very regularly to writers for publications to this day,” they said.In an era of unrealistic beauty standards, such ambivalence needs little explanation. But Sicardi interweaves deeper strands: the beauty industry’s relationship to the climate crisis, the markup on basic goods like shampoo in US prisons and how the history of nail salons in the US relates to the Vietnam war.Yet Sicardi describes themselves as “devoted to telling stories about the beauty industry” because of its ability to bring people together and provide comfort – as with themonthly nail appointmentsthey describe as “one of the only indulgences I could afford” in their early 20s.I spoke to Sicardi about the beauty industry’s hideous parts: exploitative work conditions, overconsumption and Coco Chanel’s links to fascism. Our conversation was edited for length and clarity.The first chapter in The House of Beauty is a “choose your own adventure”-style tale navigating the manufacturing, marketing and sales process of a beauty product. How did you come up with that structure?I wanted to showcase how complicated and interconnected the beauty industry is to so many other industries, in a way that people could play through with friends and talk about and understand there’s infinite possibilities – and they’re all interconnected.I think people come in with a set of expectations of what writing about beauty should look like, and I wanted to throw that out the window and violently explode it before they proceeded to the rest of the book.You don’t shy away from devastating facts in that chapter – you refer to workers’ deaths and child labor. It’s affecting and pretty stressful to read.That was intentional. I did multiple interviews a week for years, with people all around the world, with three translators, via email and Zoom and in person. I interviewed every type of person that’s mentioned: auditors, NGO people that directly interact with and record the deaths of child laborers, farmers, retail associates, cosmetic chemists, lawyers, CEOs. I didn’t talk to the assassin [one vignette features the point of view of an assassin who kills a lawyer representing peasant farmers in Honduras] – unfortunately, they were not easily accessible.Ultimately, we are all participants and complicit in how beauty is produced throughout the world. I wanted the reader to be immediately implicated in the story, like you are the final girl in this horror movie.The current political moment illustrates how fashion, beauty andfascismare intertwined. But your chapter about Coco Chanel – who had a Nazi lover andtried to use Nazi lawsin order to wrest control of her perfume business from its Jewish owners – shows that it’s not unique to the present.I’ve always been fascinated with the story of Chanel, because I didn’t really understand why this huge part of her history was swept away. But being confused by it was a kind of naivety about how power relations work and how beneficial complicity is to people who are afraid of moral consequences.The not-so secret language of fascist fashionRead moreFor years, I wondered why she did not use her power to effect better kinds of change given the circumstances. But she was never going to be a good person. She didn’t grow up surrounded by people with different politics around her. She grew up in antisemitism in a time where that was pretty normal and normalized, and the people that she found value and camaraderie with believed the same thing that she did. She lived in a very particular privileged bubble, and wanted to continue to live in the bubble the worse the world got.I think a lot of people probably relate a little too much to Chanel, frankly, in this day and age. I wanted to tell a story of how complicated her life was, and how much the questions she was confronted with are questions that we are also confronted with. It’s certainly not a chapter that excuses her behavior. It’s not a feelgood chapter, but I thought it was a really important story on how we have to hold ourselves accountable.Despite its darker sides, you also write about the sense of community the beauty world can foster. How has it done that for you personally?I see beauty as a tool for connection and opportunity. A lot of the time, as I’ve reported in this book, it’s used to exploit us and other times it is used to bring us together and take care of the most vulnerable. I used to do mutual aid fundraisers by collecting beauty products from different magazines’ beauty closets, and pooling these resources and putting the money towards bail funds, abortion funds and immigrant legal funds.I really love fragrance, and I am doing fragrance swaps as part of the book tour, as a way to share resources and materials. It’s like a gateway to community. People leave with more than they came with: new friends or opportunities for friendships.

I don’t do brand sponsorships or collaborations, even though I came from an influencer background and I grew up as an OG influencer. I have loyalty to people and to the stories that we want to share together. That doesn’t make me brand friendly, but it does mean that I am more likely to foster community and people want to show up because we share the same ideals.You cite a statistic that Americans are spending $3,342 on beauty services and cosmetics a year, on average. But items like soap and toothpaste are a necessity. So what do we do? How do we make ethical choices?I don’t have a perfect answer, but it’s not about perfection – it’s about progress.I am not going to say that it’s up to the individual consumer – that would be such a disservice to the scale of the problem and our individual agency. You can DIY your own products for the rest of your life and recycle properly and be a complete martyr of pure, ethical, moral good and it will still not make a dent in comparison to Elon Musk’s personal habits over the course of an hour. The scale of power and waste between 1% of the world to everyone else is so wildly disproportionate.But that isn’t a license for us to just keep buying whatever we want. Being defeatist doesn’t serve any of us. It’s really about figuring out the best-case scenario for you and for your immediate community, sharing that knowledge and having a long-term actionable goal that you all work towards together.But here’s an easy thing to do: you don’t need one-use products, like sheet masks. Bar soap takes up less resources. You don’t necessarily need a 15-step skin care routine. You simply use less and keep it moving.book coverWhy did you decide to conclude the book discussing this idea of care and community?Well, I needed to not go insane. From the beginning draft to the early reads, it was a 10-year process, which is a gloriously privileged amount of time to spend on any creative project. At least five or six of those years were dedicated to researching and sitting in some of the worst things that we’ve done to each other as humans. I didn’t want to break my own heart infinitely, so I needed to find a balance.I had to sit and ask myself, like, it’s not all horrible, right? I had to find the light throughout the stories and collect it for myself. My guiding force and my guiding principle was that beauty is terror but it’s also an act of care, and that matters as much.Care always exists even in precarity, and that’s something I had to remind myself in the end. I didn’t want to leave everyone feeling devastated, because that’s not where I landed either.The House of Beautyby Arabelle Sicardi is available now via WW Norton.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyBeautyMakeupClimate crisisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Often made with ground nuts instead of flour, this gives them a fudgy, moist texture. Here, ripe pears sink gently into a dark chocolate and hazelnut batter, with the flavours of vanilla, almond and cardamom subtly enhancing the depth of the chocolate and teasing out the fruit’s perfume.Pear, chocolate and hazelnut tortePrep10 minCook1 hr 15 min,plus coolingServes8-10150g blanched hazelnuts200g dark chocolate(about 70% cocoa), roughly chopped150g unsalted butter, cubed150g soft brown sugar1 tsp vanilla extract½ tsp almond extract4 large eggs, separated¼ tsp fine sea salt¾ tsp ground cardamom(from the seeds of 12-18 pods)2 small ripe pears(conference, williams), peeled, quartered and coredTo finishIcing sugar, for dustingCreme fraiche or ice-cream, to serveHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and line the base and sides of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking paper.Put the hazelnuts on a small baking tray and toast in the oven for five to eight minutes, until light golden and fragrant. Leave them to cool, then blitz in a food processor until finely ground, but with a few nubbly bits for texture.Put the chocolate and butter in a medium heatproof bowl set over but not touching a pan of barely simmering water. Stir gently until melted and smooth, then take off the heat. Add the brown sugar, vanilla and almond extracts, and whisk gently to combine. Leave to cool for about five minutes, then add the egg yolks and whisk gently to incorporate. Fold in the ground hazelnuts, salt and cardamom.Put the eggs whites in the clean bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high until soft peaks form. Stir a spoonful into the chocolate batter to loosen it, then gently fold in the rest in two batches. Keep a light hand while doing this, to retain as much air in the mix as possible.Scrape the batter into the prepared cake tin. Slice each quartered piece of pear thinly but not all the way through the top, so they hold together, then arrange the pears, slightly overlapping, on top of the batter. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until set around the edges and the centre is still slightly wobbly. The pears will sink a little as the torte bakes.Leave to cool in the tin, then release and transfer to a serving plate. Dust lightly with icing sugar and serve at room temperature with creme fraiche or ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotCakeDessertFruitChocolateWinter food and drinkBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

Talking publicly about my experience helps lift the veil of secrecy surrounding itTomas TelegrammaFri 7 Nov 2025 18.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 18.02 ESTShareNothing in my life sparks greater joy and deeper shame than food. Publicly, I live and love to eat. As a food writer my livelihood depends on it. But privately, I live with a binge-eating disorder, and it can feel like what I’m devouring is actually devouring me.My family is Italian, and their love language is food, so food is also the portal to all my memories, good and bad. Nonna’s lasagne at Easter, her zeppole at Christmas, were the best of times. The worst: foil trays piled with fried food at funerals, the liquorice allsorts I ate – and now hate – after my infant brother choked and paramedics rushed him to hospital. Emotional eating has always been so normal for me.As a kid, I got a thrill out of smuggling chocolates into the bathroom, locking the door, downing them in quick succession then hiding the wrappers.A binge is like a runaway train: fast, uncontrollable, not stopping for anythingIn my last year of school I experienced drastic weight gain, then equally drastic weight loss soon after – by depriving myself of calories and exercising to exhaustion. I got caught in a vicious cycle.That level of restriction was unmaintainable, but every day thereafter I tried. Most days I failed. The instant something I deemed “unhealthy” hit my lips, all bets were off.At first, gorging myself on all manner of deliciousness I could find felt like a pressure valve, a euphoric guilty pleasure that onlookers saw purely as a feast. But as it became a regular occurrence, increasingly in private, the pleasure started to fade. With each binge – yet another perceived failure – the self-soothing morphed into self-loathing.A binge is like a runaway train: fast, uncontrollable, not stopping for anything.There’s also nothing indulgent about it, going to bed as your stomach stretches achingly taut. It’s insufferable. And going cold turkey isn’t an option.A decade ago, my food “noise” – an insatiable, inescapable inner monologue – was turned up to full blast when I started writing about food while studying journalism. In many ways it made sense, converting passion to profession. I already had food on my mind constantly. Now my career was crystallising around it.It’s Australia’s most common eating disorder, but nothing has isolated me moreI panic-emailed the Butterfly Foundation, which specialises in eating disorders. That led to me being diagnosed and treated for a few years pre-Covid, but keeping a journal of everything I ate between sessions just felt like my fixation taking a different form.Through Melbourne’s lockdowns, I worked from home as a full-time editor in food media, my job and my disordered eating feeding each other. By day, I covered restaurants pivoting to takeaway. By night, I would binge on that very same takeaway.Coming out of lockdown, socialising was tough and industry dinners were triggering. I’d be so in my head about overeating in front of colleagues and peers that I’d try to slow my racing thoughts with alcohol. One night, arriving home inhibition-less, I consumed whatever I could find, joylessly and out of sheer desperation. I vomited violently, bursting blood vessels in my eyes, turning the whites red.Barely anyone knows this, because much of what makes binge eating so brutal isn’t just the disorder itself. It’s the veil of shameful secrecy that surrounds it. The more you binge, the more alone you feel, and the more alone you feel, the more you binge. It’s Australia’s most common eating disorder, but nothing has isolated me more.I had no idea where to find help for my eating disorder. Then Australia’s new e-clinic changed everything | Lucinda PriceRead moreMy most successful recovery so far came when I quit my job, taking three circuit-breaking months off to build more balanced habits. I focused on eating three meals a day with two snacks, as my clinician had suggested years prior; it seems simple, but it was a gamechanger in binge prevention. With what felt like a clean slate, I rediscovered my love for writing about food, as a freelancer.Binge eating now has me in far less of a chokehold than it once did. But there are still days when I’d give anything to quiet the food noise. Reconciling my career with my condition, I’m learning not to be ashamed by the obsession, and the endless internal chatter, but to harness it, to understand it.Because after half a lifetime of waging war on myself – mind and body – if there’s one thing I know about shame, it’s that it thrives in the shadows. So, what if I let the light in?In Australia, theButterfly Foundationhas free and confidential support for eating disorders, by calling 1800 33 4673. In the US, help is available at nationaleatingdisorders.org or by calling ANAD’s eating disorders hotline at 800-375-7767.

Proliferating glossy magazines celebrated revived couture, promoted luxury goods and displayed them on perfect human specimens in ideal settings. They did not care for, or cater to, the young, poor or inventive. Youthful street daywear was not their business.But there was another magazine world – notably the Face and i-D – which had come out of music and pop culture. By the late 80s, freelancers for these, especially the stylist Melanie Ward, just out of college, were experimenting with emphatically different clothes and the ways to wear them, to create photographs that were more than an alternative to perfection. They proposed a realism that dominated the future presentation of fashion.View image in fullscreenThe Face cover of July 1990 featuring Kate Moss, the shoot for which was styled by Ward.Photograph: The FaceWard, who has died aged 64 of cancer, was the creative force behind the Face’s revolutionary “3rd Summer of Love” cover and sequence in July 1990. The then-current concept of a carefree beach pic wasPeter Lindbergh’sshot of six tanned, strapping supermodels in sun and surf at Santa Monica, wearing big white shirts, mostly linen. (Think of the ironing, a task for a stylist.) Ward and the photographerCorinne Daytook the recently discovered Kate Moss, aged 16, to scrubby Camber Sands on the English south coast, where they dressed Moss up in Ward’s choice mix of unironed clothes, which she recalled as “some mine, some vintage, customised, even some designer” plus unchic Birkenstock sandals and a feather head-dress. Moss contributed her grin and skin, occasionally goosebumped with chill.The resultant pictures were no less professional than a couture studio-shot for Vogue, but in showing a cheeky woman having a cheap good time in what seemed her own wardrobe, they were what we would now call relatable. Ward said her choices were “character-driven” – which is how movie costume designers work, rather than fashion editors then – and that they were about “a democratic freedom to express yourself, be different and also be true to yourself”. She had always known what to put together and how, and used her knowledge just when a stylist – previously the fashion show or shoot fixer, gofer and dogsbody – was becoming as important to imagery as the photographer.As this novel sort of stylist, Ward pre-selected from an ever-increasing amount of garments available across brands, like a DJ choosing among new releases; she said “the street, fashion and music were inextricably linked”. She collected old or odd pieces anywhere, from Oxfam shops (a source for grunge before that mode got its name) to Portobello Road stalls, and made others herself: the words “stylist’s own” in the captions often described the most desirable item in her pictures. She observed how ordinary people in London streets wore fusion outfits, cardigan over sari, anorak with a thobe robe.Above all, Ward’s styling was about attitude – her chosen models had to show they were wearing the clothes and not the clothes them: they came over as fierce, or cracking up with real laughter, previously not-done. She ignored long-established fashion criteria in her own appearance and in shoots – no visibly “done” hair and make-up, expensive exclusive details. As the journalist Marion Hume wrote on encountering Ward in 1993, she did not “look important … smart and shiny no longer means power. Watch the person who looks thrown together … who has no passing acquaintance with a comb.”The anti-glam, even dirty realist, mood soon became the mode. When Hume met Ward, in an army surplus jacket with “hair tugged back in an elastic band”, she had just been approached by Calvin Klein and Jil Sander. In addition, a young Helmut Lang had sent a fan letter to Ward, via the wrong magazine, which eventually reached her. They met and she forthwith became his muse and creative partner for 13 years, working on ads with the photographer David Sims; her creative input took many forms – she bought Lang a pair of boy’s black school uniform trousers from John Lewis to recut, and the resultant “boy-tailored pants” became a Lang standard.View image in fullscreenA Ward-styled black leather outfit at a Helmut Lang fashion show in New York, September 2000.Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersFor the rest of her life, Ward styled shows and ads for many major houses including Chanel, Dior, Lanvin,Armani, Gucci, Versace and Prada, and was for a while a creative director withKarl Lagerfeld’s own line. And she produced work for Nike, Levi’s, and, less expectedly, for Apple. (Ward hated the word “minimalist” but grudgingly accepted “modernist”.)In 1995, the fashion establishment, in the stately form of US Harper’s Bazaar, had invited her to join it as senior fashion editor, where she remained until 2009. The appointment acknowledged that her vision of how clothes possibly could, not definitely should, be worn by imperfect, unimportant people had permanently changed the presentation of fashion. She put together high and very low labels, vintage, rawest streetwear, museum pieces and tat that went beyond dodgy taste into comedy.Ward was born in Whitechapel, and her view of London and its people skewed from its east. Her father, Les Ward, worked in retail; to her mother, Honor, a headteacher, Ward attributed her lifelong interest in clothes, which Ward learned young to make, or make over. She attended the Ursuline high school in Ilford, and recalled being enthusiastically naughty at the convent.After gaining a London University degree in politics and languages, she realised that the college-era evenings she had spent at her sewing machine pointed to her metier, and studied at Central Saint Martins, where she won an award for daywear. (In 2010 Ward briefly designed for her own ready-to-wear label, Blouson Noir, but never enjoyed the manufacturing side of the business.) Her own style – quiet but absolute and sure – soon brought her styling work.Imperfect Beauty, an exhibition about contemporary fashion photography at the Victoria & Albert Museum in 2000 put Ward’s name, as stylist, on captions along with the photographer’s: a breakthrough.Ward is survived by her father.Melanie Ward, fashion stylist and editor, born 17 June 1961; died 22 October 2025Explore more on these topicsFashionobituariesShareReuse this content"

Women sit elbow-to-elbow beneath shopfronts, hands outstretched as artists swirl cones of henna into intricate curls. For £5, you can walk away with both palms blooming. Once confined to weddings and living rooms, this centuries-old ritual has spilled out into public spaces – and today, it’s being reimagined entirely.In recent years, henna has travelled from family homes to the red carpet – from actor Michaela Coel’sSudanese motifsat the Toronto film festival to Katseye singer Lara Raj’s henna decor at the 2025 Video Music awards. Younger generations are using it as art,political expressionandcultural affirmation. Online, the appetite is increasing – UK searches for henna reportedly rose by nearly 5,000%last year; and, on social media, creators share everything fromfaux frecklesmade with henna tofive-minute floral designtutorials, showing how the dye has adapted to modern beauty culture.Yet, for many of us, the relationship with henna – a paste pressed into cones and used to temporarily stain skin – hasn’t always been uncomplicated. I remember sitting in salons in Birmingham when I was a teenager, my hands adorned with fresh henna that my mother insisted would make me look “presentable” for special occasions, weddings or Eid. At the park, strangers asked if my little brother had scribbled on me. After painting my nails with henna once, a classmate asked if I had frostbite. For years after, I hesitated to wear it, self-conscious it would draw unwanted attention. But now, like many other young people of colour, I feel a stronger sense of pride, and find myself wanting my hands decorated with it more often.View image in fullscreenReclaiming the form … the members of artist collective HuqThat.Photograph: Arshpreet KhangurhaThis idea of reclaiming henna from cultural erasure and appropriation resonates withHuqThat, a six-member artist collective based in London redefining henna as a legitimate art form. Founded in 2018, HuqThat’s work has adorned the hands of singers such as Joy Crookes and they have worked with Nike and Converse. “There’s been a cultural shift,” says Ruqaiyyah Patel, who joined the collective two years ago. “People are really proud nowadays. They might have dealt with racism, but now they are coming back to it.”Henna, derived from theLawsonia inermisshrub, has coloured skin, fabric and hair for more than 5,000 years across Africa, south Asia and the Middle East. Early traces have even been found on the bodies of Egyptian mummies. Known asmehndi, ḥinnāʾ, lalleand more depending on region or language, its uses are vast: to cool the body, dye beards, bless newlyweds, or to simply beautify. But beyond aesthetics, it has long been a vessel for community and self-expression; a way for people to gather and proudly wear culture on their bodies.View image in fullscreenHenna designs by HuqThat.Photograph: HuqThat“Henna is for the masses,” says Patel. “It comes from working people, from villagers who grow the plant.” Her colleague, Nuzhat El Agabani, adds: “We want people to understand henna as a legitimate art form, just like calligraphy.”Their work has appeared at fundraisers for Palestine and Sudan, as well as at Pride events. “We wanted to make it an inclusive space for everyone, especially queer and trans people who might have felt excluded from these traditions,” says El Agabani. “Henna is such an intimate thing – you’re entrusting the artist to look after part of your body. For queer people, that can be stressful if you don’t know who’s safe.”Their approach mirrors henna’s versatility: “Sudanese henna is different from Ethiopian, north Indian to south Indian,” says El Agabani. “We tailor the designs to what each person connects with most,” adds Patel. Clients, who vary in age and background, are encouraged to bring personal references: jewellery, poetry, fabric patterns. “Rather than copying online designs, I want to give them opportunities to have henna that they haven’t seen before.”ForAminata Mboup, an industrial designer and sculptor based in Toronto and Dakar, Senegal,fuddën(henna in Wolof) connects her to her Senegalese roots. She uses jagua, a natural dye from the jenipapo, a tropical fruit native to the Americas, that stains deep blue-black. “The darkened fingertips were something my grandmother always had,” she says. “When I wear it, I feel as if I’m stepping into womanhood, a sign of grace and elegance.”View image in fullscreenMultidisciplinary artist Aminata Mboup displays her henna designs.Photograph: Courtesy of Aminata MboupMboup, who has garnered attention on social media by showcasing her stained hands and personal style, now frequently wears henna in her everyday life. “It’s important to have it outside special occasions,” she says. “I perform my Blackness every day, and this is one of the ways I do that.” She describes it as a declaration of identity: “I have a sign of where I’m from and who I am right here on my hands, which I use for everything, every day.”Applying henna has become meditative, she says. “It forces you to pause, to sit with yourself and connect with people that came before you. In a world that’s always rushing, there’s joy and rest in that.”View image in fullscreenPavan Ahluwalia-Dhanjal, founder of the world’s first henna bar.Photograph: Omer JanjuaPavan Ahluwalia-Dhanjal, founder of the world’s first henna bar, in London’s Selfridges, and holder of two Guinness World Records for fastest henna application, recognises its multiplicity: “People use it as a political thing, a cultural thing, or just for beauty – and I respect all of that.” She began experimenting with it at a family wedding. “No one took me seriously, not even my own culture,” she says. “People knew they could probably get it done cheaper in a nearby shop or house.” Then, when she went on Dragons’ Den in 2024, “I was told henna wouldn’t go beyond my community. But for the first six years, most customers weren’t from my culture at all.”Ahluwalia-Dhanjal says her henna bar has attracted “tourists and western people” and, only in the past couple of years, people of south Asian background. “I now have a team of 25 pro-artists who do henna workshops across the UK and fly to Los Angeles,” she says. She wants henna to be “as accessible as lipstick or nail polish”. “It’s a beauty staple,” she says.Its newfound visibility hasn’t come without tension; the fine line between appreciation and appropriation is often blurred when people borrow the art without understanding its roots. Ahluwalia-Dhanjal is pragmatic: “Some people think it’s only for festivals, weddings or south Asian people. The fact that it’s consistently sold throughout the year says a lot about how many cultures appreciate henna.”Across continents and generations, henna’s meaning continues to stain deeply. For Mboup, this is the point. “Henna reminds me that there’s strength and virtue in what is concealed and protected. It’s a stain – and it’s mine.”Explore more on these topicsFashionBody imageMakeupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The city is dotted with Humana shops for staple wardrobe finds; there’s theEcseri flea marketfor the more unusual (interspersed with the occasional plastic Stalin bust); plus chic, rambling stores likeSzputnyikandRetrock Vintage– think racks of leather jackets and tulle tops among giant monstera plants. Antiques shops are also found tucked away, their contents spilling on to the pavements outside. A particularly favourite find was a set of intricate hand-painted embroidery layouts on kraft paper from the 1930s, each signed by the artist.KatieLyon’s canalside treasure troveView image in fullscreenTheLes Puces du Canalflea market, in the Villeurbanne suburb on the Canal de Jonage, is a treasure trove for reasonably priced vintage clothes, 1960s paraphernalia and vintage furniture (much of the latter still falling in the sub-€150 category).

For reasons beyond my control – mostly life, work and weather – it’s been far from my best. I’ve hobbled along, trying to keep my cool when my trays of seed have barely germinated and while attempting to rescue root-bound plants that I’d somehow forgotten about. I’ve come to the realisation that it’s fine to have an off year as long as you embrace it. As the saying – often attributed to Buddha – goes, pain is inevitable but suffering is optional.For me, that’s meant welcoming as many “volunteer plants” as I have space for. The term is often used as a kind synonym for weeds, but I use it to mean plants growing where I hadn’t planned for them to be. And given that I mulch with compost made from my garden waste and kitchen scraps, and leave my crops to flower and self-seed, unexpected plants always pop up.My most plentiful volunteer plant this year has been the tomato. They’re easy to identify as they emerge with their purple-hued, fuzzy stems, and although most grew into scrawny plants, they did yield enough cherry tomatoes to justify their presence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The past me would have weeded them out immediately given that, as monoecious plants (having both male and female sex organs), they’re liable to cross-pollination, which results in bitter, unpleasantly textured or unusually shaped – and in very rare instances toxic – fruit. But I decided to let these ones grow as their flowers were a welcome addition for the pollinators and likely meant a better chance of successful pollination – and thus, fruit – on the squash plants I’d grown intentionally.The most welcome plants appearing around the veg beds have been the raspberry canes. These are the next generation of the raspberries I planted three years ago, which have spread their roots so far they’ve left the perennial bed where they first grew. They’re a mixture of summer and autumn fruiting varieties, so some bore fruit this year, and I’m planning to move the rest – as they ought to bear fruit next year – into the freshly weeded and mulched raspberry bed, repopulating that piece of ground before it freezes.It’s been an unconventional approach to keeping my veg patch filled with life, but by letting things be and embracing “what is”, the garden has played host to various species I haven’t seen here before, including a cacophony of grasshoppers, a stunningly gilded slow worm and a nest of ground bees that made their home amid a patch of marjoram. Not bad for season marked by failure.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensTomatoesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

JD Vance had been scheduled to attend in Trump’s place, but a person familiar with Vance’s plans who was granted anonymity to talk about his schedule said Vance would no longer travel there for the summit.“It is a total disgrace that the G20 will be held in SouthAfrica,” Trump said on his social media site. In his post, Trump cited “abuses” of Afrikaners, including violence and death as well as confiscation of their land and farms.The Trump administration has long accused the South African government of allowing minority white Afrikaner farmers to be persecuted and attacked. As it restricted the number of refugees admitted annually to the US to 7,500, the administration indicated that most will be white South Africans who it claimed faced discrimination and violence at home.But the government of South Africa has said it is surprised by the accusations of discrimination, because white people in the country generally have a much higher standard of living than its Black residents, more than three decades after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule.The country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said he’s told Trump that information about the alleged discrimination and persecution of Afrikaners is “completely false”.Nonetheless, the administration has kept up its criticisms of the South African government. Earlier this week during an economic speech in Miami, Trump said South Africa should be thrown out of the Group of 20.Earlier this year, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, boycotted aG20meeting for foreign ministers because its agenda focused on diversity, inclusion and climate change efforts.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSouth AfricaAfricaG20newsShareReuse this content"

This must stop,” she said. “Ending all operational communication with the so-called Libyan Rescue Coordination Center is both a legal and moral necessity – a clear line against European complicity in crimes against humanity.”The organisations acknowledged that the decision could result in them facing fines, detentions and the confiscation of their rescue vessels.Giulia Messmer, of Berlin-based Sea-Watch, said: “It is not only our right but our duty to treat armed militias as such in our operational communication – not as legitimate actors in search-and-rescue operations.”In the past 10 years, rescue organisations operating in the Mediterranean have saved more than 155,000 people from drowning.In doing so, they have come under increased pressure; campaigners have criticised an escalatingcrackdownon them by Italy, where hardline rules have blocked vessels from leaving port for acollective totalof more than 700 days, while in August, Libya’s coastguardwas accusedof firing on a vessel belonging to SOS Méditerranée.A report published last month by Sea-Watchaccused the Libyan coastguard of 54 violent incidentssince 2016, including shootings, ramming vessels, and threatening and assaulting people in distress.The search-and-rescue organisations said this week that they had launched a new alliance, the Justice Fleet, whose website would track incidents involving the Libyan coastguard and compile information on legal cases pursued by the NGOs.The NGOs behind the alliance – the largest group of civil search-and-rescue organisations to date – described it as a means of pushing back against the escalating pressure they faced.“For 10 years, civil sea rescue has been providing first aid in the Mediterranean. For that, we have been blocked, criminalised, slandered,” the Justice Fleet websitesaid. “That’s why we are joining forces now, stronger than ever – to defend human rights and international maritime law together.”Explore more on these topicsRefugeesEuropeMigrationHuman rights (Law)Human rights (Global development)LibyaEuropean UnionnewsShareReuse this content"

Thousands of the city’s residents are missing.An internal British government paper, prepared last year, detailed four options for increasing “the protection of civilians, including atrocity prevention” in Sudan.The options, evaluated by officials from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in autumn last year, included the introduction of an “international protection mechanism” to safeguard civilians from crimes against humanity and sexual violence.However, because of aid cuts, FCDO officials chose the “least ambitious” plan toprotect Sudanese civilians.View image in fullscreenA satellite image showing fires and smoke around El Fasher, Sudan, after Rapid Support Forces paramilitaries took over the city and surrounding villages in Darfur.Photograph: Vantor/EPAAreportdated October 2025, documenting the decision, said: “Given resource constraints, [the UK] has opted to take the least ambitious approach to the prevention of atrocities, including CRSV [conflicted-related sexual violence].”Shayna Lewis, a Sudan specialist with the US-based human rights organisationPaema(Preventing and Ending Mass Atrocities), said: “Atrocities are not natural disasters – they are a political choice that are preventable if there is political will.“The FCDO’s decision [to pursue the least ambitious option for atrocity prevention] clearly shows the lack of priority this government places on atrocity prevention globally, but this has real-life consequences.“Now the UK government is complicit in the ongoing genocide of the people of Darfur,” she said.The British government’s approach to Sudan is considered important for many reasons, including its role as “penholder” for the country at the UN security council – meaning it leads the council’s activities on the conflict that has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.Details of the options paper were cited in a review of British assistance to Sudan between 2019 and mid-2025 by Liz Ditchburn, head of the body that scrutinises UK aid spending.Her report for the Independent Commission forAidImpact (ICAI) said the most ambitious atrocity-prevention plan for Sudan was not taken up partly because of “constraints in terms of resourcing and staffing”.It stated that an FCDO “internal options paper” outlined four broad options but concluded that “an already overstretched country team did not have the capacity to take on a complex new programming area”.View image in fullscreenDisplaced Sudanese in the Um Yanqur camp in the western Darfur region after fleeing El Fasher.Photograph: AFP/GettyInstead, officials chose “the fourth – and least ambitious – option”, which involved allocating an additional £10m funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other organisations “for various activities, including protection”.The report also found that funding constraints compromised the UK’s ability to offer better protection for women and girls.Sudan’s conflict has been characterised by widespreadsexual violence against women and girls, evidenced by new testimonies from those fleeing El Fasher.“This [the funding cuts] has constrained the UK’s ability to support stronger protection results within Sudan – including for women and girls,” the report stated.It added that a proposal to make sexual violence a priority had been hindered by “funding constraints and limited programme management capacity”.‘They killed civilians in their beds’: chaos and brutality reign after fall of El FasherRead moreA promised programme for Sudanese women and girls would, it concluded, be ready only “in the medium to long term (from 2026)”.Sarah Champion, chair of the parliamentaryinternational development select committee, said atrocity prevention should be fundamental to British foreign policy.“I am deeply concerned that in the rush to save money, some essential services are getting cut,” she said. “Prevention and early intervention should be core to all FCDO work, but sadly they are often seen as a ‘nice to have’.”The Labour MP added: “In a time of a rapidly reducing aid budgets, this is a dangerously shortsighted approach to take.”Ditchburn’s appraisal did, however, highlight some positives for the British government. “The UK has shown credible political leadership and strong convening power on Sudan, but its impact has been constrained by inconsistent political attention,” it read.UK sources say its aid is “making a difference on the ground” with more than £120 million awarded to Sudan and that the UK is working with international partners to achieve peace.They also referred to a recent UK statement at the UN Security Council which promised that the “world will hold the RSF leadership accountable for the crimes committed by their forces”.The RSF denies harming civilians.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the

There was no immediate comment from Mexico.The alleged plot would have taken place after Israel on 1 April 2024 attacked the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus,Syria, then a close ally of Tehran, killing several top officers of the Revolutionary Guards.That attack prompted vows of revenge by Iran, which fired missiles and drones against Israel.Israel a year later carried out a much more extensive bombing campaign in Iran, which killed more than 1,000 people. The United States, Israel’s main ally, joined by bombing key sites of Iran’s contested nuclear program.Iran’s cleric-run state has been a critical supporter of Hamas, the armed Palestinian militant group in Gaza that carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.Israel responded with a relentless campaign that has left most of Gaza in rubble and expanded its military offensive across the region, hitting Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Qatar and Yemen.Israeli intelligence has accused the Quds Force of plotting against Israeli and Jewish targets overseas.Australia expelled Iran’s ambassador over what it said was Iranian involvement in two arson attacks – against a synagogue in Melbourne and a kosher restaurant in Sydney.Latin America is not a stranger to violence linked to the Middle East. A bombing at a Jewish center in 1994 in Buenos Aires killed 85 people, with Argentina and Israel saying it was carried out by Lebanese militant group Hezbollah at the request of Iran.Iran remains home to a historic Jewish community despite the hostility to Israel by the cleric-run government that took power with the 1979 Islamic revolution.Mexico, also home to a major Jewish community, has recognized Israel since the early days of the state’s existence.Mexico, which favors non-intervention in international affairs, has taken a more cautious stance on the Gaza war than other leftist-led Latin American countries, backing an investigation into allegations of Israeli war crimes but maintaining diplomatic relations.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMexicoSyriaAmericasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Organized by the subnational climate coalitions America Is All In, Climate Mayors, and the US Climate Alliance, the group will also include the Wisconsin governor, Tony Evers, Phoenix mayor, Kate Gallego, and others.No high-level US representatives will go to UN climate talks, Trump officials sayRead more“This is a mighty coalition representing some two-thirds of Americans, three quarters of our GDP and over 50% of greenhouse gas emissions,” said Todd Stern, formerly special envoy for climate change under Barack Obama.States are competing in a “friendly race to the top”, said Grisham, working to slash planet-heating pollution while boosting their economies.“I hope that this is contagious,” she said.The press call came one day after elections across the US, which delivered broad success for Democrats and progressives.“Over 30 climate mayors won last night,” said Gina McCarthy, who served as a climate adviser to Joe Biden and environment chief under Obama.On the call, Grisham said New Mexico has in recent years increased oil and gas production but cut its methane output in half.“We are showing that all of the above is here today,” she said, referring to a policy approach that supports the development and use of renewables and fossil fuels alike, whichDonald Trumphas eschewed.Yet topUnited Nationsclimate experts havelongwarnedthat climate action requires the rapid phaseout of fossil fuels. That is one reason Keanu Arpels-Josiah, lead organizer with youth-led activist group Fridays For Future NYC, was so excited by Zohran Mamdani’swinin the New York City mayoral election this week. A self-described ecosocialist, Mamdani has been a vocal backer of policies tophase fossil fuels out of buildingsand efforts tostop the buildout of a gas pipeline.“He really stands in contrast to many Democratic governors who are trying to claim climate leadership … while continuing to push forward fossil fuel expansion in their states,” Arpels-Josiah, who plans to attendCop30, said. At the climate talks, his organization will highlight Mamdani’s win as a sign that Americans are ready for “true climate-justice aligned policy” that “pushes towards the end of fossil fuel extractivism”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

If you keep trafficking deadly drugs – we will kill you,” he wrote.Like some previous videos released by the US government, a section of the boat is obfuscated for unspecified reasons.President Donald Trump’s administration has built upsignificant forces in Latin America, in what it says is its campaign to stamp out drug trafficking.So far it has deployed six Navy ships in the Caribbean, sent F-35 stealth warplanes to Puerto Rico, andordered the USS Gerald R Ford carrier strike group to the region.On Thursday, the US Senateblocked a Democratic war powers resolutionthat would have forced Donald Trump to seek congressional approval to launch strikes in Venezuela, allowing the president to remain unchecked in his ability to expand his military campaign against the country.The administration has developed a range of options for military action inVenezuela, according to two people familiar with the matter, and Trump’s aides have asked the justice department for additional guidance that could provide a legal basis to strike targets other than boats.The governments and families of those killed in the US strikes on alleged drug boats have said many of the dead were civilians – primarily fishers.Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro hasrepeatedly accused Trumpof seeking to oust him.US bombers have also conductedshows of force near Venezuela, flying over the Caribbean Sea off the country’s coast on at least four occasions since mid-October.Maduro – who has been indicted on drug charges in the United States – insists there is no drug cultivation in his country, which he says is used as a trafficking route for Colombian cocaine against its will.The Trump administration has said in a notice to Congress that the United States is engaged in “armed conflict” with Latin American drug cartels, describing them as terrorist groups as part of its justification for the strikes.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUS militaryCaribbeanVenezuelaAmericasUS politicsPete HegsethTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Susan Collins and Thom Tillis, who had expressed reservations about the strikes, voted against.In recent weeks, the Trump administration has ramped up its military campaign against drug cartels – and to destabilize the Venezuelan government – deploying the United States’most advanced aircraft carrierto the Caribbean, just days after Trump announced the US would next hit land-based targets.“I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” Trump told reporters at the White House on 23 October. “We’re going to kill them, you know. They’re going to be, like, dead.”The administration has also developed a range of options for military action inVenezuela, according to two people familiar with the matter, and Trump’s aides have asked the justice department for additional guidance that could provide a legal basis to strike targets other than boats.Trump has yet to make a decision, in part because the office of legal counsel at the justice department has not yet issued an updated memo. Trump is also uncertain about the most aggressive plan to try to oust the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, from power, the Wall Street Journal reported.The war powers resolution had virtually no chance of being enacted, given it would need to be signed by Trump himself, but the vote on the resolution gave an opportunity for senators to go on the record with their concerns about the escalatingUS militaryentanglements in the region.“Iftheadministration intends to escalate towards conflict with Venezuela, Congress has a constitutional duty to declare and authorize such action,” Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, said before the vote. “We cannot sleepwalk into another war.“If this operation makes strategic sense, let the administration make that case to Congress and the American people,” Reed added. “What happens when we win? What does winning mean? What are the limits of this operation?”The continued strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats and the prospect of strikes on land in Venezuela have led to growing frustration among lawmakers, including Republicans on key committees who have sought more detailed legal justifications.At a classified briefing on Wednesday by the defense secretary,Pete Hegseth, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, top congressional leaders were told the administration was continuing to rely on an office of legal counsel memo that listed dozens of drug cartel groups as legitimate targets for lethal strikes.The administration also sent T Elliot Gaiser, the head of the justice department’s office of legal counsel, according to people familiar with the matter. Gaiser previously told lawmakers the strikes did not rise to the level of “hostilities” covered by the 1973 law called the War Powers Resolution, which limits the president’s ability to conduct unilateral military operations.Trump announced what appears to have been thefirst strikeon 2 September, releasing a brief video of the attack. In the weeks that followed, the administration announced more strikes without disclosing details other than the number of people killed and the claim that the boats carried drugs.Since the start of the military campaign, the administration has provided a dubious legal justification for the strikes, claiming the boats are affiliated with “designated terrorist organizations”, or DTOs, with which the US was now in a “non-international armed conflict”, the Guardianhas reported.The administration has nevertheless provided no concrete evidence to date that those killed in the boat strikes were smuggling drugs to the US. In briefings to Congress, Pentagon officials in essence said the boats were legitimate targets because Trump had designated them as assets of cartels seen to be DTOs, people familiar with the matter said.The military campaign has also drawn in the Central Intelligence Agency. Trump confirmed on 15 October that he hadauthorized so-called “covert action”by the CIA in Venezuela. The Guardian has reported that the CIA has been providing a bulk of the intelligence used in the airstrikes.Explore more on these topicsUS SenateDonald TrumpUS politicsVenezuelaPete HegsethTrump administrationAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities later said the suspect was a 17-year-old male student who had been injured and was undergoing surgery.Witnesses told local television stations that they heard at least two loud blasts at about midday, just as the sermon had started, from inside and outside the mosque at SMA 72, a state high school within a navy compound in Jakarta’s northern Kelapa Gading neighbourhood.Students and others ran out in panic as grey smoke filled the mosque.Police said they had recovered a toy submachine gun belonging to the suspect and inscribed with what appeared to be white supremacist slogans.The deputy house speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad told reporters after visiting victims at a hospital that the suspect was a “17-year-old male student’” and that he was undergoing surgery. He gave no more details.The chief of national police, Listyo Sigit Prabowo, said the suspect was one of two students having surgery for injuries from the blasts.“Our personnel are currently conducting an in-depth investigation to determine the suspect’s identity and the environment where he lives, including his house and others,” Sigit told a news conference at the presidential palace in Jakarta.Sigit said investigators were still collecting information to determine a motive, including how the suspect was able to assemble a toy submachine gun inscribed with a white supremacist slogan that was a reference to the2019 mass shooting at a mosque and Islamic centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 51 people were killed and dozens more injured.“We discovered the weapon was a toy gun with specific markings, which we are also investigating to understand the motive, including how he assembled it and carried out the attack,” Sigit said.Most of the victims suffered burns and injuries from flying glass. The type of explosive used was not immediately known but the blasts came from near the mosque’s loudspeaker, according to the Jakarta police chief, Asep Edi Suheri.He warned against speculation that the incident was a terrorist attack before the police investigation was completed.Police confirmed they were looking into reports in local media that the suspect was a grade 12 student who had been bullied and wanted revenge by carrying out what was intended to be a suicide attack.“We are still investigating the possibility that bullying was a factor that motivated the suspect to carry out the attack,” the Jakarta police spokesperson Budi Hermanto told reporters late on Friday.“There are several obstacles in obtaining information from witnesses as they are also victims who need medical treatment to recover,” Hermanto said, adding that authorities were providing “trauma healing” for students and teachers.He revised the number of people injured to 54, instead of 55 as police had said earlier, saying most of the victims were standing close to the loudspeaker and suffered hearing loss from the blasts inside the mosque. About 33 students remained in two hospitals with burns and wounds from blast fragments.Hermanto said the capital was safe and security was under control, and he urged people not to be anxious.Videos circulating on social media showed dozens of students in uniform running in panic across the school’s basketball court, some covering their ears with their hands, apparently to protect themselves from the blasts.Some of the injured were carried on stretchers to waiting cars.Shocked relatives gathered at centres set up at Yarsi and Cempaka Putih hospitals to seek information about their loved ones. Parents told television stations their children had wounds from being hit in the head, feet and hands by shrapnel.Explore more on these topicsIndonesiaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

On its release in 1994 it became New Zealand’s highest grossing film and went on to make an international impact. As a result, Tamahori was hired to make period noir Mulholland Falls, starring Nick Nolte and Chazz Palminteri, to moderate acclaim and box office.However, Tamahori was now considered a reliable Hollywood operator, making the survival thriller The Edge, featuringAnthony Hopkinsopposite Bart the bear in a script by David Mamet, and Along Came a Spider, a James Patterson thriller starring Morgan Freeman.He then took on his most high-profile job, the Bond film Die Another Day, which would become famous for its invisible car and Halle Berry’s orange bikini. It would also prove to be Pierce Brosnan’s last outing as 007, before the reins were handed over to Daniel Craig.As Tamahori himself noted, the advent of the Bourne franchise ended up making the Brosnan era look a little old-fashioned, but the film proved a hit with audiences on its release in 2002, if not necessarily with critics.View image in fullscreenTemuera Morrison in Mahana (The Patriarch).Photograph: BERLINALE/EPAAfter Bond, Tamahori went on to another putative blockbuster sequel, XXX: State of the Union starring Ice Cube, after the original’s star Vin Diesel dropped out. He then made Nic Cage sci-fi thriller Next and political fable The Devil’s Double, about Saddam Hussein’s son Uday and his body double, both played by Dominic Cooper.Tamahori subsequently returned to New Zealand to make Mahana, based on Witi Ihimaera’s novel Bulibasha: King of the Gypsies, about a fictional Māori patriarch, in which he cast his Once Were Warriors lead actor Temuera Morrison.Saying it was shot as a “western, specifically a 1950s American western”, Tamahori was phlegmatic at its failure at the box office in its home country. “It’s a period film about a bygone era and it deals with the older generation, so young people didn’t go and see it.”In 2024 he released The Convert, starring Guy Pearce as a British missionary who becomes involved with local Māori.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersNew ZealandDie Another DayMāoriJames BondPierce BrosnannewsShareReuse this content"

But on 5 November the festival’s curator, Zhu Rikun, posted on Facebook that he had been forced to cancel 80% of the planned screenings because film-makers had pulled out.Zhu said the requests primarily came from directors based in China, who cited “personal reasons” for changing their mind about screening their films. Directors based outside China said their families back home had been contacted by the Chinese authorities, a common way of applying pressure to people beyond its borders.View image in fullscreenThe film festival was due to launch in New York this weekend.Photograph: IndieChina Film FestivalZhu, who is based in New York, said a colleague at his studio in Beijing had been taken away for questioning by the authorities and told not to work with him.One of the festival’s venues received an anonymous letter claiming to be from a group of Chinese students living in New York who wanted the screening to be cancelled, Zhu said.On Thursday, Zhu said he had been forced to cancel the festival. “Given the current circumstances, if I do not suspend this edition of the film festival, anyone involved in the festival – whether directors, forum participants, associated staff, volunteers, or even audience members – could potentially face threats or harassment,” he said in a statement.“This situation places me in a difficult ethical position. As both an organiser and an individual, I have no intention of putting anyone in danger, whether such danger is real or fabricated as a means of intimidation.”Yalkun Uluyol, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “The Chinese government reached around the globe to shut down a film festival in New York City. This latest act of transnational repression demonstrates the Chinese government’s aim to control what the world sees and learns about China.”Zhu is a renowned film-maker who was involved in China’s once active indie film scene. But the community has been pushed underground as the country’s authorities have cracked down on cultural activities that take place outside the Chinese Communist party’s control.In 2014, China’s most prominentindependent film festivalwasshut downand the curator’s archive seized by the authorities.In January,Chen Pinlin, a documentary film-maker,was sentenced to three-and-a-half yearsin prison after releasing a documentary about the 2022 “white paper” protests.Several people associated with the festival have come under pressure from the Chinese authorities, with many choosing not to publicise their experiences for fear of generating a further backlash.Activists have said that China’s transnational repression efforts, particularly in the arts, have been ratcheting up. In August, an art gallery in Bangkok reportedlycomplied with requestsfrom the Chinese embassy to censor details of an exhibition that referenced Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, places the Chinese government deems sensitive.The Chinese embassy in Washington has been approached for comment.Additional research by Lillian YangExplore more on these topicsChinaNew YorkTransnational repressionAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing retaliated by halting all exports from Nexperia’s factories in the country, threatening todisrupt car production in Europe and Japan.The White House had put Wingtech on a list of companies that would have their exports to the US controlled under its “affiliate rule”. However, as part of the deal between Trump and Xi in South Korea, the US authorities will now delay the implementation of this rule for a year in exchange for China pausing its own restrictions on exports of chips andcrucial rare-earth minerals.The Dutch economy minister, Vincent Karremans, said on Thursday he trusted that Nexperia chips would reach customers inEuropeand the rest of the world in the coming days.Meanwhile, one of the main suppliers to the German car industry, Aumovio, confirmed on Friday it had received notice fromChinathat chips supply would resume to its operations.“We applied for and received an exemption from the export restrictions. We received it ‌the day before yesterday verbally, yesterday in writing,” Aumovio’s chief executive, Philipp von Hirschheydt, said after the company reported ⁠its third-quarter results.At the heart of the dispute is control of Nexperia’s operations in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, after the company was acquired by the partially state-owned Wingtech in 2018. Karremans took control of the chipmaker on 30 September amid fears its operations and intellectual property would be moved to China.Nexperia in the Netherlands said it was pleased by the one-year suspension of the US affiliate rule and also welcomed China’s commitment to “facilitate the resumption of exports” from the company’s Chinese facility.But it added that there continued to be some concerns and that it could not tell “if or when” products from its facility in China would be delivered.The row that threatened to halt car assembly lines in Europe underlines the global nature of car industry’s supply chain and the vulnerability of European and Japanese companies that rely on China for chips.US authorities had also raised security concerns about Wingtech and Nexperia’s Chinese chief executive, Zhang Xuezheng, in June, court documents show.Four days after the seizure, China banned exports from Nexperia’s factories in the country, where about 70% of its chips are packaged before distribution. By the end of last month, Nexperia had retaliated byhalting chip supplies to a Chinese plant.Bloomberg reports on Friday cited sources who said the Dutch government was ready to shelve the order that gave it power to block or change key corporate decisions at Nexperia on the condition that China resumed exports of critical chips.Karremans said the Netherlands had been informed by Beijing and Washington that the deal struck by Trump and Xi last month would enable the resumption of supplies from Nexperia’s facilities in China.“This is also consistent with information provided to the European Commission by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryEuropeChinaAsia PacificNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

It can also launch a wider range of aircraft than the steam system used on most US carriers.The vessel is one of the most high profile signs of Xi’s long-running efforts to overhaul and modernise the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and it joins the older Soviet designed and built Liaoning, and the Soviet-designed butChinese-built Shandong, in active service. China now has the second most carriers in the world, ahead of the UK, India and Italy – who have two each – but still far behind its key rival the US, which has 11.Compared to the ski-jump system of the Liaoning and Shandong, the Fujian’s electromagnetic launch also gives China the ability to deploy heavier aircraft, with full fuel loads, such as the KJ-600 early warning and control plane, which it successfully tested during its sea trials. State media also touted the craft’s ability to launch fighter jet sorties at faster rates.China’s navy said it launched the latest J-35 stealth fighter and J-15T heavy fighter from the Fujian, giving the new carrier “full-deck operation capability”. US military analysts have said the Fujian’s configuration does not match the US’s newer carriers as it doesn’t appear to allow for concurrent takeoffs and landings, but its electromagnetic launch system is found only on the latest US navy Ford-class carriers.View image in fullscreenThe aircraft carriers Shandong and Fujian observed by satellite last month at the Yulin naval base in China.Photograph: Planet Labs PBC/APChina’s shipbuilding operates at an unrivalled pace but is secretive, and observers scour state media alerts and satellite images for signs of the latest developments and innovations.This year the PLA has beentesting several new barge ships, designed to create a loading dock from almost a kilometre out from shore, to bypass rough seas and rocky coastlines. For several years observers have also analysed the development of dual-use “roll-on-roll-off” (roro) ferries repurposed to carry military equipment across the Taiwan Strait. There is some evidence they are already working on a fourth carrier.Having more carriers vastly expands the area in which China can patrol, with at least two in operation at any one time. The PLA advancement is particularly focused on reaching capability to invade and annex Taiwan, or at least conduct a blockade, even if the US decides to defend Taiwan. It is also focused on enforcing territorial claims anddominance in areas such as the South China Seaand East China Sea, and pursuing an overall goal of becoming a major player on the high seas, and to rival US power in the Pacific.“Carriers are key to Chinese leadership’s vision of China as a great power with a blue-water navy,” or one that can project power far from its coastal waters, said Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.View image in fullscreenThe Fujian conducts its maiden sea trial in May 2024.Photograph: Ding Ziyu/AP“A carrier doesn’t really help you in the First Island Chain, but it’s key to that contest, if you want one, with the Americans in the wider Indo-Pacific,” Poling said, referring to the run of island nations from Japan to the Philippines that sit between China and the Pacific.Raymond Kuo, director of the Rand Corporation’s “Taiwan policy initiative”, said examining the Fujian in terms of China v US was not necessarily the right way to assess its capabilities.“US carriers are much more capable, but part of the issue is we are now much more vulnerable to anti-ship missiles, so having lighter carriers with fewer personnel can be an advantage,” Kuo said.China increasing its fleet to three also “severely complicates Taiwanese defensive plans” Kuo said. Taiwan’s defensive strategies had long included plans to move its war planes from the vulnerable west coast to the east, where they were protected by a mountain range. But with China now able to cover more areas with extra strike carrier groups, even if one is out of commission, the east coast was now much more open.Earlier this year the PLA’s navy heldlive fire drills in the Tasman Seabetween Australia and New Zealand for the first time, and conducted a circumnavigation of the Australian continent, drawing concern from Australia and its allies. It has also conducted joint drills with key ally, Russia.China also debuted a raft of new technologies at its military parade in Beijing, designed to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China calls the war of resistance against Japanese aggression.Several newly developed weapons and aircraft were revealed, including hypersonic missiles designed to take out ships at sea, underwater drones, and electronic warfare planes that can fly with fighter jets to track moving targets for them while also drawing away fire. An unnamed aircraft that was eithera real or mocked up stealth drone fighteralso turned heads. Meanwhile the appearance of new submarine-launched and road mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles(ICMBs), confirmed that China now has a solid and diverse delivery system for nuclear strikes – from land, air and sea.Explore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificWater transportnewsShareReuse this content"

Legally, the document must be provided under the state’s Judicial Review Act.All four were asked by the Queensland health department for details of their child’s medical history, including “your child’s name, their date of birth and any other evidence which supports your child having a clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria”.The details were sought before the statement of reasons would be released.The email, which has been seen by the Guardian, also asked them to “please also confirm if your child is a patient of the Queensland Children’s Gender Clinic so that we can verify the information provided with Children’s Health Queensland,” reads the email, which was sent last Friday.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailAll four mothers described the request as an invasion of privacy.One parent said she was reluctant to divulge the information because the state government had accidentally sent her information to a different parent.“It feels like having to ‘out’ your child to actually get a response; like, it’s terrifying,” she said.Louise*, who cannot be legally identified because it would also identify or “out” her child, was one of several who asked for a statement of reasons both times.In May, the department emailed a response intended for her to another parent, revealing her name and address – and the fact that she had a transgender child – to a stranger. She said a department official later apologised over the phone; the Guardian has seen an email from the department confirming the error.She said she felt “sick and unsafe” as a result of the error.“My daughter is incredibly private. She is immensely fearful of being outed in any public space. She doesn’t like anyone to know that she’s trans,” Louise said.“I respect that to my core as much as humanly possible. The only time I ever, ever disclose is out of necessity for gaining access to supports and only to people I consider incredibly safe and I know well.”Louise was particularly concerned about the suggestion it would be “verified” by the hospital.She said the request was “intimidating” and “feels threatening”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You wouldn’t disclose, for example, your HIV status to the minister’s office, you know. You’d be very reluctant and very cautious to provide any of that information to a bunch of bureaucrats, basically.”The LGBTI Legal Service, which represented the mother in her challenge, was considering a second lawsuit, it said last week.Its president, Ren Shike, said the decision had affected about 500 Queensland children and their families and it was “important to efficiently facilitate the provision of reasons so that children and their parents can understand the reasoning behind this decision, which has had such a devastating impact on their access to healthcare”.The government has repeatedly said the ban would remain in place until a review into gender-affirming care had been completed.In Australia, children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact theKids Helplineon 1800 55 1800; support is also available atBeyond Blueon 1300 22 4636 andLifelineon 13 11 14.

It wants its changes to the Environment Protection and BiodiversityConservation(EPBC) Act rushed through parliament before the end of the year.But should they be?Australia’s environment is going downhill and the changes are meant to turn that trajectory around. But lawyers, experts and advocates say the legislation is full of loopholes and problems.Chris Bowen agrees with UK PM that the ‘consensus is gone’ on fighting climate changeRead moreMuch has been said about whether the government will reach a deal with the Greens or Coalition but less about the bigger question: can these bills do the job of addressing Australia’s biodiversity crisis?Here are five areas of concern.1. Excessive ministerial powerAustralia’s nature laws have been widely criticised for giving too much power to the minister of the day to decide whether or not developments go ahead and what conditions are applied to ensure threatened plants, animals and ecosystems are protected.In his 2020review of the EPBC Act, Graeme Samuel, the former chief of the competition watchdog, said the “unfettered discretion” granted to ministers to interpret the laws was a major problem that had led to poor outcomes for Australia’s environment.Experts and campaigners say there are positive elements in the new legislation. These include requirements that developments result in a “net gain” for the environment and projects with “unacceptable impacts” be refused. Projects would be assessed against new, legally binding national environmental standards.But they say this is undermined because the minister would still have significant power to interpret whether these requirements have been met, or if they even apply. That is, the legislation does not fix the problem of ministerial discretion.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA legal briefing by Environmental Justice Australia and the Environmental Defenders Office warns that if the legislation is passed in its current form it would “exacerbate” the flaws of the existing EPBC Act and lead to poor outcomes for nature by “increasing” the amount of ministerial discretion, rather than constraining it.“Unfortunately in the bills there’s a high degree of discretion retained for the minister that potentially undermines the powers the laws could have to actually protect nature,” the deputy director of policy and law reform at the EDO, Rachel Walmsley, said.This is done through subjective and weak language. For example, rather than mandating that a development only be approved if it clearly complies with national standards, it is up to the minister to decide if they are “satisfied” a project is “not inconsistent” with them.Whether or not the impacts of a development are unacceptable or a project delivers a net environmental gain is also left up to the minister’s satisfaction. The words “the Minister is satisfied” appear hundreds of times in the legislation.Concerns have also been raised abouta new exemptionthat would allow the minister to approve a project in breach of nature laws if it was in the “national interest”.Nicola Rivers, co-chief executive of EJA, said if the government was serious about halting extinctions, the level of discretion could be fixed through simple amendments.“You just have to remove those words ‘the Minister is satisfied’ for those key provisions that [otherwise] are not going to work the way they’re supposed to work,” she said.2. Climate, forestry and First Nations expertise is missingOne of the major criticisms of the legislation is what is missing from it.Under the existing laws, logging covered by a regional forest agreement between the federal and a state government is effectively exempt from federal law protecting threatened species.The Albanese government had promised to fix this by applying new national environmental standards to the agreements. But the bills before parliament retain the industry carve-out.Bob Brown: ‘Being an environmentalist is sensible. I like defying the growth mentality because it’s irrational’Read moreAnother point on which Samuel’s review was scathing was the failure by successive governments to harness the knowledge of Indigenous Australians to improve management of the environment.The scientist-ledBiodiversityCouncil says the new legislation does not meaningfully address this problem or embed Indigenous participation in decision-making. A promised standard on Indigenous engagement is also yet to be released.The environment minister, Murray Watt, has so far released just one draft standard for matters of national environmental significance, such as threatened species and world heritage areas. He has promised a second draft standard on offsets before the bills are voted on. Others are “under development” but the legislation does not specify which standards are required or under what timeframe.The failure of national environmental laws to properly consider climate change would also continue under the proposed laws. Developers would have to disclose a project’s domestic emissions. But anything substantial that would require an assessment of climate harm is “missing”, says the Australian Conservation Foundation’s Brendan Sydes.3. A problematic framework for offsetsEnvironmental offsets allow developers to compensate for the damage they cause by restoring habitat for the same species or ecosystem elsewhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe policy has been beset with problems, including that promised offsets are sometimes never delivered or are insufficient to compensate for the environmental loss caused by a development.You’re basically saying you can trade koalas with a land snail in Tasmania or a small plant in north QueenslandBrendan Wintle, Biodiversity CouncilThe legislation would establish a government “restoration contributions” fund that developers could pay into, rather than finding and securing an offset themselves.The legislation would alsooverturn a banon offsets forming part of the federal nature repair market.Experts say these proposals would introduce the sort of problems that led to major environmental and integrity failures in offset schemes at the state level, as exposed by a Guardian Australia investigation thattriggered several inquiriesin New South Wales.TheNSW auditor general founda similar state-managed fund had poor oversight and failed to adequately deliver the necessary offsets meant to help nature.The government has said its fund could deliver “landscape”-scale restoration, but experts say it would allow developers to “pay to destroy” nature with no guarantee offset obligations would be met.The proposed restoration contribution fund would also relax “like-for-like” rules that require offsets to deliver an environmental benefit for the same species or ecosystem affected by a development.Prof Brendan Wintle, lead councillor at the Biodiversity Council, said it was “absurd”. “You’re basically saying you can trade koalas with a land snail in Tasmania or a small plant in north Queensland.”4. Streamlined assessment reduces consultationThe bill abolishes three methods for assessing projects under Australia’s environmental laws and replaces them with a single streamlined process that would see projects approved within 30 days.The government wants to encourage developers to do their environmental documentation in advance to reduce assessment delays – particularly as Australia tries to speed up the rollout of renewable energy.Toxic emissions: how net zero became a ‘poisoned’ policy for the CoalitionRead moreBut Kirsty Howey, of the Environment Centre NT, said organisations on the ground were worried it reduces transparency, “guts” community consultation and has no guardrails on the size and types of projects that could be fast-tracked. Community consultation would be limited to a short period when a project is first referred to the government for a decision on whether it requires an assessment and what type.Georgina Woods, from the Lock the Gate Alliance, said the streamlining plan could lead to “quick and dirty approval of all kinds of development, including mining and fracking, with no public consultation”.5. Vague definition of unacceptable impactsOne of the government’s key reforms is to define “unacceptable impacts” to nature that would prevent developments that were too damaging.Experts have welcomed this as a positive step but fear its potential effectiveness is weakened in the legislation’s current form by vague and subjective concepts such as whether or not a development could “seriously impair the viability” of a species or ecosystem or “cause serious damage to critical habitat”.Wintle said such language lacked explicit definitions or thresholds – for example specifying how much destruction of an ecosystem or a species’ habitat would be considered unacceptable – and was again open to ministerial discretion.He said an objective set of tests that made the definition of an unacceptable impact clear would be better for the environment and for industry.“Business won’t be wasting time on things that shouldn’t get past the first hurdle,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsLabor partyClimate crisisBiodiversityConservationWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

Most obligations on companies developing high-risk AI systems that “pose serious risks to health, safety or fundamental rights” are not due to come into effect until August 2026 or a year after that.Global stock markets fall sharply over AI bubble fearsRead moreAccording to the Financial Times, the commission is considering giving a one-year “grace period” to companies breaching the rules on the highest-risk AI.Providers of generative AI – systems that can produce content, such as text or images – who have already placed products on the market before the implementation date could be granted a one-year pause from the laws “to provide sufficient time   … to adapt their practices within a reasonable time without disrupting the market”, stated an internal document cited by the FT.The commission is also considering delays to imposing fines for violations of its new AI transparency rules until August 2027 to “provide sufficient time for adaptation of providers and deployers of AI systems” to implement the obligations, the newspaper reported.Also being studied is greater flexibility for AI developers of high-risk systems over monitoring performance of products on the market, by allowing them to follow guidance that would be less prescriptive than the system originally envisaged, according to the specialist news site MLex, whichfirst reported on the planned amendmentsto the act.The proposals could change before their expected release on 19 November. Once published, they would then have to be agreed by EU member states and the European parliament.The EU has come under repeated pressure from the Trump administration to weaken regulation of tech companies. The US presidentrecently threatened to impose tariffson countries with tech regulations or digital taxes that he deemed to be “designed to harm or discriminate against American technology”.Meta announced this year that itwould not be signing the commission’s code of practice for general-purpose AI models.“Europe is heading down the wrong path on AI,” wrote the company’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, who contended that the code introduced “legal uncertainties” for model developers, as well as measures that went “far beyond the scope of the AI Act”.But it is not just US companies that have complained about Europe’s regulation of the fast-evolving technology.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The idea forms the centrepiece of the “democracy shield” pitched by the commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, when she sought a second term before the 2024 European elections.Von der Leyenannounced the ideaof a European Centre for Democratic Resilience ina speechto MEPs in September. The document, due to be released on 12 November, sketches out further details, including where the commission sees its biggest threat. “In addition to its brutal war of aggression against Ukraine,Russia is also escalating hybrid attacks, waging a battle of influence against Europe,” states the draft seen by the Guardian. “By spreading deceitful narratives, sometimes including the manipulation and falsification of historical facts, they try to erode trust in democratic systems.”The EU’s foreign service says it has identified dozens of instances of Russian disinformation and information manipulation, such as theDoppelganger campaign in the run-up to the European elections, where copycat versions of well-known media sites promulgated anti-western narratives.Disinformation was carried on websites mimicking media outlets such as Die Welt, Le Point, La Stampa and Polskie Radio as part of the campaign, believed to have been active since 2022. On these copycat sites, fake articles, which were also widely promoted on social media, sought to discredit politicians, as well as undermine government support for Ukrainian refugees or Ukraine.China has also been identified as a disinformation threat and is alleged to use private PR companies and influencers “to create, amplify and launder content aligned with China’s political interests worldwide”,according to the EU’s diplomatic service.

Italy has more than double the number of centenarians than it had in 2009, Istat said.Of those reaching the milestone age this year, 82.6% are women. Women also take the lead among Italy’s 724 semi-supercentenarians – people aged 105 and over – and among the 19 supercentenarians, those in the 110-plus age bracket.Lucia Laura Sangenito, who lives in the southern Campania region, will celebrate her 115th birthday on 22 November, making her Italy’s oldest woman and the third oldest inEurope, after Ethel Caterham, 116, in the UK and Marie-Rose Tessier, a French woman who turned 115 in May.Emma Morano, from the northern Piedmont region, held the title of the world’s oldest person for 11 months until her death in 2017 at the age of 117. Vitantonio Lovallo, Italy’s oldest man, marked his 111th birthday on Friday.The centenarian population is rapidly growing across EU countries, with the number of people in the bloc aged 100 or moreforecast to reachalmost half a million by 2050, up from 96,600 in 2019.France, Italy and Greece have the highest ratio of centenarians per capita. In the UK, the number of people aged 100 and over doubled from 8,300 in 2004 to 16,600 in 2024,according to figuresreleased in October.In Italy, the southern region of Molise tops the list of centenarians in relative terms, followed by the Aosta Valley and Liguria, Istat said.Sardinia also boasts a high concentration of centenarians, leading to a cluster of villages on the island being identified in 2004 among the world’s seven so-called “blue zones”, where a significant share of the population live exceptionally long lives.Perdasdefogu, atown tucked high up in the rugged mountainsof south-eastern Sardinia accessible only by a narrow, winding road, has twice entered the Guinness World Records book for its centenarians. The first occasion was in 2012, when the nine siblings that made up the Melis family racked up a combined age of 818. In 2021, the town achieved a second record for having the largest concentration of centenarians in the world, with eight people aged 100 and over in a population of 1,778.The Mediterranean diet has long been thought to be the main ingredient for longevity among Italians, combined with strong social connections and a healthcare system that is generally considered to be good.‘I’m always working’: Italy’s centenarian barista on her longevityRead moreItalian centenarians also tend to be sprightly. Anna Possi, who will be 101 on 16 November, still works in her bar in a town overlooking Lake Maggiore, making her Italy’s oldest barista. She told the Guardian in an interview last year that she will “keep going so long as my health permits”.In 2022, Candida Uderzo had herdriving licence renewed at the age of 100. She’s among at least four centenarians in recent years to have been deemed fit to get behind the wheel, including Luciano Gulmini, who had his permit renewed in 2024 soon after turning 100.While Italy’s centenarians are hugely celebrated, the ageing population is causing problems for the government, especially as it coincides with a plummeting birthrate, placing pressure on the pension and healthcare systems. In 2024, just 370,000 new births were recorded, the lowest figure since Italy’s unification in 1861.Explore more on these topicsItalyAgeingEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It describes itself as a “strategic advisory firm” that advises chief executives and political leaders to manage “high-stakes issues”.Working with at least one other firm, Highgate sought to establish connections between the woman andIsrael. However, documents seen by the Guardian suggest no such evidence was found.People familiar with the activities of the private intelligence firms said its operation was commissioned by a high-level diplomatic unit within the Qatari state.Khan’s alleged victim told the Guardian she was appalled by the “disturbing” operation. “The idea that private intelligence firms have been instructed to target me is as incomprehensible as it is heartbreaking.”In a statement to the Guardian, Highgate confirmed it had worked on an operation related to the ICC but said it had not “acted against any individual”. It denied the project was paid or commissioned by the “government of Qatar”.Details about a Qatari unit’s apparent involvement in the spy operation – which also appears to have targeted other ICC officials – is the latest twist in the saga relating to the prosecutor that has thrown the court into an unprecedented crisis.Khan’s decision to seek warrants for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant for alleged crimes in Gaza has made him and the court a target for the US and Israel.The abuse allegations have further complicated his tenure as prosecutor. He hasstepped aside pending a UN inquiryinto his conduct.The Guardian has seen no evidence that Khan had any personal involvement in the operation. However, people familiar with the operation said Highgate met Khan’s representatives, raising questions about the purpose of the meeting.Year of turmoilKhan’s term as ICC prosecutor was thrown into turmoil late last year when the abuse allegations made by the court stafferbecame public. The woman, a lawyer in her 30s, worked directly for him.Her claims include allegations of coercive sexual behaviour and abuse of authority. The alleged sexual misconduct is said to have occurred in hotel rooms during work trips, in Khan’s office at the ICC, and at his home.A UN watchdog is investigating her claims. In August,the Guardian reportedthat a second woman had come forward to the inquiry with allegations that Khan mistreated her while working for him as an unpaid intern earlier in his career.Khan’s lawyers have repeatedly said he “categorically denies” having mistreated any individual and claimed the prosecutor “has been the subject of an orchestrated campaign” to discredit him.While the Guardian understands there have been attempts by pro-Israeli actors to leak information about the ICC staffer’s complaint, it has found no evidence to suggest the women have raised the allegations as part of a plot against the prosecutor.Quick GuideHow to contact our investigations teamShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact our investigations team confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The funding was regarded as highly sensitive. Executives involved in the project were careful to refer to its client as the “client country” or “Q country”.A document seen by the Guardian suggests that at one stage during the operation Highgate sought information that would link the alleged victim and her family members with Israel or its intelligence agencies.Highgate engaged a specialist firm, Elicius Intelligence, to assist with its information gathering about the woman, her child, her husband and his parents. Highgate also asked the company to investigate other ICC officials who had been involved in the court’s response to the allegations.Documents suggest that Elicius produced several reports for Highgate that included “sensitive” information about their private lives, former relationships, and financial situations. At one point, according to the files, Highgate asked for the birth certificate of the woman’s young child to be obtained.Highgate also obtained the woman’s passport details and sought detailed information about flights she had taken in recent years. The reports contain passwords used by the woman for online accounts, including a private email address, that appear to have come from hacked data available on the dark web.In its statement, Highgate said the claim it sought information about the woman’s child was “inaccurate” and suggested descriptions of other types of information obtained by the private firms were incorrect.“Highgate led an independent assessment into potential covert or improper activities that may have sought to undermine the credibility, independence, or efficiency of the ICC,” it said. “The review has considered several incidents involving multiple individuals over an extended period.”Highgate did not deny meeting Khan’s representatives, describing such information as “private, commercially sensitive and confidential”.In a statement to the Guardian, Khan’s lawyers did not dispute such a meeting took place.However, they said his representatives had “no knowledge of, let alone involvement in, the alleged activities” of the private intelligence firms. Khan’s lawyers added that he had not been provided with any “information” about its activities.Elicius Intelligence declined to comment. The government of Qatar did not initially respond to a request for comment.Following publication of this article,Qatar’s international office released a statementthat did not respond directly to the allegations, but dismissed “unfounded allegations concerning a case involving the prosecutor” of the ICC.It said falsified information and disinformation had been circulated by unspecified “bad actors”.Khan’s alleged victim, who has been waiting for almost a year for the UN inquiry to reach its conclusions, and has found herself at the centre of a major geopolitical fallout at the ICC, expressed frustration at the situation.“Where does this end and how much will be allowed? If this is what international justice looks like, it is not the system that I have dedicated my life to serving.”She added: “I have always done my work quietly and under the radar. I came to serve, not to be seen.”Additional reporting byRobert FlummerfeltThis article was updated on 7 November 2025 to include a response from the government of Qatar sent to the Guardian after publication.Explore more on these topicsInternational criminal courtInternational criminal justiceQatarIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But in her small town of Rohtak, in the north Indian state of Haryana, cricket was not a game for girls. Aged nine, desperate to play, she cut her hair short, entered a tournament disguised as her brother, and went on to win man of the match.Verma’s determined father, Sanjeev, in the face of refusal from every cricket academy or training centre who would not accept his daughter, enrolled her as a boy. “Luckily, nobody noticed,” herecalled, as Verma made her debut for the national women’s team at 15 years old.On Sunday, Verma stood triumphantly with her teammates as they held aloft theWomen’s Cricket World Cup, making history as the first Indian women’s national team to win the cup – and for equality. The struggles and sacrifices made for years by the women to get here – defying social stigma, a lack of resources and juggling manual jobs between training – made their win even more extraordinary.View image in fullscreenShafali Verma played her first cricket tournament disguised as her brother.Photograph: Unnati Naidu/SPP/ShutterstockIt came at a critical turning point for women’s cricket in India, where the sport verges on a national religion, is a multibillion dollar industry but also widely regarded as a “gentleman’s game”. It was only in 2017 that female cricketers were given full-time professional contracts and a women’s premier league (WPL) established in 2023.Varnika Choudhary, who plays for the Uttar Pradesh state under-23s women’s team, described how her small village of Beerakheri had always been very resistant to her playing cricket and it had taken two years to convince her parents to let her play. Even as the cricket-crazy village regularly gathered to watch the Indian premier league (IPL) and Men’sCricketWorld Cup, women’s professional cricket was widely ignored.But this time, said Choudhary, the whole village sat in the square to watch the Women’s World Cup final on Sunday. “Everyone in my village got so excited when they won,” she said. “They were all sending me photos and reels and messages saying: ‘This will be you winning for India one day.’”Many in her village had been particularly impressed by Verma’s batting. “They told me, wow she’s hitting like a man,” said Choudhary. “I had to correct them and say, no she’s hitting like a woman.”Hundreds of millions of people across India tuned in to watch the final and Choudhary was among the many who saw the win as a pivotal moment, not just for women’s cricket but for women in India more broadly, and their battle for equality in the country’s still deeply patriarchal society. Though more women in India are being educated, they endure heavy societal burdens on how they are expected to behave and present themselves in public and are uniformly lower paid across all sectors.“More women playing cricket changes everything, not just in the sport,” Choudhary said. “We feel independent, we feel we are doing something for ourselves and that society can finally see us equal to the men.”View image in fullscreenThe winners of this year’s Women’s Cricket World Cup   celebrate after the match.Photograph: Unnati Naidu/SPP/ShutterstockSharda Ugra, one of India’s foremost cricket writers, said the significance of the match went beyond cricket. “For Indian women in the public space, your body is usually seen as a source of honour or shame,” she said. “So to see these girls – who mostly come from rural small towns – running around, sweaty, shouting, screaming and uninhibited about what they looked like, sent a very powerful message. It was quite wonderful to see.”The national team, led by the captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, have become Indian sporting royaltyafter their win, and this week were hosted at the residence of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The significance of their triumph for women in India was widely acknowledged by the team, who paid tribute to the female cricketers who had paved the way before them. Without this trophy, said Kaur after the match, “the revolution, the change we want, won’t come”.Ugra said she believed the win would trigger “a mass movement towards making cricket a sport that girls play for leisure, for enjoyment, as a profession”, but emphasised that women’s cricket still had a long way to go in India to catch up with the IPL, a franchise valued at about $18.5bn (£14bn).There are only five teams in the WPL and the resources and cricket academies available for young women are still limited, especially in rural regions. Women’s cricket in India also does not have its own governing body, falling instead under the men’s.View image in fullscreenIndia’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, meets the women’s cricket team in New Delhi after their win.Photograph: EPAAt a cricket academy in Delhi’s Gargi college, the impact of the win was already being felt. Standing on the pitch in her cricket whites with her hands on her hips, 11-year-old Kiera Kareer said she was more motivated than ever to play for the national team one day. “This winning match proved to everybody that women’s cricket is as good as men’s, they played very smoothly,” she said. “We can hit as hard and we can run as fast. In fact, I think they played better than the men.”A few years ago, Spreeha Maurya, now 18, was the only girl attending this academy and had spent years playing with boys. The coaches, so determined to get girls into the sport, had initially let Maurya play for free.“It was so inspiring and motivating to watch the final, and see the stadium completely packed and everyone screaming and cheering when they won. I had never seen people react to women’s cricket like that before,” said Maurya.India’s World Cup win can set a new world order in women’s cricket – if it spends money wisely | Raf NicholsonRead more“I think winning this World Cup has solidified it in our mind that women can do everything and it’s not a gentleman’s game any more.”Standing on the sidelines, her father, Rudal Maurya, 54, said when he had first brought his daughter to state trials, there had only been about 40 girls – this year there were about 500 who attended. Looking around at the field, where girls as young as six stood in the batting nets, his eyes welled up.“The mindset is changing, so many more parents will bring their girls for training now, and that can change the society,” he said. “My daughter is so passionate about cricket. It is the dream of our whole family that one day, she too will play for India.”Additional reporting by Aakash HassanExplore more on these topicsIndiaWomen's Cricket World CupWomen's cricketWomenCricketSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maskell, the York Central MP, and Duncan-Jordan, who represents Poole, had spearheaded opposition to the cut to the winter fuel allowance and welfare reforms.Hinchliff, the MP for North East Hertfordshire, organised a rebellion over the government’s flagship planning bill, voicing concerns about its effect on nature. Of the suspended MPs, all but Maskell are from the 2024Labourintake.At the same time, party whips removed trade envoy roles from three other MPs who rebelled – Rosena Allin-Khan, Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Mohammad Yasin.In response to having the whip restored, Hinchliff said: “I’m pleased to have returned to the parliamentary Labour party and welcome the constructive discussions I’ve had with the new chief whip in recent months.“As ever, my focus remains on serving the communities of North East Hertfordshire and contributing to Labour’s historic mission to create a society that puts people and nature before profit.”Duncan-Jordan told the PA news agency: “I’ve been part of the Labour and trade union movement for 40 years, so I’m pleased to have had the Labour whip restored today.“I’ll continue working hard for my constituents in Poole and standing up for Labour values – tackling poverty, raising living standards and building a fairer society.”Maskell said she was “Labour to the core and will always stand up for Labour values”, after having the party whip restored.The MP told the PA news agency: “I will continue to work hard for my constituents in York as their Labour and Co-operative MP.”In 2024, shortly after the general election, seven other Labour MPs lost the whip for supporting an amendment to the king’s speech calling for an end to the two-child benefit cap, which has been blamed for a rise in child poverty.Four of these, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Ian Byrne, Imran Hussain and Richard Burgon,had the whip restored in January and February. Two others, John McDonnell and Apsana Begum,had it reinstatedin September.The last of the seven, Zarah Sultana, has cut ties with Labour and is attempting to launch a new leftwing party alongside Jeremy Corbyn, who was re-elected in 2024 election as an independent.Sultana is among a handful of other MPs elected last year on the Labour ticket who are still sitting as independents, including Diane Abbott.In July this year, in a separate case to that of the four other MPs, Abbott wassuspended for a second timeafter saying she did not regret her past remarks on racism, which had cost her the whip for a long period in the last parliament.Abbott had said people of colour experienced racism “all their lives”, which was different from the “prejudice” experienced by Jewish people, Irish people and Travellers. She was re-suspended for telling the BBC that her comments “were factually correct, as any fair-minded person would accept”.The other former Labour MPs sitting still as independents are Rosie Duffield,who resignedfrom the parliamentary party a few months after the election; Andrew Gwynne, whowas sackedas a minister and lost the whip after the emergence of offensive messages in a WhatsApp group he was part of; and Dan Norris, whowas suspendedafter he was arrested on suspicion of rape and child sex offences.Explore more on these topicsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

He was arrested in Finsbury Park, north London, on Friday after police said they had received a call from a member of the public.The erroneousrelease, and that of another prisoner who was mistakenly freed, has led tomounting political pressure on David Lammy, the justice secretary, days after he introduced stringent checks for jails.The Guardian view on mistaken prisoner releases: a broken system not human error | EditorialRead moreLammy had refused several times to say whether any more prisoners had been released in error in a bruising session of prime minister’s questions (PMQs) on Wednesday, having been ambushed with a string of questions.The moment that Kaddour-Cherif was detained appears to have beencaptured by a Sky News camera crewin Finsbury Park at 11.30am, where a man initially claimed to be someone else.Police officers then approached him and put him into the back of a police van after telling him he was under arrest “on suspicion of being wanted after being falsely released from prison”.When he initially denied being Kaddour-Cherif, the arresting officer told him he “looked exactly” like him and had a “very distinctive wonky nose”.View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy said the Labour government had inherited a prison system in crisis.Photograph: Jacob King/PAPolice brought him to the back of the van and held up an image of Kaddour-Cherif next to his face before uncuffing and recuffing his hands behind his back. Officers searched his backpack and found a laptop, umbrella and wallet.Before he was put in the back of a police van, Kaddour-Cherif turned to those gathered and said: “Look at the justice of the UK, they release people by mistake, after this they ‘ah ah ah’ … it’s not my fucking fault.”A homeless man who stays in the Finsbury Park area claimed he had called the police after recognising Kaddour-Cherif from a newspaper photograph.“I am proud Algerian. I am proud British. We do the right thing,” Nadjib Mekdhia, 50, told the PA news agency.TheMetropolitan police, which had launched a manhunt for Kaddour-Cherif, had expressed frustration that he had had a “six-day head start” because the mistaken release was only reported to the Met a week later, on 4 November.Kaddour-Cherif was identified as an overstayer five years ago, but had not been removed from the UK. When he was mistakenly freed from prison, he had been serving a sentence for trespass with intent to steal.He was convicted for indecent exposure in November 2024, when he was given an 18-month community order and placed on the sex offender register for five years.It is understood Kaddour-Cherif has not applied for asylum and was in the initial stages of being deported for overstaying his visa when he was let out.He entered the UK on a visitor visa in 2019, but was flagged as an automatic case of having overstayed on 6 February 2020.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My thanks are with the police and staff at HMPPS [HM Prison and Probation Service] who have been working around the clock.0:54Moment mistakenly released prisoner Billy Smith hands himself in – video“We inherited a prison system in crisis and I’m appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing.”However, the Conservatives made calls on Friday night for the prisoner to be deported “as soon as his sentence is finished”.Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “This case sums up the total collapse of law and order under ‘Calamity Lammy’. A foreign sex offender, meant to be deported, strolling the streets of London because Labour can’t even keep track of its prisoners.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “The vast majority of offenders released by mistake are quickly brought back to prison, and we will do everything we can to work with the police to capture the few still in the community.“These cases only further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited. This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.”The other prisoner who was mistakenly released, a fraudster, handed himself back in on Thursday. While Lammy insisted the government would clamp down on clerical errors, William Smith was filmed waving to cameras and hugging his partner before he walked back into HMP Wandsworth, in south-westLondon.Smith, 35, usually known as Billy, had been sentenced to 45 months for multiple fraud offences at Croydon crown court on Monday, but was then released in error by the prison.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationMetropolitan policePoliceLondonEnglandDavid LammyUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Enter: the cocktail T-shirt.Made of wool rather than cotton, it typically features a roomy rather than a clingy cut and sleeves that hit just above the elbow. Sometimes it comes with glistening embellishment around the neckline or it is plain, giving the wearer the option to add their own level of glitz with a sparkly necklace or brooch.“They have that sort of understated look that a T-shirt tends to give the wearer, but unlike the way a cotton T-shirt sort of unravels by midday, the knit has a more polished effect,” says Buffy Reid, the founder of the British knitwear brand &Daughter. She describes the item as having “the same ease as a T-shirt but the elegance of a knit”.View image in fullscreenA slouchy cashmere T-shirt from &Daughter.Photograph: Patrick Houi/&DaughterThe cocktail T-shirt is an emerging category in evening knitwear. As a natural fibre, wool has thermodynamic properties, meaning it will keep you warm in cool weather and cool in hot conditions – a quality ideal for the festive season where one person’s central heating level is another person’s sauna.&Daughter’s evening knitwear offerings include a slouchy cashmere T-shirt made from cashmere spun in Hawick in Scotland that comes in eight colours, including – aholiday ready red,and a bestsellingpickle greenlambswool iteration with slightly voluminous sleeves.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She consistently wears a simple cashmere jumper with the sleeves pushed up and a gem-set necklace for her post-show bow.This season she and her co-designer, Raf Simons, toyed with the idea of femininity and beauty on the catwalk, declaring it “is not a time for decadence” as they unveiled knitted T-shirts featuring chains and pearls dangling from the neckline, worthy of Mrs Prada’s own wardrobe.View image in fullscreenA cashmere T-shirt from John Lewis.Photograph: John LewisWhile the Prada T-shirts sell forfour figures, the high street has been quick to emulate the look, albeit using synthetic fibres or blended mixes rather than pure wool. This means they won’t biodegrade and as a non-breathable fabric could contribute to sweating. There are also concerns that high demand for cheap cashmere iscontributing to desertificationin countries including Mongolia, where the goats are farmed.Queralt Ferrer, John Lewis’s fashion director, says the elevated T-shirt trend is being driven by customers looking for value for money and versatility. Its £80 cashmere T-shirt, which can be worn to the office or to a fancy dinner, has become a bestseller.Naomi Pike, a commissioning editor at Elle UK, is a fan of the cocktail T-shirt and says it can also help reduce overconsumption. “I like to get good use out of all of my wardrobe and these help that happen when it comes to rotating skirts and not wasting precious pennies on one-hit party wears.”Pike says the cocktail T-shirt also appeals as it offers an alternative to the flesh-exposing tops typically marketed to shoppers each party season.“Cashmere, with its soft knit and stretch, fits me and my proportions better as I often find I’m in between sizes in T-shirts as my bust is big, waist small and shoulders narrow. Cashmere stretches better to accommodate these proportions that fashion often punishes,” Pike says.Explore more on these topicsFashionWomenRetail industryPradaJohn LewisnewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC’s board is compiling its response.However, insiders believe the leaking of the memo to the Daily Telegraph and the criticisms that have followed from Johnson are part of a concerted attempt to undermine the organisation, which is heading into crucial talks with the government over the renewal of its charter.Johnson told the Telegraph that Davie “must either explain or resign” over the claims in the memo. He said the BBC had been “caught red-handed in multiple acts of leftwing bias”.Concerns have previously been raised about the role of Robbie Gibb, who joined the BBC board when Johnson was in Downing Street.Gibb wasTheresa May’s communications directorduring her tenure as prime minister and helped launch the rightwing news channel GB News.Sources have told the Guardian that Gibb was instrumental in the appointment of Prescott as an adviser to the EGSC. They have previously been reportedas being friends. Prescott left his BBC advisory role in the summer.Johnson said the idea there was an effort to undermine the BBC’s leadership was “complete and utter bollocks”.“I haven’t spoken to either individual [Gibb or Prescott] – or been in contact with either of them in any way – for many years,” he said.“The first I heard of Michael Prescott’s report was when I saw it on the Telegraph website. The Panorama fabrication is scandalous. Why don’t you try to establish how and why that happened rather than making up more mad lefty nonsense?”Gibb was approached for comment, but referred the Guardian to the BBC. A BBC spokesperson said: “The BBC board is made up of 13 members, five of whom are appointed by government including Sir Robbie Gibb.“The editorial guidelines and standards committee is not involved in day-to-day output. It looks at editorial matters post-broadcast, including complaints.“[The editorial adviser roles] were advertised externally as part of the BBC’s open and fair competition process, and Michael Prescott was interviewed by a panel of board members who made the collective decision to appoint him.”Gibb was on the four-person panel that interviewed Prescott for the role.Prescott was also contacted for comment.In his memo, reported by the Telegraph, Prescott states: “I have never been a member of any political party and do not hold any hard and fast views on matters such as American politics or disputes in the Middle East. My views on the BBC’s treatment of the subjects covered below do not come with any political agenda.”Prescott is now preparing to appear before the Commons culture, media and sport committee soon.Rupa Huq, one of the MPs on the committee, said this kind of appearance was not normal. She tweeted that it was“highly unusual for one person panels, particularly when they are partisan figures”.A lot will now rest on the response of the BBC’s board, of which Gibb is also a member. There are some concerns among people close to the BBC that the board was set up to boost the BBC’s commercial activities, rather than to be expert on editorial issues.Some figures concerned about the criticisms of the BBC believe they are linked to attempts, dating back to Johnson’s time in charge, to pull the media to the right.Prescott’s memo has already led to criticism from senior Conservatives. The Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, said “heads should roll” at the corporation. Johnson posted on social media last week: “Is anyone at the BBC going to take responsibility – and resign?”The main criticism of Prescott’s memo focused on an edition of Panorama, broadcast a week before the US election. He accused the BBC of selectively editing a Donald Trump speech tomake it appear clearer that he encouraged the US Capitol attack.A spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.” The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.Prescott also raised concerns about BBC Arabic. He claimed that a review by the BBC journalist David Grossman had highlighted “systemic problems within BBC Arabic” that represented anti-Israel bias. He added that insufficient action had been taken after Grossman’s report.This is disputed. Minutes ofa meeting of the EGSC in March, in which the findings of Grossman’s report were discussed, state that “important structural and management changes had recently been made to the oversight of World Service operations, including BBC Arabic. In response to the report a number of additional actions had been implemented.”A BBC spokesperson said: “With regard to BBC News Arabic, where mistakes have been made or errors have occurred, we have acknowledged them at the time and taken action.“We have also previously acknowledged that certain contributors should not have been used and have improved our processes to avoid a repeat of this.”The BBC said it had already stopped featuring figures cited by Prescott as expressing antisemitic views.In 2021, the Johnson government was accused of creating a conflict of interest afterappointing Prescottto help select the next chair of Ofcom, the UK’s media regulator. He was appointed as a senior external interviewer for the role. The Johnson government had been pushing for the Ofcom job to go to Paul Dacre, the former editor of the Daily Mail.The Tube presenter, the former ballerina and the banker: the BBC board’s membersRead moreAt the time, a government spokesperson responded on Prescott’s behalf to say: “The recruitment process for the Ofcom chair is fair and open and there are no conflicts of interest. Mr Prescott’s role on the panel has been approved by the independent commissioner for public appointments.”Gibb has previously been accused of attempting toblock a senior editorial appointmenton political grounds. He was accused of trying to stop Jess Brammar, the former editor ofHuffPostUK and deputy editor of BBC Newsnight, from a role overseeing the BBC’s news channels.A BBC spokesperson said at the time that “as a general principle, board members are able to discuss issues with other board members or senior executives. These principles were adhered to”.Explore more on these topicsBoris JohnsonBBCnewsShareReuse this content"

We need to take down the ‘for sale’ sign on Mother Earth and bar entry to Cop for oil and gas lobbyists,” said Brenna Yellowthunder, lead coordinator for the Indigenous Environmental Network, a member of KBPO.The 30th UN climate summit (Cop30) opens on Monday in Belém, a city in the Brazilian Amazon – the world’s largest rainforest, which is being destroyed by ever-expanding fossil fuel exploitation, industrial agriculture and mining, among other extractive industries.The annual meetings are where every country in the world negotiates on how best to tackle the climate crisis. The decisions should be driven by the legally binding United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) treaty, and the 2015 Paris agreement to curtail global heating to under 1.5C.The research analyses the fossil fuel lobbyists known to have attended the negotiations in Glasgow (Cop26), Sharm el-Sheikh (Cop27), Dubai (Cop28) and Baku (Cop29). Until then, information about lobbyists was not collated by the UNFCCC.Growing anger at the lack of meaningful action by the world’s wealthiest, most polluting countries has been compounded by revelations that the fossil fuel industry appears to be granted greater access to the climate talks than most countries.Last year, 1,773 registered fossil fuel lobbyists attended the summit in Azerbaijan – 70% more than the total number of delegates from the 10 mostclimate-vulnerable nationscombined (1,033).But the true reach of fossil fuel tentacles is undoubtedly deeper as the lobbyists data excludes executives and other company representatives on official country delegations participating directly in the confidential negotiations, and those attending as guests of governments, known as overflow delegates.The largest number of known lobbyists in recent years were representing state-owned companies from the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Azerbaijan.Many of the world’s most profitable fossil fuel corporations have also been present at recent Cop summits, at a time when governments faced huge public pressure – but failed – to agree to phase out fossil fuels despite deadly climate impacts affecting every corner of the planet.Between 2021 and 2024, Shell sent a combined total of 37 lobbyists, BP sent 36,ExxonMobil32 and Chevron 20.In thepast five years,the four oil majors made more than $420bn in combined profits.On Friday the Exxon CEO, Darren Woods, will headline a Cop30 launch event in Brasília hosted by the US chamber of commerce called Pragmatic Business Solutions for Carbon Accounting and Emission Reductions. The US, which like every state is legally obliged under international law to tackle the climate crisis, has withdrawn from the Paris agreement and is not sending a country delegation to the summit.Petrobas, the majority-state-owned Brazilian multinational which sent at least 28 lobbyists to the past four climate summits, was recently grant eda licence to conduct exploratoryoil drilling in the sea off the Amazon, which is home to multiple Indigenous communities and about 10% of the planet’s known species.A spokesperson said: “Petrobras will be present at COP30, as it has been at previous talks, because it recognizes the opportunity to discuss sustainable models … The company’s participation in COP30 reinforces its commitment to follow and contribute to international debates on climate and energy.”Shell, BP, ExxonMobil and Chevron did not respond to requests for comment.After years of campaigning by civil society groups, Cop delegates this year are being asked to publicly disclose who is funding their participation – and confirm that their objectives are in alignment with the UNFCCC. But the new transparency requirement excludes anyone in official government delegations or overflows, and calls forstricter conflict of interestprotections to cut industry influence have not been adequately heeded, advocates say.“The new rules are a welcome start, but they come decades too late … and transparency without exclusion is performative. You cannot claim to fix a process already captured by the very corporations burning the planet and fuelling wars,” said Mohammed Usrof, executive director of the Palestinian Institute for Climate Strategy. “The UNFCCC must move from disclosure to disqualification … without reform this process will not save the world, and instead, will just help bury it.”In a statement, a spokesperson for the UN climate change agency said: “The secretariat has taken concrete steps forward in 2023 and again this year to enhance the transparency of COP participants. Just as no single COP can be expected to solve the climate crisis overnight, further improvements is an ongoing journey which we will keep supporting, noting that national governments have sole authority to decide who is in their delegations.”Explore more on these topicsFossil fuelsCop30Oil (Business)Oil (Environment)ExxonMobilBPOil and gas companiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Economistspolledby the Wall Street Journal expected a 53.0 index reading.The monthly index of consumer sentiment was last this low in June 2022, at 50.0, amid inflation during the Covid pandemic. The latest reading is thelowestreported by the index since at least 1978.“With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” said Joanne Hsu, director of the survey, in astatement.“This month’s decline in sentiment was widespread throughout the population, seen across age, income, and political affiliation.”The results come amid a blackout on federal data, such as the monthly jobs report, which was due on Friday, with the usual slate of monthly reports suspended due to the government shutdown. In their absence, investors have been turning to smaller, privately funded research reports.This week ADP, the US’s largest payroll supplier, said private employers added 42,000 new jobs in October, better than expected but still a dramatic slowdown from thethree-monthmoving average from November to January of 188,000 jobs.On Thursday, the outplacement and executive coaching firmChallenger, Gray & Christmassaid US-based employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October, up 175% from the 55,597 cuts announced in October 2024. It was the highest level of layoff for any October since 2003.“Americans are losing faith in the economy because they’re losing ground. Every day it becomes clearer that President Trump has no real interest in improving the lives of American families,” said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at the thinktank Groundwork Collaborative, in a statement on the Michigan survey report.“His economic mismanagement has left households buried under record debt and rising prices. It’s no surprise consumer sentiment is at its lowest point since 2022 and households are turning to leaders who didn’t just learn the word ‘affordability’.”Explore more on these topicsUS economyEconomicsUS unemployment and employment datanewsShareReuse this content"

Trump’s tariffs on Brazil, a major beef exporter, have also curbed imports.Trump’s accusations have renewed a bipartisan presidential fight against rising food prices.Then president Joe Biden talked with independent farmers and ranchers about initiatives to reduce food prices by increasing competition within the meat industry. And the then vice-president, Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated last year, used her campaign to vow to crack down on food producers and major supermarkets “price gouging”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Beijing retaliated by halting all exports from Nexperia’s factories in the country, threatening todisrupt car production in Europe and Japan.The White House had put Wingtech on a list of companies that would have their exports to the US controlled under its “affiliate rule”. However, as part of the deal between Trump and Xi in South Korea, the US authorities will now delay the implementation of this rule for a year in exchange for China pausing its own restrictions on exports of chips andcrucial rare-earth minerals.The Dutch economy minister, Vincent Karremans, said on Thursday he trusted that Nexperia chips would reach customers inEuropeand the rest of the world in the coming days.Meanwhile, one of the main suppliers to the German car industry, Aumovio, confirmed on Friday it had received notice fromChinathat chips supply would resume to its operations.“We applied for and received an exemption from the export restrictions. We received it ‌the day before yesterday verbally, yesterday in writing,” Aumovio’s chief executive, Philipp von Hirschheydt, said after the company reported ⁠its third-quarter results.At the heart of the dispute is control of Nexperia’s operations in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, after the company was acquired by the partially state-owned Wingtech in 2018. Karremans took control of the chipmaker on 30 September amid fears its operations and intellectual property would be moved to China.Nexperia in the Netherlands said it was pleased by the one-year suspension of the US affiliate rule and also welcomed China’s commitment to “facilitate the resumption of exports” from the company’s Chinese facility.But it added that there continued to be some concerns and that it could not tell “if or when” products from its facility in China would be delivered.The row that threatened to halt car assembly lines in Europe underlines the global nature of car industry’s supply chain and the vulnerability of European and Japanese companies that rely on China for chips.US authorities had also raised security concerns about Wingtech and Nexperia’s Chinese chief executive, Zhang Xuezheng, in June, court documents show.Four days after the seizure, China banned exports from Nexperia’s factories in the country, where about 70% of its chips are packaged before distribution. By the end of last month, Nexperia had retaliated byhalting chip supplies to a Chinese plant.Bloomberg reports on Friday cited sources who said the Dutch government was ready to shelve the order that gave it power to block or change key corporate decisions at Nexperia on the condition that China resumed exports of critical chips.Karremans said the Netherlands had been informed by Beijing and Washington that the deal struck by Trump and Xi last month would enable the resumption of supplies from Nexperia’s facilities in China.“This is also consistent with information provided to the European Commission by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryEuropeChinaAsia PacificNetherlandsnewsShareReuse this content"

But we saw that with theGreat Gatsby theme partylast week. They just can’t seem to stop doing things that are shockingly out of touch.“We’ve been through shutdowns before, and while obviously the White House bubble is always somewhat insane, presidents are usually smart enough, they usually know not to flaunt this type of stuff. But this administration does not seem to care.”The president’s hour-long address on Thursday had the flavor of a political rally, with familiar insults for old political foes such as the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and a new one:Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected democratic socialist mayor of New York.View image in fullscreenJeff Bezos speaks speaks at the America Business Forum on Thursday.Photograph: Rebecca Blackwell/APTrump touched on his economic agenda, and lauded a host of speakers from the worlds of politics, sport and business that filled the two-day agenda, created largely by Francis Suarez, mayor of the city of Miami, to showcase south Florida and its investment opportunities.Lionel Messi, the Argentina soccer star and World Cup winner, provided celebrity glitz from sporting circles, along with tennis champions Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams. A conversation between Suarez and María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader and democracy activist who last monthwon the Nobel peace prizethat Trump coveted, was well received on day one.Yet overall it was a curious and unmistakably politically charged event with a field of Trump sycophants on the stage, loudly cheered by a crowd of mostly younger and affluent supporters of the president in the audience, some blending business suits with his trademark red Make America Great Again (Maga) caps.How else to explain the presence of Javier Milei, the rightwing president of Argentina, the country whose shaky economy Trumphelped shore up last monthwith a $20bn currency swap lifeline? Or that of Saudi Arabians Fahad AlSaif, head of its$925bn Public Investment Fund, and Reema Bandar Al-Saud, Riyadh’s ambassador to the US, touting their country as ripe for investment while theTrump family’s financial tiesandinfluencethere come under greater scrutiny?Then there was Gianni Infantino, head of Fifa, international soccer’s governing body, dropping hints that Trump is in line for the organization’s first peace prize,an unwanted new awardthat observers see created specially for the president as consolation for his Nobel snub.Other speakers, includingJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan;Adam Neumann, founder of WeWork and Flow; andGriffin, the hedge-fund manager and Republican donor; have all previously praised, worked with or voted for Trump, offering more than a suggestion of a politically skewed lineup.Suarez, unsurprisingly, saw it differently.“We wanted it to be a sort of a cross-section from different verticals, right?” he told the Guardian.“We got in a room. We said, ‘Hey, what are the leading voices?’ People from different backgrounds, different ethnicities, different genders … sports, business, politics, technology, things that touch everyone’s lives.”He pointed to discussions of upcoming, money-spinning notable events in Miami, including the Formula One grand prix, next year’s G20 economic summitat Trump’s Doral golf resort, and games during the 2026 World Cup, which he called “a generational opportunity”.“Our hope is that Miamians are transformed by the experience,” Suarez said. “We want them to leave thinking, ‘I can be on that stage.’”View image in fullscreenSerena Williams speaks on 6 November 2025.Photograph: Alexander Tamargo/Getty Images for America Business ForumThe advocates of State Voices Florida, however, believe many Miamians are more focused right now on other issues, especially soaring housing and food costs. Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantisrejected a callfrom Hannan’s group and others to declare an emergency over Snap benefits and tap state reserves to fund urgent food distribution.“Any civics teacher would tell you it’s his job to look after the people of Florida, and he’s doing the exact opposite,” Hannan said, noting the juxtaposition of a conference of billionaires taking place in the same county in which almost 25% of households rely on Snap benefits to survive.“There just seems to be this detachment at the top. I don’t think the answer is electing a Democrat or electing a Republican, I just think we have to have more empathy for people who are struggling in this state.”Empathy was in short supply in Miami from Trump, a presidentnot known for ever taking responsibilityduring a crisis.“The radical left Democrats are causing millions of Americans who depend on food stamps to go without benefits,” he said, blaming the out-of-office opposition party for the government shutdown.“I just want to have a country that’s great again.

My heart is with the families, friends and colleagues of all who were lost in this week’s tragedy. We will get through this together,” Greenberg wrote in asocial media post.A statement from UPS listed the pilots aboard the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 as Captain Richard Wartenberg, First Officer Lee Truitt, and International Relief Officer Captain Dana Diamond.“Our hearts go out to every UPSer who has been impacted and all in our Louisville community – supporting you and ensuring you receive the care and resources you need is our priority,” the company’sstatementread.0:36CCTV captures moment UPS cargo plane crashes near Kentucky airport – video“Our hope is that we have located all of the victims at this point. But again, we do not know,” Greenberg said earlier in the day.A federal investigator announced earlier on Wednesday the UPS cargo plane’s left wing caught fire and an engine fell off shortly after takeoff from the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport, causing the plane tocrash and explodeinto a fireball.The National Transportation Safety Board has said it is investigating the plane’s maintenance history which was in Texas for repairs weeks before the crash.Reuters reported flight tracking data showing the plane was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, from 3 September to 18 October.“We are aware that this aircraft was there in San Antonio,” said Todd Inman, an NTSB member, on Thursday, without giving a specific time frame. “We will look at every piece of maintenance that was done, even from the San Antonio time, all the way to the date of the flight.”The cockpit voice recorder and data recorder were recovered, and the engine was discovered on the airfield.The recorders – known as black boxes – were built to withstand crash impacts and intense heat from fires, and they appeared to be intact when located amid the crash debris. Investigators plan on reviewing data from the black boxes.Inman said the plane’s final data recordings showed an altitude of 475ft, and a speed of 210mph before the crash.Singapore-based ST Engineering, which said it provides airframe maintenance for UPS’s MD-11 aircraft and operates a repair facility in San Antonio, declined to comment, but said it would cooperate fully when relevant authorities reached out to it.According to Federal Aviation Administration records dated 18 September, a crack on a structural piece inside the center wing fuel tank required repairs.Meanwhile, UPS Worldport operations resumed on Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said. All three runways at Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport were also open again.The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company’s largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.A candlelight vigil was held on the evening of 6 November by the local Teamsters Union, which represents workers at the Louisville airport, the company’s largest air cargo hub.Teamsters Local 89, which represents UPS workers, began the vigil with a moment of silence at 5.14pm, the approximate time of the crash two days earlier.“This incident was so sudden, so unexpected,” the mayor told the crowd of 200. “No one had a chance to say goodbye to any of those who we have lost.”Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsKentuckyLouisvillenewsShareReuse this content"

Musk’s fortune, which includes a stake of about 12.5% in Tesla, is already worth $461bn.“Musk isTeslaand Tesla is Musk,” says Dan Ives, a managing director at the US financial firm Wedbush. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”Trump reverses course to renominate billionaire Musk ally to lead NasaRead moreIves is a self-described Tesla “core bull” who nonetheless has consistently raised concerns about the damage that the chief executive’s political stance has been doing to one of the world’s best-known brands.Tesla sales suffered as Musk’s on-off relationship with Trump –funding his presidential campaignand his stintleading sweeping cutsat the “department of government efficiency” – damaged the appeal of its vehicles to a left-leaning consumer base.There were signs of trouble before that as well, with market research firm Strategic Vision recording a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Muskbought Twitter(now X) in 2022,rolled back content moderationon the platform andreinstated banned accounts.Other off-putting factors have been swirling around the Trump soap opera, such as reports of Musk’salleged extensive drug consumption, his public support forfar-right political partiesand makingfascist-style salutes at political rallies.At one point in March, Ives warned that Tesla and Musk were embroiled in a “brand tornado crisis moment” as the backlash against the boss’s behaviour became a global problem amid falling sales. Other factors were at play in Tesla’s commercial wobbles, not least stiff competition from Chinese-made vehicles, but Musk’s notoriety has had an impact.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shares in Tesla have risen by nearly two-thirds since May, when the Tesla chief executive announced he wasleaving the Trump administration(and then worrying investors by falling out with the president publicly). Third-quarter deliveries – a proxy for sales –trounced Wall Street estimates last monththanks to US consumers taking advantage of expiring federal tax credits for electric vehicles, although European sales suffered and analysts warned that Musk needs to cushion a post-credit slowdown by selling cheaper models.Another factor is the culture among US investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged and Jeff Bezos had a long reign at the top of Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Indeed, most Tesla shareholders seemed concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company, instead of wanting him to leave altogether.“Money talks in the US more,” says Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”Other incentives in Musk’s$1tn pay packageinclude delivering 20m Tesla vehicles, 10m self-driving car subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots and 1m robotaxis. These targets, particularly the robots and autonomous vehicles, require the kind of entrepreneurial and technological chutzpah that Musk has shown at Tesla and his rocket company SpaceX.Matthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst, says the added value Musk has brought to Tesla’s stock is “undeniable” and has made “many people rich, including himself”.However, Schmidt adds that Tesla’s core car business has reached its peak and describes the autonomous vehicle plans as “certainly not the best in the market”.“Have shareholders been naively blind-sided by past achievements rather than the foresight of future prospects? Perhaps!” he says.Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaTechnology sectorThe super-richCorporate governanceExecutive pay and bonusesAutomotive industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

He hit 335 homers and had 1,000 RBIs and 221 stolen bases in 17 seasons.Plagued by later legal, health and personal problems, Strawberry was indicted for tax evasion and eventually pleaded guilty in 1995 to a single felony count. That was based on his failure to report $350,000 in income from autographs, personal appearances and sales of memorabilia.Alex vs ARod: the baseball legend turned ‘recovering narcissist’ tells allRead moreStrawberry agreed to pay more than $430,000 as part of the case. He was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy in 1998.The following year, Strawberry was sentenced to probation and suspended from baseball after pleading no contest to charges of possession of cocaine and soliciting a prostitute. He eventually spoke in court about struggling with depression, and was charged with violating his probation numerous times – including on his 40th birthday in 2002.Strawberry ultimately served 11 months in Florida state prison, and was released in 2003.A White House official said Friday that Trump approved a pardon for Strawberry, who had served time and paid back taxes. Speaking on condition of anonymity to detail a pardon that had not yet been formally announced, the official noted that Strawberry found faith in Christianity and has been sober for more than a decade, and that he’d become active in ministry and started a still-active recovery center.Strawberryposted on Instagrama picture of himself and Trump and wrote, “Thank you, President @realdonaldtrump for my full pardon and for finalizing this part of my life, allowing me to be truly free and clean from all of my past.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

Curious, I answered, and to my amazement, the lady on the line said, ‘Darryl Strawberry, you have a call from the President of the United States,Donald Trump,’” Strawberry wrote. “I put it on speakerphone with my wife nearby, and President Trump spoke warmly about my baseball days in NYC, praising me as one the greatest player of the ’80s and celebrating the Mets. Then, he told me he was granting me a full pardon from my past.”Trump was a New York real estate mogul before becoming a reality television star and twice winning the presidency.Strawberry said he was “overwhelmed with gratitude — thanking God for setting me free from my past, helping me become a better Man, Husband and Father.”“This experience has deepened my faith and commitment to working for His kingdom as a true follower of Jesus Christ,” Strawberry wrote, while also noting, “This has nothing to do with politics – it’s about a Man, President Trump, caring deeply for a friend. God used him as a vessel to set me free forever!”View image in fullscreenDarryl Strawberry, center, plays referee with Doc Gooden and Mike Tyson during his New York Mets heyday.Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News/Getty ImagesThe president has broad constitutional powers to grant pardons, which don’t expunge the recipient’s criminal record but can be seen as acts of justice or mercy, often in cases that can further public welfare.Strawberry’s followed Trump issuing pardons this week for a former Republican speaker of the Tennessee House and a onetime aide on public corruption charges. It also adds to a list of celebrities and political allies who have similarly received unlikely pardons – including a former Republican governor of Connecticut, an ex-GOP congressman and reality TV stars who had been convicted of cheating banks and evading taxes.Strawberry played for the Mets, New York Yankees, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants between 1983 and 1999. He won the World Series with the 1986 Mets, starring alongside the likes of Dwight Gooden and Keith Hernandez, and with the Yankees in 1996, 1998 and 1999.Strawberry was hospitalized with a heart attack in March 2024, a day before he turned 62. That same year, the Mets retired his No. 18 and an emotional Strawberry told the Citi Field crowd: “I’m truly, deeply sorry that I ever left you guys. I never played baseball in front of fans greater than you guys.”Explore more on these topicsBaseballDonald TrumpNew York MetsMLBUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Norris leads Piastri by one point, with the defending champion, Verstappen, 36 points back, after a late-season resurgence.In 1950 the dominant Alfa Romeo 158 in the hands of Juan Manuel Fangio, Nino Farina and Luigi Fagioli held sway. Fangio entered the final round at Monza two points ahead of Fagioli with Farina four behind. The championship was contested across only six races. Norris, Piastri and Verstappen still have more than half that to go in their four remaining meetings.View image in fullscreenJuan Manuel Fangio leads Nino Farina and Luigi Fagioli – all three in the dominant Alfa Romeo 158 – at the start of the 1950 French Grand Prix.Photograph: LAT Images/Getty ImagesThe former era is all but unrecognisable now but the competitive edge, increased complexity and intensity of a three-way fight remain the same. At Monza that year, the season turned when Fangio retired his car with a gearbox problem. Fagioli could manage only third and it was Farina, from third in the standings, who took the title.It was not the last time the championship was decided in a three-way contest over the final stretch and, for the moment at Interlagos, Norris and Piastri are the leading contenders and their lead over Verstappen is still formidable. Yet their task has been made immeasurably more thorny by Verstappen entering what had been a head-to-head race between the two teammates.McLaren have tried to play it fair between the pair all season, a luxury they could afford whileRed Bullfloundered, but laudably letting them fight has meant neither driver has established a dominant lead and Verstappen has managed to just stay in touch. McLaren are more than aware of how this scenario has played out in the past for good and ill.In 1986 Williams’s Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet and McLaren’s Alain Prost were in a three-way fight going into the finale in Adelaide. Williams had dominated all season but Mansell and Piquet, between whom there was no love lost, had taken points off one another and kept Prost in the game.View image in fullscreenNelson Piquet, Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell at the Australian Grand Prix in 1986. Prost emerged with the title after a tight three-way battle.Photograph: DPPI/ShutterstockWhen Mansell suffered a tyre failure late in the race and Williams took Piquet into the pits as a precaution it was Prost who took the lead, the win and the title.Similarly in 2007, McLaren’s Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso went at it while Ferrari’s Kimi Räikkönen had just held on to be in with a shout at the end. Hamilton’s retirement as he slid out on worn tyres in China and then a gearbox problem at the finale in Brazil ended his chances of a title in his debut season. Räikkönen took victory at Interlagos and the title. It was the first time since Farina that a driver had snuck in from third place at the death.“We always take a look at history. We always try to understand what happened, all the lessons learned,” said the McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, in Brazil on Friday. Yet the team are clear they are determined to leave the competition in the hands of their drivers and accept the risk it carries, as the chief executive, Zak Brown, said this week.View image in fullscreenKimi Räikkönen in front of Lewis Hamilton (left) and Fernando Alonso at the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos in 2007. Räikkönen won the race and the F1 title.Photograph: Víctor R Caivano/AP“I’d rather go: ‘We did the best we can on our drivers tied in points and the other beat us by one,’ than the alternative,” he said. “Which is telling one of our drivers when they’re one point away from each other: ‘I know you have a dream to win the world championship but we flipped the coin and you don’t get to do it this year.’ Forget it.“That’s not how we go racing. In the event that 2007 happens again, I’d rather have that outcome than all the other outcomes by playing favourites. We won’t do it.”Quick GuideNorris gets better of rivals to land sprint pole in BrazilShowLando Norris delivered under intense pressure to take pole position for Saturday's sprint race at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix.Norris, who reclaimed the world championship lead with a statement win in Mexico a fortnight ago, will have a golden opportunity to further extend his advantage with both of his title rivals behind him on the grid for Saturday's 24-lap dash to the chequered flag in Interlagos.Oscar Piastri, just one point adrift of Norris with 114 points still to play for across the remaining four contests, is third on the grid. Max Verstappen, 36 points behind Norris, is only sixth as he complained his Red Bull was \"completely broken\" and \"just undriveable\".Among the championship contenders, Kimi Antonelli qualified second, with George Russell fourth in the other Mercedes. Fernando Alonso is a place ahead of Verstappen in fifth.PA SportWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Norris and Piastri know what they have to do then – beat one another and finish ahead of Verstappen. However, the latter has no intention of going quietly into the night. Rather, the Dutchman looms as Banquo’s ghost, undoubtedly playing on their minds.His position is more difficult given that one DNF would see him off but equally he had not expected to be in this position so has nothing to lose. He is making McLaren look in their mirrors and contributing to the pressure that engenders errors – potentially disastrous when there are three variables at play.As Ferrari discovered when they miscalculated at Abu Dhabi in 2010, pitting Alonso to cover off Mark Webber only to leave the Spaniard bottled up behind Vitaly Petrov, allowing Sebastian Vettel to nip in and take the title. The only time he had led all season.Such is the nature of a three-way tussle and as Farina, Prost, Räikkönen and Vettel proved, nothing can be ruled out until the points are sealed. Amid all of which fate too will surely play a part. Witness John Surtees taking the title in his three-way fight in 1964 after Jim Clark lost oil late in the finale at Mexico. Or as Jack Brabham ground to a halt out of fuel on the final lap at Sebring in his three-way scrap in 1959 and finished the job only by pushing his car over the line.Drama tends to follow these enticing battles, as Norris, Piastri and Verstappen are more than aware. There are twists and turns surely yet to come before this deal is done.Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenFormula OneMotor sportMcLarenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then Sabalenka again demonstrated her peerless fighting spirit by holding off Amanda Anisimova in a brilliant encounter to win 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.After playing her best tennis of the season over the past few weeks to qualify for theWTA Finals, Rybakina entered Riyadh filled with confidence and this has shown in her performances throughout the tournament. Like Sabalenka, the Kazakhstani has reached the final with a spotless scorecard, winning all four of her matches.Still, things were difficult early on against Pegula. Rybakina was unsettled by the American’s relentless depth, consistency and ability to absorb her pace. She ended the opening set with 25 unforced errors while repeatedly gesturing towards her right shoulder, which was bandaged from the beginning of the match. However, as she worked herself into the contest, Rybakina completely overpowered Pegula during parts of the final two sets with her clean, destructive groundstrokes and she ended the match with 15 aces.View image in fullscreenElena Rybakina made her power tell despite nursing an injury to her right shoulder.Photograph: Fatima Shbair/APAs was the case inSeptember’s US Open final, Sabalenka’s performance against Anisimova underlined her growth as a tennis player and competitor. The 24-year-old Anisimova has established herself as the purest shotmaker in women’s tennis. Instead of merely trying to outhit her, Sabalenka won through a superior defence, intelligence and an ability to absorb Anisimova’s immense pace, impressively outmanoeuvring the American to reach the final stage of the WTA Finals for the second time.Elsewhere, Novak Djokovic moved into the final of the Hellenic Championship in Athens with a comfortable 6-3, 6-4 win over Yannick Hanfmann. Djokovic’s victory means that he will have minimal rest should he choose to compete at the ATP Finals, which begins just one day after Saturday’s final, and where the rest of the competitors have spent the last two days preparing for the start of the competition.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He listed current target countries as Britain (with the potential host cities there being London and Manchester), France (Paris and Lyon), Spain (Madrid and Barcelona), Italy (Rome and Milan), Germany (Munich and Berlin), Greece (Athens) and Turkey (Istanbul). No deals with any city or club have been formally announced by the NBA at this point.The other four teams in the league could qualify by winning either Fiba’sBasketballChampions League or through their performance in domestic leagues in Europe, Aivagolozu said.That possible element – having teams qualify through the domestic league finishes – “is probably the most exciting part of the plan, because we all know that the domestic leagues today are not necessarily what they had been 20 or 30 years ago”, Aivagolozu said.It’s unclear when the NBA could announce anything formally about the launch date or the initial list of franchises. The NBA is sending the Orlando Magic and Memphis Grizzlies to play in Berlin and London in mid-January.Aivagolozu’s comments Friday were among the most concrete yet regarding the NBA’s plans for the new league, though it should be noted that talks are continuing with teams, investors and other stakeholders.“We’re well underway in our approach and engagement with the market,” Aivagolozu said. “We’re having serious discussions with respect to investors.”Also being discussed, Aivogolozu said, is having teams from the NBA and Europe meet in some sort of competition, possibly similar to what soccer governing body Fifa has done with its Club World Cup.“One of the things that we’ll do very soon after we launch this league is probably create a new tournament,” Aivogolozu said.The NBA and Fiba, basketball’s world governing body, announced plans in March to pursue a new European league – ending years of speculation about when or if such a move would happen. The process has been moving rapidly and a substantial move earlier this year came when the NBA brought on JPMorgan Chase and Raine Group to advise on finances and strategy.Existing European clubs like Real Madrid, Fenerbahce and Barcelona have long been known to figure into the NBA’s plans for the new league, along with other top soccer brands like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain.About one in every six current NBA players hails from Europe, including Denver’s Nikola Jokić from Serbia and Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo from Greece – a duo that has combined for five of the league’s last seven MVP awards. The Los Angeles Lakers’ Luka Dončić is from Slovenia. and San Antonio superstarVictor Wembanyamais from France.Explore more on these topicsBasketballNBAUS sportsLuka DončićNikola JokićVictor WembanyamaShareReuse this content"

The NCAA said a student-athlete overheard the three players discuss a third party placing a bet on their game against McNeese State on 28 December 2024. New Orleans lost 86-61.That same student-athlete reported that during a timeout near the end of the game, Short instructed him not to score any more points. New Orleans suspended all three student-athletes for the remainder of the season while it investigated the allegations.The NCAA investigation showed that the three players manipulated their performances in seven games from December through January to lose by more points than the spread for that game.The violations against Freeman were uncovered when the NCAA reviewed text messages involving Mykell Robinson, who played at Fresno State. Records on Robinson’s phone indicated that on four separate occasions between November and December 2024, Freeman knowingly provided information to Robinson, who was betting on Freeman through daily fantasy sports accounts.Freeman also knowingly provided information on at least two occasions to his then-girlfriend, who was also betting on Freeman.The NCAA said last month that it had been investigating at least 30 current or former players for gambling issues.Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsBasketballNCAAShareReuse this content"

The country’s new Safe Sport director says the omission exposes a major gap — and is calling for a global registry of banned coaches.Matthew HallFri 7 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 08.03 ESTShareTwo years after receiving an 18-month jail sentence for sexually assaulting players under his care, a formerCanadawomen’s national team coach is yet to appear on any public sanctions list published by Canada Soccer or BC Soccer, the regional governing body for soccer in British Columbia, where the crimes took place.The revelation has prompted the executive director of the Canadian organization newly appointed to manage reports of abuse and misconduct to call for an international registry of offenders to track individuals who have been banned from sports for misconduct.Bob Birarda, a formerVancouver Whitecapswomen’s team and Canada under-20 women’s coach, pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual assault and one charge of forcible touching in 2022. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail in November that year.Following Birarda’s sentencing in November 2022, Vancouver Whitecaps current CEO Axel Schuster pledged that the club’s response to allegations would “reach a higher standard today” than when Birarda committed his crimes (Schuster was not yet employed by the Whitecaps at the time).“We acknowledge and understand the deep hurt felt across our soccer community,” Schustersaid in a statement. “We are truly sorry to everyone who has been impacted.”Canada Soccer, a co-host of the 2026 Fifa World Cup with Mexico and the United States, confirmed to the Guardian that it had banned Birarda from coaching but did not respond to a request for clarification of when the suspension was invoked and whether Canada Soccer published a list of individuals sanctioned by the organization.“Canada Soccer can confirm that Mr Birarda has received a lifetime suspension from coaching registration with no opportunity for re-training, recertification, or re-evaluation of coaching licence in Canada,” Paulo Senra, a spokesperson for Canada Soccer, wrote in an email to the Guardian.Coaching licenses in North America are mostly used to indicate a level of coaching education and are generally not required for employment purposes unless stipulated by a specific league or organization.Asked why Birarda was absent from BC Soccer’spublic list of sanctioned individuals, CEO Gabriel Assis said in an emailed statement that its published database reflects only individuals banned by the provincial governing body.“The BC Soccer Discipline and Sanctions list displayed on our website reflects sanctions issued by BC Socceronly[original emphasis],” Assis wrote. “While we do not publish sanctions imposed by other governing bodies or tribunals, BC Soccer fully complies with those decisions and enforces them within our jurisdiction. Our policies permanently exclude individuals convicted of criminal offenses, including sexual abuse, from participating in all soccer related activities under BC Soccer.”BC Soccer did not respond to a further request for clarification regarding when it received notification of a Birarda ban and from whom, whether any communication was made public, if BC Soccer can issue a concurrent ban, and why Birarda, whose crimes took place in the Vancouver area while employed by organizations under the BC Soccer umbrella, was not sanctioned by local soccer authorities. Currently, there is no readily available information from Canadian soccer governing bodies relating to any sanctions levied against Birarda.The Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport, a government organization that manages doping in Canada, took charge of abuse complaint management in the country earlier this year. Signy Arnason, CCES’s Executive Director of Safe Sport, described Birarda’s absence from a public database as “a perfect example of a serious gap that needs to be fixed - no question”.“We need one national registry and you could also be exploring [historical] registries for serious cases that may involve sexual offenses as well,” Arnason said.Both Canada Soccer and the Vancouver Whitecaps were widely criticized for how the organizations failed to adequately handle complaints about Birarda’s behavior over many years. Allegations about Birarda surfaced in 2008 and led to more than a decade-long fight by former players for justice. The Birarda case became a leading example of how the leadership of sports organizations failed to take authoritative action on allegations and concerns about misconduct.In 2019,14 former Canada national team players signed a letterclaiming Canada Soccer and the Vancouver Whitecaps had failed to protect players from abusive behavior by coaches after it was revealed Birarda was coaching high-level youth soccer in Vancouver even after being released years earlier from his contracts with the national team and the Whitecaps.Andrea Neil, an icon of women’s soccer in Canada, saidin a statementat the time that an investigation by a lawyer hired by Canada Soccer and the Whitecaps failed to interview many players about allegations concerning the coach’s behavior. Neil said she was told by the investigating lawyer that it would be recommended that Birarda be banned from coaching.At a team meeting before departing for a World Cup, U-20 national team players recalled Canada Soccer board member Victor Montaglian, now president of Concacaf, announcing Birarda was suddenly leaving his coaching role. A media release announced the departure was by mutual consent yet gave no reason. Still, Birarda took up and held for several years a position coaching young women with a prominent Vancouver-area club team.A police investigation was eventually opened in 2020 amid media reports on inaction by Canadian soccer authorities. Birarda eventually pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual assault and one charge of sexual touching.The Canadian government subsequently held multiple inquiries into abuse in sport over the past several years. Victor Montagliani, in his role as a former Canada Soccer president, and Peter Montopoli, the organization’s former CEO, were called to face questions from elected officials. Montagliani is now President of Concacaf, the host confederation for the Fifa World Cup 2026. Montopoli is COO of the Fifa World Cup 2026 Canada.The Canadian government’s inquiries led to restructuring how complaints are handled in the country. CCES took charge of the complaint process for federally-funded sports organizations in April 2025.“We heard that there needs to be a more trauma-informed approach,” Arnason said. “There was a call for improved and more transparent communication in the process, like people not feeling like they were lost and submitting a report and not hearing for months. We are the decision makers on violations and sanctions.“A lot of times you set up these programs and you bring in people with a sports background. This is not an area where that is what you need. But you also need to have an education and training and experience that is specific to the areas of maltreatment.”A new CCES safe sport registry lists individuals sanctioned by the organization since April. An automatic sanction applies to any sports participant “convicted of a Criminal Code offence for conduct considered to be Prohibited Behaviour”.In the United States, the US Center for Safe Sport publishes acentralized disciplinary databaseacross multiple sports governed by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) including soccer, tennis, hockey, boxing, and track and field. The database names individuals that have been sanctioned including temporary suspensions, restrictions and bans.Recent reasons for sanctions in the US included sexual misconduct and crime involving a minor, an intimate relationship involving a power imbalance, physical misconduct, retaliation, sexual harassment, as well as the broader description of simple “misconduct”.Arnason said she wants to establish a registry that tracks misconduct nationally and internationally: “We know that people move through the systems and that they move through the provincial level and the club level.”“They may be sanctioned at one level but there is no awareness at another level that this person is dangerous in relation to their participation in sport. We also know that people not only move within their own country but that they move internationally and there has to be a better sharing of information across countries.”“The question now is how do we start to apply more pressure on the system to be more transparent around people who, quite frankly, should never be participating in sport again? They are a danger. These are all things that absolutely need to be a part of a national dialogue here in Canada but also internationally.”Explore more on these topicsCanada women's football teamCanadaUS sportsVancouver WhitecapsUnited States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC)featuresShareReuse this content"

The Current made a mockery of that notion, winning 21 and drawing two out of their 26 games to finish 21 points ahead of second-place Washington. Their goal difference was an absurd plus-36, scoring seven more goals than any other team and conceding 12 fewer than anyone else.Beau Dure… Kansas City’s dominance.While Temwa Chawinga followed up her impressive NWSL debut last season to again lead the league in scoring, it was the Current’s lockdown defense that kept them from losing a single game at home on their way to breaking the NWSL points record.Jakub FrankowiczWomen’s soccer faces plenty of serious threats. So why the panic about trans players? | Lesley RyderRead more… a tight crowd in the middle.There’s only a six-point gap in the standings between third-place Portland and unlucky ninth-place North Carolina. The middle cluster of teams was jostling all season, proving the league’s calling-card of parity. But Kansas City’s supremacy only emphasizes the inconsistency of that core bunch, a result of the relatively low salary cap. If the league wants its competition to be of the highest quality, it must raise its standards.Abigail SegelThe health of the league is ...… just fine.Attendance dropped by 5% from 2024, but that’s no cause for alarm, especially with a lot of star players out on maternity leave or dealing with long-term injuries. TV broadcasts are all over the place in both the literal (many different networks) and figurative (erratic quality). Commentators tend to fawn over routine plays while griping far more than is needed about the referees. But those are trivial issues in a big picture that looks bright. Next year, Denver welcomes a new team, and women’s pro soccer makes a long-overdue return to Boston.BD… strong.While attendance slipped a bit in 2025 compared to the peaks of 2024, a number of big name departures were responsible. The NWSL will be back with expansion in Boston and Denver in 2026, and the men’s World Cup will also likely increase the interest towards all soccer in the US.JF… dependent on what your priorities are.There was only a slight drop in overall match attendance numbers (not too concerning in a year without the Olympics or World Cup) and Jessica Berman inked a shiny new TV deal, but leadership bungled several moments that put people around the league at risk. Forcing Angel City and Utah to continue playing afterSavy King collapsedon the field, saying the league has “no duty of care” to victims of harassment in San Diego, putting players and fans in danger in extreme heat in Kansas City due to a national broadcast window, and, most recently, failing to adequately protect marginalized players from transphobic, racist hate indicate that the league isn’t a healthy place for many of its members.ASBest team that didn’t make the playoffsAs obvious as it may seem to pick the ninth-place team, it’s strange to see the playoffs without theNorth Carolina Couragein the mix. Japanese phenom Manaka Matsukobo had 11 goals, but no one else on the team had more than three. Jaedyn Shaw’s arrival was supposed to invigorate the offense, but the Courage sold her to Gotham FC during the season.BDNorth Carolina Courage, who won their final two matches via a flurry of goals from Manaka Matsukubo. But they’ll rue losing their 4 Octobe tie with Racing Louisville, who put together a strong final five matches to make it into the playoffs after years of close misses.JFUndoubtedly, theNorth Carolina Courage. They were only above the playoff line for two weeks in the whole season, but they were always knocking on the door. Twenty-year-old Manaka Matsukubo had an MVP-caliber season, and the team was high on the list of goals scored (fourth, with 37). They weathered the sudden firing of manager Sean Nahas in August and the two-month absence of captain and midfield anchor Denise O’Sullivan shortly thereafter, but not even a thrashing of Gotham on Decision Day could push them over the line.ASDark horsesAnyone who isn’t Kansas City?Twenty-one points separated the Current from the second-place Spirit. The gap between the Spirit and eighth-place Gotham FC was only eight, and the injury-riddled Spirit aren’t playing like the second-best team in the league. No result other than a Current loss would be an upset. But to pick one, let’s go with the best coach in league history: Laura Harvey, who is already a tactical mastermind andis now using AIto give the Seattle Reign even more of an edge.BDIt’s been a feast or famine season forGotham FCas they managed the second-best goal differential despite being the eighth seed. But if they defeat the Goliath-like Current in the first round, they’ll be full of self-confidence and have recent championship experience. That’s a big if, however.JFSan Diego Wave.They played to a valiant loss against goliath Kansas City on Decision Day, and midseason acquisition Dudhina might be the X-factor that could cause chaos in the bracket. Jonas Eidevall’s team loves possession, and at their best they can make opponents run circles around them. I give Portland a slight edge in the quarter-final because Providence Park isn’t friendly to visitors, but Gotham won there on the way to their 2023 championship win, so anything’s possible.ASView image in fullscreenWashington’s Gift Monday is the Spirit’s leading scorer on the year with eight goals.Photograph: Rich Storry/NWSL/Getty ImagesBig team at risk of going out earlyWashington Spirit.They’ve been playing without Andi Sullivan, Casey Krueger and Ashley Hatch – all on maternity leave. Trinity Rodman has been battling injuries all year. Croix Bethune sat out the season finale. The Spirit have shown no reluctance to spend money on players, but that doesn’t help if the players aren’t actually playing. When Louisville last played in Washington, the Spirit needed a goal in the 10th minute of stoppage time to salvage a draw.ThePortland Thornshaven’t figured out San Diego this season with two 1-1 draws, both rescued via late equalizers from Portland. If the Thorns want to advance, they’ll need to prevent goals from one of the most dynamic offenses in the league in the Wave who have a multi-pronged attack.JFIn nightmarish déjà vu from last season, theWashington Spirithave struggled with injuries all year. On Decision Day, only three field players were available off the bench, and even though several scratches were precautionary, it remains to be seen if Adrián González’s side can get healthy and establish momentum. The Spirit’s quarter-final opponents, Racing Louisville, are on a tear; they haven’t lost a match since September, and have been causing problems for big teams all year. At their best, the Spirit are firmly the second-best team in the league, but if they can’t overcome their health issues, I wouldn’t be surprised if they falter.ASPlayer to watchOlivia Moultrie.She’s no longer the best teenager in NWSL because she is, at long last, no longer a teenager. The fifth-year Thorns midfielder has celebrated turning 20 in style, scoring four goals in the last four regular-season games. She led the NWSL in shot-creating actions per 90 minutes with 5.5, according to Opta/FBref.com.BDKayla Sharplesis a defensive stalwart on the backline for the Current. Her play was crucial to the Current’s record-breaking 16 clean sheets and she was one of two field players to eclipse 2,000 minutes on a team that had the luxury of resting their starters once they clinched the Shield.JFGift Mondayis the Spirit’s leading scorer on the year with eight goals, including a hat-trick against Houston on 28 September. She finished the regular season fourth-best in the league for shots on target per 90 minutes. The Nigerian attacker plays with a delicate fluidity that can stymie the best defenses, and she’ll be key to bolstering the injury-addled Spirit.ASSemi-finalistsKansas City, Seattle, Louisville, Portland.BDKansas City, Orlando, Washington, San Diego.JFKansas City, Orlando, Washington, Portland.ASNWSL ChampionshipKansas City 5-2 Portland.The gulf between the Current and the rest of the league is just that great, and they’re likely to come out anything but tentative in the final.BDKansas City 2-0 Washington.The Current have been too dominant and too consistent to pick against here. Even with a late-season injury to Chawinga jeopardizing her availability, look for Kansas City to pull off the Shield-Championship double against a Washington Spirit side that, despite the injuries, have the ability to give them difficulty after pushing them to a rare draw at home this season. Still I expect KC.JFKasnsas City 3-1 Washington.Assuming the Spirit can field their A-team, they’ll make it to the finals, but Kansas City are just too dominant to beat. The Current put up all kinds of records in their Shield-winning season, and Vlatko Andonovski’s side is, front-to-back, better than everyone else. They’ll take the final, and the inferior masses will have to try again next year.ASExplore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rioux, a 19-year-old redshirt freshman from Canada and the world’s tallest teenager, drew so much attention from the Ospreys that he didn’t even touch the ball.Is 7ft 9in teenager Olivier Rioux too tall for basketball?Read more“It felt great,” Rioux said. “The support from everybody was amazing, even on the bench and even the fans. I think everybody supported me. I’m very grateful.”When asked about making history, Rioux quipped: “It’s another day, I guess.”Rioux made everyone in attendance smile. Even North Florida forward Trey Cady smirked when he measured himself against Rioux. Cady was giving up more than a foot in the matchup.“There’s people yelling at me at halftime about playing him,” Golden said. “I’m like, ‘Listen, it will happen. The time will come.’”Rioux is two inches (five centimeters) taller than former NBA giants Gheorghe Muresan and Manute Bol, and three inches taller than popular big men Yao Ming, Tacko Fall and Shawn Bradley. He already owned a spot in the Guinness record book when he signed with Florida in 2024.Golden gave Rioux the option of playing sparingly last season or taking a redshirt season and working on his game. Riouxchose the latter. Nonetheless, he was a walking viral video, from riding his bike on campus, to ducking under every doorway, to cutting down nets while standing flat-footedduring Florida’s NCAA Tournament run.“He’s put in a lot of great work,” Golden said. “To his credit, he’s kept a great attitude without getting a lot of reward in terms of playing time and opportunity.”Golden had made it clear that Rioux would only play late in blowouts, the result of having all four frontcourt players returning. But Olivier doubled down on wanting to be at Florida and welcomed the challenge of playing against Alex Condon, Thomas Haugh, Rueben Chinyelu, and Micah Handlogten in practice and behind them in games.“I talked to the guys at halftime when we’re up 24 and I expressed to them the importance of getting off to a really good start so we can get some of the younger guys and some of the guys from down on the bench an opportunity to play and to get some rip,” Golden said. “Obviously the game was in our control and thought it would be a good opportunity to get him out there and get his first college experience, and I think he was pretty excited.“It was pretty neat for him to finally see the floor.”View image in fullscreenOlivier Rioux pictured last year.Photograph: John Raoux/APFans delivered the loudest ovation of the game – second only to Florida unveiling their championship banner during pregame introductions – when Golden motioned to Rioux at the end of the bench. Rioux pulled off his long-sleeved T-shirt and hustled to the scorer’s table to check in.Teammates and coaches celebrated wildly, and fans screamed every time the ball got near Rioux. He’ll have to wait until his next outing to actually touch it.“So much fun,” Handlogten said. “When he was checking into the game, I kind of stopped him and I was like, ’Play with confidence. You’ve worked your butt off for two years now to get to this spot. Now’s your moment. This is your time to shine.“To see him out there running up and down the court with a little smile on his face, it was really good to see.”Explore more on these topicsCollege basketballBasketballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Germany international’s difficult start in the Premier League – where he is yet to score or assist before Sunday’s visit to Manchester City – prompted a withering assessment by Wenger before the visit of Real.Wenger claimed on beIN Sports: “When Wirtz had the choice between going to Bayern Munich orLiverpool, he said to Liverpool: ‘I come to you if I play No 10. I do not want to play wide.’ Liverpool, to get him, they say OK. They started him and they destroyed their midfield, which was [Ryan] Gravenberch, [Alexis] Mac Allister, [Dominik] Szoboszlai. To play Wirtz, they took Szoboszlai out. What have they done? They have gone back to their midfield of last year.”More in common: how Sheikh Mansour is linked to Liverpool’s ownerRead moreWenger’s last point is correct, with last season’s title-winning midfield restored for victories over Aston Villa and the current leaders of La Liga. Liverpool’s performances were markedly improved and they kept a clean sheet in both games, after failing to keep one in the previous 10 matches. Slot, however, believes a better understanding between teammates is key to the overall development and not simply the position that Wirtz plays.“Everyone has a right to his own opinion,” said the Liverpool head coach on Wenger. “We have five or six very good midfielders who can all play together but they need to play more together to get the best out of every single player. Florian needs time to adapt to his teammates and teammates need time to adapt to him. Now he played off the left but I can tell you, if it is not now it is tomorrow, he will have great performances as a midfielder for Liverpool as well.”City were keen on signing Wirtz at the start of the summer transfer window but claim to have been put off by the financial package involved to bring him from Bayer Leverkusen. Wirtz’s camp, meanwhile, suggested he cooled on City owing to doubts over Pep Guardiola’s long-term future at the club. Slot, who hopes to have Alexander Isak available after almost three weeks out with a groin problem, insists Wirtz can become a dominant figure in the Premier League, as a No 10 or an inverted winger.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak has returned to Liverpool training after a groin niggle.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA“He definitely has the talent for it, but it’s not only about one player,” Slot added. “It’s also about the team you are playing in. What I can say about Florian is that since Xabi Alonso came in [at Leverkusen] he was mainly used in a 3-4-3 system as an inverted winger, where before that he mainly played as a 10. In the national team he plays as an inverted winger as well.“For me the only challenge I have is making sure he gets in those positions, as an inverted winger or as a 10, in and around the 18-yard box where his teammates need to find him with the right timing, because then he will always produce special things. He does this for the national team, he did it for Leverkusen and he’s already done that for us as well.”Slot admits he has changed the Liverpool team more than he would have wished this season and, unusually for him, became agitated when explaining how injuries to Mac Allister, Conor Bradley, Jeremie Frimpong and Isak gave him no alternative.“There have been obvious reasons why we’ve had to change more than I would like,” he said. “Mac Allister as an example – if you miss out on pre-season then you’re not ready to play three games in seven days. If you do, you will get injuries.“I can show multiple examples to you – Alex [Isak] is one, by the way. It’s so obvious for me and I’m a bit like, you can maybe feel it: ‘Jesus, why don’t you see these things? Why are you talking about me changing?’ when it’s so obvious why.“I’m known as being a manager who prefers not to change, but I couldn’t do anything different to what I did. Then, of course, we brought new players in and they have to adapt. You know what I want to say now? I want to talk about the last game when I saw a dive which 100% should have been a second yellow [for Vinícius Júnior].

Another and it would have started to look vindictive from Thomas Tuchel, who is far too wily not to know that winning the World Cup is probably going to require help fromJude Bellingham, even if it is also on the midfielder to fit into the tactical structures and squad hierarchies required with England now that he is back in Tuchel’s warm embrace.The manager wants Bellingham’s edge, his fire, but it is about using it in the right way. Individual quality matters butEnglandknow from bitter experience that there is a price to pay when celebrity takes over. Still, a point has been made.Bellingham and Foden earn England recalls as Wharton and Scott also pickedRead moreBellingham had much to ponder after being left out of last month’s squad. He watched England secure their spot at next summer’s World Cup without him. He watched Morgan Rogers excel as a counterpressing No 10. He heard Tuchel talk about loving the group’s energy and values. Inevitably, Bellingham has responded in champion style, scoring crucial goals for Real Madridagainst Barcelonaand Juventus. He had to be picked; another omission would have left his World Cup hopes hanging by a thread.The hope is that Tuchel will have a Bellingham focused on intimidating opponents rather than teammates. After all, on a pure footballing level, there is no value to picking a fight with one of the best players in the world. The best outcome is that Bellingham’s time on the sidelines has shown him that an international career is a precious, precarious thing. Tuchel, for his part, can now throw a protective shield around the 22-year-old after proving that he is not afraid to make big calls.“There is no problem with him, there is no problem with the character,” the German said. “Jude just has the edge. You need a certain edge to reach the heights that he reached. We all need to help him and create an environment which he can [have] this edge towards opponents and towards the goals we are building as a team.”Bellingham dominated much of the focus at Tuchel’s squad announcement for this month’s dead-rubber qualifiers against Serbia and Albania. Who else? Well, how about Phil Foden? Here is another prodigious No 10 in need of love and guidance. Foden has not played for England since March and has struggled to hit the heights this year but Tuchel could not ignore the 25-year-old after his performance inManchester City’s win against Borussia Dortmundthis week.View image in fullscreen‘There is no problem with the character – Jude just has the edge you need,’ said Thomas Tuchel of Bellingham.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/ReutersThe question, though, is how to use the various creators at England’s disposal. Rogers and Eberechi Eze deserve their spots and there will be a strong case to pick Cole Palmer once he recovers from a persistent groin problem. Would taking five No 10s to the World Cup be too many? Gareth Southgate never found the right blend at Euro 2024. He compromised by squeezing Foden and Bellingham into the same XI, cramping Harry Kane’s style in the process.It is hard to see Tuchel doing similar if it hurts the attacking balance. There is room for one No 10, with speedy wingers on the flanks. Clarity helps. Bellingham is in as a No 10. Bournemouth’s Alex Scott, called up for the first time, is a No 8 and the recalled Adam Wharton will compete with Elliot Anderson as a No 6. There will also be no wide role for Foden, who has to be central. Tuchel wants him close to Kane. “It does not make sense to tell Phil: ‘We want you on the pitch but there’s no space on your best position, can you play left wing? Can you play right wing?’” he said. “Phil will play in the No 9-10ish position, in the middle of the pitch. I have this fantasy about him for a long time. I think it suits him the most.”Tuchel agreed there are times when Foden has not looked himself in an England shirt. “You feel almost like, ‘Does he really enjoy it?’ And a player like him who has this childish joy to play football, then obviously something is not right, be it the position, the environment, I don’t know.“I think he is also so used to playing for Man City in a certain structure, to have a clear task. I think he profits a lot from clarity. Where do you want me to be? In which positions should I turn? Where am I supposed to accelerate the match? Where do I have to defend?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He said he has a longlist of 60 players. Morgan Gibbs-White, Myles Lewis-Skelly, James Trafford and Ruben Loftus-Cheek have dropped out. Nico O’Reilly is rewarded for his fine form for City at left-back. Intrigue abounds.2:30'We're delighted to have them back': Tuchel recalls Bellingham and Foden to England squad – videoThe omission of Ollie Watkins means there is no direct replacement for Kane in this squad. Fascinatingly, Tuchel hinted at using Foden as a false 9 against Serbia or Albania. Anthony Gordon, Marcus Rashford, Bellingham and Jarrod Bowen are other options should Kane be unavailable. With qualification secured this is a moment for a little experimentation.Meanwhile, it is also a moment to get Kane’s relationship with Bellingham going. It is remarkable that you have to go back to the latter setting up the captain to score ina friendly win against Scotlandin September 2023 to find the one and only time in 35 games for England when the duo combined for a goal. Tuchel will know that Kane and Bellingham only passed to each other once during England’s draws with Denmark and Slovenia at the Euros. The connection is missing.“This is where at some point it becomes the responsibility of the players,” Tuchel said. He is not afraid to deliver home truths. There is still a sense of Bellingham being on trial. He cannot even be guaranteed to start against Serbia and Albania. Tuchel wants Bellingham onside but he will be watching him carefully. Leave the ego at the door. It will make a very strong England team an even better one.Explore more on these topicsEnglandJude BellinghamThomas TuchelanalysisShareReuse this content"

That has brought inevitable pressure on to the 22-year-old’s shoulders with Amorim revealing that while he is relaxed about the situation, the player himself is not. “I understand how things are in football, and he’s going to struggle,” said the head coach. “He has no experience here, and when everyone says that you are the next big thing, you hear that. If you don’t perform every week, you are going to hear from club legends, from pundits, the media, and sometimes they are right.Leny Yoro: ‘Manchester United cannot build something with bad energy or bad characters’Read more“The ability to understand that this is normal and maintain your confidence is really hard for a kid, and especially for a kid that wants to control everything. He is not going to control everything.” It is understood that Sesko is meticulous regarding his preparation, arriving at the training ground at 8am and often leaving as late as 4pm.After last weekend’s2-2 drawat Nottingham Forest, Gary Neville claimed that Sesko was “miles off it”. Amorim was asked if these type of comments affect players. “Nobody likes to hear [that],” he said. “[Sesko has] struggled a little bit so let’s embrace that.“It’s not personal – that’s what I try to explain to the players. It’s an opinion that [could] change in a few weeks. What is true today, in three weeks could be different. My advice to Ben is you are going to get used to [hearing such opinions] and then it’s going to be natural – be like your Monday here. So we are going to help and protect Ben because he works so hard and wants to succeed.”Amorim went on to suggest that Bruno Fernandes may have to accept being rested next season if United again have European football. “We have one game per week so I’m not thinking about rotation. In the future – yes, [this] is something Bruno needs to understand,” said Amorim. “If you want to win every game and [have] European games, [I am] going to rotate. So for Bruno to put in his head that maybe next year he’s going to be in rotation.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asked about the midfielder’s future, Amorim referred to Harry Maguire, who is in an identical contract situation. “We don’t know what is going to happen,” he said. “Harry Maguire – he has the same problem.

As soon as the referee pointed to the spot at Slavia Prague on Tuesday, Arsenal’s goalkeeper sprinted to the touchline to confer with the coach Iñaki Caña in a routine that began when the pair first worked together at Brentford. No matter that Arsenal were cruising at 3-0 up with five minutes remaining and on their wayto a 10th straight victory– Raya was on the verge of creating history if he could save the penalty and keep the team’s eighth successive clean sheet.In the end, the video assistant referee came to Arsenal’s rescue and the penalty was overturned, although Raya did have to save a simple effort from Youssoupha Mbodji in injury time from Slavia’s only shot on target. It was only the seventh save he has made in four Champions League games, in which he has yet to concede a goal. Incredibly, since Nick Woltemade scored past Raya for Newcastle on 28 September,Arsenalhave conceded only 12 shots on target in 12 hours and 56 minutes on their way to equalling a club clean-sheets record established over two seasons in 1903 when they were a team from south London playing in the old Second Division.Max Dowman leads charge for ever younger stars at Arsenal and beyondRead moreRaya’s 50th Arsenal clean sheet in his 110 games since joining from Brentford in 2023 took him past the record holder from that side, Jimmy Ashcroft, and the joke doing the rounds among fans has been that the Spaniard could start working from home and still keep a clean sheet. It was also suggested after the 4-0 thrashing of Atlético Madrid last month that he might consider bringing along a book to keep him occupied.“No, you never know,” Raya said with a smile. “You never know when the other team is going to have a chance. You have to be alert, no matter how we’re playing or how we play. I have to be alert 90, 100 minutes every game.”Mikel Arteta has no concerns in that regard. “It’s the way he is naturally, the way he trains every single day and the way he anticipates things,” Arsenal’s manager said in the buildup to Saturday’s game at Sunderland. “David is exceptional at that.”View image in fullscreenDavid Raya has the best save success rate in the Premier League this season.Photograph: Lee Durkin/Action Plus/ShutterstockRaya’s interactions with Caña, who ran his own goalkeeping academy in Barcelona before joining Brentford in 2018, are key to that concentration process. Raya, who has the best save success rate in the Premier League at 84.2% from 19 shots, often consults the 50-year-old during breaks in play to get the perspective of a coach who moved to Arsenal when Arteta took over in December 2019.Raya has described his role as “the first attacker and the last defender” and said in aninterview with Brentfordin 2023: “My view from the back is completely different to watching the game from the side of the pitch. From the side you see more. It’s hard for me to speak with those on the touchline because I’m far away, so I use every opportunity I can get. I’ll have ideas in my head. Shall we try this, shall we try that? I want to help the team as much as possible in every way.”Compared with other recent outings, Raya was far busier in the first half-hour against Slavia, dealing with crosses and a shot that turned out to be offside, as the Czech champions forced Arsenal back without seriously threatening his goal. As Arsenal began to establish dominance in midfield and pushed further up the pitch, his mobility and distribution came into their own.According to Opta, the 30-year-old has registered the highest speed of any goalkeeper in the Champions League this season at 31.34km/h and ranks second in the Premier League at 30.14km/h, just behind Dean Henderson of Crystal Palace at 30.27km/h. This gives Raya an advantage when he decides to come out of his area, and his 273 touches in his seven-game run of clean sheets (he was rested for the eighth game, a Carabao Cup tie) illustrate that he does that regularly. There have even been two in the opposition half. One on the left touchline against Atlético almost led to a goal after he lost possession to Giuliano Simeone.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has put that down to a two-hour heart-to-heart with Caña after conceding three goals against Luton in December 2023, which led Raya to establish a new morning routine that includes getting up earlier and having an ice bath. The 4-3 victory at Kenilworth Road was the last time Arsenal let in three goals – a run of 103 games surpassed among Premier League clubs only by José Mourinho’s Manchester United (107).There has also been greater focus from Raya on becoming more aggressive in claiming crosses. “Iñaki was one of the reasons behind that,” Raya, who left Spain as a teenager and cut his teeth playing in the National League for Southport on loan from Blackburn,told Arsenal’s websiterecently. “I was more of a reactive goalkeeper before, but now I see the difference between being reactive – when you wait to make the save – or proactive – when you can stop the attacks happening. You do that either by being high up, or coming off your line for crosses, not trying to stay on your line and make wonder-saves.”Arsenal are England’s first top-flight team for more than a century to win eight successive matches without conceding in all competitions but face an in-form Sunderland. Raya, who has the date of his Premier League debut for Brentford – a 2-0 win over Arsenal – tattooed on his neck in recognition of his long journey to the top, will not be taking anything for granted.Explore more on these topicsArsenalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At first glance it could be mistaken as evidence of his hands-on approach at Coventry training, collateral damage from partaking in those snappy rondos. The reality is a world away from frontline coaching. “I twisted it playing with the kids in Hyde Park on a Sunday,” he says, breaking into a broad smile.It is Lampard down to a T. As a youngster he was ticked off by his late mother, Patricia, for wearing football boots to bed and once spent a weekend in Bournemouth at his uncle Harry Redknapp’s housebreaking in a pair of moulds. Lampard has always been immersed in the game, from joining Heath Park boys’ club and fulfilling his dream of pulling on a West Ham shirt to cementing his place as one of England’s greatest midfielders across 13 years and countless trophies at Chelsea. Those days have gone – Coventry represents his fourth club as a manager – but the 47-year-old still believes in being in the thick of things.“The people I aspired to be when I started to do this and went to watch different managers, the best ones were right in the middle of the training pitch, trying to get their message across there and then,” he says. “I went to watch Pep [Guardiola] for a few days because of my Man City connections, Eddie Howe, Thomas Frank. For me, the good ones, generally, are in the middle of everything. I think that’s the best way so I am active like that and I enjoy being that way. That’s how I’d want to be coached in this modern day. It’s good to interact with the players.”Joe Cole: ‘Anything which generates the money you get in football means the parasites come’Read moreLampard is engaging company, touching on everything from Coventry’s pacesetting start asChampionshipleaders to the evolution of Thomas Tuchel’s England and even Midsomer Murders. He is talking in a hospitality box overlooking the CBS Arena pitch, fresh from meeting participants from a dementia programme run by the club’s charity arm. It is one of the community projects across the English Football League’s 72 clubs that collectively engage with more than one million people a year and among those showcased across the afternoon at the ground to celebrate the EFL’s annual week of action. Coventry’s initiative resonates with Lampard whose grandmother Hilda was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease when he was a teenager.Quick GuideChampionship: Watford 1-1 Bristol CityShowRobins hit back to draw at WatfordGerhard Struber praised quick-thinking Scott Twine after his free-kick earned Bristol City a 1-1 draw at Watford in the Championship.Twine caught out home goalkeeper Egil Selvik in the 29th minute with a set piece from the edge of the box on the left that beat the Norwegian at his near post.That impressed the City manager Struber, as did Twine’s overall contribution.“Scott [has] outstanding technical power with his monster leg,” he said.“It helped us to score in this way but I like his energy at the moment – his work ethic on the field to invest everything.“You do not see it that often that players on this level work really hard against the ball but this was the key - players with high technical level were involved in our defensive pressing moments.”Marc Bola’s first Watford goal gave the Hornets a sixth-minute lead, with captain Imran Louza setting him up with a 70-yard pass from his own half.That allowed Bola to sprint in behind the City defence, control the ball with an impressive first touch and slot past the Robins goalkeeper Radek Vitek.The Watford manager Javi Gracia said: “The pass was sensational, the control and finalising was very good - it was a very good goal.”The point prevented City, who were without a number of players because of injury, from losing three times in six days following defeats against Stoke and Blackburn.“It was a really big point,” Struber added. “In our situation with all the players who are not available, the boys were outstanding together. The bounce back was on a really good level.\"PA MediaPhotograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“As these things are, it was very quick. I would see lots of Nanny Hilda and she would always have the tea made, the cakes and sandwiches ready. She lived in east London, not far from Upton Park, and when you’re that bit younger you don’t recognise all the signs, but it started with some memory loss and it became much more severe. It was quite scary as a family to deal with. But many, many families are coping with it and we have to help as much as we can. The positive faces I saw a moment ago show how much we can do to support.”Coventry are the highest scorers in the top four tiers of English football; remarkably, their tally of 39 goals, courtesy of 10 scorers, has exceeded their total for the 2016-17 season, when the club were relegated to League Two, and is at least double the number mustered by all but four of their division rivals. After a couple of near misses, there is renewed optimism about returning to the Premier League for the first time since relegation in 2001. AfterTuesday’s win against Sheffield United, Coventry have more points after 14 matches than four of the six automatically promoted teams had at the same stage in the past three campaigns, including Leeds and Burnley last season.This Saturday brings a trip to second-placed Stoke, managed by Mark Robins, Lampard’s predecessor who dragged the club from League Two to within touching distance of the Premier League. It is a quirky timing; Friday marks a year since Robins was sacked with the club 17th, outside the relegation zone on goal difference. This month marks Lampard’s first anniversary in charge and he, too, went close to guiding Coventry to the top flight last season, losing to Sunderland in the playoff semi-finals. On his first day he gathered the staff into the gym, including chefs and cleaners, and told the players they were better than the table suggested. Lampard has revitalised the place.View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard puts an arm around Haji Wright, one of Coventry’s 10 goalscorers this season.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWhat is the most discernible difference between the team now and the one he inherited? “Well, the team now starts to feel like a team that I want my team to look like … that’s absolutely no disrespect to what went on before because the [previous] manager had the most incredible success. But when I came in you could feel the confidence was down, when you looked at the team I don’t think there was a clear identity and that can happen without confidence. I’ve lost my job as well, so I understand what can happen. My job was to go: ‘Where can we get better?’ We have tried to create a team with real speed and energy. We want to be a very positive team in how we win the ball back and attack. At the moment I see a lot of things I like and hopefully the fans are enjoying it.”At his unveiling Lampard was peppered with questions about why he wants to work in such a volatile industry, rather than be a pundit or practise his golf swing. “I take slight offence to that line of questioning – ‘why do you do this?’ – because I’m presuming money’s involved. I am quite driven so I do want to prove everybody wrong all the time, I think it’s a good driving force. I try not to rely on it because if you do you’ll be the best manager one week, the worst manager the next week. That’s pretty much the story.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has felt scrutiny throughout his career, from the infamous moment when Redknapp defended selecting his nephew at a West Ham fans’ forum in 1996. Lampard won 106 caps, representing England at four major tournaments, including three World Cups, when the narrative was often that anything but victory was failure. “‘The golden generation should absolutely have won a tournament’ … well, no, we had to go against Spain, France and Germany and it wasn’t easy. And it won’t be next summer. At the same time I can imagine the work is very good, we have got good talent in the squad; it’s exciting and I hope they do very well.” Has he tired of the talk of the so-called golden generation? “Yeah, a little bit. It’s old news and people sensationalise it. I look back very fondly on my England career but we didn’t win and that’s a fact.”So, what has Lampard made of England under Tuchel, who has been happy to leave out big names? “You can see the direction he wants to take them, where there is a real togetherness about the team, the style, and I think it’s been positive. My generation gets spoken about a lot but it was a different time, era and group. With my group at Coventry, the most important thing for us is that we’re all together and the players professionally get on well and they know the direction we’re going and they all respect each other.”Balance emerges as a theme. He commutes from the family home in London and Redknapp is usually first to call after matches, catching Lampard on the M40. Other times he turns to music or podcasts to wile away the journey. He added The Enemy – the Coventry band who before Tuesday’s win performed We’ll Live and Die in These Towns, a song adopted as the club’s pre-match anthem – to his playlist and in the summer saw Oasis three times at Wembley. “I remember their [first] albums coming out, I was 17, 18, and I was very ready for that at the time,” he says, smiling. “It was a sweet spot for my era.”View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard with participants at the EFL’s annual week of action event.Photograph: Ryan Browne/ShutterstockDoes he tend to steer clear of sport when it comes to podcasts? “I listened toSteven Bartlett with Jürgen Kloppthe other day and that was very interesting. But, yeah, generally I like to go away from it. I like politics or crime. Murder mysteries. I listen to Dateline. I’ve got that kind of weird fascination with these things: how do these things get solved?”Overworking can be glamorised and Lampard confesses he is a “workaholic” but recognises the value of time with his seven-year-old daughter, Patricia, and four-year-old son, Freddie. “It just gives me a bit of a softener,” he says. “I have four children: my eldest daughters are at university, one in Scotland, one in London, and my younger ones keep me busy, so I enjoy being at home with them and my wife. That’s what I love doing. If I get a day off, I’m very, very happy to be doing the basics of life, that’s the perfect switch-off.”Explore more on these topicsFrank LampardCoventry CityChampionshipinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He was cleared of a further six counts.The first posts made by Barton targeted the female football pundits Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko after the two women had worked on the coverage of a 17 January 2024 FA Cup tie between Everton and Crystal Palace.Barton, a longtime critic of female involvement in men’s football, made disparaging remarks about the women’s punditry of the fixture and compared them to notorious serial killers, calling them the “Fred and Rose West of football commentary”. He went on to superimpose the faces of the two women on to a photograph of the murderers. Ward told the court on Tuesday that these posts left her feeling “physically scared”.He also posted that Aluko was in the “Joseph Stalin/Pol Pot category” as she had “murdered hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of football fans’ ears”, before alleging that she was only “there to tick boxes”, adding: “DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] is a load of shit. Affirmative action. All off the back of the BLM/George Floyd nonsense.”Barton’s attack on the two women led to the broadcaster Jeremy Vine attempting to intervene, telling the court on Wednesday he had been “quite shocked by what Mr Barton had said about two very respected commentators”, and had asked if he was “dealing with a brain injury here?”Barton responded by calling Vine a “bike nonce”, asking him if he had “been on Epstein Island” and if he was “going to be on these flight logs”, before telling him he might as well “own up now because I’d phone the police if I saw you near a primary school on ya bike”. He then posted an image of Vine with the caption: “If you see this fella by a primary school call 999.”Vine told the court he took these allegations seriously and felt “physically unsafe” because of them, worried that Barton’s “like-minded” followers could interpret them as real, saying: “If people want to find out where you live, they can.” Vine also said that as a result of Barton’s posts: “I took some advice about my security; I varied my movements. I do believe these messages put me in danger, in physical danger.”Barton alleged he was the victim of “political prosecution” and downplayed the posts as “crude banter” and “a spat between celebrities online” when cross-examined on Thursday.He said: “This was the state, in my opinion, trying to squeeze me into the ground. This is a state prosecution, I believe, for whatever their agendas are in pushing on people.”Barton said he did not intend to actually call Vine a paedophile and that his posts directed towards the broadcaster were “a wind-up” and “a bad, dark, juvenile joke”.At one point during cross examination, the prosecutor Peter Wright KC called Barton’s explanations “nonsense”, to which the former player responded by asking: “Are you calling me a nonce?” Wright in turn responded: “No, nonsense.”Barton went on to say he had not tried to “cause distress or anxiety or risk his life or his daughters’ lives”, adding: “I don’t want people to fear for their lives. I’m a dad.”In a statement after the hearing, Aluko said: “Social media is a cesspit where too many people feel they can say things to others they wouldn’t dream of saying in real life under the guise of freedom of speech.“This is a reminder that actions online do not come without consequences,.”“The messages directed at me, Lucy Ward and Jeremy Vine by Joey Barton were deeply distressing and had a real damaging impact on my life and career. I am glad that justice has been served.”Barton is due to be sentenced on 8 December, with his bail conditions prohibiting him from mentioning the three victims in any way before then.Explore more on these topicsJoey BartonCrimeSocial mediaDigital mediaJeremy VinenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s been positive and I’m just so proud of myself for making these changes. It’s just been a mad couple of months but the best couple of months and I just feel like I can really push on now and go somewhere new as a player and that’s what I want to do. I want to get all the experiences I can in these environments and really push myself to the max.”Agyemang injury for England deflates Bronze’s birthday celebrations against MatildasRead moreSitting on a sofa in the main canteen at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground, the 26-year-old left-back speaks with the energy of someone appreciative of a twist in a tale she maybe thought would not come.When the nearby door swings open, Clare Wheatley walks in and Arsenal’s director of women’s football makes a beeline for Hinds, who she hasn’t seen since the defender’s England adventures last month. “Enjoy it,” a beaming Wheatley says. “I’m so pleased for you, Taylor, what a story, you couldn’t write it.”Hinds has slotted in well at Arsenal, featuring seven times, many of her appearances from the bench, and the reward has been her England call-up. Her inclusion in Sarina Wiegman’s squad for friendlies against Brazil and Australia was a surprise to many. Hinds opted to represent Jamaica last year, featuring in a friendly against France seven years after she played her final game for England’s Under-19s.The call-up was “unexpected,” says Hinds, who also played for England’s Under-17s. “I have dual heritage, which I’m obviously really proud of, but growing up going through the England pathway meant that something I’d always dreamed of was to play for England. I have nothing but respect for Jamaica, the country is still a big part of who I am and a part of my family and my identity. My family were very proud of me representing Jamaica but they were also very proud of me getting my England call-up and making my debut.”View image in fullscreenTaylor Hinds enjoyed Aggie Beever-Jones’s goal against Australia in last month’s friendly.Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty ImagesWiegman gave Hinds time to mull over a tough decision. For many it will be hard to understand how difficult it must be to choose between two integral parts of yourself in this way.“I had a great conversation with Sarina and she allowed me time and space to think about the decision because she knows that I have love and pride for both countries,” Hinds says. “That’s what people don’t realise, that I am proud of both countries. Hopefully everyone can respect what is a hugely personal decision … [Wiegman] understood my situation and she respected it fully.”Hinds was on the bench against Brazil but started the 3-0 defeat of Australia and impressed. How has she found her experiences with Wiegman and Arsenal’s head coach, Renée Slegers?“There’s a few similarities there,” she says. “They’re quite honest and direct and I’ve always loved that, having that honest relationship with a manager. There were new [England] staff in too but they were new for everyone in the team as well, and it was great because we got to spend some time getting to know them a bit off the pitch.”Hinds was playing 90 minutes every week for Liverpool, so battling for a place at Arsenal has presented a challenge. “This is the type of team that I want to be in,” she says. “I have the utmost respect for Liverpool for everything they’ve done for me over the five years. There’s a little part of me that’s always going to love Liverpool. So many of my friends are still up there, scousers are just one of a kind too, and I definitely miss that side of it, the people, but I’m also loving it here and I’m really thriving and happy.“The difference is just the standard, the intensity and the quality. Everything’s so fast-paced and training every day is like playing in a game every day. That’s what you want: you want to train how you play and here I get to do that with world-class players and learn from them.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Embracing the inspiration she can be to young Black girls is hugely important to her.‘There’s this buzz of excitement’: Emily Fox on USWNT and Arsenal ambitionsRead more“It’s only in the past few years that I really realised the role I can play, for young Black girls especially. Everyone inspires people in their own way. I may just inspire within the football community or the Black football community, and that’s fine. As long as I’m visible and I’m able to inspire even one person that’s enough and can go a long way.”She is encouraged by the number of Black fans in the stands at the Emirates for women’s games, including families. A crowd of more than 55,000 is expected on Saturday at a must-win game for Arsenal, who are fifth, five points behind Chelsea, the leaders.“We’ve not had the start we wanted in the WSL, which has obviously been frustrating, but the game against Leicester at the weekend [a 4-1 win] has given us some good momentum,” Hinds says. “Of course it’s going to be a tough game and a battle. Everyone lives for a derby – these games are exactly why we play football. We have respect for Chelsea but we also want to beat them.”Explore more on these topicsArsenal WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballinterviewsShareReuse this content"

The Canadian company Premier Tech, in a statement issued on Friday, said that it had decided to “step down as co-title sponsor of the team, taking effect immediately”.“Although we took notice of the team’s decision to change its name for the 2026 season,” the statement said, “the core reason for Premier Tech to sponsor the team has been overshadowed to a point where it has become untenable for us to continue as a sponsor.”Despite the latest setback, the team are understood to be forging ahead with plans for the 2026 season, after stating in September that a rebrand was “essential to securing the future of the team”.IPT was plunged into crisis by mass protests against the team’s presence during September’s Vuelta a España, which culminated in thecancellation of the final stageof the three-week race in Madrid.In the aftermath, further protests against Israel’s war in Gaza were threatened at other races around Europe and at the Grand Départ of next year’s Tour de France, in Barcelona, while rival teams considered boycotting races at which IPT was present. Although Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had praised the team for not “giving in to hate” after the numerous pro-Palestine protests at the Vuelta, IPT subsequently announced that it was “moving away from its Israeli identity”.The team also withdrew from a series of autumnal one-day races for security reasons, while sponsors, including Premier Tech and Factor Bikes, publicly called for changes to the team’s identity. The squad’s leading performer, the Canadian rider Derek Gee, fourth overall in this year’s Giro d’Italia, also announced that he was cancelling his contract due to what he described as “serious concerns” and added that “certain issues simply made my continuation at the team untenable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That arrangement gave a short-term feel to the role, but the German hashit his stride in recent monthsand has said managing England has rejuvenated him after draining spells at Bayern Munich and Chelsea.Tuchel wants Bellingham’s fire so long as England’s ace leaves his ego at door | Jacob SteinbergRead moreSpeaking after announcing his squad for the upcoming games against Serbia and Albania, Tuchel said extending his deal was “a possibility” but stressed that he was relaxed about holding talks before the World Cup. There is the precedent of Fabio Capello convincing the FA to give him a new contract before the 2010 World Cup only forEnglandto have a disastrous tournament and go out to Germany in the last 16.Tuchel, who has already secured his team’s World Cup spot, is keen to avoid such distractions. Equally, he was clear that whether he deserves an extension should not be judged solely on whether he makes England’s world champions for the first time since 1966.“It will be a huge distraction if I give you a certain level that is a minimum demand to myself,” he said. “I have this in my head clearly. Maybe we can talk openly about it before the World Cup, because why not? Then there is another level to it. There is a certain state we have to reach that I demand from myself. Otherwise, it’s not good enough.“But I think we all understand that when it comes to knockout football it’s: ‘How do we go out?’ It’s different if we lose 3-0 in a round of 32 to a huge underdog and we completely underperform, or you lose with a red card in the _second minute for the goalkeeper and you go out and you put up a big fight in a quarter-final and you go out on penalties and play 120 minutes with 10 men.”View image in fullscreenHarry Kane (centre) leads the applause for the England fans after the 5-0 win in Latvia in October.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PATuchel added: “I am the first one to agree that titles matter and to agree that it’s about winning, winning, winning – and still feel the fans will understand if we go out with pride, if we go out with a top performance, if they were happy to support us. Or if it was like: ‘They could have done better and they were striking in training and they were drinking’ … Then they will clearly understand whether this is the right way to continue or not.”There was a clear sense that the nature of the job is working for Tuchel. “I know from many years in professional and club football what makes me happy and what brings the best out of me,” he said. “I feel re-energised and I love to work with the players and be close to the Premier League. I know also the level of support and trust that I have.Quick GuideEngland squad to face Serbia and AlbaniaShowSquad to play World Cup qualifiers at home to Serbia (Thursday 13 November) and away to Albania (Sunday 16 November)GoalkeepersDean Henderson (Crystal Palace), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Nick Pope (Newcastle).DefendersDan Burn (Newcastle), Marc Guéhi (Crystal Palace), Reece James (Chelsea), Ezri Konsa (Aston Villa), Nico O'Reilly (Manchester City), Jarell Quansah (Bayer Leverkusen), Djed Spence (Tottenham), John Stones (Manchester City).MidfieldersElliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest), Jude Bellingham (Real Madrid), Jordan Henderson (Brentford), Declan Rice (Arsenal), Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa), Alex Scott (Bournemouth), Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace).ForwardsJarrod Bowen (West Ham United), Eberechi Eze (Arsenal), Phil Foden (Manchester City), Anthony Gordon (Newcastle), Harry Kane (Bayern Munich), Marcus Rashford (Barcelona, on loan from Manchester United), Bukayo Saka (Arsenal).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I feel that and I know I need that to be the best version of myself. I’m very relaxed. I was the one to push for a short contract, to streamline it and go to the World Cup, because I was not fully aware of the job and what is needed and how I would feel in the job. Nothing has changed. The focus is the World Cup and the federation knows that I’m happy. They play a big part in me feeling good and re-energised.”Tuchel is especially enjoying the slower pace of international football. “I know where I am and I like where it’s going,” he said. “The best thing, the big tournament, is yet to come.”The former Chelsea manager revealed that his contract does not include any clauses that will be triggered by England’s performances at the World Cup. He would not rule out signing a new deal before the tournament but added that it is not a demand from his side.Explore more on these topicsEnglandThomas TuchelnewsShareReuse this content"

The FA said an independent regulatory commission found the allegations to be proven after Osmajic was charged with an “aggravated” breach of their rules over conduct, while the Montenegro forward denied the charges.“Preston North End are extremely disappointed at the decision made by an independent regulatory commission to sanction Milutin Osmajic and impose a nine-match suspension, following an incident which took place in a league fixture against Burnley on February 2025,” read a statement. “We note that the outcome was determined on the ‘Balance of Probabilities’ rather than one that is ‘Beyond Reasonable Doubt’.“We also note that the FA determined that this decision offers no moral judgement, was not premeditated nor any comment about his general character. Milutin has always pleaded his innocence of the charge and continues to do so. We continue to be fully supportive of our player.”Osmajic, signed by Preston from Cádiz in September 2023, has scored four goals in 11 league appearances for Preston this season. The 26-year-old has also been fined £21,000 and ordered to attend an education course.View image in fullscreenHannibal Mejbri reports what Milutin Osmajic was alleged to have said to him.Photograph: Paul Currie/Shutterstock“An independent regulatory commission has sanctioned Preston North End FC’s Milutin Osmajic for a proven breach of FA Rule E3,” read an FA statement. “It was alleged that the forward had breached FA Rule E3.1 by acting in an improper manner and/or using abusive and/or insulting words towards a Burnley FC player during their EFLChampionshipfixture on Saturday 15 February. It was also alleged that this matter constitutes an “Aggravated Breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3.2, as the words included a reference – whether express or implied – to colour and/or race.“Milutin Osmajic denied the charge against him, which the regulatory commission found to be proven, and it has imposed an immediate nine-match suspension, £21,000 fine and mandatory education course.

While the 54-year-old agrees with Sir Alex Ferguson that his success has somewhat depended on having outstanding players, Guardiola believes his own stellar qualities are behind his longevity and success.Pep Guardiola won 14 trophies at Barcelona, seven at Bayern Munich and 18 at Manchester City during his 17-year managerial career.“Dedication, passion, love – in that nobody beats me,” he said. “We have won incredible things in Barcelona, Bayern Munich and here. It is difficult to reach and if I start again I would not reach it, it is too much games. A few defeats in 1,000 games and hopefully on Sunday I hope we can continue.More in common: how Sheikh Mansour is linked to Liverpool’s ownerRead more“I completely agree with Sir Alex. It looks like I have false humility but this amount – every 10 games we win seven and will draw one or two – it can happen because you are in Barcelona, Munich and Manchester with the players I have.”OfLiverpool, Guardiola said: “If I had to choose one rival for this milestone, that would be the best one. Because I’ve been in this country longer than anywhere else. I was at Barcelona as a boy [and player] and Bayern were important [too], but Liverpool have been the biggest rival in this country. It could not be better, to be honest – the universe decides that.”Since the 2017-18 season, either City or Liverpool have won the title, and Guardiola believes this is now the domestic game’s fiercest rivalry. “We created this in the last decade, before it was [Manchester] United-Liverpool with [before] maybe Chelsea, Arsenal,” he said.Guardiola was asked who he thinks is football’s greatest manager. “There have been [great] managers throughout history. I can say I’ve been part of it because the numbers [show] this,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

2007 for passing information for rewardGreg WoodFri 7 Nov 2025 11.26 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 16.32 ESTShareThe former top Flat jockey Robert Winston, who made an unexpected and successful return to race-riding in Bahrain last week, has had his licence to ride in the country suspended and is believed to have returned to Britain while an investigation continues into the circumstances surrounding his departure.Winston, a former champion apprentice, was on course to be crowned champion jockey on the Flat in 2005 when he suffered serious injuries in a fall at Ayr, and while he has two Group One winners to his name – most recently aboard Librisa Breeze in the 2017 Champions Sprint at Ascot – he was also banned for a year in 2007 by the British Horseracing Authority’s independent disciplinary panel for passing information for reward.‘He’s a true legend’: what now for Frankie Dettori as racing’s biggest name leaves the stage?Read moreWinston initially announced his retirement from race-riding in 2019, citing problems maintaining his weight and the ongoing effects of injuries.He made a low-key return to action in the 2021 and 2022 seasons but had not ridden in Britain since March 2022 when he announced in mid-October that he had been granted a licence by the authorities in Bahrain ahead of the start of the country’s racing season on 31 October.Winston rode a double from two mounts on his return to the saddle last week but it has now emerged that his contract with trainer Paul Smith has been terminated and that his licence has been suspended.A spokesperson for the Bahrain Turf Club, quoted in the Racing Post on Friday, confirmed that “following an incident involving Mr Robert Winston, his licence was suspended” and added that the circumstances are “the subject of an ongoing investigation”.Colonel to take command over National fencesThe baton passes from one code to another in the space of just over an hour on Saturday afternoon as the Grand National fences

The normally composed half-court conductor had just been told by a reporter that he was the first Chicago Bull to record back-to-back triple doubles since Michael Jordan more than 30 years ago.The Australian’s starring role in the 24-point comeback against Philadelphia this week, when he gathered double-digit tallies in points, rebounds and assists – hence “triple” double – ended with an exclamation point.‘Never done that before’: Josh Giddey hits half-court buzzer-beater as Bulls stun LakersRead moreA lavish off-hand pass for the game-winning basket by his team-mate Nikola Vučević meant Giddey was atop both the game’s box score and its viral highlight. “Huh,” the 23-year-old replied to the reporter, shaking his head, as his distinctive mop of hair moved as one.Australian audiences got a thrill from spotting Luc Longley during The Last Dance, the 2020 documentary that helped a new generation discover the achievements of Jordan’s Bulls, even if producers largely overlooked the centre’s contribution as a vital member of that team. (Longley’s version of events was subsequentlycovered by the ABC.)There have been AustralianNBAsuccesses since, like Patty Mills, Andrew Bogut and Joe Ingles, who have either won championships or respect in one of the world’s most hyper-competitive athletic arenas. Matthew Dellavedova’s role in Cleveland’s 2016 title alongside LeBron James was as legendary as it was unlikely.Yet Longley’s place in basketball history playing alongside Jordan has always been a badge of honour for Australian hoops. Now, a grinning Giddey was alongside Jordan in the same sentence. “Nah, it’s cool,” he said. “I’m not going to sit here and lie about it and say it’s not cool.”View image in fullscreenJosh Giddey and Nikola Vucevic are enjoying a hot start to the NBA season with Chicago Bulls.Photograph: Michael Reaves/Getty ImagesScottie Pippen has described Jordan as selfish, but Giddey is not one to spend long dwelling on himself. “All the individual stuff comes as a byproduct of winning and being a very fun team to play with,” the Australian told the reporter.Giddey should know. He exploded into the NBA with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and was the youngest player to record a triple double early in 2022, less than three months after he turned 19 during his rookie season. But after Giddey started every game and played 31 minutes per contest in his second season, Oklahoma City’s coaching staff saw success in another direction.His minutes dropped to 25 per game the following season, and then 18 in the playoffs, as the Thunder surrounded lead guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander with shooters and athletic defenders. Unfortunately for the Australian, he had proven by that stage to be neither.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueGiddey has always been large for a guard, his size helping him compete physically in the lane and for rebounds. His playmaking, management of pace and passing have always been elite. But his inconsistent shot – especially off the dribble – reluctance to use his frame attacking the rim, and struggles to contain fast opponents on the perimeter were always seen as potentially critical limitations.There are just 30 NBA teams, and therefore as few players who get to be lead point guards. But only half that number get to be lead guards with winning records. The Bulls’ mediocrity last season, after they traded well-liked Alex Caruso for Giddey, threatened to force the Australian into a career riding the NBA pine if he could not be useful starting for a playoff contender.Giddey’s form did trend up in the back half of the season, but his protracted off-season contract extension showed Bulls’ general manager Artūras Karnišovas – like much of Chicago’s demanding fanbase – was still unconvinced of his value.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAustralia SportFree newsletterGet a daily roundup of the latest sports news, features and comment from our Australian sports deskEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many Bulls’ followers have admitted they were wrong about him on social media this week. Others went further. “Michael Josh Giddey Jordan. It’s over we winning three chips in a row,” one said on Instagram, below the video of the game-winner, in a comment liked almost 2,000 times.The Australian is averaging nearly a triple double with 23 points. His three-point shooting success rate is above league average and he is attacking the rim, getting to the free-throw line twice as often as he did last season.But most importantly he is helping his side win. The Bulls recorded their best start to a season since peak Jordan in 1996 and sit atop the Eastern Conference, one of only two teams – alongside Giddey’s old friends at the Thunder – with just a single loss.View image in fullscreenChicago Bulls guard Josh Giddey drives to the basket against Orlando Magic.Photograph: Phelan M Ebenhack/APJordan and Giddey have little in common, apart from the red and black singlet both have worn, as well as that obscure statistical achievement highlighted this week. To be clear, Giddey might be best described – as an awkwardly upright, team-focused, pass-first point guard and a suburban kid from Melbourne, Australia – as the anti-Jordan.Put the man known as Mike in any team and he would have been a star, such were his physical and mental attributes. Jordan is known as the most competitive athlete ever, brash and combative, and able to back it up in any contest.Giddey will never dunk from the free-throw line or transform the fortunes of a sporting goods manufacturer, but for Chicago fans – who have now waited 26 years for a seventh NBA title – it may be in his power to do something just as significant: help the Bulls win .The Australian knows, after his experience in Oklahoma City, he needs the faith of those around him. “I’m grateful I’ve got teammates and coaches who allow me to be in positions to be successful.”Explore more on these topicsNBASportblogChicago BullsBasketballAustralia sportUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There wasn’t much choice.”The duke, who conducted the interview wearing a Blue Jays cap, is in Canada for Remembrance Week events.“When you’re missing a lot of hair on top, and you’re sitting under floodlights, you’ll take any hat that’s available,” he joked.“Game five, game six, game seven, I was Blue Jays throughout. Now that I’ve admitted that, it’s going to be pretty hard for me to return back to Los Angeles.”Toronto ultimately lost out to the Dodgers in a seventh-game decider. The duke added he was “devastated” at the Blue Jays’ defeat.The royal pair moved to Los Angeles in 2020, after initially setting up home in Canada, and live in Montecito with their children Archie, six, and Lilibet, four.While Meghan wore a Dodgers cap and team colours during the series, she has previously shown her support for the Blue Jays, a nod to her former home city.The former actress lived in Toronto while filming the legal drama Suits, and she and Harry spent time together there during the early stages of their relationship.The duchess was photographed wearing a Blue Jays cap while attending a game in 2015.During his visit to Canada, Harry met a 101-year-old Canadian Second World War navy veteran and other former servicepeople ahead of Remembrance Day.The duke was all smiles as he watched veterans taking part in activities such as painting, ceramics and photography at the Sunnybrook Veterans Centre in Toronto.He viewed military helmets decorated by veterans to reflect their experiences of service and remembrance, and was pictured lending a hand with one man’s artwork.Among those the duke met was Brenda Reid, 101, who served at a women-run naval station in Nova Scotia during the Second World War and Harold Toth, 95, a Korean War veteran who enlisted with the Queen’s Own Rifles.When asked by Harry about their war experiences, Reid offered a playful warning about her fellow residents: “You can’t always believe the boys.”The meeting was part of his two-day visit to Toronto to meet veterans, members of the armed forces community and military charities to mark the “Remembrancetide” period which spans the two-week period leading up to Remembrance Sunday.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryLos Angeles DodgersToronto Blue JaysWorld SeriesBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not grumpy pensioners or vulnerable teenagers – it’s my generationFri 7 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 08.24 ESTShareIf in doubt, we used to talk about the weather. Or if not that, then why the trains were late again, or how sweet someone’s baby was: the kind of routine bland nothings you exchange with strangers on the street. But something about the way we speak in public is changing.A few days ago I was in Aldi, making the usual small talk at the checkout. When the cashier said she was exhausted from working extra shifts to make some money for Christmas, the man behind me chipped in that it would be worse once “she takes all our money” (in case Rachel Reeves was wondering, her budgetpitch-rollingis definitely cutting through). Routine enough, if he hadn’t gone on to add that she and the rest of the government needed taking out, and that there were plenty of ex-military men around who should know what to do, before continuing in more graphic fashion until the queue fell quiet and feet began shuffling. But the strangest thing was that he said it all quite calmly, as if political assassination was just another acceptable subject for casual conversation with strangers, such as football or how long the roadworks have gone on. It wasn’t until later that it clicked: this was a Facebook conversation come to life. He was saying out loud, and in public, the kind of thing people say casually all the time on the internet, apparently without recognising that in the real world it’s still shocking – at least for now.I thought about him when the health secretary, Wes Streeting,voiced alarmthis week that it was becoming “socially acceptable to be racist” again, with ethnic minority NHS staff fighting a demoralising tide of things people now apparently feel emboldened to say to them. What Streeting was describing – not just unabashed racism, but a sense of inhibitions disappearing out of the window more generally – goes well beyond hospital waiting rooms. You can feel it at bus stops, where polite inquiries about why the 44 doesn’t stop here any more end up wheeling off at sudden wild tangents about chemtrails or the government spying on you; or in casual school-gate chats, where otherwise perfectly ordinary-seeming parents turn out to have some very odd ideas about vaccines.A friend calls it “sauna politics”, after the surreally conspiracy-laden conversations she overhears in her local leisure centre sauna. But whatever you want to call it, it’s as if people are suddenly voicing their interior monologues – things that until recently they’d have been embarrassed to say in public, or sometimes even to admit to themselves that they thought – out loud. After all, they can say this stuff online and nobody bats an eyelid. Whynotin a hospital waiting room? It’s the conversational equivalent of young men trying out things they’ve seen in online porn on real-life girlfriends and being surprised when it goes badly – except this time the main culprits are less likely to be confused teenagers than their parents, unmoored by the dizzyingly fast collapse of social norms online and the return of slurs they haven’t heard voiced out loud since childhood.Middle-aged radicalisation sounds almost like a contradiction in terms, a reaction to all the stereotypes about settling comfortably into your rut. Besides, in our own heads, if nowhere else, gen X were always the mild-mannered peacekeepers of the culture wars: not old enough to be deemed reactionary or young enough to be woke, and instead occupying a kind of cheerfully moderate Goldilocks zone in-between. But something seems to have happened to us as we hit the midlife crisis years. Gen Xers are now old enough to start worrying that the world is changing and leaving us behind: that if we get made redundant we might not get hired again, that our marriages may not survive the shock of the kids leaving home, that our views are out of date and someone is out to get us for them, that people are laughing at us behind our backs. Though most of us get through it without a political meltdown, this time of life certainly has its casualties, seeking an outlet for bottled-up rage and disappointment that life hasn’t turned out as planned.It’s gen Xers, not grumpy pensioners or teenage boys beguiled by rightwing influencers, who are powering the populist insurgency now. Only 19% of British fiftysomethingsvoted Reform UKat the last general election buta third of those aged between 50 and 64 woulddo so now, according to YouGov, which is a staggeringly fast turnaround for the “Cool Britannia” generation that put Tony Blair in Downing Street – and key to the party’s move from fringe to mainstream. In the US, gen Xers havebeen dubbedthe “Trumpiest generation”, because they’re more likely than any other to identify as Republican.Yet with rare exceptions such as theSmidge project– a three-year ongoing international study of how conspiracy theories and disinformationspread among45- to 65-year-olds, and how deradicalisation could work for this age group – we show amazingly little curiosity about how middle-aged minds have been shaped by living through the great unregulated free-speech experiment.My generation likes to think we’re above being influenced by what we see online: that we’re more tech-savvy than our parents, less TikTok-addled than our kids, and mature enough to separate it all from real life. But the evidence suggests we’re not nearly as capable of compartmentalising as we think. Perhaps the only surprise, given how thin the fourth wall separating online and offline discourse always was, is that it’s taken this long to break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His status as the world’s first trillionaire will depend on attaining certain goals.Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersElon MuskExplainerHow Tesla shareholders put Elon Musk on path to be world’s first trillionaireA staggering compensation package has been approved – but what does Musk have to do to reap the full rewards?Maddy LauriaThu 6 Nov 2025 19.46 ESTFirst published on Thu 6 Nov 2025 03.00 ESTShareNow that Tesla stockholders have approved a plan to offer Elon Muskclose to $1tn, the clock is ticking to make the company worth eight times more than it is today.If Musk can grow Tesla to over $8tn in value for stockholders over the next decade, he will be well on his way to becoming theworld’s first trillionaire.More than 75% of shareholders voted in favor of the historic compensation plan during a vote at the company’s headquarters in Austin on Thursday. After the votes were in, Musk took the stage and danced after the news was announced.“It’s not just a new chapter forTesla,” Musk said. “It’s a new book.”The package’s approval demonstrates shareholders’ confidence that the billionaire Musk can lead the car company into an era dominated by artificial intelligence and robotics. If denied, Tesla had risked possibly losing a leader who once made the company name synonymous with electric vehicles.Musk’s status as the world’s first trillionaire, however, will depend on delivering the lofty milestones in the compensation plan. To do so, he’ll need to guideTeslato $8.5tn in market capitalization, eight times what it’s worth today. He will also be required to deploy millions of autonomous vehicles and humanoid robots and sustain the company’s bottom line in the hundreds of billions over the next decade.So where do Musk, and Tesla, go from here?The path to $1tnThe major goals of the compensation plan lay out a path for Tesla to reach the enormous market capitalization.The required milestones are separated into a dozen “tranches”, each with their own compounding goals. The first milestone, or tranche, requires reaching market capitalization of $2tn. The next nine each require an additional $500bn in growth until $8.5tn is reached by 2035. With each financial milestone also comes a product development requirement.To earn an additional 12% of the company’s stocks over the next decade, Musk must also deliver 20m of Tesla’s electric vehicles to buyers, 10m active full self-driving subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots, and deploy 1m robotaxis in commercial service. He will also be expected to grow the company to $400bn in actual earnings for four consecutive quarters. Actual earnings for the third quarter of 2025 were $4.2bn, down 9% from the year prior.At Thursday’s annual meeting, Musk described the Optimus robots, which have not yet gone into mass production, as the future of the company and of humanity. He reiterated a claim that it would be “the biggest product of all time”, and suggested they could be used in everything from healthcare to prisons.Ultimately, Musk must grow Tesla’s market capitalization from about $1tn today to $8.5tn by 2035. He also has to be vested in the company for at least seven and a half years and help it develop a long-term succession plan. As he grows the company’s worth, so too will he grow the value of stocks, and therefore his own wealth.In its proposal, the company noted that the milestones laid out “will be extraordinarily difficult and challenging for Tesla, and for Musk personally”. If these financial goals are met, it would mean Tesla would be worth nearly as much as Meta, Microsoft and Google’s parent Alphabet combined.Some say Musk couldstill reap billionseven if he doesn’t meet all of those milestones.As of November, Musk’s net worth was $460bn, the highest in the world, according toBloomberg’s Billionaire Index.Tesla’s challenges, and a new corporate homeThe vote is a resounding victory for Musk, showing investors still have faith in him even as Tesla struggles with plunging sales, market share and profits, in no small part due to Musk himself.Car buyers fled the company as Musk has ventured into politics in the US and Europe and trafficked in conspiracy theories.The vote came just three days after a report from Europe showing Tesla car sales plunged again last month, including a 50% decline in Germany.Still, many Tesla investors consider Musk as a sort of miracle man capable of stunning business feats, such as when he pulled Tesla from the brink of bankruptcy a half-dozen years ago to turn it into one of the world’s most valuable companies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He won his case, and the pay package was invalidated and rescinded.In response, Musk railed against the court and pushed for Tesla to move its corporate home from the first state to Texas. Musk’s outspoken displeasure with Delaware court rulings has been said to have fueled #DExit, a trend in which other big-name companies such as DropBox and Meta in turn threatened to move their corporate homes from Delaware.“Elon Musk has a tremendous gravitational force, and that even extends to corporate law,” saidProfessor Eric Talleyof Columbia Law School. Delaware’s title as the “mecca of corporations” went largely unchallenged, he said, “until 2024, when Elon Musk tried to rally the troops”.Courting a ‘superstar CEO’The Tesla board chair, Robyn Denholm, had publicly warned that a no vote on the 2025 compensation plan this week could mean losing Musk as CEO.In a note to shareholderssigned by Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, they said Musk “has not received meaningful compensation for eight years” due to the legal battles over the 2018 compensation plan.On Thursday, shareholders also approved a plan to compensate Musk for the pay package that was invalidated by a Delaware judge twice. The new incentive packages, added to his existing stake in the company, means he will ultimately own more than 25% of Tesla’s stock if he’s able to meet all of those milestones. As of 6 November, Tesla stock was trading close to its 52-week high, at about $450 a share.Musk’s CEO compensation exceeds the GDP of entire countries, including that of Ireland, Sweden, and Argentina. Critics of the package, including some investors, argued that awarding Musk concentrated power in one erratic leader and ignored the challenges the company has faced.“This vote shows how far Tesla’s governance has drifted from accountability and respect for the rights of shareholders,” New York state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said in a statement after the meeting. “The board has rewarded distraction and entrenched a CEO who answers to no one.”Additional voting measuresTesla shareholders on Thursday also supported the company’s proposals to elect three board members, approve 2024 executive compensation rates, and eliminate some “supermajority voting requirements.”A series of other shareholder proposals, except on one advisory measure to possibly invest in xAI that will be further reviewed by the board, were rejected. That included a proposed child labor audit across Tesla’s supply chain, related to cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaexplainersShareReuse this content"

At 1.30pm, she loads her banged-up Tacoma with her three Belgian malinois and drives to a secret Los Angeles hiking trail. There, she gulps down a tapioca pudding and laces up her sneakers. After checking over her shoulder for foot traffic, she pulls down her brown sweatpants and jiggles her bare ass for the camera. Then come the undies. Her coiffed landing strip hovers above the rocks as a rush of urine floods the trail. Every mile she walks, she films another video: a flash, a moon, a finger up the ass.When Barey decided in 2020 to pursue porn full-time, she did not imagine that at 28 she would spend more time hunched over a desk – not in the fun way – making flow charts, scheduling Zoom calls, and sending pitch decks. “I’m at my happiest when I’m making a video like putting a strawberry in my butt and pushing it out,” she says. “Now I’m on calls all day and I have tech neck.” Known online as the “Anal Princess”, with large, blinking Shelley Duvall eyes and an American Girl doll pout, she will try anything once – even the title “tech founder”.Barey is looking to disrupt the porn landscape with Hidden, a site designed to alleviate creator burnout and restore the fun in making and consuming adult content – a place where, unlike OnlyFans, she can post public exposure and piss clips from her daily lunch-break hikes.You can’t be spending your entire day making content, promoting it on socials. It’s unsustainableStella BareyHidden arrives during an uncertain time for porn, especially for gen Z. They are skeptical of it, raised on it and increasingly behind the camera themselves. The platform reflects the DIY sensibility that Barey’s generation grew up with, and its mission speaks to their conflicted relationship with big tech, sex work and making a living online. “At the end of the day, Hidden is more than porn,” Barey says. “It’s a political statement” – and one of the only sex worker-founded sex-tech companies hosting adult content today.Born in San Juan Capistrano, California and raised by a gynaecologist mother, Barey cannot remember a time when she was not insatiably curious about her body. At NYU, she invented her own major – ethical healthcare systems and policy – then finished med school prerequisites for gynaecology at University of California, Los Angeles, where she gravitated to the city’s X-rated underbelly: sex parties, industry mixers, late-night friendships with porn girls. Trapped in her apartment during the first wave of Covid, grinding through schoolwork, she started experimenting with anal sex with her then boyfriend – and sharing her sexploits via dirty story times on TikTok. “This is when TikTok still felt like this hidden little piece of the internet,” she recalls.Rise of the ‘porno-trolls’: how one porn platform made millions suing its viewersRead moreHer third video went viral. Men in the comments wanted her OnlyFans. Women wanted more story times. By 2021, Barey had given them both. OnlyFans bikini shots and nude selfies pulled in more than $40,000 a month – enough to make medical school look optional. She dropped out, figuring the white coat would wait for her. On TikTok, she became the horny professor to a cult following of gen Z women, quoting Michel Foucault, Sigmund Freud and Marquis de Sade as she spoke about the color of her vagina, STD checks, treating bacterial vaginosis (BV) and inserting a menstrual sponge – and the delights of anal sex.“I was making the sacrifice of potentially ruining my reputation to speak about sexual health and sexual topics, things 99% of the girls my age are also thinking about, in a non-stigmatized way,” Barey says. (Having a gynaecologist mom on speed dial helped.) By 2022, she had hit 750,000 TikTok followers and a $285,000 month on OnlyFans.It didn’t last. Four years prior, in 2018,federal lawmade websites legally liable for hosting material linked to sex trafficking. Spooked by the law as well as mounting pressure from banks, advertisers and religious lobbying groups, Instagram and TikTok began issuing “community violations” for even thehint of sexual content. The word obscenity, long the legal standard for what counts as “too sexual”, remained deliberately undefined, giving them carte blanche to remove anything that made them nervous. Adult creators wereshadowbanned, deleted and demonetized without warning. But they could not afford to leave the mainstream platforms altogether – that’s where they advertised their content and built fanbases.View image in fullscreenStella Barey.Photograph: Courtesy of Stella BareyTo survive, they developed their own internet survival codes, resorting to “algospeak” to circumvent obscenity guidances (“corn” for porn, “seggs” for sex, “accountant” for sex worker), VPNs and burner accounts to evade detection, and private Discords to swap intel. “We became outlaws,” Barey says. “You have no clue what is allowed or not allowed until you get hit with a violation. It’s all word of mouth.”By the end of 2022, Barey had gone through 22 TikTok accounts, many with more than 600,000 followers, buying burner phones to start from scratch each time she got booted from the platform.Severely limited by mainstream sites, sex workers sought out new havens for posting adult content, the most popular of which is OnlyFans. Whereas Pornhub and its peers monetize traffic through ads and streaming, OnlyFans monetizes relationships, letting creators sell directly to fans. By 2024, more than 4.6 million creators werepulling in$7.2bn from subscribers. But OnlyFans comes with its own set of problems. The platform is notorious for lacking creator-friendly tools. Unlike Instagram or TikTok, there is no “explore” page or discovery feed; the burden of finding an audience falls entirely on the performer, which means relentless self-promotion on the very sites that are so hostile to them. “People don’t realize that most of these girls don’t want to be doing social media – they just want to make porn,” Barey says.Once fans do make it to a creator’s page, monthly subscriptions account for only a fraction of potential earnings. The real money comes from time-consuming manual engagement, such as selling custom videos, sexts and one-to-one messaging. At one point, 70% of Barey’s income came from these direct messages. “You can’t be spending your entire day making content, promoting it on socials, and also be on your account selling to fans 24/7,” she says. “It’s unsustainable.”Everyone is getting sick of the OnlyFans model. We’re exhausted and burnt outLeila LewisThe idea for Hidden began in 2023, when a high school friend and Wharton business school grad approached Barey about co-founding a porn site. Barey set the terms: a platform designed by and for sex workers, built to promote passive income in an industry where constant performance is often the price of survival. The platform launched on 12 April with a sleek black interface and artful branding. Focused on amateur content, it recalls the Tumblr-era cam girl aesthetic – a period many creators look back on with fondness. (“Hidden” is a reference to the phone folder in which normies keep their nudes.)After clicking “18+”, users land on a TikTok-style “For You” page that serves clips tailored to their taste. Scrolling through videos and photos, one can find anything from a girl-next-door-type smiling in her pyjamas to a performer gyrating on a lubed-up dildo. See someone you like? A quick swipe to that creator’s profile is usually where the first paywall appears: a small fee to unlock their feed, view explicit posts or send a message.Barey is most excited about the ways Hidden, unlike OnlyFans, helps creators keep earning without constantly filming or messaging. The site’s algorithm promotes old videos as much as new ones, and each profile includes a built-in store where fans can buy clips and pay-per-view posts – content that creators have already made, now working for them in the background.None of Hidden’s features are brand new, Barey admits. The scrolling feed is lifted from RedGifs; the store from ManyVids; and the chargeback protections, popular among creators for making it harder for customers to dispute charges and get refunds, from SextPanther. But they are consolidated on Hidden, which also takes the smallest cut in the industry (18% of creators’ earnings, compared with OnlyFans’ 20%).For Leila Lewis, 28, a Philadelphia-based creator making over $30,000 a month on OnlyFans, the appeal was immediate. “Everyone is getting sick of the OnlyFans model. We’re exhausted and burnt out,” she says. After a consultation with Barey, she said Hidden felt like a return to the golden days – something that finally made her excited about the work again. “You can’t do fisting or pee content on OnlyFans,” which is the content her fans like best but is prohibited on themore skittishplatform, Lewis explains. “That’s why I love Hidden, because they just let you do pretty much anything.”View image in fullscreenBarey speaks at a Hidden event for creators in September.Photograph: Stella BareyBarey oversees a 40-person software team, a product designer and six content moderators, and more features are on the way. Barey and her team are building a takedown bot to scan the internet for leaks and stolen content with a single click. She is experimenting with AI tools that would let fans request personalized clips generated from a performer’s likeness (for instance, “me in a red dress on a plane”), while safeguarding ownership of their likeness from sites that are already selling nonconsensual AI versions of them. Barey even wants Hidden to handle its own payments instead of relying on third-party payment processors – an unheard-of move in the adult industry that would cut out the middlemen that drive up fees. (If she could buy a bank outright, she says, creators might one day keep nearly all of what they earn.)Ultimately, she insists it’s sex workers who will decide what comes next for Hidden. “I have a list of thousands of things, but if I’m hearing from the girls that they really want live streaming, I’m going to put that up at the top.” Meanwhile, her core crew of gen Z assistants – Drew, Chloe and Naomi, who once ran her OnlyFans and now act as her “angels” – weigh in on everything from marketing strategy to her sex tape’s final cut. Years of navigating porn sites and the minefield of social media have given them an instinct for what will resonate.So far, Hidden has registered over 113,000 users who have spent on average $53 each, and has enrolled more than 2,100 active creators – most of them gen Z women.At this momentpublic sentiment toward porn is souring. That’s in part due to the rise of “rage bait” porn, the kind of deliberately provocative content that first launched Barey into viral fame, when her TikTok about sleeping with her father’s fiftysomething best friend broke the internet. Gen Z creators such asBonnie Blueand Lily Phillips, whose exhibitionist gangbang spectacles were engineered to be detested, thrive in an ecosystem warped by burnout, censorship, algorithmic whiplash, “slop” churn, and audiences with ever-shortening attention spans. For critics, they are proof the industry has lost its grip.The backlash also mirrors cultural anxieties about sex, gender and power among gen Z. By age 13, most US teens havealready encounteredpornography, often by accident. Gen Z is the first cohort to grow up with porn not just available but ambient, algorithmically unavoidable.A generation of ‘virgins’ is leading America’s next sexual revolutionRead moreThe American Survey Center’s 2025reportfound that nearly two-thirds of men under 25 now support making online pornography harder to access – a sharp increase from previous generations. This shift could be tied to growing discomfort with porn’s ubiquity, as well as a broader conservative turn among young people (as you can see in the “NoFap” and abstinence trends spreading across TikTok). At the same time, feminist critics, gen Z or otherwise, are calling out the damaging effects of some porn, fromnormalized chokingto transactional “porn-script” sex bleeding into dating culture.Interestingly, survey data shows gen Z reports less sexual activity than earlier generations, suggesting a more cautious cohort. And yet, new Kinsey Instituteresearchfinds gen Z to be the most kink-friendly generation on record.Internet porn historian Noelle Perdue argues that the contradictions themselves are the story. “There is among younger generations this resentment towards the concept of mainstream pornography,” she says, “but they are also genuinely curious about their sexuality.” What gen Z is open to, she adds, is ethically produced porn that matches their sensitivities and desires. Recent Pornhubdataalso shows a broader cultural shift toward authenticity in porn: searches for “ethical porn” rose 92% in 2024, while “authentic sex” climbed 43%, meaning viewers are increasingly drawn to user-generated and amateur content over scripted, studio productions that can feel unrealistic.“Ethical porn”, a recent buzzword in the industry, generally refers to erotic content that is transparently and legally produced, fairly paid and filmed with mutual pleasure in mind; feminist porn filmmakers such as Erika Lust are often held up as the gold standard. Hidden is, in that sense, as ethical as a platform can reasonably claim to be: its content is self-filmed by age-verified performers who own their work and keep most of what they earn. However, one can never be entirely sure what is or is not ethical without being in the room where the sex is happening.Between her time on TikTok and an in-person erotic philosophy reading series she started last February, Barey has drawn in a wide circle of college-aged women. “I know there’s a rise in conservatism amongst gen Z, but I see this generation as the most accepting of porn of any generation yet,” she says. “They’re so supportive of sex work and understanding it as a legitimate job.”Tech companies have a long history of establishing financial sustainability by hosting explicit content and then suddenly abandoning itNoelle PerdueBy the time young people have worked out what they want – or do not want – from porn, it might be a moot point. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 went so far as toopenly callfor pornography to be outlawed and its producers imprisoned, indicating a rightwing thirst for a national ban on the industry. A less existential but more immediate threat are newage-verification lawsacross the US and UK that require users to upload government IDs or biometric data before accessing porn. Lawmakers frame these bills as child-protection measures, but in practice they penalize the very platforms trying to comply and slash the income of sex workers –especially queer and trans creatorsalready working on razor-thin margins. When Louisiana’s Act 440 went into effect in 2023, Pornhubreportedan 80% drop in traffic from the state, while VPN searches spiked. As Perdue notes, minors will always find adult content; what these laws actually do is punish compliant platforms like Hidden, OnlyFans and Pornhub, andfunnel userstoward sketchier sites rife with pirated or nonconsensual material.As of now, porn stillaccountsfor more than a third of internet data transfers. Its future could depend on creators finally taking control of the industry they built. “Tech companies have a long history of establishing financial sustainability by hosting explicit content and then suddenly abandoning it,” Perdue says. “It would be amazing to have this pattern disrupted by a company that is truly aligned with sex workers, instead of just seeing adult content as a means to a financial end.”Three dogs pant out of open windows as Barey’s pickup barrels down the freeway, away from the hiking trail. She will miss the beginning of her 2.30pm call, a meeting with her chief technology officer to review Hidden’s next software update. There is no signal on this stretch, so for a few more minutes she can remain in her favorite role – just another horny girl on the internet with a camera roll filled with nudes.“Even though porn has been around forever, this version of online sex work is so brand new,” Barey says. In this way, Hidden may be less a product than a provocation – an argument that an industry dismissed as slop can still be reinvented."

Exposure to half a million drivers every day helped the US carmaker to become the dominant electric vehicle seller in the UK. Yet drivers passing by that site now see something different: twin Chinese brands Omoda and Jaecoo, both owned by the state-controlled manufacturer Chery.Chinese cars are on a roll across Europe – they outsold Korean rivals in western Europe for the first time in September. That success is highly reliant on the UK. Of the half a million Chinese cars sold in western Europe between January and September, 30% were bought by Britons, according to Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based automotive analyst.“Their success has been remarkable,” says Steve Young, the managing director of the Hogarth dealership, which is owned by Turkish group Çetaş Otomotiv. “The site that we have here makes a statement. It’s a flag waver for us. Every minute or so the traffic lights change, and drivers are stuck outside our window.”View image in fullscreenSteve Young, standing by a Jaecoo vehicle at his west London dealership, says Chinese carmakers have ‘upped their game’.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianChina’s carmakers – backed heavily by its national and regional governments – have used the transition to electric cars as an opportunity to dominate the global automotive market.Global exports chartTrade barriers have been raised in the EU and US and the industry is struggling globally with supply chain issues. The decision by the Netherlands totake control of Nexperia, a Chinese-owned chipmaker, has promptedtit-for-tat export controlson vital semiconductors. And Beijing’srestrictions on rare earth metalsused in everything from motors to magnets have also sent shivers down car executives’ spines, as Brussels scrambles to negotiate a similar pause tolast month’s US-China trade agreement.Despite such hurdles, the UK remains resolutely open, making it a key battleground.The sales push in Britain has beenled by China’s BYD, which is expected to overtake Tesla as the world’s largest maker of battery electric vehicles this year. The UK has become BYD’s biggest market outside China, after sales in September surged tenfold compared with a year earlier.Yet others have joined the party: state-owned Chery was actually the top-selling Chinese manufacturer in the UK in October. ItsJaecoo, Omoda and Chery brandshave also targeted the UK with electric cars and hybrids, which combine a smaller battery with a petrol engine. MG has thename of a venerable UK brand, but monthly sales of its products, made by the state-owned SAIC, have overtaken those of Vauxhall, a resolutely British nameplate (albeit mostly made in Germany).Meanwhile, Sweden-based brands Volvo and Polestar are both controlled by China’s Geely, while Great Wall Motor, Volkswagen-backed Xpeng and Stellantis-backed Leapmotor have each sold more than 1,000 cars in the UK this year, ahead of an expected barrage of product launches.China sales chartIn the US, Chinese electric and hybrid cars face 100% tariffs.EU electric car tariffs range from 17% to 38%, depending on the manufacturer. Those are not prohibitive, and hybrids are not included (giving a perverse incentive for Chinese carmakers to sellvehicles that emit more pollution). Italy and Spain have also emerged as targets for Chinese sellers.But the UK – a big importer of cars – has refrained from new tariffs, and the government has been keen to import electric models in order to hit carbon dioxide reduction targets.Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a lobby group, says the UK wants both a vibrant domestic market and a strong manufacturing base – all underpinned by “free and fair trade”.“UK car buyers benefit from a choice of more than 50 global brands and the market has always been open to new entrants,” he says. Chinese brands are “driving competition as more established market players demonstrate their agility, accelerating model development and reducing costs”.Diplomatic concerns may also have played a role, although the recenttensions over alleged spying by Chinahighlight Britain’s changeable stance towards the world’s second biggest economy.“The biggest influence [in the UK not imposing tariffs] is there isn’t a domestic automotive manufacturer to protect,” says Tu Le, an ex-automotive worker in Detroit and Shanghai who founded Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy.UK market share chartSchmidt says British consumers have been more open to previous waves of foreign brands as well. In the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher as prime minister tempted the Japanese carmakers Nissan, Honda and Toyota to produce in the UK,selling it as the gateway to Europe. (That advantage was complicated 40 years later byrules of origin brought in as a consequence of Brexit.) The next wave was Korean cars, this time imported.“History is repeating itself,” says Schmidt. Britain has become Chinese brands’ first port of call in Europe – albeit without any manufacturing footprint as yet.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The joke has long worn thin. China overtook Japan as the world’s largest exporter in 2023. As well as Europe, Chinese carmakers have continued to sell in Russia, while European manufacturers have been blocked since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Latin America is also of increasing interest.“There have been two waves to the Chinese entrants coming to Europe,” says Young. “Some of the initial product was not fit for the UK market. The brands generally have upped their game.”Yet the push for scale – often backed by city regions competing with each other – has resulted in massive overcapacity in the Chinese automotive factories. The industry could theoretically make 55.5m vehicles annually, but actually used just under half that potential, according to data cited by Bloomberg from the Shanghai-based Gasgoo Automotive Research Institute.That has led to a brutal price war in the Chinese market. The Chinese Communist party hastold manufacturers to stop trying to undercuteach other,fearing “involution”, or competition so intense that it could stop progress as companies enter a self-defeating spiral.Price wars at home mean exports make even more sense. Yet Andrew Bergbaum, the global leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners, a consultancy, says the Chinese companies that have managed to break into the European market are often selling their cars at much higher prices than at home – hardly an indicator of desperation to offload products.“If you look at the brands that are actually exporting, they’re typically the strong brands,” Bergbaum says. “It’s more of a strategy than a dumping of capacity. The fact that they can sell at a higher price point is very attractive.”China’s market assault comes at a time when Europe is also struggling with excess factory capacity. AlixPartners estimated that European carmakers may have eight factories too many, as they may lose as many as 2 million sales to Chinese brands in the coming years.That excess space, coupled with a tariff incentive to build in Europe, could mean Chinese carmakers snap up sites from older rivals. That has already happened in Barcelona, where Japan’s Nissan closed its factory, only for Chery to take it over.European politicians and carmakers have argued forcefully that Chinese carmakers have benefited from heavy subsidies that have allowed them to undercut (although western carmakers have hardly been starved of assistance from their own governments). But a key reason for the Chinese sales surge is simple. Consumers like them.Tanya Sinclair, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK, an industry-funded group pushing to increase battery sales, says that “UK drivers are benefiting”.“Some names may be new, but the appeal is clear: high standards, competitive pricing, and innovation that raises the bar for everyone,” she says. “There will always be a strong place for British-built vehicles, provided they’re part of our battery-electric future. But competition and choice are what keep the market strong.”Look inside the cars, and the draw for consumers becomes clear. Bells and whistles available in some Chinese brands range from theperhaps limited appeal of in-built karaoke apps, to more advanced technology such as driver assistance. Crucially, the manufacturers are offering many of those features at much lower prices than European premium brands.“At the end of the day, it’s value,” says Le. “These cars are good. If I build better products that provide more value to my customer, I win.”Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsChinafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Musk’s fortune, which includes a stake of about 12.5% in Tesla, is already worth $461bn.“Musk isTeslaand Tesla is Musk,” says Dan Ives, a managing director at the US financial firm Wedbush. “Despite some of the brand damage Musk has caused to Tesla during his political stint, the AI future at Tesla depends on Elon.”Trump reverses course to renominate billionaire Musk ally to lead NasaRead moreIves is a self-described Tesla “core bull” who nonetheless has consistently raised concerns about the damage that the chief executive’s political stance has been doing to one of the world’s best-known brands.Tesla sales suffered as Musk’s on-off relationship with Trump –funding his presidential campaignand his stintleading sweeping cutsat the “department of government efficiency” – damaged the appeal of its vehicles to a left-leaning consumer base.There were signs of trouble before that as well, with market research firm Strategic Vision recording a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Muskbought Twitter(now X) in 2022,rolled back content moderationon the platform andreinstated banned accounts.Other off-putting factors have been swirling around the Trump soap opera, such as reports of Musk’salleged extensive drug consumption, his public support forfar-right political partiesand makingfascist-style salutes at political rallies.At one point in March, Ives warned that Tesla and Musk were embroiled in a “brand tornado crisis moment” as the backlash against the boss’s behaviour became a global problem amid falling sales. Other factors were at play in Tesla’s commercial wobbles, not least stiff competition from Chinese-made vehicles, but Musk’s notoriety has had an impact.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHow Tesla shareholders put Elon Musk on path to be world’s first trillionaireRead moreSo why have investors stuck by Musk? Shares in Tesla have risen by nearly two-thirds since May, when the Tesla chief executive announced he wasleaving the Trump administration(and then worrying investors by falling out with the president publicly). Third-quarter deliveries – a proxy for sales –trounced Wall Street estimates last monththanks to US consumers taking advantage of expiring federal tax credits for electric vehicles, although European sales suffered and analysts warned that Musk needs to cushion a post-credit slowdown by selling cheaper models.Another factor is the culture among US investors of backing high-flying innovators and entrepreneurs. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg’s control of Meta has not been challenged and Jeff Bezos had a long reign at the top of Amazon before stepping down in 2021. Indeed, most Tesla shareholders seemed concerned that Musk was devoting too little time to the company, instead of wanting him to leave altogether.“Money talks in the US more,” says Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at financial trading platform Saxo Markets. “The US has a far more entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, go-get-’em attitude so they are inclined to let innovators innovate. Plus Musk is a one-off – without him Tesla would be nowhere.”Other incentives in Musk’s$1tn pay packageinclude delivering 20m Tesla vehicles, 10m self-driving car subscriptions, 1m humanoid robots and 1m robotaxis. These targets, particularly the robots and autonomous vehicles, require the kind of entrepreneurial and technological chutzpah that Musk has shown at Tesla and his rocket company SpaceX.Matthias Schmidt, an automotive industry analyst, says the added value Musk has brought to Tesla’s stock is “undeniable” and has made “many people rich, including himself”.However, Schmidt adds that Tesla’s core car business has reached its peak and describes the autonomous vehicle plans as “certainly not the best in the market”.“Have shareholders been naively blind-sided by past achievements rather than the foresight of future prospects? Perhaps!” he says.Most Tesla investors are willing to bet $1tn otherwise.Explore more on these topicsElon MuskTeslaTechnology sectorThe super-richCorporate governanceExecutive pay and bonusesAutomotive industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

The workers claim to have been targeted for this reason, in what the union argues constitutes unlawful and retaliatory dismissals.The Guardian has contacted Rockstar Games for comment. In a statement to Bloomberg, the developer accused the fired workers of sharing confidential company information in a “public forum”, claiming that “this was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”The IWGB refuted this, saying that workers only communicated in private and on legally protected trade union channels, and did not leak any information publicly.The dismissals come ahead of the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, whichanalysts predictwill be the biggest gaming launch of all time and generate billions in sales. According to games publisher Take-Two’s most recent financial reports, its predecessor Grand Theft Auto V has generated $8.6bn since its 2013 release.On Thursday, the union organised demonstrations outside the UK head office of Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar Games’ parent company, in London and Rockstar North, the developer’s Edinburgh office. One person held a sign that read: “Grand Theft Employment” and another displayed a placard that said: “Union busted?”, referencing the “busted” screen that flashes up when a Grand Theft Auto player is caught by police.View image in fullscreenThe release of Grand Theft Auto VI has been delayed for a second time and will now launch in November 2026.Photograph: Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty ImagesIWGB organiser Fred Carter joined workers at the Edinburgh picket. He told the BBC he was there to support staff who had been fired “without warning” and “without reason”.“They’ve been fired, we believe, because they’re union members – which is a protected activity in the UK,” he said. “We’re asking people to come out and support us, to demand their jobs back and demand accountability from Rockstar.”In a statement provided by IWGB, Peter (not his real name), one of workers fired by Rockstar Games last week said: “It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account – it’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”IWGB president Alex Marshall said Rockstar Games is“afraid of hard working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.”“Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritising union busting by targeting the very people who make the game. In recent years, Rockstar have benefited from [tens of millions] in tax relief ... the only non Rockstar employees in the union Discord channel were union organisers,” Marshall said.Efforts to unionise the video games industry have gathered pace in recent years to fight back against longstanding industry practises such as “crunch” – long hours of unpaid overtime in the run-up to highly anticipated releases. In 2018, Rockstar’s co-founder Dan Houser said workers “were working 100-hour weeks” in the run-up to the release of Red Dead Redemption 2,prompting scrutinyover the company’s treatment of employees. At the time, Rockstar North’s Rob Nelson responded directly: “We are always trying to improve how we are working and balance what we are making with how we make it, and we will not stop working to improve in this area.”On Thursday, the developer announced that Grand Theft Auto VI, which was due to release on 26 May,had been delayedto the end of 2026. The game’s development, which has been delayed for a second time, is being anchored by the Edinburgh team.Explore more on these topicsGamesnewsShareReuse this content"

Meanwhile, Mikie Sherrill, a poster child for centrist Democrats, won big in light-blue New Jersey. And in ultra-progressive New York, the democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, predictably, took the mayoralty. With such varied success, what could be the common lesson?First, all of these candidates took the economy seriously. Mamdani has long been praised, even by moderates, for making his campaign all about affordability. But this was no less true for Sherrill and Spanberger, who moved in a decidedly populist direction with their campaigns. At times, centrist Sherrill evensoundedlike Bernie Sanders. That’s good.Zohran Mamdani shows how Democrats can defeat authoritarians like Trump | Isabella WeberRead moreSecond, all of these candidates successfully distanced themselves from unwise (and unpopular) progressive positions on crime and the fringier elements of the social justice brigade. As a result, they broadened their appeal. Also good. And suggestive that a commonsense populism can serve as the path back to power for Democrats.To be sure, enduring structural problems remain; for one thing, all of these candidates are rich. That’s not good. Sherrill washammered on the campaign trailabout the millions she made while in Congress. But Mamdani, too, is the son of elites; his mother is a world-famousmillionaire moviemakerwithhomes on three continents. These aren’t great credentials for Democrats trying to demonstrate their everyman qualities to working-class voters who have turned their backs on the party.Still, Mamdani was the big star of the night. And for good reason. Not only was Mamdani the only outsider candidate, facing down long odds and big money; he alone offered the inspirational vision that Democrats so desperately need. He has a compelling theory of society, one that helps voters make sense of the madness that is our new Gilded Age, and a political program that flows naturally from that theory. As a result he offers a more persuasive political vision than the establishment’s poll-tested “popularism” – which amounts to asking voters what they already like and then insisting that Democrats conform to the survey results. Voters want to elect leaders, and leaders have to have a vision of the way society ought to look. Mamdani does. The Democrats, by and large, do not.The cruel political irony is, of course, that candidates such as Mamdani, who have the far-reaching vision to propose a new economic model, who have the bravery to challenge the political establishment and who have the charisma to inject some life into the political scene, tend to win in the kinds of places where they have the least leverage – uber-progressive, rich, global cities. This, in turn, threatens to limit their appeal, and their power, to the level of government least capable of winning the world they want.Municipal government – even in a city that is home to Wall Street – is simply not fit to fuel real economic change. It’s not that Mamdani has promised policies far beyond the scope of feasibility. His program was limited. And given thatNew YorkCity is very rich, from a budget perspective, his policies are affordable. But class politics aren’t like accounting: it’s not whether the government can afford it, it’s whether the rich will allow it.Billionaires have long been threatening that a Mamdani election would send the rich packing. An exodus of well-to-do New Yorkers, who feel they are already overtaxed, would starve the budget and force a conservative turn at city hall. The flight of the rich isn’t particularly likely, but it is a danger. This is why so much of social policy must be decided at the national, and not the local, level. Just look at theexodusof California residents to low-tax red states such as Texas and Florida, which has been aboonfor those states and headache for California. With the continued allure of remote work, it’s not something Mamdani can afford to ignore. Which is why he went out of his way to assure the elite that he won’t be soaking the rich so much as splashing them.This structural challenge is compounded by the nature of liberal urban politics and the perceptions of voters in anationalizedpolitical environment. Of course, Mamdani made great efforts to broaden the left’s base. He steered his campaign away from wrongheaded activist slogans about defunding the police or abolishing prisons. He very intentionally projected a sense of respectability and responsibility – he was almost exclusively pictured in a suit and tie. And as a result he was able to win voters well beyond the narrow confines of New York’s “commie corridor” and reach deep into working-class outer-borough neighborhoods.Yet, as Woody Allensaidin Annie Hall: “The rest of the country looks upon New York like we’re leftwing, communist, Jewish, homosexual pornographers.” And despite his clear moderation on a whole host of liberal cultural crusades, Mamdani does advocate a soft touch on drugs, crime and sex work. Again, this is fine … for New York. But for their political program to succeed, populists like him need federal power and for that they need national appeal. Mamdani’s supporters need to confront a real danger. As the mayor-elect is catapulted to the unofficial position of leader of the American left, progressive populism risks being even more tightly associated with the views and values of Park Slope’s young professionals.National Democrats have a lot to learn from Mamdani. If they want to retake Congress, they need to learn what it is to have conviction and a vision that goes beyond tinkering with the tax code. At the same time, if populists are to have a hope of implementing their program, they must break out of the political confines of deep-blue cities.Dustin Guastella is the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia, and a research associate at the Center for Working-Class PoliticsExplore more on these topicsDemocratsOpinionZohran MamdaniUS politicsNew JerseyVirginiaNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

Or at least the preparation. Democrats, along with many others around the world, cheered this week’s wins in a clutch of off-year elections that saw Donald Trump’s Republicansdefeated from sea to shining sea. But now they need to brace themselves for the reaction. Because Donald Trump does not like losing. And he will do everything he can to ensure it does not happen again – by means fair and, more often, foul. Indeed, that effort is already under way.For now, the Democrats are still clinking glasses, enjoying a success that tastes all the sweeter for coming exactly a year after they lost everything – the House, the Senate and the White House – to a returning and triumphant Trump. The most dramatic win was Zohran Mamdani’shistory-making victoryin America’s most populous city, New York, but there was success too at the other end of the continent, as voters in California backed Democrats on anapparently technical measurethat could prove hugely significant. In between, Democrats won the governorships of New Jersey and Virginia by healthy, double-digit margins.All this has displeased Trump, but it is the election of Mamdani in Trump’s home city that brought the swiftest response. The forces of Maga have wasted no time in making the man Trump calls a“100% communist lunatic”the face of the Democratic party. The New York Post went early, with a front pageshowing the new mayorclutching a hammer and sickle, next to the headline “The Red Apple”, with the R reversed to looks suspiciously Soviet. Fox Business also broke out the Bolshevik graphics for asegment on the global threat posed by socialism, featuring international testimony on the failures that ensue when profit is not paramount – including reports on Britain’s own “broken” National Health Service.The Republican goal is clear enough: to ensure that next year’s nationwide midterm elections – where control of the House of Representatives is on the line – can be fought against a Democratic party recast as Mamdani Marxists. Right now, Democrats are confident they can see off that danger, uniting behind a common message of “affordability”, even as they tailor it to different audiences in different places – much as they did this week, with the victors in Virginia and New Jersey pressing the same cost of living themes as Mamdani but in moderate, suburban colours. That approach could work next year, when the battle for the House amounts to 435 separate elections. Come thepresidential election of 2028, however, when Democrats will have to forge a single, national message behind a single, national candidate who can appeal to both cities and suburbs, it will be harder.View image in fullscreenDemocrat Mary Sheffield, who became the first woman elected mayor of Detroit, speaks during an election night watch party in the city, 4 November 2025.Photograph: Paul Sancya/APStill, that is the kind of challenge politicians are used to tackling. A darker menace looms, and not only in Trump’s heavy hints that he couldcut off federal funding to New York. Recall that the president has already broken all precedent by sending US troops into Washington DC and Los Angeles and by attempting to do so in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, supposedly to crack down on rampant crime but, in fact, to assert control over politically disobedient centres of power. No wonder many New York observers suspect it is only a matter of time before Trump dispatches the National Guard to Brooklyn and the Bronx, now that Gotham is in the hands of a sworn foe. Trump always wanted to conquer New York City; now he might just do it.Such a move would be of a piece with the series of actions Trump seems set to take – or is already taking – to ensure the elections of November 2026 are not allowed to go the way they did this week. Put simply, next year’s contests matter too much for him to let that happen. As of now, Trump has total control of all three branches of the US government: the White House, obviously, but also the supreme court and both houses of Congress, thanks to pliant judges in the former and Republican majorities in the latter. The Senate is unlikely to shift, but given the currently tiny Republican majority in the lower chamber, and the usual midterm swing against an incumbent party, every conventional sign would point to a Democratic takeover of the House in 12 months. If that happens, the rubber stamp will be replaced by a genuine check on the president’s power, one that – especially worrying for him – would have the authority to investigate and hold to account both Trump and those who serve him.He is determined to avert that outcome. That’s why he leaned on Republicans in Texas, demanding they redraw congressional boundaries to eke out five more safe Republican seats. It was to offset that earlier Texas move that California Democrats asked voters this week for the power to do some redistricting of their own, to give their party up to an extra five Democratic seats in the House.Californians said yes, even those who fear this tit-for-tat gerrymandering represents a race to the bottom that can only weaken US democracy.But Trump is not done. He has pushed Republicans in North Carolina, Ohio, Missouri and Indiana to follow Texas’s lead, hoping to squeeze out enough extra seats so that his party keeps the House even if voters desert them next November. Others are bracing for a supreme court decision that could weaken a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, one that currently permits state legislatures to consider race when deciding congressional boundaries. That measure has allowed for the crafting of districts that ensure that voters from minorities see their favoured candidates elected. If the court outlaws that practice, Republican-controlled state legislatures could move toeliminate those districts altogether, depriving Democrats of around a dozen seats in the south.Those are only the most visible threats. In an essay in The Atlantic, David A Grahamcharts the myriad waysin which Trump and his allies are already working to subvert the midterm elections. Some of it is old-fashioned voter suppression – making the casting of a ballot harder by, say, reducing the availability of early and postal voting or demanding specific forms of ID – while some of it is intimidation.In the elections just gone, the Trump-controlled department of justice sent “monitors” to watch over polling places in Democratic-leaning areas. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents aresnatching even US citizens off the streets, you can see how the presence of Trump-loyal “monitors” might have a chilling effect, persuading some voters that they’d be safer staying home. The presence of troops in battle fatigues on the streets, which a year from now will come to seem normal in several US cities, will have the same effect – only more so.All of this comes as Trump has gutted the agency charged withkeeping elections secure, slashed funding for theprotectionof voting from cyber-attack and looked on as many diligent election officials, including traditional Republicans, have been driven out of office and replaced by Maga activists.Even if the 2026 elections go ahead unhindered, the danger does not end there. Graham warns that Trump could declare a state of emergency, seizing voting machines before a tally is made official. A defeated Republican House speaker could refuse to seat victorious Democrats (as, in fact,Speaker Mike Johnson is already doing). And, through it all, there would be loud voices on Fox News, on social media and perhaps even on some of the mainstream networks that have recentlybent the knee to Trump, defending if not applauding his every move.This week’s results suggest that, if it’s a fair fight, Democrats can win a year from now, finally putting a brake on Trump’s march towards autocracy. But that’s a big if – and with each passing day, it’s only getting bigger.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist and host of thePolitics Weekly America podcastGuardian newsroom: Year One of Trumpism: Is Britain Emulating the US?

How low he has sunkRobert ReichThe president has put Snap benefits in jeopardy amid a fight over Medicaid. The nation has lost its moral authorityFri 7 Nov 2025 10.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 17.27 ESTShareThe Democrats had a great day on Tuesday. It’s crucial that they hone their economic message for next year’s midterms to focus on affordability and fairness.Trump is doing the opposite. Althougha federal court orderedhim to continue to provide food stamps to about 42 million low-income Americans who depend on them, Trump threatened to deny them anyway until the end of the government shutdown.In a post on social media on Tuesday, he said benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), commonly referred to as food stamps, “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up the government, which they can easily do, and not before!” TheWhite House later confirmedit would comply with a court order to use emergency funds to support Snap – but the administration said users wouldreceive only halfof what they typically do. On Thursday, the saga continued, with a court ordering the administration to fully fund Snap benefits in November; the administrationmoved to appeal.How low Trump has sunk.Eighty-eight years ago, in his second inaugural address, Franklin D Roosevelt told America that “the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.”It was not a test of the nation’s military might or of the size of the national economy. It was a test of our moral authority. We had a duty to comfort the afflicted, even if that required afflicting the comfortable.The Trump regime has adopted the reverse metric. The test ofitsprogress is whether it adds to the abundance of those who have much and provides less for those who have too little. It is passing thistest with flying colors.What is the Democrats’ demand amid the shutdown? That lower-income Americans continue to receive subsidized healthcare. Otherwise,healthcare premiums for millionsof lower-income Americans will soar next year in large part because the Trump Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act (really, Big Ugly Bill) slashed Obamacare subsidies.Republicans had rammed the Big Ugly Bill through Congress without giving Senate Democrats an opportunity to filibuster it because Republicans used a process called “reconciliation”, requiring only a majority vote of the Senate.The Big Ugly Bill also requires Medicaid applicants and enrollees – also low-income – to document at least80 hours of work per monthMany people dependent on Medicaid won’t be able to do this, either because they’re not physically able to work or won’t be able to do the required paperwork to qualify for an exemption from the work requirement.The Congressional Budget Office, as assessed byKFF, estimates the work requirement will be the largest source of Medicaid savings, reducing federal spending on the low-income Americans by$326bnover 10 years andcausing millions to become uninsured.All told, the Big Ugly Bill cuts roughly$1tnover the next decade from programs for which the main beneficiaries are the poor and working class, and gives about$1tnin tax benefits to the richest members of our society.It is the most dramatic reversal of FDR’s moral test in American history.By the time of FDR’s second inaugural address in 1937, most of the country was still ill-housed, ill-fed, and ill-clothed. Yet we were all in it together. The fortunes of the robber barons of the Gilded Age had mostly been leveled by the Great Crash of 1929.Perhaps it was easier under those circumstances to accept the idea that the test of our progress wasn’t whether we added more to the abundance of those who had much but provided enough for those who had too little.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFollow Robert ReichFree newsletterGet Robert Reich’s latest columns delivered straight to your inboxEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The obvious solution: move back in with your parentsFri 7 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 06.02 ESTShareIn our modern age, the only thing worse than flying – cramped seats, bad food, someone potentially calling you a racial slur – is not flying at all. I will suffer all manner of indignity, up to and including a drunk puking up Jersey Mike’s on to my trousers, but if you dare say that I might not be able to board the Flying Nightmare Tube at the scheduled date and time, I will throw the kind of fit you only see in YouTubevideos of people that are actuallyon airplanes.This is why the United States Federal Aviation Administration potentiallycancelling 10%of air traffic at 40 airports chills me to the bone. Whether I like it or not, I have to be in Pittsburgh this month. Would you keep me from enjoying the epic sights and sounds ofPittsburgh? Maybe so, if the alternative is a sleep-deprived air traffic controller suggesting my pilot take a nosedive into the Grand Tetons.The reason for this calamity is as clear as the skies will be after1,800 flights a dayare grounded. The record-breaking government shutdown has led to vital air travel workersworking without pay. Nothing like asking people to work for nothing, especially people categorized as “essential workers”. What is this, an internship in the movie business?If only the Democrats had less of a backbone, we could all go back to the awful version of normal we were just starting to become resigned toThe transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, who first wowed us with his knowledge of transportation on MTV’sReal World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle of the Seasons, declared it necessary to take this path because someone (but definitely not his boss) hasallowed the government to go unfunded for over a month. If only the Democrats had less of a backbone, we could all go back to the awful version of normal we were just starting to become resigned to.I would not dare ask anyone in this political climate to do boring things like “govern” or “find consensus for the betterment of society as a whole”. I’m not a child, after all. What I would suggest is that, if one can find the money to pay ICE agents and the military, surely there must be a few billion lying around to pay the person who keeps planes from exploding.But while you’re frantically refreshing your airline app, praying to an unforgiving deity to be granted the privilege of your seatmate removing their shoes inside a metal room with no open windows, try to look at it from the sunny side of the street for a moment. American Airlines suggested thatdisruptions would be minimal. Long-haul international flights, the airline said, would continue as scheduled. You can always find another flight, if you simplymust go to Pittsburgh immediately.This is likely to be only mildly annoying for most of us … unless, of course, it stretches into Thanksgiving week. You know, that period when significantly more people fly. More than30 million peopleflew during the Thanksgiving holiday period last year. Sadly for the FAA and our political leaders in Washington, all of those people have families who love them and will want to see them again this year.Since familial obligation and affection is probably not getting wiped out of human civilization in the near term and we can’t expect the government shutdown to end before that, the only other option is to do what we should have done five years ago: move back in with our parents.I understand this might feel a bit outrageous to say out loud, considering our western society considers living with your parents to be “pathetic”, “embarrassing” or “a sign of a diseased mind”, but use some actual logic for once. The cost of living continues to rise. Wages are stagnant. Layoffs last month came in at thehighest levels for October in 22 years. Work is scarce and low-paying. Employment is so hard to come by thatair traffic controllers are currently working for free.I couldn’t afford to buy a house unlessDB Cooperappeared from behind a bush and handed me a briefcase of cash from the 1970s. Since that’s probably not going to happen, the next best choice is to live with my mom, who owns property, has passive income from her retirement, and has no problem running the air conditioner all day.You see, if you live with your family, you never have to travel for the holidays. If you never have to travel for the holidays, you save on fossil fuel consumption, and alleviate congestion and understaffing at the airport. And we’ll never have to reopen the government, giving everyone on Capitol Hill more time to do absolutely nothing about our crumbling infrastructure. A mass movement to return to our childhood homes would save all of us from the punishing burden of having to try too hard – especially people in politics, perhaps our most labor-averse career path. The only people who love recess more than members of Congress are third-graders.We can all go back to third grade, in a way, if we surrender to the bosom of the last vestiges of generational wealth in this country. Our parents worked the same job for 40 years so we could be laid off every two years. The only way this system we have built like an Ikea bookshelf missing an entire bag of screws can function is if we collectively read the room. We’re cooked. Artificial intelligence is going to make your remote copywriting job irrelevant in two years, so you might as well get ahead of it.Hey, speaking of, maybe AI can manage the complex network of air travel? If I just thought of that, you can bet some billionaire moustache twirler considered it, too. I bet thatterrifying eventuality will go smoothly.Dave Schilling is a Los Angeles-based writer and humoristExplore more on these topicsUS federal government shutdown 2025OpinionUS federal government shutdownsAirline industrycommentShareReuse this content"

There was a previous example of a state governor, Sir Philip Game, sacking a Labor government, and older instances of the British monarch dismissing ministries:Gough Whitlamrecalled George III’s dismissal of the Fox-North coalition in 1783.In 1975, few Australians seriously believed that the vice-regal dismissal of a democratically elected government was business as usual. Accordingly, alongside the relief of anti-Whitlam partisans, there was widespread shock, dismay and anger.Whitlam called on his supporters to “maintain your rage”. Many did not need his encouragement.This is a story that remains to be told: the dismissal as it played out in public meetings, on the streets, and through strikes, protests and demonstrations. Thanks to the millions of words written about the dismissal over a half century, we know a great deal about most of the principal actors; Whitlam, opposition leader Malcolm Fraser, governor general Sir John Kerr and Sir Garfield Barwick, the chief justice who advised Kerr. Thanks to recent archival discoveries – especially those facilitated by the release of the palace letters after successful litigation by historianJenny Hocking– we know much more than we did a decade ago.Letters of an insecure and indiscreet John Kerr make a mockery of the claim that the Queen played ‘no part’ | Jenny HockingRead moreBut we know less about what we might call “the dismissal from below”, which borrows from a historical practice that looks at events from the perspective of ordinary people on the ground rather than leaders at the top. Several were conscious of the potential for public disorder in a decade when protest was more widespread, more vigorous and, on occasion, more violent than today.The greatest potential for disorder came from the possibility of the unions mounting a general strike in support of the deposed Labor government. They had the numbers (about 55% of workers belonged to trade unions in the mid-1970s compared with about 12.5% today) and they also had experience. In 1969, Australia’s unions had brought the country to a near-standstill during a general strike in support of Clarrie O’Shea, a tramway union official who went to prison after his union flouted the Arbitration Commission. The judge in the case was none other than John Kerr. There seemed to be even more at stake a few years on.Kerr himself spotted the danger, writing to the palace shortly after the first rallies and strikes in mid-October: “As the money runs out many problems will arise and the reaction of the trade unions has to be considered. There are threats of protest, strikes and industrial ‘war’.”Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsBob Hawke, president of both the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Labor party, hinted at the possibility of a general strike in a speech delivered outside Parliament House, just as supply was being blocked, but he quickly changed tack. After the dismissal, Hawke and Whitlam encouraged supporters instead to donate “a day’s pay for democracy” for Labor’s election campaign – a decision that disappointed the more militant unions.Some within the Coalition also feared violence. Ian Macphee, a Victorian Liberal moderate, wrote in a letter to Fraser that if the Coalition won an election “stemming from the present crisis we will have the outright hostility of nearly 50 per cent of the electorate”. John Gorton, formerly prime minister but now a renegade from the Liberal party, thought the political crisis might lead to “riots and strikes … fighting in the streets”.Fear of popular disorder was real. It didn’t materialise as expected, but there were some violent episodes. A letter bomb exploded in the building that contained the Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen’s office, badly injuring two staff. Others were sent to Fraser and Kerr, though without causing damage. There were open fights between Whitlam and Fraser supporters, occasional clashes with police and a storming of the Sydney Stock Exchange that went wrong when the would-be revolutionaries got lost in the building. It is often forgotten that – despite the lack of a general strike – hundreds of thousands of workers did walk off the job.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

The world turned its back and is now paying the price | Roland BurkeRead moreMore notably, the dismissal from below was, mainly, peaceful. You were more likely to hear songs, chants, see placards or a street play satirising Kerr and Fraser than violence.It is possible to discern in the events that followed the dismissal something of the political order that would take shape in the 1980s. That new order was embodied in Hawke, who would become parliamentary Labor leader just before the party’s 1983 return to power. In 1975, the country’s more militant unions castigated Hawke for “betraying” the labour movement over his failure to call a general strike. But the middle ground Hawke occupied – which could seem like a contrast with the anger of Whitlam – struck a chord with the Australian public.After the 1975 election, Hawke received letters from Fraser supporters who expressed their admiration for Hawke’s “spirit of moderation and of true democracy”. As one wrote: “I don’t share Bob Hawke’s politics, but I do admire Bob Hawke the man.” Some Australians quickly saw the appeal of the consensus politics that would form the centrepiece of his successful pitch to voters in 1983.Time has been favourable to Whitlam and his government. Where popular memory was once dominated by chaos and crisis, it is now the policy legacy, and the manner of the man himself, that loom largest.Yet, for a time in 1975, Australian democracy appeared a fragile thing. It proved robust in the end – thanks in large part to the creativity of ordinary Australians who agitated for their country’s democratic culture, system and institutions. In a world where democracy seems in decay, we could learn much from the vigilance of those who rallied as spring turned to summer in 1975.Frank Bongiorno is a professor of history at the Australian National University and Distinguished Fellow of the Whitlam Institute within Western Sydney UniversityJames Watson is a historian at the Australian National University’s School of HistoryExplore more on these topicsGough WhitlamPast/PresentAustralian politicsMalcolm FrasercommentShareReuse this content"

That’s hard to dismiss, and gives us an opportunity for hopeFri 7 Nov 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 11.32 ESTShareWhen I first read Shereen Daniels’ report30 Patterns of Harm, a damning review of anti-Black racism within the Metropolitan police,I didn’t feel outrage – I felt recognition. The report lays bare what Black Londoners have long known: racism in policing isn’t a case of occasional failures. It is structural – and, left unexamined, itreproduces.I also felt something else: the faint possibility of change. For perhaps the first time, the Met has chosen to see itself clearly. Followingclaims that the review had been “buried”, the service has finally publishedDaniels’ reportand companion guide.What makes this differentfrom the1999 Macphersonand2023 Caseyreports is that it turns the lens inward. Those earlier reviews drew on public testimony and external critique, while Daniels’ analysis uses the Met’s own internal correspondence, policies and governance papers to expose how racial harm is reproduced through decision-making, culture and leadership. And crucially, the commissioner allowed it to be released “without dilution or internal sign-off” – a level of transparency that neither previous inquiry achieved. That act of honesty is the beginning of transformation.Daniels’ findings mirror those of theMacpherson inquiryand theCasey review. Both were landmark investigations that exposed the Met’s structural racism and deep cultural dysfunction. But what distinguishes this moment is the Met’s own admission – set out in the commissioner’s letter to partners accompanying the report – that “whatever we have achieved to date … there will be more to do”. In choosing to reflect and engage rather than react instinctively, the Met is acknowledging that cultural transformation must be lived every day.As co-chair of the Black Community Policing Advisory Panel, which works alongside the Met to provide advice and counsel, I see daily the weariness among Black Londoners – a fatigue born of countless apologies and unfulfilled promises. We do not need more reports just pointing out the harm. What we really need are solutions that actually help to heal it.Those solutions are not abstract.They align with the priorities the commissioner has set out in response: to address systemic biases and imbalances; to review police powers; and to tackle the root causes of disproportionate outcomes for Black Londoners. They begin with radical transparency: publishing data on recruitment, promotion, discipline and the use of police powers such asstop and search. They demand genuine accountability – a sharedoversight body of senior officers, community representatives, academics and panel advisers with the power to question and correct. And they rely on co-designing reforms with those most affected.True progress will come when the lived experiences of Black officers and Black Londoners define the metrics of success. That means equity audits and regular public scorecards; an independent “trust-by-design” review of stop and search shifting the practice from one that is rooted in suspicion to one that genuinely focuses on safeguarding.But technical fixes are not enough. Tackling systemic racism demands courage from those with power. It requires the Met’s leaders, and indeed all of us who serve public life, to ask a harder question: what does safety look like when everyone belongs?There are glimpses of that future already. Youth and faith organisations are working alongside local officers to divert young people from criminalisation. Though confidence in local police has been falling in England and Wales in recent years, there was aslight uptickrecently. These are seeds of change worth nurturing.Daniels’ report reminds us that anti-Blackness betrays organisational dysfunction – and that confronting it directly is key to fostering genuine inclusion. When systems become fairer for Black people, they become fairer for everyone.The work ahead will be slow and often uncomfortable. But outrage alone will not sustain it. What we need now is disciplined hope. Reflection must lead to reform, and reform must be felt in the daily lives of Londoners.The Met cannot mark its own homework. Nor can it rebuild trust through words alone. It must choose transformation over defensiveness, humility over haste. If it does, 30 Patterns of Harm will be remembered not for its indictment, but rather as an invitation to bring about a true justice that can be shared by all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The institution can no longer dismiss the critique as external judgment – it is, in effect, a mirror held up by its own hand. That self-exposure creates a kind of moral accountability that no government inquiry or independent review could ever fully impose.Because in the end, the real measure of the Met’s success is whether it polices by consent rather than control. To do this it needs to foster genuine relationships with the community it serves.

No wonder divisive forces in politics and the press are working to undermine itFri 7 Nov 2025 10.24 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 13.05 ESTSharePublic satisfaction with the NHS is at its lowest ever level, according to the most recentBritish Social Attitudessurvey:just 21%of patients are quite or very satisfied with the state it is in. Deep analysis of the feedback makes for grim reading. Jim Mackey, the chief executive of NHS England, now warns: “We have damaged our relationship with the population and it’s their service. We only exist at their will.” Public satisfaction is one of the most important of all targets, he said, along withthe NHS staff survey, which shows that only 64% would recommend their service to a family member.He was speaking at the King’s Fund annual conference this week, where graphs showing public attitudes cast waves of gloom. Access to GPs, hospital appointments and A&E were top public concerns; social care has only 13% approval; and the young are more dissatisfied than the old. On quality, the public is a little more forgiving: 51% were pleased with the quality ofNHScare. But people are perverse. Nearly three-quarters think the NHS doesn’t get enough money and it needs more staff – yet people are evenly split on whether to pay more tax to fund the NHS, or stay as we are. People use an easy excuse for not paying more for public services: 51% claim the NHS doesn’t spend its money well. One incident, one pointless letter sends a message of inefficiency.This fall in satisfaction is deeply wounding to the self-image of a country that counts the NHS asthe top reason to be proudof Britain: remember thosechildren bouncing on NHS bedsat the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony. There is a national belief that the NHS brings out the best in us, never more than when volunteers poured in to help during the Covid-19 pandemic. But how secure is that collective good will, with its equalising impulse? When offered a long list of NHS priorities, people ranked “improving the health of the disadvantaged” last. The public doesn’t share the NHS’s own commitment to reaching those least likely to come forward for early care, in maternity, cancer or screening. And increasing numbers of the public don’t seem to respect NHS workers, according to some speakers at the conference. One leader in the ambulance service warned of the escalating racist violence against paramedics; other NHS speakers blamed the increasing political discourse focusing on race and illegal migration for therising racism against staff.Young people want to ‘go private’ – I’m a lifelong supporter of the NHS, but I can see why | Frances RyanRead moreYet support for those founding NHS principles remains strong: 91% say it should definitely or probably be free at the point of use to everyone, and funded by general taxation (80%). But there is a worrying wobble: the number saying it should “definitely” be available to all fell from 67% to 56% last year. Who would they exclude – the undeserving, the foreign-born or anyone not like them?Reform party supporters are least satisfiedwith the NHS (13%). They areleast likely to believein those founding principles of the NHS.These attitude surveys can’t tell us where people get views from. Is all this dissatisfaction from direct personal experiences, or those of a family or friend, or of the 1.5 million who work in it – or from the horror anecdotes that make the news? Seeing that stark7.4 million waiting listnumber may be enough for some to make their judgment. The rightwing media is hostile to the NHS on principle, ever eager for discrediting stories. For there is a chasm in “satisfaction with the NHS” between the general public and patients actually using the services. The Care Quality Commission constantly surveys patients:those coming out of hospitalmostly report good treatment, and people are pretty satisfied with their GPs, with75% finding their experience good. But Dan Wellings, the King’s Fund analyst making this week’s presentation, points to the perennial problem: even highly satisfied patients still believe the worst of the NHS, assuming they’ve been lucky against the odds.The NHS is the political talisman by which voters judge the state of all public services. Labour switchers tell More in Common that they will judge whether to return by the state of the service. Voters are insanely impatient: 65% of Labour voters only gave them a year to make a difference; 10% expected it “immediately”.Labour inherited this ocean liner leaking below the hull, bitterly remembering that they handed it over in2010 in its best condition ever. Now winter flu is arriving in hospitals early, resident doctors are striking without enough cause and this government seems blighted by any passing stroke of bad luck. But the Health Foundation’s latest polling shows a beginning of a break in the clouds. Referrals on to the waiting list increase by 1.5%, while removals from the waiting listrise by 2.3%– nearly enough to meet the target this parliament of92% starting treatment within 18 weeks. Theyalso find“people’s experiences of their local NHS services are notably more positive than views of how the health service is performing overall”. Views of local services are net positive: 46% say their local NHS gives them a good service; 28% disagree. In survey after survey,those who use the NHSmost are most positive about it.What’s needed is a reminder that the NHS is a collective service. Citizens own it and share it. Tony Blair wanted tomake booking a hospital bedas easy a choice as booking an air ticket, but that was a disastrously misleading category error. Patients are not shoppers or consumers. Most people understand that. But some need reminding that in a system limited by taxpayers’ cash, one group lobbying successfully means another group of patients gets less. Most people, according to the King’s Fund researchers, do keep that sense of social solidarity. But beware these cracks emerging from Reform supporters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Epic congratulations to Alan, a full-spectrum entertainment booking, who from the first minutes of this season catapulted himself to the status of high-value national treasure, while Joe Marler also leapfrogged 27 stardom categories in the public imagination and should now be made Duke of York. And look, it wasn’t all bad for historian and Guardian Scott Trust board member David Olusoga. Thanks to the deputy PM and justice secretary, he was only the second mostspectacularly wrong Davidof the week.But why am I bringing politics into it? After all, one of the most remarkable shifts I haven’t been able to help noticing during this epic first run of TheCelebrityTraitors is that no senior politician has attempted to refer to the show as a way of currying public favour. They’d certainly get short shrift if they tried. But this represents a radical break with the past 20 years, where politicians and prime ministers became transfixed by the popularity of reality TV. In the first twisted heyday of the genre, politicians really thought it was the answer and they could steal its best bits to succeed in their own trade. Now I think that even they realise a show like The Celebrity Traitors is the thing people escape to in an age when none of our leaders have any answers.Only one man – the biggest reality TV star of that first golden era – instinctively understood the explosively popular new genre’s dynamics and true meaning and import, and bent them to his will. He is now enjoying a second residency, not in Vegas, but in the White House. Vladimir Putin also got it. But in the anglophone world, all the other politicians had reality TV totally wrong.Wronger than Kate Garraway, if that puts it into perspective.Even so, their dances with the genre make for fascinating cultural history. It seems mad to recall, but Gordon Brown was so convinced by his vision for something called “an X Factor Britain” that as prime minister hewrote personal lettersto all the 2008 finalists of Simon Cowell’s ITV talent show, while dealing with the global financial crisis. Alexandra Burke won. (That year’s X Factor– not the global financial crisis.) A few months earlier, the then PM had made anappearance on American Idol. Brown was even approached to be a judge himself, on a show provisionally entitled Junior PM that was pitched for BBC One. One of his secretaries of state was photographed carrying a printed email about this proposed format to a cabinet meeting. This contained the producers’ pitch for a show that would make the prime minister “more popular than Sir Alan Sugar” – !!! – in a space aimed at the “Apprentice meets Maria meets Strictly Come Dancing” audience. The Tories promptly gave Strictly host Bruce Forsyth a ticket to watch the next PMQs in the Commons public gallery, where they kept shouting “you’re fired!” at Brown.By the David Cameron era, Cowell’s endorsement was regarded as so market-moving that the Sunsplashed his backingfor Cameron on the morning before the 2010 election. Cowell himself was convincedreferendums were the future, claiming that local editions of his reality show in non-democracies or fragile ones, such as Afghanistan, had “given democracy back to the world”. It was striking how often those who had risen via reality television were deemed the answer. Prospect magazine voted Russell Brand the fourth most influential political thinker in the world in 2015. (This was the same year he askedwould-be Labour prime ministerEd Miliband: “Since suffrage, since the right to vote, what has meaningfully occurred?”)It’s notable that The Traitors, like the original US Apprentice (and its UK spin-off), are not shows in which there is a public vote. But so many were, and there was much to be read into the way in which a significant section of the public was casting its ballots, if only we had extrapolated it. The always entertainingly brilliant Alwyn Turner digs into this inAll in It Together, his history of England in the 21st century. First, you had the public repeatedly pressing the fuck-you button andvoting for John Sergeantevery week on Strictly. The former BBC political correspondent’s dancing was terrible, but voters knew that backing him would incense the elites trying to push them in different directions. I will not be taking questions on this opinion, but … this was the Brexit vote foreshadowed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Claudia Winkleman was 51% trusted, against Rachel Reeves on 15%. Carr (the most recognisable star among the public, it found) scored 50% trust against 22% for Nigel Farage. It would be fun to see how those numbers have changed over the past month.The other big thing that has changed decisively in recent times is the calibre of people attracted to primetime reality TV. The lineup for The Celebrity Traitors was hugely impressive, and final confirmation that, when highly produced, this genre’s reputation as a home for has-beens is totally dead. The Celebrity Traitors was the ultimate prestige format, and will be even more so after this series.

The answer seems obvious – but not to LabourDhananjayan SriskandarajahRachel Reeves has unnecessarily blocked her options of what to include in her budgetFri 7 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 09.59 ESTShareAll the signs suggest that the government will cling to a dangerous set of false choicesat the budgetlater this month. Constrained by the debt and borrowing rules that she has imposed upon herself, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, seems to think she only has three options: take benefits from those who are unable to work; tax those who work and are already struggling to make ends meet; or ask those who don’t need to work to pay a bit more. My worry is that she will not only make the wrong choices, but fail to challenge the dangerous orthodoxies that forced her to see these as the only choices in the first place.Labour’s political rhetoric gives the impression that working people need not worry.Its 2024 election manifestocommitted the party to rebuilding the country so that it “once again serves the interests of working people”. Only a few weeks ago, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, mentioned “working people” no fewer than 17 times in hisconference speech. The chancellor was just behind him, using the phrase on 16 occasionsduring hers.But few thought one of the first things this government would do was go after people unable to work. Labour’sattempted cuts to disability paymentsearlier this year were an effort to re-enact the discredited logic of austerity – cutting support from those who need it most, and undermining our economic health in order to save the Treasury money. Labour’sbackbenchers successfully challengedthe social security cuts, and the chancellor has since recognised the damaging legacy of austerity. Surely it’s time we drew a line under this dangerous economic ideology.The problem is that the government seems unwilling to do anything that could be seen as radical when it comes to taxing those so wealthy they don’t need to work. Starmer has dismissed those who back a wealth tax as “snake-oil merchants”. Still, the chancellor doesn’t seem completely closed to the idea of taxing certain forms of wealth. There are rumours ofcouncil tax reformfor those with the most expensive properties, oran “exit tax”to penalise people who move their wealth out of the country. Both would be positive first steps.Rachel Reeves is damned if she raises income tax in the budget – and damned if she doesn’t | Martin KettleRead moreIt’s worth remembering that taxing wealth isn’t just about raising revenue. It’s also a means of tackling the spiralling inequality that has acorrosive effecton democracy and allowsfor oligarchic concentrationsof political and economic power. Equalising capital gains tax with taxes on income from work would be another important step. Looking to the future, Labour needs to establish an infrastructure that will allow the government to track modern wealth, such as cracking down on tax havens and working with other countries to set a global minimum tax on the ultra-rich, so that future wealth taxes can be precisely designed without loopholes.But with huge pressure from City lawyers, accountants and tax advisers who together form the wealth defence industry, the government will probably be unwilling to go that far. Every time it proposes that the wealthy should contribute more, it’s met with a myth aboutan exodus of the super-richthat would leave working people bearing most of the tax burden. Income tax rises therefore seem the most likely outcome of the budget, including potentially the first increase in thebasic rate of tax for 50 years.This would be economically shortsighted and politically foolish. For one thing, the cost of living remains extortionate. “Stealth taxes”, such as the freeze on income tax thresholds, have continued to bite. Consider that average weekly earnings in August 2007 were £720 in 2025 prices. In August 2025, they were £735. During those intervening 18 years, however, the cost of essentials for working households such as rent, energy bills, transports costs and council tax have increased massively, at higher-than-inflation rates.True, inflation may have dipped compared with the highs after the pandemic, but the highest rates of inflation are stillhitting the poorest hardest. People are feeling worse off because they aremuch worse off.Making them feel even poorer by taxing away a larger portion of their incomes is a recipe for political disaster. In the coming years, the pressures of the climate crisis and our ageing population will require that all of us pay higher taxes. But any government cannot hope to sell these taxes to a population without showing that they are first willing to tax those who hold many times more wealth than the average person.In between talking about working people, Starmer made some fascinating observations in his conference speech, saying that “national renewal isn’t just moving money around, it’s completely rewiring the state and the economy”. That is exactly what we should be doing. But getting there will require breaking free from an unnecessarily narrow and false set of choices.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is trapped in the past, between teachers wedded to their subjects and politicians obsessed with tests. Doctors generally know if they have cured you, lawyers know if you are found not guilty. Educators have only exams to measure theirprofessional success. The result is that English schools cower beneath an examination mountain – a global outlier in terms of the volume of assessment.This week’s reporton reforming the curriculum in England was greeted by conservative critics with cries of wokery,dumbing downand falling standards. My heart sank, until I readits 200 pages. As a former education correspondent, I can only say I found it uplifting. There was the odd reference to diversity but it was hardly “woke”. What shocked me was its outspoken commentary on the existing system, a curriculum that is overly academic and culturally barren, and with teachers treated as robots.The last curriculum reform, 10 years ago, was initiated byMichael Gove. It was refreshing in showing that public policy had a role to play in education. It was less refreshing in prioritising traditional classroom teaching of traditional subjects, a reversion to Dickens’ satire of little pitchers “who were to be filled so full of facts”.The result was a timetable that has steadily been swept clean of extracurricular activities. The arts, music, crafts skills and physical education have been neglected. Familiarity with the world beyond school is ignored. Ofsted ruled all with grades, league tables and humiliation.The reformers refer to what must have been the largest survey of what today’s parents, pupils and employers – not politicians – want from the nation’s schools. It had some 7,000 submissions, surely the first time education’s true users have been granted a say. Above all, their answer was: give us relevance, an education for life, not a test score.Parents wanted children to be given a knowledge of money, law and legal rights, politics and voting, and skill at finding a job and working with others. Only a third of school leavers could recall a single lesson about money that they found useful. What they did remember was “a high volume” of lessons about grammatical concepts such as fronted adverbials. They craved a knowledge of the real world and creativity, and were denied both. The singer Ed Sheeran and a cohort of fellow artistshave welcomed the suggestionthat music and other arts should now become compulsory.At last, an education report has placed a stress on oracy. Gove’s schools were for reading, writing, remembering and shutting up. Today’s children, whose screen addiction leaves ever less time for conversation, need help in expressing themselves clearly. In particular they should know how to articulate their opinions, “listening to others’ points of view, and agreeing and disagreeing respectfully”. I never thought to see that in an education document.It is not dumbing down to demand that children grapple critically with the digital revolution. The report says they must be taught to confront “online harms or misinformation”. They must learn self-defence against a daily bombardment of misinformation from social media and artificial intelligence. This should surely be compulsory.The report is rightly insistent that teenagers should learn about the community in which they live, about its institutions and their own role as engaged citizens. If they are about to vote at 16, they must study politics, to learn “to step confidently into adulthood”. Gove has dismissed such talk as “a rigour-free potpourri of currently fashionable SW1 preoccupations”. He would clearly rephrase Marie Antoinette: let the poor stick to rioting.It is good to see teachers offered “professional autonomy”. The curriculum should be a framework, not a recipe of specific ingredients. The teacher’s task is to bring “the curriculum to life … to reflect their students’ lives and experiences.” It is not to be subservient to an education establishment fanatically resistant to change.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is like Latin in smart schools in the old days. Beyond arithmetic, maths has become a badge of pedagogic irrelevance. I am told the GCSE maths requirement for most technical courses is now a serious barrier to skilled labour training. It is a social segregator. A teacher tells me that, with calculators, all the maths 99% of school leavers need can be taught to them in a day.The only gaping hole in the report is its final preference for “evolution not revolution”. Its stress on citizenship, computing and creativity demands much school time. Yet it offers hardly any. It lacks the guts to abolish GSCEs and it preserves narrow A-levels in a capitulation to university specialism. All it can suggest is a mere 10% cut in hours devoted to exams. That will not do. As long as British schoolchildren remain shackled and enslaved to exams, all other reform will be meaningless.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEducationOpinionEnglandSecondary schoolsExamsMichael GovecommentShareReuse this content"

It’s not grumpy pensioners or vulnerable teenagers – it’s my generationFri 7 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 08.24 ESTShareIf in doubt, we used to talk about the weather. Or if not that, then why the trains were late again, or how sweet someone’s baby was: the kind of routine bland nothings you exchange with strangers on the street. But something about the way we speak in public is changing.A few days ago I was in Aldi, making the usual small talk at the checkout. When the cashier said she was exhausted from working extra shifts to make some money for Christmas, the man behind me chipped in that it would be worse once “she takes all our money” (in case Rachel Reeves was wondering, her budgetpitch-rollingis definitely cutting through). Routine enough, if he hadn’t gone on to add that she and the rest of the government needed taking out, and that there were plenty of ex-military men around who should know what to do, before continuing in more graphic fashion until the queue fell quiet and feet began shuffling. But the strangest thing was that he said it all quite calmly, as if political assassination was just another acceptable subject for casual conversation with strangers, such as football or how long the roadworks have gone on. It wasn’t until later that it clicked: this was a Facebook conversation come to life. He was saying out loud, and in public, the kind of thing people say casually all the time on the internet, apparently without recognising that in the real world it’s still shocking – at least for now.I thought about him when the health secretary, Wes Streeting,voiced alarmthis week that it was becoming “socially acceptable to be racist” again, with ethnic minority NHS staff fighting a demoralising tide of things people now apparently feel emboldened to say to them. What Streeting was describing – not just unabashed racism, but a sense of inhibitions disappearing out of the window more generally – goes well beyond hospital waiting rooms. You can feel it at bus stops, where polite inquiries about why the 44 doesn’t stop here any more end up wheeling off at sudden wild tangents about chemtrails or the government spying on you; or in casual school-gate chats, where otherwise perfectly ordinary-seeming parents turn out to have some very odd ideas about vaccines.A friend calls it “sauna politics”, after the surreally conspiracy-laden conversations she overhears in her local leisure centre sauna. But whatever you want to call it, it’s as if people are suddenly voicing their interior monologues – things that until recently they’d have been embarrassed to say in public, or sometimes even to admit to themselves that they thought – out loud. After all, they can say this stuff online and nobody bats an eyelid. Whynotin a hospital waiting room? It’s the conversational equivalent of young men trying out things they’ve seen in online porn on real-life girlfriends and being surprised when it goes badly – except this time the main culprits are less likely to be confused teenagers than their parents, unmoored by the dizzyingly fast collapse of social norms online and the return of slurs they haven’t heard voiced out loud since childhood.Middle-aged radicalisation sounds almost like a contradiction in terms, a reaction to all the stereotypes about settling comfortably into your rut. Besides, in our own heads, if nowhere else, gen X were always the mild-mannered peacekeepers of the culture wars: not old enough to be deemed reactionary or young enough to be woke, and instead occupying a kind of cheerfully moderate Goldilocks zone in-between. But something seems to have happened to us as we hit the midlife crisis years. Gen Xers are now old enough to start worrying that the world is changing and leaving us behind: that if we get made redundant we might not get hired again, that our marriages may not survive the shock of the kids leaving home, that our views are out of date and someone is out to get us for them, that people are laughing at us behind our backs. Though most of us get through it without a political meltdown, this time of life certainly has its casualties, seeking an outlet for bottled-up rage and disappointment that life hasn’t turned out as planned.It’s gen Xers, not grumpy pensioners or teenage boys beguiled by rightwing influencers, who are powering the populist insurgency now. Only 19% of British fiftysomethingsvoted Reform UKat the last general election buta third of those aged between 50 and 64 woulddo so now, according to YouGov, which is a staggeringly fast turnaround for the “Cool Britannia” generation that put Tony Blair in Downing Street – and key to the party’s move from fringe to mainstream. In the US, gen Xers havebeen dubbedthe “Trumpiest generation”, because they’re more likely than any other to identify as Republican.Yet with rare exceptions such as theSmidge project– a three-year ongoing international study of how conspiracy theories and disinformationspread among45- to 65-year-olds, and how deradicalisation could work for this age group – we show amazingly little curiosity about how middle-aged minds have been shaped by living through the great unregulated free-speech experiment.My generation likes to think we’re above being influenced by what we see online: that we’re more tech-savvy than our parents, less TikTok-addled than our kids, and mature enough to separate it all from real life. But the evidence suggests we’re not nearly as capable of compartmentalising as we think. Perhaps the only surprise, given how thin the fourth wall separating online and offline discourse always was, is that it’s taken this long to break.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Being there for the historic NY mayoral elections this week, I was struck by how abuzz the city was with political energy – not seen since Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign.Mayoral races usually pass unnoticed – yet this one gripped the nation: a contest between the old and new Democratic party, embodied by former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and first-term Queens councillorZohran Mamdani.The race dominated headlines since the improbable rise of Mamdani, a self-described Democratic Socialist, and Cuomo’s shock defeat in the Democratic primary. More than US$90m was spent by candidates and super Pacs – the most expensive race for Gracie Mansion in New York history.So what lessons are there in Mamdani’s win for strategists here in Australia?To examine the ascension of Mamdani and the downfall of Cuomo, you could not find two more contrasting political campaigns.Across the five boroughs it was a contest between the old and new: age, campaign strategy and voting base. It was a battle of David versus Goliath, if Goliath had a string ofsexual harassment allegationshanging over his head.Europeans recognize Zohran Mamdani’s supposedly radical policies as ‘normal’Read moreA clearly unpopular Cuomo dusted off a traditional mainstream, cash-rich playbook of the past 20 years: devoid of any meaningful offering to voters but heavy on traditional television commercials, paid digital advertising, endorsements from labour unions and Democratic leadership, and all paid for by wealthy donors.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailHis cardinal sin was taking his opposition for granted.The opposition came in the form of Mamdani, who built his movement on small-dollar donations and a promise to ease the cost of living in the nation’s most expensive city. His pitch – free bus fares, childcare, rent freeze and cheaper groceries – resonated with younger New Yorkers.Mamdani’s message of economic salvation spread through organic digital content. From Saturday Night Live’s Bowen Yang to model Emily Ratajkowski, popular figures amplified his call for change. His campaign’s storytelling – authentic, shareable and inexpensive – drowned out Cuomo’s multimillion-dollar ad blitz.For political strategists in the US and back home in Australia, it is a blunt lesson: sharable, story-based digital content can beat traditional paid advertising.On the ground, the energy was palpable. New Yorkers hungry for something new poured into the campaign. By election day, the campaign had recruited more than 100,000 volunteers – a grassroots movement that overwhelmed its rivals. Cuomo’s team scrambled to respond, funnelling over US$20m into a last-minute field operation. It was too little, too late. You can’t microwave a ground campaign.For Australian progressives, Mamdani’s victory offers both inspiration and caution. His campaign showed that addressing voters’ daily problems with meaningful ideas, communicated with storytelling and an energised volunteer base, can cut through more powerfully than a stack of paid TV and digital ads.A note to politicians hoping to emulate Mamdani’s social media strategy: without the right policies, it’s pointless | Rohan SathyamoorthyRead moreVoters respond to ideas that are quickly conveyed, simple to understand and just seem to make sense.America’s voluntary voting system makes turnout everything, while in Australia the challenge isn’t getting people to the polls, it’s giving them a reason to care. That same sense of optimism and movement-building can still resonate here, not to drive turnout but to rekindle belief.This is good for democracy.What translates less well is the lure of extreme policy offerings that promise to upend the system entirely. We saw how that kind of politics can backfire, when Donald Trump became a millstone around Peter Dutton’s neck at the last federal election. The lesson for us isn’t to campaign to tear down the system, but to channel that appetite for bold ideas into credible, hopeful reform.

And while he outlines the group’s origins and early development, this takes a back seat to his “youth escapades” in San Francisco, “before the internet, before that city got ruined”. Much of the focus is on his sexual awakening, and how the related secrecy and shame have affected his life. “I was having sex with men when I was very young, 13 or 14,” he says. “It was such a taboo, and that set the tone of my life.” In the memoir, episodes involving his cruising public toilets and parks as a teenager are recounted unflinchingly and unapologetically. “I had sex with older men in bushes,” he writes. “Shamefully at first, proudly later. Fuck off.”“When I do readings, I start with that section,” he says. “I understand how provocative statements like that are; it’s so inappropriate. But I’m not ashamed. With Trump in power, my truth needs to be shouted loud, to combat the racism, the anti-trans and homophobic mindsets.” He pauses. “Iwantto be provocative. I have relatives who are Christian people, and it’s absolutely my intention to ruin their Thanksgiving dinner with this book. Because they’ll all read it.”View image in fullscreen‘Rock bands didn’t have keyboards then’ … Roddy Bottum, right, with Faith No More in 1990.Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty ImagesThe memoir opens on the teenage Bottum relocating from his native Los Angeles. “San Francisco was an abrupt about-face from the sunny superficiality of LA,” he says. “Cold. Dark. People with dyed black hair and white faces, people doing crystal meth and heroin. The queer culture that existed in San Francisco was all so different from Los Angeles. It was inspiring.”It’s here, in 1981, that Bottum joined Faith No Man (later Faith No More) with Billy Gould and Mike Bordin, accenting their “pummelling rhythm section” with “a sense of beauty atop that darkness. Rock bands didn’t have keyboards then.” They cycle through vocalists, including – briefly –Courtney Love, the memoir’s most vivid character, an unabashed chaos agent setting apartments ablaze and making enemies at every turn.“Courtney and I both knew right away that we were soulmates, that we would always be friends,” Bottum says. Their platonic friendship briefly blurred into a sexual relationship, resulting in pregnancy and abortion; later, Bottum became a trusted confidant of Love and her husband,Kurt Cobain. Far from the grunge Lady Macbeth of misogynist legend, Bottum portrays Love as someone with wit, energy and agency.“Courtney had a hard go of it,” he nods. “A controversial woman who’s very powerful, and so smart. And that’s a very attractive, exciting person to write about. She’s a warm, compassionate person, and a lot of people aren’t exposed to that. But we were very close and took care of each other.”The embryonic Faith No More were, Bottum admits, “absolutely preposterous”. Their music centred around repetitive heavy grooves jammed out while under the influence of various drugs, including MDMA, while their frontman, alcoholic oddball Chuck Mosley, “didn’t have a good singing voice”. But they had ambition. “Everyone in our scene was into goth and dark stuff, but we loved MTV, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper. In some crazy way, we imagined we were part of that mix. Though there was nothing shiny or attractive or poptastic about us.”But their sardonic rock-rap anthem We Care a Lot became a minor MTV hit in 1988, Mosley ceded the mic to the photogenic Mike Patton (whodidhave a good singing voice), and by 1990 Faith No More’s third album was a bona fide, Grammy-nominated hit. Characteristically, The Royal We doesn’t dwell on this triumph, jump-cutting instead to their disastrous stint on Guns N’ Roses and Metallica’s 1992 stadium tour.The heroin was me self-medicating, so I could feel OK about living all these secretsIt was, Bottum says, “the biggest tour that had ever happened”. But Faith No More were quickly alienated by the “toxic” rock’n’roll circus they’d clambered aboard; in the memoir, he recounts an unsettling encounter with groupies recruited for GN’R’s entertainment. “The misogyny and the bravado of the macho dynamic coming from the Guns N’ Roses camp was suffocating,” he says. “They had that song One In a Million, with the N word and the F word [faggot], and that was the vibe backstage. I didn’t want any part of it. We didn’t want to loan our credibility, our culture, our individuality to this poison.”The tour – from which Faith No More were sacked two weeks early, for badmouthing GN’R in the press – marked a turning point for Bottum. “I needed to be who I was,” he says, “to talk about being gay, to distance myself from this toxic environment.” Against his managers’ advice, he came out in the pages of the Advocate the following year. “I was the only out queer guy in rock,” he says. “Freddie Mercuryhadn’t come out before he died.Michael Stipedidn’t talk about it, norRob Halford, norBob Mould. It made me angry. I needed to put myself on that page of history, to get people to accept a queer person in music. And I met so many kids who were queer, who felt my being a queer person in music made a difference to them.”Bottum hadn’t even discussed his sexuality with his bandmates, even though he travelled with his boyfriend on the tourbus. “They were open minded, they would have been OK with it,” he says. “It was the damage of being a gay kid in that era, the damage of the shame and homophobia.” He found instant acceptance from Cobain, the Nirvana frontman who was the proud antithesis of the misogyny and homophobia that had blighted the GN’R tour. “Kurt was like a unicorn,” Bottum says softly. “He wanted to be gay – Kurt loved the provocation of that. I think that’s why we were really good friends. He loved that I was gay, that that was a thing he got to be around. He was a very special person.”View image in fullscreen‘I needed to be who I was’ … Roddy Bottum performing at Coachella in 2010.Photograph: Sipa US/AlamyBottum grew close to Cobain and Love, the trio bonded at the time by heroin addiction. Bottum had been struggling to keep his habit under wraps from his bandmates for some time. “It was a drug of secrets, something you did behind closed doors,” he says. “The darkness of heroin had been an attraction to me – putting a needle in your arm is pretty extreme. I didn’t realise its impact on my life, the wreckage it caused to my friends and family.”In 1993, Bottum overdosed in New York. “I died for a moment, and then came back to life,” he remembers. In early 1994, as his father was dying of cancer, he, Love and Cobain made plans to go to rehab together in Long Beach; ultimately, only Bottum made the trip. After several gruelling months, he returned to their house, Love hoping that his newly sober presence might prove a positive influence on Cobain. Bottum stayed in Seattle for a few days, then flew home. A week later, Cobain took his own life.“The first time death happens in a young person’s life is so devastating,” he remembers. “But this was so violent. There had been a gun involved. I couldn’t stop thinking about how that meant the bullet went through his head, and his skull was shattered.”Bottum fell into a deep depression, but his sobriety did not waver. “I felt like, I made it through this. This – Kurt’s death – is what happens. My sobriety was why I was still here, and he was not.” He started a new band, Imperial Teen. “We were queer people, singing about man-to-man relationships,” he says. “And it was only when writing the book I realised: this was my happy ending. The darkness I’d had to pass through was the shame I’d felt. The heroin was me self-medicating, so I could feel OK about living all these secrets. And when I was able to unveil those secrets, everything changed. Imperial Teen was me being honest and open, celebrating my life – a recognition of my acceptance of myself. That’s what got me through.”Bigfoot and me: Roddy Bottum on his avant garde monster operaRead moreThe Royal We closes here, before Faith No More’s split and subsequent reunions (he won’t be drawn on whether they’ll play again), before his detour into movie scoring, beforethe opera he wrote about Sasquatch, which he hopes to turn into a musical. “I’ve always identified with characters like the Elephant Man, or Frankenstein’s monster, or even King Kong,” he says. Does he see any parallel between these tragic creatures with hidden darknesses and himself? He smiles. “I guess I’m just really drawn to a big, ugly monster who had a heart of gold.”The Royal We by Roddy Bottum is published by OutLine Press Ltd, £16.95In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

He was funny, unshakeable and apparently such a fan of the show that he could see several moves ahead of anyone who hunted him. Cat Burns, on the other hand, was an inscrutable unknown. She had no real persona to exploit, and by her own admission had trouble working within large groups, so she was always destined to fly under the radar.View image in fullscreenA gleeful traitor … Carr bumps off Celia – to her face.Photograph: BBCMeanwhile, the moment he was picked as a traitor, Alan Carr started twitching and hyperventilating, his eyes darting around the room like nobody’s business. At first he seemed destined to flame out like Linda from the third civilian Traitors series; a lovely woman who was so genetically incapable of keeping any form of secret that she effectively self-immolated at the earliest opportunity.But then The Celebrity Traitors did something really smart. Very early on it asked the traitors to murder a faithful in clear sight, by touching them on the face. While the other two demurred, Carr stepped up, sealing the fate of Paloma Faith for good by wiping an invisible hair off her cheek. The fact that he killed so early – and that his victim was one of his closest friends, no less – emboldened him beyond words. Before long, he took on the mantle of traitor ringleader, impatient to off as many people as he could.View image in fullscreenThe veteran, the unknown and (centre) the ringleader.Photograph: BBCViewed in the clear light of day, this is monstrous behaviour. From one angle, the story of Alan Carr is the story of a man who was given a tiny amount of power then went wild with bloodlust. It’s a pantomime retelling of theStanford Prison Experiment. But the thing that made Carr such an incredible traitor is that he managed to temper all this with an entire bucket of charm.The prevailing theory among the faithfuls this year was that of the Big Dog; in essence, that if a show has the pulling power to book people as famous as Jonathan Ross and Stephen Fry, then it would be logical to assume that they would be traitors. The Big Dog Theory did for both Ross (correctly) and Fry (incorrectly) in time, while Carr avoided scrutiny altogether. This is because very little about him is outwardly aggressive. While everyone was hunting the Big Dogs, Carr was utilising the Little Puppy Theory, and winning in spades.Who is Joe Marler? From hair-raising rugby antics to breakout star of Celebrity TraitorsRead moreBut let’s have a little perspective here. Carr didn’t win just because he was a good traitor. He also won because the faithfuls were collectively the most inept group of people ever to grace a television screen. This was a game with three traitors, and it took the faithfuls seven episodes to even find one. Statistically, they would have done a better job by writing everyone’s name on some sticky notes, then playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey.Stories will be told about exactly how useless the faithfuls were this year, about how Kate Garraway and David Olusoga evaporated all the authority they’d built up over decades in the business by pursuing the stupidest line of inquiry at every turn. These are people who failed to catch Carr, even when he failed to say the words “I am a faithful” without dissolving into nervous giggles. They are fools, one and all.So Alan Carr was always going to win The Celebrity Traitors. But he did so with such joy, such total effervescence, that he deserves to go down in history. Good luck topping that next year.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsAlan CarrTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He made reference to it from the stage, with the kind of twinkle that made this audience member think: “Ooh, I’ll bet he gets far in it!” Which would be no surprise: as well as being a comedian, Mohammed has been performing feats of magic, memory and mental acuity on stage for years. A sharp intelligence with a very unassuming demeanour: surely this is just the sort to prosper on TV’s most popular game of deception, detection and under-the-radar un-puzzling?Who knew that – far from winning the thing – Mohammed would enter Traitors lore, in a finale for the ages, as the man who threw it all away, snatching defeat from the jaws of bezzie-mates glory with his fellow “hundie”, the rugby player Joe Marler? Either way, Mohammed – for years an act I referred to as “comedy’s best kept secret” – has had his breakout moment, a fabulously funny man who’s become a household name in the least likely fashion. That is especially satisfying to those who’ve followed his work since the early 2010s, when Mohammed emerged on the roster’s of the UK’s hippest comedy agency – but never fitted in there, and frankly, has seldom fitted in elsewhere either.View image in fullscreenBumptious alter ego … David Elms, Nick Mohammed and Kieran Hodgson in Mr Swallow: Houdini at the Edinburgh fringe in 2016.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianThat agency wasthe Invisible Dot, the same stable that gave us Tim Key. It specialised in achingly cool and offbeat standup for the graduate set –“a type of comedy which I don’t always find funny,”a rather un-collegiate Mohammed told me in 2015. His sympathies were always more mainstream: he cited as his inspirationSome Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em, French & Saunders, and, er, the ice skaters Torvill and Dean. How on earth was this man (fresh from his PhD studies in seismology, of all things) going to fit into modern comedy?He carved a niche with a series of shows more or less in character as his bumptious alter ego Mr Swallow, a camp northern know-all nowin character as Houdini, performing extraordinary feats of escapology; and elsewhere (flanked by sidekicks David Elms and Kieran Hodgson) as the lead ina spoof Dracula musical. Alongside these, a series of simpler shows, in which PowerPoint, conjuring and camp character comedy combined to seductive but somewhat evasive effect. WhowasMr Swallow? Mohammed never explained it. WhowasNick Mohammed? He almost never performed entirely as himself.View image in fullscreenNick Mohammed as Mr Swallow.Photograph: Matt CrockettAll the while, he was becoming a familiar if discreet TV face – on shows such as Miranda and Stath Lets Flats, and inhis own cybercrime sitcom Intelligence, co-starring David Schwimmer. Videos of his contributions to 8 Out of 10 Cats went viral – such as the one in which hesets words to the theme tune of the movie Jurassic Park. Mohammed’s profile rocketed, though, with the success of fish-out-of-water football comedy Ted Lasso, in which he starred as the meek kit man turned malevolent rival manager Nate.But until The Celebrity Traitors, the 45-year-old’s transition from sitcom success to national treasure was proving a bumpy one. An appearance at the 2024 Bafta awards ceremony went badly askew (“Bafta viewers cringe,” ran the headlines, “as Mr Swallow skit leaves crowd looking confused”), and a major West End run of his Charles Dickens spoof A Christmas Carol(ish) fell foul of a disastrous opening night, which collapsed in tears and awkwardness after repeated technical failures.How satisfying, then, that this most idiosyncratic of artists (part Renaissance man, part shapeshifter) has now carved himself a niche in the public’s affections – and by improbable means, too, which was the only way he was ever likely to do so. The fascinating thing, for comedy-watchers, will be to see what effect this all has on Mohammed’s live work. Show Pony, which is still touring, is a sensational experience, partly because, for the first time in his career, something of the “real” Mohammed peeks out, very playfully, from behind Mr Swallow’s mask – to address (again, for the first time) his race, his background, his career standing.Ted Lasso’s Nick Mohammed: ‘I didn’t think about comedy seriously until doing a PhD in seismology’Read moreTo Mohammed uninitiates, I can’t recommend that show highly enough. He may be worried, as Ed Gamble reported on Traitors Uncloaked, that “everyone’s going to hate me” after betraying his bromance with Marler and scuppering the Faithful’s prospects on TV on Thursday. But for audiences who’ve followed his career, and who see Show Pony, that couldn’t be further from the truth. We love Mohammed: he’s a wonderful entertainer, and his newfound prominence is richly deserved.Nick Mohammed: Show Ponyis on tour from 8-11 November and 9 April-20 JuneExplore more on these topicsComedyThe TraitorsMagicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Where do the Star Trek movies go from here?Ben ChildOne of the new Paramount ownership’s first acts has been to end the Chris Pine/Zachary Quinto series of Trek movies. But surely they can’t stop making them forever?Fri 7 Nov 2025 08.52 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 12.48 ESTShareThere have been many Star Treks over the decades. First up we had a 1960s morality play performed on cardboard sets; then it became a billion-dollar movie saga about space diplomacy. More recently we’ve been gifted an ever-expanding collection of streaming spinoffs, each one more determined than the last to prove itself the true keeper of the sacred flame. Now we have a franchise that no longer has any idea what to do with itself.According to Variety, its producer Paramount has shelved the most recent film trilogy, known unofficially as the “Kelvin-verse”, that starred Chris Pine as Kirk and Zachary Quinto as Spock. What comes next is anyone’s guess.Perhaps the more pertinent question here might be whether this grand old sci-fi saga is now really suited for the big screen at all. The recent films – 2009’sStar Trek, 2013’sStar Trek Into Darkness, and 2016’sStar Trek Beyond– won critical plaudits, yet were also criticised by fans for trying to turn a utopian thought experiment about empathy, cooperation and the perils of militarism into a knockabout space opera.The JJ Abrams-led trilogy was well acted, usually well-plotted (apart from the odd moment of Khan-related identity crisis in the middle movie) and featured some spectacular set pieces: the segue in which Kirk and his crew blow up a squadron of enemy drones to the soundtrack of the Beastie Boys’ Sabotage has few equals in modern blockbuster cinema. And yet here we are, 16 years on, and with not much to show for it other than a stack of unused sequel scripts –Kirk’s dad being inexplicably alive was briefly considered.On the small screen, Kirk and Spock are not even played by Pine and Quinto any more, as the Paramount+ sagaStrange New Worldsharks back unapologetically to the early, Apollo-era optimism of the 1960s original series. (In fact, Kirk isn’t even the captain of the Enterprise yet). Could Strange New Worlds eventually transition to the big screen? It’s more than possible, and the series has cleverly blended Shatner-era earnestness with modern streaming swagger. And yet it’s hard to imagine a show whose best moments include Spock accidentally getting engaged during shore leave and a full musical episode set entirely in space making the leap to cinema without losing something in the process.Personally I love the show, but trying to shoehorn its gentle emotional chaos into 120 minutes of blockbuster spectacle could be counterproductive. So where else could Paramount look?Variety’s report hangs heavily on the supposed political power shift at the studio, which has seen Top Gun: Maverick II, Call of Duty: The Movie and even a sequel to Days of Thunder being mooted, as new Trump-ally CEO David Ellison looks toward greenlighting the kind of material that red-state America adores. That approach doesn’t seem to make any sense at all forStar Trek, which made history for the first interracial kiss on mainstream US television and has been optimistically “woke” ever since. It’s hard to see how that sits beside a studio slate obsessed with fighter jets and militaristic patriotism.The truth is that Star Trek always represented a quiet form of rebellion. It was always obsessed with the joys of interstellar coexistence and the power of cosmic diplomacy, turning moral quandaries and sentient holograms demanding civil rights into primetime drama. Yet the very optimism that once made the saga radical now appears to have made it politically unfashionable. It’s the final irony: the one franchise that still believes in the future can’t find a future for itself.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekStar Trek (Culture)Star Trek (Film)Star Trek Into DarknessTelevisioncommentShareReuse this content"

The first part airs on 27 November, but a clip of the chilling opening five minutes has been shared online.The episode, The Crawl, takes fans back to the start of the series in 1983, after the disappearance of Will Byers (Noah Schnapp).“Should I stay or should I go?” Will sings as he tries to keep calm in the Upside Down. Things quickly become terrifying when a demogorgon appears and drags Will to the lair of Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). “At long last, we can begin,” he tells Will while shooting a vine down his throat. “You and I, we are going to do such beautiful things together.”The second part of the concluding series will air on Boxing Day, with the final episode out on New Year’s Day – which will also be screened in select cinemas.The synopsis reads: “The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. But he has vanished – his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming – and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone – the full party – standing together, one last time.”The surprise clip was uploaded to YouTube after the show’s Los Angeles premiere on Thursday, which was attended by cast members including Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour.“The scale of it is bigger … It’s more action and more special effects, but it’s also by far the most emotional season because it’s the end of the story for all of these characters,” the series’ co-creator, Matt Duffer, recently said of the final episodes.Ross Duffer, his brother and co-creator, added: “Bringing it out in the world is nerve-racking, but we’re ready to finally show it.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionStranger ThingsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, she is reworking Dickens’s classic – with an Asian ScroogeFri 7 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 09.14 ESTShareTo begin with, Gurinder Chadha was wandering through theCharles DickensMuseum in London, trying to commune with the author’s spirit. “If you were alive today,” the film-maker asked him, “what story would you tell?” And, she wondered in the same breath: “What can I bring as my own vision to this wonderful story of yours?”While Dickens’s ghost didn’t materialise, she found her answers and, during lockdown, wrote her own version of his ghost story A Christmas Carol. Giving it the title Christmas Karma, the 65-year-old Londoner has created an energetic, flamboyant musical film starring The Big Bang Theory’s Kunal Nayyar as Mr Sood – her modern-day Scrooge – alongside Eva Longoria, Billy Porter and Boy George as the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. The rest of the cast is stacked like decorations on a Norway spruce, with Hugh Bonneville, Danny Dyer and Pixie Lott further illuminating proceedings.With the kind of coincidence Dickens revelled in, the film-maker switched on the TV news to find inspiration for the miser who drains the joy from everyone around him. “There’s an interesting phenomenon of Asians in the Tory party empowered by taking a hard rightwing stance,” Chadha says. “In a way it’s them wanting to be accepted more – which is kind of what my Scrooge does. He thinks money will give him status and protect him. People would ask me to come and support them, and I would say: ‘No, I can’t. Even though you’re an Asian woman and I’m an Asian woman, that’s where it stops.’”View image in fullscreenIn the spirit … Danny Dyer and Gurinder Chadha on the set of Christmas Karma.Photograph: True BritIt makes you wonder whether those politicians, whom Chadha won’t mention by name, had ever actually seen any of her eight feature films, which have been gently – and sometimes riotously – dismantling stereotypes since 1993. “My stories say we all have varied cultural leanings and are empowered by different things,” she says.Born in Kenya to Indian Sikh parents, Chadha was two when civil unrest led the family to move to Britain in the 1960s. “I never lived in India, so Southall is my home town,” she says of the west London enclave, where she witnessed the myriad perspectives fracturing the so-called Asian community. That would feed into her films: her debut, Bhaji on the Beach – about a women’s outing to Blackpool – sees the day-trippers clash over what counts as “respectable behaviour”. InViceroy’s House, Hindus, Muslims and Sikh workers split along political as much as religious lines. InBlinded By the Light, as in her best-known filmBend It Like Beckham, the central conflict is not East v West but fathers and their children.The long entanglement between Britain and India shapes the way Chadha thinks about identity today. “My storytelling doesn’t start in modern day London; it began hundreds of years ago with Queen Elizabeth I granting the East India Company a monopoly to go to India, where British immigrants began the economic plunder that fuelled industrial Britain – telling the truth of that part of Britishness shaped by the diaspora.”If you put a person of colour in the lead in a British film, 90% of the industry backs awayConsequently, having Asian leads in adaptations of It’s a Wonderful Life (It’s a Wonderful Afterlife), Pride and Prejudice (Bride and Prejudice) and now Dickens feels entirely natural: “To see a character you don’t expect in that setting is to open up the world – and that story – in new ways.”On an overcast summer’s day, I visit the Christmas Karma set, on location in a picturesque street in Camden Town, north London, witnessing the pivotal moment when her Scrooge – or Sood – glimpses the Cratchits’ Christmas table and overhears what the ailing Tiny Tim really thinks of him. What the Dickens prose never accounted for was this: a gay African American Ghost of Christmas Present in a sparkly emerald three-piece suit; Bob Cratchit (Leo Suter) leading his wife Mary (Pixie Lott) in a guitar-led ballad; and a director crouched on a narrow staircase, eyes darting between the monitor and the mayhem. “That scene was tough for Kunal,” she says when we speak later. “You can’t have Sood soften too soon – one misplaced smile at the end of a line can ruin the journey.”Capturing the right mood drives the film-maker, especially in today’s divided Britain. She notes that Dickens is widely believed today to have had bipolar disorder and would have been “destroyed by the disparity between the wealthy and poor”, she explains. “He’s trying to figure out why people can be mean and selfish.” While editing the film she was struck by a line where the Ghost of Christmas Present asks: “Is one CEO worth a thousand Tim Cratchits?” Even though it wasn’t intended as a direct allusion, “I thought, people will assume I mean Elon Musk and the rise of the [tech] CEOs,” she says.View image in fullscreenWhat the Dickens … a scene from Christmas Karma.Photograph: True BritGathering a cast of this magnitude would be like Christmas for most British film-makers, but such is Chadha’s global stature that actors dream up ways of catching her eye. Eva Longoria invited her to host a screening ofFlamin’ Hot, her own directorial debut. Over dinner, the Desperate Housewives star told Chadha she’d love to work with her, and Chadha told her about Christmas Karma. Longoria was adamant that she should be a ghost. “She said: ‘I’m Mexican – we own ghosts. Day of the Dead. Hello?’” Chadha says it was a lightbulb moment; she went home and rewrote the part, finding a British mariachi band to back her up.The emphasis in Chadha’s films – and in the way she carries herself off camera – is always on fun, which is perhaps why the British film industry underrates her. In the past 30 years, only Steve McQueen, as a British director of colour, has been as consistent or as successful. Bend It Like Beckham was released in every country in the world. “Even North Korea,” she chimes. Yet, like Nancy Meyers in the US – another film-maker who makes popular, female-centric movies – she often finds herself underappreciated and condescended to.“Whatever they see me as, I don’t see myself as that,” Chadha says of British film executives. “The amount of money I’ve made for the British film industry is enormous. People want me to make bleeding-heart films about suffering Asian women and racism. I could make searingly political films, but who’s going to watch them? People who read Sight and Sound? Another reason my films aren’t taken seriously is that people don’t value women. I show the world from a female perspective – and women come up to me in tears, saying my films meant so much to them growing up.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

By the end, he said: ‘You know what, I want to help Gurinder and people like Gurinder.’ And he did. Afterwards, people looked at me differently. Producer Andy Paterson still says: ‘Oh my God, that speech.’” When we speak, she’s on her way to India as part of a trade mission aimed at strengthening Britain’s ties with the country.Is the world Chadha depicts in her movies under threat from the rise of Reform UK, with its mantra that immigration is out of control, British culture has been eroded, and the country has become hostage to wokeness? She dismisses the notion. “Reform are a minority; we have to remember that,” she says. “While I understand the idea of trying to protect your cultural identity, there’s no room for hatred or racism from anyone, on any side, of any colour.”Rather, she sees the climate as an opportunity for her diaspora-centred movies. “There are enough people unhappy with what’s happening politically who will find the film a soothing balm,” she says. “One reason Bend It Like Beckham was so popular was that it came out after 9/11. The world was traumatised and unsure where to turn – then came this sweet, innocent film celebrating different cultures.” She sent the internet into raptures recently with the announcement that she’s working on a sequel to that most beloved of football films. “With the rise of women’s football, I’ve been persuaded to revisit the story and imagine what they’d all be doing today,” she teases.Her creative team already has a star consultant in the shape of the United States and former Chelsea Women’s manager Emma Hayes. “We went for a curry the other day – she’s from Camden, where I live,” Chadha recalls. “It started with her fangirling me when we first met, saying she was Keira Knightley and cried her eyes out when the film ended. Now I’m talking to her about the business side of football, about the struggles and successes she’s had. I’m doing my due diligence.“It’s so loved I don’t want to do any old shit,” she adds. “Unless I have something to say, I won’t say it.”Christmas Karma is in UK cinemas from14 November.Explore more on these topicsGurinder ChadhaCharles DickensinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He and star Smith talk Kylie regrets, bad dads … and how to do a strip club scene with a nine-year-oldShaad D'SouzaFri 7 Nov 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 11.35 ESTShareNick Cave claims that at least four different production companies have tried to turn his frequently hilarious, always disturbing, sex-filled novel The Death of Bunny Munro into a film or TV show in the 16 years since its release. The problem? “No one would play the character!” he says, sitting, impeccably suited as always, in a room at London’s Corinthia Hotel. As it turns out, the material was just waiting for the right actor. Step upMatt Smithto play the titular sex-addicted travelling makeup salesman.It’s not surprising that it ended up being Smith. Since his Doctor Who days, he has tended to pick roles that trend slightly twisted – and the role of Bunny, who in Cave’s book is depicted as a borderline animalistic misogynist who sweats pure ethanol, fits the bill entirely. “I think it’s important to tell stories that feel challenging and difficult and polarising, and I thought this would be all of those things,” Smith says animatedly, clad in head-to-toe black in contrast with Bunny’s rakish suit. “But actually, at its heart, it’s about a father and son, and it’s really beautiful.”First published in 2009 – after initially being written as a film script for Australian director John Hillcoat – The Death of Bunny Munro follows a sex-obsessed salesman who, after driving his wife to suicide through his constant infidelity, kidnaps his bookish son (played brilliantly by Rafael Mathé) when social services attempt to take him away, and brings him on a surreal road trip around Sussex.The book is defined by Bunny’s shocking inner monologue and seemingly amoral view of the world; the Sky adaptation, directed by Isabella Eklöf and written by Pete Jackson, presents a slightly toned-down take. A lot of the sex is conveyed through sound and dialogue; some moments from the book, such as Bunny’s rape of a woman who is under the influence of heroin – a scene for which Cave was nominated for theBad Sex award– are implied rather than depicted in lurid detail. This results in a slightly more sympathetic Bunny, though he is still an undeniable creep, willing to abandon his child for long spells to seduce bored housewives, and intent on teaching his son how to be a lech.View image in fullscreen‘I changed every swear word to frig or flip or sugar’ … Bunny Munro (Matt Smith) and Bunny Junior (Rafael Mathé).Photograph: Sarah Weal/Sky UK, Clerkenwell FilmsBeing set in 2003, the show is also an endearing period piece, filled with clunky Nokias and classic Kylie tracks blaring out of car radios. Smith says he feels the show is “a really faithful adaptation”, though he acknowledges that the book, which is mired in Bunny’s almost free-associative thoughts about women, was incredibly tricky to film. “The pollution of his thoughts, and the danger of his thoughts, are really difficult to translate to a character that you’re going to stick with,” he says.Bunny’s uniqueness, though, was fundamentally appealing. “I thought the language of the book was beautiful – I read it quite quickly, and I was like: ‘Wow,fuck.This is gonna be a challenge, because he’s pretty out there, but what a great challenge.’ I’d rather do that than something that feels predictable,” says Smith. “He’s quite an operatic character – he’s out there and does mad shit – and they’re the ones that I’m drawn to, otherwise we’re just left with this homogenised, dumbed-down nonsense where no one pushes it too far. This felt really original.”Although Smith declines to identify what he deems “dumbed-down nonsense”, he does elaborate: “I think we have a tendency to overexplain and try to predict people’s tastes in telly sometimes,” he says. “‘Let’s make it so everyone likes it,’ you know? Some people will like this, some people won’t – I’m totally fine with that.”Cave feels that Smith’s version of Bunny Munro is “more transgressive than my version, because my version is just a lost individual and a terrible person, and he’s not attractive and he’s not good at what he does.” Smith, on the other hand? “The problem with Matt is that he’s handsome and sexy, and that makes the whole thing slightly more dubious, because he’s doing the same things,” says Cave. “But women actually like it in the show – you can see the sort of pulling power that he has, and I find that more discomfiting in a way. There’s something about the fact that Matt is hot that is quite problematic.”View image in fullscreenAll ears … Matt Smith as Bunny Munro.Photograph: Sky UK, Clerkenwell FilmsMathé, who plays Bunny’s nine-year-old son Bunny Jr, is one of the highlights of The Death of Bunny Munro, holding his own even when paired with the go-for-broke Smith. Smith says that working with a child actor on such explicit material was an eye-opening experience for him. “We were really lucky in that we had a brilliant young actor in Raf, who’s smart and understood the emotional complexity of the story, even at such a young age,” he says. “You have to be careful about what you reveal to him – so, for instance, you shoot the scene in the strip joint with the beers and strippers and the naked people first, and then he comes in, and he doesn’t see any of that.”He continues: “So you’re shooting two sides of a coin all the time. And then I would swear on my takes, and on his takes, I’d say the word frig or flip or sugar. It was the first time I’ve ever been in a story where children have had to witness that level of depravity, and you’ve got to be conscious that he’s nine years old,” he says. “Even if it is a story, you don’t want to expose him too early to things he shouldn’t be anywhere near. But his parents were amazing, and they navigated that whole thing beautifully – we really looked after him. Without him, there’d be no show really.”The Death of Bunny Munro is, in some senses, a morality tale – a tragedy about a man whose appetites, and inability to care for his family, eventually send him to ruin. Around the time of the book’s release, Cave said he was inspired by a certain kind of British man who’s “laddish, sex-obsessed, thinks that breasts are kind of funny”, and that he wanted to show where that kind of misogyny could lead. Cave says he doesn’t “really relate to that quote any more. I don’t stand in judgment of Bunny Munro any more. I just have a different way of seeing people, and part of that is that we are essentially broken, all of us, to lesser or greater degrees,” he says. “I think we live in a time where there’s a feeling that we should be condemning the transgressive personality wherever we see it, and I find that personally quite difficult to do.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I recognise a lot of different men in him,” he says. “He’s a really complicated, deeply troubled, sad human being. He’s in the nexus of this tornado of grief.”Now is the perfect time for a Bunny Munro series, says Cave, because of that feeling. “I think the world is hungry for things that step outside the expectations of our culture these days – I just get the feeling that people are looking at ways to test the puritanical nature of our present culture,” he says. “Especially with young people – I’m surrounded by young people because I have kids in their early 20s, and they’re much looser and freer about things these days, and they take a certain pride in that. I think that’s good, as far as I’m concerned – that encourages a more healthy, artistic, free society.”The Bunny Munro book was considered controversial on its release, in part because of the sexually charged, objectifying way Bunny fixates on Kylie Minogue and Avril Lavigne. Cave ended up apologising to both women on BBC 6Music, although he says “that may have been tongue in cheek. I never met Avril Lavigne, and I hope she isn’t really offended, or was not embarrassed by that – I would really hate that. I hope she wasn’t upset – maybe she just thought it was funny,” he says. “I know Kylie, I asked Kylie what she thought, and she was like: ‘Well, I’ve actually not read your book yet.’ And this went on for years. She says: ‘It’s next to my bed, but I haven’t got around to it.’ So I don’t know if she ever really read it, but I guess she still likes me.”The pure transgression of Bunny as a character – which led to such controversy after the novel was published – is what attracted Smith to the role in the first place, and why he’s thrilled he got to play him. “It’s always been hard to find parts like Bunny Munro; they’re rare, really rare. That’s the type of stuff I’ve always been interested in,” he says. “I remember all that in-your-face theatre in the 90s, I used to love all that. There was something about it that’s appalling … but it made me sit on the edge of my seat. That’s what Bunny can do.”The Death of Bunny Munro is on Sky Atlantic on20 November.The Death of Bunny Munro by Nick Cave (Canongate Books, £9.99).

He and Reeves, his longtime friend and most righteous co-star of the Bill & Ted movies, had the idea for the revival three years ago and have been prepping ever since.View image in fullscreenAnthony Carrigan, Kaya Scodelario and Josh Gad in Adulthood.Photograph: Albert Camicioli/Signature EntertainmentAnd yet, on stage for the first time since he was a teenager, the 60-year-old actor had a moment of panic. “I was like: ‘Oh, holy shit! What if I’m wrong?” he says, perched on a velvet sofa in a lounge at the theatre, a few hours before he goes on again. “And I’m looking at Keanu, who’s in a similar state of terror. And – well, it would have worried me if either of us were like, ‘whatever.’”The show, of course, went on. Winter and Reeves, the beloved time-travelling slackers of yore reunited as befuddled buddies in timeless purgatory, are now a third of the way through their 16-week run. Winter looks relaxed, sipping tea, in a blue scarf, at once garrulous and introspective. He’s in favour of people feeling the precipitous fear of creative risk a little more. “One hundred percent. There should be a jumping-out-of-an-airplane [feeling] without, you know, jumping out of an airplane.”I know I can trust Keanu and he can trust me. There’s no bullshitWinter would know. As well as a return to Broadway, this season brings the release ofAdulthood, his first film as director in over a decade. (He also appears in the black comedy as a weirdo stoner.) A child actor turned movie star turned director and producer and prolific tech documentarian, Winter’s career has been fitful, searching and unconventional, full of sharp left turns and voracious curiosity. (On Godot, the New Yorker’s Helen Shawreported, accurately, that Winter’s “palpable intelligence drives the show.”) Returning to Broadway, where he made his debut at age 13, is a bit like closing a loop. “I’ve lived like three lifetimes since then. But now being backstage and doing my warm-ups, being in the wings and seeing the stagehands – it feels like I never left. It’s like a complete time-bend.”Waiting for Godot review – Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter’s unlikely reunionRead moreOne that is shared with Reeves, theeccentric, thoughtful yinto Winter’s quick and chatty yang, a “lifesaver” with whom Winter most recently appeared on-screen inBill & Ted Face the Music(2020). “I knew that this was a mammoth undertaking, and the only reason I felt we could pull it off was that it was the two of us together,” he says. Working with Reeves provides “an immediate sense of comfort. I know I can trust him and he can trust me. We genuinely have each other’s backs. There’s no bullshit.”View image in fullscreenAlex Winter (left) as Vladimir and Keanu Reeves as Estragon in Waiting for Godot, in New York.Photograph: Andy Henderson/APReeves and Winter, with ever-precise comic timing and inimitable chemistry, are the leaven in this bleak existentialist affair, lending lines such as “together again at last …” a jolt of sweetness – and indulging in a flourish of air guitar. Indeed, Winter says, performing with Reeves again “is like being in a band.” (The two both play bass.) “It’s this fluid give-and-take. Sometimes I’m cooking and he’s catching up. Sometimes I’m catching up and he’s cooking. Sometimes we’re helping each other out of a hole. Sometimes we’re just on a fucking groove and we look at each other and go: ‘God damn, that was good! Where the fuck did that come from?’”Vladimir and Estragon, two longtime friends with a vaudeville past, share qualities with the duo – particularly a “questioning of faith and life” – that have drawn them together since their early 20s. “We were both really into literature and drama, but also just like, what the fuck is this world? How do you live in it?” Winter laughs. How do you maintain artistic integrity and have a Hollywood career? How do you keep having fun? And, after the success of Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure in 1989, how do you be famous?By this point, Winter had already been acting over half his life. Born in England to two modern dancers, he first got on stage at age 10 in St Louis, Missouri; when he, aged 12, and his mother moved to New York following divorce, she got him a children’s talent agent. Within a month, he was on Broadway opposite Yul Brynner in The King and I. He spent most of his high school years in Peter Pan, playing John Darling next to Sandy Duncan.View image in fullscreenWinter in Joel Schumacher’s The Lost Boys (1987).Photograph: Jane O’Neal/Warner Bros/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockHere, he developed the trademark discipline of a child actor – a subject he later explored in his 2020 documentary Showbiz Kids – and lasting emotional scars from prolonged sexual abuse by an unnamed adult who, he says, has since died. The “nightmarish” experience, which he did notrevealpublicly until 2018, left him with “extreme PTSD” and mental fracturing that, as hetoldthe Guardian in 2020, got “worse and worse and worse.”He didn’t talk about it and kept working, – first an off-Broadway play, then commercials, then NYU film school, then an audition for Joel Schumacher’s vampire drama The Lost Boys. The director encouraged him to drop out. The part was small, but the movie, released in 1987, “totally changed my life”. A year short of graduation, he moved to LA.View image in fullscreenAir guitar at the ready … Winter and Reeves in Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure (1989).Photograph: Orion/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockBy the time Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey sequel was released in 1991, Winter had already shifted focus, directing music videos and commercials and co-creating the Idiot Box, a late-night sketch series for MTV. In 1993, he co-wrote and co-directed the cult hit Freaked, in which he played a former child star who is kidnapped and turned into a mutant by Randy Quaid. By 26, he was “fried.” Winter dismissed his agents and decamped for New York, then London, where he formed a production company. “I just wanted to get the hell out of the public eye, and just be on the tube, going to my office in Soho and start a family,” he says. He found a therapist, and started confronting the trauma of abuse. He had three children, the youngest of whom is about to graduate high school in LA.And he began pursuing rangy nonfiction interests as a documentarian – firstNapster, the download site that revolutionised the consumption of music; then Bitcoin and the dark web; then the Panama Papers, Blockchain and the iconoclastic musicianFrank Zappa. His most recent documentary, 2022’s The YouTube Effect, traced the video sharing platform’s arc from cute novelty to conspiracy theory machine. “My career is where I want it, which is that I have the ability to do whatever interests me the most,” he notes sagely. “But I would not have been OK had I not split.”Adulthood, which Winter co-produced from a script by Michael MB Galvin, brings some of Winter’s prevailing concerns back into the realm of metaphor: two siblings, manchild Noah (Josh Gad) and strait-laced Megan (Kaya Scodelario), discover a literal skeleton in their parents’ basement, triggering a deadly spiral of bad decisions fuelled by fear of financial and reputational ruin. The film, says Winter, “is at heart about the unrelenting and unspoken impossibility of living in this culture today” and the “fallacy of the middle class” in countries, such as the US and the UK, that are actively hollowing it out.Winter has never been shy about his political affiliations. Earlier this year, he helped organise anti-MuskTesla Takedown protests– and is quick to tie the siblings’ absurd hijinks back to the larger US climate. In Adulthood, “stress can subtly shift you into immoral acts, which is very much about the times that we’re in, where people who were Bernie bros suddenly went Maga,” he says. The very online, pathetic Noah draws, in part, on Winter’s experience in the bowels of YouTube. “Having been around so many fanboy-type people because of my work, I feel like I know them very well,” he says. “I don’t have contempt for them, but I do think they need to grow up.”View image in fullscreenWinter (bottom left) and Jonathan Ward watch Sandy Duncan fly across the stage in a performance of Peter Pan in the 1970s.Photograph: Diana Walker/Getty ImagesWinter, long a chronicler of the internet’s maturation, now has his sights trained on AI. “I’ve been thinking about an AI doc for about five years, and it hasn’t been the right time because it’s moving so fast,” he says. During the writers’ and actors’ strikes, held in part over AI protections, Winter acted as an interlocutor of sorts, running Zoom consortiums for guild members with AI technologists, academics, copyright lawyers and patent experts. “Most of the criticism is really fucking dumb,” he says, “like people who are out there saying, ‘I’m a leader in the anti-AI charge, and we have to create this law or that’, and they just have no idea what they’re talking about and none of it is ever going to work.”He is not anti-regulation, more pro accurate and clear information, and certainly anti-huckster. “There’s a lot of smart people in this space,” with “good morals,” he says. (This does not, he notes, include OpenAI’s Sam Altman.) But “the reality of it is there will be an enormous amount of carnage on the way to things being OK. In every area, from Hollywood to climate to journalism, people are getting fired all over the place. They’re not getting replaced by a robot. They’re just not getting replaced.”Economic stress, job displacement, the rightward shift toward authoritarianism to solve the problems it can’t and won’t fix – it’s an old cycle, now playing out again, that brings us back to Godot, based in part on Beckett’s experience in the French resistance during the second world war. Winter returns to a question posed by Estragon in act I – “We’ve no rights any more?” – as the duo submit to waiting for no one. Vladimir answers: “We got rid of them.”“Every night, I say that line to Keanu: ‘We got rid of our rights,’” says Winter ruefully. “We were fucking idiots. We did it again.” And, as ever, the show goes on.Adulthood is available on digital platforms from 17 NovemberExplore more on these topicsFilmKeanu ReevesArtificial intelligence (AI)US politicsSexual harassmentChildreninterviewsShareReuse this content"

She had already starred in the one-woman play in the West End and Broadway.Photograph: Paramount/Kobal/ShutterstockMoviesObituaryPauline Collins obituaryActor who earned an Oscar nomination for portraying Shirley Valentine, a dissatisfied housewife who sets off on a romantic quest in GreeceAnthony HaywardFri 7 Nov 2025 10.15 ESTLast modified on Fri 7 Nov 2025 12.32 ESTShareThe actor Pauline Collins, who has died aged 85 after suffering from Parkinson’s disease, had a habit of moving from one role to another but will for ever be remembered for two parts – a parlourmaid in the 1970s masters-and-servants TV drama Upstairs Downstairs, at the mercy of her employers, and a woman very much in control of her own life in Willy Russell’s stage and film comedy Shirley Valentine.“Too much security makes me nervous, afraid of missing all the surprises just below the horizon,” she once remarked. “One of the terrors of a little success is the possibility of losing the ability to dare, to jump off the cliff.”The biggest spotlight shone on Collins when she starred as the bored Liverpool housewife in both the original West End and Broadway productions of Shirley Valentine, with Simon Callow directing. She first performed the one-woman show at the Vaudeville theatre, London, in 1988, holding audiences in thrall for two hours with a warm, funny monologue about Shirley escaping from her humdrum life cooking egg and chips for her unappreciative husband and “talking to the wall” by travelling to Greece and finding romance with a taverna owner.View image in fullscreenCollins playing parlourmaid Sarah Moffat in ITV’s Upstairs Downstairs. Her husband, John Alderton, joined the cast in 1972 for the second series.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockAlthough the Guardian’s critic felt that the first two acts were essentially “dial-a-joke humour”, the review praised Collins’s comic timing before, in the final act, giving “the sense of a real woman, all stretch-mark and lobster-pink tan, acknowledging she is full of unused life”. In 1989 the production ran for 10 months at the Booth theatre, New York, and Collins won a Tony award for her performance to add to her Olivier award of the previous year.When the story was fleshed out into a movie, withBernard Hillas Shirley’s husband and Tom Conti as her lover, Collins found film fame, although only after Russell loyally held out for her to star while the Hollywood studio Paramount wanted an established American screen actor. She won a Bafta best actress award and was nominated for an Oscar.Her career had until then been confined to stage and television. She was at the heart of the story when Upstairs Downstairs began in 1971, with her character, Sarah Moffat, landing a job as parlourmaid in the Bellamy household at 165 Eaton Place, in the fashionable Belgravia district of London. The understairs staff soon become used to her fanciful tales, including that of being descended from French nobility, although her ambitions to act on stage are briefly fulfilled.When she has an affair with James Bellamy (Simon Williams), the son of the household, Sarah becomes pregnant, but her baby boy dies minutes after birth. Her life changes with the arrival, in the second series (1972-73), of the chauffeur Thomas Watkins, played by Collins’s husband, John Alderton. They were soon a couple on screen and left at the end of the series.Their characters were later spun off into the drama Thomas & Sarah (1979). Filming started on a second series but was abandoned because of an ITV technicians’ strike.Alderton and Collins had by then featured together in other programmes, as a husband and wife – the struggling actor and the daughter of an absent-minded peer – in the sitcom No, Honestly (1974-75), and in various roles for the first two series of Wodehouse Playhouse (1975-76). Later, they starred in Forever Green (1989-92) as a townie couple moving to the countryside, with conservationist issues and stories of badger-saving and alternative medicine.View image in fullscreenCollins with her offscreen husband, John Alderton, playing husband and wife Charles and Clara in the 1974 sitcom No, Honestly.Photograph: ITV/ShutterstockCollins was born in Exmouth, Devon, the eldest of three daughters of Mary (nee Callanan), known as Nora, and William Collins, both teachers. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic faith in Wallasey, Cheshire, then London, where she was educated at the Convent of Sacred Heart, Hammersmith. After training at Central School of Speech and Drama, she worked as a teacher until making her professional acting debut as Sabiha in A Gazelle in Park Lane at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, in 1962.The following year, Collins was an actor and assistant stage manager with the New Irish Players in Killarney. It was her first trip to Ireland, the birthplace of her maternal grandparents, where she fell in love with Tony Rohr, a member of the repertory company. On returning home she discovered she was pregnant, but decided against marriage.Her daughter, whom she named Louise, was born secretly in a London mother-and-baby home run by nuns in 1964, when Collins’s family believed her to be acting on tour. Her decision to give her child away for adoption haunted Collins until, 22 years later, Louise contacted her and they established a relationship.Collins wrote movingly about the pregnancy, birth and decision to have her daughter adopted, in her 1992 book, Letter to Louise. In the final chapters, she addressed her daughter directly with her thoughts from the time: “I was beaten, inadequate, spiritless, hopeless. I had nothing to give you. I would give you away … I promise you that not a day will go by of my life that I do not speak your name and send a little bolt of love to you.”Moving on with her career, Collins made her London stage debut as Lady Janet Wigton in Passion Flower Hotel (Prince of Wales theatre, 1965-66). It began a string of West End roles, from Cecily Cardew in The Importance of Being Earnest (Haymarket theatre, 1968) and Brenda Cooper in The Night I Chased the Women With an Eel (Comedy theatre, 1969) to Nancy Gray in The Happy Apple (Apollo theatre, 1970) and Phoebe Craddock in Romantic Comedy (Apollo, 1983).On television, she played the headstrong Samantha Briggs, whose brother goes missing, in the 1967 Doctor Who story The Faceless Ones, then turned down an offer to become one of the Time Lord’s companions. Following the sci-fi programme’s revival, she returned to it in 2006 as Queen Victoria in the Tooth and Claw adventure.View image in fullscreenCollins playing missionary Margaret Drummond in the second world war film Paradise Road (1997), alongside Glenn Close.Photograph: 20 Century Fox/AllstarCollins’s other TV parts included Dawn, the posher half of the two Liverpool flatmates – alongside Polly James as Beryl – in the first series (1969) of the sitcom The Liver Birds; Harriet Smith, Britain’s envoy to Ireland, in The Ambassador (1998-99); and Sue, mother of Sally Lindsay’s Lisa, in the first two runs of the comedy-drama Mount Pleasant (2011-12), withBobby Ballas her husband.Her first film role was a leading one as a dancer in the 1966 exploitation movie Secrets of a Windmill Girl. After Shirley Valentine kickstarted Collins’s big-screen career, she had powerful roles as Joan Bethel, a feisty Irish nun running a clinic in poverty-stricken Calcutta, in City of Joy (1992); Elsa Tabori, in a haunting performance as a Hungarian Jew escaping the Nazis, in the Holocaust drama My Mother’s Courage (1995); and a missionary among a group of female prisoners of war, keeping sane by forming a choir in Paradise Road (1997).Later, she played a former opera singer in a home for retired musicians in Quartet (2012). However, starring with Joan Collins in the 2017 road movie The Time of Their Lives was more of a triumph of feelgood than drama or comedy. Collins was made OBE in 2001.She first met Alderton when he played Dr Richard Moone in Emergency Ward 10, and she was cast in a 1963 episode as Nurse Elliott. They married in 1970 following his divorce from Jill Browne, his co-star in the TV hospital soap. He, their three children, Nicholas, Kate and Richard, and Louise survive her.Pauline Angela Collins, actor, born 3 September 1940; death announced 6 November 2025Explore more on these topicsFilmActingobituariesShareReuse this content"

But for many, the spotlight also turned to a name that had already long resonated on the global stage – his mother Mira Nair.A pioneering film-maker with a career spanning more than three decades, Nair has continually reshaped how south Asian identity is portrayed on screen. Now, with her son taking a major public office, the cultural legacy she built appears to echo in the next generation.Born in India and educated in Delhi and at Harvard, Nair has always straddled worlds. That cultural, geographic and emotional mix sits at the heart of her storytelling.View image in fullscreenPolitical vision … Shafiq Sayed and Chanda Sharma in Salaam Bombay!Photograph: Channel Four FilmsHer debut feature, Salaam Bombay! (1988),described by the Guardianas “fiercely unsentimental and throbbing with energy”, was a visceral portrait of life on the streets for India’s abandoned children, earning her instant recognition as a film-maker. It marked the start of a body of work that explores identity, migration and belonging with an unusual subtlety – issues that also lie at the heart of her son Mamdani’s political vision.The filmearned an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film – making it only the second Indian film to ever be up for an Academy Award – and won the Caméra d’Or (for debut directors) at Cannes, and became only the second Indian film ever nominated for an Oscar. Nair used the film’s proceeds to establish theSalaam Baalak Trust, a nonprofit that still provides support for street children in Delhi and Mumbai.Her 1991 follow-up,Mississippi Masala,starring a young Denzel Washington and Sarita Choudhury, was one of the earliest films to explore the racial complexities faced by Indian immigrants in America’s deep south. Centered on an interracial love story, it tackled themes of identity, displacement and belonging with rare sensitivity. The film cemented Nair’s reputation as a chronicler of cross-cultural lives and premiered at Venice, where it won the prize for best screenplay.That same fearless spirit drove her more provocative and globally diverse choices in the years that followed. In Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996), Nair explored female sensuality and agency in 16th-century India – a theme rarely addressed in Indian cinema.View image in fullscreenJoyous … Monsoon Wedding.Photograph: USA Films/AllstarBut it wasMonsoon Wedding(2001) that cemented her mainstream success. The vibrant family dramedy, set during a chaotic Delhi wedding, captured the tension between tradition and modernity with a joyous, unsentimental tone. It won the top prize – the Golden Lion – at Venice and became a global hit, especially in the UK, where its story of diaspora identity, arranged marriage, and familial dysfunction struck a chord with British south Asians.She followed it five years later with an adaptation of Jhumpa Lahiri’sThe Namesake, a meditative film that followed an Indian-American family across decades. Quiet, contemplative and beautifully shot, the film stands as one of the most emotional explorations of cultural duality ever put on screen. Like her earlier work it focused on how it feels to live in two worlds and belong fully to neither.Nair’s 2012 adaptation of Mohsin Hamid’sThe Reluctant Fundamentalist– with Riz Ahmed as a Pakistani man imperilled in the US after 9/11 – was bold and provocative, while 2016’sQueen of Katwewas a nuanced but crowd-pleasing biopic of Phiona Mutesi, a chess prodigy from the slums of Kampala, Uganda.Nair’s work has long disrupted the stereotypes imposed on south Asians in cinema. Her characters are complex, her narratives expansive, defined by contradiction, intimacy and emotional truth. Though unapologetically political, her films avoid didacticism, letting her themes unfold through the language of family and memory.That same vision may have shaped her son’s political outlook. Mamdani, a former housing rights activist and state assemblyman, has spoken about the influence of his parents, particularly his mother’s emphasis on cultural rootedness and justice.Nair’s influence is not only cinematic but also civic and a form of cultural activism that brought dignity and humanity to marginalised lives. From street children and undocumented migrants to queer lovers and second-generation immigrants, her protagonists are never peripheral. They are the story.And even as she moved into new forms, directing opera, teaching, founding a film school in Kampala, Nair’s commitment to storytelling as empowerment has remained unwavering. Her most recent work, the seriesA Suitable Boy (2020), adapted from the Vikram Seth novel, was the first BBC series to feature an all-Indian cast.Now, as the city of New York welcomes a mayor who represents a new kind of American leadership, young, brown, Muslim it’s hard not to see the through-line. Long before her son ever canvassed a street in Queens, Nair was laying the groundwork for a more inclusive cultural landscape one film at a time. Mamdani paid tribute to that legacy: “To my parents, mama and baba: You have made me into the man I am today. I am so proud to be your son.”Explore more on these topicsMira NairZohran MamdanifeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a reconcieved version of director Timothy Sheader’s production originally created in 2016 for Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, where it hadtwo further runs; it transferred to the Barbican, as well as touring the UK and the US.Producer Michael Harrison said it was “thrilling” to have a new version created especially for the Palladium, adding: “In Sam we have a true superstar to play the iconic title role.” Describing Jesus Christ Superstar as “one of the biggest institutions in musical theatre the world’s ever known”, Ryder said he was honoured to follow in the footsteps of “rock vocal titans like Ian Gillan and John Farnham”.View image in fullscreenResurrection on the way … Declan Bennett as Jesus, far right, in Jesus Christ Superstar at the Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in London in 2016.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe Palladium is owned by composerAndrew Lloyd Webberwho created Jesus Christ Superstar with lyricist Tim Rice as a 1970 concept album featuring Gillan as Christ in his final days. It triumphed on Broadway the following year and opened in London in 1972, with Paul Nicholas as Jesus. When it closed in 1980 it had become the longest-running musical in the West End at that time. The title role has since been played by Ted Neeley (in the 1973 film version), Farnham (in a 1992 Australian production) and Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach in a 2002 US revival.The Palladium version is again designed by Tom Scutt and choreographed byDrew McOnie, who took over from Sheader as artistic director at the Open Air theatre where he is mounting a new version of Lloyd Webber’sCatsnext summer. Jesus Christ Superstar will run from 20 June to 5 September at the Palladium, which recently had a smash hit with a version of Evita thatalso started life in Regent’s Park.

But the government’s proposedshake-up of the national curriculum, which includes scrapping the English baccalaureate (Ebacc), has been met with overwhelming positivity, with one figure saying it could end “the madness of the past decade”.On Wednesday the Department for Education said it wanted to boost the creative subjects taken at GCSE as part of its wider changes to England’s national curriculum.The changes were unveiled in the government’s response to thecurriculum and assessment reviewpublished this week by Prof Becky Francis, which stated: “The arts subjects are an entitlement rather than an optional extra and are disciplines in their own right.”View image in fullscreenJames Graham.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianThe playwright James Graham, who used his MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh TV festival last year to highlightclass inequality in the arts, welcomed the end of “the madness of the past decade” in which culture subjects had been devalued.He said: “It’s important now to look to the future and use this as an opportunity to ask what a modern-day arts curriculum should look and feel like for 21st-century kids, and the challenging times they’re growing up.”The composer Andrew Lloyd Webber said he was pleased the government had acknowledged “what some of us have known for years: that arts and music in schools is a fundamental right for young people as part of a successful education”.But he added: “There is still no flesh on the bones in the government’s latest announcement. Fundamental questions remain around funding, the structure of the curriculum and, in the case of music, plans to address the chronic shortage of teachers in this country.”TheTurner prize winnerAntony Gormley said the “removal of the shadow of Michael Gove and his Ebacc is to be celebrated”, while the sculptor Anish Kapoor argued that the arts brought “a sense of empathy to our younger citizens – something which is deeply needed, especially now”.The number of UK students taking arts subjects has plummeted in recent years, leading to acreativity crisisin state schools. Since 2010, enrolment in arts GCSEs hasfallen by 40%and the number of arts teachers has declined by 23%.Research last year found that a decade ago about half of all A-level students took at least one humanities subject. By 2021-22 that had fallen to 38%, with the proportion taking arts subjects such as music, design and media studiesdropping to 24%. The latest GCSE data showed the situation had goteven worse.Beth Steel, who has regularly campaigned for better working-class representation in the cultural sector, said art, music and drama “are not extracurricular subjects, they are foundational”.View image in fullscreenBeth Steel, pictured in 2022, says the move is ‘such a huge step in the right direction’.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe Nottingham-born playwright said a school trip to the Tate and the National Gallery where she saw Rothko paintings as a 14-year-old was a pivotal moment for her.“That visit had a profound effect on me: it was a stepping stone on my path,” she said. “Our government’s decision to scrap the Ebacc and recognise this [issue] is such a huge step in the right direction and is essential for working-class children who may otherwise have no access.”The curriculum review argues that schools do not have enough time to pursue creative subjects, something several arts leaders said was often raised with them by teachers and others who work in education.Maria Balshaw, the director of the Tate, said the teachers she welcomed often complained about “not having space in the curriculum” for the arts. “We think that the creative subjects are vital to create stronger, more rounded, more resilient individuals and we welcome the review focusing on the idea of the arts and the ‘enrichment’ they offer,” she said.Indhu Rubasingham, the director and co-chief executive of the National Theatre, said that over the past decade she had spoken to drama teachers who had left the profession because their subject had been cut by their schools.View image in fullscreenIndhu Rubasingham says arts and creativity should be ‘at the heart of every school’.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianShe said: “We’ll do everything we can to support this next stage of work and ensure that the arts and creativity are at the heart of every school around the country. Without it, there is no way that someone like me would be where I am today.”As part of the shift in focus, the government is proposingchanges to performance measuresthat would encourage take-up of arts GCSEs including music, dance and drama by scrapping the Ebacc suite of subjects.Abigail Pogson, the new chief executive of the Barbican, called the move a “critical shift in education”. She said: “I view it as a long-awaited recognition that we must educate our young people as whole, capable humans, not just minds to be trained.”Alistair Spalding, the artistic director and co-chief executive of Sadler’s Wells, said he was pleased to see a “commitment to strengthen the curriculum content for dance within PE”. He said he would like to see the recent decline in pupils taking the subject at GCSE and A-level reversed and he called for “investment in training to ensure there is a pipeline of teachers and talent in place”.View image in fullscreenAlex Beard.Photograph: Royal Opera HouseAlex Beard, the chief executive of the Royal Ballet and Opera, said that in “increasingly digital, atomised and polarised times, the arts are needed more than ever” to develop critical thinking, empathy and common understanding. He said extending opportunity and access to the arts through the curriculum would also “help ensure that our art forms reflect the richness and diversity of society”.The saxophonist and composer YolanDa Brown said: “As someone who found my voice through a school saxophone, I know first-hand how life-changing great arts education can be. So I welcome any move that puts music and creativity back at the heart of the curriculum, not as an optional extra but as a right for every child.”Brown emphasised that the proposals must be matched with “proper investment and support for teachers”, including the provision of instruments and rehearsal space. “The real test will be whether a child in Newcastle has the same access as a child in Hammersmith; whether every school, not just the already well-resourced ones, can offer meaningful creative experiences,” she said.Nadia Fall, the artistic director of the Young Vic, said “putting arts back on the table for pupils” was “long overdue and critical”.She said: “It doesn’t mean that every pupil will pursue a career in the arts – though why not? There is a thriving industry out here and we need them. It’s about lighting up all parts of the brain and the person.“Einstein played the violin from the age of six; it wasn’t just a hobby, it helped him work out complex physics problems. Our education system is all too often forced to put things in boxes, however our brains aren’t necessarily designed that way and nor are the emerging industries of the future.”On Wednesday, Ed Sheeran praised the government’s move to overhaul the teaching of music in England’s state schools, having campaigned for change including by signing anopen letter to Keir Starmerin January.Explore more on these topicsArts in schoolsCurriculumsEducation policyArts and humanitiesArtMusicDrama and dancenewsShareReuse this content"

And this is a wholehearted take – rampantly gothic in its green and red-themed sets and costumes, and faithfully Romantic in its exploration of life and death. Oscar Isaac’s Victor Frankenstein is a serious man (with serious sideburns), hubristically obsessed with scientific discovery, while Jacob Elordi brings pathos to the Creature, a marble-skinned innocent learning harsh lessons about humanity. Christoph Waltz as Victor’s backer and Mia Goth as his brother’s inquisitive fiancee add flourishes to a tale often told but rarely with such devotion.Simon WardellPrey (Dan Trachtenberg, 2022), 9pm, Film4Sometimes one good idea can revitalise a tired franchise.

It’s also a candid exploration of gay sexuality in an era when it dared not speak its name. Sassoon is played affectingly by Jack Lowden and Peter Capaldi at different ages, offering an added generational contrast.SWExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV tonightDavid OlusogaThe Walking DeadAlan PartridgeGraham NortonGuillermo del ToroTerence DaviesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The studio didn’t just maintain a robust production line that won over both critics and crowds, they also managed to change our concept of what animation could achieve as an art form. Radically expansive visuals were matched with surprising, weighty ideas, conjuring the kind of magic that had been largely absent from Disney’s output in the years prior.Train Dreams review – Joel Edgerton superb in Malickian story of trees, grief and railroadsRead moreWhile many blamed the ensuing fade on Covid, in truth it had already started before then. Like the rest of the industry, the company had become overly reliant on sequels, with the four years before 2020 seeing one original versus four follow-ups and as cinemas shuttered, their latest offering, Onward, was middling enough to suggest that even superfans should be concerned about the future. It’s been a case of ongoing underwhelm ever since, a low point reached by this year’s Elio, a patchworked mess that had the lowest opening ever for a Pixar film (their only bright spot Inside Out 2 has left their upcoming slate looking predictably sequel-heavy).It’s hard not to see Netflix’s pre-Thanksgiving adventure In Your Dreams as an attempt to fill the gap both visually and thematically, the film sticking closely to the Pixar playbook. It’s not up to their one-time standard, but it’s more engaging than the average streaming cartoon and a damn sight better than what Netflix gave us last year, the remarkably uglySpellbound, which tried and miserably failed to give us a Disney princess copycat.In Your Dreams is more reminiscent of Inside Out with shades of Coco; a quest narrative that takes place in a world close to our own, in this instance the world of dreams. Like Spellbound, it’s also a tale of children trying to deal with parents whose marriage is on the rocks, a never not relevant or welcome conversation to introduce and assist with. Stevie is a girl whose dreams are of better days, when the family dynamic was operating as it should (“like one of those happy families you see at the beginning of a disaster movie” she says) but even her consciousness knows that something is wrong, turning her dreams into nightmares and bringing her back to the less idyllic real world. A rather convoluted set of circumstances leads her and younger brother Elliot to a book about the Sandman who can allegedly turn dreams into reality and with their mother threatening to leave the family home for a new job, the pair are propelled into a journey inside their minds.The aesthetic of In Your Dreams, especially that of the human characters, is so unavoidably Pixar-coded that it would feel shameless were it not the brainchild of Alex Woo, the writer-director who was once a story artist on many of their defining titles, including Ratatouille and Wall-E. This is still very much theNetflixmockbuster version of that but it’s considerably more convincing than many of their junkier lower-tier efforts. Woo and co-writer Erik Benson, another ex-Pixar bod, do a decent enough job of trying to also bring with them the same style of script – life lessons delivered without a heavy hand woven into a dynamic caper – and while their trademark emotional soar never arrives, there are worthy observations here.Like in Inside Out, where we were taught that sadness must exist alongside happiness, here we’re told that nightmares can help strengthen us in the same way that dreams can lead to inspiration. It’s not exactly groundbreaking but it has more texture than a simple “family is important” message and along with the relatively rare decision to give a brother-sister relationship priority, it helps to slightly distinguish this from the pack. What they can’t quite transfer is the wit, the film coming up short when it tries to amuse rather than teach us. An inevitable sidekick, this time a stuffed toy come to life voiced by Craig Robinson, is aggressively unfunny while the various snapshots of dream worlds are lacking in anything truly silly enough to make us smile.Woo, though, is a talent that Netflix would be wise to keep in its animated stable and with a stronger script and less derivative concept (there are also notes of Coraline in here), one could imagine something better in his future. At a runtime that almost pushes it into more of an extended episode than a movie (advertised as 90 but finishing at under 80), this is a little too slight and breezy to really make much of an impression, like a dream you’ll forget as soon as you open your eyes.In Your Dreams is now showing at select cinemas and will be released on Netflix on 14 NovemberExplore more on these topicsAnimation in filmNetflixComedy filmsAction and adventure filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

But South Korean choreographer Sung Im Her’s sparky sequences forParadise Now!at the Bush theatre in 2022 were not just strikingly inventive but also perfectly attuned to playwright Margaret Perry’s satire.Alongside movement direction for theatre, her dance productions have consideredthe sway of social mediaand#MeToo in her home country. She now confronts another headline issue, the climate crisis, in the Southbank Centre’sKunstyperformance series.In a solo prologue, she steals on to a barren stage in silence, gradually unfolding her body. From a compact state she limbers into a canter around the perimeter, starkly lit by an imprisoning grid of bulbs. This individual transformation prefigures a collective one as the choreographer exits, replaced by six dancers initially buckling under the world’s weight. They veer from inertia to thwarted intentions, huddling vulnerably under a spotlight as if cast adrift. While they’re dressed in shirts and slacks, the parallel is those images of polar bears on shrinking icebergs.View image in fullscreenIndividual transformation … Sung Im Her in 1 Degree Celsius‘The body is everything’: Sung Im Her’s insatiable desire for danceRead moreMio Jue’s costumes incorporate scraps of silver, giving this ragtag band the air of survivors amid dystopian wreckage. Gradually they assemble to confront an issue that has overwhelmed them. It’s a compelling call to replace climate anxiety with collaborative action. Husk Husk and Lucy Duncan’s score accordingly moves from woozy and spectral, with glimmers of hope, into a thumping pulse as the intensity builds and the ensemble stride with straight backs, endure body blows and mobilise to a dancer’s occasional cry. Crucially, the performers are shown to not just be keeping up with but learning from each other.As their arms are raised and thrown down in release, there’s a sense not just of shedding fear but holding on to joy and that switch is similarly conveyed through Young Uk Lee’s lighting. We need to roll up our sleeves, the piece suggests, but let down our hair too.There is a gnomic coda and an overall coolness that can feel restrictive. But what it lacks in sweep and emotion it mostly makes up for in the urgency for a collective reset as those bodies, this body of people, prove more resilient than they first seemed.AtCrescent theatre, Birmingham, on 8 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageDanceTheatreSouthbank CentreClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s something that is hard to pull off, melting the fourth wall and fusing those two experiences. Not just giving people permission to dance, unselfconsciously, but to tap into what the performers are expressing – in this case, the hopeful freedom and defiant joy of reggae culture.There are five main dancers but these Sadler’s Wells East shows also have a supporting cast of students and elders. It’s a splendidly diverse setup, making the point that everyone is invited. They get us on our feet (there are seats for people who need them), but also arguably form a kind of curtain between audience and the main performers. Still, they’ve got a good vibe.Bibi Rukiya’s Restless Daughter review – Lorca’s matriarch sparks tragic dance of desireRead moreChoreographerAkeim Toussaint Buckhas not only created the dance, but also written and sung the dub, reggae and jazz-tinged soundtrack for the show with his band, the Magnificence. The bass comes through the speakers, volume pushed up to distortion, like a fuzzy-edged bullet you take to the chest. It’s a slow heartbeat of rhythm, the two and the four, that carries the show. You feel it like a call and response in your own dancing, step on one, catch the beat in your body on two. The dancers expand on this, the reverb bouncing through them. They sync up in laid-back routines, get lost in their own worlds, the moves easy and earthy, souls feeding on sounds.The mood is warmth, community, smiles, a little samey. Then one dancer clutches his hands to his face and chest, pushing out his voice to call for freedom for the world and for Palestine (there have been protests over Sadler’s Wells accepting sponsorship from Barclays, which provides financial services to defence companies supplying Israel, so it’s a live topic here). The other dancers surround him and he is absorbed back into the dance. It’s an interesting bit of grit, but the party soon resumes. Free is an enjoyable gathering, but there’s a stronger piece of theatre in there potentially.AtSadler’s Wells East, London, until 8 November then atBradford Arts Centreon 21 NovemberExplore more on these topicsDanceReggaeSadler's WellsreviewsShareReuse this content"

No other acoustic instrument pierces and shakes the air in quite the same way.Composer-performers such as Kali Malone, Jonny Greenwood, Ellen Arkbro, Sarah Davachi and Kit Downes are just the start. An experimental organ culture has grown in the UK thanks to events likeOrgan Reframedat Union Chapel in London (which over the past decade has commissioned music from composers including Mark Fell, Éliane Radigue and Hildur Guðnadóttir) and the fantastically named Bristol concert series Mainly Slow Organ Music, as well as adventurous organists such as James McVinnie.Infinity Gradient is the latest in a growing canon of initially serene organ music that later reveals depth and grit. An hour-long piece for organ and 100 loudspeakers, it was composed in 2021 by New York-based composer Tristan Perich, and performed with McVinnie at London’s Royal Festival Hall in 2024. After an opening flourish, the piece is arranged in seven sections but, in essence, it works through a handful of stretched crescendos.Perich’s breathing, warping electronics feel like a natural addition to the organ’s already extensive sound palette. His textures move surprisingly quickly through moods; oscillating figures morph from Caterina Barbieri to Baba O’Riley. Drones, pulses and scratchy hums form the base of this musical language, to which the organ adds layer after imposing layer. The moment when the full organ kicks in (with four massive subwoofers to boot) is well worth the wait.Hugh MorrisThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenA master craftswoman … Waterbaby.Photograph: Levi AxenneWaterbaby – Beck n CallSinging of hopeless infatuation, the Swedish Sub Pop signee deploys one of the best piano riffs we’ve heard in ages, a head-nodding shuffle that melts into a string arrangement later on: masterful craft.Underscores – Do ItA key collaborator onthe new Danny Brown album, the hyperpop star threads Timbaland-era Justin Timberlake through a taut, terrific track made for earnest 00s MTV dance moves.Mssingno – Think of MePairing a Brandy sample with a UKG beat isn’t the most original idea, but then again Mssingno is the master of these ghostly nostalgic reworks – and the chorus is pure sad-banger rapture.Mala & Magugu – Militant DonIt’s been rattling around sets by Four Tet, Skream and more for a while, and now this chunk of classic dubstep lands on the general public with thudding force, further enlivened by Magugu’s Flowdan-style chatter.Nothing – Cannibal WorldA heaving, bending mass of shoegaze guitars and wafty dream-pop singing is churned up by junglist breakbeat: an absolutely inspired concept from the Philly band.JBee – If I Lose (ft Kidwild)Over pink-sunset drill production from DCBeats, JBee glumly reflects on the relentlessness of the grind, while Kidwild – capping a superb year – lets himself be vulnerable: “I just want you to hold me.”B​eau Mahadev – SuckerLeading off the NYC electronic producer’s atmospheric debut album, Subterra, a tech-house melody ripples like a tropical fish through a cavern; fans of Erika de Casier will love the vocals, too.Ben Beaumont-ThomasSubscribe to the Guardian’s rolling Add to Playlist selections on Spotify – or use the playlist URL to transfer it toApple,Tidalor other services.Explore more on these topicsMusicAdd to playlistExperimental musicClassical musicfeaturesShareReuse this content"

From Caravaggio’s intense scenes to Rembrandt’s profound portraits, artists had been experimenting with darkness for centuries. This painting shows how deeply Dutch 17th-century artists were drawn to the dark. It dwells in the darkest part of the church, brooding among shadows. At the sides, we can see the church’s public spaces are brightly lit, presumably with many candles. But in the dark, less visited part, fears and phantoms might dwell. In a greathorror story by Sheridan Le Fanu, the similarly dark paintings of Gottfried Schalken turn out to contain a terrifying secret. Perhaps this painting holds a horror story of its own, for a tomb in it bears the name of Hendrick van Steenwyck the Younger – but the canvas is signed by him too. Did he paint it posthumously? A more boring explanation is that it’s by an imitator.National Gallery, LondonSign up to the Art Weekly newsletterIf you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email,please sign up here.Get intouchIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please emailnewsletters@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsArt and designArt Weekly newsletterPaintingPhotographyArtExhibitionsDiane ArbusDavid HockneyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Whether I’ve been on the hunt for vintage cashmere, denim, fabulous 1950s dresses, garb for a fancy dress party or even a kilt, this store has sorted me out. It is always a favourite for when friends visit the city, and whether you are looking to buy or not, it is worth a visit just to see its eclectic collection.AmyChic, thrifty shopping in BudapestView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pascal Boegli/AlamyAn Erasmus exchange took me to Budapest, where I discovered a city full of vintage shops and flea markets. The city is dotted with Humana shops for staple wardrobe finds; there’s theEcseri flea marketfor the more unusual (interspersed with the occasional plastic Stalin bust); plus chic, rambling stores likeSzputnyikandRetrock Vintage– think racks of leather jackets and tulle tops among giant monstera plants. Antiques shops are also found tucked away, their contents spilling on to the pavements outside. A particularly favourite find was a set of intricate hand-painted embroidery layouts on kraft paper from the 1930s, each signed by the artist.KatieLyon’s canalside treasure troveView image in fullscreenTheLes Puces du Canalflea market, in the Villeurbanne suburb on the Canal de Jonage, is a treasure trove for reasonably priced vintage clothes, 1960s paraphernalia and vintage furniture (much of the latter still falling in the sub-€150 category).

Prices are very reasonable and you can easily spend most of a day there. There’s even a hot yoga studio, climbing wall and pole-dancing classes in the same building if you want to throw some extra physical activity into your visit. Nearby Stockport town centre has lots of great indie restaurants, museums and shops to make a day of it.LaurenBeing thrifty in OsloView image in fullscreenIn Oslo,Uffis a lovely chain of secondhand clothing stores.

Simple, functional and so well made.Gabrielle WynRummaging around in PragueView image in fullscreenI really enjoyed Prague for its cheap, vintage secondhand shopping. I found an abundance of 1980s and 90s clothes, with lots of pop-up style shops to rummage around. I was there in June, and bought a fun shirt, and a pair of gorgeous hand-painted, Czech plates atRestart Shop.Bellitex Fashion, just south of Prague’s Old Town, also had a large, well-organised selection, and I was pleasantly surprised to find some other cool, vintage clothing shops in the same street. Perfect area to explore for an afternoon … and all at low prices.TomTrondheim is a vintage dreamView image in fullscreenArven Vintagein the heart of Trondheim is a dream for anyone who loves clothes with a bit of history. The rails are packed with denim classics such as Levi’s, Lee and Wrangler, plus soft wool jumpers, blouses and beautifully made jackets. Everything’s from the 1990s or earlier, and the focus on natural fabrics like wool, linen and silk makes it feel special. I picked up a gorgeous Italian wool blazer there, and people always ask where it’s from. Arven has that rare mix of quality, character and charm that makes vintage shopping such a joy. The staff are lovely too – knowledgable and clearly passionate about what they do.

Often made with ground nuts instead of flour, this gives them a fudgy, moist texture. Here, ripe pears sink gently into a dark chocolate and hazelnut batter, with the flavours of vanilla, almond and cardamom subtly enhancing the depth of the chocolate and teasing out the fruit’s perfume.Pear, chocolate and hazelnut tortePrep10 minCook1 hr 15 min,plus coolingServes8-10150g blanched hazelnuts200g dark chocolate(about 70% cocoa), roughly chopped150g unsalted butter, cubed150g soft brown sugar1 tsp vanilla extract½ tsp almond extract4 large eggs, separated¼ tsp fine sea salt¾ tsp ground cardamom(from the seeds of 12-18 pods)2 small ripe pears(conference, williams), peeled, quartered and coredTo finishIcing sugar, for dustingCreme fraiche or ice-cream, to serveHeat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and line the base and sides of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking paper.Put the hazelnuts on a small baking tray and toast in the oven for five to eight minutes, until light golden and fragrant. Leave them to cool, then blitz in a food processor until finely ground, but with a few nubbly bits for texture.Put the chocolate and butter in a medium heatproof bowl set over but not touching a pan of barely simmering water. Stir gently until melted and smooth, then take off the heat. Add the brown sugar, vanilla and almond extracts, and whisk gently to combine. Leave to cool for about five minutes, then add the egg yolks and whisk gently to incorporate. Fold in the ground hazelnuts, salt and cardamom.Put the eggs whites in the clean bowl of an electric mixer and beat with the whisk attachment on medium-high until soft peaks form. Stir a spoonful into the chocolate batter to loosen it, then gently fold in the rest in two batches. Keep a light hand while doing this, to retain as much air in the mix as possible.Scrape the batter into the prepared cake tin. Slice each quartered piece of pear thinly but not all the way through the top, so they hold together, then arrange the pears, slightly overlapping, on top of the batter. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until set around the edges and the centre is still slightly wobbly. The pears will sink a little as the torte bakes.Leave to cool in the tin, then release and transfer to a serving plate. Dust lightly with icing sugar and serve at room temperature with creme fraiche or ice-cream.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotCakeDessertFruitChocolateWinter food and drinkBakingrecipesShareReuse this content"

It’s a fantastic and easy weeknight supper, packed with spicy and fragrant flavours.To further elevate the dish, I used a range of Tesco Finest ingredients. The orzo has a traditional rough texture, which is great for capturing all the spices and flavours. The salmon is grilled and served with a fresh mint raita made using Greek yoghurt, which is thick and creamy – perfect for cutting through the spice. Serving it with a dollop of Tesco Finest spiced mango chutney adds sweetness and is a lovely way to finish the dish off.Prep20 minCook25 minServes22 Tesco Finest Scottish salmon fillets3 tbsp tikka masala curry paste2 tbsp Tesco Finest Greek yoghurt2 corn on the cobs50g Tesco Finest West Country butter1 onion,finely chopped1 large garlic clove,finely grated1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin seeds1⁄2tsp chilli flakes200g Tesco Finest orzo1⁄2small lemon,juicedHandful coriander,finely choppedHandful mint,finely chopped40g pomegranate seeds1⁄2small red onion,finely choppedFor the raita100g Tesco Finest Greek yoghurt1⁄4cucumber,coarsely grated1⁄4small bunch mint,very finely chopped1⁄2tsp fine sea saltTo serveTesco Finest spiced mango chutneySuggested wine pairingTesco Finest Steep Slopes Mosel Riesling 75clShopper buttonView image in fullscreenPut the salmon fillets in a bowl.
