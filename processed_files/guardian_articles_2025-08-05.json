But why?Lucy KnightTue 5 Aug 2025 12.23 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShareHannah Clark got her first spray tan for her school prom and has never looked back. “I’m not proud of it, but I have used sunbeds,” says the 29-year-old graphic designer from Plymouth. Her goal is “that glow you get when coming back from holiday. You know, when you walk around and people say: ‘Oh, you look really healthy.’ It’s that feeling I’m chasing.”Clark is far from alone. On TikTok and Instagram, posts with the hashtag “sunbed” number more than 500,000. Last year,a survey from skin cancer charity Melanoma Focusfound that 28% of UK adults use sunbeds, but this rose to 43% among those aged 18 to 25. This new generation of younger tanning obsessives will go to extreme lengths to darken their skin. Some track the UV index – the level of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation – and deliberately sit in the sun at the most dangerous times of day. Others use unregulated nasal tanning sprays and injections, which rely on a chemical to darken the skin.All the people under 30 I spoke to for this article know how dangerous tanning is. NHS guidance states that there isno safe or healthy way to get a tanand advises keeping out of the sun between 11am and 3pm, wearing sunscreen of at least factor 30, and covering up with clothing, hats and sunglasses. Dr Zoe Venables, a consultant dermatologist at Norfolk and Norwich University hospitals, with an interest in skin cancer epidemiology, says that when skin turns darker after UV exposure it “suggests you’re damaging those cells in your skin”.Sunbeds are categorised by theWorld Health Organization(WHO) as “dangerous” – with their cosmetic use increasing incidences of skin cancers and driving down the age at which skin cancer first appears. It says people who have used a sunbed at least once at any point in their lives have a 20% greater chance of developing melanoma –the deadliest of the three most common forms of skin cancer– than someone who hasn’t. For someone who has used a tanning bed for the first time before the age of 35, there is a 59% greater chance of developing melanoma.Despite this stark reality, having a tan is still presented to many young people as aspirational – whether it’sfaux tan-lines appearing on catwalksor bronzed influencers on holidays in Dubai. Many sunbed shop owners sell tanning as a form of “self-care”, while influencers post “come for a sunbed with me” videos. Perhaps most perniciously, some sunbed shops even make light of the known risk associated with them. One meme shared on Instagram by a tanning salon overlays the text: “When someone tells you sunbeds are bad for you” with a clip from the sitcom Benidorm, in which the character Madge Harvey says: “I spy with my little eye something beginning with AB: absolute bollocks.”View image in fullscreenNasal tanning sprays can ‘cause nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure.’Illustration: Jacky Sheridan/The GuardianEmily Harris, 23, from Leeds, uses sunbeds. Her parents both work for the NHS and have warned her about the risks. But she says that having spent most of her teenage years in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, followed by various global conflicts and the ever-looming presence of climate breakdown, the dangers of a sunbed seem small by comparison. “You can die of anything – do you know what I mean?” she says.While Harris, who works in sales, can’t afford to use sunbeds all the time, she uses them whenever she has “a bit of spare money”, making use of the deals that salons offer. Before a recent holiday, she bought a package that gave her unlimited minutes, with a daily limit, for four weeks. “I was going every day,” Harris says, which she admits “is a bit silly”, but adds: “I was trying to make the most of the package.”As well as using tanning beds, Harris is “obsessed with tracking the UV”, and has the index on the lock-screen of her phone. She and her colleagues plan their breaks around times when the UV index is highest, so they can maximise their exposure to the dangerous radiation. A number of her friends also use nasal tanning sprays, which were the subject of aTrading Standards warningissued earlier this year that stated: “These products can cause nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, and even changes in mole shape and size … studies have shown a potential link to melanoma, a type of skin cancer.” Harris tried one when her friend had a spare bottle, but “didn’t see a result” so hasn’t used one again. Was she worried about what might have been in it? “To be honest, not really. I know it’s bad, but at the time, I was more bothered about getting a tan.”Nasals, as they are known, usually contain a lab-made substance called melanotan II, a chemical that darkens skin pigmentation. Though it is illegal to sell medicinal products containing melanotan II in the UK, cosmetic productsfall outside that remitand are easily available on social media. Dr Suraj Kukadia, a GP known to his 282,000 TikTok followers as “Doctor Sooj”, is concerned about the popularity of nasal sprays. He says melanotan II can also lead to “painful and sustained erections in men, kidney damage, acne and muscle-wasting”.View image in fullscreenFaux tan-lines on the catwalk.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesHolly Feldman, 25, lives in Surrey and is the CEO of a swimwear boutique. She has more than 10,000 followers on Instagram and is often sent free tanning products such as nasal sprays and injections. “I think that was why it was so addictive for me,” she says. Though she had no idea what was in these products, and the injections in particular made her feel unwell, she says: “I was just trying to turn a blind eye to it because I was so obsessed with how it made me look.”Feldman recently appeared on former Love Island contestant Olivia Attwood’s ITV documentary seriesThe Price of Perfection, in which Attwood explores the risks of various cosmetic treatments. Being on the show made Feldman realise how much potential damage she could be doing. She hasn’t used a tanning injection for four months, and has reduced her use of a nasal spray to a couple of times over the past month, when previously it would have been four inhalations a day. “I do still use sunbeds,” she says. “But I have cut down. There was a time when I was going on them four, five, six times a week and now I only go on them once or twice.”Data from the UK and Ireland’s Sunbed Association suggests that tanning beds are most popular among 25- to 45-year-olds, and more women than men use them. But that’s not to say gen Z men are free from the pressure to sport a tan.Craig Hopkins, a 29-year-old dance teacher based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, says he uses sunbeds to “look like I’ve just come back from holiday”. He prefers the look of a “real” tan to a fake tan, which ties in to existing social media trends such as “looking expensive” and “quiet luxury”.“On Instagram especially, everyone is always on holiday, always super brown. So it’s probably just trying to keep up,” Harris says. Like Harris, Hopkins also tried a nasal spray once, via a friend who used to sell them, but it made him “feel really sick”.Despite the known risks and side-effects, most of the young people I spoke to for this article were still willing to give nasal sprays a try. Megan Urbaniak, a 23-year-old nail technician from Rotherham, says: “I feel as if I know a million people who use them and everyone seems to have been fine. It does kind of weird me out that they don’t tell you what’s in them, but I’m sure there’s worse in the world.”Urbaniak is a regular sunbed user – and has even encouraged friends to use them before going on holiday “because it stops you from burning immediately when going in the sun”. Venables is quick to debunk claims such as this, saying that all it does is put your skin through even more “excess UV exposure”. She points to another type of common skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, which is thought to be due to cumulative UV exposure.View image in fullscreen‘I was just turning a blind eye to the risks.’Photograph: Dangubic/Getty Images (posed by model)While Urbaniak does not seem to be put off by any safety concerns, she is keen to stress that there is a “cultural line that you probably shouldn’t cross” when it comes to tanning as a white person. “I don’t think that my body is capable of going that colour, but if it was, I’d like to think someone would tell me to stop.”That said, it isn’t just white people who like to tan. Melissa Jones, 19, from Chester, says she has “seen way more people of colour – including south-east Asian girls like me – getting into tanning. For me, it’s not about being darker – it’s about adding that warm, radiant glow and evening out my tone”.Like Feldman, Jones uses the word “addictive” in relation to her tanning habit, and thinks it helps her in her job as a content creator. Tanned skin “looks amazing on camera and in content”, she says. However, she has recently switched from using tanning beds to using only fake tan. “I became more aware of the risks, like ageing, skin cancer, all of that.”View image in fullscreenJak Howell, who was diagnosed with stage three advanced melanoma when he was 21.Photograph: undefined/Courtesy of Jak HowellThe WHO has urged countries to consider banning sunbeds:Australia banned all commercial sunbeds 10 years agoandBrazil banned them in 2009. Kukadia and Venables both say they would like them banned in the UK.Jak Howell, a 26-year-old content creator from Swansea, has been urging his followers to stop using sunbeds since he was diagnosed with stage three advanced melanoma when he was 21, which his doctors were surprised to see in someone so young, and said was probably due to his use of sunbeds. Howell had been using sunbeds regularly since he was 15 (it has been illegal for under-18s to use tanning beds since 2010, but the ones Howell used weren’t staffed. Customers bought tokens from a machine and slotted them into the beds). When a mole appeared on his back that “kept bleeding and scabbing over but never healing”, he sent a photograph of it to his GP and was immediately referred to hospital.He underwent radiotherapy and surgeries to remove his lymph nodes, but these failed to remove the cancer. Eventually, after a year of immunotherapy, which “completely knocks you for six”, he went into remission. Howell now wants to see sunbeds banned. He tells young users: “OK, it hasn’t happened yet, but it could happen. And when it does happen, it is far, far worse than anything I could ever describe and you could ever imagine.”For many young people, though, the allure of the sunbed’s “instant fix” is too great to resist. And it’s not as if this is the first time young people have put themselves at risk. As Kukadia points out: “If alcohol was discovered or invented now, it would be illegal.” But tanning does feel different from other classic rebellious pursuits such as binge drinking, cigarettes and drugs because people don’t do it for fun, but to achieve a certain aesthetic – a symptom, perhaps, of our screen-filtered lives.The best fake tan, tried and tested, for a sunkissed, streak-free glowRead more“If I wasn’t on social media, I probably wouldn’t use sunbeds,” Feldman admits, but because her job requires social media use, she can’t see herself stopping.A few years ago, Clark noticed a dark, “pretty scary-looking” lesion on her leg, and was referred to a dermatologist. Though it didn’t turn out to be skin cancer-related, she had to have it removed, and the experience has stopped her being so “frivolous” with tanning beds.Urbaniak can’t see herself giving up either. “If something were to go wrong, then maybe I’d reconsider,” she says. “But I feel as if I’m in that generation where we all just live in denial until something happens.”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And yet, as she told the magazine, she did not have the money to cover even a six-month break from the industry. Unlike some of her Euphoria peers, Sweeney is not a nepo baby; she was raised middle-class in northern Idaho and Spokane, Washington, and began working as a child actor at 13. She acted continuously throughout her teens – on Criminal Minds and Grey’s Anatomy, then small roles on prestige projects like Sharp Objects, The Handmaid’s Tale and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood – because there was no fallback cushion. “I don’t have someone supporting me, I don’t have anyone I can turn to, to pay my bills or call for help,” she said.Jeans, controversy, used bathwater: Sydney Sweeney’s selling it all. A showbiz masterclass, if you ask me | Marina HydeRead moreEven after working on a hit HBO show, which did allow her to buy a house in LA, money was tight. “They don’t pay actors like they used to, and with streamers, you no longer get residuals,” Sweeney explained. “The established stars still get paid, but I have to give 5% to my lawyer, 10% to my agents, 3% or something like that to my business manager. I have to pay my publicist every month, and that’s more than my mortgage.” Sweeney spoke with the authority and detail of someone who actually had to review her budget every month – for the stylist, the publicist, the makeup, the travel, the unspoken demands of being a fame-aiming young actor in the Instagram age, and particularly a young beautiful woman. Hence, her many brand deals – Miu Miu, Armani, Laneige. “If I just acted, I wouldn’t be able to afford my life in LA,” she said. “I take deals because I have to.”I still think about this interview whenever Sweeney’s name comes up, which is too often lately. For one, it’s still the most transparent I’ve ever heard an actor of her cohort be about money – no one is talking about paying their publicist or their mortgage – and two, it helps explain her increasinglyomnipresent and fractious brand dealsthat have arguably eclipsed her acting work. Sweeney doesn’t just rep high-end fashion labels like Miu Miu, typical for actors attempting to enter the rarefied field of movie stardom; she’s now also selling soap allegedly containing a “touch” of her bathwater for Dr Squatch, ice-cream for Baskin-Robbins, and fuzzy pink loafers for who knows who. You may have heard that she’s recently found herself in theculture-war crosshairsover someads for American Eagle. As the camera pans over a horizontal Sweeney zipping up her tight blue jeans, she says in typical monotone: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” Another spot finds her admonishing a wandering camera away from her two most talked-about assets – “eyes up here”.The ad, predictably, caused a stir on an internet whereeverything is now ragebait– the posting left said its invocation of Americana and “great genes” dogwhistled white supremacy, the Maga right celebrated it as a nail in the coffin of “wokeness”. (For what it’s worth, American Eagle has said that the campaign “is and always was about the jeans”.) Trump posted about it on Truth Social. And all of that was before it was revealed that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida in June 2024.American Eagle faces backlash over ‘Sydney Sweeney has great jeans’ adRead moreAll of this, it must be noted, has happened without Sweeney publicly saying a thing. (One can assume, based on her comments about money and an old social media brouhaha about Maga family members, that she supportedDonald Trumpin 2024, and that she moved to Florida for tax reasons. But until Sweeney confirms anything, these remain assumptions.) How does a relatively successful Hollywood actor with at least one box office hit under her belt – that would be the middling but popular 2024 romcom Anyone But You – end up this polarizing?Two separate but inextricable things: an incendiary combination of social media’s death spiral into hollow, fleeting culture wars, and a career spent walking the perilously thin line between poking fun at male egos and inflating them. The former is more easily identified – the internet culture SubstackGarbage Daytraced the American Eagle controversy to a familiar pattern of activity on X, a site that is a fraction of the size it used to be and is now about 75% bots; the remaining holdouts are “conservative aggregators, business world influencers, celebrity stan accounts, and libs who won’t leave the site and still post like it’s 2018”. The ad, an artless mix of lowest-common denominator triggers, worked on all four groups. The cycle frothed enough on X over a weekend to get picked up by Fox News, then the most smug Maga politicians looking for a dunk, and then, inevitably, the president who must always get in on the attention. In the posting economy, all that matters is that the controversy feels real, and everyone is talking about it.Whatever the actual size of the outrage – I, for one, sense more fatigue than actual anger – the chatter does represent a natural endpoint to Sweeney’s longstanding tactic of being the first to acknowledge, and now bank on, male attention on her breasts, and to be ruthlessly pragmatic about business. Both are dubious tactics with, I’d argue, diminishing returns. I have been a fan of Sweeney’s since she broke out as a terrifyingly droll gen Z menace on the first season of The White Lotus in 2021, and I date the shift to 2022, around the time of that landmark THR interview. When IinterviewedSweeney in 2021, the then-23-year-old was as open about her business ambitions – getting a bachelor’s degree to prevent getting “fucked over” by contract negotiations, producing her own projects – as she was wary about the internet’s outrage machine. She was promoting her erotic thriller The Voyeurs, in which she appeared nude, and dealing with the aftermath of nude screenshots from Euphoria making the rounds online. Her strategy for handling it all, she told me, was dissociation: “I never actually put Syd out there,” she said. “No one really knows Syd.”View image in fullscreenGlen Powell and Sydney Sweeney in Anyone But You.Photograph: Brook Rushton/APIn the years since, Sweeney seems to have adopted a more offensive approach to the attention – and her elevation by the male right as, toquotethe New Yorker’s Lauren Michele Jackson, “rejoicing in a perceived return to a bygone beauty standard in the wake of all that overzealous feminism they blame on the left” – by turning it into money and a punchline. She poked fun at boob fixation with aHooters skit on SNL; she wore a sweatshirt blaring “SORRY FOR HAVING GREAT TITS AND CORRECT OPINIONS”; she routinely addresses the boobs in the room with a broad-like confidence. “The biggest misconception about me is that I’m a dumb blonde with big tits,” she said in aninterviewlast year. “I’m naturally a brunette.” Cue laughs. At the same time, she’s exemplified the pop feminist mantra of getting one’s bag – starring in the dreadful Madame Web was a“business decision”to network with Sony execs and get her planned Barbarella remake greenlit and Anyone But You sold, which she successfully marketed on her own TikTok. Taking every brand deal while producing would-be auteur horror with Immaculate.All of this has, unfortunately, overshadowed a promising dramatic acting career, as demonstrated by a remarkable turn inReality, as a real-life whistleblower brimming with anxiety and righteousness; inThe Voyeurs, a throwback erotic thriller that would have made more of a splash had it not been dropped on Amazon; on Euphoria, where she imbued the beleaguered Cassie with a real sense of teenage volatility. Amid the political controversy, Sweeney remains, as ever, booked and busy.She’s making an awards play with Christy, as the 90s boxer Christy Martin, aiming critical buzz with The Housemaid, Paul Feig’s film alongside Amanda Seyfried. She’s locked down two huge video game remakes withMichael BayandJon M Chu, secured the role of 50s bombshell Kim Novak in Colman Domingo’s directorial debutScandalous!, just appeared alongside Julianne Moore in yet another forgettable Apple TV+ film. On the acting side, she’s still the young woman from three years ago, clear-eyed about the industry, trying everything, lining up the work. For all our sakes, let’s hope the conversation gets back there, too.Explore more on these topicsSydney SweeneyUS televisionTelevisionThe White LotusAdvertisingDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s nuanced, subtly political, poignant TV – and there’s never been a better time for its focus on tolerancePhil HarrisonTue 5 Aug 2025 10.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 10.25 EDTShareIt’s been 15 years since we last enjoyed the company of Hank and Peggy Hill. Barack Obama had just entered the White House, Hank was a younger man with an exciting adventure ahead of him and all was, if not quite well with the world, certainly at least explicable. But now? Season 14 of this revived, beloved animated sitcom is upon us, feeling anachronistic yet also oddly timely. It’s like reconnecting with a group of old friends and realising that, while they are much as they always were, the context in which you now see them has altered beyond all recognition.Playing slightly against cartoon convention, the Hills’ lives have moved on. Unlike, for example, the ageless Simpsons, everyone is visibly older. In the intervening years, the propane industry has taken Hank and Peggy to Saudi Arabia. As we rejoin them, they are on the plane home. Hank has been in the toilet for hours because, as Peggy sees fit to inform the other passengers, “he now has the urethra of a seven-year-old”. When they touch down in Texas, Hank kisses the ground. But will he recognise the place?As they drive around their neighbourhood, Hank has a realisation. Their gated community in Saudi Arabia was “more Texan than Texas”. The US has exported an idealised version of its past especially for the ex-pats, even as the country itself has transformed beyond all recognition. King of the Hill always did subtle political messaging, wrapping pointed observations in the gentleness of the comedy.Hank is quickly back on familiar territory, standing by the fence outside his home, sharing a beer with his old pals. Bill has let himself go, badly. Boomhauer is still mumbly, but now has a similarly mumbly child. He greets Hank with a slightly surprising hug. As a man who still expresses his love for his son by offering to check the oil in his car, Hank finds this awkward. But as ever, the writing brings a remarkable amount of nuance to these simply but carefully constructed characters. Even in retirement, Hank is working through a few things.Dale, though, is a different keg of beer altogether. He hasn’t learned anything; instead the world has come around to him. Back in the day, Dale’s fondness for conspiracy theories made him the butt of the jokes. He doesn’t seem like such a harmless eccentric any more, though. Needless to say, he references “the pandumbic”. Hank, though, is old school and old media; he had access only to Fox News and CNN while in Saudi Arabia – although he feels he has to apologise for having watched CNN.Hank is a Republican – during the show’s original run, his response to learning that he was driving through Bill Clinton’s home town was to lock his car doors. But this adds real poignancy to the new iteration of the show. Much has changed in the US and not everything to Hank’s satisfaction, with one of those things being public discourse.At one point, Hank, Peggy and Dale go on a museum tour themed around George W Bush during which they are offered the chance to role-play a cabinet meeting. However, it degenerates into wild fiction as participants start ranting about “Obama’s Kenyan handler”. Dale is no longer an outlier – he’s now a thought-leader. Mike Judge’s and Greg Daniels’s writing perspective is evident here: Hank longs for an old, moderate America that couldn’t always agree, but could at least accept shared terms of reference within which they could argue.There is, however, a kindness to King of the Hill, which finds equal expression alongside the show’s occasional disquiet. There is charm and progress in its apparently changeless setting. The Hills’ son, Bobby, was once a chubby, geeky misfit. Happily, he has been given an upgrade that feels at once generous, eccentric and earned. He is a chef at a Japanese restaurant and Hank’s and Bobby’s familial battles are now fought via the proxies of food and drink. Hank and Bobby enter a brewing contest. “It’s just a friendly contest between father and son,” says Hank. “Where the father will kick his son’s ass.” Father and son receive a necessary lesson in humility.There remains a lightness and ease to these exchanges. Fittingly, as is the case with most longstanding relationships, the old rhythms return almost immediately, for the Hills and for viewers. Often, King of the Hill drifts toward the neat and the saccharin. It’s not a show that will ever hold back on the hugging and learning. But that feels entirely deliberate; at the moment, a show prioritising modesty, tolerance and gentle revelation feels more welcome than ever.King of the Hill is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

She might flog that to you tooTue 5 Aug 2025 08.13 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 21.31 EDTShare“SORRY FOR HAVING GREAT TITS AND CORRECT OPINIONS.” Not my words, readers (although, having said that …), but the words of a sweatshirt worn across the aforementioned acclaimed rack ofSydney Sweeneylast year, shortly after some madly overheated controversy or other involving the Euphoria/Anyone But You star. I forget which controversy. Like Marvel movies, too many Sydney Sweeney controversies were made, and they all seemed to connect to each other in ways no one but the truly initiated could understand, so now only the saddos turn out for each and every one.You might dimly be aware there’s another one going on at the moment, following Sydney’s participation in anAmerican Eagle denim advert– a fashion retail event which obviously spiralled into some fatuous blue jeans/red state flame-war that has seen deranged TikTokers claim something about “eugenics”, the president trouser-rubbingly decide he likes Sydney Sweeney and American Eagle sharesclimb 23%in a week. Tell me the US will still be Earth’s dominant superpower in 30 years because I simply DON’T want to hear anything else. This is the behaviour of a culture with legs. (And a perfect ass, sorry if you can’t handle it.)Anyway, aside from the white supremacist lunacy, there is frothing disquiet about the extent of Sweeney’s commercial brand partnerships, which include Miu Miu, Armani Beauty and a men’s grooming product firm for which she recently did a tongue-in-cheek ad to flog soap that contained trace elements of her bathwater. It all seems quite a lot of lucrative fun, which must, of course, be stamped on, particularly when it seems to be being had by a woman.I had to laugh at the intervention in a New York Times article of thefashion analystwho said: “It seems like she’s not embarrassed or ashamed by promoting all of these different projects.” Oh my God. Imagine! In fact, that explicit mention of shame reminded me of something that I’d read last year in the Guardian, which described Sydney Sweeney as “problematic yet unashamed”. I do so enjoy these funny ways of talking – although perhaps one’s not supposed to?I certainlygenuinelyloved the moment last year when Sweeney offered Vanity Fair a temperature check on the aspirational sisterhood of … hang on, let me get my reading glasses on … the Hollywood movie business. “This entire industry, all people say is ‘women empowering other women’,”Sydney explained. “None of it’s happening. All of it is fake and a front for all the other shit that they say behind everyone’s back.” Oof. Ladies and gentlemen, she went there. And how can you not love it? Chalk up another correct opinion and just accept that Sydney might not now get cast in a strong-female-led film based on a kids’ book, inspired by a theme-park ride or commissioned by a toy company.View image in fullscreenA digital display of Sydney Sweeney outside an American Eagle store in Times Square, New York City, 4 August 2025.Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty ImagesAs for Sydney’s online adversaries, what is it that cliched enemy characters say in the movies? “You and I, we are not so different after all.” Fact is, Sydney Sweeney is an actor. She wants attention. And – newsflash – so does some dreary TikToker making the nutty claim that American Eagle has done a white supremacist advert. They’re just a million miles less good at it than Sydney.Unless, of course, my other theory is true: that there are masses of undercover Maga agents whose sole job is to pose as woke warriors and say things so provocatively dumb that they further degrade the already cratered global reputation of the American left. Or, to couch it in their preferred language: if the vice-president and Fox News seize delightedly and profitably upon the usefully idiotic things you say, then it’s just possible you are in your least desirable location – “the wrong side of history”. Or, to put it in even more basic terms: YOU ARE NOT HELPING.Furthermore – and perhaps even more importantly – you are making the world less amusing. What you have failed to understand is something that us normies know instinctively. Namely, that this is how we want our celebrities, and most particularly our movie stars, to act. Most ordinary people want – and have always wanted – their movie stars to be gorgeous, fantastical, completely ridiculous figures in any number of ways, or else they’d be the most boring thing in the world: just like us.Sydney Sweeney’s Republican voter registration revealed amid jeans ad controversyRead moreWe want our movie stars to be “unashamedly” hot. We want our movie stars to tell us that they literally have to sell their own bathwater to eat, then find out they have aproperty empirethat includes but is not limited to a $3m house in Westwood, a $6m house in Bel Air and a $13.5m house on a private Floridian island with a 520-bottle wine cellar, an aquarium and an infinity pool with a swim-up bar.Of course, not everyone’s a normie. It will have come to your attention that there are some people out there who want celebrities to drone on about causes, to post like it makes the blindest bit of difference and to hold fundraisers for Joe Biden till it’s miles too late. But these people are strategically bankrupt, don’t really have a cultural hinterland and should largely be avoided at parties.Listen, five years ago, a commercially instinctive Sydney Sweeney would have done a feminist stunt or a tweet about mental health. Plenty of stars did, and made plenty from them. But nothing’s static and vibes change, so stars are doing different starry things now. Or to put it another way: they’re all in the infinity pool, but some of them are headed for the swim-up bar. That’s showbiz – try not to choke on it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Starmer must find the courage to change courseEd DaveyPoll after poll shows most voters think leaving the EU has been a failure. Closer ties with Europe would bring huge rewardsTue 5 Aug 2025 10.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 12.50 EDTShareBrexit isn’t working, and the British people know it. Poll after poll, including thatunveiled this weekendby More In Common for the Sunday Times, shows thatpeople are feeling the terrible damagecaused by the deal forced upon us by Boris Johnson, Kemi Badenoch and the rest of the Conservative party, and want something different. The latest shows less than a third of Britons would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were repeated.There’s no doubt that fundamental change is needed. There’s no doubt the public will is there to make it happen. The question is: will Keir Starmer seize the moment and deliver it?There are big prizes on offer if he does. Giving our economy the boost it desperately needs, pulling it out of the cycle of low growth and high debt that the Conservatives plunged us into. Helping to raise more funding to lift our NHS and other public services off their knees. And, crucially, showing people that there is a better, more hopeful way forward than the nasty, nonsensical “solutions” they hear from Nigel Farage and his fellow snake-oil salespeople on the right.Because people are, understandably, fed up. After so many failures of Conservative andLabourgovernments, people’s faith in politics is at an all-time low. Many people just don’t believe that any government of any party can really make their lives better. And beyond our shores, they see a world rife with conflict and instability, making it even harder to envisage our domestic challenges being solved.It’s no surprise that all this disillusionment is fuelling the rise of rightwing populists such as Farage. Restoring faith in politics is critical if we are to save our country from a Reform UK-Conservative coalition of chaos. And acting decisively to fix our broken relationship withEuropeis Starmer’s big chance.To be fair, the prime minister has made some tentative steps in the right direction. He has at least shown a willingness to take a more positive and pragmatic approach to Europe than his Conservative predecessors. He has talked about ayouth mobility schemeand bringing down trade barriers in key sectors such as farming and energy.But so far, all these amount to little more than promises to “work towards” new deals. For all the smiles at the“reset” summitin May, there’s very little in the way of concrete progress to date. Like so much of this government’s record, it risks becoming too much like “continuity Sunak”: all process and promises, no real change. But with growth still flatlining, Donald Trump wreaking havoc on the global economy and populism on the march, this challenge is much too urgent for such timidity.Of course, we know why Starmer has been reluctant to go further. He’s spooked by the combined threat of the Conservatives and Reform, both of whom are itching for the chance to plunge Britain back into the nastyBrexitwars of the past decade. Well, I say let them try. With so many serious problems in need of urgent solutions, the British people have absolutely no appetite for all that division and distraction, and they will have no truck with politicians who do.The way to see off the populist right isn’t to cower in its shadow; it’s to step up and offer a compelling, positive alternative. So what does that look like? The first thing the prime minister should do is raise his sights when it comes to negotiating with the EU. This can’t be about the odd limited improvement for this sector here or that sector there. The government has to be far more ambitious than just trying to polish up the rough edges of Johnson’s bad deal.Just imagine if, instead, the prime minister set a clear target of leading the UK into a new customs union with the EU by 2030. That could be truly transformative. It’s the single biggest thing the government could do to turbocharge our economy in the medium and long term. It would set us firmly on the path back to the single market, with all the benefits that would bring. It would be a game-changer – not just for our economy, but for the future of British politics.And not only that. A clear commitment to work towards a customs union would unlock big benefits for the UK now. It would give us the power to finally sign a veterinary and plant health agreement to boost British farming, and secure that youth mobility scheme to give our young people incredible new opportunities to live, work and travel across Europe, while also helping British employers to recruit the workers they need.Or even something less headline-grabbing but potentially just as impactful, such as joining theEuropean UnionAviation Safety Agency. Post-Brexit rules mean that air cargo firms – such as the one run by a constituent of mine – can’t have repair work done in Europe, apart from by the single German workshop that is recognised by the UK. It means they have to fly their planes all the way to the US just to get them serviced – at huge expense.With a more ambitious approach to Europe, we could get rid of that ridiculous red tape, and so much more like it. We could free British businesses to get on with their work, create jobs and grow our economy. That is the real change people across the country are crying out for. The opportunity is there and the rewards are great. I really hope the prime minister is listening.Ed Davey is the leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for Kingston and SurbitonExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionForeign policyEuropeKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

And it should be said that as an essay in alternative existences and parallel realities, this film and Curtis’s starring role are far more interesting than the bafflingly overrated Oscar-winner Everything Everywhere All at Once.The preceding film, from 2003, had Curtis and Lohan as a quarrelling mother and daughter who swap bodies due to the hilarious magical otherness of Chinese fortune cookies. (In 2025, the new version is a bit culturally lairy of gags like that.) It is based on Mary Rodgers’s 1972 novel, first filmed in 1976 with Jodie Foster as the daughter, a formidably precocious young star who was in those days considered to be already body-swapped into fierce adulthood. The publicity for this film promises legacy cameos and when one teen character talks about her French boyfriend, many FF fans will have been excitably wondering if this French boyfriend has a French-speaking mom played by a certain French-speaking star?In this new contemporary reality, written by Jordan Weiss and directed by Nisha Ganatra, Curtis’s character Tess Coleman is a grandma, therapist and parenting podcaster, and her once-tearaway daughter, Lohan’s character Anna, is a music producer and single mom to a Gen-Z teen; this is Harper, played by Julia Butters, a young actor still legendary for her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Tarantino’sOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.‘Generations of women have been disfigured’: Jamie Lee Curtis lets rip on plastic surgery, power, and Hollywood’s age problemRead moreWhen Harper has a big fight in school with her obnoxious, princess-y British lab partner, Lily (played by non-Briton Sophia Hammons), she is horrified when Anna falls hard for Lily’s hot single dad Eric (Manny Jacinto); these enemies are both appalled at the prospect of becoming stepsisters. This situation becomes even more complicated – freakier in fact – when a zany palm reader and fortune teller triggers a new cosmic body-swap nightmare, this time involving four women, not two.Another version of this movie might have wanted to dip its toe into the issues of body image and identity: Freakier Friday keeps it light, partly as a result of Curtis’s jokey grandma, in whose knockabout generational presence there is no question of anything tricky. Curtis gets the laughs with her puppyishly uninhibited performance and there are some great gags, including one at the expense of oldsters who use a certain social media platform. There are also some amusing contributions from SNL trouper Vanessa Bayer as the fortune teller, comedian X Mayo as the school’s dyspeptic principal and Santina Muha as a US official who has to assess the authenticity of Anna and Eric’s marriage.As for Lohan, she does a reasonable job, although her own body-swapped status as the legendary wild-child of old who is now playing a stressed middle-aged person has to remain unemphasised, simply because Lohan doesn’t really have the comedy chops. It’s Curtis who embodies the story’s wacky spirit.Freakier Friday is out on 7 August in Australia and 8 August in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsJamie Lee CurtisLindsay LohanComedyFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A patchwork of concrete shapes and shattered walls, neighbourhoods scattered with craters, rubble and roads that lead nowhere. The remnants of cities wiped out.But here, there has been no natural disaster and no slow passage of time.Gaza was a bustling, living place until less than two years ago, for all the challenges its residents endured even then. Its markets were crowded, its streets were full of children. That Gaza is gone – not buried under volcanic ash, not erased by history, but razed by an Israeli military campaign that has left behind a place that looks like the aftermath of an apocalypse.View image in fullscreenMembers of Jordan’s military stand among pallets of aid about to be dropped on GazaThe Guardian was granted permission on Tuesday to travel onboard a Jordanian military aircraft providing aid. Israel announced last week that it had resumed coordinated humanitarian airdrops over Gaza, following mounting international pressure over severe shortages of food and medical supplies, which has reached such a crisis point that a famine is now unfolding there.The flight offered not only a chance to witness three tonnes of aid – far from sufficient – dropped over the famine-stricken strip but also a rare opportunity to observe, albeit from above, a territory that has been largely sealed off from the international media since 7 October and the subsequent offensive launched by Israel. Following the Hamas-led attacks that day, Israel barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been denied access to an active war zone.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGaza Strip from the aid plane; view of northern Gaza; the distortion in the last picture is due to the heat emitted by the aircraft enginesEven from an altitude of about 2,000ft (600 metres), it was possible to glimpse places that mark some of the conflict’s most devastating chapters – a landscape etched with the scars of its deadliest attacks.These are the sites of bombings and sieges that have been courageously documented by Palestinian journalists – often at the cost of their own lives. More than 230 Palestinian reporters lie buried beneath in hastily dug cemeteries.View image in fullscreenAirdrops released from the planeAbout an hour and a half after takeoff, the plane flies over the ruins of northern Gaza and Gaza City, now a wasteland of crumbling concrete and dust. Buildings are reduced to rubble, roadways pitted with craters, entire neighbourhoods flattened. From this distance it is nearly impossible to see Gaza’s inhabitants. Only through a nearly-400mm camera lens is it possible to make out a small group of people standing among the ruins of a shattered landscape – the only sign of life in a place that appears otherwise uninhabitable.As the aircraft approaches the Nuseirat refugee camp, the rear hatch opens and pallets of aid slide out, parachutes blooming behind as they fall toward the ground.Aid is released during the airdrop.Aid is released during the airdrop.“With today’s airdrops, the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army has now conducted 140 airdrop operations, in addition to 293 in cooperation with other countries, delivering 325 tonnes of aid to Gaza since the resumption of airdrops on 27 July,” a note from the Jordanian military reads.Yet such quantities are nowhere close to being enough. Humanitarian agencies warn that hunger is spreading rapidly through the territory. While airdrops can create the perception that something is being done, they are, by common consensus, costly, inefficient and do not get anywhere near to the amount of aid that could be delivered by lorries. In the first 21 months of war, 104 days of airdrops supplied the equivalent of just four days of food for Gaza,Israeli data shows.Graphic showing quantity of aid airdropped into Gaza in 2023-24They can also be deadly; at least 12 people drowned last year trying to recover food that landed in the sea, and at least five were killed when pallets fell on them.Farther south, the plane passes over Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. There, in the Baraka area below, on 22 May, 11-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, known asGaza’s youngest social media influencer, was killed after a series of heavy Israeli airstrikes hit her house while she watered flowers in a tiny patch of greenery eked out of a displacement camp.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPallets parachute down after being dropped from a military plane over NuseiratA couple of kilometres further, the aircraft flies near Khan Younis, besieged for months by Israeli forces amid fierce fighting in and around its hospitals. Somewhere in the northern suburbs are the remains of the home of Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a Palestinian paediatrician who worked at al-Tahrir hospital, part of the Nasser medical complex.Her house was bombed in Maywhile she was on shift. Her husband and nine of her 10 children were killed in the attack.From the skies, it is striking just how small Gaza is – a sliver of land that has become the stage for one of the world’s bloodiest conflicts. The territory is more than four times smaller than Greater London. In this tiny corner of the Middle East, more than 60,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, according to health authorities. Thousands more are estimated to remain buried under the rubble.1:10Gaza before and after: new video shows extent of Israel's destruction – videoA few hundred metres beneath us, the Guardian reporter Malak A Tantesh, a journalist and a survivor, works on one of her dispatches. Most of her fellow reporters, editors and other colleagues are yet to meet Tantesh, owing to the Israeli blockade that makes it impossible for Gaza’s people to leave. She has been displaced multiple times, lives without reliable access to food or water, and has lost relatives, friends and her home in the fighting. It is a strange and haunting feeling to receive a message from her as the Jordanian aircraft flies above.Map illustrating flight pathAs our aircraft turns back toward Jordan, a soldier onboard points toward the hazy horizon to the south. “That’s Rafah down there,” he says.Gaza’s southernmost area, Rafah is a region now largely destroyed, where hundreds have died in the scramble for food since the Israeli- and US-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundationtook over food deliveries in May. Just a few kilometres to the east, amid crater-pocked hills, lies the site where, on 23 March, an Israeli military unit struck a convoy of Palestinian emergency vehicles,killing 15 medics and rescue workerswho were later buried in a mass grave.After touching down at Jordan’s King Abdullah II airbase in Ghabawi, the same question seems to linger among the handful of reporters who boarded the flight: when will we see Gaza again?And after seeing this desert of shattered stones and graves, what more can be destroyed when so much has already been lost?View image in fullscreenPalestinians rush to collect humanitarian aid airdropped by the United Arab Emirates into Deir al-BalahExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It means if the chancellor wants to maintain a buffer of £9.9bn then she will have to find £51.1bn, either in extra taxes or lower spending or both, annually, by 2029-30.”He said NIESR recommended a bigger buffer. “To do that requires a moderate but sustained increase in taxes.”Last month the chancellor warned ministers that taxes would have to rise after the government scrapped restrictions on welfare payments, without indicating which taxes would be affected.There is already a long queue of claims by public sector workers for higher wage rises, adding to already rising pressures on the public purse that includes higher spending on immigration and the courts system to defence and education.Backbench Labour MPs, emboldened after successful campaigns against cuts to winter fuel allowance and disability support payments, are expected to challenge the Labour leadership if manifesto spending pledges are scrapped in the budget to reduce the deficit.NIESR said its updated analysis from the spring meant it expected the Bank of England to reduce the cost of borrowing from 4.25% to 3.75% by the end of the year, but the cuts will arrive too late to boost growth.Speculation has mounted over which taxes Reeves will raise, with current favourites anextension to the freeze on income tax bands and a cut to the current cash Isa limit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will require a determined attempt to rebuild the fiscal buffer and that will inevitably involve gradual but sustained tax increases or spending cuts.”A projection by the Office forBudgetResponsibility (OBR), the government independent forecaster, to coincide with the chancellor’s spring statement in March showed the deficit falling in the 2025-26 financial year.However, official figures have shown public finances already beginning to veer off track since April. Across the first three months of fiscal year 2025-2026, the budget deficit was £44.5bn, £5bn higher than the OBR’s forecast.A Conservative spokesperson, Mel Stride, blamed the government for mismanaging the economy and “always reaching for the tax rise lever because they don’t understand the economy”.He said: “Businesses are closing, unemployment is up, inflation has doubled and the economy is shrinking. And Labour are refusing to rule out more damaging tax rises on investment.”Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingRachel ReevesEconomic policyLabourBudgetThinktanksIncome taxnewsShareReuse this content"

It said the then trustees’ failure to resolve disputes internally had “severely impacted the charity’s reputation and risked undermining public trust in charities more generally”.David Holdsworth, the chief executive of the Charity Commission, said: “Sentebale’s problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity’s reputation, risk[ing] overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising the charity’s ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve.“This case highlights what can happen when there are gaps in governance and policies critical to charities’ ability to deliver for their cause. As a result, we have issued the charity a Regulatory Action Plan to make needed improvements and rectify findings of mismanagement.”In response to the report, a spokesperson for Harry, who was not a trustee and established the charity in memory of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, criticised the commission, claiming its report had fallen “troublingly short”.The commission found that a serious dispute between Chandauka and Harry had followed the formulation of a new fundraising strategy in the US. The breakdown in the relationship had been raised with the commission in February but an investigation was only opened in April after an analysis.Accusations and resignations mark remarkable 24 hours at charity founded by Prince HarryRead moreThe commission did not find evidence of widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir, it said, but acknowledged “the strong perception of ill treatment felt by a number of parties to the dispute and the impact this may have had on them personally”.It further found no evidence of “‘overreach’ by either the chair or the Duke of Sussex as patron” but the commission was “critical of the charity’s lack of clarity in delegations to the chair which allowed for misunderstandings to occur”.It said: “The commission’s assessment of the various accounts that have been provided is that all the charity’s then trustees contributed to a missed opportunity to resolve issues which led to the dispute.“The regulator observed that strategic and financial difficulties that had emerged for the charity following the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to the tensions that arose.”A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said: “Unsurprisingly, the commission makes no findings of wrongdoing in relation to Sentebale’s co-founder and former patron, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.“They also found no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment or misogyny and misogynoir at the charity, as falsely claimed by the current chair.“Despite all that, their report falls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the fact that the consequences of the current chair’s actions will not be borne by her – but by the children who rely on Sentebale’s support.“Sentebale has been a deeply personal and transformative mission for Prince Harry, established to serve some of the most vulnerable children in Lesotho and Botswana.”A spokesperson for Sentebale said they were pleased with the action plan offered by the commission, which would allow it to “move forward … free from interference”.Chandauka said: “The unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviours displayed in private.“We are emerging not just grateful to have survived, but stronger: more focused, better governed, boldly ambitious and with our dignity intact.“Despite the recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our founders, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who established Sentebale in memory of their precious mothers, Princess Diana and Queen ‘Mamohato.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryAfricaCharitiesVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

The prevalence of low mental wellbeing for those who had experienced no abuse stood at 16%, rising to 22.5% for physical abuse, 24% for verbal abuse, and 29% for both physical and verbal abuse.Furthermore, the prevalence of physical abuse halved from about 20% among those born between 1950 and 1979 to 10% among participants born in or after 2000. However, for verbal abuse, the prevalence increased from 12% among those born before 1950 to about 20% among those born in 2000 or later.These findings add to previous research that found experiencing childhood verbal abuse waslinked to a higher risk of self-harm, drug use, and ending up in jail.“Our study reveals that degrading, humiliating and abusive language directed at children can have long-term mental health impacts at least as severe as those associated with physical abuse,” said Prof Mark Bellis of Liverpool John Moores University, the study’s lead author.“Equally concerning is the trend observed over the study period where physical abuse declined but verbal abuse increased … potentially offsetting the mental health gains we might expect from reduced exposure to physical harm.”The authors of the study acknowledged its limitations, namely that they were unable to measure the severity of either type of abuse, or the reasons for these trends in changing prevalence for physical and verbal abuse.“Although this study does not examine the reasons for these trends, it is vital that we do not simply replace one form of childhood trauma with another,” Bellis added. “That’s why we must go beyond telling parents what not to do, and instead offer clear, practical support and guidance that allows them to raise their children through healthy, nurturing relationships.”The analysis also found that participants born in 2000 or later had a higher likelihood of overall low mental wellbeing, while men were more likely to report never or rarely feeling optimistic, useful, or close to people, while women were more likely to report never or rarely feeling relaxed.Jessica Bondy, founder of Words Matter, a charity with the aim of ending childhood verbal abuse, said the study confirmed that “words can wound deeply and have a lasting impact on a child’s mental health and development”.She added: “Any gains made in reducing physical abuse risk being undone by rising rates of verbal abuse. We must act now to confront the lasting harm caused by cruel, critical or controlling language. We need to build children up – not knock them down. The mental health of the next generation and our shared future depend on it.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenChild protectionParents and parentingFamilyResearchMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

It will be spent on improving youth club infrastructure, including new gym equipment and climbing walls, in areas with high levels of child poverty and support youth work in areas with high rates of antisocial behaviour.The funds will also support local authorities to provide high-quality out-of-school activities and create thousands of places in youth organisations such as the Scouts, the Guides and the Volunteer Police Cadets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told the BBC that the series shone a light “on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn into this world”.Ministers are preparing to publish a national youth strategy in the autumn.

Their publication comes amid intense speculation aroundDonald Trump’s ties to Epstein, who was found dead in a New York jail in 2019 and had long cultivated a celebrity social circle of the rich and powerful.In one letter, former prime minister of Israel Ehud Barak and his wife wrote “there is no limit to your curiosity.”US House panel subpoenas Bill and Hillary Clinton for Epstein testimonyRead more“You are like a closed book to many of them but you know everything about everyone,” they wrote, describing Epstein as “A COLLECTOR OF PEOPLE”.They continued: “May you enjoy long and healthy life and may all of us, your friends, enjoy your table for many more years to come.”In aletterfrom film-maker Woody Allen, Allen reminisced about Epstein’s dinner parties at his Upper East Side townhouse and described the gatherings as “always interesting”. He noted that the parties included “politicians, scientists, teachers, magicians, comedians, intellectuals, journalists” and “even royalty”.Allen also described the dinners as “well served”: “I say well served – often it’s by some professional houseman and just as often by several young women” who he said reminded him of “Castle Dracula where Lugosi has three young female vampires who service the place.”Other letter writers reportedly included billionaire media mogulMortimer Zuckerman;Noam Chomsky and his wife;Joichi Ito, the former head of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Media Lab; physicist Lawrence M Krauss; and Harvard biologist and mathematician Martin Nowak.Allen, Ito, Zuckerman and Nowakdid not respondto requests for comment from the Times. Barak reportedly declined to comment, and Chomsky’s wife responded on his behalf, also declining to comment. Krauss reportedly told the Times that he didn’t recall the letter but did attend “several lunches with very interesting discussions” with scientists, authors and others at Epstein’s house.In addition to the letters, the Times also published photos from inside Epstein’s seven-story Manhattan mansion.In his office, the images show a taxidermied tiger and reportedly show a green first edition copy of Lolita – the controversial 1955 novel about a middle-aged man’s sexual obsession with and sexual abuse and rape of a 12-year-old girl – which the Times said was “showcased”.Surveillance cameras can be seen in Epstein’s bedroom and an adjoining room. In his “massage room”, where many underaged victimssaidthat they weresexually assaulted by Epstein, the Times reports that there were paintings of naked women, shelves of lubricant, and a large silver ball and chain.Elsewhere in the house, dozens of framed photographs show Epstein pictured alongside longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. They also pictured Epstein with notable figures such as Pope John Paul II, Mick Jagger, Elon Musk, Fidel Castro, Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Richard Branson, Saudi Arabia crown prince Mohammed bin Salman and former Trump White House adviser, Steve Bannon.One frame also displayed a dollar bill signed by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates with the message “I was wrong!” which the Times said was “possibly as payment of a bet”.The Times also reported that the home’s entryway featured framed prosthetic eyeballs, and that a suspended sculpture of a woman wearing a bridal gown and clutching a rope hung in the central atrium.According to the Times, a map of Israel drawn on a chalkboard that had the signature of former Israeli prime minister Barak was also in the home.Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.The renewed scrutiny into Epstein’s case comes as Trump and members of his administration had repeatedly vowed to release information related to the Epstein investigations.But in July, the administration reversed course, and the justice departmentannouncedit would not releaseany further documents or details regarding the case, prompting bipartisanoutrage, including fromTrump supportersandconservative media figures.Epstein’s case has long been the subject ofcountless conspiracy theories, in part due to his ties to powerful people. His 2019 suicide has also fueled conspiracy theories for years.The justice department’s recent announcement also reignited scrutiny of Trump’syears-long friendship with Epstein.In July,the Wall Street Journal reportedthat Trump allegedly wrote Epstein a birthday card as part of a 50th birthday album organized by Maxwell in 2003.According to the report, Trump’s letter featured a sketch of a naked woman with Trump’s signature. Trump denied the Journal’s report andsued thenewspaper for libel.Around a week layer,the Journalreported that justice department officials had informed Trump earlier this year that his name appeared in the Epstein files. The paper noted that being mentioned in the records isn’t a sign of wrongdoing. Trump’s spokesperson denied the report, calling it “fake news”.Facing growing pressure, the justice department sent Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general and one of Trump’s former lawyers, tomeet with Maxwellin late July to see whether she had “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims”.The meeting,which lasted two days, was held behind closed doors. On Friday,Maxwell was transferred from a Florida prisonto a lower-security facility in Texas.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinWoody AllenNew York TimesNewspapersnewsShareReuse this content"

This week, tech companies are spending amounts of money that stretch the limits of the imagination. Donald Trump’s administration is spending more money with data analytics and surveillance firmPalantir. And women on both sides of the Pacific face the extreme difficulty of keeping intimate moments private online.Update: the trillion-dollar AI race, part IIInlast week’s edition of the newsletter, my colleagues wrote about the upshot of Google’s earnings call: lots of money earned, but, more importantly lots of money spent on AI. Even more money shelled out than previously expected: Google revised its predictions for how much it would invest in building up its AI capacity upwards by billions. Investors loved it. Shares up.In the ensuing week, three more tech giants reported their quarterly earnings –Meta, Microsoft and Amazon – and disclosed that they have collectively spent $155bn. Investors expressed elation at the colossal sums. Meta’s market capitalization shot up by more than $130bn. Microsoft’s valuation soared past $4tn, making the software giant the second publicly traded company to reach that stratospheric milestone. Amazon’s financial outlook was murkier, and its shares went down. What a bummer to miss out on the AI stock party.The $155bn sum represents more than the US government has spent oneducation, training, employment and social servicesin the 2025 fiscal year so far. One economics research firm claims AI spending hascontributed more to the US economyover the past two quarters than consumer spending, traditionally the biggest factor in economic growth.For the coming fiscal year, big tech’s total capital expenditure is slated to balloon enormously, surpassing the already eye-popping sums of the previous year. Microsoft plans to unload about $100bn on AI in the next fiscal year, CEO Satya Nadella said. Meta plans to spend between $66bn and $72bn. Alphabet plans to spend $85bn, significantly higher than its previous estimation of $75bn. Amazon estimated that its 2025 expenditure would come to $100bn as it plows money into Amazon Web Services, which analysts now expect to amount to $118bn. In total, the four tech companies will spend more than $400bn on capex in the coming year, according to theWall Street Journal.Read more about the gargantuan sums of money being spent on AI.Where does Palantir have contracts?View image in fullscreenThe Palantir logo at the New York stock exchange.Photograph: Andrew Kelly/ReutersLast week, the US army announced a new agreement with Palantir, the Peter Thiel-founded, Alex Karp-run technology company.The agreement combined 75 separate, existing contracts between the army and Palantir into one, and allows for the possibility to purchase goods and services up to $10bn.It’s just one of dozens of agreements between the company and the US, a relationship that’s only been growing rapidly in the second Trump administration, though it had been on the rise before then. Palantir brought in $373m in revenue from US government contracts in just the first quarter of 2025 – $151.6m more than a year prior. The vast majority of that increase – $148.7m – came from government customers who were already working with the company, according to its earnings reports.Here’s an overview of Palantir’s biggest US government contracts:Department: DefenseWorth: The Department of Defense lists its “obligations” to Palantir as$1.66bnin the government, which can encompass current and future spending, according to theUS government’s database of its own spending.Financial analystsestimate Palantir earns $400m in annual recurring revenue from the DoD.The details: The DoD remains Palantir’s biggest and oldest customer within the US federal government. The first contract between the two dates back to 2008.The army has made no commitment and is under no obligation to purchase anywhere close to the $10bn figure listed as the value of its new agreement with Palantir, which represents the “maximum potential value of the contract”, according to the press release the government published. The number is not exactly money in hand for Palantir, but analysts seem encouraged it could represent a major source of revenue and more business from the US government.“It’s no obligation but we believe the army will spend billions with Palantir with this contract,” said Dan Ives, managing director at the wealth management firm Wedbush Securities.Department: Homeland SecurityWorth: $256.7m in obligationsDetails: The company has been working with the homeland security department since 2011. The vast majority of Palantir’s contracts with DHS are to provide services to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice. These amount to $248.3m in obligations. The company’s most recent contract with Ice was for $30m to make the deportation process more efficient.Department: Health and Human ServicesWorth: $385m in obligationsDepartment: TreasuryWorth: $140.9mDepartment: JusticeWorth: $204.5mDepartment: EnergyWorth: $91mskip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In China, hundreds of thousands of men are sharing explicit pictures without the consent of the women in the photos.The app in the US, Tea, offered a forum for women who subscribed to share past experiences with men so that other women could conduct DIY background checks on their prospective dates, highlighting negative “red flags” and positive “green flags”. Tea’s owners bill the app as “the safest place to spill”, in reference to the English slang term for gossip. It has topped US download charts in recent weeks, and the company has boasted about a user base of 1.6 million women. It is only available in the US.The app promised “dating safety tools that protect women”. but in late July, the company discovered that hackers had breached its systems and leaked users’ driver’s licenses, direct messages and selfies. Users of the noxious message board 4Chan screenshotted and spread Tea users’ personal information,according to NPR. A second breach exposed more than a million messages sent by Tea’s users, including ones about sensitive topics like abortions or cheating, per404 Media, which first reported both breaches. The company claimed in a statement that the first breach only affected users who had signed up before February 2024, but the second one was much more recent, 404 reported. In response to the hack, the app has suspended messaging entirely, theBBCreported.Most data breaches inspire little public uproar. The exposure of an email address here, a birthday there can feel commonplace. The breach of Tea is different. The app promised safety as a core feature. It delivered the opposite. Thesine qua nonof a whisper network like Tea is privacy, the ability to share damning information in secret, which the app failed to protect. Exposing users’ identities and messages is the most basic type of failure, one that can be fatal to a product’s reputation. To make matters worse, the breach offers red meat to the male-dominated 4Chan forum, a node of incel culture and men’s rage in the US.“Our team remains fully engaged in strengthening the Tea app’s security, and we look forward to sharing more about those enhancements soon,” the company said in a statement to the BBC. “In the meantime, we are working to identify any users whose personal information was involved and will be offering free identity protection services to those individuals.”In China, women are facing down an online legion of men dedicated to invading their most private moments with spy cameras and sharing the results on the internet.My colleagueAmy Hawkinsreports:Anger is growing on Chinese social media after news reports revealed the existence of online groups, said to involve hundreds of thousands of Chinese men, which shared photographs of women, including sexually explicit ones, taken without their consent.The Chinese newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily published a report last week about a group on the encrypted messaging appTelegramcalled “MaskPark tree hole forum”. It said it had more than 100,000 members and was “comprised entirely of Chinese men”.Men reportedly shared sexually explicit images of women either in intimate settings or with so-called “pinhole cameras” that can be hidden in everyday items such as plug sockets and shoes.Read the full story.In aninfluential 2014 essay, “Why women aren’t welcome on the internet”, the writer Amanda Hess said that receiving countless graphic death and rape threats in response to her work did not make her exceptional: “It just makes me a woman with an internet connection.” Events of the past week indicate that Hess’s headline still holds true.Tim Berners-Lee, credited with inventing the world wide web, toldthe Guardianin 2020 that the internet “is not working for women and girls”. The same year, a Unesco report found that 73% of women journalists endured online threats to their safety. OtherUN reportshave found that significant portions of women across the world, somewhere between 16% and 58%, face threats of gender-based violence online.Explore more on these topicsMetaTechScape newsletterPalantirMark ZuckerbergPrivacyWomenInternet safetynewslettersShareReuse this content"

After years of making ends meet with bit parts, background artist work and pornography, he wrote and starred in Rockyin 1976, breaking into mainstream success. Before long he had carved out a new niche, writing, directing, and acting himself into stardom with a string of tough-guy movies including two hugely successful Rocky sequels.Then came Rambo. The character is peak 80s Stallone, a byword for pure testosterone. An absurd, improbably muscular slab of ham with a headband and an M60 machine gun, spraying bullets at racial caricatures in a jungle or a desert somewhere.Which is a shame, because the original film is truly great.First Blood – the 1982 flick that launched a five-part franchise spanning almost four decades – is one of those films that isn’t what people think it is. It’s easy to conflate it with the torrent of other Stallone guff from the 80s – namely the film’s myriad sequels. Based on a novel by David Morrell and directed by Ted Kotcheff – who also madethe brutal Australian classic Wake in Fright–First Bloodis a film about PTSD, machismo, and the long aftermath of the Vietnam war.John Rambo is a drifter, a Vietnam vet without a purpose. His last war buddy has died from Agent Orange exposure, and he is unable to shut out the horrors. After being brutalised by police, he escapes custody and retreats to the woods, where his severe PTSD sends him into defensive bouts of violence as he maims everyone who comes after him.View image in fullscreen‘First Blood presents masculinity as a trap: a battle with no winners.’Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThe 70s were full of so-called “vetsploitation” films. Everything from high-end Oscar fodder like Taxi Driverto the notoriousBlackenstein– yes, Black Frankenstein – mined the trauma of returned Vietnam servicemen. Stallone emphasises Rambo’s transition from kind and gentle in the film’s opening scenes to distressed and vacant, a hunted animal. His former commanding officer Trautman (Richard Crenna) is called in to talk Rambo down like he’s a tricky piece of equipment that needs defusing.As with other action films from the era, First Blood is tragic and bloodthirsty, basking in masculine excess at the same time as condemning it. First Blood has almost no women in it; an actress who plays a pivotal role at the beginning of the film is uncredited, and bizarrely remains unidentified. This is men without women, and it’s ugly, destructive and tragic. A review of Morrell’s original First Blood noveldescribed it as “carnography”. Like Wake in Fright, First Blood presentsmasculinity as a trap: a battle with no winners.Stallone excels at playing a tragic hero. Both Rocky and Rambo are simple men with a talent for brutality, and a determination to go the distance. Both are plainly damaged by a world that only values them for their muscle. Neither knows when to stop. So of course there were sequels. But how do you make a sequel to such a complete, rounded story? Does Rambo join the anti-war movement? Lead a prison riot? Finally get that valet job?View image in fullscreen‘For John Rambo, the war is never over.’Photograph: Cinetext/Thorn Emi/AllstarThey went a different way. In the ensuing films, Rambo ventures on a series of top-secret missions in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Burma. As the American male grew bored of all that tiresome introspection, Rambo became a caricature, a walking action figure stuck in a string of delusional fantasies.And what’s the most logical next step for the story of a traumatised war vet who maims police officers? That’s right: a children’s animated series and accompanying toy range. Even Stallone was embarrassed aboutRambo: The Force of Freedom– the 1986 animated series in which our hero and his team take on the Specialist-Administrators of Vengeance, Anarchy and Global Extortion (that’s Savage for short).But I’ve figured the sequels out. They’re dream sequences. After a brief moment of self-awareness at the end of First Blood, Rambo descends into a deep, decades-long psychosis. For John Rambo, the war is never over.First Blood is available to stream on Prime Video, Stan and Binge in Australia and available to rent in the UK and US.

A globe of light emerges and vaguely spacey projections beam around the band as their electro-classical orchestration soars into life. From there, with no other interaction with the audience, the show struggles to gain much velocity.Freeze any moment of this performance and the snippet of synth-infused symphony you catch will have an otherworldly beauty. But in the room, with the band squashed awkwardly against the back wall so as to be caught in the projection’s light, the energy is halting. The action feels untethered from the space we occupy together, neither party quite sure what to expect from or offer the other.View image in fullscreenHalting energy … K Mak at the PlanetariumThe instruments are an easy extension of their players, the irrefutably accomplished musicians on drums, violin and cello sometimes closing their eyes as they lose themselves in the mournful music. The voice of K Mak, who is also on keys, comes to us first with heavy synths, her voice high and alien, her lyrics taking effort to unpick. Then she strips back the modulations to give us her voice unfiltered, her just-discernible words of love and longing making it equally possible that she’s speaking as a person as she is a star.Behind the performers, psychedelic projections veer from micro to macro, from abstract and tangible, with globular molecules and rushing comets colliding as if tilted through a kaleidoscope. These trippy visuals have the most impact when they feel tailored to the music, a burning flame around a black hole pulsating in time with the beat of a drum. But moving on to images of bouncing jellyfish and unfurling flowers, they begin to seem compiled at random. Losing any connection to outer space, they threaten to tip into the abstract bounce of a desktop screensaver. The music may be cosmically calming, but this performance lacks the intensity required to either truly ground or transport you.AtSummerhall, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Edinburgh festivalTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Their faces are obscure, their bodies intriguing under their shapeless work clothes. What age are they? How are they related? The man is quite young, his top shirt button loose, although his legs are as stiff as a doll’s, inside thick, rough-cut trousers. It’s harder to tell the woman’s age because she stands in profile, a breeze pressing her heavy skirt against her legs, as she clasps her hands. They might be a married couple or, as this painting’s unlikely fan Salvador Dalí claimed, mother and son. Their physicality is intense. The phallic prongs of a thick wooden potato fork and wheelbarrow shafts add to the feeling that, now the working day is done and they’re saying their prayers, they can finally get to bed. But if they’re mother and son? I refer you to Dr Dalí.View image in fullscreenHello Dalí … detail from The Angelus by Millet Jean-François.Photograph: Jean-François Millet/© Musée d’Orsay, Dist. Grand Palais Rmn / Patrice SchmidtI think there’s a reasonMillet makes The Angelus not so much a religious as an erotic landscape. It was the climax of his love affair with the French peasantry. Millet made it his life’s work to portray the rural poor – a class that had been denied full humanity. He depicts lives of backbreaking toil but wants you to see that, behind the hoe, is a human being with a mind, a body, desires.View image in fullscreenStark existential moments … The sower  by Jean-François Millet.Photograph: © Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum WalesLandscape artists often can’t draw the human figure for toffee: that means you, Constable and Turner. But Millet foregrounds the body in stark existential moments of sweaty action. Work that in reality must have been repetitive and mindless becomes full of heroic drama. In The Winnower, a man throws grains in the air in a golden mist to separate the wheat from the chaff. Painted at the time of the 1848 revolutions, when liberal and socialist risings were shaking the wheat from the chaff across Europe, the winnower is, you realise, wearing a reddish-pink bandana, a white shirt and has a blue handkerchief – the colours of the tricolour flag that the first French Revolution invented.Millet’s a revolutionary and his people have plenty to rebel against. In The Sower, a man is sowing seeds in a deep gully: it looks as if he has descended into hell. This pit looks completely barren yet here he is, sowing seeds anyway, the symbolism as hard to ignore as the arses of the two cows that loom against the stormy sky above him. His act may be that of a political campaigner, sowing seeds of change, yet it’s also an image of artistic creativity. The character could be Millet himself, creating something beautiful out of the brutal realities of rural toil.His autobiography is compacted into this small show. Millet was a country boy from Normandy. His painting The Well at Gruchy captures the world he grew up in – a woman fills pots of water from a stone-roofed well that appears to be centuries old. Life is slow there, in Gruchy, and history a massive, immobile presence. The Faggot Gatherers, which Millet was working on up to 1875, looks like a riposte to the impressionists’ emphasis on modernity and middle-class pleasures on boulevards and in cafes. Women lug bundles of sticks through Stygian winter gloom in a scene that could just as easily have been in the 1370s as the 1870s.View image in fullscreenSilent passions … The Goose Girl at Gruchy by Jean-François Millet.Photograph: © Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum WalesHe found one fan looking desperately for soul in the world. Vincent van Goghwanted to emulate Milletas a peasant painter. You see their deep connection in Millet’s drawing A Man Ploughing and Another Sowing. As the broken-looking sower stumbles in the foreground and a ploughman hunches behind him, a flock of black crows rise into the sky – like the birds Van Gogh would see over the wheatfield near the end of his life.Yet for all his brooding compassion, you can’t miss Millet’s turbulent sexuality. The two athletic men in his painting The Wood Sawyers look as if they are cutting up a giant penis. Then again, the slices of trunk also resemble freshly butchered meat – another one for Dalí. More conventionally sexualised are Millet’s portraits of shepherdesses and milkmaids. His painting The Goose Girl at Gruchy may be as much a memory of adolescent longings as a painting from life. Van Gogh in a frenzied letter claims Millet’s women are as sexy as Zola’s – you can see how he got to this and how much Millet’s fascination with the silent passions of country people has in common with Thomas Hardy’s novels.It all comes together in The Angelus, which you keep coming back to after scanning his other works. The scene it immortalises is ancient, the lives these people lived largely lost to history. Millet freezes them like statues. They grow like grass from the hard earth that can’t wait to take them back.Millet: Life on the Land is atthe National Gallery, London, from 7 August to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArt and designPaintingExhibitionsNational GalleryArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 5 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareI have just got a pizza oven, but what else can I cook in it?Sure, Neapolitan pizza and negroni nights are great, but start thinking of your pizza oven as a high-temperature furnace and there will be even more reason to stay outdoors. “I’d lean towards food that you eat charred,” says Naples-trained Kit Delamain ofCircus Pizzaat Panzer’s Deli in London. That might mean aubergines to blitz intobaba ganoush, finishing meat (think lamb) that’s been cooked low and slow “to get that really nice, charred flavour”, or to bake pitta: “They puff up ever so nicely, which is hard to achieve in a normal oven.” The same goes for pillowy naan, adds Arun Tilak, executive chef atDishoom: “Roll the dough into a round or oval shape, prick lightly with a fork and bake until beautifully golden. Brush with butter and you’re in for a treat.”Of course, pizza ovens come in different shapes and styles, but, depending on which you have, they can be “really controllable”, says Rachel Jones, founder ofACE Pizzain east London, who recently cooked a whole turbot in hers. “Start with that intense heat, which will blister the skin, before turning it down and leaving the fish to cook through.” That said, you could also have chicken tonight: “Spatchcock a chicken and marinate it in lemon zest, garlic, olive oil, rosemary and salt and pepper for at least an hour,” says Jones, who then pops the bird skin side up in a skillet and into the pizza oven on low, rotating occasionally, until cooked. “While the chicken rests, throw summer veg [courgettes, peppers, tomatoes] into the skillet with olive oil and garlic, and get that pan back in the oven.” Start the flame on high (“to get some nice char”), then turn to low and cook for another 15 minutes: “Serve with a squeeze of lemon, a scatter of fresh herbs, maybe a dollop of yoghurt and some flatbread on the side.”A pizza oven could facilitate curry night, too. “Cook chicken or vegetables in the pizza oven, then just add them to a homemade sauce,” Delamain suggests. Tilak, meanwhile, would think about charring carrots or crisping potatoes to toss with a punchy kebab masala and finish with a zippy lime and chilli dressing: “The intense heat cooks everything quickly and locks in the most amazing flavour.” His preferred dish, however, would be biryani: “Yes, even that works in a pizza oven: layer marinated chicken in the base of a pot, top it with partially cooked rice, then finish with a little cream, butter, fresh mint and coriander.” Seal with a lid and cook “ondum[AKA low and slow].”And if you fancy something sweet, flaky pastry is “at its best with the dry heat of a pizza oven,” says Tomas Topolar, head chef atOxmoor Farmin the Chiltern Hills, who adds that pizza oven galettes are easier than, well, pie: “The sweetest blackberries are those that come off easily; they almost fall into your fingers. You then only need to add lemon juice, a dusting of flour and sprinkle of sugar to make a beautiful filling.” And remember that residual heat is also your friend, Jones says: “Slice stone fruit [peaches, plums or nectarines, say], put them in a cast-iron pan, drizzle with honey and add fresh thyme.” After about 20 minutes in the oven “they’ll be lovely and sticky”. Just add yoghurt and chopped nuts for happy days.Got a culinary dilemma? Emailfeast@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsChefsKitchen aideFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As night fell, they had no idea what was comingByJonah GoodmanTue 5 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 10.27 EDTShareIn the wake of a natural disaster, certain metrics are used to categorise the event: the buildings destroyed; the cost of repair to the nearest million; a single number for the loss of human life. Yet these figures obscure the truth of such events. They make the outcome seem fixed, somehow proportionate. But disasters are chaotic. Their extreme violence magnifies the consequences of every decision: to stay or to move; to run or to hide. Things could have turned out another way. And how would we talk about them then?In Locarno,Switzerland, on the northern shore of Lake Maggiore, lies the mouth of the Maggia river. Follow it north-west and it winds past sandy, tree-shaded beaches, through rocky gorges and into a broad, glacial valley where, for much of the year, long waterfalls drop down forested mountainsides. Just over 20 kilometres upstream, at the foot of the Pizzo di Brünesc mountain, the river splits in two. This is the upper Maggia valley. To the west runs Val Bavona, with its historic villages of stone-roofed houses. To the east, equally steep and green, is Val Lavizzara. And in the upper reaches of Val Lavizzara, at an altitude of 1,000 metres, is Campo Draione.Campo Draione might be the most beautiful football pitch on Earth – or, at least, in Switzerland. It fills a thin shelf of land above a mountain stream, curtained from the road by forest and surrounded on all sides by peaks blanketed with pines. It was laid in the 1950s, on rubble from nearby hydroelectric projects, and since 1970, for one weekend every year, it hosts one of the most popular events in the Maggia valley: a two-day, eight-a-side football tournament of 18 teams from across the canton of Ticino.Most years, the tournament is on the first weekend in July, but in 2024, it was brought forward, to avoid clashing with a fireworks event in Locarno. So it was on 29 June, a warm Saturday morning, that hundreds of people gathered on and around Campo Draione. There was a family atmosphere; those who weren’t competing were eating ice-cream, buying drinks in a marquee, or swimming in the stream at Piano di Peccia, a village 10 minutes’ walk away, across a narrow car bridge over a deep, green gully.The highlight would take place that evening: a party under the stars with an outdoor stage and lighting rig, three bands and a DJ, stretching into the early hours, when revellers would drift off to tents set up along the edges of the pitch or in farmland nearby.But that morning, the lead organiser of the event, Daniele Rotanzi, kept looking at his phone. The app for MeteoSwiss, the federal weather office, was forecasting a level 3 storm warning – a “significant hazard” – for the canton. “There was certain to be rain,” remembers Rotanzi, an athletic man who looks younger than his 40 years. He consulted the tournament’s 10-person organising committee – all volunteers – and they decided to build a makeshift stage inside the marquee: a 50cm-high wooden platform. Less glamorous, but sensible, they felt, given the situation.The SwissMeteo office for the southern Alps sits on a steep hillside north of the centre of Locarno. From the windows of its forecasting room, the curve of the Maggia delta spreads out below: a giant fan of land pushed some 2.5km into the lake. Few rivers inEuropeare as sensitive to rainfall as the Maggia, or swell as fast. Months earlier, in September 2023, the waters had surged 17-fold in a matter of hours; it was the kind of deluge the landscape took in its stride.But at lunchtime on that last Saturday in June, the meteorologists were worried. One week earlier, a thunderstorm in their territory had triggered a debris flow that devastated the hamlet of Sorte, Graubünden. Two people were killed; one was still missing. Sorte was uninhabitable. Now, they saw low pressure moving from France to southern Germany, just as hot air pushed northwards fromItaly. In spring 2024, the surface temperature of the Mediterranean had been six degrees above its 30-year average, and in recent days, it had set new records for June. When those currents of hot, wet air collided with the massive concave barrier of the Alps, they would either be deflected or converge and climb, creating the conditions for another major storm.At 13.30, the meteorologists held a video call with police, the fire brigade, the civil protection agency, the transport network and the cantonal experts on hydrology and geology. For the first time in the Ticino canton, they were raising the thunderstorm threat to its highest level: a “severe” hazard, level 4, with risks including flash floods, tree-toppling winds, landslides, giant hailstones and lightning. Radar maps showed heavy rain in the alpine valleys of upper Ticino, and violent thunderstorms in central and southern parts of the canton: Locarno, Bellinzona, Lugano.Warnings went out on local television, radio, social media and the widely used MeteoSwiss app. Police and fire services briefed local command posts. River authorities, forestry districts and municipalities with landslide risks were alerted. But the information was frustratingly imprecise: no one knew where the rain would land. The internal MeteoSwiss weather model was predicting extreme rain over the upper Maggia valley. Yet neither the briefing nor the public warnings specified the risk of flash flooding in the valley: instead, they were general for the whole of Ticino.Thunderstorms are among the most unpredictable phenomena in meteorology, and this was thunderstorm rain. If their model predicts the epicentre of a thunderstorm to within 30km even one time in 10, the MeteoSwiss team are impressed. That is, if it occurs at all. Most MeteoSwiss warnings are based on a 70% chance of the event, but for thunderstorms, that likelihood is almost halved to 40%. As late as Saturday afternoon, the likelihood was that there would be no storm, anywhere in the canton.Daniele Rotanzi is from Piano di Peccia, the village near Campo Draione. About half the people on the pitch were also from the Maggia valley, including Rotanzi’s best friend, Loris Foresti. Foresti was born further down Val Lavizzara, in Prato-Sornico, and the men had known each other since they were four years old. Summers were spent swimming by Piano di Peccia, or at Grotto Pozzasc, a tavern owned by Foresti’s parents beside a shady, turquoise rock pool. Winters revolved around the ice rink at Prato-Sornico. Every year since they were teenagers, the two had taken part in its annual ice hockey tournament.View image in fullscreenResidents from Piano di Peccia, in the Maggia valley, return home for the first time after storms, 3 July 2024.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockForesti is a meteorologist, developing software for MeteoSwiss that, among other things, monitors thunderstorms. So when Rotanzi saw that the alert had been raised, he went to his friend for advice. “It was level 4,” says Foresti, “but you don’t know where it is going to hit. I was like – OK, could we do the concert outside after it stops?”There was a strange yellow tint to the partly clouded sky, Saharan dust in the upper atmosphere. On the ground, the air felt close and humid. As the afternoon wore on there were brief showers, but not enough to stop play. And at 6pm, when the last match finished, everyone rushed to the long marquee. The real football was about to begin. The Swiss national team were playing the reigning champions, Italy, in the first knockout stage of the European Championship. The game was projected on to a white sheet, and ribs from the grill were served at trestle tables. Between 300 and 400 people crammed into the tent, their cheers drowning out the growing sound of rain on the plastic roof. By the final whistle, at 8pm, Switzerland had won 2-0 – a historic upset – and it was raining hard, but not enough to dampen the celebrations. There was a rush to the bar. At 9pm, the first band of the night, a spoof “farm metal” outfit, started its set. Outside, a thunderstorm had begun.Much about thunderstorms is unknown. But the biggest puzzle is predicting when and how they will occur, a problem tied to one of the great mysteries of physics: turbulent motion.Light a candle and blow it out. The smoke will rise evenly at first, then start to tumble upwards. That tumbling is turbulence, and in our current understanding of the universe, there is no way to predict the shape it will take. Unlike other phenomena on the frontiers of human knowledge, such as black holes, turbulent motion is something you encounter every day: in the movement of flames in a fire, the path of a fragrance through a room, the rhythm of waves on the shore. When smooth or “laminar” flow breaks up into turbulence, large eddies create ever smaller eddies, with each impacting the movement of the others, becoming exponentially more complex with every passing moment.Turbulent dynamics affect all weather – they are why meteorologists cannot forecast more than 14 days ahead – but thunderstorms especially are formed and governed by turbulent currents. With global heating, the most violent phenomenon in weather may be becoming more violent, and it remains defiantly unpredictable.As midnight approached on Campo Draione, torrential rain had been falling for almost three hours. Inside the marquee, a folk band was playing on the improvised stage. Foresti stood with his back to them, looking out at the downpour, at the mountains lit by a strobe of constant lightning, flickering several times a second.“I love thunderstorms,” Foresti said. “I get excited about them. I took pictures.” As a meteorologist, he knew that this was not just one storm, but a series generated by a stationary front above him, drawing warm, moist air into it “like a thunderstorm machine”.Suddenly, he felt uneasy. The front should have moved. It should be over. “It has to stop now,” Foresti remembers thinking. But the rain kept pouring down. He began to think about the valley, about the people running his parents’ tavern down by the river. He and the hundreds of people around him were in terrible danger. As the band played behind him, Foresti began to shake with fear.When storms come in a series, there are usually lulls between them. But that night, they ran back to back, relentless in their intensity, focused on a strip of land roughly 20km by nine, stretched along the serpentine ridge of peaks, 2,500 metres high, separating the two valleys of the upper Maggia. Outside this area, the rainfall dropped off sharply; in Locarno, almost no rain fell. But by midnight, more than 50mm of rain per hour – 50 litres per square metre – was falling on the ridge. And it landed on snow.Ticino’s climate is hot, almost Mediterranean, and typically any snow would have melted by the end of May. But in 2024, it had snowed so heavily at the end of April that some still lay on the peaks, one month into a hot summer. Snowmelt saturated the ridge, and the rain ran across wet ground. By the time it reached the treeline, it was still 1,000 metres above the villages in the valleys, but the deluge, thick with grit, already had the force to move rocks and snap trees.“A phenomenon as turbulent as a debris flow, combining water with sediment, debris and trees, is impossible to simulate,” says Andrea Salvetti, the canton hydrologist. The water moves, but so does everything it touches: a large rock can change its course; a pile of debris can build a dam. “You can’t know where the water will go.”At quarter past midnight, a woman rushed into the marquee. She had just arrived by car to take her daughter home, and she was terrified. “She said that it was crazy,” says Foresti. “That there were stones jumping on to the bridge, that there were stones below the bridge and they were moving.”“Not everyone wanted to believe it,” remembers Foresti. “Some youngsters said she was talking shit, and she got angry.” But Foresti recognised her description of a debris flow, where “stones float on the mud and the water”. He saw, too, the need to prevent panic. “I was trying to play calm, but I was not calm.”The third band of the night were preparing to start their set, and Rotanzi checked in with the DJ who was driving up to close the party. “What time will you arrive?” wrote Rotanzi at 12.20am. The DJ replied one minute later: “Ciao, I’ll be there in 10 minutes! The roads are horrible. It’s taken me a while.” Rotanzi responded with two thumbs up. Then all the lights went out.Smartphone torches flicked on; rain thundered on the roof. About 200 people stood in the darkness. Someone said they had a generator in a nearby village, and a group went out to pick it up. Then Rotanzi’s phone buzzed. It was the DJ. “The river is overflowing,” he wrote. “I can’t get past.” He sent a photo of water lit by his headlights, pouring across a road. Rotanzi knew the spot; there was no river there. “Turn back,” he wrote, and he called the police.The police said squad cars were on their way, and Rotanzi called the fire chief. “He told me, ‘Keep everyone in the tent.’” There had been flooding and landslides not far away. The group looking for a generator had already left, but came to a stop 50 metres from the bridge. Water was coming over the top of the crossing. They turned back.Inside the marquee, Rotanzi jumped on to a table to address the crowd. There was no way to leave: the road was blocked. Everyone had to stay in the tent. “You could sense that people knew something important was happening,” recalled Rotanzi. “Everyone listened in silence.”Along the ridge between the valleys, the downpour had entered its fourth hour. That night, storm clouds dropped 30bn litres of water. Pure, that water had a weight of 30m tonnes; combined with debris, its mass was inestimable. It tore down trees, drove earth out from under stone and set rocks sliding. The mountains were moving.At a point almost 1,300 metres above sea level, they stopped. A colossal block of stone, packed around with debris, closed off the end of a steep channel. Even after heavy rain, water in the channel had a maximum depth of three metres. Dammed by the rock, the water rose over 30 metres high.Fontana is a historic village of moss-clad stone buildings, built on green terraces in Val Bavona – the opposite side of the ridge from Campo Draione. When the bottleneck burst, Fontana was hit by a blast of water, debris and 300,000 cubic metres of rock. The surge broke walls and shredded cars like they were tissue paper. In its midst, lit by lightning, taller than the houses around it, the colossal 2,000-ton block that had dammed the channel travelled upright on a bed of moving rock, gliding 450 metres from one end of the village to the other. The settlement was sliced in two, buried under a fan of rubble 500 metres long, 500 metres wide and as much as 13 metres deep.Five people lost their lives. Three German holidaymakers had left their house at the top of the village when the bottleneck burst. They were killed in the open; the house survived the storm. At the lower end of the village, a local couple appear to have been sheltering in their home. The building was entirely destroyed.On Campo Draione, the atmosphere had calmed. The tent was unheated, and people huddled together to keep warm under tarpaulins, foil blankets and plastic tablecloths. A lone, battery-powered lamp dangled from the ceiling. Through the gloom, Rotanzi saw a man approaching. It was the stage technician. He seemed agitated. There was something Rotanzi needed to see.Rotanzi stepped out into the rain. Barely five metres from the end of the marquee, where the forest had stood, there was a void. The corner of the outdoor stage jutted into empty space. The wheels of a parked van hung over thin air. He heard the roar of the river, 30 metres below. By his feet, Rotanzi saw the rubble the pitch was built on, exposed by the landslide. In the flashing lightning, it looked like little more than gravel.View image in fullscreen‘Barely five metres from the end of the marquee, where the forest had stood, there was a void.’Photograph: SwisstopoRotanzi was stunned. The bridge to the village was blocked. Uphill, through dense, rocky forest, there was a house just 50 metres away. But 200 people would never fit in the house, even if they reached it. Was anywhere safe? The slope above the pitch was steep and high. Who knew what could fall? In the tent behind him, shivering in their wet summer clothes, the partygoers were unaware of the collapse. And Rotanzi realised that he had to make a decision: he could tell them what had happened and risk a panic, or stay silent and risk the entire tent, with hundreds of lives, being pulled into the deluge.In his daily life, Rotanzi is an actuary at an insurance company, used to calculating risk under much calmer conditions. Nothing prepared him for the decisions he had to make that night. He returned to the marquee, found two friends on the organising committee, and brought them out to see. “Nothing was sure that night,” said Rotanzi. “But my main thought was: we can’t allow panic to break out.” Half of the partygoers were not from the area; people had been drinking. If they left the shelter of the tent, hypothermia would set in fast. Rotanzi explained his thinking, and the friends agreed. They would station a security guard at the outside corner of the tent. If he saw any further movement, they would evacuate. But until then, apart from this small group, the landslide should be kept a secret.Inside the marquee, Foresti sensed that something strange was happening. He could hear the river, “and that’s not a place where you typically hear the river, because of the forest”. He had seen Rotanzi and the two friends leave the tent together. He waited a while, then followed.“At the end of the marquee, the forest had gone,” said Foresti. He peered into the darkness with the torch on his smartphone, but its light could not penetrate the rain. He tried to take a picture, but nothing came out. “Then, with the lightning, I saw the river for just one second. When there is a flood the water is turbulent – it’s like a washing machine – but this was much higher and laminar. And it was difficult for my mind to accept. It did not make sense. It was a kind of river that I’d never seen before.”Foresti went to Rotanzi, who asked him to keep quiet. Foresti understood, but shouldn’t they move people away from that end of the marquee? The downpour had gone on for almost six hours. The whole tent could go down. Rotanzi approached people resting at the far end of the marquee, unaware they were next to a precipice, and asked if they might move away from the side. “But without telling them why, I wasn’t very convincing,” he said. “Some people just stayed.”Giorgia Mattei was in the marquee. On the other side of the impassable bridge, in Piano di Peccia, her mother, younger sister and her younger sister’s children were in the house where all three generations lived together. She looked at a picture on the family WhatsApp group of the front door of the house under water. Her younger sister wrote that she was afraid. She wrote that rocks and trees were coming down from the mountain. She and Giorgia’s mother were staying high up; the children were still sleeping. Her mother wrote that the henhouse had been washed away.At 2.30am, Giorgia wrote on the family WhatsApp that they were all alive on Campo Draione; that they were OK. Her younger sister replied that cars were pressing against the side of the house. Her mother wrote that they were all staying together. Giorgia told her mother to stay high up, to stay with her sister.On the other side of the Alps, in the Jura, Giorgia’s father woke up and read the messages on his phone. He wrote on the group chat that he was trying to call and couldn’t get through. But no one read his message. No one could. The family’s phones had all gone dead.The Visletto Bridge over the Maggia had broken in two. The 80-metre stone crossing was the sole transport link to the upper valleys and carried crucial pipes and cables. When it snapped, the upper Maggia valleys were cut off: without telephone signal, internet, running water or electricity.The rain had stopped. There was nothing to do but wait for dawn.In the blue-grey first light, red-and-white mountain rescue helicopters poured up the valleys. At 5am, two hours after the bridge collapsed, the canton chief of police, Commander Matteo Cocchi, had declared a state of emergency. Led by Captain Antonio Ciocco, the police had entered Locarno’s disaster coordination bunker and commandeered a school in Aurigeno to use its football pitch as a helicopter pad. Ciocco demanded assistance from all local agencies – fire, forestry, mountain rescue – and the army.View image in fullscreenDestroyed houses in Fontana, 04 July 2024.Photograph: Michael Buholzer/EPAAs the helicopters sent back the first aerial images from the disaster zone, the gravity of the situation sank in. There were more than 50 debris flows. Old watercourses had been blasted open. Roads were destroyed. Fontana was almost unrecognisable – its green terraces replaced by a grey lake of rock. “The immediate question was, ‘What is underneath the stone?’” says Ciocco. “Are there injured people? If you can see them, you know they need to be rescued. But what you can’t see, you can only imagine.”Campo Draione appeared on a screen in the command centre. Where the bridge to the village had been, a swath of stone 100 metres wide and four times as long ran from the forest to the river – a quarter of a million tonnes of rock. The landslide by the river was 20 metres wide. The marquee was still there.Up on the pitch, partygoers were emerging into a disordered world. Groups of people stood by the void, staring in disbelief at turf hanging over empty space. Through the hole in the forest they saw Piano di Peccia, half-buried in rubble. A river three times wider than usual coursed through the broken village.When the phones had stopped working, someone had fetched an emergency two-way radio he kept in his car. With its satellite function, they called mountain rescue, who told them to stay where they were. Sitting in cars to warm up, they tried to get news from the radio. FM was down, but DAB worked. “At 6am, we heard someone say that there were 200 people in Campo Draione, and they’re all safe,” remembered Rotanzi. “That was a big relief for many people.”Shortly afterwards, a helicopter landed. Mountain rescue assessed the situation, then left: there were 40 children stranded at a summer camp in Mogno, and they took precedence. The catering team made breakfast. “It wasn’t certain that we could be evacuated that day,” says Rotanzi. “So from 6am, every two hours we told people what we knew.” They had catering supplies, vehicles for shelter and camping equipment, but no way to communicate with family and friends. The partygoers did not know it, but their frantic parents had overwhelmed the police phone line: 500 calls were taken, but 6,000 could not get through. It took until 10am for the police to set up a specialised number.Giorgia Mattei was freezing. She tried to warm up in a friend’s VW camper van, wrapped her feet in aluminium foil, and switched her sodden pumps for a dry pair of army boots, four sizes too large. Her mother, her sister and her sister’s children were just hundreds of metrers away. She did not know if they were alive.At aroundabout 8am, she heard that someone was trying to build a bridge to the village: a farmer who had hailed a helicopter with a laser pen, and come across the landslide to safeguard his cows. Giorgia went to find him, and helped him fell a tree across the torrent. Feet sliding in the borrowed boots, she began to walk across the trunk. “My legs were shaking,” says Giorgia. “I was terrified of falling.”A debris flow from the forest had hit the family home. Giorgia saw the henhouse, 50 metres from its usual spot. The hens were alive. Rubble blocked the house’s front door, and the ground floor was filled with mud. But her mother and younger sister and the children were safe.They had no way of contacting her father. He had driven five hours through the night, believing that his wife, his children and his grandchildren had all been killed. He had attempted, unsuccessfully, to get a lift in a helicopter. He argued with police who tried to stop him. He hitched lifts, and climbed debris flows, going deeper into the disaster zone, as others fled. At 17.30, he reached his broken home, and found his family safe.On Campo Draione, the army had arrived. Evacuees were boarding a Super Puma helicopter, one group of 15 at a time, abandoning tents, instruments, cars. “It is an image that will never leave my mind,” says Rotanzi. “The football pitch is a place for joy, and the contrast with this huge, military helicopter was so big … It was a moment that was great and terrible at the same time.”View image in fullscreenA drone photo of debris after the flooding and landslides in Fontana, Val Bavona, in the Maggia valley, 8 August 2024.Photograph: Pablo Gianinazzi/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockRotanzi was on the penultimate helicopter; an eight-minute flight to the school at Aurigeno. From the window, he gazed down at the ravaged landscape, stunned by the scale of destruction. “All night, I had been telling myself, ‘Shit – these people are here because we organised this,’” he says. He felt a wave of relief. Then his phone buzzed. Hundreds of messages. Missed calls. “That’s when I realised what had happened,” says Rotanzi. “We were going back to real life.” The helicopter landed. And he began to cry.No one knows how many people were in the upper Maggia valley that night. The registered population of 1,000 doubles in summer and by the end of Sunday, more than 500 people were missing. It took three full days to go through the list. “There were hundreds,” says Captain Ciocco. “Then 50, then 10. Until, at the end: one person was missing.”The missing person had been on Campo Draione. A 22-year-old local man, he may have left the party before midnight to rest in his car, parked near the bridge. Seven people were confirmed to have died in the disaster: five in Fontana, and two in Prato-Sornico. But though more than 2,200 people participated in the search for the missing man, neither he nor his car have been found.Foresti questions himself: “Did I under-react? There was another level 4 warning some weeks later. There was some hail and that was it.” Given the same information again, he reckons he would not act differently.In public and private, Rotanzi was challenged about his decision not to cancel. “The warning was given for that night,” says Rotanzi. “If we had cancelled at 6pm, the teams would have gone to their tents, in places that were later flooded and hit by rocks. Things could have been even worse.”Should the police have intervened? “We cannot order an evacuation without more specific information from MeteoSwiss,” said Commander Cocchi. But MeteoSwiss cannot provide that specificity – without a scientific breakthrough on turbulent flow, it may never be able to. For all their resources and assiduous monitoring, the Swiss authorities were forced to come to a frightening conclusion: the whole situation could be repeated.There is a visual logic to the mountains; the way trees grow towards the light, the paths of water, eroded over geological timescales. Much of that has been upended. For months, machines worked to clear paths through a moonscape of fallen rock, struggling to undo a few hours of rain. But it will take decades for life to return to the rock, with lichens, then moss, then earth. People who have lived here all their lives – whose grandparents lived here, who knew it as children – are learning the new grammar of a shattered landscape.“I would go fishing behind my parents’ tavern,” says Foresti. “I knew every water pool. It was all a forest, and the river had a completely different path. Now it is filled with stones. Where there was a trail, now there is no trail. Where there was forest and cows would graze, now I can see a mountain. The forest is gone.”The June 2024 flash flood was among the most violent in the region for 200 years. Few expect to wait long until the next. “Such rain events look like they are becoming more frequent,” says Luca Nisi, deputy head of Locarno’s SwissMeteo team.The sound of icebergs melting: my journey into the AntarcticRead moreAnd there are other threats. Almost one year after the Maggia valley storm,the Swiss village of Blatten was obliterated,buried by rock falling on to a glacier, which then collapsed. Melting permafrost appears to have triggered the event, and for the last 10 years, Switzerland’s mean temperatures have been 2.9C above their preindustrial average. Such dangers are not limited to the Alps: last week, in the Italian Dolomites,hundreds were evacuatedto escape rockfalls caused by melting permafrost.As Switzerland debates the future of its mountain communities, a retreat from the landscape has a simple appeal. But the climate crisis is a complex problem. By Campo Draione, a mudslide emerged from the forest where there was no natural drainage channel. At its origin stood a cluster of dead trees, killed by a parasitic bark beetle that has thrived in the hotter, drier summers of recent years. Their roots could not hold the ground.Who will monitor the consequences of climate change? The inhabitants of the mountains can be caught off guard, but they have an unteachable understanding of their territory, and the small, consequential ways in which it is changing. Rather than abandon the landscape, it may be time to engage with it more than ever.The football tournament went ahead in 2025. Grotto Pozzasc, the bar owned by Foresti’ parents, is open. The communities are recovering, but they are wounded.“I don’t feel safe when there are thunderstorms,” says Giorgia. “Thunder makes me feel afraid.” That fear may feel new, but it is not unnatural. It is how, until recently, all humans experienced the weather. Not as an inconvenience on an app – predicted, contained – but as a force of nature. For a brief moment in history, we felt that the weather could be tamed. When, all that time, we were making it more wild.This is an edited version of an article first published inDas Magazin.Jonah Goodman is a freelance journalist based in Paris.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readExtreme weatherItalySwitzerlandClimate crisisFloodingEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a tale of very capitalist timesTue 5 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 03.51 EDTShareBonnie Blue has sex with men on camera for money. Lots of men one after the other, to be precise, for lots and lots of money: the commercial niche she invented to distinguish herself from countless other amateur porn stars jostling desperately for attention on OnlyFans was inviting “barely legal” ordinary teenage boys (which in porn means 18-plus) to have sex with her on film, and flogging the results to paying subscribers for a fortune. Unusually, her model involves a woman making millions out of men generating content for free, which makes it slightly harder than usual to work out exactly who is exploiting whom if she turns up (as she did in Nottingham) at a university freshers’ week with a sign saying “bonk me and let me film it”.But debating whether getting rich this way makes Bonnie personally “empowered” seems tired and pointless. It was with this old pseudo-feminist chestnut that Channel 4 justified last week’sratings-chasing documentaryon her attempt to sleep with 1,000 men in 12 hours, a film that finally brought her into the cultural mainstream. There’s more to this story than sex, gender politics or Bonnie herself, and whatever is driving her (which she swears isn’t past trauma, “daddy issues” over a biological father she never knew, or anything else you’re thinking: though she does say maybe her brain works differently from other people’s, given her curious ability to switch off her emotions). It’s at heart a story about money, the merging of the oldest trade in the world with a newer attention economy inexorably geared towards rewarding extremes, and what that does to the society that unwittingly produced it.As her now-estranged husband explained admiringly to camera, though OnlyFans performers often invite a man to imagine he’s doing whatever he wants to them, that’s an illusion: really they’re out of reach. But Bonnie (real name Tia Billinger) isn’t. She actively encourages her fans to come and do it to her for real. She is the parasocial relationship – that strange confusion created when you think you know someone because you’ve seen so much of their life unfold on your phone screen, though in reality they’re a stranger – taken to its fantasy conclusion: a stalker’s dream made flesh. Like what you see? Then just reach through the screen and grab it.Bonnie/Tia comes across essentially as a female Andrew Tate, telling teenage or otherwise vulnerable audiences that they have a right to sex – in one video urging men not to feel guilty about taking part in her stunts, she says it’s only what they were “owed”, the language of the incel forum – and that it’s hot to beslapped around or degraded; but, unlike Tate, with the apparent authority of actually being a woman herself. Channel 4 filmed the men queueing up to join her 1,000-men stunt mostly as a line of mute, anonymous shuffling feet. But we already know that watching near-ubiquitous porn online has changed the way younger generations have sex. What does being invited into the picture do? No wonder Ofcom is taking an interest, while the children’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, warns against TV normalising things that – as she put it–teenagers find “frightening, confusing and damaging to their relationships”.Ironically, the biggest short-term beneficiary of such a storm may be Bonnie/Tia herself, already a dab hand at posting rage-bait videos expertly calibrated to provoke women who already can’t stand her (and are willing to explain why at length to their own followers on their own social media channels). Being hated is great for business, she explains chirpily: the more women publicly denounce her, the more their sons and husbands will Google her. Her real skill is in monetising both lustandrage, crossing the internet’s two most powerful streams to capture its most lucrative currency: attention.“She’s a marketing genius,” her female publicist tellsChannel 4, laughing as the team discuss how best to commercially exploit footage of an appalled mother trying to retrieve her son from one of Bonnie/Tia’s filmed orgies. OnlyFans performers can’t advertise as a normal business would, so they promote themselves by seeding clips across social media, ideally of them doing something wild enough to go viral: since people get bored easily, the pressure is always on to keep getting wilder and wilder, pushing way past whatever you thought were your limits.That has long been the trajectory of porn stars’ careers, of course. But it’s also recognisably now true of so much contemporary culture, from fully clothed influencers to reality TV shows forced to introduce ever more cruel plot twists to stop the formula getting stale (this year’s Love Island has noticeably morphed from dating show into a kind of brutal sexual Hunger Games), and arguably even broadcasters such as Channel 4 fighting desperately for audience share in a world of almost infinite competition for eyeballs. When I finish watching 1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Story on catchup, the channel’s algorithm perkily suggests an episode ofSex Actually with Alice Levine. Like the sexy stuff? Want more? Please don’t leave me for YouTube!Parents, don’t panic – healthy screen time for children is possible, if you follow these few simple tips | Kaitlyn RegehrRead moreAs with Tate, if Bonnie was somehow shut down there would be another one along soon enough. She’s a feature, not a bug, the inevitable product of an economy relentlessly geared to giving an audience what it most reliably pays for – to feel angry or horny, or both at once – and then endlessly pushing its luck. But society does still have some limits to impose on what is in the end just another business model.Her current nemesis is Visa, which processes OnlyFans payments and which she says declined to be associated with her 1,000-man marathon, leading to her being banned from uploading it and cashing in. (Legislators have long regarded mainstream financial services companies on whom porn sites rely to rake in their profits as the crack in their armour, more susceptible to public opinion and regulatory pressure.) Meanwhile, a newtaskforce on pornographyheaded by the Tory peer Gabby Bertin, who formerly worked for David Cameron in Downing Street, is arguing for a ban on content likely to encourage child sexual abuse – which Bertin argues could encompass “barely legal” material or (as Bonnie has alsoexperimented with doing, as her options narrowed) casting grown porn actors as schoolgirls.Like Labour’s battle against Page 3 girls in the 1990s, which in retrospect seems an astonishingly innocent era, if ministers want to pick this fight with porn it will be brutal. But doing nothing might, in the end, be more so.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The government has signalled its support for colossal expansions, whose extra flights would bust its carbon pledges. The excuse is that supertechnology will magic away the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere, though it must know that clean, green flying is still futurology. Here’s the pity of it: until now this government has rightly boasted of its green credentials, making massive investments in sustainable energy and retro-insulating cold homes. Expanding air travel is not on any green agenda.Heathrow has just submitted proposals fora £50bn third runway, as approved by Labour in 2009 and the Tories whovoted it through parliament in 2018. Covid applied the brakes but now Heathrow is back with gold-plated, “shovel-ready” plans. Its owners, including Qatar, Singapore and Saudi Arabia, expect the planning bill to prevent newts or judicial reviews blocking the runway. Their pitch to an investment-hungry government is that expanding Europe’s busiest airport would create 100,000 new jobs, propelling growth with 750 extra daily flights.Flying gets a green light from the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander: she agreed todouble the sizeof Luton airport, favoursGatwick’s second runwayfor 100,000 more flights and gives Stansted’s expansion a fair wind. These allowa 70% increasein flights above 2018 levels, andcancel out all the carbon savingsfrom the government’s clean power plan.Rachel Reeves promised to be “Britain’s first green chancellor”, but her plans live or die on growth, so billions in private investment is hard to resist. But beyond construction, the growth-potential claims for extra flights look highly dubious. The promised global “connectivity” imagines business people zipping into Britain with briefcases full of contracts. But that’s not who these extra flyers will be. Most will be frequent flyers flying more frequently, not for business but for leisure, according to theNew Economics Foundationand Possible, the climate campaign. National Travel and Civil Aviation Authority passenger surveys show only one in 14 UK passengers are business travellers. The pandemic showed that meeting online saves money and time; business travel has already peaked. Would extra flights bring in tourist income? No, 70% of flights are British tourists off abroad to spend vastly more than foreigners spend here.Of extra flights in 20 years, 83% were taken by already frequent flyers, mostly for leisure. Growth will not be from more families taking an annual holiday: half the population doesn’t fly in any year, while just 15% consume 70% of flights. Nearly a third are “ultra-frequent flyers” taking six or more journeys a year. Instead of these heaviest users paying more for their pollution, airlines reward frequent flyers. The Flying Fair report from the New Economics Foundation suggests imposing a high levy on those flying six or more times a year, not added to ticket prices but raised in tax returns. That makes the cost of their excessive air travel highly visible, and could raise £6bn a year, while cutting aviation CO2 by 28%.View image in fullscreenPassengers wait for train services at Euston station as Storm Floris disrupts travel across the UK, 4 August 2025.Newly nationalised trains would gain from disincentivising flight. But UK prices are a bizarre deterrent. I’m planning to go to Edinburgh next week – a train journey I love. Checking prices, I found a £29.99 flight each way, while LNER costs £181.69 return. France has banned domestic flights where trains can do the journey in less than two and a half hours and so should we: start by banning airlines charging less than rail. Switch the39m domestic journeysbeing made annually by plane to train.The good news is theextra potential capacityin the Channel tunnel, which could be realised with a little investment. Twelve trains an hour run each way, but the tunnel could run 2.5 times more, and prices would fall. That’s where investment should go, instead of to airports, as new European routes open up. Yes, it takes longer. It means adding train time to the concept of a holiday. But if it were cheaper, what luxury it would be compared with the hell of holiday airports and flights that don’t land you in city centres.Climate damage is the real cost of avoidable flying.The chancellor says: “Expansion must be delivered in line with UK’s legal, environmental and climate obligations.” But the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government’s statutory adviser, warns that airport expansionwould breach UK carbon budgetsfor net zero emissions by 2050. The aviation industry and government claim that wonder technology will deliver carbon-free flying with electric planes, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and carbon capture. None is anywhere near available, says the CCC, which expects 17% SAFs by 2040. It advises no extra flying before 2030, and only 2% more by 2035, to allow time for new technology to be developed. Let’s hope clean flight arrives soon, but it’s not here yet: currently, suppliers must only guarantee that SAFs comprises 2% of the total. Here’s the honesty test for those claiming carbon-neutral flight is imminent: agree to no extra flying until it arrives.What will expanding Heathrow do to UK’s net zero plans?Read moreThe government’s mood music is all pro-flying, not urging climate-conscious travel. To change habits and attitudes, it should start by banning frequent flyer bonuses. Why allow private jets? Seat for seat they are 30 times more polluting, paying less tax as a proportion of ticket price, as was exposed by Possible’sJetting away with itreport.The government’s airport policy will reveal its seriousness on the climate crisis. Politically, it shows whetherLabouris sufficiently alarmed by serious threats from the left, from Greens, Liberal Democrats and Jeremy Corbyn revivalists pledged to invest in trains, not airports. But refusing airport expansion allows Tories and Faragistes to add those lost foreign billions to their dishonest tally of net zero costs.A YouGov poll found that 61% of people regard airport expansion asthe wrong priority, alongside mayors Andy Burnham and Sadiq Khan. But the Treasury’s dilemma is obvious: climate or cash? Its answer should also be clear: just call a moratorium until green flying arrives.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsAirline industryOpinionHeathrow airportHeathrow third runwayGatwick airportStansted airportAir transportLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Some are about vaginas; some are about the genocide inGaza. Was this person thanking me for drawing attention to thedesperate plightof people on eBay who are prepared to pay five times the original sales price for Gwyneth Paltrow’s delisted This Smells Like My Vagina candle? Or were they referencing Gaza?I suspected the latter, but there was no way of immediately knowing – which often feels par for the course when it comes to the conversation aroundGaza. The Trump administration has cracked down on pro-Palestinian speech to such a draconian degree that even within a private text message, some people are too terrified about jeopardising their career or immigration status to speak up. Many lawmakers and parts of the media seem to have lost the ability to communicate in plain English when it comes to Palestine. I have seen long articles handwringing about the desperatelycomplicatedsituation of starving kids which don’t mention the word “Israel” once. I have lost count of the number of articles talking about “starvation stalking Gaza” that circle endlessly around exactly how this starvation has come about.The climate of fear around Palestine is so pervasive, even private conversations feel riskyGaza is almost completely destroyed. There is now agrowing consensusthat a genocide is under way, and since a plan for the mass displacement of Palestinians to make space for a “Gaza riviera” was discussed in the Knesset, more people are beginning to speak up. Nevertheless, Gaza-related atrocity denial is so widespread in the US, and the climate of fear around speaking about Palestine so pervasive, that an influential person voicing an unequivocal criticism of Israel’s conduct will still make the news.See, for example, John Oliver. The Last Week Tonight host madeheadlinesthis week after he opened his most recent show with a clear-eyed analysis of the human-made famine in Gaza. “Look, ‘Gaza is starving’ is a sentence that’s objectively true, but it’s also slightly misleading because it’s too passive,” Oliver said. “Gaza is being starved by Israel.”I’m glad to see Oliver spelling this out. But it is enraging that it is a late-night host speaking with clarity rather than editorial boards, cable news anchors or politicians – many of whom seem to treat mass starvation as an unfortunate and unintentional consequence of war rather than a deliberate act. One CBSvideo from last December, for example, is headlined: “Hunger spreads virtually everywhere in Gaza amid Israel-Hamas war.” As the Al Jazeera Journalism Review argues, many headlines in major US outlets have similarlydescribed the situationas a “food crisis” rather than an intentional blockade.Meanwhile, the rightwing Free Press – which CBS is reportedly mulling buying for up to $250m partly because of its “pro-Israel stance”,according to the FT– described media reporting around starvation in Gaza as part of “a highly effective campaign of information warfare” against Israel perpetrated by Hamas. And while experts have beenwarningabout famine risks in Gaza sinceDecember 2023, an analysis of US media coverage by thewatchdog Fairshows most outlets barely covered the situation until it became undeniably grim. “The conditions of famine have been out in the open for well over a year, and yet it was considered barely newsworthy in US news media,” it says.The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in GazaRead moreOliver isn’t the only late-night host speaking up. Indeed, from the shenanigans of the Trump administration to the starvation of Gaza, late-night hosts (and children’s entertainerMs Rachel) seem to have become the moral voice of the US. The Daily Show’sJon Stewarthas also been outspoken about Gaza. “I have a moral clarity about what I’m seeing,”said Stewart, who is Jewish, in an episode last weekwhere he was speaking to the Jewish Currents editor-at-large, Peter Beinart. “I feel like a crazy person. I feel as if I’m watching something that is so self-evidently inhumane and horrific. And to be told that I have to shut up because I risk the Jewish state by speaking out? I would say the opposite. I think they’re putting the likelihood of a surviving Jewish state much more at risk with this type of action.”And then there’s Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show on CBS. Colbert hasn’t spoken about Gaza a huge amount, although he did criticise the crackdown on student protests, saying: “Even if you don’t agree with the subject of their protests, as long as they are peaceful, students should be allowed to protest. It’s their first amendment right.” He has, however, been very outspoken about Trump. Last month, he said Paramount Global (whichowns CBS) deciding to pay a large settlement to Trump over content in a CBS show, 60 Minutes, amounted to a “big fat bribe”. Three days later, his show was cancelled – many suspect because Paramount higher-ups wanted to stay in Trump’s good books to get a merger approved. This seems to have worked.Trump has said: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.”I bet he does. Late-night hosts seem to be doing far more than certain other influential voices when it comes to speaking truth to power. None of this is funny – but when comedians become the most vocal truth-tellers, it’s possible your country has become a joke.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian US columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet, I wonder whether the tourists being courted truly understand the darker side ofRwanda. This side has torn my family apart for nearly two decades; it is the reason my mother sits behind bars, once again, as a political prisoner.My mother, Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, is a political activist who first returned to Rwanda from exile in 2010. Our family had a stable and comfortable life in the Netherlands for many years, but my mother could not stop thinking about her native Rwanda and was deeply troubled by the events unfolding there. The president,Paul Kagame, heralded as the man who stopped the 1994 genocide, was quietly becoming yet another strongman on the African continent. My mother could not silently watch from the sidelines in Europe as Rwanda’s citizens lost their freedoms and suffered persecution.She eventually returned to Rwanda seeking to challenge Kagame and run for the presidency, but these plans were quickly thwarted. Shortly after her return in 2010, she was arrested and forced to face charges of genocide ideology and terrorism in a trial that wasinternationally condemnedas unfair and a violation of her rights. She was sentenced to15 years in prison.My mother was in jail for eight years, much of that time in solitary confinement. When she received a presidential pardon in 2018 from President Kagame himself, we thought our family would finally have a chance to reunite. But even though she was no longer imprisoned, my mother was not free. She was prevented from running for elected office. To this day,her political party has not been allowed to officially register. The conditions of her pardon also required her to seek permission if she wanted to travel outside Rwanda, but despite her numerous requests, permission has never been granted.My mother has missed every important moment and milestone in our family’s life since her return to Rwanda, from graduations, to weddings, to the birth of her grandchildren. She has not even been allowed to visit her husband, my father, who has faced severe health challenges that have left him paralysed and gravely ill.Paul Kagame banned opponents like me from Rwanda’s election. No wonder he cruised to victory | Victoire Ingabire UmuhozaRead moreThe conditions of my mother’s pardon were set to expire in October of this year. We hoped and believed that this would mean she would have her freedoms and rights fully restored. When I visited her in Rwanda earlier this year – our first reunion in 15 years and the first time she has ever met my wife and children – we dared to plan to celebrate Christmas together. These hopes were dashed when she wasarrested on 19 June 2025. She now faces vague and politically motivated charges, including conspiracy to overthrow the government and spreading false information. She is awaiting what will certainly be a political trial, like the one she went through in 2010.Still, in many ways my mother is fortunate. She is alive. The same cannot be said for members of Dalfa Umurinzi, the political party she established. Since 2016, several members have gone missing, andothers have been murdered. Their political activism ultimately cost them the highest price, and our mother has often told us this terrible injustice motivates her to keep going in her fight for democracy and respect for human rights.The first time the Rwandan government imprisoned my mother, I was only a child, too young and scared to advocate for the mother I love and admire so deeply. But times have changed, and now I will use my voice whenever and however I can to draw attention to her unjust imprisonment and call for her freedom.View image in fullscreenVictoire Ingabire walks outside the Nyarugenge prison after being released on 15 September 2018.Photograph: Cyril Ndegeya/AFP/Getty ImagesI ask democratic leaders and governments around the world to hold Rwanda accountable for violating the standards of international law. Since Kagame became its leader, Rwanda has styled itself as a commendable success story in Africa and a worthy player in the international community. There are too few who question whyKagame wins elections by 99%of the vote while arrests, disappearances and even killings of his critics occur both within and outside Rwanda’s borders. We need more governments to raise these questions and demand answers.The country still depends heavily on overseas development assistance, so I join with those who argue that such aid should require Rwanda to ensure true democracy, liberty for all and justice according to the established rule of law.My mother, Victoire, and many other courageous dissidents in Rwanda have risked their lives to speak out for these values. Now I ask the international community to speak out for them. Rwanda needs a consensus democracy, one that solves political problems through dialogue, to move toward a better future for all. But this is impossible as long as an authoritarian regime maintains control. Hope for the freedom of dissidents like my mother, and for all citizens of Rwanda, rests in diplomatic intervention, political pressure and the media’s role in uncovering the true nature of the regime in Rwanda.Rémy Amahirwa is the oldest son of the Rwandan dissident Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza.

Now it turns out that by wanting to have dinner at 6pm, she is extremely fashionable.Curses!It’s all down to pesky gen Z, of course. Not content withslating our no-show socksand banning the French tuck, they’re now making early evenings the new late nights when it comes to dining. According tothe Times, online restaurant reservation service OpenTable reports a steep rise in 6pm bookings, up 11% in London and 6% across the UK compared with the same period last year. And Zonal, the hospitality tech service, reveals the new national average dining time is 6.12pm. Joe Laker, the savvy chef and co-founder of Counter 71 in Shoreditch, London, has introduced a £50 early evening set menu as a result, and will surely not be the last to do so.Beards may be dirtier than toilets – but all men should grow one | Polly HudsonRead moreThe benefits here are clear: you get to socialise without staying up till all hours and being forced to skip your 972-step skincare routine; commuters don’t risk missing the last train; and eating a large meal after 8pm is generally considered to beworse for your healththan dining earlier.But what about the inevitable knock-on effects of this new trend? After all, you’re unlikely to be hungry at 6pm if you had lunch at 2pm. At this rate, we might have to start setting our alarms for the middle of the night and having breakfast then, in order to squeeze in all our meals.

Democrats elsewhere should heed our mistakesKarolina WiguraandJarosław KuiszDonald Tusk has failed to offer a positive vision for the future. Without one, liberals will just be an interval between populist actsTue 5 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 11.15 EDTShareKarolina WiguraJarosław KuiszWe were travelling across Poland by train the day after the country’s sensational parliamentary elections in autumn 2023. When news of the results came through, passengers in our compartment fell into each other’s arms, rejoicing as though a great weight had been lifted from their shoulders. Hard as it was to believe after eight years, the national populists of the Law and Justice party had beenousted from poweron a record turnout of 75% of voters. We felt the potential of democracy to change things for the better as a physical sensation.Less than two years have passed but this enthusiasm has disappeared without trace. The Law and Justice-backed candidate Karol Nawrocki won thepresidential election run offin June with 50.89% of the vote, securing theadmiration of Donald Trumpin the process. Days before Nawrocki’s swearing in on Wednesday [6 August] a new poll suggested that almosthalf of voterswould like the prime minister, Donald Tusk out. The ruling coalition is wobbling. Tusk’s liberal democratic government may turn out to be nothing more than an intermezzo, a pause between rightwing populist governments.After more than a decade of living, in a global sense, with the new wave of populism, we can see a pattern of missed opportunities of which Poland is just one example. In countries ruled bynew populists, voters often come to feel disappointment and anger. In recent years, liberal candidates, carried by a tide of opposition, have ousted the populists: before Tusk managed it in Poland there was Joe Biden in the US,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvain Brazil andZuzana Čaputováin Slovakia. The victories of these politicians seemed briefly like beacons of hope for the post-cold war liberal democratic consensus.But rebuilding after populists vacate office can resemble a daily struggle in the political mud. A victorious election campaign is not the same as a definitive victory. The war against populists is a permanent one, and a global one, amplified by digital media.Post-populist rule is all the more difficult because populist governments leave behind a legal minefield. InPoland, countless legal decisions and acts in force were intended to undermine liberal democratic institutions. Dismantling them constitutionally and restoring the rule of law takes time and energy. It also requireslooking back to the past rather than focusing on the future as the new government addresses its predecessors’ mistakes. In Poland and Brazil, this has stifled any ambitions to offer an exciting roadmap for the years ahead. Inevitably, any initial euphoria is quickly followed by public frustration and the rise of another challenge from the rightwing populists.Since the anti-communistSolidarity movementin the 1980s, Poland has been a crucial laboratory in the battle for democracy. After returning to power in 2023, Tusk faced a dilemma: should he completely distance himself from his predecessors’ agenda or flirt with their legacy? Tusk chose the second option. He maintained the populists’ programme of direct financial support for families with children. He continued with the construction of a mega transport hub, a flagship project for the previous government that he had previouslyattacked as wasteful. It is especially striking that he has failed to liberalisePoland’s abortion laws, which were tightened by the populists. Echoing the nationalists’ rhetoric about migration and defence of national borders has led to Poland reimposing checks at itsborders with EU neighbours Germany and Lithuania, despite all three countries being in the Schengen area.Letting the national populists set the political tone for him is driving Tusk’s failure. The defeat of his presidential candidate, Rafał Trzaskowski was followed by a collapse of support in the polls. The absence of an inspiring vision, or even a sense of what Tusk stands for, is painful to witness.If parliamentary elections were held today, Poland’s rightwing populists would be emphatically returned to power, probably with an even more radical nationalist programme. Abroad, Tusk may be admired as a staunch defender of democracy. At home, he has become one of the most unpopular politicians in the country.Call it the Gorbachev syndrome: beloved internationally, but reviled domestically. Tusk’s ratings slump can be blamed on a whole set of unfulfilled promises, poor messaging and a poor presidential campaign. He is also affected by the global tendency to reject establishment politicians. To many Polish voters, especially younger ones, Tusk, who has been active in Polish politics for more than 25 years and was prime minister from 2007 to 2014, seems like part of a tired old elite whose time has come to step aside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, Tusk and Lula disappoint, just as Čaputová and Biden did before them. The message is lacking, but the medium is challenging too. So far, rightwing populists are winning on the battleground ofnew and social media.It is not the only example, but the Polish case clearly demonstrates the folly of fighting elections purely on the defensive. It is too little and too narrow. Liberal ambitions must extend further than preventing populists from coming to power or removing them from it.Elections have to be understood as a chance to rebuild democracy, and to do so in tune with the new media environment. Without a forward-thinking approach, the liberal intermezzo will remain just that: a brief interval between acts in a longer populist play. Democrats must learn this lesson – contending with populism means not only confronting the past, but also offering a compelling vision for the future.Karolina Wigura isa Polish historian and co-author ofPost-Traumatic Sovereignty: An Essay (Why the Eastern European Mentality is Different).

It has beenfound in Greenland’s ice cap, near the summit of Mount Everest, and in the deepest depths of the western Pacific Ocean. Nature programmes havesounded the alarmover a human-made crisis that has become an environmental scourge and aserious threat to our health. Yet global production of plastics ison course to tripleto more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060, after increasing by more than 200 times over the past 75 years.This gloomy backdrop should inject a sense of urgency into UN-convened talks in Switzerland this week, aimed at agreeing a binding global plastics treaty. In 2022, when 173 countries committed to work towards such an accord,there was widespread reliefthat at last a multilateral route was to be taken towards solving a quintessentially global problem. Sadly, as delegates gather in Geneva, there are reasons to be fearful.As major oil-producing countries seek to circumvent the consequences of the green transition, the fossil fuel-based manufacture of plastics has become a key battleground. During five rounds of negotiations, over three years, a “petrochemical bloc” led by Russia and Saudi Arabia has stalled and obstructed attempts to agree a reduction in production. And as arecent investigationby the Guardian laid bare, corporate capture of the talks has also become a significant problem. Industry lobbyists have sought to dominate and divert the debate, promoting implausible panaceas in the form of new recycling technologies and other mitigating measures.The return of Donald Trump to the White House is unlikely to improve the prospects of a truly ambitious reset. On the first day of his second term Mr Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, signalling his contempt for multilateralism and his unflinchingbacking for big oil. There are already signs that in Geneva the US plans to align itself with fellow fossil-fuel producers in resisting any attempt to agree to a reduction in virgin plastic production.Given such headwinds, the scale of the crisis bears reiteration. Ahead of this week’s talks,an expert reviewpublished in the Lancet described plastics as “a grave, growing and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health”. Thanks to television series such as Blue Planet II, the grievous impact on blighted marine ecosystems is relatively widely understood. But plastic production also contributesmore than 3%of annual global greenhouse emissions. Most insidiously, its ubiquitous presence in everyday life means that chemical additives and pollutants find their way into human bodies. According to the Lancet report, health-related damages globally add up to £1.1tn a year, with infants and children particularly vulnerable.Carrying on with business as usual, while seeking unlikely technological fixes, will not be good enough. A cap on global production is desperately needed, though achieving that in Geneva looks like a tall order. At last November’s talks in South Korea, more than 100 countries supported legally binding reductions but negotiations collapsed without an agreement.A consensus of sorts may be found on the need to eliminate harmful chemicals from future manufacture, and phasing out single-use plastics, which account forhalf of the 400m tonnesproduced every year. That would at least be a start. After years of obfuscation and delay, something tangible must emerge from Switzerland.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

They must be framed and interpreted. They are often weaponised. In Britain’s increasingly toxic debate over asylum and migration, the question isn’t just how many asylum seekers arrive onsmall boats. It’s what those numbers are made to represent – and why polls suggest a large proportion of the public now believes things that are simply untrue.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has staked her political credibility on restoring a sense of grip over the asylum system: reducing the backlog by processing cases, acceleratingreturnsof those with no legal claim to stay and launching an as yet small-scale “one in, one out” returns deal with France. In balancing operational realism with symbolic reassurance, Ms Cooper walks a knife-edge between policy and perception.The small boats issue is no longer just about shortcomings. It is a cultural firestorm – and one increasingly fuelled not by facts, but by misinformation. According to newYouGov polling, nearly half of Britons wrongly believe that illegal migrants now outnumber those here legally. A staggering 72% of those who support mass deportations hold this belief – even though official estimates show legal migration outnumbers irregular migration by at least 10 to 1. That gap between belief and reality is not accidental. It is the outcome of years of distortion by populist media and politicians who conflate asylum, illegality and criminality. Figures likeNigel FarageandRobert Jenrickhave led the charge, using cherrypicked statistics and lurid anecdote to foster the sense of a country under siege.Hotelshousing asylum seekers have become flashpoints for far-right protest. Last summer’s riots, frighteningly, appear to be no fluke. They look like a trial run.Ms Cooper’sstrategyto confront this with better data and a functioning system is, on paper, entirely rational. She wants to reassert the difference between political theatre and policy. But data alone cannot win a cultural war. Publishing the nationality or immigration status of offenders, even in the name of transparency, may serve only to reinforce the belief that “foreignness” explains criminality – particularly when the dominant public narrative is already so skewed. Amnesty’s warning that disclosing suspects’ ethnicity risks becoming a “lightning rod” for racist sentiment is well grounded. Moderate former Tory ministers have rightly urged caution, calling for accurate data and cooler heads. The former counter-terrorism chief Neil Basu is right to compare Faragism toTrumpism: both rely on lies about migrants that outpace the truth to win votes.The real problem isn’t the number of small boats, but the growing number of Britons who see all migration as a threat to identity and safety. YouGov finds that a significant proportion of the public now supports not just border control, but mass removals of migrants who have already settled here.That is a policy with no precedent in mainstream politicssince 1971. Worryingly, it is now slithering back intopublic debate.Labour inherited a broken asylum system. But it also inherited apoisoned political environment. The risk is that by trying to neutralise extremism with incremental reform and datasets, it lends legitimacy to the deeper narrative: that the migrant is, at root, the problem. Britain is playing with fire, not just because its systems are failing, but because the public’s trust in those systems has beenmethodically eroded. That is harder to repair. And far more dangerous to ignore.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The processes that Jonathan Whittall describes, the result of a siege and an unprecedented assault on international humanitarian organisations, have been known to anyone willing to listen, in Israel and in the west, for a very long time (I saw many atrocities as a senior aid official in Gaza. Now Israeli authorities are trying to silence us, 3 August).Israel’s siege, which has fluctuated in its totality since 7 October, limited the amounts of food, medication and essential supplies allowed into the Gaza Strip, culminating in a complete siege from March to May 2025. Israel’s assault on international organisations started with a campaign against Unrwa, the UN agency dedicated to the care for Palestinian refugees, and developed into a set of regulations aimed at intimidating international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) and obstructing their ability to work in the occupiedPalestinian territories.The effect has been the replacement of reputable humanitarian organisations by an Israeli-funded private enterprise (the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation), with no experience in humanitarian aid or commitment to human wellbeing. The result is the reported starvation to death of more than 100 Palestinians and the shooting of Palestinians who sought aid, killing and injuring many thousands. Human life in the Gaza Strip has become exceedingly cheap.For us, as Israeli citizens who believe in the sanctity of all human life, the current moment represents our own failure, alongside the failure of international law, the international community and most media outlets. During Whittall’s term in office as head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), it has been an unrelenting source of information regarding the systematic assault on human life in the occupied territories. We applaud Whittall for speaking out. OCHA and other INGOs need the backing of governments and the international community to restore a human-oriented humanitarian system and save those who can still be saved.Dr Lee MordechaiHistory department,Hebrew University of JerusalemProf Liat KozmaDepartment of Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, Hebrew University of JerusalemHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I also trained as a doctor during the 80s and early 90s and experienced the long working hours of that time. It is easy to fall into the trap of nostalgia and selective memory as we become older and detached from the frontline. I was looked after by the hospitals in which I worked, which were less managed than they are today. I worked in a close team, led by a consultant to whom I was responsible, and who was responsible for me. I spoke to no managers. I was provided accommodation, hot food day and night, and other privileges.I speak to many young doctors in my current workplace and see the conditions in which they work. They are isolated and harassed by managers, who are in turn harassed by a target-driven culture. Their training is politicised and diluted by the physician assistant programme. They cannot get hot food after 4pm or at weekends, they pay for parking, they are ripped off by hospital accommodation services and see their pay eroded by below-inflation awards over many years. Small wonder they are angry.Payis the quickest way by which they can obtain some redress for the deterioration in working conditions which they have suffered.Dr Robin HollandsConsultant, ShrewsburyAs a foundation year 1 (FY1) doctor who has nearly completed my first year of medical training, I have been deeply disheartened by the discourse around the resident doctor strikes. The British Medical Association (BMA) has failed to properly advocate for changes that will improve the working lives of doctors and the media has unsurprisingly been intensely critical of the BMA’s current objectives. It was exceptionally generous for the government to provide us with a22% pay rise last year, but theBMA’s current demands for a further 29%are totally unrealistic and appear tone deaf to the many other public sector workers who have received much less. It is therefore not surprising that many media outlets have agreed that we are “greedy”.Despite this, I believe the strikes are a representation of a much deeper dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs for resident doctors and this needs to be addressed. Resident doctors across the country are often working extensive hours on understaffed, dysfunctional hospital wards, with now ever-diminishing prospects of career progression. The latest BMA figures that52% of FY2 doctors have no secure employment from Augustis deeply shocking and is a failure of the system that may threaten the future of the NHS.It is time that both the BMA and the government woke up to the reality that there will be a severe doctor unemployment crisis unless urgent action is taken. This is the real problem that needs to be addressed. Pay restoration should absolutely remain a long-term goal, but there is little point improving my current resident doctor salary if there are no future pathways for resident doctors in theNHS.Dr Will GiffinSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

What is the world coming to? How dare these women speak knowledgably in articulate sentences and joyful tones? And like “Mrs Dave”, my sister joined in and supported the patriarchal point!The conversation continued along this vein for some time, eventually arriving at the well-worn waffle about “women can’t play football as well as men and shouldn’t be paid the same, blah blah blah…”Helen JohnsonNottinghamI ask myself why some men are so antagonistic to women’s football, why they feel it is being “thrown down our throats”, and why they can become so wound up by women’s voices and generally be so misogynistic and so open about their poisonous beliefs. My guess would be that they feel jealous and under threat.Not since the heady days of women’s football attracting large crowds (likeDick, Kerr Ladies, who drew a crowd of 53,000 at Goodison Park on Boxing Day 1920) has women’s football been so popular. But the men were back from war, and it was time for them to have their game back. So, obligingly, the FA disallowed women from playing on affiliated pitches for half a century.In men’s football, England has led the way with the formation of thePremier League, attracting players and fans from around the world – even if, internationally, we always fall at the last hurdle, or before. Then along came the women’s troops, gaining attention after much ridicule and playing good football – and not rolling around on the floor and berating the referee. There are plenty of sports on TV, to watch or not. The “Dave from Egham” types should get on with their own lives and stop being such haters – it’s bad for their health.Laura FarninghamVejer de La Frontera,SpainWhat Barney Ronay describes as the happiness of the Euros is, to my mind, just what sport should be. The sport was competitive, exciting and skilful, but there was still a sense of proportion. It was sport, not life, and the people playing it went back to homes that were something like those of their fans. Sport is a game, chaps. You can still celebrate endeavour and skill, but just stop taking it all so seriously. The Lionesses showed us, again, that sport can be pure joy.Kathryn StreatfieldRichmond, North YorkshireI arrived in the British Isles in 1968 and was completely mystified by the warfare between football fans. I’d support whatever team appealed at the time and could never drum up any hatred for the other side. I hadn’t realised that I was watching, and enjoying, the women’s football because that anger and threat of violence was missing.

Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersFaith in young manager Fabian Hürzeler, and a reshaped defence, gives hope of a sustained push for European placeByEd AaronsTue 5 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 19.32 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:8th (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:8thProspectsBrighton kitsAlthough Brighton missed out on qualifying for Europe again, there was a sense of optimism rather than disappointment at the end of Fabian Hürzeler’s first season at the helm. Had it not been for a costly loss of form in the spring that brought one point from four league games and adefeat by Nottingham Forest on penalties in the last eightof the FA Cup, the German head coach might even have matched his predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi’s achievement of finishing sixth.After a raft of injuries to key players all season and with several signings from a summer spending spree of almost £200m struggling to settle, it was to Hürzeler’s credit that his team ended only one point short of Brighton’s record points tally from 2023 after three wins to round off the campaign. Now, in the words of chair Tony Bloom, with the youngest permanent Premier League manager having gained a year’s experience, “we are hoping for more next season”.Brighton scored 66 goals – the joint fifth-highest in the division – so much will depend on strengthening a defence that conceded 59, with the emphasis this summer on finding a long-term replacement for the veteran captain Lewis Dunk as he enters the last year of his contract. Diego Coppola, an Italy Under-21 centre-back, and Olivier Boscagli, who arrived on a free transfer from PSV, will be joined by the exciting Belgium left-back Maxim De Cuyper as Hürzeler hopes to build a more settled unit.The departure of João Pedro, who became thelatest Brighton player to join Chelsea, has been offset by the signing of the highly regarded 18-year-old striker Charalampos Kostoulas. His fellow Greece Under-21 international Stefanos Tzimas andSunderland’s playoff hero Tommy Watsonwill provide more attacking options for a squad that still includes the outstanding Kaoru Mitoma despite speculation he could depart and looks equipped to maintain a sustained push for Europe.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerHürzeler is guaranteed to wear his heart on his sleeve and has proved a hit with Brighton’s supporters after the popular De Zerbi’s departure. In an interview with British GQ in April, the 32-year-old revealed that he loves watches and Coldplay but never sits down in front of the television because there “are so many better things to do”. “I’m a big believer that the limit for our body is really high, and I think we don’t always try to push our limits,” he said. Brighton’s players should be well prepared for the start of the season in that case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

João Pedro’s departure for £60m will help to balance the books after lastsummer’s massive outlay made them the biggest net spenders in Europe. Bloom, who bought 29% of the Scottish club Hearts in June, is estimated to have invested more than £400m at his home-town club since becoming chair in 2009. In April, the long-serving chief executive, Paul Barber, committed his future until 2030.Last season’s resultsStar signingMuch is expected of Kostoulas after Brighton saw off interest from several other clubs, including Chelsea, to snap him up for an initial fee of almost £30m that could rise by £2m to make him the most expensive Greek player in history. Represented by the same agent who tookGiannis Antetokounmpoto the NBA, he became the youngest player to make a professional appearance for Olympiakos when he represented their B team at 15 years and seven months, before he was part of the side that won the prestigious Uefa Youth League last year. Kostoulas will learn plenty from the evergreen Danny Welbeck, who finished as last season’s joint top scorer and turns 35 in November.Stepping upBart Verbruggen, having strangely alternated with Jason Steele under De Zerbi, was preferred between the sticks by Hürzeler last season but the Dutchman made several costly errors. Nonetheless, a recent survey by the Swiss research group CIES Football Observatory identified the 22-year-old as potentially the world’s most valuable goalkeeper with a projected fee of £54m. Verbruggen, who joined Brighton in 2023 from Anderlecht for £16m, will need to show more consistency to retain Hürzeler’s faith, although the England Under-21 goalkeeper James Beadle was allowed to join Birmingham on loan rather than provide more competition for the Netherlands international.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Brighton & Hove AlbionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The next major city is Leeds, two hours drive to the south … London feels very far away.”If Eddie Howe can only hope his prospective signings do not stumble across the Rough Guides introduction to England’s northern cities, Newcastle’s manager may also reflect that it was not supposed to be like this.Manchester United rival Newcastle with Sesko bid and believe he prefers Old TraffordRead moreThe days when the club’s recruitment strategy was often a victim of its geographical isolation were supposed to have ended four years ago when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fundobtained the keys to St James’ Park.In October 2021 there was a sense of giddiness in the Tyneside air as Amanda Staveley, the then Newcastle director and minority owner who played a key role in convincing one of the world’s richest sovereign wealth funds to buy the club from Mike Ashley, settled back into a sofa at the city’s leafy Jesmond Dene House hotel and spoke of soaring ambition and trophies galore.Since then a series of leading players including Alexander Isak, Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimarães have signed for Newcastle, Howe’s team are in the Champions League for the second time in three years and are theholders of the Carabao Cup, their first domestic trophy for 70 years.Rather less positively, Isak is doing his utmost toforce through a move to Liverpool, a slew of big names have turned down Howe in favour of relocating to London or Manchester this summer and Newcastle are seeking their third sporting director and second chief executive in three years.Oh and Staveley and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, are no longer around, after being ousted in a boardroom power struggle last summer. Staveley spoke subsequently of her “heartbreak” and “devastation” at that departure, insisting rumours of a planned exit were “absolute rubbish”.Thirteen months on Newcastle’s chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan, and the rest of the Riyadh-based Saudi ownership are perhaps realising that maybe she was more important to their Geordie project than they realised. Arguably almost everything that has subsequently gone wrong seems rooted in that parting of the ways.View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s Eddie Howe has seen a number of transfer targets sign for rival clubs.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesCrucially, Staveley and Ghodoussi were excellent communicators within a club where, at assorted levels, personal connections have since loosened and the Saudi ownership remain so remote that no representative of PIF has spoken to the UK football media.In contrast Staveley was big on the human touch, taking time to stop and chat to players, staff and, occasionally, reporters while also sending first-teamers regular text messages as she established rare trust with the instinctively wary Howe. Maybe Staveley sometimes over-promised. Isak’s representatives certainly believe the striker was assured his £150,000-a-week wages would be boosted significantly last summer and the fallout is hurting Howe now.Yet given that Newcastle only narrowly avoided a potential points deduction and heavy fine after scrambling to comply with Premier League spending rules within hours of a key deadline last June, the club’s decision to tell Isak he would have to be content with his current deal after all represented financial logic.Howe’s problem was that a striker who proceeded to score 27 goals last season remained seriously annoyed. Indeed Isak, along with certain similarly sulky teammates, started the campaign badly and it took the manager’s considerable man-management skills to talk them round. It did not go unnoticed that, after the Carabao Cup triumph, Isak’s body language turned uninterested again.Even so, the Swede had three years on his contract and there was a – misplaced – sense that a supposedly “laid-back” character would not “rock the boat”, let alone skip a pre-season tour of south east Asia, particularly as he was poised to be offered an improved contract this summer.Instead Liverpool’s interest turned the head of a striker said to be disappointed that there is still no sign of a much-vaunted new training ground at a club where a long-awaited, and much-delayed, decision as to whether Newcastle will revamp St James’ Park or build a new stadium has again been postponed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAt a time when, given the constraints of profitability and sustainability rules, the art of selling is just as important as buying players, moving Isak to Liverpool for £120m-plus this month makes sense, permitting Howe to restock a talented but slender squad.The real puzzle is the lack of honest springtime conversations with Isak that might have allowed Newcastle to force an auction involving Liverpool, Arsenal et al before using their handsome profit to source an elite replacement.Instead Liam Delap, João Pedro, Hugo Ekitiké andnow, perhaps, Benjamin Seskohave slipped through the net, preferring to move to London or Manchester.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak is doing his utmost to force through a move to Liverpool.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PANewcastle, though, is not exactly Siberia and might have proved an easier sell had the Saudis swiftly appointed a successor to Darren Eales, who announced his resignation as chief executive 11 months ago after a blood cancer diagnosis.Eales finally seems about to be replaced by the Canadian former Real Madrid executive David Hopkinson, but Paul Mitchell’s abrupt departure “by mutual consent”, announced in late May, dictates that Newcastle have spent the transfer window without a sporting director.Mitchell, who succeeded Dan Ashworth last July, left without signing a player after kicking off his tenure by declaring that the transfer strategy was “unfit for purpose” and the manager needed “to evolve”.An uneasy truce with Howe eventually ensued but, less than 24 hours after Mitchell and the manager met Rumayyan for a post-season planning summit, his impending exit was announced.Throw in the enduring silence from Saudi Arabia and it is easy to understand why a footballer’s agent might tell his client that, although Howe is clearly a brilliant coach, Newcastle look a bit dysfunctional right now. Geography may no longer be the main reason why top players steer clear of Tyneside.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedanalysisShareReuse this content"

Gassama, signed this summer from Sheffield Wednesday, scored his side’s third in the 51st minute to put the Govan side into a commanding lead and eventually a comfortable win.Martin said: “I really enjoyed it. I’m proud of the guys. We had a really difficult evening on Saturday, just because there was not enough running in behind, aggression, intensity with the ball. We were not just ranting and raving, we showed a lot of clips and we tried to do a lot of learning in the meeting room and on the pitch in the last couple of days and they took it on brilliantly.“The guys that came in the team were fantastic. We’re going to need everyone. You don’t get dropped from this team, people come in and out quite a lot because we need to be fresh.”Martin claimed Tavernier was understanding of Martin’s decision to leave him on the sidelines. He said: “Yeah, yeah, he was great – all the guys. I say my piece, if they have a piece to say, then it’s really respectful and really honest. But I think the way he played when he came on showed you everything you need to know. So there’s been no problem and I don’t envisage there being any problems moving forward.”View image in fullscreenDjeidi Gassama scores Rangers’ first goal after seven minutes at Ibrox.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockRangers will be heavy favourites to progress to a playoff tie against the Austrian side RB Salzburg or Club Brugge of Belgium.After pointing the finger at his underperformers at the weekend, all eyes were on Martin’s team selection and he made significant changes. Along with Tavernier and Raskin – arguably their best player last season – Danilo and Kieran Dowell were left out.Oliver Antman, the Finland winger who joined from Go Ahead Eagles on Monday, made his debut with the left-back Jefté, the midfielder Lyall Cameron and Dessers returning while John Souttar was named captain.The Ibrox crowd was more subdued than usual on a big European night, initially. In the seventh minute Plzen’s lofty striker Rafiu Durosinmi headed a cross from Amar Memic past the post but it was Gassama who struck first, playing a one-two with Dessers at the edge of the visitors’ box before confidently curling the ball past the goalkeeper Florian Wiegele.View image in fullscreenRussell Martin congratulates Djeidi Gassama after Rangers’ victory.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAfter the Rangers defender Nasser Djiga brilliantly blocked a goal-bound shot from the visiting captain ,Matej Vydra, Antman’s drive from a Gassama cut-back at the other end was cleared off the line by Vaclav Jemelka.When a driving run into the box by Antman ended with him being barged over by Vydra, Turpin pointed to the spot for a soft penalty and Dessers sent Wiegele the wrong way.Rangers started the second half strongly and within three minutes the midfielder Mohamed Diomande struck the bar with an effort from the edge of the box. However, the third soon arrived as Gassama grabbed his second when he bulleted in a header from a pinpoint Antman cross from the right to score his fourth goal in the past three European matches.Raskin, Danilo, and Tavernier all came off the bench when the job was done before the home keeper Jack Butland made a good save from a powerful drive from Memic.Malmö’shome matchagainst their local rivalsFC Copenhagenended in a goalless draw.

According to Kick It Out’s data,reports of sexism and misogynyrose by 67% on the year before, up from 115 to 192.Reports of online sexism rose by 72% while reports related to misogyny in youth football doubled. Within stadiums, 18 reports of sexist chanting at matches were recorded, almost equalling the total from the previous four seasons combined.The uptick in reporting is likely in part down to greater awareness, both of the tools available to combat abuse and of the women’s game itself. Kick It Out partnered with Women In Football last year to call for a crackdown on sexist behaviour and for incidents to be incorporated into official police statistics. The rise in popularity in women’s football has been dogged by a growth in people criticising its validity, especially on social media.Ableist abuse also rose substantially last season, increasing by 45% on the year, but there was a small decline in homophobic abuse. Reports of racism also fell overall, though Kick it Out says racism remains “prevalent” online, and the number of incidents reported in the professional game increased from 223 to 245.“What we’re seeing now is that fans aren’t just reporting abuse, they’re demanding action,” Samuel Okafor, the chief executive of Kick It Out, said. “There’s been a clear shift this season in how people are calling out sexist behaviour, both online and in stadiums, and asking football to treat it as seriously as any other form of hate.“At the same time, it’s clear that online platforms are still falling short. The volume of abuse remains high, and too often those responsible face no consequences. Fans are doing their part by speaking up. It’s now up to football authorities, tech companies and government to show they’re listening, and to act.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not that Mohammed Siraj, still hitting 90mph on the speed gun on the 25th day, showed weariness. If anything, he could well hold the key to solving the world’s energy problems.Plaudits in particular go to three men who stepped up bravely when other sports would have simply subbed them off: Shoaib Bashir bowled with a broken left hand at Lord’s; Rishabh Pant batted with a broken foot at Old Trafford; and then Chris Woakes, Horatio Nelson armed with a Gray-Nicolls, followed him in folklore at the Oval. Don’t be fooled by the white flannels and the stoppages for tea – Test cricket is a brutal sport.England 2-2 India: player ratings for the Test seriesRead moreIt is also a sport of opinion, with one sticking out in the wash up: a common refrain that England getting over the line at the Oval to win 3-1 - ie the other side of one of the tightest games you’ll see - would have been a “travesty”. After all, India were the away side, dominated the run charts – four players in the top five – and had four of the six leading wicket-takers. They won more sessions, goes the argument, and lost all five tosses, indisputably.Sure. But a travesty? England chased down 371 to win at Headingley, defended a mere 193 at Lord’s, and then, at 2-1 up, forced India into a remarkable rearguard at Old Trafford by sticking 669 on the board – the highest total of the series. Had this been followed by 10 men reeling in 374 at the Oval, their second‑highest run chase and breaking the ground’s 123-year-old record by 111 runs, 3-1 would surely have been well earned.None of which is to say a fair outcome was not landed upon. Shubman Gill’s never-say-die tourists won the deciding final round with a serious display of heart and skill. They were more than good value for the drawn series. The point is more that Test scorelines reflect all outputs – teams are only as strong as their weakest links – and even then can still come down to clutch moments or freak incidents. The 2009 Ashes, when Australia similarly dominated the runs and wickets charts yet lost 2-1, comes to mind.Quick GuideMcCullum: India series will prime us for AshesShowBrendon McCullum accepts England have \"room to improve\" before the Ashes but the head coach believes the intensity of their dramatic drawn series against India will help them to meet the challenge.McCullum was honest enough to chalk up the 2-2 scoreline as a \"fair reflection\" on seven weeks of hard-fought, demanding cricket, with India grabbing a share of the new Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy with a thrilling six-run win at the Oval. That meant England were one hit from claiming an outright victory that would have sent them to Australia this winter with the biggest scalp of the Bazball era. Instead, they will travel having last defeated one of their \"big three\" rivals in Alastair Cook's farewell series in 2018.\"It's been a magnificent series, as good as I've been involved with or witnessed in my time. We played some excellent cricket and at times, with the pressure India put us under, we came up a little bit short,\" McCullum said.\"You're always learning any time you get to see guys having to dig deep and go to places they've maybe not been before. We'll let this one sit and we'll digest it.\"We're in the middle now, halfway through what we knew was going to be an unbelievable 12 months of Test cricket. We know we've got some room to improve. But to be involved in a series of such pressure over a period like this teaches you to be tough and builds resilience within you. A lot of our guys will have learnt a lot and that can only be a good thing.\"One thing England may reflect on is their decision to keep the emerging talent of Jacob Bethell in camp for the most of the summer, rather than releasing him to play first-class cricket. He has played just one County Championship match for Warwickshire this year, while travelling as a non-playing squad member with the Test team. When he was called on as Ben Stokes's injury replacement, he made 11 runs in two innings and was dismissed in a pressurised chase playing a wild slog. McCullum refused to chide him for that, though.\"Beth will be back and better for the experience, I'm sure he'll learn from it. The good thing was he took the positive option. He got out doing it, but no one ever regretted being positive, right?\"Photograph: Chris Foxwell/Shutterstock EditorialWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.So does the next Ashes, inevitably – something which England’s head coach, Brendon McCullum, fancies his players will now be hardened for given the intensity of the cricket in the past six weeks. Although it is a concerning trend that in five of their past six series they have won the first Test and lost the last and no, with World Test Championship points at stake these days, none of them can be described as dead rubbers.The Ashes schedule thankfully has more generous spacing than the series just gone, with two nine-day breaks separating the first, second and third Tests. A cynic might wonder if it has been devised to get Australia’s great yet greybeard attack through what tends to be the “live” bit. Either way, this can only be a good thing, giving the best players the best chance to stay on the park and in turn producing the best possible spectacle.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Chris Woakes batting against India at the Oval with his arm in a sling was the third instance of a player stepping up despite an injury.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockEngland will certainly not be complaining, with their fast‑bowling stocks stretched to breaking point against India. For all the promise of Jofra Archer’s 90mph-plus return, and Gus Atkinson with eight wickets on his Test comeback, it is hard to escape the sense that their hopes of competing in Australia hinge onBen Stokesplaying as a fully fledged all-rounder. This was his best series with the ball, 17 wickets at 25, quick and skilful. But bits still flew off and he ended it watching the finale from the sidelines.In terms of the batting, not a great deal has been learned, which is to say their strengths and weaknesses remain roughly the same: murderous when the conditions are in their favour, vulnerable when the ball moves, and pegged around the all-time greatness of Joe Root. Increased pragmatism? This did occur but chiefly when Jasprit Bumrah was playing, not least the steady climb to 387 at Lord’s with an uncharacteristic run-rate of 3.44.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They struggled to cope with a Dukes ball that swung late in its life (a turnaround from the ones that turned to mush earlier in the series). Leaning into their aggressive tendencies has served them well in the main but, as has been widely noted, the surfaces in Australia have been spicier of late. The Kookaburra ball’s seam stays prominent for longer, too.Perhaps the bigger miss was the final day at Edgbaston, rather than falling just short of their latest huge chase. After a morning lost to rain England were tasked with seeing out 80 overs from three down, aided by a flat pitch on which bowlers struggled for impact with the older ball. Yet they lasted just 52.1 overs on the day. Compare and contrast with India seeing out five sessions in Manchester from a starting point of none for two (even if Root dropping Ravindra Jadeja first ball was another sliding doors moment).View image in fullscreenEngland’s Ollie Pope had a fairly typical series against India with one century and an average of 34 batting at No 3.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAWith no more Tests before the big push it appears only injury will dislodge the incumbents in the top seven. The sight of Stokes consoling Jacob Bethell after his tortured 31-ball five during the final collapse was probably driven in part by guilt at a young talent not exactly being given the best chance to succeed. Ollie Pope, even after another series that featured an early century but a final average of 34, will likely start at No 3 in Perth.All of which sounds a bit downbeat about a side that came within one hit of beating an India team who, save for Bumrah breaking down during the deciding Sydney Test, might well have drawn 2-2 in Australia earlier this year. Nevertheless, they will need to improve in a number of areas if they are to change the perceptions in that part of the world.Explore more on these topicsCricketBen StokesEngland cricket teamIndia cricket teamEngland v India 2025The AshesanalysisShareReuse this content"

Mohammed Siraj is still on the mind, bowling, always bowling, programmed to wobble it in at off‑stump until the collapse of civilisation. Anyonewho witnessed Chris Woakes, scrapping for singles with his slinged‑up arm, merits a week off to head to the sauna, play the vinyls, whatever gets you to decompress.But this is the English cricketing summer, refusing to give you a minute, packed beyond comprehension. A day after the conclusion of the Test summer, it was time to start the Hundred north of the river with the capital double-header: London Spirit against Oval Invincibles.Next up, the Ashes – and England will need Ben Stokes at his all-round best | Ali MartinRead moreThis is a stopgap season, the final year before new team owners – including four Indian Premier League franchises – enter with their own ideas of how to make this thing sing. For now, it is the same old tricks: fireworks in the daylight to kick off the new tournament and the awkwardness of the pop-up DJ booth, trying its best to convince those in: cricket is cool, cricket is cool, please kids believe me, cricket is cool.Away from the gimmicks, there is quality. The Spirit womenare the defending champions, with their opponents two-time winners. It was only right that the first ball of the new edition was bowled by the Invincibles’ Marizanne Kapp, the South Africa all‑rounder who has excelled in every season, orchestrating their final victories on this ground. She bowled 10 on the trot and hooped the last of those into Georgia Redmayne to celebrate the first wicket.From there it was a game of Australian power. Grace Harris starred in Surrey’s victory in the Blast last month but is calling Lord’s home at the moment. She was brutal against the leggies of Amanda‑Jade Wellington, her compatriot, smashing 89 off 42 balls as the Spirit finished on 176 for five, the second-highest total in the women’s Hundred. Cordelia Griffith, whose previous four seasons in the competition had returned a high score of 30 not out, finally had the glory of a half-century.Then came the Invincibles’ Meg Lanning, the former Australia captain playing against the side she represented last year. There was scratchiness in her start, 24 off her first 27 deliveries, costly in a chase requiring immediate impact. But then the strokes flowed. With 47 required off 14 balls, Lanning unleashed on Eva Gray, 20 taken off the next four deliveries, the cut shot a reminder of her days as a giant of the international game. A riveting finish was on until Issy Wong intervened, Lanning restricted to 85, the Spirit victors by 17 runs.View image in fullscreenGrace Harris delivered brutal power for London Spirit in their opening win.Photograph: Keeran Marquis/SPP/ShutterstockDuring the break between games, members of the “Tech Titans” consortium, the incoming co-owners of the Spirit, surveyed the view from the media centre, taking in what they have signed up for. The start by the women’s side would have pleased them and there must have been some excitement when Spirit’s men walked out to bat. Kane Williamson is their new captain, David Warner is present at the top of the order. The pair no longer reign over the IPL – they won it together at Sunrisers Hyderabad nine years ago – but the Hundred will take star names where it can.The runs, though, will have to wait another day. Both departed for single-figure scores against the Invincibles, who havewon the past two men’s competitions. In fact, the two‑figure score was a rarity as the Spirit crumbled, bowled out for just 80 as Rashid Khan and Sam Curran shared six wickets. The former’s twirl is a new addition to the Invincibles, a significant flex to call upon the leading wicket-taker in T20 cricket as you chase three in a row.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Liam Dawson finding some turn to bowl Tawanda Muyeye did not muster as much excitement.

Larson was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1995 for involvement in drug dealing and rebuilt his career as a caddie for several leadingPGA Tourplayers after serving 10 years.Scottie Scheffler claims Open Championship with majestic four-shot winRead moreLarson’s past had been largely forgotten until the Scottish Open, when it was revealed that any American citizen given a custodial sentence of at least 12 months will now be denied UK entry. ETA implementation started in January this year.Larson was refused travel despite lobbying to the Home Office from the PGA Tour and the R&A. English tied 22nd in Scotland and finished second in the Open. Caddies typically receive around 10% of their player’s winnings; English earned more than £1.8m from his UK trip. As things stand, Larson will encounter the same situation in 2026.The American bodies will point to the fact thatDonald Trump’s ban on citizensfrom a dozen countries entering the US – another seven have been served with restrictions – contains an exemption intended to apply to players, staff or associated families linked to the 2026 Fifa World Cup or the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games. No such leeway exists presently for the UK border.“Sporting bodies are now asking the UK to apply sporting exemptions on this system,” a senior figure within US sport said. The Home Office did not offer comment on whether it has already been asked to apply sporting exemptions on the ETA and what any response towards this might be.A source with knowledge of the Home Office position said: “Each application for a decision outside the rules is considered on its merits but informed by previous examples and precedents.”The same source confirmed the “mandatory and automatic refusal of entry clearance for individuals who have received a previous custodial sentence of at least 12 months”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Who can forgetRoss County deleting their own website, Kirk Broadfootsuffering facial burns after microwaving an eggand former Hearts manager Robbie Neilson trying to give journalists the slip as he left the club’s training ground by sending out a decoy (sports scientist John Hill) to the car parkin a Robbie Neilson mask. Edinburgh, very much the second city in Scotland when it comes to football, still has one of the game’s finest rivalries between two grand old clubs, Hearts and Hibernian. Each have had their moments in recent derbies: last year Hearts’ Lawrence Shankland celebrated scoring a penaltyby catching and eating a pie thrown by a Hibs supporter. In March, Jack Iredalescored a screamerto win the derby for Hibs. The post-match celebrations at Easter Road featured one ofthe finest ever renditions of Sunshine on Leith, a song sung with so much feeling that it left some Hibs players in tears. And who can blame them? If you get goosebumps watching that song, imagine what it must be like to come from that corner of Scotland, stand on that terrace and sing those lyrics in front of your victorious team. Magic.The point is, fitba is far greater than just Rangers and Celtic. And this is very much the opinion of Tony Bloom, the owner of Brighton who bought a 29% stake in Hearts this summer for £9.86m. Following the club’s opening win over Aberdeen – a 2-0 victory that leaves the Jambos top of the Premiership table – Bloom was in a bullish mood as he faced the media, explaining that he thinks Hearts can challenge for glory. “If we have not won the league title in the next 10 years, I will be very disappointed,” Bloom stated. “I want to make sure that we are in the talk to win the title at the start of each season.”We have heard this sort of patter before, a new owner coming in and telling a club’s supporters what they want to hear. The difference is, Bloom has a track record of using his army of data nerds and analytics gurus to drastically improve clubs with savvy recruitment. Brighton are now one of the best run clubs in England, while Union Saint-Gilloise, who were bottom of Belgium’s second tier when the Englishman took over in 2018, won the Belgian top flight a few months ago for the first time in 90 years and are in Bigger Cup.The last time a club that wasn’t called Celtic or Rangers won the Scottish Premiership was 1985 and the last time Hearts won it was 65 years ago, but Bloom seems untroubled. “I understand there will be a lot of Celtic and Rangers fans, maybe Hibs and Aberdeen fans, who will be laughing and saying ‘we’ve heard it all before’,” he blathered. “I just thought there was an opportunity here to shake things up in Scotland. I think we’ve got a very good chance of at least being second this season. I’ve just got a lot more confidence of what Hearts can do compared to when I did my first press conference at Union seven years ago.”Bloom has wasted no time in bringing in a new striker, Cláudio Braga, who (very much in the Brighton ilk) was signed from Norwegian second-division side FK Aalesunds for around £400,000. The Portuguese bagged four goals in five pre-season matches – including one in a 3-0 win over Premier League Sunderland – and already has a chant among the Tynecastle faithful:“All we need is … Cláudio Braga,”set to the tune of the Queen classic. Sunshine on Leith it is not, but Hearts fans will be getting goosebumps regardless.QUOTE OF THE DAYA couple of friends had come over to see me, we were chatting, and suddenly they said they couldn’t understand what I was saying.

Singh appears to have hit back by seeking to ensure that Stelling is denied hospitality at Hartlepool’s away matches, which begin at Yeovil on Saturday.‘It becomes your life’: Holmesdale Fanatics take Palace’s fight to the authoritiesRead more“You may be aware from media coverage that Jeff Stelling has resigned as Honorary President of Hartlepool United Football Club,” Singh wrote in a letter sent last week. “As Chairman of Hartlepool United Football Club I would kindly and considerately ask that Mr Stelling is therefore not provided with official HUFC dignitary spaces in your board room, or equivalent, for any Hartlepool United fixture at your home ground.“In the unlikely event that Mr Stelling independently attends any Hartlepool United fixture at your home ground, I’d further request that you consider to seat Mr Stelling separately to any HUFC dignitaries or staff.”Stelling resigned after it became clear that a consortium’s proposed takeover was not progressing. The group led by the local businesswoman Shirley Hammond is understood to have grown frustrated that talks have stalled.“I know this is only an honorary role, but it is the best way I felt I could protest against the treatment of the party trying to take control of the club,” Stelling said when he resigned. “Supporters have been left in an intolerable position with a perceived threat to the future of the club should they not support the current owner.”Singh has since proposed holding a vote among season-ticket holders over whether he should stay in charge, although that has yet to take place.Stelling is a lifelong Hartlepool fan who often used his position as host of Sky Sports’ live scores and results programme, Soccer Saturday, which he presented for 29 years until 2023,to promote the club. In 2016 he was appointed as the club’s honorary president in place of Peter Mandelson, who was MP for Hartlepool from 1992 to 2004.Singh saved Hartlepool from liquidation when buying the then League Two club and investing £1.8m, but the club have struggled in recent seasons.

There are also at least eight planned demonstrations outside hotels housing asylum seekers.The Ministry of Justice confirmed it had initiated “capacity gold command” as it attempts to manage the use of prison cells, with jails acrossEnglandand Wales 97.5% full.Capacity gold command is initiated when the number of prisoners across the estate reaches critical levels. It allows an appointed gold commander to monitor every out-of-use cell, direct moves into and out of prisons and maximise the use of open prisons and home detention curfews.Government sources said the justice department had re-examined the possibility of launching Operation Early Dawn, which would allow defendants to be held in police cells until prison beds become available and could mean their court dates were delayed or adjourned at short notice.Tom Wheatley, the president of the Prison Governors’ Association, said he was concerned about the impact on prisons of possible public order events after the riots in 2024 after the Southport murders.How will police respond to rally against Palestine Action ban?Read moreHe said: “Any spike in the numbers of people remanded in custody will have an impact on prisons. HMPPS HQ is again operating ‘capacity gold command’ arrangements to direct governors to move prisoners to ensure capacity is available. Governors in reception prisons will be directed to move prisoners over the weekend in order to create space.“This will mean sometimes moving prisoners long distances to prisons that have room to create it in those that don’t. This is far from ideal in that resettling prisoners from prisons a long way from where they are going to live on release is difficult logistically and less likely to be successful.”Sources said capacity gold command was activated in February 2023 and ended in September 2024, when Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary and lord chancellor,initiated an early release scheme.Because of overcrowding, a source said it was reactivated in March this year so that senior officials and ministers were informed about individual cell space.Saturday’s protest against the ban on Palestine Action will go ahead, organisers have said, despite the police sayingthey will carry out mass detentions. There is an unconnected Palestine solidarity march also taking place on Saturday.Defend Our Juries, a pressure group campaigning to lift the ban on Palestine Action under terrorism laws, said on Tuesday that more than 500 people had committed to holding up signs at its protest reading “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” as part of the protest.The group said the event would go ahead as planned after the “conditional commitment requirement” had been reached.Tim Crosland, a spokesperson for Defend Our Juries, defended plans to include Moazzam Begg, a former Guantánamo Bay detainee and director of the advocacy group Cage, in a press conference on Wednesday.Crosland said he could see why some people who supported the protest would have difficulty with a platform being shared with Cage, but added: “At this moment it feels it is so important to build relations with Muslim communities.”He said: “Moazzam has never been convicted of anything. I do personally have a lot of admiration for him. I think he went through horrific things in Guantánamo, as everyone in Guantánamo did.“He’s come out the other side such a strong advocate for justice and is able to put the terrorism laws in their wider perspective and speak to some of the damage they have done to communities.”Cage has suggested in the past that Mohammed Emwazi, believed to be the Islamic State killer known as “Jihadi John”, had been radicalised in part by Britain’s intelligence services.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The location of Saturday’s protest has not been made known.TheMetropolitan policemade clear they would arrest anyone breaking terrorism laws, as Downing Street urged people not to attend any protest.The demonstration has been organised to protest against the decision by the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, to ban the organisation last month after activists caused what police said was £7m of damage to jets at RAF Brize Norton.Police are also braced for further protests and disorder across the UK as anti-migrant demonstrations continue outside hotels housing asylum seekers. At least four protests have been organised for the next week in locations such as Bournemouth, Southampton and Portsmouth, with tensions rising further after clashes over the weekend.Far-right groups also plan to protest outside at least eight migrant hotels on Friday as part of a “no asylum day” of action.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “Capacity gold has been used for many months in the management of capacity pressure in the prison estate.

We pray for their safety.”The Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said rescue teams had been deployed “on a war footing”.mapA senior local official, Prashant Arya, said four people had been killed, with other officials saying that the number could rise.India’s army said 150 troops had reached the town, helping to rescue about 20 people who had survived the wall of freezing sludge. “A massive mudslide struck Dharali … triggering a sudden flow of debris and water through the settlement,” the army said.Images released by the army, taken from the site after the main torrent had passed, showed a river of slow-moving mud.A swathe of the town was swamped by deep debris. In places, the mud lapped at the rooftops of houses.“Search and rescue efforts are ongoing, with all available resources being deployed to locate and evacuate any remaining stranded persons,” an army spokesperson, Suneel Bartwal, said.The prime minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences, and said that “no stone is being left unturned in providing assistance”.Dhami said the flood was caused by a sudden and intense “cloudburst”, calling the destruction “extremely sad and distressing”.The India Meteorological Department issued a red alert warning for the area, saying it had recorded “extremely heavy” rainfall of about 21cm (8in) in isolated parts of Uttarakhand.Deadly floods and landslides are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say the climate crisis, coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and severity.The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said last year that more intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” for what is to come as climate breakdown makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherClimate crisisFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

I am so devastated,” he said.He said that Lee had gone to the concert with his brother and his brother’s children, and may have drunk alcohol but had not taken any drugs. Claydon said: “He doesn’t take drugs, he may have had a couple of beers but who hadn’t there? People have said horrible things but it was just an accident.”He added that he was concerned about the safety measures at Wembley. “All I know is there was beer everywhere, it’s slippery, he slipped apparently, we do not know the rest of it, there’s questions about the barriers.”Afundraising page, which has been set up to help raise money for Lee’s partner, Amanda, and son, Harry, has reached more than £7,000.Lee’s brother Aaron Claydon wrote on the page: “Our family has been turned upside down and are struggling to deal with this devastation and unexpected loss. Lee was a loving family man who was a role model to his son.”He described his brother as “the man I have always looked up to”. He added: “Lee would have done anything for any of us and he was taken from us far too soon, and we will miss him so very much.”A spokesperson for Wembley Stadium said: “Wembley Stadium operates to a very high health and safety standard, fully meeting legal requirements for the safety of spectators and staff, and is certified to and compliant with the ISO 45001 standard.“We work very closely and collaboratively with all relevant event delivery stakeholders – including event owners, local authorities, the Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the police – to deliver events to high standards of safety, security and service for everyone attending or working in the venue.”The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.The Metropolitan police are asking for anyone who witnessed the incident, or has mobile phone footage, to come forward.Oasis said in a statement on Sunday: “We are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic death of a fan at the show.Oasiswould like to extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of the person involved.”Explore more on these topicsOasisWembley stadiumLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She is the latest in a string foreign missionaries to become the victim of kidnapping in Haiti.Armed gangs have in recent years targeted a number of religious, charitable and medical aid groups, including hospitals, NGOs, nuns and priests from congregations based in and around the capital, as well as foreign missionaries.The majority of kidnapping victims are Haitian citizens who are seized and held for ransom, often picked opportunistically from the gridlocked traffic of the capital Port-au-Prince.More than 3,100 people were killed and 336 kidnapped for ransom in the first half of this year in Haiti, according to BINUH estimates, as the number of residents displaced by the extended conflict with the powerful gangs – largely grouped behind a coalition called Viv Ansanm, or “Live Together” – nearly doubled to 1.3 million.A recent report by the UN office inHaiti(BINUH) found the situation remained “very volatile” in Kenscoff while gangs intensified and expanded their attacks in central Haiti and the agricultural Artibonite region.BINUH considers Kenscoff of “major strategic importance” as it overlooks the suburb of Petion-Ville, one of the capital’s last hold-outs and the site of multiple embassies, banking institutions and hotels serving as diplomatic meeting places.‘Haitians are kidnapped every day’: missionary abductions shed light on growing crisisRead moreHaitian authorities have repeatedly called for more resources to fight the gangs.

News Corp also owns book publisher HarperCollins, which has published three of Trump’s books, though his best-known title, The Art of the Deal, was published by Random House.Still, the company appeared keen to warn Trump about the impact AI is having on publishing.“The AI age must cherish the value of intellectual property if we are collectively to realize our potential,” News Corp said in a statement with its fourth-quarter earnings report. “Even the president of the United States is not immune to blatant theft. The president’s books are still reporting healthy sales, but are being consumed by AI engines which profit from his thoughts by cannibalizing his concepts, thus undermining future sales of his books.“Suddenly, The Art of the Deal has become The Art of the Steal.”Media outlets have sued AI companies, including OpenAI, operator of ChatGPT, for using their content to train AI models without permission. In May, a federal judgerejectedOpenAI’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the New York Times over its usage of the newspaper’s content.

Trump claimed that the report was false and amounted to libel. The newspaper has requested a judge dismiss the case.Murdoch, who also owns Fox News, was once friendly with Trump, though relations soured during the president’s third presidential campaign.The company beat fourth-quarter expectations with Tuesday’s earnings announcement, largely due to a rise in digital subscriptions from Dow Jones, which houses the company’s business publications like the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s and MarketWatch.

Of those surveyed, 41% mentioned finding more plastic items (including plastic cups, bottle caps/lids, microplastics), including 19% more vapes, 26% more fishing litter (including lines/nets), 11% more dog poo bags and 11% more wet wipes.But there were some positive findings that demonstrated how good policy can make a difference. Volunteers on the beach cleans log every piece of litter they find so that a comprehensive dataset of rubbish on beaches can be built up and trends observed.Their research found that the number plastic bags littered on beaches reduced by 80% between 2015 and 2024, after a charge on carrier bags was introduced. The MCS says this shows that policy changes can quickly make a positive difference to the amount of pollution in the environment.Summer is a bad time for litter on UK beaches. Seventy-four per cent of MCS volunteers said they found an increase in beach litter during the summer, compared with winter months, due to increased visitor numbers plus a gap in public awareness around environmental impacts.Volunteers who take part in the litter pick have asked local authorities and governments in the UK to build better infrastructure including more accessible bins on beaches.Litter pickers said the problem was widespread and harming wildlife. Violet Fraser, who has been cleaning beaches on the Western Isles in Scotland, said she had found birds’ nests with plastic in, while Colette Edwards in Norfolk reported regularly finding seals caught in discarded nets on her local beach.Plastic is a particular scourge on beaches as it does not biodegrade, instead breaking down into microplastics that stay in the environment indefinitely, and these are easilyingested by marine animalsand can cause illness andeven death.A spokesperson for the MCS said: “The amount of plastic found on beaches increased by 9.5% between 2023 and 2024. The continued presence of plastics on our coastline highlights the need for a circular economy in which consumers have more options and access to use refillable and reusable products.“Beachwatch data has already been used by governments across the UK as evidence to introduce litter reducing policy – such as the carrier bag charges and bans on certain single-use plastics, such as straws, cutlery, plates and bowls, and the recent UK-wide commitment to ban plastic wet wipes.”Isaac Kenyon, a volunteer, said: “There’s something deeply grounding about standing on a shoreline and knowing that your small actions are part of something much bigger. Every piece of litter picked up is one less hazard for wildlife, one less piece of plastic in the ocean, and one small step toward a healthier planet.”TheGreat British Beach Cleanruns from 19-28 September.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionWastenewsShareReuse this content"

The northern and southern zones suffered the highest annual drops on record.Coral cover fell by 13% in the central section, which had escaped the worst of the heat in 2024.Dr Mike Emslie, who leads the long-term reef monitoring program at Aims, said coral cover was becoming more volatile. “It has been a pretty sobering year of surveys with the biggest impacts I have seen in the 30-plus years I have been doing this,” he said.“This volatility is very likely a sign of an unstable system. That’s our real concern. We’re starting to see record highs in coral cover that quickly get turned around to record falls.”Quick GuideWhat is coral bleaching?ShowCoral bleaching describes a process whereby the coral animal expels the algae that live in its tissues and give it its colour and much of its nutrients.Without its algae, a coral’s white skeleton can be seen through its translucent flesh, giving off a bleached appearance.Mass coral bleaching over large areas, first noticed in the 1980s around the Caribbean, is caused by rising ocean temperatures.Some corals also display fluorescent colours under stress when they release a pigment that filters light. Sunlight also plays a role in triggering bleaching.Corals can survive bleaching if temperatures are not too extreme or prolonged. But extreme marine heatwaves can kill corals outright.Coral bleaching can also have sub-lethal effects, including increased susceptibility to disease and reduced rates of growth and reproduction.Scientists say the gaps between bleaching events are becoming too short to allow reefs to recover.Coral reefs are considered one of the planet’s ecosystems most at risk from global heating. Reefs support fisheries that feed hundreds of millions of people, as well as supporting major tourism industries.The world’s biggest coral reef system – Australia’s Great Barrier Reef – has suffered seven mass bleaching events since 1998, of which five were in the past decade.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With relatively benign impacts from cyclones and bleaching in the five years before the 2024 event, coral cover had reached record levels in some places.But that recovery, Emslie said, was largely driven by fast-growingacroporacorals that were more susceptible to heat stress.“We had said it could all get turned around in one year and, low and behold, here we are,” he said, adding that coral cover was now mostly back in line with long-term averages.‘Closer and closer’The 2024 and 2025 events werepart of an ongoing global mass coral bleaching eventthat led to more than 80% of the planet’s reefs being hit with enough heat to cause bleaching, affecting corals in at least 82 countries and territories.A study last year foundocean temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef were probably at their hottest for at least 400 yearsand were an “existential threat” to the Unesco world heritage-listed reef.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are commonly called “forever chemicals” as these substances do not break down easily in the human body or nature, and are associated with certain cancers, hormonal dysfunction and other health problems.The payments announced on Monday, whose present value is about $500m before taxes, will start no earlier than 1 January 2026.Chemours will make half of the settlement payments, whileDuPontwill pay 35.5% and Corteva the rest, the companies said in a statement.In 2023, the three firms reached a settlement agreement with the US state of Ohio for $110m to resolve claims associated with Pfas.That same year, 3M agreed to pay $10.3bn to settle hundreds of claims that the company polluted public drinking water with the chemicals, while Chemours, DuPont and Corteva reached a similar deal with US water providers for $1.19bn.Of the total settlement announced on Monday, $16.5m is attributed to alleged Pfas contamination unrelated to the companies’ operating sites.Explore more on these topicsPfasNew JerseyDuPontnewsShareReuse this content"

The US under President Biden and now President Trump hasindicated it ismore supportive of a lower ambition treaty which does not include production cuts.View image in fullscreenProf Richard Thompson, the academic who coined the term ‘microplastics’, wants negotiators to act decisively.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianThe scale of plastic production and its threat to public health and the environment was underlined once more on Monday whena new reportwarned that the world is in a “plastics crisis” which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age and is responsible for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related damages.The huge acceleration of plastic production, which has increased by more than 200 times since 1950 and is expected to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060, has been fuelled largely by surges in the production of single-use plastics, the majority of which are usedfor packaging, drink and food containers.Thompson, head of theinternational marine litter research unitat Plymouth University, first identified and coined the phrase microplastics to describe how tiny bits of plastic accumulate in marine environments. Attending the Geneva talksas coordinator of the scientists coalitionfor an effective plastics treaty, he said an ambitious treaty would be a gamechanger for the planet and future generations.“It is now clear that plastic pollution contaminates our planet from the poles to the equator,” he said. “We find microplastics in our deepest oceans and our highest mountains. There is evidence of human exposure to them from the womb, throughout our entire lifetime.“It is really clear to protect future generations we need to take decisive action now on a treaty to address plastic pollution. So I really hope negotiators can look the next generation in the eye and say they acted decisively.”If agreed, a global plastics treaty would be an international, legally binding agreement designed to end plastic pollution by setting targets that nations would need to meet to try to end the 11m tonnes of plastic pollution that are dumped in the ocean every year.But since 2022, when the UNfirst secured an agreementfrom 173 countries to develop a legally binding treaty to cut plastic pollution, five separate negotiations have failed to secure a final text to sign.The initial agreementwas for a treaty to address the whole life cycle of plastics.But increasing numbers of plastics industry lobbyists have attended each round of talks to push back against production cuts.In Busan last year,220 fossil fuel and chemical industryrepresentatives – more plastic producers than ever – were represented, including 16 lobbyists from the plastics industry attending as part of country delegations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is really clear that business-as-usual is not sustainable.”Globally only 9% of plastic produced is recycled, and Thompson, whose work directly led to the ban onmicrobeads in cosmetic products in the UK, said the evidence showed that plastic production needed to be reduced to tackle plastic pollution.He said a treaty needed to ensure only plastic that was essential to society was produced, the thousands of chemicals used in plastic were reduced, and that all the plastic produced in future was sustainable, which involved moving to reuse and a circular economy in plastic.All of that, he said, would effectively reduce the amount of plastic produced globally.Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation to the treaty negotiations,said the science, the moral imperative and the economics were clear. “Uncontrolled plastic production is a death sentence. The only way to end plastic pollution is to stop making so much plastic.“World leaders must seize the opportunity in Geneva, stand up to the fossil fuel industry and take humanity’s first step towards ending the plastics crisis and create a healthier, safer future for all.”The Guardian’s climate assembly with George Monbiot and special guests.On 16 September 2025, join George Monbiot, Mikaela Loach and guests as they discuss the forces driving the big climate pushback, with a welcome from the Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, and an opportunity to meet our spotlight charities and activists.Book tickets here at Guardian Live.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsUnited NationsnewsShareReuse this content"

Inspired by the craze for Japanese fruit sandos, the M&S version went viral on social media, and the sandwich chain Subway then released its own version.Nutritional information for Tesco’s sandwich shows that it contains 515 calories with 8.4g saturated fat – 42% of an adult’s recommended daily intake. Despite being a “dessert sandwich”, it can be part of the Tesco meal deal for £4, alongside a drink and snack.Tesco’s brand manager, Violaine Barthe, said: “With 3.1million sandwiches sold in Tesco each year, sandwiches make up a big proportion of Clubcard purchases and so there was only one way to celebrate Clubcard turning 30.“The birthday cake sandwich is a celebration not to be missed and we can’t wait to hear the nation’s feedback.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I cannot get enough invitations to afternoon tea and I am even quite fond of a jam sandwich. But this is an abomination.At first glance, squashed against the plastic packaging, the sandwich looks like it is covered in specks of mould. On closer inspection, I realise these are blue sprinkles – they glisten slightly amid the fat of the soft cheese.There is a sickly sounding swishing noise as I bite into the bread. The sweetness of the jam tastes so odd combined with the gloopy cheese and cloys to my tongue, so that I continue to taste it long after I have swallowed.While the bread is reminiscent of brioche, it also tastes like – and resembles – the white bread I would expect to find in a packaged Tesco sandwich, especially the crust. With each bite, I am expecting to taste a savoury meal. Instead, I am confronted with a dessert.It reminds me of sickly homemade desserts I have forced myself to eat out of politeness. I wouldn’t even buy this to celebrate my worst enemy’s birthday.Explore more on these topicsTescoSandwichesFoodRetail industrySupermarketsnewsShareReuse this content"

The videos, which have drawn thousands of complaints on Reddit and X, mislead users into thinking they are receiving financial advice from a trusted source.Other viewers have reported false product claims, scam diet pills and fake competitions. In one Reddit thread users reported being targeted with ads impersonating UK media figures or pretending to offer government-backed grants, with little clarity over how to report or block such content.YouTube adverts fall under the sameAdvertisingStandards Authority (ASA) rules as TV, but unlike broadcasters, there is no pre-approval, real-time scrutiny or independent enforcement unless someone complains.The ASA has previously warned of a rise in “celebrity deepfake” and “impersonation” scams on online platforms, particularly for financial services. The lack of mandatory pre-approval or independent enforcement means that many of these adverts remain online for days before action is taken, if any is.Max Wilkinson, the Liberal Democrats’ spokesperson for culture, media and sport, said the system leaves the public exposed. “We cannot allow a two-tier system where traditional broadcasters face robust scrutiny, while a digital giant like YouTube is allowed to mark its own homework,” he said.The party is calling for YouTube advertising to be brought into line with the system used for TV and radio, including tougher oversight, clearer accountability, and the power for Ofcom to levy fines on platforms that repeatedly allow harmful or misleading ads. It also wants revenues from those fines used to support victims of online scams.YouTube ads are served through Google Ads and are regulated under a voluntary framework created by the tech industry. This contrasts with the ASA’s co-regulatory model for broadcast advertising, where Ofcom retains backstop powers and many adverts must be pre-cleared before airing.Privately, some Labour MPs acknowledge that online ad regulation is “behind the curve”, but there is little appetite for major change. Others have warned that new restrictions could make it harder to target voters aged under 35, many of whom are disengaged from traditional media.Last month the Guardianrevealed that Ofcom is preparing to push for new legal powersto require platforms like YouTube to give greater prominence to public service content, amid concerns that trusted news, children’s programming and UK-produced shows are becoming “invisible” to younger viewers.The Lib Dems argue that the same logic should apply to advertising, especially given the rise in misleading financial content and impersonation scams.“YouTube is no longer a niche platform – it’s one of the main ways people of all ages consume news, entertainment and information,” said Wilkinson. “The government needs to act now to ensure that consumers are properly protected.”A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube is not a broadcaster and it should not be regulated like one.“We have strict policies that govern the ads on our platform which we enforce rigorously. When we find ads that breach our policies we take immediate action, including removing the ads and suspending the account when necessary.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeAdvertisingLiberal DemocratsDeepfakeArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Now, its efforts will provide a blueprint for the new taxpayer-funded scheme, which will operate in parallel.“It’s not too late in the sense that there are people who can still be helped, there are many children,” Din said. But he added: “We should have done this much sooner.”The UK’s decision to offer itself as a receiving state comes as starvation and famine from Israel’s aid blockade take hold in Gaza, where more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October. The WorldHealthOrganization (WHO) has estimated as many as 12,500 patients in Gaza require medical evacuation, and humanitarian organisations have called on more countries to assist.chartLast month, a charity launched legal action againstthe government’s decision not to provide medical evacuationsagainst historical precedent, and ministers faced increased pressure from more than 100 MPs to act.Charities hope that about 100 children on their existing lists will be permitted to come to the UK, along with a guardian and possibly siblings. PPH has told the government it has between 30 and 50 children who should come to the UK, and the charityChildrenNot Numbers (CNN) has 60 children in critical need of medical evacuation from Gaza.Charities said there were many people – working in healthcare and other sectors – who were willing to donate their time and money to help. “We have a thriving private healthcare system in addition to our NHS system, and combined with the government behind them, I think services can be expanded to support a greater number of children,” said Din.Looking to counterparts in Europe and the US, and the neighbouring countries Egypt, Qatar and the UAE, which had evacuated more than7,000 patients as of April, according to the WHO, Din said the UK government should assist children “relative to our counterparts”.One child the charity was assisting had fourth-degree burns to 40% of his body. However, discussions with the government over bringing the child to the UK moved too slowly, the charity said, and the child ended up being taken to Italy in June, along with a one-year-old boy with a congenital disease. The charity has also assisted medical evacuations to the UAE and Jordan.“We’ve now developed a blueprint, we’ve got all the resources [and] learning. The whole pathway is there now for you to take and use the full force of government to scale [up] urgently,” said Din.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Welcoming the government’s announcement, a spokesperson said 71 children they were assisting had died due to insufficient treatment, medicine and delays to medical evacuations, since they first called on the prime minister to consider such a scheme in November last year.“This is absolutely disheartening,” said a CNN spokesperson. “We had to wait around 10 months for it to happen.”The charity said the 60 children it had in critical need of evacuation had their paperwork and medical records ready for final review from Israel’s coordinator of government activities in the territories (Cogat). Médecins Sans Frontières has previously called on the Israeli government to allow more patients to leave Gaza, and be more flexible, saying cases faced a lot of Cogat rejections.“We are ready to go as long as we have the green light from the government,” said the CNN spokesperson.A Foreign Office spokesperson said a cross-government taskforce had been created to pull the new scheme together as quickly as possible.“We are taking forward plans to evacuate more children from Gaza who require urgent medical care, including bringing them to the UK for specialist treatment where that is the best option for their care,” they said.Explore more on these topicsGazaForeign policyIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The prices are not inclusive of VAT.The LIF describes itself on its website as “a thinktank focused on getting Britain building and growing again”. It states that it wants to “spark dialogue” between the party and “those working across the infrastructure sector”.The thinktank was launched in September last year at an event with speeches from Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, and Varun Chandra, a business adviser to Keir Starmer.It is not part of the Labour party and is not a lobbying company, which means it does not need to abide by the rules or guidance for lobbying firms or political parties.A spokesperson for the LIF told the Times that the group used sponsorship money to cover its costs and that “any LIF activity that is supported by sponsors will be made publicly available at the time and in our annual report, as is common across the industry”.

The party fully complies with all rules relating to the reporting of donations,” a party spokesperson said.The LIF states that its secretariat and work is supported by the lobbying company Bradshaw Advisory. The Times reported that a client of Bradshaw Advisory had been able to have a meeting last year with Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, at the Labour party conference, which has not been declared on transparency records.A Labour party spokesperson said: “This was a meeting at party conference that was held in a political capacity. All meetings held in a ministerial capacity are declared in the proper way in full accordance with the rules.”Labourcame under fire last autumnfor offering company bosses breakfast with Reynolds for up to £30,000. For £15,000 plus VAT, companies were told they would get an opportunity to give a keynote speech, photographs with the business secretary and others, and a dedicated member of Labour party staff to help make introductions. For £30,000 they would also get to help decide who would attend.In the pitch, Labour’s commercial team called the offer a “unique opportunity to become a commercial partner at our business policy roundtable over breakfast”. The event ultimately did not go ahead and the party said Reynolds had been unaware of it.The Guardian reportedlast month that some Labour MPs were alarmed at the number of sponsored corporate receptions for backbenchers that have been arranged by the party, amid concerns about perceived conflicts of interest.MPs said they had received invitations for networking receptions that include explicit advertisements for property developers or public affairs firms, sent directly from the parliamentary Labour party office.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsLabourThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content"

It specifically references Paramount’s decision to pay Trump $16m to settle a “meritless lawsuit” about a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris. The letter notes that Trump “retaliated against publications reporting factually on the White House and threatened broadcasters’ licenses”, and has repeatedly called for the cancellation of programs that criticize him.Stephen Colbert: ‘What you thought you knew is just history’Read moreAdditionally, the letter blasts Republicans in Congress who “collaborated” with theTrump administrationto defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting “in order to silence PBS and NPR”. And it says the FCC, led by Trump-appointed chair Brendan Carr, “openly conditioned its approval of the Skydance-Paramount merger on assurances that CBS would make ‘significant changes’ to the purported ideological viewpoint of its journalism and entertainment programming.“These are un-American attempts to restrict the kinds of stories and jokes that may be told, to silence criticism and dissent,” the letter reads. “We don’t have a king, we have a president. And the president doesn’t get to pick what’s on television, in movie theaters, on stage, on our bookshelves, or in the news.”Signees include Tony Gilroy, David Simon, Mike Schur, Ilana Glazer, Lilly Wachowski, Celine Song, Justin Kuritzkes, Desus Nice, Gillian Flynn, John Waters, Liz Meriwether, Kenneth Lonergan, Alfonso Cuarón, Shawn Ryan and many other prominent names in film and television.The letter, released on Tuesday, calls on elected representatives and industry leaders to “resist this overreach”, as well as their audiences to “fight for a free and democratic future” and “raise their voice”.‘Authoritarian and un-American’: celebrities outraged by Trump’s response to LA Ice protestsRead moreThe Corporation for Public Broadcastingannouncedlast Friday that it would shut down after 57 years in operation, following the decision by the Republican-controlled House last month to eliminate $1.1bn in CPB funding over two years, part of a $9bn reduction to public media and foreign aid programs.The corporation, established by Congress in 1967 to ensure educational and cultural programming remained accessible to all Americans, distributed more than $500m annually to PBS, NPR and 1,500 local stations nationwide. Despite the federal grants, stations mostly relied on viewer donations, corporate sponsorships and local government funds to stay afloat.TheTrump administrationhas also filed a lawsuit against three CPB board members who refused to leave their positions after Trump attempted to remove them.“This is certainly not the first time that free speech has come under assault in this country, but free speech remains our right because generation after generation of Americans have dedicated themselves to its protection,” the letter concludes. “Now and always, when writers come under attack, our collective power as a union allows us to fight back. This period in American life will not last forever, and when it’s over the world will remember who had the courage to speak out.”Explore more on these topicsSpike LeeAdam McKayDonald TrumpTrump administrationRepublicansUS CongressUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

OpenAI has used the term “open weight”, in effect a notch down from open source, which means the model can still be fine-tuned – but its workings are not fully transparent to the developer.OpenAI’s announcement came amid speculation that a new version of the model that underpins ChatGPT could be released soon. On Sunday Altmanshared a screenshotof what appeared to be the company’s latest AI model, GPT-5.Meanwhile, Google hasoutlined its latest step towards artificial general intelligence(AGI) with a new model that allows AI systems to interact with a convincing simulation of the real world.The Genie 3 “world model” could be used to train robots and autonomous vehicles as they engage with realistic recreations of environments such as warehouses, according toGoogle.Its AI division,Google DeepMind, argues that world models are a key step to achieving AGI, a hypothetical level of AI where a system can carry out most tasks on a par with humans – rather than just individual tasks such as playing chess or translating languages – and potentially do someone’s job.DeepMind said such models would play an important role in the development of AI agents, orsystems that carry out tasks autonomously.“We expect this technology to play a critical role as we push toward AGI, and agents play a greater role in the world,”DeepMindsaid.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpenAIMetaGoogleAlphabetMark ZuckerbergSam AltmannewsShareReuse this content"

The ensuing search captured headlines around the world for days as it evolved from a potentialrescue mission to a recovery operation.US Coast Guard investigatorsreleased their final reporton Tuesday. It spans more than 300 pages after a two-year investigation. What emerged was a scathing portrait of the company operating the Titan, OceanGate, and its chief executive, Stockton Rush, who was among those who died.Based on hearings involving more than two dozen people, including former employees, the report paints a picture of OceanGate as a company where employees were threatened with dismissal and belittled for raising concerns about safety. The result was a culture of downplaying, ignoring and even falsifying vital safety information to improve its reputation and evade scrutiny from regulators.“OceanGate’s toxic safety culture, corporate structure, and operational practices were critically flawed and at the core of these failures were glaring disparities between their written safety protocols and their actual practices,” the report said. “For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company’s favourable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny.”Investigators found the Titan’s design, certification, maintenance and inspection process were all inadequate.“This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,” said Jason Neubauer, the chair of the Coast Guard’s Marine Board of Investigation,in a statement.Employees told investigators Rush would often bypass established protocols and ignore the concerns of experienced employees and contractors.“The cumulative effect was an authoritarian and toxic culture where safety was not only deprioritised but actively suppressed,” the report said. “This toxic environment, characterised by retaliation and belittling against those who expressed safety concerns combined with a lack of external oversight, set the stage for the Titan’s ultimate demise.”The report cited mounting financial pressures in 2023 as being behind a decision made by OceanGate to store the Titan submersible outdoors over the Canadian winter. “During this time, the submersible was not covered or protected from the environmental elements, subjecting it to precipitation and repeated freeze-thaw cycles,” it said, likely leading to further degradation of the hull’s structural integrity.Investigators concluded Rush had “exhibited negligence” that contributed to the deaths of four people. Had Rush survived, the case would have likely ended up at the US Department of Justice and he might have been subjected to criminal charges, the report noted.In addition to Rush, the implosion killed the French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, the British adventurer Hamish Harding and the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman.OceanGate wound down operations and focused its resources on cooperating with investigators, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday. In a statement, he added: “We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on 18 June 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy.”OceanGate began ferrying dozens of paying customers and researchers to thesite scattered with debris from the Titanic in 2021, characterising the voyages as part of an ambitious push to foster deep-sea tourism.Last year, the family of Nargeoletfiled a wrongful death lawsuitseeking more than $50m amid accusations that the “doomed submersible” had a “troubled history” and that OceanGate had failed to disclose crucial facts about the vessel and its durability.Neubauer was optimistic that the investigation would help to prevent future tragedies. “There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework,” he said.That view was echoed by the Dawood family. “No report can alter the heartbreaking outcome, nor fill the immeasurable void left by two cherished members of our family,” they said in a statement. “We believe that accountability and regulatory change must follow such a catastrophic failure.”The hope was that the tragedy would be a turning point for the submersible industry, the family added. “If Shahzada and Suleman’s legacy can be a catalyst for regulatory change that helps prevent such a loss from ever happening again, it will bring us some measure of peace.”Explore more on these topicsTitanic sub incidentAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He discusses shame, typecasting and how he appeared in three Harry Potter films without ever saying a lineTue 5 Aug 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 05.27 EDTShareHow do you portray Galactus, a gigantic, amoral, immortal superbeing who thrives by draining planets of their energy? If you’re making a film of any part of Marvel’sFantastic Fourjourney, your best bet is probably to depict him as a cloud. That’s what happened in 2007, and even though fans complained about it a bit, it solved a lot of problems.Matt Shakman, director of the newThe Fantastic Four: First Steps, cast Ralph Ineson, who still sounds faintly surprised by the move. “I’ve been working for a long time,” he says. His first role was a small part in Spender, the Jimmy Nail vehicle, in 1991, and he’s in a similar mould to Nail: tall with a handsome, rough-hewn face, a guy who looks as if he knows how to do guy stuff.“I’ve been a jobbing actor for a long time,” he continues, with the same disbelieving, “how the hell did I wind up in this huge movie?” tone of voice. “There’s no denying it’s really nice to have a huge trailer. And it was huge. Bigger than mine and my wife’s first flat.” (He married Ali Milner, a radio host, in 2003.) “Nice trailers, nice cars, and a paycheck. But it’s a privilege and an honour to be the first person to bring this character to life. Twelve-year-old me wouldn’t have believed some of this shit. I don’t have any snobbery about it. I loved it.”Then Ineson describes what it took to make this character, in terms I could already hear, after five minutes, were extremely true to form: stressing the industry and professionalism of everyone on set (including the two people whose job it was to blow cold air into each of his gauntlets between takes) except himself, the dude who just has to show up and try not to sweat. “They had to shoot me on a white background, with lots of bright light, and I’m wearing this enormous costume, so it was incredibly hot and there was nowhere for the heat to escape. Obviously, Galactus can’t sweat. So I had a Formula One pit crew of people around me.”View image in fullscreen‘I remember being terrified’ ... Ineson, back right, in The Office.Photograph: BBC/Jack BarnesIt sounds like a nightmare, I suggest. “For me, there’s something quite masochistic about acting. Sometimes you only really get the good stuff when you’re at the edge of something, either mentally, emotionally or physically. It unlocks stuff.” And then, mindful that he has skated way closer to pretension than he’d prefer, “Occasionally I had to have the physio at my knees, because I’m 55 and falling apart.” His calling, as an actor, has been playing one bad guy after another, but he is one of the most personable people you could ever meet.Ineson grew up in Leeds in the 1970s, when he “felt as if acting was something that was almost shameful, or maybe that’s too strong a word. But it wasn’t really something to be proud of, when I was a kid.” His parents were supportive in the sense that they would never miss a show, but nobody thought it was a serious career prospect, and after doing theatre studies at Furness college in Lancaster, he worked as a drama teacher at a sixth-form college in York.He got involved with the York Mystery Plays – a tradition that’s been going, on and off, since the mid-14th century: a Bible story told every year, once performed on a roaming cart, then, by the time Ineson did it in 1992, at the York Theatre Royal. All the characters were played by the people of York, except for one professional actor, who that year was Robson Green.View image in fullscreen‘I thought: “This is exactly what I have always wanted to do”’ … Ineson, centre, in the The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.Photograph: Netflix/Kobal/Shutterstock“He was pretty lonely on his own, sat in his hotel. We’d go out for a drink and I ended up sharing a dressing room with him. And he said: ‘You’re not wedded to being a teacher, are you?’ I wasn’t, although I did enjoy it, but I hadn’t been to drama school, I wasn’t classically trained. He said: ‘Go home and watch TV tonight, look at the characters you could play.’ So I watched a soap, I watched the nine o’clock drama, and there were about five people I thought I could play.”He describes the next phase as a series of lucky strikes: meeting an agent through Green and getting the part in Spender, “basically because I could ride off-road motorbikes – the character was a professional motocross rider”. Then another agent, more parts, but still “I don’t think I realised I wanted to be an actor until I’d been doing it for 20 years,” he says. “Shoots were something I really enjoyed, but almost pretended I didn’t. Then, I was sitting on a horse on the plains outside Santa Fe, dressed as the man in black, a posse leader” – that was The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, a Coen brothers film. “And I thought: ‘This is exactly what I have always wanted to do.’ I just didn’t realise it until I was in my mid-40s.” But that was 2018, and quite a lot had happened in the years before that.If you feel as if you know Ineson personally, it will be because of The Office, in 2001, where he occasionally breezed in as Finchy, the boorish sales rep whom Ricky Gervais’s David Brent hero-worshipped all the more for his proudly offensive humour. Ineson was sent the pilot episode on VHS, “which is how long ago it was. I remember being really terrified. How brilliant they were, the central four, firing off each other. I was slightly intimidated. My first thought was: ‘Shit, can I do this?’”View image in fullscreenHypnotising horror … The Witch.Photograph: Parts And Labor/Rt Features/Rooks Nest/Upi/Kobal/ShutterstockWhen he first started out, he often felt as if he was on the back foot because he hadn’t been to drama school. “I don’t know whether I would have suited it, but it felt like a big thing for the first few years, because that is all young actors talk about.” Slowly, he came to have more regard for his own idiosyncratic apprenticeship: “For years I’ve had the chance to work on big productions without a lot of responsibility – mainly getting my horse to stand in the right place, being in that part of the screen, behind the main villain’s left shoulder. You learn a lot about acting, doing that.”Anyway, feeling that he had to be on his mettle – which was fair, Gervais, Mackenzie Crook, Martin Freeman and Lucy Davis were explosively good together – he made a fateful decision. “I thought: ‘I’ll use my own accent, I’ll play Finchy as a Yorkshireman so I don’t have to think about anything except keeping up with the rest of them.’ That was a big mistake, because it meant that everybody, for at least 10 years, thought that IwasFinchy. That I wasn’t acting; that was just my personality. So having people thinking you’re Chris Finch, looking at you with amusement, but also a bit of disgust, a bit of fear. He’s just such a shitter. It’s not a nice skin!” It didn’t end with regular human interactions, either – “career-wise, it was a bit of pain. I just got offered wankers, racists, misogynists and homophobes.”Before The Office, he was always having to recount his CV for people in the street – they’d come up and go, “what have I seen you in?”, and he’d have to size them up and figure out whether they remembered him from Goodnight Sweetheart or an episode of The Bill. He remembers thinking it would be nice to have something so major that nobody would have to ask. “Be careful what you wish for, because then I got Finchy and I couldn’t get rid of him for about 20 years. At least Galactus simply exists, he’s a cosmic force. He doesn’t do it out of malice. You can’t really get much worse than Chris Finch.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s a privilege’ … The Northman.Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/AlamyHe remains a big fan of The Office, which I smoke out by getting him to adjudicate between the British and American versions – he didn’t watch the US one for ages, because he caught snatches of it and thought: “No, they’re doing it wrong.” Five years ago, his daughter watched the whole thing and he realised, “it’s different, but it is good. Because I have a slightly twisted sense of humour, I prefer the British Office, it’s darker. You would actually let Michael Scott [Gervais’s US counterpart, played by Steve Carell] look after your 18-year-old daughter, whereas I’m not sure you’d let Ricky Gervais’s character look after your 18-year-old daughter. Same with my character, he’s a lot darker than Todd Packer, the American version. Whether that makes it better or worse, I don’t know. It’s nastier underneath, which I kind of like.”The late 00s were taken up at least partly with the Harry Potter movies, in which he played the dark wizard Amycus Carrow. His son was 10 and his daughter was six when he shot Half-Blood Prince in 2008. It was the perfect age, you get the impression he’d have done it just so they could meet Daniel Radcliffe. He also got to hang out with Michael Gambon for days on end. “He’s the best storyteller in the world, ever. Joke-teller, raconteur, everything. He told me this joke that lasted a whole week; I could tell it in 15 seconds. It was one of the best weeks of my life.”Nevertheless, he had no lines at all, “a supporting artist, basically”. The producers enticed him in with the next two books, in which there’s more meat on Carrow’s bones. But when they came to make the astronomically long Deathly Hallows, parts one and two, the plot had been very slightly tweaked to remove the pivotal moment when his character spits in Professor McGonagall’s face and unleashes hell. “I did three Harry Potter films without saying a single line.”View image in fullscreen‘Twelve-year-old me wouldn’t have believed it’ ... Ineson, back left, with his Fantastic Four castmates.Photograph: Alberto E Rodríguez/Getty Images for DisneyAs the father in The Witch, Robert Eggers’s acclaimed, hypnotising horror movie, which won lots of indie film awards, including best director for Eggers at Sundance, Ineson felt that he’d got the first part with its own arc. This was 2015, when he was in his mid-40s, realising he actually was an actor, perhaps relatedly, at around the time the industry realised how good he was. He speaks so highly of his co-star, Kate Dickie – “she should be a dame, she’s that good,” he crescendoes a little surprisingly. But his collaboration with Eggers was intense. Ineson sat at the director’s shoulder while the other actors were cast. “It was a weird experience – it felt terribly unfaithful, as if I was cheating on my profession.” They worked together again on The Northman in 2022, which had a broader canvas visually and emotionally, but had the same feeling of The Witch, a film that had an immense amount of knowledge go into it, only a fraction of which you could pin down. “I have got no idea how Rob has managed to read so much in his lifetime, it feels as if he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of almost every period in history.”If Ineson was never prepared, post-Office, to give in to being typecast as a wanker, he’s pretty comfortable with being a supervillain. “I think with my size, face and voice, 90% of the time I’ve been on the bad guy side of the line anyway. I would be fighting a losing battle if I was trying to get myself into romcoms. Some things are beyond the realms of casting.” If The Fantastic Four: First Steps is a turning point, the difference is mainly one of scale. “Although I’ve been involved with big films before, I’ve never played a character that is this important to the film and the franchise,” he says, with an amount of trepidation. It’s true – there are other people in the movie (Pedro Pascal! Vanessa Kirby!), but if the villain doesn’t work, nothing does. “So if it doesn’t make a profit, it’s my fault? Is that what you’re saying?”, he says, mock petrified. The film is already doing fine at the box office. He should relax.Explore more on these topicsFilmTelevisionMarvelRicky GervaisFilm industryFantastic FourfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But years later, when she went back over all the photographs she’d taken during that period, things looked rather different. “I’ve got tons of photos of airport lounges and long stretches of road in Europe,” she says with a shake of the head. “Lots of German service stations. Nothing of the band! No backstage fun, no frolics!”Jackson may regret not capturing more of the band’sshort but spectacular heyday, but the road has always been important to her. As a Pulp-obsessed teenager in Bury St Edmunds, she would gaze out of the kitchen window and dream of escaping small town life via the A14. The Long Blondes track Separated By Motorways told the story of two girls doing a runner down that exact road (“​​Wipe your eyes darling, it’s OK / Meet me on the dual carriageway”). And over the last decade or so, roads have become a central feature of her second career in visual art.Nobody really takes any notice of them – you're always whizzing byUsing bold, pop art-inspired colours and sharp geometrical lines, Jackson’s paintings transform parts of our unloved motorway network into dazzling scenes of romance and possibility. ThinkEd Ruscha’s gas stationspropelled along by the motorik beat ofKraftwerk’s Autobahn. The service station at Leicester Forest East has never looked more beautiful.View image in fullscreen‘It changed everything’ … Jackson on the DRAW! project.Photograph: courtesy of the artistJackson lists Andy Warhol, Australian surrealistJeffrey Smartand printmaker Paul Catherall as influences – but also the lyrics of Jarvis Cocker. “I love how he could write about the interior of a bedroom and make it seem like the most exotic, romantic place in the world,” she says. “I try to do the same thing with my paintings of flyovers and bridges. Nobody really takes any notice of them. You’re always whizzing by. But there’s always a moment when the light catches them in a particular way and makes them seem incredibly beautiful.”This month, Jackson has been selected to pick the theme forDRAW!, a nationwide drawing project backed by David Hockney that is part of Bradford 2025 UK City of Culture. She has chosen “landscape”, andwill be on social mediaencouraging people of all ages to pick up a pen or pencil or iPad and sketch something fitting. The project’s aim is to get people to pause and reflect on their surroundings, and it’s already having an impact – on Jackson herself.“It’s funny,” she says. “You spend years trying to develop your own style, to make your work recognisable. But then you get stuck in that style. You stop experimenting and you stop being playful. And art is all about experimentation and being playful. So this has made me go back to my sketchbooks and try different things.”Jackson is actually creating a new body of work as we speak, saying she’s “completely changed everything” as a result of DRAW! “I’m using a celestial astrological wheel, drawing the symbols that represent the star signs and bringing some animals in.”Giddy Stratospheres, a 2004 single by Jackson’s former band the Long Blondes.She has drawn and painted since she was young, sketching boats on the harbour with her “very talented” artist mother. She would have completed a fine art degree in Sheffield had the Long Blondes not taken off during her final year – even then, she carried on making art for their record sleeves. In fact, she thinks a painting of Diana Dors made in her student bedroom may have helped the band crystalise their aesthetic: a mixture of retro glamour, film and literary references, and spiky guitars.With her neck scarf and beret, Jackson added some much-needed style and intellect to the era’s male-dominated indie scene. The band earned a devoted fanbase and wrote one of the defining anthems of the 2000s: the disco-punk singleGiddy Stratospheres. But after two albums, guitarist and songwriter Dorian Cox had a stroke and was left unable to play the guitar. The band called it a day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that record’s painful gestation convinced her to redirect her attention towards painting. She spent four years refining her style in Rome, and has developed an eye for brutalist landmarks as well as all the motorways and bridges. More recently, though, she has caught the music bug again. During lockdown, and with her then two-year-old son asleep next to her, she found herself messing around with Logic on her iPad and began pushing herself to compose electronic music. Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware was impressed with the results and offered to produce them, and a Terry Farley remix of her track Don’t Doubt Your Power (recorded under the name Corselette) will hit clubs later this year.‘It’s all just very grimy and filthy’: Gregory Nolan’s photos of the 00s indie sceneRead moreIt took a while before Jackson could look back fondly on the Long Blondes’ time in the spotlight. “We didn’t make Kaiser Chiefs money,” she says with a wry smile. “But I think [debut album]Someone to Drive You Homestill stands the test of time.” And despite the lack of photographic evidence, Jackson knows she had a lot of fun too. “Oh definitely,” she says. “In terms of getting to be in a band, that whole period was really the last hurrah.”DRAW! a Landscape with Kate Jackson atbradford2025.co.ukExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtIndieUK city of cultureBradfordRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s right: worse than A Thousand Words, the Liar Liar ripoff so underwhelming that Murphy had to take a break from making comedies. And worse than Norbit, the Nutty Professor ersatz probably costing him the Oscar for Dreamgirls. At least in those comedy clunkers, Murphy came to play. He made clear either through advanced prosthetics or through sheer force of personality that he could deliver a satisfying performance no matter the premise – or, better still: elevate hackneyed material. But in this straight-to-Prime Video snoozefest Murphy struggles to hide his age and boredom while looking for all the world like a hostage in his own heist flick.The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreIt takes work to make Murphy entirely unfunny, and this film manages the job one-handed. It surrounds him with a playful cast: Eva Longoria, a true all-rounder; Pete Davidson, the SNL stitch-up; and Keke Palmer, maybethe funniest woman of her generation. But then it delivers them a script written by two guys – Kevin Burrows and Matt Mider – best known for a web series about anthropomorphic lobsters. It all comes together in 90 of the longest minutes you’ll ever spend in front of a screen, provided you even make it that far.At this late career stage, Murphy is at his best when leaning into nostalgia – whether replaying the hits (Coming 2 America, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F) or indulging his inner child (Dolemite Is My Name, Candy Cane Lane). But The Pickup doesn’t even get that right. Instead it has Murphy playing Russell, an armored messenger counting down the days until retirement in a set-up seemingly ripped from the first Lethal Weapon.Then there’s Davidson as Travis, the doofus partner who nearly shot up a bank after misreading a random come-on as a robbery attempt. And while his instincts weren’t completely off – his seducer, Zoe (Palmer), winds up stripping him of privileged security information – they do ultimately leave him and Russell vulnerable to a hijacking while making rounds in their armored truck. Naturally, that sets up phase 2 of the plan – an overwrought copy-paste of Oceans 11. At one point Zoe chalks up her heist plans as just another big score in our otherwise compromised capitalist system. But that line isn’t as eye-roll inducing as the implication of romantic chemistry between Zoe and Travis, which the film is at pains to hammer home with a nod to Davidson’srumored BDE.To watch Murphy throw drop-kicks, launch dye packs and otherwise fend off robbers is to be reminded of Murphy’s increasing reluctance to perform his own stunts at age 64. During the press run for Axel F, he joked about rebuffing director Mark Molloy’s call to run down a set of stepswith greater urgency. “Don’t call me unless you’re offering me the same type of shit you would offer Morgan Freeman,” he cracked.In fact, the film’s action sequences overall beggar belief. Longoria pops up in the middle of the action like Taraji P Henson at the end of Acrimony. Russell ejects one of Zoe’s henchmen from his speeding armored truck on to another car trailing just behind; he crashes back-first on to the hood, caroms on to the highway and somehow lives to fight another day. Worse, bullets fly all over the place – and yet the only one that really lands winds up taking out the chop shop owner played by Marshawn Lynch, a football legend with a pronounced history ofrepelling unwelcome aggression.Oh, and they had the nerve to name Lynch’s character Chop Shop without nodding at that absurdity. They didn’t give him any funny lines or make much effort to punch up the truck depot manager portrayed by Andrew Dice Clay – you know, the comedy legend who played to a sold-out Madison Square Garden crowd not long after Murphy set the standard. The waste of comedic talent here borders on criminal, but not as severe as commissioning Ruth Carter to render the pedestrian costumes. All of it will leave you wondering if director Tim Story, the same comedy boffin who gave the world Barbershop, Ride Along andThe Blackening– had this picture hijacked out from under him. Or maybe he was just keen to show how many cars he could blow up in one frame?Early on in the film, as the buddy cops settle into the getting-to-know-you stage, Russell shares his gauzy plan to open a bed and breakfast upon retiring, and Travis balks at the career shift. Technically, he tells Russell: “Your generation can’t pivot,” but it feels like he’s speaking directly to Murphy – who should’ve known better than to pick up a full-on action comedy script at his big age. This film isn’t likely to do significant long-term damage to his beloved reputation, not with his turn as Inspector Clouseaucoming down the pike. But those who do brave his heist flick won’t soon forget the time they were taken prisoner, too.The Pickup is out onAmazon Prime Videoon 6 AugustExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsEddie MurphyComedyAction and adventure filmsAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

Bad though that is, it’s not the worst example in this lucidly laid out and often harrowing indictment of social media’s ruthlessness; that would be the proliferation of drug dealers on Snapchat, which the company seems to have to some extent turned a blind eye to in the scramble to expand its user base.Based on the investigative work of Bloomberg journalist Olivia Carville, this film covers the attempts ofminnow legal outfit Social Media Victims Law Centerto net the sharks of Silicon Valley. It represents a host of families who have suffered heartbreaking losses due to unpoliced extreme online content: children and teenagers who fatally copied auto-asphyxiation or pro-suicide videos, ones who killed themselves after falling victim to sextortionists, or who overdosed after buying off-prescription meds from predatory dealers. The battle here is to overcome section 230, a get-out clause in the 1996 Telecommunication Act that gives social media companies immunity for third-party-generated content. Of course, Mark Zuckerberg was still slurping Slush Puppies back then.Matthew Bergman, the center’s founder, twice makes the analogy with cigarette companies, arguing that social media companies knowingly prioritise profit over the health of their users. If the film is clear about this causation and the resulting damage, it is not a given that the team can make a longer leap: from establishing a degree of culpability in individual cases and getting justice and closure for these families, to proving that the tech companies systematically predicate their algorithms on fanning our most negative tendencies and impulses. The big victory here is stopping theSnapchatcase being dismissed due to section 230; more of a minor triumph that shows the scale of the mountain, but you have to start somewhere.

A man stands up in the audience and says, “Is thishonest?Are we all beinghonesthere?” He points at Sasha and adds, “You especially.” Soon a video of the episode appears online, with a companion clip of Sasha’s vitriolic reaction: “Some random fucking nobody … some dick-weed, small-town TonyInterruptor.”Given the times we live in, this naturally leads to Sasha’s trial by social media for artistic fraudulence and abusive conduct. But the shockwaves soon extend to everyone adjacent to the event: Fi Kinebuchi, the self-styled “Queen of Strings”, who was playing with Sasha at the time; India Shore, the teenager who posted the first video; India’s father, Lambert, an architecture professor with a secret crush on Fi Kinebuchi; his wife Mallory, who divides her time between parenting her daughter, Gunn, who has special needs, and venting intellectual spleen; and even to TonyInterruptor himself, real name John Lincoln Braithwaite, an otherworldly outsider whose “main occupation – his duty, even – is to observe and assess the falling and the catching of light”.The author of more than a dozen books, including the Goldsmiths prize winner H(a)ppy and the Booker‑shortlisted Darkmans, Barker is known for experiment and brainy whimsy. There could be no better person to write a comedy about art and its discontents. The novel is devastatingly on the money about the ways we’re all not being honest here: whether as flawed, self-conscious humans, or in the special case of artists, who strive harder for honesty and thus fall harder into affectation. Even the unworldly Braithwaite isn’t immune. What are we to make of a man who smokes because “smoking is a condensed and bastardised form of fire-watching”, and when asked to shake hands responds with, “I object to handshaking on ideological grounds … but you seem well-meaning so I’m happy to respond in the vernacular you’re most comfortable with.” Sincerity here is just the youthful illusion that we’re exempt from universal impostordom; or the lovely illusion of lovers that their inamorata is the one in a million who is reallyreal.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionTonyInterruptor that rare thing, a serious work of art that is also a giddy confectionThe characters’ sensitivity to the falseness all around them – and in them – gives them no peace. Lambert describes his wife, Mallory, as relentless in her criticisms, “like a seagull up to its knees in sea-swell, determinedly dissecting a crustacean as it rolls ceaselessly back and forth”. But this is true in various ways of all the characters, who are always finding fault. Sometimes this means railing at others, as when India tells her dad to “stop always making everything so … so INTELLECTUAL, so META … and just … just … for once in your life risk beingreal”. Sometimes they bemoan their own artificiality, as when Lambert conceives of himself as being “like a Moneymaker tomato: ripened to an unnaturally bright hue on a constant drip-diet of Baby Bio”.The prose is a profusion of thoughts and associations, and shadings of the thoughts, and metaphors extending from the associations. All this is delivered in long, manic sentences that love to chase their own tails. When we’re told Braithwaite is “like a leading character in a bad 1980s American capitalist drama (say Dallas: the over-indulged younger brother, the prodigal son who returns to the oilfield and promises his tough yet paradoxically indulgent slate-eyed, tan-faced father that he will learn the trade from the ground up; prove himself). But also like a character from an excellent, slightly clunky but extremely sincere first play about a demoralised primary school teacher who is struggling to nurture a gifted but troubled Irish Traveller child written by a 23-year-old northern prodigy whose uncle once ran (and possibly still runs) an abbatoir” –well, are we really expected to parse all that? I suspect not. The excess is the joke, and the joke is sometimes on the reader who struggles to get anything as sensible as an image out of Barker’s imagery. It’s a rollercoaster kind of excess, where the best part is that it’s too much. Sometimes, I think, we’re being invited to enjoy the slapstick experience of losing our footing mid-sentence, and to join the laugh if we fall flat.Midway, the book takes a turn into romantic comedy, with a series of scenes where unlikely characters fall for each other. The honesty they’ve been pursuing, it turns out, consists not in improvised jazz, but in becoming besotted with an inappropriate person and blowing up your life. Barker manages this shift with an extraordinary lightness and perceptiveness, making it feel as though the rogue wave of love sweeping through her narrative was inevitable as soon as the words “Are we all being honest here?” were spoken. In a pivotal scene, a bewildered Sasha Keyes sums up all we’ve learned by citing the “Buddhist Lineage of Mis-steps”, in which it is the seeker’s mistakes and failings, not their spiritual achievements, that lead to enlightenment. It is a somehow fitting climax to a book in which Barker seems incapable of putting a foot wrong. This is satire that sees right through you, but forgives you and teaches you to forgive yourself. It’s that rare thing, a serious work of art that is also a giddy confection: a vehicle of pure delight.TonyInterruptor by Nicola Barker is published by Granta (£16.99).

Democracy and free speech are in freefall. Inequality is soaring, with the 1% scooping up ever-larger shares of global wealth. These days, the US has aGinicoefficient – the most common international measurement of inequality – on a par with slave-owning Ancient Rome. Maternal mortality rates for American millennials are three times higher than those of their parents’ generation – and this in the world’s richest society.Global life expectancy is falling. So, too, are food standards. Outside a few bourgeois sourdough enclaves, real bread has vanished. In its place we get mass-produced, spongy, tasteless “pseudo-bread” – as Guy Debord lamented inThe Encyclopedia of Nuisances. In an earlier age, there would have been bread riots. Now? Just muted indigestion.What accounts for our complacency? False consciousness, claims McDonald in this sparky polemic against the myth of progress. We have been hoodwinked by elite propaganda. The “progress narratives” of the ruling classes assure us that history only moves forward, that we should trust the system and surrender agency to our betters. Even when protests have erupted, they have mostly sought modest tweaks rather than revolution. But progress, argues McDonald, is a false prophet. History hasn’t followed a tidy upward arc. Moreover, what counts as progress has often produced huge collateral damage, including ecological devastation.There was a time when human beings had a “commensalistic” relationship with nature, turning on veneration rather than exploitation. Embracing egalitarianism, most primitive societies didn’t have hierarchies of class or gender. Then, around 3000BCE, the “parasitic” economy emerged. Mesopotamians were the first to behave as though nature was no longer to be communed with but subdued. Religion took the place of animism, preaching dominion over the Earth. For McDonald theEpic of Gilgameshis the first piece of progress propaganda: in it, the eponymous hero kills the forest guardian, tames the wild, and builds a city, filling it with bread and beer to the unbridled joy of his acolytes.The Book of Genesis follows suit. God commands Adam and Eve to “subdue” the Earth and tame every living thing. Later, Christianity – by then a far cry from Jesus’s radicalism – proved useful to Constantine, who saw in monotheism a handy formula: one god, one empire, one emperor. Fast-forward a millennium, and capitalism picks up the baton. Progress, now secularised, means capital formation: wealth siphoned from the masses to the enlightened few, who return to us the bric-a-brac of modernity – antibiotics and air fryers and suchlike. The logic of extraction remains unchanged; nature and proletariat alike suffer.‘I’m certainly open to criticism’: David Wengrow and the trouble with rewriting human historyRead moreMcDonald’s book is a satisfying corrective to the smugness of thinkers such asSteven Pinker, who insist that conditions only ever improve. Yet he oversells his case with sweeping judgments. His account of religion, for instance, amounts to little more than a crude reprise of Marx: it’s all opium for the masses, a tool to pacify resentment. But that’s far too simple. From the Peasants’ Revolt to the Taiping Rebellion, Christianity has supplied radicals with a script for inverting power structures.Equally damaging is McDonald’s uncritical endorsement ofDavid Graeber and David Wengrow’s vigorously contested claim that Enlightenment ideas came from Indigenous America –specifically fromthe Wendat diplomat Kondiaronk – a theory historians such as David A Bell have dismissed as fantasy. On the latter’s account, the French nobleman Baron de Lahontan wasn’t so much lifting his ideas from Kondiaronk as putting his own progressive views into the mouth of a naïf – a common literary device in the early modern period.Readers may find all the doom-mongering a bit much. Indeed, there’s a whiff of the swivel-eyed prophet about McDonald. And like all doomsayers, he is sure that the end-times are nigh. “Climate change and ecological collapse,” we are told, “are very likely to cause political fragmentation that nullifies legal and cultural precedents like [slavery] abolition … If market economies continue, there is little reason to assume they will not return to trade in indentured human beings.” Very likely? The confidence is grating and ignores the simple fact that we no longer live in a labour-intensive economy. If anything, AI is making the return of slavery less, not more, likely. McDonald’s dismissal of the possibility of mass investment in nuclear energy in a “neoliberal” world has already aged poorly, with enormous sums being poured into small modular reactors this year. All of which goes to show that the predictions business is a tough one: things can just as easily go the other way.Progress: A History of Humanity’s Worst Idea by Samuel Miller McDonald is published by HarperCollins (£22).

Within minutes of the insect’s appearance in our periphery, a tide of annoyance rises, and with the quick thwap of a swatter or rolled-up magazine, the bug is gone. Time Flies, a perception-warping bug puzzler, reimagines this inevitably short lifespan as an absurd tragedy – by providing the soon-to-perish pest with a bucket list.Over the course of roughly a minute, players freely buzz around minimalist 2D environments in an effort to make those last wishes come true. The fly’s dreams arrive as vague, far-ranging clues such as “make someone laugh”, “find God”, “start a revolution” and “get rich”, and it’s your job to ricochet around the space until you land, often literally, on a clarifying and usually funny realisation. Similar to Coal Supper’s satirical side-scroller,Thank Goodness You’re Here!, Time Flies relies wholly on experimentation and intuition to understand the world around you, rather than explicit quest markers or info dumps.View image in fullscreenLife’s short … Time Flies.Photograph: Playables / PanicThere are four levels in total, including an art-stuffed museum, a flowing sewer and two busy bric-a-brac filled homes. The game’s scratchy monochromatic visual style frames each space, with the seemingly quaint locations hiding a host of philosophical quandaries and innocuous jokes. Buzzing about, you set off all manner of environmental set-pieces, the details of which are delightfully silly: you can make the Mona Lisa smile by landing on her nose, get drunk on spilled wine, or even grow a flower from a waterlogged corpse. Notably, though, not every action leads to a checked box on the bucket list, and for every Rube Goldberg machine or Jenga tower you discover in the game’s open levels, there are plenty of sharp or gooey life-ending hazards to find as well.The central point of friction here is that there are only so many seconds in a day, and you’ll need to not only discover all the bucket list activities in a level, but also chain them together to unlock the next one. Putting together a perfect route is a straightforward but thoroughly engaging challenge, further complicated by the existence of time-shifting clocks that can be tinkered with to add precious seconds to your painfully short lifespan.Perhaps what makes Time Flies’ conceit so convincing is how infuriating it can be to control the fly, and how annoying it is to listen to its incessant buzzing as you endeavour to meet the criteria. Tapping and holding the arrow keys allows you to direct the fly, but during particularly dexterous activities – such as collecting coins while avoiding an incinerating lightbulb or flying through a statue’s intestines to make it fart – the controls feel appropriately unwieldy. Over time, the repetitious process of reincarnation becomes an uncanny mirror, reflecting our own futile desire for order in a world plagued with unpredictable obstacles. Even with our comparatively epic lifespans, many of us will struggle to achieve some of the fly’s loftier ambitions, unless we reorient what those ambitions mean to us – something that Time Flies insists we contemplate.Mocked by the clock and the whizzing sounds in your ears, Time Flies gets under your skin not only because it’s a clever puzzle game, but because it manages to break down its profound ideas into easily digestible nuggets of gameplay. By blending its thinky thesis with such playful mechanics, Time Flies supplies a lighthearted canvas for players to engage with existentialism for an hour or two. As you seek a sense of meaning for the fly by ticking off their ambitions, there’s plenty of room left for you to muse about your own.Time Flies is out now, £11.49Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesPuzzle gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tom has travelled miles for the funeral of his boyfriend who has died much too young. Deep in the countryside, Ágatha, the bereaved mother, has never heard of Tom and knows nothing of her son’s sexuality. Tom wants to grieve but, out of respect, cannot give voice to his true emotions – not least because the dead man’s brutish brother, Francis, is determined to keep Ágatha in untroubled ignorance.The social awkwardness is part of Michel Marc Bouchard’s play, first seen in Montreal in 2011 and lateradapted for the screen. What director Rodrigo Portella adds to this spellbinding production for Cena Brasil Internacional is a fierce physical awkwardness.It is in the way the actors stand isolated on the desolate stage, designed by Aurora dos Campos in rusty browns that seem to extend for ever. The figures are picked out in lonely relief by Tomás Ribas’s punishing lightning, lost souls on a collision course. It is in the way the stage is puddled with farmyard mud, clinging to the actors and making their discomfort palpable.View image in fullscreenThe death of hope … Tom at the Farm.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAnd it is in the menace of Francis (Iano Salomão), an unreconstructed symbol of macho intolerance. He bears down mercilessly on the urbane Tom, played with grace and some resistance by Armando Babaioff who, as translator, relocates the script to Bolsonaro’s Brazil, the country reported to have the world’shighest rate of violent deathsof LGBTQ+ people.Coupled with the stately pace of a broody, intense production, it makes this farm not just a reactionary backwater, but a cultural dead end. It is a place where any possibility of progress is extinguished like the sickly cattle Francis throws into a ditch. The play becomes not just about the death of a son but about the death of hope.Even if Ágatha (Denise Del Vecchio) is not as clueless as Francis makes out and even if Tom becomes paralysed by Stockholm syndrome, this awful scenario can surely not persist. Arriving from the city, Sara (Camila Nhary) throws brief light on a self-destructive culture eating itself from within. It is as cruel as it is mesmerising.At thePleasance at EICC, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

They split over Trump. But few schisms can have been more severe than that of playwright Gabriel Jason Dean and his brother. It is a relationship that inspired this probing two-hander in which a bookish student at the start of a literary career (Blake Stadnik) visits his incarcerated sibling (Matt Monaco), hoping to help with his legal claim for release. As their meetings unfold over years and then decades, one becomes a celebrated champion of liberal values, while the other emerges as a white supremacist.What hope for reconciliation when each brother has views antithetical to the other’s? It is a theme that was explored by Chris Thorpe inConfirmation(2014), which described the playwright’s real-life attempt to see eye to eye with a Holocaust denier. That play was needling and unsettling in a way this one is not, but what Rift has on its side is the fraternal bond at its heart.With head shaved and swastika tattoo showing beneath his orange jumpsuit, Monaco frightens you with the ferocity of his stare and his air of volatility. In contrast, Stadnik could hardly look prissier with his neat business suit and ethical reading list. Yet these men are not strangers and cannot entirely discount each other. Their childhood history, in particular their repressed memories of abuse, gives them a bond that transcends matters of political difference.Directed with verve and intensity by Ari Laura Kreith for Luna Stage and Richard Jordan Productions, the play is at its most affecting when it reveals the vulnerable boys behind the damaged adults. If there is hope for a polarised culture, this is where it lies. There is humanity and understanding here – joining a far-right brotherhood may be a rational choice if your life depends on it – but Rift lets the audience off lightly by skirting the most awkward questions.At theTraverse, Edinburgh, until 24 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalTraverse theatreUS prisonsreviewsShareReuse this content"

On the one hand: the Mahlerians, drawn by the rare opportunity to hear the composer’s long, early cantata Das klagende Lied, a “concert folk tale” based on a text he penned aged 17, in the original version he completed at 20. On the other: the Boulezians – better catered for than usual inhis centenary year– who thronged for his Rituel in Memoriam Bruno Maderna, performed by the same orchestra who premiered it, with Boulez conducting, in 1975.The fact that Boulez also conducted the first Proms performance ofMahler’s Das klagende Lied (again with the BBCSO) in 1976 presumably encouraged this Prom’s pairing of works. But the juxtaposition did these pieces few favours.In the first half, a slimmed-down BBCSO revelled in Boulez’s analogue spatial audio effects. Rattles were exchanged on snare drums, cymbals and güiros, like enormous snakes facing off across the Royal Albert Hall. There were flurries of chirruping woodwind and abrupt, abrasive cadences, snatched into silence by conductorHannu Lintu, who stood almost motionless except for swift, absolutely economical gestures. Gongs and tam-tams hung on a vast rack were played by two percussionists, two beaters each, their slow dance amid so much metalwork strangely compelling. But the work’s fragmentary nature and peculiar form made for a long half hour.Mahler’s cantata felt longer still. His score offers glimpses of the mature composer to come: surges of symphonic power, natty rhythmic corners, beautiful chiaroscuro effects. But there are also numerous less persuasive turns of phrase. His teenaged pseudo-folk tale meanders repetitively and his text-setting poses real challenges for the solo singers. The adults –Natalya Romaniw,Jennifer Johnston,Russell ThomasandJames Newby– fared better here than the two heftily miked boy choristers, but there were nevertheless balance problems throughout. TheBBC Symphony ChorusandConstanza Chorusinjected warmth and vigour and much of the orchestral playing was a deluxe, Mahler-in-HD affair. But not even that, alas, could save the piece from itself.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

It now takes centre stage, as he develops his performance style far beyond clowning to address the plight of his compatriots in the Middle East. Its title, Peace de Resistance, implies a rallying call, but he delivers something different: a compelling collage of historical storytelling, jokes about colonialism, and a silent-comedy style that remains defiantly goofy in the face of abomination.The main strand puts theGazaemergency into its historical context, telling the story of an exiled Palestinian Lothario who falls in love with an Algerian freedom fighter in the 1960s. The brief romance acts like a siren call to Merguez to acknowledge his own people’s oppression and displacement. But – like Wardeh himself, perhaps – he feels sickened and helpless in the face of that enormity, and loth to abandon his carefree life.The Horse of Jenin review – a funny, haunting coming-of-age tale of boyhood in occupied PalestineRead moreSpliced with this tale, we get our part-Irish host, in character as aDave Allen-alike raconteur, telling “an Englishman, an Irishman and a Palestinian” gags that expose the cynicism of British imperialism; and a hand-puppet dumbshow about two fluttering birds torn between loving and consuming one another, which you might – if you squint – interpret as an allegory of Israel-Palestine. Among several archival clips probing the psychological experience of dispossession, Wardeh samples Churchill, arguing for resistance to oppression as not warlike but as “the sole guarantee of peace”.Add to this personal and family memories (his first visit to al-Aqsa mosque, say) recalled by our host himself, stepping out from behind the disguises, and you have a show with lots going on, and lots of emotional significance, implied if seldom directly stated. It feels like the show of an artist still fathoming whether and how (his) art can encompass the Palestinian people’s predicament. The clowning can feel like a relic from Bedu – but also like an appropriately absurdist response to a political situation that is itself beyond sense. It’s an impressive attempt – and no mean achievement – to wrestle something terrible into the shape of a comedy show.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreClownsGazaEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a brilliant creative job where I worked with primary school kids who were struggling with home and school life. We had one little boy, aged seven, who was a world of chaos, he found it hard to connect with others and he had a tough exterior on show nearly all the time. However, a couple of times a week, we had story time in the library, a quiet and tiny room, and he would always, without fail, come and sit as close to me as he could, and ask very quietly for “Bogalabol” – Burglar Bill. He would then listen with rapture and delight to the whole story, and join in with his favourite phrases. As he listened, he became a little boy again, taking pleasure in this story with its salt of the earth burglars, and the simple joy of being read to. It remains one of my favourite memories of that time. Of course I read Burglar Bill to my own kids, and I expect I’ll read it to any grandchildren I have!Tanya Logan, 53, Frome, Somerset‘I used to do my best Ray Winstone growl when reading’I loved Burglar Bill. He steals such bonkers stuff, and then he finds – a baby! And eventually true love with Burglar Betty. I used to read it to my kids doing Burglar Bill in my best Ray Winstone growl. They loved it. The books were a great way to introduce my own kids to reading, and later many others when I worked as an English teacher.Esther Pocock, librarian, SwedenThe Happy Families books‘I still use the letter he wrote to me to this day’I’m a primary school teacher and about 12 years ago I wrote to Allan Ahlberg with my class. He took care to write a really individual letter back to us, addressing every child’s comments (and mine), and he also shared some early drafts of Mrs Wobble the Waitress and some copies of a couple of his new books at the time (Hooray for Bread was one of them). I was really impressed by his generous spirit in replying in such detail, and I still use the letter with classes to this day to say: “Look, real authors need to re-draft, so you should too!”Luke Stratton, 41, primary school teacher, Coalville, LeicestershireEach Peach Pear Plum‘On a whim, I texted my 28-year-old daughter the first line and she replied with the next one – and so it went on for 10 minutes’All of them are favourites – but particularly Each Peach Pear Plum and The Jolly Postman books. On a whim I texted the first line of the former to my 28-year-old daughter the other day. She immediately texted back (while at work I may add) the following line from the book, and so it went on for 10 glorious minutes between us both, word perfect with no cheating, smiling away at our phones. Me – charmed at the way this book has resonated through the years between mother and daughter. She – thrilled with a young child’s delight in being clever in remembering it all in the middle of her busy day. It is still the book I buy for all new parents I come across, as I will do for hers as and when she has children of her own.Jayne Stead, retired teacher, York‘My two girls love it’The wonder of the Ahlbergs’ books span generations and they are so detailed, clever and don’t talk down to children. [Allan’s wife Janet Ahlberg illustrated all his books until her death in 1994.] They are among the few authors I enjoy reading night after night; I received Each Peach Pear Plum from a friend with older children, who wistfully said she could still happily recite it from memory. My two girls love the book.Caroline Haywood, 39, lawyer, Nairobi, KenyaPeepo!‘My child who was non-verbal until three could still communicate by finding items in the pictures’With my own child, who was non-verbal until three, books with things to look for such as Peepo! meant they could still communicate by finding items in the pictures. The repetitive nature also meant things could be mimed or signed. Then when speech came the rhymes were fun and they were reading without noticing! Allan Ahlberg’s books enriched my teaching and the lives of children I know. Isn’t that a special legacy?Kathie, former teacher now works in data protection, St HelensCops and Robbers‘No one could compete with the Ahlbergs’There are so many to choose from but I’d have to opt for Cops and Robbers as it went from mild peril to slapstick comedy and had everything in between. I loved them when I was a kid and when my daughter was little I read her every Janet and Allan Ahlberg book I could get my hands on. We read a lot of books together but no one could compete with the Ahlbergs. They are the greatest children’s authors of all time, bar none.Martin Hall, 46, librarian, Frankfurt, GermanyThe Baby’s Catalogue‘It helped me as a new parent’The Baby’s Catalogue was introduced to me by an unemployed mother while waiting in a Berkeley unemployment line 40 years ago. Two children later, while waiting in a pediatrician’s office I discovered a ratty copy of Burglar Bill on the book pile. The story was so enchanting that I am ashamed to say I nicked it. The Baby Catalogue helped me as a new parent understand that the smallest, mundane parts of a child’s day could be beautiful and important to them so to accept it with patience and grace. As for Burglar Bill, my boys didn’t turn to a life of crime like their mother. In my defence I’ve taken good care of the book.Kathy Nilsson, 67, retired, Mountain View, CaliforniaFunny Bones‘To open his books is to feel a jolt of warmth and home again’I had all but forgotten about Ahlberg’s books until I started working as a children’s bookseller. To discover them again, to turn the pages 20 years on from the last time, made me ache for a time and a place long gone. That feeling never leaves me. Peepo! and Each Peach Pear Plum both sit on my son’s bookshelves and even though I see the spines every single day, to open them is to feel that jolt of warmth and home again. They are perfection. Funny Bones has now become one of my son’s favourite books.

I texted him already, saying, ‘I hear the reviews are great, and it’s tracking well.’ He was very happy to hear from me, and we’ll probably get together later in the month when the smoke clears.”He continued: “I’m excited about it because it just shows that there’s a strong market for comedy in movie theatres, and spoof in particular.”Last year, the director was less enthusiastic, saying of the reboot: “Paramount is just going ahead and doing it, they haven’t involved me. They’re just gonna do what they want, that’s Hollywood.” Zucker and the franchise’s other co-creators, including his brother Jerry Zucker, had previously pitched a fourth-instalment script focusing on the thirtysomething son of the main character Frank Drebin, but it was rejected by the studio.“We were not excited about having the franchise given to other people,” he continued. “They have not contacted me to make a cameo or be involved in the writing. Whether or not they’re going to do a good job with it, this kind of spoof, I mean it’s not rocket science, but it’s not easy.”Earlier this year,Zucker reiterated his disapproval, saying he was “not planning on seeing the Naked Gun remake”.View image in fullscreenLeslie Nielsen in Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear.Photograph: Paramount/Sportsphoto/Allstar“I regret having seen the trailer for it,” he continued, before comparing the promo to a 2007 Brazilian pornographic film. “It’s like watching 2 Girls 1 Cup. I can’t unsee it.”Despite his turnaround, Zucker reiterated his aversion to seeing the film to Hollywood Reporter, but said that the team behind it had reached out to him before its release.“I’m not gonna see it, but I don’t see any of the sequels that were of my material done by other people, and that’s fine. I’ve told Akiva that I have no intention to see it,” he said.“He actually invited me to come see an early cut of it, but I told him there’s nothing I could do to help because it really isn’t what I would have done. That’s not to say that he didn’t actually end up doing a good movie. But I don’t think I could help with that.”Zucker added that producer Seth MacFarlane had phoned him shortly after the new script had been completed.“He spent the first 10 minutes telling me how much he loved Airplane!, The Naked Gun and Top Secret!,” said Zucker. “I can’t get mad at anyone who will tell me what a genius I am. That was a good conversation. I was glad that Seth called, but I told him politely, ‘Good luck, but I can’t put my name on this.’ [But] everything happens for a reason.”The new Naked Gunfilm stars Neesonas Frank Drebin Jr, alongside Pamela Anderson and Danny Huston.In his four-star review, the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw praised it as “amiably ridiculous, refreshingly shallow, entirely pointless and guilelessly crass”.Explore more on these topicsFilmLeslie NielsenLiam NeesonPamela AndersonComedy filmsDanny HustonnewsShareReuse this content"

Then, in the 1990s, gastropubs brought new flavours, energy and ideas. When and why did it all start to go downhill again?Steve RoseTue 5 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 04.44 EDTShareIt was supposed to be a special occasion: an extended family get-together for Sunday lunch at a country pub. The setting was promising: a traditional establishment recently redecorated; outside terrace by the river; plenty of customers. The menu was also promising: a giant sheet of paper like a medieval charter, with glowing descriptions of how they aged their beef and sourced their produce locally.The food, though, was awful. The starters were assorted deep-fried pellets of unidentifiable organic matter; the meat was cold and colourless, the gravy watery, the roast potatoes soggy and the yorkshire pudding chewy as a dishcloth. It was very difficult to believe all of this had been freshly prepared in the kitchen that day. It felt more like reheated leftovers – for £30 a head.You may, like me, have had this experience – and the lower-budget equivalent, the pub menu that consists of 700 variations of pie or burger, all of which arrive at the table via the freezer and the microwave, molten hot and almost glowing. With chips.How did pub food get so grim? We like to think the bad old days of British cuisine, the days when it was a national embarrassment, are far behind us, that the 1990s and 2000s ushered in a wave of quality gastropubs and that the shires are bursting with talented chefs cooking local produce from scratch. In some cases, that is true, but more broadly – in my view, at least – pub food in the UK is on the decline.View image in fullscreen‘Molten hot and almost glowing’ … frozen burgers and pies are commonplace in British pubs.Photograph: Artur Kozlov/Getty Images“You’re definitely not alone,” saysKatie Mather, a drinks writer and pub culture blogger. “There is evidence to support your hypothesis.”Ray Bailey, one half of the bloggersBoak & Baileyand a co-author of20th Century Pub, also agrees. “Pub food has quietly been on the decline for a few years now, both in terms of quality and availability. There was a golden period during which you could rely on being able to get a solid meal for a reasonable price, but now many pubs have closed their kitchens or outsourced food to fast food popups.”Pubs have never had it so hard, you could argue. They face significant and often inexorably increasing costs: rent; staffing (partly as a result of the recentnational insurance contribution increases); energy (to heat and chill food and people); alcohol (duty on a bottle of 14.5% red wine hasrisen by nearly £1in the past two years); and food (one chef tells me beef has gone up 50% in the past eight months). This comes on top of Covid recovery and the cost of living crisis. According to the British Beer and Pub Association,15,000 pubshave closed in the past 25 years. There are still roughly 45,000 left, but the UK is losing aboutsix pubs a week.Last orders: Pubs in Britain will close at rate of one a day in 2025, trade body warnsRead more“Pub food used to be the moneymaker, but with the rising price of literally everything, it really isn’t as cheap to do that any more,” says Mather. “For a long time, business owners have been able to hide the effects from customers to a certain degree; they’ve been able to cut corners in kind of invisible ways. But it’s become so difficult to deal with.”Pubs have had it hard for a long time, says Brian Hannon, a co-founder of the London-based restaurant groupSuper 8, which includes Brat, Kiln and Smoking Goat. Previously, he worked for 18 years in the pub sector. The shake-up began with thebeer ordersin 1989. In an attempt to improve competition, the government limited the number of tied pubs a brewery could own to 2,000. At the time, 75% of UK pubs were controlled by six breweries (Bass, for example, had to sell nearly 5,000 of its 7,000 pubs) and 95% of their revenue came from drinks. This change created conditions for new pub chains and independents to flourish. By the time the beer orders were revoked, in 2003, the industry had been transformed.Habits were changing, too. By the 2000s, we had what Hannon calls the three Fs: “Food, females and fenestration.” Pubs opened up literally and socially, while food revenues made up for declining drinks sales. It was the era of new chains, such as All Bar One, and the original gastropubs, such asthe Eagle in Clerkenwell, London. Pub food became a route to culinary acclaim and celebrity. In 2001, the Stagg Inn in Herefordshire became the first pub to receive a Michelin star. The Hand and Flowers,Tom Kerridge’s pub in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, has two stars.View image in fullscreenThe now defunct Canal Tavern in Coventry. Bass was one of the breweries forced to sell pubs by the 1989 beer orders, which transformed the industry.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesThis era didn’t last long, though. “I refuse to use the word gastropub, because I don’t think it means anything any more,” says Oisín Rogers, a co-founder ofthe Devonshire, one of London’s hottest pubs. “Gastropubs in the 90s and the 2000s were always chef or mom-and-pop operations where you’d have a single freeholder or leaseholder who was in the kitchen all the time, cooking from scratch, making really delicious things in a place they were really proud of. And that was copied by the [pub chains]. They’d say: ‘Look, this is a gastropub. It’s the same colour and the menu looks a bit similar,’ but actually you’re getting a far inferior product.” The Good Food Guide stopped using the term “gastropub” in 2011. These days, you are more likely to see the word in supermarkets: Marks & Spencer has a“Gastropub” rangeof ready meals created by Kerridge.Hannon breaks down today’s pub food landscape into three brackets. At one end are those putting a premium on quality food and targeting customers willing to pay for it. At the other end are the big chain pubs, operating on the basis of low cost and high margins. “The lower the price, the more likely it’s been bought in and not been cooked by a chef,” Hannon says. However, he adds: “The chains will apply their skill set and their muscle to actually get not-bad food produced well.”In the perilous middle ground, smaller chains and independent pubs try to present a gastropub-looking menu for minimum outlay and maximum profit, which, in this climate, necessitates compromises – and may well explain my unsatisfactory Sunday roast. (On closer inspection, the pub in question turned out to be part of a group, offering very similar menus across several sites, which suggests some degree of centralisation.)Pub food used to be the moneymaker, but with the rising price of literally everything, it isn’t as cheap to do that“What often happens is the guy who’s running the pub has a spreadsheet that’s been sent down saying: ‘This is where you get your beef, this is where you get your yorkshire pudding, here’s the instructions on how to do it,’” says Rogers. “And they’ve followed the instructions, maybe not completely correctly, and ended up with an inferior product on the plate.”Hannon says: “The people in the middle are making no money out of producing food because, number one, the cost of employing a chef is really high and, number two, it’s hard to actually get the staff, especially given that pubs are often out in the countryside. And then the economics of running those have been really challenged. So what they’re now doing is de-skilling their food.”A pub menu will never say: “We don’t actually make this food ourselves.” But more and more pubs are quietly outsourcing some or all of their cooking. “We’ve heard stories of pub kitchens serving microwavable supermarket ready meals because they’re cheap, last for ever in the freezer and have incredibly high mark-up,” says Bailey. Even big names have been caught out. In 2009, Gordon Ramsay was found to have been serving food prepared at a central kitchen in three of his London gastropubs, presenting it as “freshly made”, at considerably inflated prices.One indicator of this trend is the growth of external catering firms. Visit the website of Brakes, the market leader, and you will find more than 9,000 products: everything from fresh, raw ingredients to frozen pub grub – 20 formed cod fillets in batter for £1.69 each, yorkshire puddings for 35p each. They do 66 kinds of chip, says Paul Hulyer, Brakes’ head of hospitality customer marketing. He doesn’t provide exact figures on how their pub business is doing, but he says: “We’ve sustained very good, healthy volumes in the sector.”Having worked for pub chains himself, Hulyer knows how the pressures have grown. “One of the things I’ve noticed is more pubs want to try to dosomecooking,” he says. “When I worked in kitchens, everything was cooked from scratch, you had 12 people in the kitchen, whereas now, with all the increasing costs, you’ve got to do similar with four or five people. How do you do that? Well, you take some of the prep out. That’s what we help to do.”View image in fullscreenTom Kerridge at The Hand and Flowers in Marlow, which has two Michelin stars.Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/PAFor example, Brakes sells a whole beef brisket, Hulyer explains. “We’ve done the seven-, eight-hour cook so you’ve not had to. And [the pub kitchen] would take it, defrost it and portion it. And then they would say: ‘Right, I’m going to flavour this with …’ and they would personalise it.” If they don’t want to do even that, Brakes also offers a range of sauces.Brakes is scrupulous about food standards and responsible sourcing, of course, but it has little control over what goes on in the kitchens it supplies (assuming anything is going on beyond setting a timer on a microwave) or how their products appear on menus. The language can often be wilfully obscure, with terms such as “homemade” and “freshly prepared” covering a multitude of sins, says Rogers. “Some of the big chains will say they do aged beef, for example, which doesn’t mean dry aged; it just means it’s been kept in a vacuum bag.” There are also dodgy supply chains, he says, such as what has been called “long-range chicken”, “where you buy chicken that was bred in Vietnam, packed in Singapore, injected with fillers in the Netherlands and then arrived frozen to a cash-and-carry in the UK”.Everyone seems to have horror stories. “When I worked as a waiter in a chain pub in the 1990s, the ‘homemade’ steak and kidney pie was assembled from a sachet of brown goop emptied into a dish with an oval of pre-made pastry popped on top,” says Bailey.The quality end of the pub food spectrum comes with its own challenges. While pub chains may operate on a profit margin of 70%, serving fresh, quality food is far less profitable, which inevitably means higher prices for customers. Mains at the Devonshire’s upstairs restaurant are £20 to £40, not counting side dishes, although they do cheaper bar snacks downstairs.Sunday lunchat the Hand and Flowers will set you back £175.The Devonshire, London W1: ‘The epitome of comfort food’ – restaurant review | Grace Dent on restaurantsRead moreWhen that is the case, Mather asks, can we still call these places pubs? “I would argue that they focus so much on food that now they are just restaurants.” She defines a pub as “a place that I would feel comfortable drinking in without having a meal”. Those places do exist, she says, citing her local in Lancashire. “They do fantastic food, but I could sit in there with pints, just reading a book. I don’t feel as if I’m in the way, or taking up a table that someone else might eat at, whereas there are pubs that have gone completely the other way.” It’s almost as if “gastro” and “pub” are going their separate ways.So how can you avoid disappointment with your pub meal? What are the warning signs?“Because I’m in the industry, I always look at the tills,” says Rogers. “If the tills are the corporate type, where it’s the same system that’s run all over the country, then I’m always suspicious.”Hannon says: “Look at the menu: size, focus, how it is actually presented. No laminated menus, no menus that try to be Chinese, Indian and Sunday roast. Talk to the staff about where the produce is from, how long the chef has been there.”Rogers continues: “I think one way to spot a really good, decent pub menu is that it’s short. If you’ve got 35 main courses and 20 starters, you can be certain that most of that is in the freezer.” Look for closer to six starters, mains and desserts.“If I go to a chain pub somewhere that I’ve not been to before and I look at the menu and it’s like ‘lasagne’, then you just know that that’s frozen and microwaved,” says Mather. “The fish and chips – that’s going to be frozen as well. Unless there’s a good specials menu, or it’s got really good local reviews, I would eat somewhere else.”There may be other solutions. In 2014, France launched afait maison(homemade) scheme, whereby restaurants that genuinely made their food in-house could display a special logo. The scheme never caught on, but there areplans to revive itand make it mandatory. At the same time, especially in UK cities, there has been a resurgence of what might be called “drinking pubs”, where the emphasis is on the beer or wine, rather than the food: microbreweries, tap rooms and the like.There is also a growing appetite for locally owned pubs, says Mather, who just visited one in the Lake District. “Their food was fantastic and their entire staff seemed to care a lot about the food and drink that they’re serving.”Pubswere once the heart of the community and some places are successfully keeping them that way, not just with food and drink, but as gathering spaces for all manner of functions: artistic performances, family events, markets, workshops. The best boozers have always moved with the times, but also respected their hungry, cash-strapped customers – who can tolerate only so many soggy roast potatoes.This article was amended on 5 August 2025.

She has only had a couple of long-term relationships. I didn’t think the number bothered me: Ididn’t know her then,it was before we got togetherandwe can’t change the past. However, we hardly ever have sex (only once everythree to four months) and her sex drivedropped off a cliff after our first child was born almost 10 years ago. She says it’s the stress of children but I can’t helpfeelingshe just doesn’t find me attractive any more. Rightly or wrongly, I nowfeel upsetthat she waswilling to have sex with so many people before me but doesn’t want to have sex with me.When a partner’s libido drops, it is very common for the other to assume that the partner no longer feels the same attraction as before, but this is often not the case. It is very likely that your wife is finding it hard to summon sexual feelings generally because she does not feel like a sexual being herself. To experience desire for another person, you must feel sexually confident in yourself.Sexual confidence includes having a positive body image and perceiving yourself as a person who could attract others. It is true that the presence of children can lead to a disruption of libido through lack of privacy, fatigue, worry and other factors and it can also cause a woman to lose sight of the sexual person she once was. That conversation about her previous partners may even have been a misguided attempt on her part to excite you and reconnect herself with her previous erotic nature.Instead of focusing on her past, try to think of ways to help her think of herself as a sensual being, perhaps by looking back on erotic moments at the beginning of your relationship. Sometimes returning to situations where you shared such moments can serve as reminders and inspiration to help you return to intimacy.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

I wandered through the ancient city and was astounded by the beauty of the place – and just as much by its food. I tasted grilled meats cooked over open fires on the streets, and had a kofta dish served withcacik, a classic cucumber and mint sauce, that was so intensely delicious that the moment has been distilled in my memory. Mince, with good provenance and the right amount of fat to carry flavour and lend moisture, is a kitchen hero. Here, it delivers an astoundingly good dinner inspired by that meal, and which shouldn’t break the bank.Lamb koftas with buttery tomato sauceA deliciously savoury feast of grilled lamb, spices and dill with a richly aromatic saucePrep10 minCook1 hrServes4 with leftoversFor the spice mix2 tsp cumin seeds1 tbsp coriander seeds3-4 fat garlic cloves,peeled1 tsp ground cinnamonSalt and black pepper1 tsp ground turmeric1 tsp ground gingerFor the koftas2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil2 medium red onions, peeled and diced900g lamb mince1 large handful fresh dill, finely choppedFor the tomato sauce50g butter1 large onion, peeled and finely diced2 x 400g tins plum tomatoes2 bay leavesWarm a heavy-based casserole on a medium heat, then gently toast the cumin and coriander seeds for a few minutes. Tip them into a mortar or spice grinde, add the garlic, cinnamon and half a teaspoon of salt, and grind to a paste. Set aside half of the paste for the tomato sauce, then mix the turmeric and ginger into the remaining paste in the mortar.Meanwhile, heat the oil for the koftas in the same pan, add the two diced onions, and sweat with a teaspoon of salt for eight to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlicky paste from the mortar and, once the onions are translucent and smelling tantalisingly good, add the lamb and scrape the mix into a bowl.To make the sauce, put the same pan back on a medium heat, add the butter and onion, and season generously. After eight to 10 minutes, stir in the reserved spice paste and stir-fry for a few minutes. Cut up the tinned tomatoes with scissors or squash them to a pulp, then stir them into the pan with the bay leaves. Stir, then simmer gently over a medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is thick and glossy.Meanwhile, mix the dill in to the bowl of onions and mince, and season with a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper. Mix thoroughly, then, using your hands, shape into equal-sized, flattish torpedo shapes. You should end up with 12-14 in all.When you are ready to eat, heat a griddle, barbecue or frying pan on a high heat until smoking. Griddle or fry the koftas for two to three minutes on each side, until just cooked in the middle.

In fact, a 60-minute walk at an easy 3km an hour can burn between 200 and 300 additional calories, helping those who want to improve their fitness and tone up without the sweatiness and inconvenience of a full-on treadmill session.Walking pads are often cheaper than full-size treadmills, simple to use and relatively easy to store, and they’re perfect for adding more movement to your life without having to give up the day job.At a glanceBestwalking pad overall:JTX MoveLight£449 at JTX FitnessBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmill£142.49 at DebenhamsBest walking pad for beginners:Urevo Strol 2E£169.98 at AmazonBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60£549 at AmazonBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus£224.99 at MobvoiWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does everything from gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes to outdoor trail runs and cold-water surfing. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for industry magazines.I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.I’m a strong believer that you need to live with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. With walking pads, that meant strolling along, racking up the steps and burning calories – even while I wrote up this feature.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Good build quality for the price, and the setup process is painless’: the Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianThere was only one way to properly trial the five walking treadmills we selected for this test, and that’s to mimic the customer journey by ordering, taking delivery, unboxing, setting them up and then shoehorning them into daily life.The best walking treadmills – or walking pads – aren’t quite as bulky asregular running treadmills, so I could have multiple models on the go at home at once: one under my desk, one in front of the television and one in my wife’s office upstairs, rotating through them to ensure the same time – at least three days – was spent on each.The testing process meant a lot of additional steps and – in some cases at least – a whining soundtrack that drowned out whatever Netflix series the family was attempting to enjoy. Besides general observations on the heft, ease of storage, quietness, ease of operation and build quality, I tested any additional features available, such as incline, speed adjustments and any remote controls or apps.To get a good idea of energy consumption and the overall cost of running a walking treadmill, I plugged each unit into a power meter, which offered real-time readouts on energy use, and calculated the cost based on my energy tariff.Here are the five best walking treadmills you can buy now.The best under-desk treadmills and walking pads in 2025View image in fullscreen‘It feels like a walking pad that will go the distance’: the JTX MoveLight.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest overall walking pad:JTX MoveLightView image in fullscreen£449 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonJTX tends to appear in the “best value” section of most reviews of home fitness equipment. The brand is known for offering affordability and reliable build quality, but lacks eye candy and technological flourishes.The MoveLight walking pad is different, though. It happens to be one of the most expensive walking pads we tested. At almost 30kg, it’s also one of the heaviest.That’s no bad thing, though: there’s a tangible difference in the build quality when compared with the much cheaper Rattantree, for example. The JTX also offers a super-sized display, cushioned walking deck and quiet 1hp electric motor. It’s a solid treadmill offering speeds of up to 6km/h, meaning it’s possible to use it for slow jogging without the worry of it falling apart.Why we love itThe JTX is similar in design to the BodyMax reviewed below and has a solid plastic chassis that gives it a more premium feel than its cheaper rivals. There’s also a generous running deck area.The extra-large LED console is easy to use and neatly scrolls through speed, time and step count information as you walk. The shrill beeps upon startup and when you adjust the speed do become tiresome, though. Any office mates will want to throw a pencil at you.A small plastic remote allows you to adjust the speed, stop or start the unit and scroll the display between distance, calories and time on one half, and speed and step count on the other.The 1hp motor is powerful enough to propel the deck up to 6km/h, where it remains much quieter than some of the others tested. The deck cushioning is also tangible underfoot, offering a nice spring that makes longer walking sessions more comfortable.Overall, it feels like a walking pad that will go the distance – and so it should, given the price. But that solid build also makes it a pain to move around the house, with the overall weight requiring some serious muscle to tip it up on to its wheels. It also doesn’t fold like the similarly priced BodyMax machine.Oh, and one final public service announcement: those with wooden floors will want to take care that the wheels and plastic feet don’t scratch the surface during transport.During testing, we found it to be slightly more power-hungry than rivals, supping about 100W at 3.5km/h, meaning it costs about 3p an hour to power – or about 90p a month if used for an hour each day.It’s a shame that …it’s so big and heavy to move around, which makes storing it after each session a chore.Size:147 x 60 x 12.5cm (LWH)Weight:29.5kgWalking deck size:45 x 122cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:3p/hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:noBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmillView image in fullscreen£142.49 at Debenhams£151.99 at BoohooManIt was a bit of a surprise when this Rattantree treadmill arrived sporting HomeFitnessCode branding. It’s a mega-value, fairly generic option that hails from China, and it’s no surprise that it doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of its pricier rivals. The build quality isn’t fantastic, but it is very lightweight, an absolute doddle to use and covers the basics required by most working walkers.It’s marketed for walking and running, with the belt managing speeds of up to 10km/h, but this feels extremely fast for such a barebones machine.Why we love itLet’s get straight to the point: this is a budget option. It’s much cheaper than most of the others tested and doesn’t come with any fancy features such as Bluetooth, incline or built-in speakers.It’s a simple 39 x 104cm revolving running deck, paired with a powerful (but noisy) 2.5hp electric motor that’s able to crank the belt up to 10km/h. Speed adjustment is taken care of by a small remote, which needs two AAA batteries to operate.Upon unboxing, the cost savings are immediately obvious. It is not only light but also basic in its build. A simple steel frame, a motor and a belt are about all you get.A small and often tricky-to-read LED console at the top scrolls through distance travelled, time elapsed and a rough guide to how many calories you’ve burned, but there’s no way of jumping to the data field you want. You just have to wait for it to come around again.The lighter overall weight makes it much easier to move around the house than others, but I found it also started to move around underfoot, creak and generally complain a little as the speeds went beyond 8km/h. Put it this way: I don’t think this lightweight walking pad would last an indoor marathon at a training pace.As a simple walking pad to tuck under a desk, though, it’s absolutely fine. The belt needed adjusting after about a week of use, but slurping just 70W of power at 3.5km/h means it costs pennies to use daily.It’s a shame that …it cranks up to speeds of 10km/h because it doesn’t feel sturdy enough for those speeds.Size:122 x 49 x 14cm (LWH)Weight:19kgMaximum user weight:109kgAverage running cost:2p/hourWalking deck size:39 x 104cmIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:noBest walking pad for beginners:Urevo Strol 2EView image in fullscreen£169.98 at AmazonIt’s difficult to separate the Strol 2E from the Mobvoi below, with both opting for a slimline, folding handle design that allows them to transform from simple under-desk walking pads to more traditional running treadmills.Built of sturdier stuff than its doppelganger, the Strol also brings an impressive digital offering into the mix with the Urevo smartphone and tablet app. This provides free virtual walks and collates daily, weekly and monthly workout information.With an impressively quiet and powerful 2.25hp electric motor and plenty of shock absorption underfoot, it’s a great way to rack up additional steps during the day, whether from speedier walking sessions or even light jogs.Why we love itAside from representing excellent value for money, the Strol 2E is smaller, easier to store and less of a task to move around the house than some of its counterparts. Its slim profile means it will slip under a sofa or bed when not in use.The downside of this is a small walking deck, which is particularly lacking in length. This makes it easy to run out of room if you have longer legs, and makes faster running sessions particularly awkward for anyone taller than 5ft. Urevo opts for a folding handle that flips up in running mode. This includes a magnetic safety catch that clips to your clothes and automatically shuts off the unit if you inadvertently run out of deck space.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The free-to-download app offers virtual walks and allows you to set workouts based on time, step and calorie goals. You can control the speed of the treadmill from your phone or tablet, or use a slick remote control that can also turn off the annoying beeps at the press of a button.It comes with a plastic device holder that can be clipped on to the safety handle for bingeing Netflix or enjoying one of those scenic virtual tours – although you’ll need headphones because there’s no built-in speaker. For the price, it’s an accomplished package and excellent value for money.It’s a shame that …the belt is so short, making it awkward to run on. Taller users will probably find the walking deck too small for longer strides, too.Size:122 x 57 x 99cm (LWH)Weight:21.4kgWalking deck size:38 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgAverage running cost:3p/hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60View image in fullscreen£549 at AmazonThe most expensive model on test, the BodyMax walking pad also happens to be one of the best built and easiest on the eye. It’s the only model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a cupboard or wardrobe.However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its end and rolled around.Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and average calorie burn.Very much the Porsche of the walking pad world, the BodyMax unit combines stylish looks and powerful performance – but it does require deep pockets.Why we love itLike most walking pads tested here, it comes with a small remote control to adjust the speed, but there’s also a clever automatic mode – or A Mode – that senses the foot placement and automatically adjusts the speed.Remain in the middle of the deck, and the walking pad will keep the same pace; walk towards the front, and it speeds up; hang back, and it slows things down. This is a really handy feature, meaning you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling.The deck itself is nicely cushioned, and the motor is among the quietest on test. It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all.Those wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of a sprint session.If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60 walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive.Size:143 x 55 x 13cm (LWH)Weight:28kgWalking deck size:42 x 120cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:2.5p/hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:yes, folds in half for storageBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill PlusView image in fullscreen£224.99 at MobvoiMobvoi is best known for itsTicWatchline of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-valuewireless headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK.One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’sHome Treadmill SE, as well as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for height.The build quality is good for the price, and the setup process is painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a versatile choice for home users.Why we love itMobvoi manages to make its Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the price soaring.It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy, so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though.When “folded” into walking mode, the built-in handrail lies flat, allowing you to slide it under a standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust the speed and turn the machine on and off.It doesn’t fold in half for storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so long as you have 12cm or more of clearance.It includes a safety mechanism for running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous.When extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running deck isn’t big enough, and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed.The pad does offer an efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles.In terms of efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed, meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common tariffs.Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair with virtual workout software such asZwift, while a built-in speaker allows music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great – you’d be far better off with a good pair ofheadphonesinstead.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss, and the legs add only a tiny bit of incline.Size:138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode) (LWH)Weight:24.6kgWalking deck size: 42 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgAverage running cost:2p/hourIncline:six degreesMaximum speed:12km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenUsing a walking pad for an hour each day should only add about £10 a year to your energy bills.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianHow much should I spend?Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most affordable costing about £100. Anything less than that is unlikely to last until the end of the month.From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. But some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These high-end models typically cost about £500.How much room do you need?If you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle, and you’re basically there.Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move without help.How easy is it to maintain a walking pad?Most walking pads come with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement. Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre.Quickly check the deck alignment and any moving parts every couple of months, and it should be enough to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years.Do walking pads use a lot of electricity?Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running treadmill counterparts, and they often do away with power-sapping incline motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral.During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed increased.Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym membership, but more costly than getting out in nature.Can I run on a walking pad?Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description.Some walking pads we tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a separate safety system: a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If this becomes detached, the machine shuts off.It’s worth noting that the general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer runs.On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when using them at higher speeds.In summary,running treadmillsare better suited to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which makes longer, faster sessions more comfortable and easier on the joints.Leon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

On other voyages you may see glorious sunsets, rare migratory birds, ruined castles and historic lighthouses. Unlike the classic road trip or the great railway journey, however, the humble ferry rarely makes it to anyone’s bucket list. They are a means to an end, only chosen by necessity. And yet, the UK has some of the best and most exhilarating voyages within its borders. From exciting river crossings to island odysseys that test the mettle of the best sea captains, these boat journeys can be the high point of any trip.Whale-watching on the way from Cornwall to the Isles of ScillyStarting from Penzance’s South Pier, in sight of St Michael’s Mount, the crossing to St Mary’s is the indispensable highlight of any trip to the Isles of Scilly. The gas-guzzling, climate-clobbering helicopter doesn’t even approach the magic of this ship and its three-hour voyage into the Atlantic Ocean. Penzance bursts with nautical heritage; many of its remarkable number of pubs have existed since the days of Captain Kidd and Francis Drake. Once aboard the Scillonian (built in Appledore, Devon, in 1977), find a position with a view to the starboard to glimpse Land’s End on departure, then keep a lookout for wildlife. Dolphins and whales are sighted regularly on the voyage. Birdlife includes gannets, Manx shearwaters and puffins. Watch out for bird feeding frenzies, which may attract the attention of bluefin tuna (the half-ton fish can leap clear of the water and numbers are rising fast). Other potential highlights include fin whales, the planet’s second largest animal after the blue whale – with several sightings in 2024.A dayreturn on theScillonian IIIis£35.Woodstock Ark, asecluded cabinnear Penzance South Pier, sleeps two, from£133a night.Star Castle Hotel,close to the Scillonian’s arrival point on St Mary’s,has great food and superb views; doubleswith dinner from £245.A tugboat tow on theRiver Dartin DevonView image in fullscreenThere has been a ferry across the River Dart since the 14th century.Photograph: Candy Apple Red Images/AlamyDartmouth has a huge heritage of sailing and boats, and the lower ferry across the mouth of the River Dart is an absolute classic. The best approach is on thesteam railwayfrom Paignton, which brings you into what was once the Great Western Railway’s imposing Kingswear station on the east bank of the river. Alternatively, you could walk to Kingswear on theSouth West Coast Pathfrom Brixham (a 10-mile yomp). There has been a ferry here since the 14th century and the latest incarnation is a barge with room for eight cars towed by a tugboat. The crossing is short but memorable, the flanks of the steeply wooded valley looming over a fast-moving tidal river that froths around the barge as it picks its way through a busy shipping lane. Landing is right in town, next to the blue plaque for John Davis, one of the great sea dogs of Devon, who searched for the Northwest Passage and died at the hands of pirates near Singapore in 1605. If the crossing has whetted the appetite, walk upriver along the historic waterfront to the Upper Dart ferry, another interesting boat. Originally a floating platform linked to cross-river chains that were pulled by horses, today it’s a diesel-electric paddle engine combined with cables that can manage about 18 cars.TheLower Dart Ferrycosts£5 return for a foot passenger; car and passengers £14 return.Ferrysideapartmentnext to the ferry in Kingswear sleeps four, from£533 for three nights.

A hop of just nine nautical miles and taking an hour, it crosses the shallow Sound of Harris, which is strewn with deadly rocks, dangerous tidal currents and frequent mists. Before GPS, it was a rule that the captain would turn back if he couldn’t see two buoys ahead, and occasionally the ship would slither on to a sandbank and have to stay there until the tide lifted her off. These days it remains an exhilarating passage, weaving between dozens of jagged hazards with evocative names such as Drowning Rock and the Black Curran. Listen for the ghostly cries of seals on the larger islets, and look out for a majestic white-tailed sea eagle.TheCaledonian MacBrayne ferrycosts£4.70 one way for a foot passenger.Camping atBalranaldonNorth Uist is highly recommended (tent £14), or try30 Backhill, a restored thatched stone croft on Berneray, from£535a week.Crossing Harwich harbourfrom Suffolk to EssexView image in fullscreenPassengers boarding the Harwich harbour ferry in Felixstowe, Suffolk.Photograph: Geog Photos/AlamyAs a shortcut at the end of the Suffolk coastal path, the ferry fromLandguard Fortnear Felixstowe to Harwich offers great panoramas of the harbour formed by the rivers Orwell and Stour. You’re likely to spot some of the planet’s largest container ships and a Thames barge. Alternatively, embark at Shotley Gate, the tip of the narrow and beautiful Shotley peninsula that separates the two rivers – the walk down the Orwell from Ipswich is particularly picturesque, taking in Pin Mill. Harwich old town is also well worth exploring, with some beautiful period buildings including the Electric Cinema, opened in 1911.TheHarwich Harbour Ferryconnects Felixstowe and Harwich (tickets £6 oneway), and Harwichand Shotley (£4.80); it runsfrom Aprilto October.

Despite some deplorable environmental mismanagement upstream, the river here remains a beautiful sight. On the far bank, take the lane north to another good pub,Ye Old Ferrie Inn. Their ferry drops you on a footpath that heads up through the woods for the fine views along the curving river from the Symonds Yat rock itself. These crags were visited in 1770, by schoolmasterWilliam Gilpin, who had an eye for untamed landscapes, triggering a revolution in the appreciation of views and nature that we still benefit from today.

This is the last manually operated turntable ferry in the world (built in Troon in 1969), carrying just six cars and 12 people on a five-minute voyage. Due to strong tidal currents running at up to nine knots and frequently windy conditions, the designers came up with the ingenious solution of aturntable to allow vehicles to disembark safely. Saved by a local campaign in 2006, it has now become a vital part of the Skye experience.TheIsle of Skye ferryfrom Glenelgcosts£3 forfoot passengers, and £20 for a car(with up to four passengers)one way.

I repotted it into a slightly larger pot with no drainage holes and a layer of gravel at the bottom, but it continues to decline despite weekly watering. How can I save my plant?DiagnosisYour mistletoe cactus probably isn’t getting sufficient hydration. Cautious watering can lead to soil that is superficially damp but remains dry at a deeper level. This often manifests as browning stems, shrivelling and segments dropping off as the plant becomes stressed due to a lack of moisture at the roots.Houseplant clinic: why has my aloe vera gone floppy?Read morePrescriptionRepot into a pot with drainage holes, or use a nursery pot inside the decorative pot. Use compost specifically designed for succulents or cacti. After repotting, give it a thorough watering until water flows from the drainage holes. Then, let it dry out somewhat between waterings, typically every one to two weeks. Mistletoe cacti thrive on consistent moisture but detest waterlogged conditions, so good drainage is essential.PreventionEnsure that pots used for succulents and cacti have sufficient drainage holes. Regularly checking soil moisture by touching the soil a few centimetres down helps you accurately judge watering needs.Got a plant dilemma?

After three days, Kisha Domínguez, her sister, knew something was wrong. She made the eight-hour car journey with their mother, Aracely Martínez Villanueva, from the city of Oaxaca. When they arrived, they found Sandra’s home empty, her car abandoned. Her husband had also disappeared.Six months later, on 24 April, their bodies were found on a ranch 21 miles from María Lombardo.Sandra and her husband, Alexander Hernández, might have gone down as two more victims of the violence that grips Mexico, whereroughly 30,000 people are murdered each year. But this time the case shot to national attention.Sandra was a feminist activist, known for helping the families of disappeared women and for twice rocking the political establishment in Oaxaca by denouncing powerful men involved in misogynistic WhatsApp groups.Sandra was a pioneer. She always said we had to be fearlessThe uproar over her disappearance seemed to spur the investigation, leading to the discovery of the bodies – an exception in a country where most who disappear are never found.Yet, who murdered the couple – and why – remains unclear. Authorities claim Sandra was “collateral damage” in a conflict between criminal groups. Her family, who now take care of her teenage daughter, believe her murder was tied to her activism.View image in fullscreenPhotos of Sandra Domínguez as a child.Photograph: Maria Alferez/The GuardianSandra was born in San Isidro Huayápam, an Indigenous Mixe community in Oaxaca. She studied law at university, before founding the Liberal Union of Oaxacan Women, an association to promote women’s rights. She spent time encouraging women from Mixe communities (also known as the Ayuuk), many of whom are relatively poor and marginalised, to get into politics. She also rescued women from domestic abuse.“Sandra was a pioneer, a woman who stood up to men with machetes,” says a friend, who asked to remain anonymous for their safety. “The authorities don’t get involved in such things: they say they are marital problems. She always said we had to be fearless.”Quick GuideWhat is 'She counts'?ShowWe are living with  a global femicide crisis across the world today, with a woman or girl killed by their partner or a close relative every 10 minutes,according to the UN. The 'She counts' series will report on stories behind this  epidemic.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sandra’s activism sometimes set her against local, male-dominated political power structures. In 2020, she confronted them head on. When she found out about amisogynistic WhatsApp groupin which politicians and officials shared intimate images of Indigenous women – including her – she blew the whistle.The ensuing uproar set back the careers of powerful men, who had to leave their jobs or give up candidacies for political posts. But it also cost Sandra career opportunities, says her family. “Sandra paid dearly for denouncing that group,” says Kisha. “She lost a lot of friends in politics.”The following year, she moved to María Lombardo, where she helped mediate relations between Mixe communities. She also kept up her activism, helping victims of rape and families of disappeared or murdered women.In 2023, she made national news again when she helped Aracely Cruz, a Mixe economist, denounce her ex-partner, Donato Vargas Jiménez, a powerful political figure in Oaxaca, for domestic violence – and for his participation in another misogynistic WhatsApp group similar to the one in 2020.“Without knowing me, she came to my defence. She was the best friend I could have found in that moment,” says Cruz.View image in fullscreenFamily members, including Aracely Martínez and Kisha Domínguez, Sandra’s mother and sister, grieving.Photograph: Maria Alferez/The GuardianAfter that, her family says Sandra received anonymous phone calls describing her movements and telling her they would be “her shadow”. When Cruz won a seat in parliament in the 2024 elections, she wanted Sandra to join her team inMexicoCity, but Sandra said no.Cruz says: “I asked her if I had done something wrong. She simply said, ‘No, just look after yourself.’ And that left me worried. Why did she say that?”A few months later, Sandra, then 38 years old, disappeared.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHer StageFree monthly newsletterHear directly from incredible women from around the world on the issues that matter most to them – from the climate crisis to the arts to sportEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also say they were tailed by a red pickup truck. Friends told them it was not safe to stay in the town.On 8 October 2024, the government finally declared Sandra missing. And on 11 October, the family held a press conference in the city of Oaxaca to spread the word, and the case became national news.“It took off because this was the woman who had denounced the WhatsApp groups. And all of us realised that if we let them take one of us now, they could take any of us,” says Yésica Sánchez Maya, director of Consorcio Oaxaca, a feminist organisation.In Oaxaca, the family led marches and set upcamp outside the governor’s office. They wrote a public letter to president Claudia Sheinbaum, while Cruz herself later held a press conference in Mexico City. The UN and international human rights organisations called for urgent action from authorities.View image in fullscreenA march in Oaxaca on 16 October calling for action over Sandra’s disappearance.Photograph: Carolina Jimenez/CuartoscuroThe family have been critical of the investigation and when men on motorbikes began following them, taking photos, they felt they were being intimidated into silence.“If it happened like this with Sandra, just imagine what it is like with other victims of forced disappearance who aren’t so well known,” says Kisha.By the time thebodies were foundin late April this year, the decomposition was advanced. The authorities told them it might take months to prove it was really Sandra and her husband, by finding DNA they could extract, or analysing the teeth. Unable to bear the thought of waiting, Kisha, who is a dentist, did it herself.“They asked me not to, for the sake of my emotional and mental wellbeing,” says Kisha. “But my wellbeing went to hell long before that.”Devoted, dogged, defiant: the Mexican women who ‘sow the seeds of struggle’Read moreIn finding Sandra, the family says they have a bitter kind of closure that few families of the disappeared in Mexico find. “It’s not the way we wanted to find her,” they said in a press conference the day it was announced. “But now she is home.”Yet, they may never know for certain who killed the couple and why. The authorities have asserted that Sandra’s disappearance was related to organised crime, claiming that her husband, Hernández, 48, who disappeared alongside her, was a member of a criminal group.The family preferred not to comment on Sandra’s husband, but were furious about the implicit “criminalisation” of Sandra, and want the authorities to reconsider her activism as a line of investigation in her disappearance.View image in fullscreenOaxaca is the most dangerous state in Mexico for activists.Photograph: Maria Alferez/The GuardianOaxaca is the most dangerous state in Mexico for activists. Since 2018,58 people have been murdered and six moreare missing.In Mexico, about 2,500 women are murdered a year, but less than a third are categorised as femicides even whenthere is evidencethey should be. Less than a quarter of femicides are punished.Since Sandra was found, the family says they have had no update on the investigation. They want to continue speaking out, but are fearful: they say the tyres on their car have been slashed, and strangers sometimes take photos of their home.“But I’d like this to mark a before and after: for women to be able to speak up without being silenced,” says Kisha.Explore more on these topicsWomen's rights and gender equalityShe countsViolence against women and girlsFemicideMexicoAmericasActivismfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It said the then trustees’ failure to resolve disputes internally had “severely impacted the charity’s reputation and risked undermining public trust in charities more generally”.David Holdsworth, the chief executive of the Charity Commission, said: “Sentebale’s problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity’s reputation, risk[ing] overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising the charity’s ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve.“This case highlights what can happen when there are gaps in governance and policies critical to charities’ ability to deliver for their cause. As a result, we have issued the charity a Regulatory Action Plan to make needed improvements and rectify findings of mismanagement.”In response to the report, a spokesperson for Harry, who was not a trustee and established the charity in memory of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, criticised the commission, claiming its report had fallen “troublingly short”.The commission found that a serious dispute between Chandauka and Harry had followed the formulation of a new fundraising strategy in the US. The breakdown in the relationship had been raised with the commission in February but an investigation was only opened in April after an analysis.Accusations and resignations mark remarkable 24 hours at charity founded by Prince HarryRead moreThe commission did not find evidence of widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir, it said, but acknowledged “the strong perception of ill treatment felt by a number of parties to the dispute and the impact this may have had on them personally”.It further found no evidence of “‘overreach’ by either the chair or the Duke of Sussex as patron” but the commission was “critical of the charity’s lack of clarity in delegations to the chair which allowed for misunderstandings to occur”.It said: “The commission’s assessment of the various accounts that have been provided is that all the charity’s then trustees contributed to a missed opportunity to resolve issues which led to the dispute.“The regulator observed that strategic and financial difficulties that had emerged for the charity following the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to the tensions that arose.”A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said: “Unsurprisingly, the commission makes no findings of wrongdoing in relation to Sentebale’s co-founder and former patron, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.“They also found no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment or misogyny and misogynoir at the charity, as falsely claimed by the current chair.“Despite all that, their report falls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the fact that the consequences of the current chair’s actions will not be borne by her – but by the children who rely on Sentebale’s support.“Sentebale has been a deeply personal and transformative mission for Prince Harry, established to serve some of the most vulnerable children in Lesotho and Botswana.”A spokesperson for Sentebale said they were pleased with the action plan offered by the commission, which would allow it to “move forward … free from interference”.Chandauka said: “The unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviours displayed in private.“We are emerging not just grateful to have survived, but stronger: more focused, better governed, boldly ambitious and with our dignity intact.“Despite the recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our founders, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who established Sentebale in memory of their precious mothers, Princess Diana and Queen ‘Mamohato.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryAfricaCharitiesVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Thatdeal was scrappedafter the Conservative government that negotiated it lost last year’s general election.“Rwanda has agreed with the United States to accept up to 250 migrants,” a government spokesperson, Yolande Makolo, told AFP.Rwanda says talks underway with US to host deported migrantsRead moreShe said Rwanda would maintain “the ability to approve each individual proposed for resettlement”.Makolo said the government had agreed to the scheme with Washington because “nearly every Rwandan family has experienced the hardships of displacement”.Those who arrive in Rwanda will be provided with training, healthcare and accommodation, she added.No further information was given, including any indication of a timeline, with Makolo saying that Rwanda “will provide more details once these have been worked out”.Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has taken a number of actions aimed at speeding up deportations of undocumented migrants to countries that are not their own.His administration has defended third-country deportations as necessary, since the home nations of some of those targeted for removal sometimes refuse to accept them.But rights experts have warned that the deportations risk breaking international law by sending people to countries where they face the risk of torture, abduction and other abuses.South Sudan – which is teetering on the edge of renewed conflict –accepted eight people from the USin July. Its government said thegroup, only one of whom is South Sudanese, were in its care.Five other migrants labelled criminals by the US wereflown to Eswatini in Julyand incarcerated. The government later said they would be repatriated to their own countries.Rwanda, which is in Africa’s Great Lakes region, is home to 13 million people. Its government claims it is one of the most stable countries on the continent and it has drawn praise for its modern infrastructure.However, the migrant agreement with the UK government drew criticism from rights groups and faced a long-running legal challenge.President Paul Kagame’s government has frequently been accused of rampant human rights violations and crushing political dissent and press freedoms.It has also come under pressure over its role in the violence roiling the east of neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo.In June, theDRC and Rwanda signed a peace agreementaimed at ending decades of conflict in eastern DRC, where there were fresh clashes this year when the M23 armed group, backed by Rwandan troops, captured two major cities.Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationRwandaUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

She is the latest in a string foreign missionaries to become the victim of kidnapping in Haiti.Armed gangs have in recent years targeted a number of religious, charitable and medical aid groups, including hospitals, NGOs, nuns and priests from congregations based in and around the capital, as well as foreign missionaries.The majority of kidnapping victims are Haitian citizens who are seized and held for ransom, often picked opportunistically from the gridlocked traffic of the capital Port-au-Prince.More than 3,100 people were killed and 336 kidnapped for ransom in the first half of this year in Haiti, according to BINUH estimates, as the number of residents displaced by the extended conflict with the powerful gangs – largely grouped behind a coalition called Viv Ansanm, or “Live Together” – nearly doubled to 1.3 million.A recent report by the UN office inHaiti(BINUH) found the situation remained “very volatile” in Kenscoff while gangs intensified and expanded their attacks in central Haiti and the agricultural Artibonite region.BINUH considers Kenscoff of “major strategic importance” as it overlooks the suburb of Petion-Ville, one of the capital’s last hold-outs and the site of multiple embassies, banking institutions and hotels serving as diplomatic meeting places.‘Haitians are kidnapped every day’: missionary abductions shed light on growing crisisRead moreHaitian authorities have repeatedly called for more resources to fight the gangs.

The ensuing search captured headlines around the world for days as it evolved from a potentialrescue mission to a recovery operation.US Coast Guard investigatorsreleased their final reporton Tuesday. It spans more than 300 pages after a two-year investigation. What emerged was a scathing portrait of the company operating the Titan, OceanGate, and its chief executive, Stockton Rush, who was among those who died.Based on hearings involving more than two dozen people, including former employees, the report paints a picture of OceanGate as a company where employees were threatened with dismissal and belittled for raising concerns about safety. The result was a culture of downplaying, ignoring and even falsifying vital safety information to improve its reputation and evade scrutiny from regulators.“OceanGate’s toxic safety culture, corporate structure, and operational practices were critically flawed and at the core of these failures were glaring disparities between their written safety protocols and their actual practices,” the report said. “For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company’s favourable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny.”Investigators found the Titan’s design, certification, maintenance and inspection process were all inadequate.“This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,” said Jason Neubauer, the chair of the Coast Guard’s Marine Board of Investigation,in a statement.Employees told investigators Rush would often bypass established protocols and ignore the concerns of experienced employees and contractors.“The cumulative effect was an authoritarian and toxic culture where safety was not only deprioritised but actively suppressed,” the report said. “This toxic environment, characterised by retaliation and belittling against those who expressed safety concerns combined with a lack of external oversight, set the stage for the Titan’s ultimate demise.”The report cited mounting financial pressures in 2023 as being behind a decision made by OceanGate to store the Titan submersible outdoors over the Canadian winter. “During this time, the submersible was not covered or protected from the environmental elements, subjecting it to precipitation and repeated freeze-thaw cycles,” it said, likely leading to further degradation of the hull’s structural integrity.Investigators concluded Rush had “exhibited negligence” that contributed to the deaths of four people. Had Rush survived, the case would have likely ended up at the US Department of Justice and he might have been subjected to criminal charges, the report noted.In addition to Rush, the implosion killed the French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet, the British adventurer Hamish Harding and the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman.OceanGate wound down operations and focused its resources on cooperating with investigators, a company spokesperson said on Tuesday. In a statement, he added: “We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on 18 June 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy.”OceanGate began ferrying dozens of paying customers and researchers to thesite scattered with debris from the Titanic in 2021, characterising the voyages as part of an ambitious push to foster deep-sea tourism.Last year, the family of Nargeoletfiled a wrongful death lawsuitseeking more than $50m amid accusations that the “doomed submersible” had a “troubled history” and that OceanGate had failed to disclose crucial facts about the vessel and its durability.Neubauer was optimistic that the investigation would help to prevent future tragedies. “There is a need for stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework,” he said.That view was echoed by the Dawood family. “No report can alter the heartbreaking outcome, nor fill the immeasurable void left by two cherished members of our family,” they said in a statement. “We believe that accountability and regulatory change must follow such a catastrophic failure.”The hope was that the tragedy would be a turning point for the submersible industry, the family added. “If Shahzada and Suleman’s legacy can be a catalyst for regulatory change that helps prevent such a loss from ever happening again, it will bring us some measure of peace.”Explore more on these topicsTitanic sub incidentAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Detroit,New York CityandChicagocontinued to record some of the worst air quality in the world on Tuesday, according toIQAir, ranking fourth, 10th and 11th respectively.InCanada, Montreal and Toronto had seen significant improvements by Tuesday and no longer ranked in the top 20 for unhealthy air.How wildfire smoke across Canada and the US can affect mental healthRead moreAbout 81 million Americans remain under air quality alerts in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, northern Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Delaware and Maine, according to theNational Weather Service. It is expected to improve for most areas by Wednesday.A high-pressure system parked over the midwest is trapping the smoke in place, causing air quality issues to linger for several days, according to theMichigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.There are 747 active wildfires currently burning across Canada, with 507 – over two-thirds – of them out-of-control, according to theCanadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre(CIFFC), a non-profit organization that is owned by government agencies, including 165 in Manitoba, 134 in British Columbia, and 111 in Northwest Territories.Most of the current fires that are causing the poor, smoggy air quality and reduced visibility are connected to warmer-than-average temperatures, drought conditions, decreased levels of snowpack and low soil moisture, according to Natural Resources Canada. All of those factors are driven by global heating, NRC says.In the western US, ahuge wildfirein central California – the Gifford fire – has raged through 72,460 acres in the Los Padres national forest and is only 7%contained, threatening hundreds of homes and so far injuring three people. Firefighters have been battling the blaze, which grew out of several smaller fires that erupted along State Route 166, affecting Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, since Friday.A warming and drying trend was expected to continue from Wednesday through the weekend, with temperatures up to 90F to 100F (32C to 38C) on Thursday and Friday, with increasing fire behavior, officials said.Red flag warnings remain in place for parts of Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Wyoming due to very dry conditions, low humidity and gusty winds, with western fires creating smoky skies from Los Angeles to San Diego and to Las Vegas.Explore more on these topicsCanada wildfiresWildfiresCanadaUS weatherExtreme weatherAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Federal police claim the conspiracy included plans to assassinate Lula, his vice-president, Geraldo Alckmin, and Moraes. The plot allegedly culminated on 8 January 2023, a week after Lula took power, when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed congress, the supreme court and the presidential palace in what police claim was an unsuccessful attempt to start a military intervention.But Trump has claimed his ally – who is currently being tried by the supreme court – is the victim of a politically motivated “witch-hunt” and last week slappedMagnitsky sanctions on Moraes. The US president has also announced 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports from Wednesday. “This trial should not be taking place!” Trump wrote in a letter to Lula earlier this month calling Bolsonaro’s treatment “an international disgrace”.View image in fullscreenBolsonaro supporters in Brasília call for his release.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/The GuardianAfter Bolsonaro’s house arrest on Monday, the state department hinted that other members of Brazil’s 11-seat supreme court could soon face Magnitsky sanctions, which are normally used to punish the perpetrators of major human rights violations. “The United States condemns Moraes’ order imposing house arrest on Bolsonaro and will hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct,” it said.Trump’s attempt to interfere in Brazil’s justice system has outraged progressive Brazilians, who decry what they see as a flagrant violation of their country’s sovereignty. But the US president’s actions have exhilarated Bolsonaro’s sizeable support base, with Bolsonaristas hoping Trump’s intervention will help put pressure on congress to approve an amnesty that will ensure their leader avoids prosecution.View image in fullscreenSupporters protest in a car caravan on Monday, passing a giant screen announcing Bolsonaro’s house arrest.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/The GuardianBolsonaro, 70, is widely expected to be found guilty when the coup trial concludes in the coming weeks and faces spending the rest of his life in jail. He has repeatedly denied the charges but has admitted seeking “alternative” forms of remaining in power after losing the election.On Monday night, hundreds of followers flocked to the gates of Bolsonaro’s upmarket condominium to vent their anger, some carrying US flags.“We want Trump to help us,” said one protester, Ricardo, who wore a red Maga cap and declined to give his second name as he stood outside Bolsonaro’s compound holding up a star-spangled banner. “Our solution can no longer come from within [Brazil]. It has to come from abroad. The sanctions are working. More people need to be hit with Magnitsky.”Close allies of the former president were also present and vowed to launch a wave of demonstrations to protest against their leader’s plight.View image in fullscreenA woman shows her support for the former president.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/The Guardian“What they are doing to President Bolsonaro is an outrage,” the ex-president’s brother-in-law, Eduardo Torres, said. He described Bolsonaro as “a hostage”. He added: “We will occupy [the streets] and we will bring Brazil to a standstill if that’s what we need to do to defend our freedom.”Lenildo Mendes dos Santos Sertão, a brawny Amazonian congressman who goes by the nickname Delegado Caveira (“Police chief Skull”), said he believed Bolsonaro’s political future could still be salvaged.“I spoke with him yesterday. He’s very shaken. Very downcast. But he’s a soldier and he is in the trenches and at the right time he will come out and we really believe that he will be our candidate in the presidential election,” Caveira said, as he marched towards the entrance to the compound Bolsonaro can no longer leave.Another pro-Bolsonaro lawmaker, Maurício Souza, called on truck drivers, entrepreneurs and members of the agribusiness community to stage a nationwide strike against the supreme court’s “tyranny”. “Brazil is going to grind to a halt,” Souza told reporters.Explore more on these topicsJair BolsonaroBrazilUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The sunflower sea star is on the International Union forConservationof Nature’s red list of critically endangered species.Previous studies had tested forVpectenicidain tissue samples and yielded inconclusive results. Instead, by examining the sea stars’ coelomic fluid, which acts like blood, researchers were able to confirm with certaintyVpectenicida’s role in causing SSWD due to its high abundance there.View image in fullscreenA sunflower sea star reduced to goo by sea star wasting disease at Calvert Island, British Columbia, Canada, in 2015.Photograph: Grant Callegari/Hakai Institute/APInfection with theVpectenicidastrain FHCF-3 begins with exterior lesions, leading to limb loss and contortion, and ultimately kills afflicted individuals by melting their tissues into a white, mucus-like paste. Identifying the disease in afflicted sea stars was impossible without a known pathogen, as sea stars can respond with similar visual signals to other stressors such as low oxygen, salinity variation and extreme heat. The indirect link between rising ocean temperatures and SSWD remains a key area of interest, sinceVpectenicidais known to proliferate in warm water during seasonal variations and anomalous marine heating events.The research,published this weekin the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, was led by Dr Melanie Prentice and Dr Alyssa Gehman, of the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, as part of a four-year international collaboration involving the University of British Columbia, the University of Washington and the Nature Conservancy, among other parties.The decline of sunflower sea stars has ramifications for marine ecosystems beyond the loss of a single species. “Identifying the cause of SSWD is incredibly impactful,” Prentice said. “In the absence of sunflower stars, [kelp-eating] sea urchin populations increase, which means the loss of kelp forests, and that has broad implications for all the other marine species and humans that rely on them.”View image in fullscreenWithout predatory sunflower sea stars, sea urchins proliferate in Hakai Pass, British Columbia, Canada, in 2019.Photograph: Grant Callegari/Hakai Institute/APKelp forests provide a habitat for thousands of marine creatures, support local economies through fisheries and recreation, and are culturally important for First Nations and tribal communities. They also stabilise sediments, protect coastlines from storms, and are an important carbon sink for sequestering carbon dioxide.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

The beating, which took place last month and caused multiple bruises to Lai’s scalp and knees, was filmed by bystanders who shared it online, police said.The onlookers and a third girl who participated in the abuse were “criticised and educated”, police said, adding that their guardians had been “ordered to exercise strict discipline”.The case drew outrage online from some lamenting that the teenagers’ punishment did not go further.Later on Monday, people gathered outside the city hall in Jiangyou, in Sichuan province, with large crowds stretching around the block, footage showed.Video confirmed as having been shot outside the city hall showed at least two people being forcibly pulled aside by a group of blue-shirted and plainclothes police, and a woman in a black dress being dragged away by her limbs.“They’re sweeping away citizens everywhere,” a person can be heard saying as the woman is dragged away.More footage taken after dark showed police wearing black Swat uniforms subduing at least three people at an intersection where there were hundreds of bystanders.In a video posted online by the YouTube account Yesterday BigCat, which shares content about protests inChina, one protester angrily quotes one of the alleged attackers, who is reported to have boasted about being apprehended but then released by police several times in the past.On Tuesday, the city of Jiangyou was the second top-trending topic on the Weibo social media platform, before it and related hashtags were censored.“The sentence is too light … that is why they were so arrogant,” one top-liked Weibo comment under the police statement read.Local authorities said on WeChat that police had punished two people for fabricating information about the school bullying case, and they warned the public against spreading rumours.In recent years, protests led by parents or triggered out of concerns for child safety have become increasingly common. In 2023, thousands of people protested in Shangqiu, a city in Henan province, after the death of a 14-year-old student. The boy’s school said he had died by suicide, but his parents said that his body showed signs of physical abuse and said that he had been attacked.Last year Chinese authorities vowed to crack down on school bullying after a high-profilemurder case. In December, a court sentenced a teenage boy to life in prison for murdering his classmate.The suspects, all aged under 14 at the time of the murder, were accused of bullying a 13-year-old classmate over a long period before killing him in an abandoned greenhouse.Another boy was given 12 years in prison, while a third, who the court found did not harm the victim, was sentenced to correctional education.With Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Mongooses, which feed on cobras, are one such example.The researchers showed that the Australian major skink,Bellatorias frerei,had the same mutation that gave the honey badger its resistance to cobra venom.The researchers looked at 47 skink species and found that 13 of these were resistant to snake venom.Of these 13 species, some had multiple types of resistance, leading the researchers to discover that the skinks had developed independent mutations conferring resistance on 25 occasions.Fry said the researchers had used tissue banks from museums across Australia rather than testing venom on live skinks.A study co-author and UQ researcher, Dr Uthpala Chandrasekara, said: “We used synthetic peptides and receptor models to mimic what happens when venom enters an animal at the molecular level and the data was crystal clear, some of the modified receptors simply didn’t respond at all.”“It’s fascinating to think that one tiny change in a protein can mean the difference between life and death when facing a highly venomous predator.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She said reforms were needed as soon as possible.Attacks on the humanities at Australian universities are not new – but they are now more lethal | Julianne SchultzRead more“I would hate to see the scheme becoming too entrenched,” Garland said. “It’s really clear from my community that they want the government to act on the current job-ready graduates scheme, and it should happen sooner rather than later.“The [universities] accordwas pretty clear in its assessment and the minister has said we will move progressively to implement the recommendations. I’ve advocated for change [directly] to the minister’s office and will continue to do so.”The scheme, introduced in 2021, changed the fee structure for university courses to increase costs for subjects including arts and law, and lowered course fees for degrees in Stem areas. The scheme also introduced a rule to remove Hecs debt eligibility for students who failed more than 50% of their units.Labor commissioned the universities accord to outline a reform path across the entire sector, which made several key findings on the JRG scheme.In July 2023 the accord released its interim report, which found the fee structure needed to be “redesigned before it causes long-term damage to Australian higher education by increasing the cost of gaining a qualification”, and recommended the 50% pass rule should be scrapped.Labor immediately abolished the 50% pass rule, and later established the Australian Tertiary Education Commission (Atec) to make recommendations on changing the fee structure under the scheme.The education minister, Jason Clare, has provided no timeline on when Atec, which has been in place since 1 July, will make its recommendations.Clare said the accord had “made a number of recommendations and called out the previous government’s job-ready graduates program as a failure”.“We’ve bitten off a big chunk of its recommendations already – 31 of 47 in full or in part. This includes changes to makethe repayment system for Hecsfairer, which we passed through parliament last week,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You’re not actually going to be able to get a job.’ I do genuinely think that sort of stigma turns students away from studying things,” Walker said.“I really hope we can start moving past that.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian educationAustralian universitiesAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The northern and southern zones suffered the highest annual drops on record.Coral cover fell by 13% in the central section, which had escaped the worst of the heat in 2024.Dr Mike Emslie, who leads the long-term reef monitoring program at Aims, said coral cover was becoming more volatile. “It has been a pretty sobering year of surveys with the biggest impacts I have seen in the 30-plus years I have been doing this,” he said.“This volatility is very likely a sign of an unstable system. That’s our real concern. We’re starting to see record highs in coral cover that quickly get turned around to record falls.”Quick GuideWhat is coral bleaching?ShowCoral bleaching describes a process whereby the coral animal expels the algae that live in its tissues and give it its colour and much of its nutrients.Without its algae, a coral’s white skeleton can be seen through its translucent flesh, giving off a bleached appearance.Mass coral bleaching over large areas, first noticed in the 1980s around the Caribbean, is caused by rising ocean temperatures.Some corals also display fluorescent colours under stress when they release a pigment that filters light. Sunlight also plays a role in triggering bleaching.Corals can survive bleaching if temperatures are not too extreme or prolonged. But extreme marine heatwaves can kill corals outright.Coral bleaching can also have sub-lethal effects, including increased susceptibility to disease and reduced rates of growth and reproduction.Scientists say the gaps between bleaching events are becoming too short to allow reefs to recover.Coral reefs are considered one of the planet’s ecosystems most at risk from global heating. Reefs support fisheries that feed hundreds of millions of people, as well as supporting major tourism industries.The world’s biggest coral reef system – Australia’s Great Barrier Reef – has suffered seven mass bleaching events since 1998, of which five were in the past decade.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With relatively benign impacts from cyclones and bleaching in the five years before the 2024 event, coral cover had reached record levels in some places.But that recovery, Emslie said, was largely driven by fast-growingacroporacorals that were more susceptible to heat stress.“We had said it could all get turned around in one year and, low and behold, here we are,” he said, adding that coral cover was now mostly back in line with long-term averages.‘Closer and closer’The 2024 and 2025 events werepart of an ongoing global mass coral bleaching eventthat led to more than 80% of the planet’s reefs being hit with enough heat to cause bleaching, affecting corals in at least 82 countries and territories.A study last year foundocean temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef were probably at their hottest for at least 400 yearsand were an “existential threat” to the Unesco world heritage-listed reef.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His colleagues also used AI in their daily work, he said.Kristersson told the Swedish business newspaper Dagens industri: “I use it myself quite often. If for nothing else than for a second opinion. What have others done? And should we think the complete opposite? Those types of questions.”Tech experts, however, have raised concerns about politicians using AI tools in such a way, and the Aftonbladet newspaper accused Kristersson in a editorial of having “fallen for the oligarchs’ AI psychosis”.“You have to be very careful,” Simone Fischer-Hübner, a computer science researcher at Karlstad University, told Aftonbladet, warning against using ChatGPT to work with sensitive information.Kristersson’s spokesperson, Tom Samuelsson, later said the prime minister did not take risks in his use of AI. “Naturally it is not security sensitive information that ends up there. It is used more as a ballpark,” he said.But Virginia Dignum, a professor of responsible artificial intelligence at Umeå University, said AI was not capable of giving a meaningful opinion on political ideas, and that it simply reflects the views of those who built it.“The more he relies on AI for simple things, the bigger the risk of an overconfidence in the system. It is a slippery slope,” she told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper. “We must demand that reliability can be guaranteed.

They were also denied food, water, showers and changes of clothes.The doctors detained in Gaza: ‘He was dragged from the operating theatre’ – podcastRead moreLebanon’s ministry of public health has found that between 8 October 2023 and 27 January 2025, 217 healthcare workers were killed by the Israel Defense Forces, 177 ambulances were damaged, and 68 attacks on hospitals were recorded.Figuresfrom the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition recorded 3,623 attacks on or obstruction of healthcare in 2024, the highest number ever documented.These attacks included doctors, nurses and allied healthcare professionals who were beaten, arbitrarily arrested, kidnapped, tortured and killed; patients shot in their beds or dragged to detention centres; and hospitals that were deliberately bombed and raided.The authors of the BMJ article are calling on doctors to “forsake the principle of medical neutrality” and speak out against “healthocide” or face emboldening future violators. This might include advocating for enforcement of justice and international humanitarian law, and documenting and exposing abuses of medical neutrality.Writing in theGuardian, Maarten van der Heijden, a global health lawyer and researcher at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, noted that the international humanitarian laws, theGeneva conventions, leave “considerable room for interpretation and forgoes accountability”, allowing hospitals to be bombed if it is considered “harmful to the enemy”.The British Medical Association’s medical ethics committee chair, Dr Andrew Green, said: “In recent years, doctors have been devastated to see the appalling increase in attacks on healthcare, patients and staff in conflict zones, and the disregard for medical neutrality and international humanitarian law.”He noted that although there were examples around the world, Gaza was the most severe given that “the population is both at risk of imminent famine, while health systems necessary to look after the starving have been systematically obliterated and health workers killed and arbitrarily detained.”He urged international medical associations, NGOs, governments and the UN to “call out when we see human and health rights abused, and hold those breaking international humanitarian law accountable”.“Those with power must use all levers at their disposal to ensure the provision of humanitarian aid and urgent healthcare to the world’s most vulnerable. One clear step would be the establishment of a UN special rapporteur on the protection of health in armed conflict,” he added.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office ministerHamish Falconer has previously saidthat the UK government is urging the Israeli authorities to ensure that “incidents are investigated transparently and that those responsible are held to account and lessons learned”.Explore more on these topicsGazaPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warHospitalsDoctorsInternational lawnewsShareReuse this content"

They were also informed the couple had beentransferred to separate Iranian prisonsin and near Tehran.“To hear your mum’s voice after so long, your rock, your guide, someone you’ve missed more than you can even express, it’s like five birthdays and 10 Christmases all at once,” said Lindsay’s son, Joe Bennett.View image in fullscreenJoe Bennett, Lindsay Foreman’s son.Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images“I’ll be replaying that call in my head over and over again. It reminded me of what really matters: love, connection, and knowing they’re still with us.”Bennett, 31, said it was difficult to put the eight-minute phone call on Tuesday morning into words. They shared tears and laughs, and for a moment it felt as though the weight of the past seven months had been lifted, he said.While the family said the phone calls provided joy and relief, they continue to urge the government to secure the couple’s release. The couple have received calls from British embassy officials, but their family said they should be allowed to receive consular and medical visits.The family learned on Monday that Lindsay had been transferred to Qarchak women’s prison, south of Tehran. Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised the dire conditions reported there.Bennett said his mother sounded in good spirits, and described the prison conditions as OK and hot. She has befriended those in prison with her and asked that they try to send her some literature beyond the children’s books available. They shared a laugh, he said, when his mother recalled being transferred to the prison on a plane and Bennett joked that “it was like something out of a movie”.“I know that potentially the call is monitored but I heard in her voice that she is doing mentally OK,” said Bennett. “Both her and Craig, they seemed both mentally strong.”Craig has been moved to Tehran’s central prison, also known as Fashafouyeh, which is about 30km (18 miles) south of the capital and has similar notoriety.The confirmation of the couple’s location and the first phone call since their incarceration came a month after the family’s first public plea for the British government to raise the couple’s case at thehighest levels in negotiations with Iran.The couple have been charged with espionage after entering Iran from Armenia. They said they had intended to stay for only four days before crossing into Pakistan. The family have called the charges against them baseless.“They are not spies. The British government knows they are not spies. It must say so publicly, unequivocally and immediately,” Bennett said.A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.”Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaForeign policynewsShareReuse this content"

A patchwork of concrete shapes and shattered walls, neighbourhoods scattered with craters, rubble and roads that lead nowhere. The remnants of cities wiped out.But here, there has been no natural disaster and no slow passage of time.Gaza was a bustling, living place until less than two years ago, for all the challenges its residents endured even then. Its markets were crowded, its streets were full of children. That Gaza is gone – not buried under volcanic ash, not erased by history, but razed by an Israeli military campaign that has left behind a place that looks like the aftermath of an apocalypse.View image in fullscreenMembers of Jordan’s military stand among pallets of aid about to be dropped on GazaThe Guardian was granted permission on Tuesday to travel onboard a Jordanian military aircraft providing aid. Israel announced last week that it had resumed coordinated humanitarian airdrops over Gaza, following mounting international pressure over severe shortages of food and medical supplies, which has reached such a crisis point that a famine is now unfolding there.The flight offered not only a chance to witness three tonnes of aid – far from sufficient – dropped over the famine-stricken strip but also a rare opportunity to observe, albeit from above, a territory that has been largely sealed off from the international media since 7 October and the subsequent offensive launched by Israel. Following the Hamas-led attacks that day, Israel barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been denied access to an active war zone.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenGaza Strip from the aid plane; view of northern Gaza; the distortion in the last picture is due to the heat emitted by the aircraft enginesEven from an altitude of about 2,000ft (600 metres), it was possible to glimpse places that mark some of the conflict’s most devastating chapters – a landscape etched with the scars of its deadliest attacks.These are the sites of bombings and sieges that have been courageously documented by Palestinian journalists – often at the cost of their own lives. More than 230 Palestinian reporters lie buried beneath in hastily dug cemeteries.View image in fullscreenAirdrops released from the planeAbout an hour and a half after takeoff, the plane flies over the ruins of northern Gaza and Gaza City, now a wasteland of crumbling concrete and dust. Buildings are reduced to rubble, roadways pitted with craters, entire neighbourhoods flattened. From this distance it is nearly impossible to see Gaza’s inhabitants. Only through a nearly-400mm camera lens is it possible to make out a small group of people standing among the ruins of a shattered landscape – the only sign of life in a place that appears otherwise uninhabitable.As the aircraft approaches the Nuseirat refugee camp, the rear hatch opens and pallets of aid slide out, parachutes blooming behind as they fall toward the ground.Aid is released during the airdrop.Aid is released during the airdrop.“With today’s airdrops, the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army has now conducted 140 airdrop operations, in addition to 293 in cooperation with other countries, delivering 325 tonnes of aid to Gaza since the resumption of airdrops on 27 July,” a note from the Jordanian military reads.Yet such quantities are nowhere close to being enough. Humanitarian agencies warn that hunger is spreading rapidly through the territory. While airdrops can create the perception that something is being done, they are, by common consensus, costly, inefficient and do not get anywhere near to the amount of aid that could be delivered by lorries. In the first 21 months of war, 104 days of airdrops supplied the equivalent of just four days of food for Gaza,Israeli data shows.Graphic showing quantity of aid airdropped into Gaza in 2023-24They can also be deadly; at least 12 people drowned last year trying to recover food that landed in the sea, and at least five were killed when pallets fell on them.Farther south, the plane passes over Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. There, in the Baraka area below, on 22 May, 11-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, known asGaza’s youngest social media influencer, was killed after a series of heavy Israeli airstrikes hit her house while she watered flowers in a tiny patch of greenery eked out of a displacement camp.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenPallets parachute down after being dropped from a military plane over NuseiratA couple of kilometres further, the aircraft flies near Khan Younis, besieged for months by Israeli forces amid fierce fighting in and around its hospitals. Somewhere in the northern suburbs are the remains of the home of Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a Palestinian paediatrician who worked at al-Tahrir hospital, part of the Nasser medical complex.Her house was bombed in Maywhile she was on shift. Her husband and nine of her 10 children were killed in the attack.From the skies, it is striking just how small Gaza is – a sliver of land that has become the stage for one of the world’s bloodiest conflicts. The territory is more than four times smaller than Greater London. In this tiny corner of the Middle East, more than 60,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, according to health authorities. Thousands more are estimated to remain buried under the rubble.1:10Gaza before and after: new video shows extent of Israel's destruction – videoA few hundred metres beneath us, the Guardian reporter Malak A Tantesh, a journalist and a survivor, works on one of her dispatches. Most of her fellow reporters, editors and other colleagues are yet to meet Tantesh, owing to the Israeli blockade that makes it impossible for Gaza’s people to leave. She has been displaced multiple times, lives without reliable access to food or water, and has lost relatives, friends and her home in the fighting. It is a strange and haunting feeling to receive a message from her as the Jordanian aircraft flies above.Map illustrating flight pathAs our aircraft turns back toward Jordan, a soldier onboard points toward the hazy horizon to the south. “That’s Rafah down there,” he says.Gaza’s southernmost area, Rafah is a region now largely destroyed, where hundreds have died in the scramble for food since the Israeli- and US-backedGaza Humanitarian Foundationtook over food deliveries in May. Just a few kilometres to the east, amid crater-pocked hills, lies the site where, on 23 March, an Israeli military unit struck a convoy of Palestinian emergency vehicles,killing 15 medics and rescue workerswho were later buried in a mass grave.After touching down at Jordan’s King Abdullah II airbase in Ghabawi, the same question seems to linger among the handful of reporters who boarded the flight: when will we see Gaza again?And after seeing this desert of shattered stones and graves, what more can be destroyed when so much has already been lost?View image in fullscreenPalestinians rush to collect humanitarian aid airdropped by the United Arab Emirates into Deir al-BalahExplore more on these topicsGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

That’s going to be pretty much up to Israel.”Late on Tuesday, a senior UN official warned that expanding Israeli military operations inside the territory “would risk catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians and could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza”.Addressing the UN security council in New York, Miroslav Jenča, the assistant secretary general for Europe, central Asia and the Americas, said: “There is no military solution to the conflict in Gaza or the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict.”China’s deputy UN representative, Geng Shuang, expressed “great concern” about the reported plans for Gaza and added: “We urge Israel to immediately halt such dangerous actions.” He called for a ceasefire and urged countries with influence to take concrete steps to help bring one about.‘Heartbreaking’: a London surgeon on the trials of operating in a Gaza hospitalRead moreIsrael’s scorched-earth campaign has obliterated large parts of Gaza, killed more than 60,000 people, mostly civilians, forced nearly all of Gaza’s more than 2 million people from their homes and created what a global hunger monitor last week called an unfolding famine.That has caused widespread international anger and prompted several European countries to say they wouldrecognise a Palestinian state next monthif there was no ceasefire, amid mounting calls for sanctions against Israel.The disquiet follows briefings to Israeli journalists on Monday saying that Netanyahu had decided the expanded offensive was a foregone conclusion.“The die has been cast. We’re going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip – and defeating Hamas,” the unnamed sources said, quoting Netanyahu.View image in fullscreenPalestinians rush to collect humanitarian aid airdropped by parachutes into Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, on Tuesday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APBy Tuesday, however, evidence had emerged of deep splits between Netanyahu and senior military officials, including the chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, who reportedly voiced opposition to the plan, prompting calls for his dismissal.Absent at a security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu did, however, meet security officials, but not in a decision-making setting. His office said later that the Israeli military would carry out any decision made in cabinet.During a visit to an army training facility earlier on Tuesday, Netanyahu said: “It is necessary to complete the defeat of the enemy in Gaza, to free all our hostages and to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.”Military analysts in the Israeli media, channelling some defence officials, were also sceptical. Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, the military affairs commentator Yossi Yehoshua described the risks of the proposal. “Hostages … will die, large numbers of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers will be killed as well as a serious logistical problem – where to house the roughly 1 million civilians who are now in Gaza City.“Currently, Israel simply doesn’t have legitimacy either to continue to fight in Gaza or to establish a city of refugees on its ruins.”Israeli officials have said Netanyahu discussed a plan with the White House as it attempted toportray Hamas as having walked away from ceasefire negotiations, a claim denied by Hamas, which blamed Israel for the protracted impasse.While the Trump administration has not commented on the Netanyahu proposal, it has been given some credence by leaked comments made by the US envoy Steve Witkoff to Israeli hostage families at the weekend, suggesting his proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for the release of half of the remaining living hostages had failed.Witkoff added that Donald Trump “now believes that everybody should come home at once. No piecemeal deals,” adding they were now pursuing an “all or nothing” plan.0:45At least 40 arrested at protest against Gaza war at Trump hotel in New York – videoAt the centre of the Netanyahu plan is the notion that, by surrounding areas where hostages are believed to be held, Israeli forces can raid those areas and rescue the captives, a policy that has broadly failed during the past two years of war.Amid questions over the practicality of a wider offensive, some have speculated that Netanyahu’s call may be more rhetorical than real in substance, aimed at keeping onboard far-right ministers who have demanded they be allowed to build settlements in Gaza.A Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the negotiation table.“It will only complicate the negotiation further, at the end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and a full withdrawal from Gaza,” the official told Reuters, requesting not to be named.Practically, too, it is unclear whether Israel has the capacity for the kind of expanded operation described.The IDF has struggled with manpower issues as the war drags on, with reservists being repeatedly called up amid concerns over a mental health crisis that has included a number of suicides.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We pray for their safety.”The Uttarakhand state chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said rescue teams had been deployed “on a war footing”.mapA senior local official, Prashant Arya, said four people had been killed, with other officials saying that the number could rise.India’s army said 150 troops had reached the town, helping to rescue about 20 people who had survived the wall of freezing sludge. “A massive mudslide struck Dharali … triggering a sudden flow of debris and water through the settlement,” the army said.Images released by the army, taken from the site after the main torrent had passed, showed a river of slow-moving mud.A swathe of the town was swamped by deep debris. In places, the mud lapped at the rooftops of houses.“Search and rescue efforts are ongoing, with all available resources being deployed to locate and evacuate any remaining stranded persons,” an army spokesperson, Suneel Bartwal, said.The prime minister, Narendra Modi, expressed his condolences, and said that “no stone is being left unturned in providing assistance”.Dhami said the flood was caused by a sudden and intense “cloudburst”, calling the destruction “extremely sad and distressing”.The India Meteorological Department issued a red alert warning for the area, saying it had recorded “extremely heavy” rainfall of about 21cm (8in) in isolated parts of Uttarakhand.Deadly floods and landslides are common during the monsoon season from June to September, but experts say the climate crisis, coupled with urbanisation, is increasing their frequency and severity.The UN’s World Meteorological Organization said last year that more intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” for what is to come as climate breakdown makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaExtreme weatherClimate crisisFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

It means if the chancellor wants to maintain a buffer of £9.9bn then she will have to find £51.1bn, either in extra taxes or lower spending or both, annually, by 2029-30.”He said NIESR recommended a bigger buffer. “To do that requires a moderate but sustained increase in taxes.”Last month the chancellor warned ministers that taxes would have to rise after the government scrapped restrictions on welfare payments, without indicating which taxes would be affected.There is already a long queue of claims by public sector workers for higher wage rises, adding to already rising pressures on the public purse that includes higher spending on immigration and the courts system to defence and education.Backbench Labour MPs, emboldened after successful campaigns against cuts to winter fuel allowance and disability support payments, are expected to challenge the Labour leadership if manifesto spending pledges are scrapped in the budget to reduce the deficit.NIESR said its updated analysis from the spring meant it expected the Bank of England to reduce the cost of borrowing from 4.25% to 3.75% by the end of the year, but the cuts will arrive too late to boost growth.Speculation has mounted over which taxes Reeves will raise, with current favourites anextension to the freeze on income tax bands and a cut to the current cash Isa limit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This will require a determined attempt to rebuild the fiscal buffer and that will inevitably involve gradual but sustained tax increases or spending cuts.”A projection by the Office forBudgetResponsibility (OBR), the government independent forecaster, to coincide with the chancellor’s spring statement in March showed the deficit falling in the 2025-26 financial year.However, official figures have shown public finances already beginning to veer off track since April. Across the first three months of fiscal year 2025-2026, the budget deficit was £44.5bn, £5bn higher than the OBR’s forecast.A Conservative spokesperson, Mel Stride, blamed the government for mismanaging the economy and “always reaching for the tax rise lever because they don’t understand the economy”.He said: “Businesses are closing, unemployment is up, inflation has doubled and the economy is shrinking. And Labour are refusing to rule out more damaging tax rises on investment.”Explore more on these topicsTax and spendingRachel ReevesEconomic policyLabourBudgetThinktanksIncome taxnewsShareReuse this content"

Of those surveyed, 41% mentioned finding more plastic items (including plastic cups, bottle caps/lids, microplastics), including 19% more vapes, 26% more fishing litter (including lines/nets), 11% more dog poo bags and 11% more wet wipes.But there were some positive findings that demonstrated how good policy can make a difference. Volunteers on the beach cleans log every piece of litter they find so that a comprehensive dataset of rubbish on beaches can be built up and trends observed.Their research found that the number plastic bags littered on beaches reduced by 80% between 2015 and 2024, after a charge on carrier bags was introduced. The MCS says this shows that policy changes can quickly make a positive difference to the amount of pollution in the environment.Summer is a bad time for litter on UK beaches. Seventy-four per cent of MCS volunteers said they found an increase in beach litter during the summer, compared with winter months, due to increased visitor numbers plus a gap in public awareness around environmental impacts.Volunteers who take part in the litter pick have asked local authorities and governments in the UK to build better infrastructure including more accessible bins on beaches.Litter pickers said the problem was widespread and harming wildlife. Violet Fraser, who has been cleaning beaches on the Western Isles in Scotland, said she had found birds’ nests with plastic in, while Colette Edwards in Norfolk reported regularly finding seals caught in discarded nets on her local beach.Plastic is a particular scourge on beaches as it does not biodegrade, instead breaking down into microplastics that stay in the environment indefinitely, and these are easilyingested by marine animalsand can cause illness andeven death.A spokesperson for the MCS said: “The amount of plastic found on beaches increased by 9.5% between 2023 and 2024. The continued presence of plastics on our coastline highlights the need for a circular economy in which consumers have more options and access to use refillable and reusable products.“Beachwatch data has already been used by governments across the UK as evidence to introduce litter reducing policy – such as the carrier bag charges and bans on certain single-use plastics, such as straws, cutlery, plates and bowls, and the recent UK-wide commitment to ban plastic wet wipes.”Isaac Kenyon, a volunteer, said: “There’s something deeply grounding about standing on a shoreline and knowing that your small actions are part of something much bigger. Every piece of litter picked up is one less hazard for wildlife, one less piece of plastic in the ocean, and one small step toward a healthier planet.”TheGreat British Beach Cleanruns from 19-28 September.Explore more on these topicsPlasticsPollutionWastenewsShareReuse this content"

The prevalence of low mental wellbeing for those who had experienced no abuse stood at 16%, rising to 22.5% for physical abuse, 24% for verbal abuse, and 29% for both physical and verbal abuse.Furthermore, the prevalence of physical abuse halved from about 20% among those born between 1950 and 1979 to 10% among participants born in or after 2000. However, for verbal abuse, the prevalence increased from 12% among those born before 1950 to about 20% among those born in 2000 or later.These findings add to previous research that found experiencing childhood verbal abuse waslinked to a higher risk of self-harm, drug use, and ending up in jail.“Our study reveals that degrading, humiliating and abusive language directed at children can have long-term mental health impacts at least as severe as those associated with physical abuse,” said Prof Mark Bellis of Liverpool John Moores University, the study’s lead author.“Equally concerning is the trend observed over the study period where physical abuse declined but verbal abuse increased … potentially offsetting the mental health gains we might expect from reduced exposure to physical harm.”The authors of the study acknowledged its limitations, namely that they were unable to measure the severity of either type of abuse, or the reasons for these trends in changing prevalence for physical and verbal abuse.“Although this study does not examine the reasons for these trends, it is vital that we do not simply replace one form of childhood trauma with another,” Bellis added. “That’s why we must go beyond telling parents what not to do, and instead offer clear, practical support and guidance that allows them to raise their children through healthy, nurturing relationships.”The analysis also found that participants born in 2000 or later had a higher likelihood of overall low mental wellbeing, while men were more likely to report never or rarely feeling optimistic, useful, or close to people, while women were more likely to report never or rarely feeling relaxed.Jessica Bondy, founder of Words Matter, a charity with the aim of ending childhood verbal abuse, said the study confirmed that “words can wound deeply and have a lasting impact on a child’s mental health and development”.She added: “Any gains made in reducing physical abuse risk being undone by rising rates of verbal abuse. We must act now to confront the lasting harm caused by cruel, critical or controlling language. We need to build children up – not knock them down. The mental health of the next generation and our shared future depend on it.”Explore more on these topicsChildrenChild protectionParents and parentingFamilyResearchMental healthnewsShareReuse this content"

It will be spent on improving youth club infrastructure, including new gym equipment and climbing walls, in areas with high levels of child poverty and support youth work in areas with high rates of antisocial behaviour.The funds will also support local authorities to provide high-quality out-of-school activities and create thousands of places in youth organisations such as the Scouts, the Guides and the Volunteer Police Cadets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He told the BBC that the series shone a light “on misogyny, on online content, and this sense of children, particularly boys, getting drawn into this world”.Ministers are preparing to publish a national youth strategy in the autumn.

The videos, which have drawn thousands of complaints on Reddit and X, mislead users into thinking they are receiving financial advice from a trusted source.Other viewers have reported false product claims, scam diet pills and fake competitions. In one Reddit thread users reported being targeted with ads impersonating UK media figures or pretending to offer government-backed grants, with little clarity over how to report or block such content.YouTube adverts fall under the sameAdvertisingStandards Authority (ASA) rules as TV, but unlike broadcasters, there is no pre-approval, real-time scrutiny or independent enforcement unless someone complains.The ASA has previously warned of a rise in “celebrity deepfake” and “impersonation” scams on online platforms, particularly for financial services. The lack of mandatory pre-approval or independent enforcement means that many of these adverts remain online for days before action is taken, if any is.Max Wilkinson, the Liberal Democrats’ spokesperson for culture, media and sport, said the system leaves the public exposed. “We cannot allow a two-tier system where traditional broadcasters face robust scrutiny, while a digital giant like YouTube is allowed to mark its own homework,” he said.The party is calling for YouTube advertising to be brought into line with the system used for TV and radio, including tougher oversight, clearer accountability, and the power for Ofcom to levy fines on platforms that repeatedly allow harmful or misleading ads. It also wants revenues from those fines used to support victims of online scams.YouTube ads are served through Google Ads and are regulated under a voluntary framework created by the tech industry. This contrasts with the ASA’s co-regulatory model for broadcast advertising, where Ofcom retains backstop powers and many adverts must be pre-cleared before airing.Privately, some Labour MPs acknowledge that online ad regulation is “behind the curve”, but there is little appetite for major change. Others have warned that new restrictions could make it harder to target voters aged under 35, many of whom are disengaged from traditional media.Last month the Guardianrevealed that Ofcom is preparing to push for new legal powersto require platforms like YouTube to give greater prominence to public service content, amid concerns that trusted news, children’s programming and UK-produced shows are becoming “invisible” to younger viewers.The Lib Dems argue that the same logic should apply to advertising, especially given the rise in misleading financial content and impersonation scams.“YouTube is no longer a niche platform – it’s one of the main ways people of all ages consume news, entertainment and information,” said Wilkinson. “The government needs to act now to ensure that consumers are properly protected.”A YouTube spokesperson said: “YouTube is not a broadcaster and it should not be regulated like one.“We have strict policies that govern the ads on our platform which we enforce rigorously. When we find ads that breach our policies we take immediate action, including removing the ads and suspending the account when necessary.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeAdvertisingLiberal DemocratsDeepfakeArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

Earlier on Tuesday, Texas Democrats denied a legislative quorum for the second day in a row by scattering across the country, with many decamping to Chicago, Illinois, where the Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, has vowed to protect them.In a letter to the FBI director, Kash Patel, Cornyn, a Republican, said “federal resources are necessary to locate the out-of-stateTexaslegislators who are potentially acting in violation of the law”.2:23Texas house remains without quorum amid redistricting standoff – videoThe FBI declined to comment on the senator’s request to involve its agents.Ken Paxton, the state’s Republican attorney general, announced what experts say is likely alongshot bidto convince a court to declare the seats of “any rogue lawmakers” vacant if they do not return to work at the statehouse by Friday.“The people of Texas elected lawmakers, not jet-setting runaways looking for headlines,” Paxton, the long-embattled Trump loyalist challenging Cornyn for the Republican Senate nomination, said in a statement. “If you don’t show up to work, you get fired.”On Tuesday evening, Texas’s Republican governor,Greg Abbott, announced that he hadfiledan emergency petition with the state supreme court seeking to remove from office state representative Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic caucus who has sought refuge in Illinois.“Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences,” Abbott said in a statement.Responding to the governor’s petition from Chicago, Wu said it was both his “moral” and “constitutional” duty to “not be a willing participant” in Abbott’s attempt to appease Trump’s demand for more congressional seats.“Denying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment of my office,” Wu said. “It was a fulfillment of my oath.”Trump, who had been unusually silent on the dramatic showdown that he set in motion, also weighed in on Tuesday. Asked by a reporter whether the FBI should assist with tracking down state Democratic lawmakers, the president said the agency “may have to”.“The governor of Texas is demanding they come back,” Trump said. “You can’t just sit it out. You have to go back. You have to fight it out. That’s what elections are all about.”Earlier on Tuesday, Trump argued thatRepublicanswere entitled to the five additional seats they could stand to gain if the new map were approved.New Texas Republican maps dilute Latino voting power in Austin – expertsRead more“We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats,” Trump said in an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box. “We have a really good governor, and we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas. I got the highest vote in the history of Texas, as you probably know, and we are entitled to five more seats.”“In Illinois, what’s happened is terrible what they’re doing,” the president added. “And you notice, they go to Illinois for safety, but that’s all gerrymandered. California is gerrymandered. We should have many more seats in Congress in California. It’s all gerrymandered.”Democrats and Republicans have both used gerrymandering to maximize their party’s political power, though in recent years Republicans have been far more aggressive – and effective – in deploying the tactic.California voters approved an independent re-districting commission to draw the state’s congressional maps for the first time in 2010. But the Democratic governor,Gavin Newsom, has vowed to “fight fire with fire” byasking voters to override the commissionand approve new maps that would favor California Democrats if Texas moved forward with its gerrymandering plan. At a press conference on Monday, Newsom said he hoped Texas Republicans would retreat, but that California would not hesitate to respond in a way that carried “profound national implications” for balance of power in Washington.At a news conference in Illinois, Texas Democrats were joined by Pritzker, who hailed them as “heroes”, and the Democratic National Committee chair Ken, Martin, who accused Republicans of attempting to “steal their way to victory”.Pritzker has also said that Illinois may respond to Texas’s efforts by redrawing its own map in Democrats’ favor, given that “everything has to be on the table”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He added that state troopers were “actively working to compel their attendance after I signed their civil arrest warrants yesterday”.Burrows said the chamber would reconvene and attempt to reach quorum again on Friday.Gina Hinojosa, a Democratic state representative who left Texas for Illinois on Sunday, said that she and her colleagues planned to be absent from the state capitol for “as long as it takes” to thwart the Republicans’ redistricting plans.The current special legislative session, called by the Texas governor, lasts until 19 August. “As long as we need to stay away and deny quorum on this bill to pass the truck maps, I will stay away,” Hinojosa said, speaking from a suburb of Chicago.Abbott could continue to call additional special sessions, and it’s not clear how long Democrats could stay outside the state. Each lawmaker who has absconded faces a $500-per-day fine, and Abbott has ordered the Texas department of public safety to “locate, arrest and return to the House chamber any member who has abandoned their duty to Texans”.Hinojosa shrugged off Republicans’ threats to remove Democratic members from office, calling it “disrespectful” to the Texans who elected them, many of whom, she said, have expressed “nothing but gratitude” to the lawmakers standing up to Trump. Though she lamented the redistricting “arms race” that the Texas undertaking had triggered – with Democratic states vowing to respond in kind – Hinojosa said it was imperative that her party confront the “real, present-day threats” posed by redrawn congressional maps.“Democrats need to fight to win,” she said. “We fight to win for the day, and we take tomorrow as it comes.”Yet breaking quorum is atime-honoredminority party tactic in Texas. During a contentious mid-decade redistricting battle in 2003, Democrats fled the state in an attempt to prevent Republicans from approving a new congressional map. Eventually, enough members returned to Austin, and the map wasadopted.“The thing that’s new now is the sense that there is no other recourse,” said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles whose expertise is in redistricting.He pointed to the 2019 supreme court decision, in which the justices ruled that federal courts were powerless to hear challenges to partisan gerrymandering. Meanwhile, the Republican-controlled Congress has shown no appetite for defying Trump, even if some Republican members are beginning tofearhis gambit in Texas could backfire politically.And while partisan redistricting is not illegal under the US constitution, Levitt said many voters, especially in places like California, are furious over what they have come to view as a power grab by Trump and Texas Republicans.“In any society, when people see a breakdown in the rule of law and no opportunity for accountability, they tend to turn to self-help,” Levitt said. He said. “It’s not good … but a zone where politics is used not to build but to punish is not a positive development for American democracy.”Explore more on these topicsTexasRepublicansTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If you watch carefully, what he doesn’t say can be just as telling as what he does.“Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods,” he told the nation ahead of his re-election. The US presidentdeclaredthat 2 April would “forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn”, only to pausetariffsa week later.He promised peace in Ukraine on day one of his presidency, only to laterclarifythis was “said in jest”; and he has claimed very few people can beat him at golf, only forfootage from Scotlandto raise questions over just how honest that round might be.Good, mad and ugly: the US economy’s performance under Trump – in chartsRead moreAs a real estate mogul, reality TV star and political campaigner, Trump learned to bend narrative to his will, even if it meant straying from reality.As president, this often leaves a gap between what he says and what he does. In many cases, the administration’s actions are more important to follow than the firehose of words.If you were, say, a US business buying coffee from Brazil, you might have rushed to import it last week after Trump insisted 1 August was the cast-iron deadline for new tariffs. “It stands strong, and will not be extended,” hewroteon Wednesday – hours before signing an executive order that said new steep tariffs on the country would come into force on 8 August, after all.And if you’re a US consumer, you might reasonably ask how inflation can be “dead”, as the White House has claimed, if you’re still shelling out more on groceries each month.The president has an awful lot to say about tariffs. They will, he argues, raise “trillions” of dollars for the US federal government; eliminate trade deficits with other countries; and evenpunish Brazilfor putting his ally the former president Jair Bolsonaro on trial for allegedly seeking to seize power after losing the 2022 presidential election. The list goes on.But what about what the presidentdoesn’tsay?Trump was re-elected last November after repeatedly pledging to rapidly bring down prices for Americans. This assurance formed a central pillar of his election campaign – a regular refrain in rallies, interviews and debates – as millions found it harder to make ends meet after years of inflation.Every policy comes at a cost. Every tax must be paid by someone, somewhere. For consumers, the Budget Lab at Yale estimates the short-term price impact of Trump’s tariff changes is equivalent to an average per household income loss of $2,400.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One of the few times he has acknowledged it might actually exacerbate inflation led to abizarre tangentabout dolls back in May. Acknowledging that tariffs might cause price rises, Trump suggested American children might have to settle for having “two dolls instead of 30 dolls”.Back then, Joe Bidenwas still to blamefor any signs of strife in the economy, according to Trump. Now he argues almost daily that theFederal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, is responsible.The biggest indication yet that the US economy is creaking on Trump’s watch came on Friday, when official data revealed that the labor market had stalled this summer. Heunceremoniously fired the veteran officialin charge of the statistics – and alleged, without evidence, that the numbers had been rigged.With higher US tariffs now in place on a string of countries, the president and his administration will inevitably say a lot about the benefits of his economic strategy. They are already trying to stifle evidence of drawbacks. They might even raise the prospect of ahandout– pitched as a sign of this policy’s success, rather than a concession that many Americans are still hard up.But if you’re running a small business reliant on trade, or walking into the grocery store on a budget, reality supersedes rhetoric.

He did not name the other two, but is reportedly considering current governor Christopher Waller, who has advocated rate cuts but not at the pace or extent Trump wants.Trump steps up attacks on Fed’s independence amid interest rates rowRead more“There are numerous people that are qualified,” Trump said. “I am going to be announcing that very shortly,” the president said of naming a replacement for Kugler. “A lot of people say, when you do that, why don’t you just pick the person who is going to head up the Fed? That’s a possibility too,” Trump said.Trump has beencritical of Powellfor not cutting interest rates, even as Fed policymakers balance evidence of both a slowing economy and a weakeningjob marketagainst the fact that inflation remains well above the central bank’s 2% target and is expected to move higher.Whoever Trump names to Kugler’s seat will need to be confirmed by the Senate, and it would be for a shortened term of only a few months, and require another Senate vote for a full 14-year term early next year. The nomination for chair of the Fed board would require a separate nomination and Senate confirmation process.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS economyDonald TrumpEconomic policynewsShareReuse this content"

News Corp also owns book publisher HarperCollins, which has published three of Trump’s books, though his best-known title, The Art of the Deal, was published by Random House.Still, the company appeared keen to warn Trump about the impact AI is having on publishing.“The AI age must cherish the value of intellectual property if we are collectively to realize our potential,” News Corp said in a statement with its fourth-quarter earnings report. “Even the president of the United States is not immune to blatant theft. The president’s books are still reporting healthy sales, but are being consumed by AI engines which profit from his thoughts by cannibalizing his concepts, thus undermining future sales of his books.“Suddenly, The Art of the Deal has become The Art of the Steal.”Media outlets have sued AI companies, including OpenAI, operator of ChatGPT, for using their content to train AI models without permission. In May, a federal judgerejectedOpenAI’s request to dismiss a lawsuit from the New York Times over its usage of the newspaper’s content. Dow Jones, which publishes the Wall Street Journal, and the New York PostsuedPerplexity AI in October over similar copyright claims.News Corp’s message to Trump also comes after the White House last monthannouncedTrump’s “AI action plan” that would see the loosening of AI regulations that had been put in place under the Biden administration.In an earnings call on Tuesday, the News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said that the company is in the middle of “advanced negotiations with several AI companies”.“It’s clear that many of them have come to recognize that the purchase of [intellectual property] is as important as the acquisition of semiconductors or the securing of stable energy sources,” he said, noting that it’s a mix of “wooing and suing”.The inside story of the Murdoch editor taking on Donald TrumpRead more“We prefer the former, but we will never shy away from protecting our property rights,” he said.The warning comes at a tense moment between News Corp and the White House.

Trump claimed that the report was false and amounted to libel. The newspaper has requested a judge dismiss the case.Murdoch, who also owns Fox News, was once friendly with Trump, though relations soured during the president’s third presidential campaign.The company beat fourth-quarter expectations with Tuesday’s earnings announcement, largely due to a rise in digital subscriptions from Dow Jones, which houses the company’s business publications like the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s and MarketWatch.

The interim CEO, Nik Jhangiani, said the savings were “not about job cuts”, adding that while some roles would go, the overall workforce could still increase.The figures come weeks after the surprise announcement that the group had begun the hunt for a successor to Crew, who it said had stepped down “by mutual agreement”, after a period of investor disquiet over its declining share price.The group also reiterated that it expected an annual hit of $200m from Donald Trump’s tariffs. The figure –first floated in February– assumes there are no further changes to rates on imports into the US, meaning the 10% levy remains on UK drink, along with the 15% on the EU, while Mexican and Canadian spirits remain exempt.The tariffs on British goods came into effect on 30 June, when theUK-US trade deal kicked in, while the new 15% levy on EU goods willbegin on 7 Augustas part of the White House’s suite of “reciprocal” tariffs being imposed on dozens of the US’s trading partners.The British drinks company said it had “continued to undertake considerable contingency planning” in recent months, and remained “focused on what we can control in relation to tariffs”.Diageo said it had been working to mitigate the impact of tariffs, carrying out work including “inventory management, supply chain optimisation and reallocation of investments”.As a result, the company believes it will be able to mitigate about half of the impact of tariffs on its operating profit.Diageo’s performance was lacklustre under Crew, who took the helm in 2023 after the sudden illness and death of Ivan Menezes – a popular figure who led Diageo successfully for 10 years.Early in Crew’s tenure the company issued a profits warning as a result of a sales slump in Latin America and the Caribbean, while last Christmas the company was seen to have misjudged its supply chain, and UK pubs complained that their flow of Guinnesshad been rationedshortly before the festive season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The share price is no higher than it was in 2016.The company’s shares have also been hit by changes in drinking habits, especially among younger consumers, while the cost of living crisis has resulted in some people switching to cheaper brands.Explore more on these topicsDiageoFood & drink industryTrump tariffsInternational tradeTariffsDonald TrumpEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In an unusually blunt speech this month, China’s president criticised provincial governments for blindly overinvesting in artificial intelligence, in computing power and in new energy vehicles, industries that Beijing has identified as strategic priorities but which are also at risk of overheating.On 23 July, Xi gave another speech in which he stressed the importance of breaking the cycle of “involution” that has gripped parts of theChinese economy, the world’s second-biggest after the US.Some of China’s big car companies, includingBYD, the EV maker that is seen as China’s rival to Tesla, were summoned to meetings with regulators last month to receive warnings about overcapacity.Hutong Research, an independent advisory firm based in Beijing and Shanghai, said in a recent note: “Government agencies across China have moved swiftly in response to Xi’s recent remarks, pledging to implement supply-side reductions.“These developments highlight not only the elevated political attention to excess capacity but also the breadth of the problem across China’s economy.”In the hyper-competitive Chinese economy, consumers, unwilling to part with their cash, have come to expect rock-bottom prices. Companies across industries often cut prices to near or below cost levels in a play for market dominance.EU may as well be ‘province of China’ due to reliance on imports, says industrialistRead moreChina’s EV companies are no exception, and many bosses have complained about the phenomenon while also being dragged into it.BYD has repeatedly cut the price of its low-end Seagull, most recently offering it for 55,800 yuan (£5,862), nearly 20% below the official retail price. In March, it cut prices across the Seagull range by 3,000 yuan. Great Wall Motors, one of BYD’s competitors, released a new version of its Ora 3 car in June for about 20% less than the September retail price.In January, He Xiaopeng, the chief executive of XPeng Motors, reportedly told employees that “the market will definitely see fiercer competition in 2025” and that some auto companies would not survive the looming price war.View image in fullscreenVehicles under production at Great Wall Motors’ factory in the Yongchuan district of Chongqing, south-west China.Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/ShutterstockLast month, China revealeda new draft amendment to its law on pricing– the first revision to the law since 1998 – specifically aimed at the price wars.The amendment would strengthen rules around the government’s ability to set price limits, identify “unfair pricing behaviour” and curb “involution-style” competition, including using market dominance to influence prices and bulk sales.But the responses may not go far enough, some analysts said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

And ultimately, you would need to provide an alternative to a lot of these local governments, for instance.”Hmaidi said one solution to a glut of products in China could be to sell even more overseas, aggravating foreign companies and regulators. “I think in the short term, there will be more tension with most of its trading partners,” she added.Theflood of Chinese EVs to the European Unionhas alarmed EU officials who worry that their own carmakers will not be able to compete.Last year, the EU imposed tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese-built battery EVs, angering Beijing. A recent EU-China summit failed to make any progress on the issue, which has been a major sticking point between the two trading partners.But Chinese carmakers adapted by pushing plug-in hybrid vehicles instead. In June, Chinese companies reached a 10% share of Europe’s EV market, making a full comeback on their pre-tariff market share.Last week the politburo, the group of leading officials in the Chinese Communist party, met to discuss the economic outlook for the year ahead. While they did not mention the anti-involution campaign specifically, they spoke of the need to “regulate disorderly competition” in the economy.Additional research by Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsAutomotive industryChinese economyChinaAsia PacificManufacturing sectorElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsXi JinpingShareReuse this content"

Just 12 years old, the Tahitian local won the event trials last month to book a spot in the main draw, making her the youngest competitor in WSL history. She will face the current world No 1, Molly Picklum of Australia, and American star Lakey Peterson in the opening round, before celebrating her 13th birthday midway through the event.The contest site, Teahupo’o, is renowned as being among the heaviest waves in the world. But Gallina is a regular – she speaks to the Guardian by phone with her father, Ryan, from their homein Teahupo’o village. “We can see [the wave] from our bedroom,” says Ryan, who is originally from Hawaii (Kelia’s mother is Tahitian). Such is her local status that Kelia’s Instagram handle is simply@MissTeahupoo.View image in fullscreenGallina surfs a local wave in Tahiti.Photograph: Wendy Cowan“I’m pretty surprised,” the youngster admits after her trials victory. “I just can’t wait.” Her father shares these emotions. “We’re in shock,” he says. “We always visualised this happening, but not at all did we think it would happen so soon.”Blakey Johnston surfs 4,000 waves in 25 days, a new world record – in picturesRead moreKelia started surfing when she was three, at the suggestion of her father – himself a passionate surfer. “It’s always fun,” she says. “I have a lot of friends who surf every day too, so I’m just with them, all day, every day.” Barely a decade later, Kelia will surf against the best in the world.In recent years, Kelia has been a regular participant in Rising Tides – a WSL program that sees pro surfers guide and mentor young locals during a competition stop. “My birthday is 10 August, so it’s always been around my birthday,” she says. “It’s the best birthday present ever. It’s super inspiring to surf with [defending world champion] Caity Simmers, Molly Picklum, all those girls. I’m excited to have them in a heat.”View image in fullscreenWSL Rising Tides participants before the 2023 Tahiti Pro at Teahupo’o.Photograph: Matt Dunbar/World Surf LeagueOn a big swell, Teahupo’o is fearsome – waves track thousands of kilometres across the Pacific before unloading on to a shallow Tahitian reef. For a decade and a half, the women’s side of the WSL did not feature a leg in Tahiti; the event was discontinued in 2006 reportedly due to injury fears, a decision that was criticised at the time as sexist. That was reversed in 2022 after the WSL men’s and women’s calendars were integrated.Last year, that decision wasmore than vindicatedwhen the top female surfers looked at home in heaving 8-10ft Teahupo’o barrels. “It definitely gives me reasons to want to go on the bigger waves,” Kelia says. “I feel like the level of the girls is getting way better every year. I’m really happy to be part of that next generation.”View image in fullscreenGallina waits for a wave.Photograph: Richard SeehausenThe youngster started surfing Teahupo’o at four and a half years old – she can’t recall whether she was fearful at first. “I think so,” she says with a laugh. “It’s kind of hard to remember.” Ryan admits he continues to harbour some concerns, but, he says, “nothing out of the ordinary for a parent.”“Of course you worry,” Ryan says. “Like you worry when they’re crossing the street, or riding around in town, there’s always somewhat of a worry that comes with being a parent. But I’ve been about 23 years out at this wave, and feel I know it pretty intimately – so I pride myself in knowing when is a good time [for Kelia to surf].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In bigger waves – Kelia says she has previously surfed 12ft faces – Ryan will stay close in the water and help guide his daughter into the waves. “They’re not going to allow that [during competition],” he says. So the Mehani Gallina family are hoping the swell is good, but not too good, come competition day. “We’re praying the waves aren’ttoobig,” he adds. The family also take peace of mind from the fact that “the best life-saving water patrol in the world” will be close to hand, Ryan says.View image in fullscreenGallina in the water at Teahupo’o.Photograph: Damien Poullenot/World Surf League/Getty ImagesNot yet a teenager, Kelia says she wants to qualify for the WSL in the future – even if her debut appearance came earlier than expected. “That’s definitely the goal, to make it on tour,” she says. The Mehani Gallina family are trying to manage expectations, though. “We acknowledge that it is extremely difficult to make it to that level,” Ryan adds. “It’s a goal, but notthegoal.Surfingis a lifestyle for us, so whether or not that happens, it’s just about being in the ocean, getting better every day and having something you’re passionate about.”In the coming days, when the buzzer goes to begin her heat, Kelia will make history – even before she surfs a wave. Could an upset be on the cards? “I’m just going to wait until the moment,” says Kelia.But Ryan is hoping that age and relative inexperience could work in his daughter’s favour. “There is really no pressure on her to do anything – no one expected her to get this far,” he says. “[Kelia] is the biggest underdog ever – the pressure is on [the other surfers in the heat].

Sanders and Huntley may split the workload at Carolina if the Browns do not plan to play their other quarterbacks.Sanders, 23, was widely expected to be a first-round draft pick and one of the first quarterbacks selected last April. Instead, hedropped to the fifth round, where the Browns drafted him 144th overall – two rounds after they drafted Gabriel from Oregon.After a prolific college career playing for his father Deion Sanders at Jackson State and Colorado, Shedeur Sanders is battling for a roster spot.

The body will work with local and state authorities on security and transportation for the first Games in the US in nearly three decades.Trump will chair the taskforce, while Vance will serve as vice-chair and an executive director will oversee “daily operations”, according to the White House.“The LA Olympics is shaping up to be a wonderful moment for America. It’s going to be incredible,” Trump said.With the Olympics just three years away,Los Angeleshas been rushing to prepare for the Games, which are expected to attract millions of people over the course of 16 days.The city has been planning for the event for years. In recent weeks, city leaders have been engaged in what the Los Angeles Times described as“high-stakes” negotiationswith LA28, the committee managing the event, over the use of city staff, including police officers. Meanwhile, aproposed ballot measurecould require some Olympic venues to receive approval from voters in order to be used.The preparations come at a challenging time for LA. The devastating wildfires that tore through the area in January and recovery efforts have strained the region’s finances.Meanwhile, the city has clashed fiercely with the Trump administration over aggressive immigration raids in the region and the deployment of US troops into the city over the objections of city and state leaders.Still, LA mayor Karen Bass has said the city will be ready to host the Olympics. And during the peak of this summer’s protests, the former International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, expressed confidence in the “strong” city and said the Games have the support of US leaders.“With regard to LA, we have the full support of the president of the United States and the governor of California and the mayor of Los Angeles for the success of these Olympic Games,” Bach told theAssociated Pressin June before he stepped down.Trump’s announcement of the taskforce displayed his strong support for the LA Olympicsand his contentious relationship with the region’s leaders.In the past, Trump has frequently touted his support for hosting the Games in Los Angeles and his recent budget bill allocates $1bn for security, planning and other Olympic-related costs.At the White House on Tuesday, the president said that the city is “a little bit of a different place” than it was when selected in 2017, but “we’re gonna bring it back stronger than ever”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was acquitted of 17 other similar counts. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 on each count when he’s formally sentenced at a later date.“The FBI will not stand for those who perpetuate the despicable crime of dogfighting,” FBI director Kash Patel said in a statement. “Thanks to the hard work of our law enforcement partners, those who continue to engage in organized animal fighting and cruelty will face justice.”Prosecutors alleged that Johnson operated Mal Kant Kennels in Broken Arrow and Haskell, Oklahoma, and selectively bred pit bull-type dogs known as champions or grand champions because of winning dog fights. Earlier this year, the government seized 190 dogs from Johnson that have been in the custody of the US Marshals Service.Johnson allegedly bred dogs that had won as many as five fights and then sold “stud rights” and their offspring to other dogfighters, according to the Justice Department. The trafficking took place across the US and helped to grow the dogfighting industry, while resulting in Johnson profiting financially, prosecutors alleged.View image in fullscreenPit bulls that were owned by former NFL football player LeShon Johnson are kept in a section of the Tulsa Animal Shelter that is marked off by tape.Photograph: John Clanton/APJohnson’s attorney, Billy Coyle, said his client was a dog breeder who was never accused of fighting dogs and noted that the jury acquitted Johnson on most of the counts against him.“He was simply a breeder of the American pit bull terrier,” Coyle said. “Obviously the jury found that some of his dogs bred were probably or were used in dog fighting, and those were difficult charges to fight.”Coyle said federal agents also used heavy-handed tactics, with more than 40 officers raiding his home late at night, pointing guns at Johnson and his wife and seizing his dogs and property.Johnson previously pleaded guilty to state animal fighting charges in 2004 in Oklahoma. He was given a five-year deferred sentence, according to court documents.Johnson was a running back who played for theGreen Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Giants from 1994 through 1999.Explore more on these topicsNFLOklahomaArizona CardinalsNew York GiantsGreen Bay PackersUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The NWSL’s defense also claims it had no duty of care to San Diego Wave employees as any incidents that occurred were between the individuals and the club – not the league.According to legal experts interviewed by the Guardian, the NWSL’s response to the lawsuit is a catch-all answer that aims to cover all possible angles of defense.“The defendant has simply listed every affirmative defense that could apply to any of the claims,” said Professor David Oppenheimer, clinical professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law. “The common term for such an answer is ‘boilerplate.’ The purpose is to preserve any conceivable defense.”An NWSL spokesperson said the league could not comment on pending litigation. Arentfox Schiff did not respond to requests for comment and clarification.The six women who filed the lawsuit include one who claims she was sexually assaulted by a San Diego Wave co-worker, another who claims she was sexually harassed by the same co-worker, and Brittany Alvarado, a former videographer for the Wave, claiming workplace-related violations. Three other women are named in the suit for similar alleged violations. Alvarado brought attention to the workplace environment at San Diego Wave after she posted on social media in 2024 that the “NWSL must take immediate action to remove Jill Ellis from both the San Diego Wave and the league entirely.”NWSL and US Soccer’s lack of transgender policy targeted by conservative lobby groupsRead moreEllis, the former USWNT head coach, was Wave president at the time of the events alleged in the lawsuit and had a hands-on role in managing the club. Ellis has since departed San Diego to take a senior roleat Fifa as its chief football officer. Ellis is not a defendant in the lawsuit but is named within it, described as having “set an abusive and toxic workplace culture” and “once asking random men in Kansas City about their penises”. (Ellis has filed a separate defamation suit against Alvarado based on her social media post.)The Guardian previously revealed that a 2024 investigationby the NWSL into San Diego Wave management found that the club’s front office “could have done more” to address a sexual assault allegation but found no specific issue with how the claim was handled because the alleged victim did not use the term “sexual” when describing her experience. The San Diego Wave is a co-defendant in the case with the NWSL.As reported by the Guardian, Jane Doe 1 alleges that a night out in San Diego with a co-worker led to “inappropriate activities including a game of ‘Sexy Jenga’ that led to him pressuring her into non-consensual sexual acts”. Jane Doe 1 alleges that later at her apartment, while she was drunk, she was pressured into “sexual activity that she explicitly stated she did not consent to”.The NWSL’s defense argues that consent was given.Under California law, consent requires an individual to freely give agreement to engage in sexual activity “and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction involved.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jane Doe 2 claims she was terminated by the club after she did not work the minimum number of shifts in her non-full-time role – shifts that were assigned by the alleged harasser.“In a negligence case, consent is a potential defense when the plaintiff has agreed to participate in an activity knowing that there are significant risks of harm, and willing to subject themselves to them,” Oppenheimer said. “The best examples come from sports, but for the athletes … In this case, for the statutory claims under the civil rights laws, there is no defense of consent.”Oppenheimer offered a hypothetical scenario for the NWSL to launch a successful defense:“[The] defendant proves that as each employee was hired they were warned, ‘You need to know that this is a toxic workplace. We permit emotional and sexual harassment, we retaliate against people who complain, and we fire people in bad faith. If you don’t want to subject yourself to this, don’t work here.’ That might be enough to defend themselves on the negligent hiring and management claim, but it would subject them to liability on the statutory discrimination claims.”The defense also claims the case should be dismissed because the plaintiffs delayed bringing the lawsuit and that a two-year statute of limitations under California law should be enforced. The earliest claims made in the case took place in mid-2022. The suit was filed in October of 2024. The NWSL’s lawyers cite a section of California code of civil procedure stipulating that there is a two-year statute of limitations to sue for “An action for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.” California law stipulates elsewhere that there is a 10-year statute of limitations for criminal sexual assault claims (the NWSL case in question is civil).The NWSL claims it cannot be held accountable for events described in the lawsuit because they fall outside the relationship between the league and the Wave. The league claims it did not know the incidents occurred nor should it have known.The former San Diego Wave employees have requested a trial by jury.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsSan Diego WavenewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersFaith in young manager Fabian Hürzeler, and a reshaped defence, gives hope of a sustained push for European placeByEd AaronsTue 5 Aug 2025 19.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 19.32 EDTShareGuardian writers’ predicted position:8th (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons’ prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Last season’s position:8thProspectsBrighton kitsAlthough Brighton missed out on qualifying for Europe again, there was a sense of optimism rather than disappointment at the end of Fabian Hürzeler’s first season at the helm. Had it not been for a costly loss of form in the spring that brought one point from four league games and adefeat by Nottingham Forest on penalties in the last eightof the FA Cup, the German head coach might even have matched his predecessor, Roberto De Zerbi’s achievement of finishing sixth.After a raft of injuries to key players all season and with several signings from a summer spending spree of almost £200m struggling to settle, it was to Hürzeler’s credit that his team ended only one point short of Brighton’s record points tally from 2023 after three wins to round off the campaign. Now, in the words of chair Tony Bloom, with the youngest permanent Premier League manager having gained a year’s experience, “we are hoping for more next season”.Brighton scored 66 goals – the joint fifth-highest in the division – so much will depend on strengthening a defence that conceded 59, with the emphasis this summer on finding a long-term replacement for the veteran captain Lewis Dunk as he enters the last year of his contract. Diego Coppola, an Italy Under-21 centre-back, and Olivier Boscagli, who arrived on a free transfer from PSV, will be joined by the exciting Belgium left-back Maxim De Cuyper as Hürzeler hopes to build a more settled unit.The departure of João Pedro, who became thelatest Brighton player to join Chelsea, has been offset by the signing of the highly regarded 18-year-old striker Charalampos Kostoulas. His fellow Greece Under-21 international Stefanos Tzimas andSunderland’s playoff hero Tommy Watsonwill provide more attacking options for a squad that still includes the outstanding Kaoru Mitoma despite speculation he could depart and looks equipped to maintain a sustained push for Europe.How they finished in the past five seasonsThe managerHürzeler is guaranteed to wear his heart on his sleeve and has proved a hit with Brighton’s supporters after the popular De Zerbi’s departure. In an interview with British GQ in April, the 32-year-old revealed that he loves watches and Coldplay but never sits down in front of the television because there “are so many better things to do”. “I’m a big believer that the limit for our body is really high, and I think we don’t always try to push our limits,” he said. Brighton’s players should be well prepared for the start of the season in that case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

João Pedro’s departure for £60m will help to balance the books after lastsummer’s massive outlay made them the biggest net spenders in Europe. Bloom, who bought 29% of the Scottish club Hearts in June, is estimated to have invested more than £400m at his home-town club since becoming chair in 2009. In April, the long-serving chief executive, Paul Barber, committed his future until 2030.Last season’s resultsStar signingMuch is expected of Kostoulas after Brighton saw off interest from several other clubs, including Chelsea, to snap him up for an initial fee of almost £30m that could rise by £2m to make him the most expensive Greek player in history. Represented by the same agent who tookGiannis Antetokounmpoto the NBA, he became the youngest player to make a professional appearance for Olympiakos when he represented their B team at 15 years and seven months, before he was part of the side that won the prestigious Uefa Youth League last year. Kostoulas will learn plenty from the evergreen Danny Welbeck, who finished as last season’s joint top scorer and turns 35 in November.Stepping upBart Verbruggen, having strangely alternated with Jason Steele under De Zerbi, was preferred between the sticks by Hürzeler last season but the Dutchman made several costly errors. Nonetheless, a recent survey by the Swiss research group CIES Football Observatory identified the 22-year-old as potentially the world’s most valuable goalkeeper with a projected fee of £54m. Verbruggen, who joined Brighton in 2023 from Anderlecht for £16m, will need to show more consistency to retain Hürzeler’s faith, although the England Under-21 goalkeeper James Beadle was allowed to join Birmingham on loan rather than provide more competition for the Netherlands international.Explore more on these topicsPremier League previews 2025-26Brighton & Hove AlbionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The next major city is Leeds, two hours drive to the south … London feels very far away.”If Eddie Howe can only hope his prospective signings do not stumble across the Rough Guides introduction to England’s northern cities, Newcastle’s manager may also reflect that it was not supposed to be like this.Manchester United rival Newcastle with Sesko bid and believe he prefers Old TraffordRead moreThe days when the club’s recruitment strategy was often a victim of its geographical isolation were supposed to have ended four years ago when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fundobtained the keys to St James’ Park.In October 2021 there was a sense of giddiness in the Tyneside air as Amanda Staveley, the then Newcastle director and minority owner who played a key role in convincing one of the world’s richest sovereign wealth funds to buy the club from Mike Ashley, settled back into a sofa at the city’s leafy Jesmond Dene House hotel and spoke of soaring ambition and trophies galore.Since then a series of leading players including Alexander Isak, Sandro Tonali and Bruno Guimarães have signed for Newcastle, Howe’s team are in the Champions League for the second time in three years and are theholders of the Carabao Cup, their first domestic trophy for 70 years.Rather less positively, Isak is doing his utmost toforce through a move to Liverpool, a slew of big names have turned down Howe in favour of relocating to London or Manchester this summer and Newcastle are seeking their third sporting director and second chief executive in three years.Oh and Staveley and her husband, Mehrdad Ghodoussi, are no longer around, after being ousted in a boardroom power struggle last summer. Staveley spoke subsequently of her “heartbreak” and “devastation” at that departure, insisting rumours of a planned exit were “absolute rubbish”.Thirteen months on Newcastle’s chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan, and the rest of the Riyadh-based Saudi ownership are perhaps realising that maybe she was more important to their Geordie project than they realised. Arguably almost everything that has subsequently gone wrong seems rooted in that parting of the ways.View image in fullscreenNewcastle’s Eddie Howe has seen a number of transfer targets sign for rival clubs.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesCrucially, Staveley and Ghodoussi were excellent communicators within a club where, at assorted levels, personal connections have since loosened and the Saudi ownership remain so remote that no representative of PIF has spoken to the UK football media.In contrast Staveley was big on the human touch, taking time to stop and chat to players, staff and, occasionally, reporters while also sending first-teamers regular text messages as she established rare trust with the instinctively wary Howe. Maybe Staveley sometimes over-promised. Isak’s representatives certainly believe the striker was assured his £150,000-a-week wages would be boosted significantly last summer and the fallout is hurting Howe now.Yet given that Newcastle only narrowly avoided a potential points deduction and heavy fine after scrambling to comply with Premier League spending rules within hours of a key deadline last June, the club’s decision to tell Isak he would have to be content with his current deal after all represented financial logic.Howe’s problem was that a striker who proceeded to score 27 goals last season remained seriously annoyed. Indeed Isak, along with certain similarly sulky teammates, started the campaign badly and it took the manager’s considerable man-management skills to talk them round. It did not go unnoticed that, after the Carabao Cup triumph, Isak’s body language turned uninterested again.Even so, the Swede had three years on his contract and there was a – misplaced – sense that a supposedly “laid-back” character would not “rock the boat”, let alone skip a pre-season tour of south east Asia, particularly as he was poised to be offered an improved contract this summer.Instead Liverpool’s interest turned the head of a striker said to be disappointed that there is still no sign of a much-vaunted new training ground at a club where a long-awaited, and much-delayed, decision as to whether Newcastle will revamp St James’ Park or build a new stadium has again been postponed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Zépiqueno Redmond, signed from Feyenoord, could depart on loan.Uncertainty continues to surround Emiliano Martínez, who is thought to be keen on exploring a fresh challenge. Watkins has been thesubject of interest from rivalsbut Villa do not wish to sell. Villa also want to trim their squad and offload fringe players such as Àlex Moreno and Leander Dendoncker.Meanwhile, theLiverpoolmidfielder Tyler Morton has joined Lyon in a £15m deal. The 22-year-old, who came through the academy ranks at Liverpool, had interest from several European and Premier League clubs this summer but opted to pursue more regular first-team football in France. Liverpool have also negotiated a 20% sell-on clause in any future transfer.The Premier League champions are well stocked in central midfield and Morton’s opportunities may have been further limited next season by the return of Stefan Bajcetic, plus the development of James McConnell and Luca Stephenson.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowAston VillaLiverpoolnewsShareReuse this content"

According to Kick It Out’s data,reports of sexism and misogynyrose by 67% on the year before, up from 115 to 192.Reports of online sexism rose by 72% while reports related to misogyny in youth football doubled. Within stadiums, 18 reports of sexist chanting at matches were recorded, almost equalling the total from the previous four seasons combined.The uptick in reporting is likely in part down to greater awareness, both of the tools available to combat abuse and of the women’s game itself. Kick It Out partnered with Women In Football last year to call for a crackdown on sexist behaviour and for incidents to be incorporated into official police statistics. The rise in popularity in women’s football has been dogged by a growth in people criticising its validity, especially on social media.Ableist abuse also rose substantially last season, increasing by 45% on the year, but there was a small decline in homophobic abuse. Reports of racism also fell overall, though Kick it Out says racism remains “prevalent” online, and the number of incidents reported in the professional game increased from 223 to 245.“What we’re seeing now is that fans aren’t just reporting abuse, they’re demanding action,” Samuel Okafor, the chief executive of Kick It Out, said. “There’s been a clear shift this season in how people are calling out sexist behaviour, both online and in stadiums, and asking football to treat it as seriously as any other form of hate.“At the same time, it’s clear that online platforms are still falling short. The volume of abuse remains high, and too often those responsible face no consequences. Fans are doing their part by speaking up. It’s now up to football authorities, tech companies and government to show they’re listening, and to act.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision is expected to be revealed by Cas on Monday, the day after Glasner’s FA Cup holders face the Premier League champions Liverpool in the Community Shield at Wembley.‘It becomes your life’: Holmesdale Fanatics take Palace’s fight to the authoritiesRead more“We don’t have any influence on the decision from Uefa, we don’t have any influence on the decision from Cas, so it just makes no sense that we’re thinking about it,” Glasner told Sky on Tuesday.“We focus on what we have to do on the pitch, how to create this spirit in the group, this togetherness, this commitment, and this is what we are doing day by day. We’re waiting for the final decision, we’re still confident that the appeal will be successful and that we will play in theEuropa League. But in the end, on 11 August, we will know the final decision – then we will start to prepare for Europe.”Palace – who confirmed last month that the New York Jets owner, Woody Johnson, completed his purchase of John Textor’s 43% stake – are understood to believe they have a strong chance of winning the appeal. They are expected to present evidence that they insist proves Uefa’s deadline to change their ownership structure so they complied with its rules was not 1 March but rather 30 April, as well as pointing out that Textor’s departure has removed the barrier to their participation.The American still owns the French club Lyon, who have also qualified for the coming season’s Europa League. It is understood that Textor will not be part of the Palace delegation that travels to Switzerland for the Cas hearing.Nottingham Forest, who qualified for the Conference League after finishing seventh in the Premier League, would stand to be promoted to the Europa League if Palace’s appeal fails. On Monday, Palace were drawn to play against the losers of the Europa League qualifier between Norway’s Fredrikstad or Midtjylland of Denmark in the Conference League playoffs, with the first leg scheduled to take place at Selhurst Park on 21 August.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Gassama, signed this summer from Sheffield Wednesday, scored his side’s third in the 51st minute to put the Govan side into a commanding lead and eventually a comfortable win.Martin said: “I really enjoyed it. I’m proud of the guys. We had a really difficult evening on Saturday, just because there was not enough running in behind, aggression, intensity with the ball. We were not just ranting and raving, we showed a lot of clips and we tried to do a lot of learning in the meeting room and on the pitch in the last couple of days and they took it on brilliantly.“The guys that came in the team were fantastic. We’re going to need everyone. You don’t get dropped from this team, people come in and out quite a lot because we need to be fresh.”Martin claimed Tavernier was understanding of Martin’s decision to leave him on the sidelines. He said: “Yeah, yeah, he was great – all the guys. I say my piece, if they have a piece to say, then it’s really respectful and really honest. But I think the way he played when he came on showed you everything you need to know.

Along with Tavernier and Raskin – arguably their best player last season – Danilo and Kieran Dowell were left out.Oliver Antman, the Finland winger who joined from Go Ahead Eagles on Monday, made his debut with the left-back Jefté, the midfielder Lyall Cameron and Dessers returning while John Souttar was named captain.The Ibrox crowd was more subdued than usual on a big European night, initially. In the seventh minute Plzen’s lofty striker Rafiu Durosinmi headed a cross from Amar Memic past the post but it was Gassama who struck first, playing a one-two with Dessers at the edge of the visitors’ box before confidently curling the ball past the goalkeeper Florian Wiegele.View image in fullscreenRussell Martin congratulates Djeidi Gassama after Rangers’ victory.Photograph: Andrew Milligan/PAAfter the Rangers defender Nasser Djiga brilliantly blocked a goal-bound shot from the visiting captain ,Matej Vydra, Antman’s drive from a Gassama cut-back at the other end was cleared off the line by Vaclav Jemelka.When a driving run into the box by Antman ended with him being barged over by Vydra, Turpin pointed to the spot for a soft penalty and Dessers sent Wiegele the wrong way.Rangers started the second half strongly and within three minutes the midfielder Mohamed Diomande struck the bar with an effort from the edge of the box. However, the third soon arrived as Gassama grabbed his second when he bulleted in a header from a pinpoint Antman cross from the right to score his fourth goal in the past three European matches.Raskin, Danilo, and Tavernier all came off the bench when the job was done before the home keeper Jack Butland made a good save from a powerful drive from Memic.Malmö’shome matchagainst their local rivalsFC Copenhagenended in a goalless draw.

Singh appears to have hit back by seeking to ensure that Stelling is denied hospitality at Hartlepool’s away matches, which begin at Yeovil on Saturday.‘It becomes your life’: Holmesdale Fanatics take Palace’s fight to the authoritiesRead more“You may be aware from media coverage that Jeff Stelling has resigned as Honorary President of Hartlepool United Football Club,” Singh wrote in a letter sent last week. “As Chairman of Hartlepool United Football Club I would kindly and considerately ask that Mr Stelling is therefore not provided with official HUFC dignitary spaces in your board room, or equivalent, for any Hartlepool United fixture at your home ground.“In the unlikely event that Mr Stelling independently attends any Hartlepool United fixture at your home ground, I’d further request that you consider to seat Mr Stelling separately to any HUFC dignitaries or staff.”Stelling resigned after it became clear that a consortium’s proposed takeover was not progressing. The group led by the local businesswoman Shirley Hammond is understood to have grown frustrated that talks have stalled.“I know this is only an honorary role, but it is the best way I felt I could protest against the treatment of the party trying to take control of the club,” Stelling said when he resigned. “Supporters have been left in an intolerable position with a perceived threat to the future of the club should they not support the current owner.”Singh has since proposed holding a vote among season-ticket holders over whether he should stay in charge, although that has yet to take place.Stelling is a lifelong Hartlepool fan who often used his position as host of Sky Sports’ live scores and results programme, Soccer Saturday, which he presented for 29 years until 2023,to promote the club. In 2016 he was appointed as the club’s honorary president in place of Peter Mandelson, who was MP for Hartlepool from 1992 to 2004.Singh saved Hartlepool from liquidation when buying the then League Two club and investing £1.8m, but the club have struggled in recent seasons. The Teesside-based care-home owner put the club up for sale after their relegation from the Football League at the end of the 2022-23 season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

During Tuesday’s brief hearing at Westminster magistrates court, he stood in the dock dressed all in black with his arms behind his back.Partey has been charged with five counts of rape against two women and a charge of sexual assault against a third woman. The alleged offences are said to have taken place in 2021 and 2022 when he was an Arsenal player.The chief magistrate Paul Goldspring granted conditional bail, telling Partey he must not contact any of the three women. Partey was also told he must notify police of any permanent change of address and if he is to stay somewhere other than his home for 14 consecutive days. He was also told to notify police of any international travel ahead of time.Partey joined Arsenal from Atlético Madrid in 2020 in a transfer worth about £45m. The defensive midfielder had signed for the Spanish club in 2012 and made 188 appearances, as well as going out on loan to Mallorca and Leganés.He played 35 games for Arsenal in the Premier League last season, scoring four goals. Partey left the north London club at the end of his contract this summer. As bail conditions were discussed in court, Goldspring said: “I understand he’s no longer employed in this country and playing in Spain now.”The Metropolitan police said they first received allegations against him of rape in February 2022.Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, has previously said he “denies all the charges against him” and that he welcomed “the opportunity to finally clear his name”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Who can forgetRoss County deleting their own website, Kirk Broadfootsuffering facial burns after microwaving an eggand former Hearts manager Robbie Neilson trying to give journalists the slip as he left the club’s training ground by sending out a decoy (sports scientist John Hill) to the car parkin a Robbie Neilson mask. Edinburgh, very much the second city in Scotland when it comes to football, still has one of the game’s finest rivalries between two grand old clubs, Hearts and Hibernian. Each have had their moments in recent derbies: last year Hearts’ Lawrence Shankland celebrated scoring a penaltyby catching and eating a pie thrown by a Hibs supporter. In March, Jack Iredalescored a screamerto win the derby for Hibs. The post-match celebrations at Easter Road featured one ofthe finest ever renditions of Sunshine on Leith, a song sung with so much feeling that it left some Hibs players in tears. And who can blame them? If you get goosebumps watching that song, imagine what it must be like to come from that corner of Scotland, stand on that terrace and sing those lyrics in front of your victorious team. Magic.The point is, fitba is far greater than just Rangers and Celtic. And this is very much the opinion of Tony Bloom, the owner of Brighton who bought a 29% stake in Hearts this summer for £9.86m. Following the club’s opening win over Aberdeen – a 2-0 victory that leaves the Jambos top of the Premiership table – Bloom was in a bullish mood as he faced the media, explaining that he thinks Hearts can challenge for glory. “If we have not won the league title in the next 10 years, I will be very disappointed,” Bloom stated. “I want to make sure that we are in the talk to win the title at the start of each season.”We have heard this sort of patter before, a new owner coming in and telling a club’s supporters what they want to hear. The difference is, Bloom has a track record of using his army of data nerds and analytics gurus to drastically improve clubs with savvy recruitment. Brighton are now one of the best run clubs in England, while Union Saint-Gilloise, who were bottom of Belgium’s second tier when the Englishman took over in 2018, won the Belgian top flight a few months ago for the first time in 90 years and are in Bigger Cup.The last time a club that wasn’t called Celtic or Rangers won the Scottish Premiership was 1985 and the last time Hearts won it was 65 years ago, but Bloom seems untroubled. “I understand there will be a lot of Celtic and Rangers fans, maybe Hibs and Aberdeen fans, who will be laughing and saying ‘we’ve heard it all before’,” he blathered. “I just thought there was an opportunity here to shake things up in Scotland. I think we’ve got a very good chance of at least being second this season. I’ve just got a lot more confidence of what Hearts can do compared to when I did my first press conference at Union seven years ago.”Bloom has wasted no time in bringing in a new striker, Cláudio Braga, who (very much in the Brighton ilk) was signed from Norwegian second-division side FK Aalesunds for around £400,000. The Portuguese bagged four goals in five pre-season matches – including one in a 3-0 win over Premier League Sunderland – and already has a chant among the Tynecastle faithful:“All we need is … Cláudio Braga,”set to the tune of the Queen classic. Sunshine on Leith it is not, but Hearts fans will be getting goosebumps regardless.QUOTE OF THE DAYA couple of friends had come over to see me, we were chatting, and suddenly they said they couldn’t understand what I was saying.

He earned the nickname Animal from teammate Fernando Couto during their partnership in central defence. As captain, he led Porto to Uefa Cup glory in 2003 and a Champions League triumph in 2004 under manager José Mourinho.“It’s part of my history that goes,” an emotional Mourinho said at Fenerbahce’s press conference ahead of Wednesday’s Champions League qualifier against Feyenoord in Rotterdam.“You have captains, you have leaders. It’s not about the armband, it’s about what you represent. Jorge was one of these guys I used to say ‘clean the garbage’ and let the coach do his job as a coach and not as a leader of the dressing room.View image in fullscreenJorge Costa (left) and Vitor Baia arrive at Porto airport after the 2004 Champions League final win over Monaco.Photograph: Miguel Riopa/AFP/Getty Images“That’s perfection for a coach when the captain does this work. Of course I’m very sad, but let’s forget football. Let’s focus on him, Jorge, a young guy and his kids that I met when they were really kids and now, of course, they are grown men.“Of course I am very sad but I’m here because if he could speak with me now he would tell me: ‘Come on, do your press conference and tomorrow play the game and win mister. Forget about me’. That would be Jorge. So that’s what I am going to try to do. Do my job today, do my job tomorrow, and then cry after.”Costa was one of six players to win five consecutive Portuguese league championships with Porto, alongside Aloísio, Ljubinko Drulović, Paulinho Santos, Rui Barros and Folha.Costa returned to the club in April 2024 as director under their new president André Villas-Boas. “Jorge Costa’s legacy will always remain alive in the memory of all Porto fans. You will never be forgotten, Captain,” the club added.Charlton Athletic, the London club where Costa spent half the 2001-02 season on loan to play Premier League football, making 24 appearances, released a short social media statement, saying: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of former player Jorge Costa at the age of 53. The thoughts of everyone at Charlton Athletic are with Jorge’s family and friends at this difficult time.”Explore more on these topicsPortoPortugalnewsShareReuse this content"

Larson was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1995 for involvement in drug dealing and rebuilt his career as a caddie for several leadingPGA Tourplayers after serving 10 years.Scottie Scheffler claims Open Championship with majestic four-shot winRead moreLarson’s past had been largely forgotten until the Scottish Open, when it was revealed that any American citizen given a custodial sentence of at least 12 months will now be denied UK entry. ETA implementation started in January this year.Larson was refused travel despite lobbying to the Home Office from the PGA Tour and the R&A. English tied 22nd in Scotland and finished second in the Open. Caddies typically receive around 10% of their player’s winnings; English earned more than £1.8m from his UK trip. As things stand, Larson will encounter the same situation in 2026.The American bodies will point to the fact thatDonald Trump’s ban on citizensfrom a dozen countries entering the US – another seven have been served with restrictions – contains an exemption intended to apply to players, staff or associated families linked to the 2026 Fifa World Cup or the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games. No such leeway exists presently for the UK border.“Sporting bodies are now asking the UK to apply sporting exemptions on this system,” a senior figure within US sport said. The Home Office did not offer comment on whether it has already been asked to apply sporting exemptions on the ETA and what any response towards this might be.A source with knowledge of the Home Office position said: “Each application for a decision outside the rules is considered on its merits but informed by previous examples and precedents.”The same source confirmed the “mandatory and automatic refusal of entry clearance for individuals who have received a previous custodial sentence of at least 12 months”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Newcastle had appeared to be within touching distance of a deal for the 22-year-old butManchester Unitedmade a rival bid on Tuesday and believe the player would prefer a move to Old Trafford.Newcastle submitteda second offer for Sesko of £69.7m, which with add-ons could rise to almost £75m, after receiving encouragement that he was potentially open to a transfer to Tyneside. But cautious optimism at St James’ Park regarding an agreement was caveated by Manchester United’s interest.Manchester United’s bid is of a guaranteed £65.2m, rising to a possible £73.8m. They have been pursuing a striker all summer and missed out on targets including Viktor Gyökeres, Hugo Ekitiké and Liam Delap.Manchester United have spent more than £130mon Bryan Mbeumoand Matheus Cunha this summer and previous indications have been that they would need to sell at least one of Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia if they were to spend big again.Newcastle were also keen on Ekitiké and Delap, and it would be another significant transfer blow for them if Sesko were to end up at Old Trafford. With Eddie Howe’s first‑choice centre-forward Alexander Isak having made plain his desire to leave, ideally for Liverpool, Newcastle are in the market for two forwards. Negotiations with Brentford are ongoing regarding Yoane Wissa, and Howe is also a longstanding admirer of Aston Villa’s Ollie Watkins.Newcastle’s negotiations with Leipzig have been led by the director and minority owner Jamie Reuben, who has stepped in to assist Howe’s nephew Andy Howe with recruitment in the absence of a sporting director.Isak is scheduled for talks with Howe this week but chances of a real rapprochement look slender. After the Swedemissed Newcastle’s tourof Singapore and South Korea citing a minor thigh problem apparently undetectable on scans, and took the unilateral decision to train alone at his former club Real Sociedad, it is hard to envisage Isak playing for the club again. Liverpool’s £110m bid for him was rejected last week.Howe said before leaving Seoul that he had known nothing of Isak’s trip to Spain and warned that players exhibiting “poor behaviour” would not be permitted to train with his first team. The Newcastle manager described the situation as “far from ideal”.A series of potential signings, also including João Pedro and James Trafford, have turned down Newcastle but Howe, who is preparing for a Champions League campaign, has signed the Sweden winger Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest for £55m and the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan from Southampton.Ramsdale’s arrival appears to have opened the door for Martin Dubravka to depart, with the Slovakia goalkeeper in advanced talks over a move to Burnley.Howe is also in the market for a right-sided centre-half and, should funds be released by Isak departing, Newcastle could revive a longstanding interest in Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi.View image in fullscreenMarc Guéhi in action for Crystal Palace against Mainz in a pre-season friendly.Photograph: Marco Steinbrenner/DeFodi Images/ShutterstockWith Newcastle not thought to be Guéhi’s first-choice destination a deal could be difficult and Marseille’s Argentinian centre-half Leonardo Balerdi remains high on Howe’s shortlist. Newcastle have made repeated attempts to recruit the defender Giorgio Scalvini from Atalanta but have been persistently rebuffed.Guéhi is understood to be willing to stay at Selhurst Parkand see out his contract, which expires next summer. Liverpool are believed to be his preferred option, although they are reluctant to pay Palace’s £40m valuation. Palace rejected an offer worth up to £70m from Tottenham in January and are facing the possibility of the England international leaving on a free transfer.Explore more on these topicsFootballEddie HoweNewcastle UnitedManchester UnitednewsShareReuse this content"

While 78% said comfort was a top priority, nearly nine in 10 spoke of discomfort.“The findings of our many years of research and development … illustrate the inequities that women athletes face when it comes to footwear,” Laura Youngson, co‑founder and chief executive of IDA Sports, said. “We hope that the findings of this study will not only draw attention to the impactful data, but push more brands to invest in women athletes as we have proudly done over the last seven years.”About 45% of players surveyed said they specifically experienced pain under the first metatarsal bone, above their big toe. This is conventionally the location for a stud on a boot intended for a man.Youngson has said that female players will often file down the stud under the toe to reduce the pressure on the bone and IDA Sports adopted a different template for the studs on its female-centred boots.Sports scientists have also drawn attention to the risk of injury from studs not adapted specifically for women. Women’s feet and arches are shaped differently to men and women also run in a different way. Studs under the metatarsal can risk injuring the bone, but also possibly increase the chance of damaging ligaments.Dr Matt Whalan, a consultant to Fifa on female health in football and a principal partner at Figtree Physiotherapy, explained these risks to the Guardianin a 2020 interview. “The simplest thing to do is to look at the contact with the ground and the step/pivot/twist,” he said. “There’s maybe a 10-kilo weight difference between male and female footballers and we’re going to put them in a same boot, that has the same traction, the same stiffness and that needs the same muscle capacity to control the traction that that boot will give.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Cowboys owner has once again fumbled a contract negotiation with one of his stars. Despite fellow 2021 draftees Penei Sewell, Patrick Surtain II and Ja’Marr Chase signing long-term extensions, the Cowboys have allowed talks with Parsons to drag on.Last week, Parsons accused Jones of trying tocircumvent his agent in negotiationsandformally requested a trade.Jerry Jones downplays Micah Parsons’ public comments as teammates rally to player’s sideRead moreIt’s fun to imagine Parsons on the trade block. What kind of haul could the Cowboys get in a trade? Three first-round picks? Two? Would the Bills make a move? The Rams? Is there a team thatwouldn’tcall? But let’s be clear: Parsons isn’t going anywhere.“It’s a negotiating tactic,” Jones said after Parsons’ request. For once, Jerry is right. Myles Garrett submitted a trade request to the Browns in February. A month later, he signed a $160m extension. In a league with thefranchise tag, a public trade request is one of the only levers a player can pull in negotiations. Parsons is simply playing his part in the public charade.This shouldn’t be difficult. As a pass-rusher, Parsons is a one-man inferno. At times last season, he single-handedly bailed out Dallas’ defense. Oh, and he is just 26 years old, slap-bang in his prime. Negotiations should have been as simple as putting the biggest non-quarterback contract in league history on the table and popping the champagne. Yet Jones has spent the offseason taking odd shots at his best player, from questioning (incorrectly) Parsons’ injury history, to freezing his agent out of discussions, to debating why he would signanyplayer to a four or five-year contract. “You can get hit by a car, seriously,” Jones said at one point. Seriously.By allowing talks to drag on, the Cowboys have watched Parsons’ value creep up. The edge-rushing market has ballooned this offseason, first with Garrett and then TJ Watt signing a massive extension. Last year, the Cowboys could have locked Parsons into a deal worth $34m a year. Now, the price will be closer to $42m. The Cowboys will eventually cave – as they always do. They’ll agree on a new deal on the eve of the new season, after lighting their training camp on fire and scoring Jones some headlines.View image in fullscreenJJ McCarthy is tasked with leading a talented Vikings team on a postseason run.Photograph: Abbie Parr/APJJ McCarthyThe Vikings have a championship-caliber roster. They have elite skill players. They are loaded on both sides of the line of scrimmage. They have a top-five coaching staff. The only lingering question: their quarterback.How McCarthy slots into the Vikings’ offense is perhaps the most important variable in the championship race. The No 10 pick in the 2024 draft missed his rookie season with a knee injury, while Sam Darnold caught fire in relief –until he didn’t. Minnesota could have run it back with Darnold after a 14-win season, giving them a buffer to the McCarthy era. They didn’t. They bet on their infrastructure, allowing Darnold to walk and clearing the path for McCarthy.It’s a risk. Multiple playoff winsshould bethe expectation this year. And if McCarthy can be a solid starter in his debut season, the Vikings will have legitimate title aspirations.If you asked the computer to simulate the perfect circumstances for a first-year starter, it would probably produce something like what the Vikings offer. Head coach Kevin O’Connell has consistently produced high-wattage passing attacks, helping to generate easy chunk plays regardless of who is at quarterback. Justin Jefferson is the game’s best receiver, Jordan Addison is a solid second option and tight end TJ Hockenson is a difference-maker when healthy. Minnesota also spent the bulk of the offseason upgrading both lines, notably adding Ryan Kelly and Will Fries from the Colts on the offensive side, one of the craftiest interior line tandems in the league. If there were deficiencies last year, it was the team’s run game and conceding pressure up the middle. The new duo, along with rookie Donovan Jackson, should help patch over those issues.There were changes on defense, too. Brian Flores’ wackadoodle scheming carried the Vikings through tough stretches last season. This year, his unit is deeper and more explosive, with veterans Jonathan Allen and Javon Hargrave offering extra punch up front. The Vikings can now toggle between Flores’s bizarro looks and more basic set-ups, and should challenge the Eagles and Broncos to be the top defense in the league.With Joe Burrow and a too-familiar cast, the Bengals’ Super Bowl window is closing fastRead moreIf McCarthy does nothing but limit turnovers, the Vikings should keep pace with the rest of the NFC North. They will hope for more than that, but hammering away with the run game, hitting play-action shots and letting the defense feast is a viable path to the postseason. McCarthy thrived in that same environment at Michigan. If he plays with accuracy and keeps the offense churning, the Vikings will be a playoff force.The Browns’ quarterback circusWhat can you say about the Browns? There are banana republics with more stable leadership than Cleveland. It’s early August, so it’s not a full-scale disaster … yet. But thetraining camp reportsmake for grim reading.Shedeur Sanders to start Browns’ preseason opener against PanthersRead moreFor a team in desperate need of a viable long-term starter,double-dipping on quarterbacks in the draftmade sense. But the Browns now have a bloated quarterback competition, featuring 40-year-old Joe Flacco, a limping Kenny Pickett, and two underbaked rookies, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. No pressure, Kevin Stefanski (on Monday night,reports emergedthey are signinganotherquarterback, Tyler Huntley, because all of the unit bar Flacco are carrying injuries).Flacco is the nominal starter, despite team owner Jimmy Haslam saying he expects to see both rookies play at some point this season. Gabriel has received a ton of practice reps with the first team, but the early returns have beenscattershot at best.Cleveland may hold on to all four quarterbacks into the regular season, unless one of the rookies grabs the starting gig in preseason, freeing up the team to move on from Pickett or Flacco. Chucking rookie quarterbacks into the mayhem to figure out what you have sounds like a fine idea until they line up behind a depleted group. Whoever winds up as the starter will be playing with an ad hoc roster: the offensive line is a mixture of fossilized former Pro Bowlers and projects; there is a lack of reliable pass-catchers outside of Jerry Jeudy and David Njoku.If you’re looking for positives, watch the defense. The Browns have plenty of talent on that side of the ball, but even some of that has already been stripped away by injuries and a late retirement.It’s shaping up to be a messy year. Once, the Browns were fun upstarts. Now, they’re a depressing mystery again. If the team stumbles early, Stefanski could be out of a job by Thanksgiving.View image in fullscreenMike McDaniel could find himself under pressure in Miami.Photograph: Lynne Sladky/APMiami temperature checkSpeaking of hot seats. Mike McDaniel’sseat in Miami is pretty toasty. After reaching the playoffs twice in McDaniel’s first two seasons, the Dolphins fell apart last season. They were undone by injuries again, only this time it was the defense that disintegrated.They did little in the offseason to fill you with confidence. Terron Armstead, the team’s franchise left tackle, retired. The offensive line still looks rickety. Jalen Ramsey was traded. Tyreek Hill kept up hison-again, off-againrelationship with a trade request, although now he’s committed tostudying.Miami’s offense will continue to produce fireworks, thanks largely to McDaniel, Hill, Tua Tagovailoa, Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane. And on paper, at least, the Dolphins have one of the most talented defensive front-sevens in the sport. Jaelen Phillips, Bradley Chubb, Zach Sieler, Chop Robinson and Kenneth Grant could form one of the nastiest pass-rushes in the league. Still, the balance of the remaining roster is dicey.Heading into the season, Miami’s secondary is the flakiest position group in the league. Acquiring Minkah Fitzpatrick in the Ramsey trade will help, but he is the group’s only proven starter. They already lost their top cornerback, Kader Kohou, for the season with a knee injury.Miami brought in Mike Hilton from the scrapheap to replace Kohou and will rely on Ifeatu Melifonwu and Ashtyn Davis, two safeties with shaky injury records, to play alongside Fitzpatrick. Storm Duck, currently slated to start, was a fun story a year ago as an undrafted free agent, but he was torched in meaningful snaps as a rookie. You know you’re in trouble when Jack Jones, a fringe starter, goes from unemployed to a team’s premier corner in 10 days.The hope is that the team’s pass-rush will be so overwhelming that it can mitigate the impact of the secondary. But, at some point, it will be third-and-medium and someone in the secondary will need to make a play. Only Fitzpatrick is a dynamic playmaker, and he is on the downside of his career.The Dolphins haven’t won a playoff game since 2000. If they miss the postseason again, McDaniel will probably be out. And the current roster has too many holes to be a serious threat to the Bills in the East.The NFC West’s logjamTake a look at the NFC West. It’s stacked, comfortably the most competitive division in the league.The Rams came close to bouncing the Eagles in the playoffs last season with a young roster and have reloaded this year. The Niners remade their defense after last season’s injury apocalypse. The Cardinals are no longer just an interesting side show; they have a bruising offense and aspicy defense. The Seahawks closed last season strong, putting together a top-five defense from Week 10 onwards, and could have one of the best units in the league this season.There are no slouches. The weakest singleunitin the division may be the Seahawks’ offense, and that could still crack the top half of the league. How the division shakes out will probably come down to how quickly Darnold can assimilate in Seattle. Was his career-best year in Minnesota a mirage? Will his talented but unproven offensive line hold up? Can a receiver room of Cooper Kupp, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Jaxon Smith-Njigba offset the losses of DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett? As ever, there are also the annual concerns aboutMatthew Stafford’s injury statusto throw into the NFC mix. But if Darnold’s resurgence carries over and Stafford is healthy, then all four teams will have quality starting quarterbacks and spiky defenses. It’s going to be a bloodbath.Aaron Rodgers’ last danceBuckle up, folks. You have one more season of Rodgers to deal with.Yes, Rodgers in Pittsburgh could be a farce. It probablywillbe a farce. The Steelers’ decision to sign a 41-year-old Rodgers, who is two years removed from an achilles injury, after Pittsburgh *deep breath* traded for DK Metcalf, signed the receiver to a bumper extension, traded away George Pickens, benched Justin Fields for Russell Wilson, then told Fields that he was Their Guy, then told Wilson to take the first plane out of town, then lost Fields in free agency, then traded for Jalen Ramsey, then signed TJ Watt to a market-resetting extension is the kind of teenager-on-Madden approach to team-building usually reserved for the Jaguars, Panthers orthe son of a Jets owner.It is weird to reach this point: somehow, the vaunted Steelers have become the league’smost directionless franchise. But the Steelers areconvinced they have the backbone of a championship contender. “We’re building this team to win a Super Bowl this year,” GM Omar Khansaid recently.It’s easy to chuckle at the Steelers assembling a 2022 All-Pro squad (hand up). But there’s a path to at least division contention here. If Ramsey is even 70% of the player he was in his prime, he will be a linchpin on an already outstanding defense. Whether the offense can match the defense will come down to Rodgers’ connection with offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, two stubborn offensive designers withdivergent styles.Rodgers probably won’t guide the Steelers to a Super Bowl. He looked a shadow of himself last season: hesitant to stand in the pocket, worried about getting hit, unable to avoid the rush as his accuracy dwindled to key parts of the field. But if Rodgers can stay healthy, he could perhaps Peyton Manning his way through a final season, keeping the Steelers competitive as they try to bridge one team to the next. If the on-field stuff turns out to be a disaster, his lasting legacy in Pittsburgh may be convincing Mike Tomlin that more substantive changes are needed.Explore more on these topicsNFLDallas CowboysMinnesota VikingsCleveland BrownsMiami DolphinsPittsburgh SteelersAaron RodgersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While some players in white fell to their knees or collapsed crying into the arms of coaching staff, the 26-year-old, with scrunched-up shorts, exited stage left to head to the United States and the global stage of the Club World Cup with Egypt’s Al-Ahly, after impressing so much on the African and Asian one.Now, after this busiest of summers, the Danish-born star has signed forColumbus Crew– a No 9 for one of MLS’s best teams in need of one, and one who takes up one of the team’s allotment of designated player spots, to boot.Those designations tend to carry some weight inMLS, but pressure is not going to be an issue for one of the Middle East’s newest stars. This is a player who collapsed on the pitch due to a sudden spike in heart rate in 2021 while in action for Vendsyssel FF in Denmark before waking up in an ambulance and being out of action for nine months. Within weeks of his return, he suffered another serious injury, including fractured ribs and a punctured lung. After undergoing surgery, the rangy striker admitted that he had thought about giving it all up but returned with a renewed conviction. He has been making up for lost time ever since.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That earned a significant move in January 2024 to Al-Ahly – regarded by most as the biggest club in Africa, with demanding fans and a media dominated by impatient and critical ex-players. He made it look easy. Despite arriving in Cairo well after the Egyptian Premier League season started, Abou Ali grabbed the 2024-25 golden boot with 18 goals. As well as the individual prize, he helped the team to a league and a Caf Champions League title. In all, he managed 35 goals and 10 assists in just 57 appearances for the Red Giants. He couldn’t quite help Al-Ahly to a second successive Champions League triumph, as they fell at the semi-final stage on away goals in May. There was little time to dwell on that, though, as he was off to help Palestine qualify for a first World Cup.Abou Ali represented Denmark at the youth level but due to his obvious talent, heritage and public support of Palestine, he had long been on the radar ofThe Fedayeen. His debut came in 2024, at the end of the second round of World Cup qualification in Asia and Palestine’s place in the third round for the first time ever, to fight it out with 17 nations for the biggest of prizes. Despite all the challenges that the team faced on the road to 2026, not least having to play every game on foreign soil due to the situation at home, that Palestine came so close to reaching the playoffs was a testament to spirit, skill and determination. “It would be a dream to go to the World Cup,” Abou Ali said in June. “It would mean so much to everyone.”He quickly became the cutting edge, scoring four of the team’s 10 goals in the third round, including one of the most famous strikes in Palestine’s history. To get to the World Cup playoffs, only three wins from the last three group games would do. Being 1-0 down in the first of those to Iraq with just minutes to go in March was not ideal but then Abou Ali, whose physicality had caused problems all night, timed his run perfectly to meet a corner at the near post to head into the opposite side of the net.A dramatic and wildly celebrated winnersoon followed.MLS teams are losing their home field advantage – and that’s no bad thingRead moreThen it was to Kuwait on 5 June, another must-win game at the home of a team in the same situation. Palestine were already a goal to the good when Abou Ali, shorts scrunched up, stepped up to stroke home a penalty that sealed the victory to keep the dream alive for five more days, before it was ended by Oman thanks to a late spot kick.As the Palestine FA made an official complaint to Fifa about Oman’s penalty, Abou Ali was already off to the United States and the Fifa Club World Cup. For Al-Ahly, there was a perfect hat-trick against Porto, an incredible feat for a Palestinian international playing for an Egyptian club against a former European champion. Reports in Egypt talked of more and more interest and more and more bids. Al-Ahly fans took to social media to implore the star to stay and were devastated when he did not, testament to the impact that he has had on such a huge stage in a short space of time.From Cairo to Columbus via World Cup and Club World Cup heartbreak and much more besides, Wessam Abou Ali is a major star on the planet’s two biggest continents and is ready for a third. There is a sense that he is just getting started.Explore more on these topicsColumbus CrewMLSUS sportsAl AhlyPalestinefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I felt like that I am going to be super busy. Me and my family thought it would probably be of best interest to not accept that. I was definitely a little shocked when my name was mentioned. I’m assuming it’s something great, so I appreciate it but was a little shocked when my name was mentioned.”Why are members of the Super Bowl champion Eagles promoting a right-wing Christian wealth scheme?Read moreTrump last week reestablished the Presidential Fitness Test for American children, a fixture of public schools for decades that gauged young people’s health and athleticism with one-mile runs, sit-ups and stretching exercises.“This is a wonderful tradition, and we’re bringing it back,” Trump said of the fitness test that began in 1966 but was phased out during the Obama administration.The executive order also reinvigorated the national sports council that could have included Barkley. Barkley won AP Offensive Player of the Year last season after rushing for 2,005 yards, eighth-best inNFLhistory, in his first season with the Eagles.Barkley has golfed with Trump and Barack Obama over the last year and the running back attended the White House celebration of the champion Eagles while some teammates – notably star quarterback Jalen Hurts –skipped the ceremony.Barkley visited Trump in April at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, and caught a ride with the president to Washington on Air Force One and then to the White House on Marine One.“He loved it,” Trump said then of Barkley’s short flight on the presidential airplane. “He’s a great young guy and an incredible football player. Saquon had a season for the ages, running behind the most powerful offensive line in the NFL.”Barkley, meanwhile, pushed back on social media criticism following the visit. He noted that he had already golfed with Obama.“Maybe I just respect the office, not a hard concept to understand,” Barkley posted on X.Explore more on these topicsPhiladelphia EaglesNFLDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Bad though that is, it’s not the worst example in this lucidly laid out and often harrowing indictment of social media’s ruthlessness; that would be the proliferation of drug dealers on Snapchat, which the company seems to have to some extent turned a blind eye to in the scramble to expand its user base.Based on the investigative work of Bloomberg journalist Olivia Carville, this film covers the attempts ofminnow legal outfit Social Media Victims Law Centerto net the sharks of Silicon Valley. It represents a host of families who have suffered heartbreaking losses due to unpoliced extreme online content: children and teenagers who fatally copied auto-asphyxiation or pro-suicide videos, ones who killed themselves after falling victim to sextortionists, or who overdosed after buying off-prescription meds from predatory dealers. The battle here is to overcome section 230, a get-out clause in the 1996 Telecommunication Act that gives social media companies immunity for third-party-generated content. Of course, Mark Zuckerberg was still slurping Slush Puppies back then.Matthew Bergman, the center’s founder, twice makes the analogy with cigarette companies, arguing that social media companies knowingly prioritise profit over the health of their users. If the film is clear about this causation and the resulting damage, it is not a given that the team can make a longer leap: from establishing a degree of culpability in individual cases and getting justice and closure for these families, to proving that the tech companies systematically predicate their algorithms on fanning our most negative tendencies and impulses. The big victory here is stopping theSnapchatcase being dismissed due to section 230; more of a minor triumph that shows the scale of the mountain, but you have to start somewhere.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.However, even squeezing in “brisk walks” can be a chore, with busy schedules and increasingly desk-bound jobs forcing more of us to remain sedentary for long periods. That is where walking pads come in, being lighter, smaller and often easier to store than bulky and tricky-to-manoeuvre running treadmills.When coupled with a standing desk, walking pads can be used while working – or when watching TV in the evening. Just a couple of 30-minute sessions add thousands of steps to your daily tally. In fact, a 60-minute walk at an easy 3km an hour can burn between 200 and 300 additional calories, helping those who want to improve their fitness and tone up without the sweatiness and inconvenience of a full-on treadmill session.Walking pads are often cheaper than full-size treadmills, simple to use and relatively easy to store, and they’re perfect for adding more movement to your life without having to give up the day job.At a glanceBestwalking pad overall:JTX MoveLight£449 at JTX FitnessBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmill£142.49 at DebenhamsBest walking pad for beginners:Urevo Strol 2E£169.98 at AmazonBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60£549 at AmazonBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus£224.99 at MobvoiWhy you should trust meI’m a keen fitness fan who does everything from gym-based strength training and kickboxing classes to outdoor trail runs and cold-water surfing. As a result, I’ve often been tasked with testing fitness technology for industry magazines.I’ve always been one to get stuck in, whatever I’m testing, whether that means surfing in the latest smartwatch or feeling the burn to test a set of connected kettlebells.I’m a strong believer that you need to live with new-fangled tech to get a grasp of how it fits into daily life, so I’ve always sought to test a product for as long as possible and in the right environment. With walking pads, that meant strolling along, racking up the steps and burning calories – even while I wrote up this feature.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘Good build quality for the price, and the setup process is painless’: the Mobvoi Home Treadmill Plus.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianThere was only one way to properly trial the five walking treadmills we selected for this test, and that’s to mimic the customer journey by ordering, taking delivery, unboxing, setting them up and then shoehorning them into daily life.The best walking treadmills – or walking pads – aren’t quite as bulky asregular running treadmills, so I could have multiple models on the go at home at once: one under my desk, one in front of the television and one in my wife’s office upstairs, rotating through them to ensure the same time – at least three days – was spent on each.The testing process meant a lot of additional steps and – in some cases at least – a whining soundtrack that drowned out whatever Netflix series the family was attempting to enjoy. Besides general observations on the heft, ease of storage, quietness, ease of operation and build quality, I tested any additional features available, such as incline, speed adjustments and any remote controls or apps.To get a good idea of energy consumption and the overall cost of running a walking treadmill, I plugged each unit into a power meter, which offered real-time readouts on energy use, and calculated the cost based on my energy tariff.Here are the five best walking treadmills you can buy now.The best under-desk treadmills and walking pads in 2025View image in fullscreen‘It feels like a walking pad that will go the distance’: the JTX MoveLight.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianBest overall walking pad:JTX MoveLightView image in fullscreen£449 at JTX Fitness£499 at AmazonJTX tends to appear in the “best value” section of most reviews of home fitness equipment. The brand is known for offering affordability and reliable build quality, but lacks eye candy and technological flourishes.The MoveLight walking pad is different, though. It happens to be one of the most expensive walking pads we tested. At almost 30kg, it’s also one of the heaviest.That’s no bad thing, though: there’s a tangible difference in the build quality when compared with the much cheaper Rattantree, for example. The JTX also offers a super-sized display, cushioned walking deck and quiet 1hp electric motor. It’s a solid treadmill offering speeds of up to 6km/h, meaning it’s possible to use it for slow jogging without the worry of it falling apart.Why we love itThe JTX is similar in design to the BodyMax reviewed below and has a solid plastic chassis that gives it a more premium feel than its cheaper rivals. There’s also a generous running deck area.The extra-large LED console is easy to use and neatly scrolls through speed, time and step count information as you walk. The shrill beeps upon startup and when you adjust the speed do become tiresome, though. Any office mates will want to throw a pencil at you.A small plastic remote allows you to adjust the speed, stop or start the unit and scroll the display between distance, calories and time on one half, and speed and step count on the other.The 1hp motor is powerful enough to propel the deck up to 6km/h, where it remains much quieter than some of the others tested. The deck cushioning is also tangible underfoot, offering a nice spring that makes longer walking sessions more comfortable.Overall, it feels like a walking pad that will go the distance – and so it should, given the price. But that solid build also makes it a pain to move around the house, with the overall weight requiring some serious muscle to tip it up on to its wheels. It also doesn’t fold like the similarly priced BodyMax machine.Oh, and one final public service announcement: those with wooden floors will want to take care that the wheels and plastic feet don’t scratch the surface during transport.During testing, we found it to be slightly more power-hungry than rivals, supping about 100W at 3.5km/h, meaning it costs about 3p an hour to power – or about 90p a month if used for an hour each day.It’s a shame that …it’s so big and heavy to move around, which makes storing it after each session a chore.Size:147 x 60 x 12.5cm (LWH)Weight:29.5kgWalking deck size:45 x 122cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:3p/hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:noBestbudget walking pad:Rattantree shock-absorbing treadmillView image in fullscreen£142.49 at Debenhams£151.99 at BoohooManIt was a bit of a surprise when this Rattantree treadmill arrived sporting HomeFitnessCode branding. It’s a mega-value, fairly generic option that hails from China, and it’s no surprise that it doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of its pricier rivals. The build quality isn’t fantastic, but it is very lightweight, an absolute doddle to use and covers the basics required by most working walkers.It’s marketed for walking and running, with the belt managing speeds of up to 10km/h, but this feels extremely fast for such a barebones machine.Why we love itLet’s get straight to the point: this is a budget option. It’s much cheaper than most of the others tested and doesn’t come with any fancy features such as Bluetooth, incline or built-in speakers.It’s a simple 39 x 104cm revolving running deck, paired with a powerful (but noisy) 2.5hp electric motor that’s able to crank the belt up to 10km/h. Speed adjustment is taken care of by a small remote, which needs two AAA batteries to operate.Upon unboxing, the cost savings are immediately obvious. It is not only light but also basic in its build. A simple steel frame, a motor and a belt are about all you get.A small and often tricky-to-read LED console at the top scrolls through distance travelled, time elapsed and a rough guide to how many calories you’ve burned, but there’s no way of jumping to the data field you want. You just have to wait for it to come around again.The lighter overall weight makes it much easier to move around the house than others, but I found it also started to move around underfoot, creak and generally complain a little as the speeds went beyond 8km/h. Put it this way: I don’t think this lightweight walking pad would last an indoor marathon at a training pace.As a simple walking pad to tuck under a desk, though, it’s absolutely fine. The belt needed adjusting after about a week of use, but slurping just 70W of power at 3.5km/h means it costs pennies to use daily.It’s a shame that …it cranks up to speeds of 10km/h because it doesn’t feel sturdy enough for those speeds.Size:122 x 49 x 14cm (LWH)Weight:19kgMaximum user weight:109kgAverage running cost:2p/hourWalking deck size:39 x 104cmIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:noBest walking pad for beginners:Urevo Strol 2EView image in fullscreen£169.98 at AmazonIt’s difficult to separate the Strol 2E from the Mobvoi below, with both opting for a slimline, folding handle design that allows them to transform from simple under-desk walking pads to more traditional running treadmills.Built of sturdier stuff than its doppelganger, the Strol also brings an impressive digital offering into the mix with the Urevo smartphone and tablet app. This provides free virtual walks and collates daily, weekly and monthly workout information.With an impressively quiet and powerful 2.25hp electric motor and plenty of shock absorption underfoot, it’s a great way to rack up additional steps during the day, whether from speedier walking sessions or even light jogs.Why we love itAside from representing excellent value for money, the Strol 2E is smaller, easier to store and less of a task to move around the house than some of its counterparts. Its slim profile means it will slip under a sofa or bed when not in use.The downside of this is a small walking deck, which is particularly lacking in length. This makes it easy to run out of room if you have longer legs, and makes faster running sessions particularly awkward for anyone taller than 5ft. Urevo opts for a folding handle that flips up in running mode. This includes a magnetic safety catch that clips to your clothes and automatically shuts off the unit if you inadvertently run out of deck space.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The free-to-download app offers virtual walks and allows you to set workouts based on time, step and calorie goals. You can control the speed of the treadmill from your phone or tablet, or use a slick remote control that can also turn off the annoying beeps at the press of a button.It comes with a plastic device holder that can be clipped on to the safety handle for bingeing Netflix or enjoying one of those scenic virtual tours – although you’ll need headphones because there’s no built-in speaker. For the price, it’s an accomplished package and excellent value for money.It’s a shame that …the belt is so short, making it awkward to run on. Taller users will probably find the walking deck too small for longer strides, too.Size:122 x 57 x 99cm (LWH)Weight:21.4kgWalking deck size:38 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgAverage running cost:3p/hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:10km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningBest foldable walking pad:BodyMax WP60View image in fullscreen£549 at AmazonThe most expensive model on test, the BodyMax walking pad also happens to be one of the best built and easiest on the eye. It’s the only model that genuinely folds in half, making it easier to squeeze into a cupboard or wardrobe.However, weighing the best part of 30kg, it’s not the easiest to move, despite wheels at the front that allow it to be tipped on its end and rolled around.Potential portability issues aside, this machine offers a fantastic walking experience, with a neat, bright and easy-to-read LED panel that gives clear and scrolling readouts of workout time, distance, speed and average calorie burn.Very much the Porsche of the walking pad world, the BodyMax unit combines stylish looks and powerful performance – but it does require deep pockets.Why we love itLike most walking pads tested here, it comes with a small remote control to adjust the speed, but there’s also a clever automatic mode – or A Mode – that senses the foot placement and automatically adjusts the speed.Remain in the middle of the deck, and the walking pad will keep the same pace; walk towards the front, and it speeds up; hang back, and it slows things down. This is a really handy feature, meaning you won’t be constantly distracted by irksome remote-control fiddling.The deck itself is nicely cushioned, and the motor is among the quietest on test. It feels like BodyMax hasn’t scrimped on materials, nor has it been distracted by Bluetooth speakers and other gimmicks, which can’t be said for all.Those wanting their walking pad to double up as a running treadmill may be disappointed: the WP60 tops out at 6km/h, which is a very fast walking pace but a slow jog for most. Not a single walking pad I’ve tested has done a convincing job as a running treadmill, though, being either too flimsy underfoot, too noisy or simply not built to withstand the endless thumping of a sprint session.If you’re seeking robust build quality, the BodyMax WP60 walking pad is well worth the additional outlay. As it folds in half, it can be tucked under a desk or rested against a wall when not in use.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy and awkward to move around when folded, and it’s expensive.Size:143 x 55 x 13cm (LWH)Weight:28kgWalking deck size:42 x 120cmMaximum user weight:100kgAverage running cost:2.5p/hourIncline:noneMaximum speed:6km/hFolding:yes, folds in half for storageBest walking pad for incline:Mobvoi Home Treadmill PlusView image in fullscreen£224.99 at MobvoiMobvoi is best known for itsTicWatchline of fitness-tracking smartwatches and good-valuewireless headphones, but it also offers a small range of domestic treadmills in the UK.One of the most versatile is the Home Treadmill Plus. This pad offers a slightly larger walking deck area than the brand’sHome Treadmill SE, as well as the ability to add a small amount of incline thanks to flip-out feet for height.The build quality is good for the price, and the setup process is painless, while a decent spread of speeds and the ability to transform it into a more traditional running machine (with a folding handrail) make it a versatile choice for home users.Why we love itMobvoi manages to make its Home Treadmill Plus feel relatively premium and well built without sending the price soaring.It’s ready to use out of the box (although that box is heavy, so get someone to help), with wheels at one end to make it easier to move around the home – especially if you have hard floors. You wouldn’t want to keep lugging it up and down the stairs, though.When “folded” into walking mode, the built-in handrail lies flat, allowing you to slide it under a standing desk. From here, you control it with a small remote control to adjust the speed and turn the machine on and off.It doesn’t fold in half for storage, but the slim side profile means it will slide under a sofa or bed, so long as you have 12cm or more of clearance.It includes a safety mechanism for running that clips to your clothes and attaches to a specific point on the machine with a strong magnet, as you’d get on a gym running machine. There’s no way of safely attaching it when the handrail is tucked away in walking mode, however, so it will continue to operate even if you step off it. Most walking pads are the same, but it always strikes me as a bit dangerous.When extending the handrail and pushing the 2.5hp electric motor to its 12km/h top speed, however, that emergency cord could well come in handy. While it’s nice that it reaches a running pace that’s so fast – feeling like a sprint for many – it’s not really designed for long and arduous sprint sessions. The running deck isn’t big enough, and there isn’t much in the way of shock absorption. I tried running on a couple of occasions but always found the experience a tad claustrophobic, not to mention noisy and generally a bit flimsy-feeling underfoot – particularly when maxing out the speed.The pad does offer an efficient and quiet way of racking up the step count while engaging in side tasks. The fold-out incline legs are a nice touch because adding a small incline helps burn more calories and work different leg muscles.In terms of efficiency, I found it drew around 80W of power at a sedate 3.5km/h speed, meaning it will cost a couple of pence to run for an hour a day on most common tariffs.Other niceties include Bluetooth functionality, allowing it to pair with virtual workout software such asZwift, while a built-in speaker allows music to be streamed from a smartphone. That said, the speaker isn’t great – you’d be far better off with a good pair ofheadphonesinstead.It’s a shame that …it’s heavy to move around, the remote is hit-and-miss, and the legs add only a tiny bit of incline.Size:138cm x 64cm x 12cm (113cm in running mode) (LWH)Weight:24.6kgWalking deck size: 42 x 102cmMaximum user weight:120kgAverage running cost:2p/hourIncline:six degreesMaximum speed:12km/hFolding:yes – safety handle for runningWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenUsing a walking pad for an hour each day should only add about £10 a year to your energy bills.Photograph: Leon Poultney/The GuardianHow much should I spend?Prices vary when it comes to walking pads, with the most affordable costing about £100. Anything less than that is unlikely to last until the end of the month.From my testing, the sweet spot seems to be about £250, where you can get a good blend of value and decent build quality. But some of the best we tested were, predictably, among the most expensive. These high-end models typically cost about £500.How much room do you need?If you’ve got good clearance underneath a bed or sofa, most walking pads will happily slide underneath without the need to fold them up. Imagine a slimmed-down treadmill without the safety handle, and you’re basically there.Models like those from BodyMax fold in half, which drastically reduces the length (or height, depending on how you store it), making it much easier to slide into more compact spaces such as a cupboard or wardrobe. But bear in mind the overall weight – many weigh up to 30kg, so they can be tricky to move without help.How easy is it to maintain a walking pad?Most walking pads come with a small bottle of silicone oil provided. This is used to lubricate the underside of the rubber deck every couple of months to ensure smooth movement. Most manufacturers also supply the required hex key so you can tighten the belt if it’s slipping or has moved slightly off-centre.Quickly check the deck alignment and any moving parts every couple of months, and it should be enough to keep a walking pad running smoothly for years.Do walking pads use a lot of electricity?Walking pads use much less powerful motors than their running treadmill counterparts, and they often do away with power-sapping incline motors and connected Bluetooth features that can see electricity bills spiral.During testing, most walking pads drew between 70 and 100W at a relatively standard 3km/h walking pace. This figure increased slightly as the speed increased.Using a walking pad for an hour each day at those sorts of figures equates to about 2-3p a day – or about £10 a year. Much cheaper than a gym membership, but more costly than getting out in nature.Can I run on a walking pad?Some walking pad speeds are capped at about 6km/h, which makes running on them tricky. A plodding jog is a better description.Some walking pads we tested did reach much higher speeds, but most came with a folding safety handle that extends to allow them to safely reach those speeds, giving the runner something to hang on to should the worst happen. These also came with a separate safety system: a small magnetic tag that attaches to clothing. If this becomes detached, the machine shuts off.It’s worth noting that the general build and robustness of walking pads aren’t up there with their running-focused counterparts, though. That means they can be noisy, shift around underfoot and generally feel a bit flimsy during faster and longer runs.On top of this, those without handles don’t have the automatic shut-off functionality either, which can make them more dangerous, particularly when using them at higher speeds.In summary,running treadmillsare better suited to those wanting to move at higher speeds. They feature more underfoot cushioning or built-in suspension systems, which makes longer, faster sessions more comfortable and easier on the joints.Leon Poultney has been traversing the worlds of consumer technology and automotive for some of the biggest lifestyle websites and magazines for longer than he cares to divulge.

Within minutes of the insect’s appearance in our periphery, a tide of annoyance rises, and with the quick thwap of a swatter or rolled-up magazine, the bug is gone. Time Flies, a perception-warping bug puzzler, reimagines this inevitably short lifespan as an absurd tragedy – by providing the soon-to-perish pest with a bucket list.Over the course of roughly a minute, players freely buzz around minimalist 2D environments in an effort to make those last wishes come true. The fly’s dreams arrive as vague, far-ranging clues such as “make someone laugh”, “find God”, “start a revolution” and “get rich”, and it’s your job to ricochet around the space until you land, often literally, on a clarifying and usually funny realisation. Similar to Coal Supper’s satirical side-scroller,Thank Goodness You’re Here!, Time Flies relies wholly on experimentation and intuition to understand the world around you, rather than explicit quest markers or info dumps.View image in fullscreenLife’s short … Time Flies.Photograph: Playables / PanicThere are four levels in total, including an art-stuffed museum, a flowing sewer and two busy bric-a-brac filled homes. The game’s scratchy monochromatic visual style frames each space, with the seemingly quaint locations hiding a host of philosophical quandaries and innocuous jokes. Buzzing about, you set off all manner of environmental set-pieces, the details of which are delightfully silly: you can make the Mona Lisa smile by landing on her nose, get drunk on spilled wine, or even grow a flower from a waterlogged corpse. Notably, though, not every action leads to a checked box on the bucket list, and for every Rube Goldberg machine or Jenga tower you discover in the game’s open levels, there are plenty of sharp or gooey life-ending hazards to find as well.The central point of friction here is that there are only so many seconds in a day, and you’ll need to not only discover all the bucket list activities in a level, but also chain them together to unlock the next one. Putting together a perfect route is a straightforward but thoroughly engaging challenge, further complicated by the existence of time-shifting clocks that can be tinkered with to add precious seconds to your painfully short lifespan.Perhaps what makes Time Flies’ conceit so convincing is how infuriating it can be to control the fly, and how annoying it is to listen to its incessant buzzing as you endeavour to meet the criteria. Tapping and holding the arrow keys allows you to direct the fly, but during particularly dexterous activities – such as collecting coins while avoiding an incinerating lightbulb or flying through a statue’s intestines to make it fart – the controls feel appropriately unwieldy. Over time, the repetitious process of reincarnation becomes an uncanny mirror, reflecting our own futile desire for order in a world plagued with unpredictable obstacles. Even with our comparatively epic lifespans, many of us will struggle to achieve some of the fly’s loftier ambitions, unless we reorient what those ambitions mean to us – something that Time Flies insists we contemplate.Mocked by the clock and the whizzing sounds in your ears, Time Flies gets under your skin not only because it’s a clever puzzle game, but because it manages to break down its profound ideas into easily digestible nuggets of gameplay. By blending its thinky thesis with such playful mechanics, Time Flies supplies a lighthearted canvas for players to engage with existentialism for an hour or two. As you seek a sense of meaning for the fly by ticking off their ambitions, there’s plenty of room left for you to muse about your own.Time Flies is out now, £11.49Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesPuzzle gamesreviewsShareReuse this content"

It has beenfound in Greenland’s ice cap, near the summit of Mount Everest, and in the deepest depths of the western Pacific Ocean. Nature programmes havesounded the alarmover a human-made crisis that has become an environmental scourge and aserious threat to our health. Yet global production of plastics ison course to tripleto more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060, after increasing by more than 200 times over the past 75 years.This gloomy backdrop should inject a sense of urgency into UN-convened talks in Switzerland this week, aimed at agreeing a binding global plastics treaty. In 2022, when 173 countries committed to work towards such an accord,there was widespread reliefthat at last a multilateral route was to be taken towards solving a quintessentially global problem. Sadly, as delegates gather in Geneva, there are reasons to be fearful.As major oil-producing countries seek to circumvent the consequences of the green transition, the fossil fuel-based manufacture of plastics has become a key battleground. During five rounds of negotiations, over three years, a “petrochemical bloc” led by Russia and Saudi Arabia has stalled and obstructed attempts to agree a reduction in production. And as arecent investigationby the Guardian laid bare, corporate capture of the talks has also become a significant problem. Industry lobbyists have sought to dominate and divert the debate, promoting implausible panaceas in the form of new recycling technologies and other mitigating measures.The return of Donald Trump to the White House is unlikely to improve the prospects of a truly ambitious reset. On the first day of his second term Mr Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, signalling his contempt for multilateralism and his unflinchingbacking for big oil. There are already signs that in Geneva the US plans to align itself with fellow fossil-fuel producers in resisting any attempt to agree to a reduction in virgin plastic production.Given such headwinds, the scale of the crisis bears reiteration. Ahead of this week’s talks,an expert reviewpublished in the Lancet described plastics as “a grave, growing and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health”. Thanks to television series such as Blue Planet II, the grievous impact on blighted marine ecosystems is relatively widely understood. But plastic production also contributesmore than 3%of annual global greenhouse emissions. Most insidiously, its ubiquitous presence in everyday life means that chemical additives and pollutants find their way into human bodies. According to the Lancet report, health-related damages globally add up to £1.1tn a year, with infants and children particularly vulnerable.Carrying on with business as usual, while seeking unlikely technological fixes, will not be good enough. A cap on global production is desperately needed, though achieving that in Geneva looks like a tall order. At last November’s talks in South Korea, more than 100 countries supported legally binding reductions but negotiations collapsed without an agreement.A consensus of sorts may be found on the need to eliminate harmful chemicals from future manufacture, and phasing out single-use plastics, which account forhalf of the 400m tonnesproduced every year. That would at least be a start. After years of obfuscation and delay, something tangible must emerge from Switzerland.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The US is promoting misinformation on SSRIs and pregnancySunny PatelA recent FDA advisory panel discussion contained falsehoods and overstated risks. That’s dangerous for mothers-to-beTue 5 Aug 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 11.57 EDTShareLate last month, the FDA advisory panel – on the heels of the president’s “make America healthy again” executive order scrutinizing psychotropic medications – raised debate around the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in pregnancy. Commonly called antidepressants, these medications are used to treat a range of disorders, and earlier this year a consortium of major mental health organizationspushed backon the administration’s stance.As a perinatal psychiatrist who sees pregnant and postpartum people struggling with conditions such as depression and anxiety every week, I’m deeply concerned that this public discussion – chaired by the controversial FDA commissioner Marty Makary –shared significant misinformationabout mental illness and the treatment modalities (with overly simplified statements denouncing “chemicals” during pregnancy).How can RFK Jr ‘Make America healthy again’? He is ignoring the two biggest killers of American children | Devi SridharRead moreHere in Washington DC, I recently examined a pregnant woman struggling with severe depression and anxiety. As she was nervously mulling treatment options we had discussed, she asked me questions about starting medication to treat her condition: will this affect my child’s development? How long will the medication stay in my child’s bloodstream? How much of the medication will go into my breast milk? Do I have to stay on it for ever?These questions are part of everyday practice for those who care for individuals making decisions about treating their mental health challenges in the course of pregnancy. And answering them clearly is critical for people already dealing with some of the most difficult and vulnerable moments of their lives.But giving established guidance becomes difficult at a time when the authorities themselves are platforming misinformation under the guise of scientific inquiry.There isn’t enough space here to deconstruct all of the falsehoods shared by some of the FDA panelists, with often meandering anecdotes that did not address the core issue being discussed.The panelists overstated risks, which may deter treatment, despite robust data supporting the safety of use of SSRIs when clinically indicated.As the adage attributed to W Edwards Deming goes: “In God we trust; all others, bring data.” Here’s the data: we know that severe maternal mental health challenges occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period. And according to a recentnational study, there have been large declines in mental health among pregnant women – one in five pregnant women struggles with conditions such as anxiety and depression during their pregnancy. Three in four pregnant persons are untreated. That’s more than 500,000 people every year who experience significant mental health issues before, during or after their pregnancies.There are also real harms of untreated perinatal depression and anxiety – such as preterm birth, bonding difficulties, and even maternal death by suicide or overdose. The low, manageable neonatal risks generally support initiating and continuing SSRIs when they’re clinically needed. These women need and deserve evidence-based care.And as for pregnant people who do take SSRIs, large reviews, called meta-analyses, find no overall rise in major birth defects from taking SSRIs during pregnancy, and occasional small links to heart problems with certain drugs disappear in larger studies. Some newborns exposed late in pregnancy may have an issue called neonatal adaptation syndrome – mild, brief withdrawal-like symptoms which include jitteriness, poor feeding and affect the baby’s breathing – but this almost always clears up quickly with routine care in the first week.There is also an inherent problem in the way the FDA panelists spoke about the issue: one that minimized the health of the mother and focused solely on the baby. I am the first person to say there is a dearth of science when it comes to maternal mental healthcare. We need more research, and it is unfair that so many are left scrambling for help outside of our health system. But we should be seriously weighing the risk of not treating these conditions because mental illness is real and has significant impacts on the wellbeing of the pregnant person and baby.Dear America: women’s bodies are not state property | Tayo BeroRead moreSSRIs are not new drugs – they’ve been on the market for more than 30 years, and if there is a widespread epidemic of the harms that the FDA panel claimed, it is not substantiated in the data. So let’s not apply an inconsistent standard towards SSRIs in pregnancy. Their comments that we need more data is the last slide or nearly every scientific discussion – of course, we need more robust data. That shouldn’t seed unnecessary doubt and leave patients and their doctors in a limbo on how best to treat these conditions.We need the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time. In this moment when trust in government institutions is at a low, sowing further doubt is the last thing my patients deserve. The American public needs to know they are getting the highest quality guidance; in the absence of that, lives are at risk.As we’ve seen in the case of vaccines, official federal guidance has been rapidly changing and is often out of alignment with the best science available. Professional medical societies are currently filling the void where government guidance falls short. If this panel on SSRIs is a harbinger of what’s to come, this might become the case for SSRIs in pregnancy. TheAmerican Psychiatric AssociationandAmerican College of Obstetrics and Gynecologyhave expert guidance on treatment, including psychotropic medications.As for my patient, we evaluated the data – doctor and patient – and together she made an informed decision weighing the risks and benefits to start an SSRI along with therapy. Her mood and anxiety improved, and she had a safe delivery. Both mother and baby are thriving.Dr Sunny Patel is a psychiatrist at Georgetown’s Thrive Center for Children, Families, and Communities.

One unit of the labor department is the Bureau of Labor Statistics.I was instructed by my predecessors as well as by the White House, and by every labor economist and statistician I came in contact with, that one of my cardinal responsibilities was to guard the independence of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Otherwise, this crown jewel of knowledge about jobs and the economy would be compromised. If politicized, it would no longer be trusted as a source of information.So what doesDonald Trumpdo? Inone fell swoopon Friday, he essentially destroyed the credibility of the BLS.Trump didn’t like the fact that the BLS revised downward its jobs reports for April and May.With Trump wreaking havoc, a question for the US Democrats: when will you ever learn? | Timothy Garton AshRead moreWell, that’s too bad. Revisions in monthly jobs reports are nothing new. They’re made when the bureau gets more or better information over time, which it often does.Yet with no basis in fact, Trumpchargedthat Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of labor statistics, “rigged” the data “to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad”. Then he ordered her fired and replaced with someone else – presumably someone whose data Trump will approve of.How can anyone in the future trust the information that emerges from the Bureau of Labor Statistics when the person in charge of the agency has to come up with data to Trump’s liking in order to stay in the job? Answer: they cannot.Trump has destroyed the credibility of this extraordinarily important source of information.When Trump doesn’t like the message, he shoots the messenger and replaces the messenger with someone who will come up with messages that he approves. So we’re left without credible sources of information about what is really occurring.Trump is in the process of trying to do the same with the Federal Reserve – demanding that Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chair,cut interest ratesor lose control of the agency.What happens to the Fed’s credibility if Powell gives in to Trump? It loses it.In the future, we wouldn’t have confidence that the Fed is fighting inflation as rigorously as it should. And without that confidence, longer-term interest rates will spike because investors will assume that there’s no inflation cop on the beat, and therefore will demand a higher risk premium.Trump hates facts that he disagrees with. That’s whyhe’sdismemberingthe Environmental Protection Agency, which has repeatedly shown that the climate crisis isn’t a “hoax”, as Trump claims, but more like a national emergency.Now’s the time for Democrats to hammer Trump on the economy | Lloyd GreenRead moreIt’s why Trump isattackingAmerican universities, whose scientists are developing wind and solar energy, and whose historians have revealed America’s tragic history of racism and genocide of indigenous people.He is killing off the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, which are showing the sources of sickness and disease and how we can guard against them.This is a man and a regime that doesn’t want the public to know the truth. He is turning the US into George Orwell’s dystopian 1984.The Trumping of America is happening so fast and in so many places that it’s hard to see the whole. Which partly explains why he doesn’t want the facts out. He doesn’t want us to know how bad it really is.Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

After decades of being told to “Put on more clothes! You’ll catch a cold!” I now, despite knowing better, insist the same for my daughter.“Another layer!” I demand of my partner, who begrudgingly bundles up a toddler already as puffy as the Michelin Man. The scientifically literate part of my brain understands that no jacket will shield her from the onslaught of daycare viruses. And yet I cling to the conviction that underdressing or stepping out the door with wet hair in winter must be avoided at all costs.Are the cries about catching one’s death just old wives’ tales passed down like family heirlooms, or is there a hint of truth in the warnings?Is ‘office air’ to blame for your limp hair and spotty, flaky skin? | AntiviralRead moreOld wives’ tale or hint of truth?“People get more colds when the weather is cold,” says Hassan Vally, an associate professor of epidemiology at Deakin University. “It’s a very natural thing for humans tolook for patterns,” he adds, but points out that correlation is not causation.“You’re not going to catch a cold by just going out in the cold,” says Dr Larisa Labzin of the University of Queensland’s Institute for Molecular Bioscience.To develop cold symptoms, you need to be infected by a virus, whether that be one of the rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus or any other of the more than 200 strains that cause the common cold. Thoughthe flumay present with similar symptoms, influenza viruses can cause much more severe disease.Labzin says the weather does have a substantial impact on the spread of these viruses. “Humidity really drops a lot in the winter – it gets really dry, your skin gets really dry – and that actually helps the viruses.”Moisture in the air hinders the airborne transmission of viruses, which means if “there’s low humidity and someone around you has the flu, it is going to transmit better at a further distance”, Labzin says.Respiratory illnesses peak in winter in temperate regions but Vally points out that the tropics – where temperatures vary less year-round – don’t experience the same seasonal spikes. The rainy season in many tropical areas has been linked to greater activity ofinfluenzaandRSV– which may seem counterintuitive as ambient humidity is higher then.One hypothesisthat may explain both winter epidemics in temperate regions and rainy season outbreaks in the tropics is behavioural: people spend more time indoors to avoid the cold and wet.“Cooler temperatures certainly encourage people to gather indoors which increases transmission,” Prof Nathan Bartlett of the University of Newcastle says. A cold day keeps us inside for about one to two hours more on average, and rainy weather 30 minutes more, according toone estimate.Colder temperatures and immunityThough being cold won’t necessarily result in catching a cold, there is evidence that chillier temperatures affect immunity, Vally says.“Not only is there more opportunity to catch a virus, but our immune response is also a bit diminished,” Labzin agrees.“Cooler, dryer air allows viruses to be transmitted more efficiently and suppresses innate immune defences in thenasal passages– which is where these viruses get in,” Bartlett says.In dry winter weather, the mucus lining our airways – which plays an important role in trapping noxious inhaled substances – becomes thicker, making it more difficult for hair-like cells in the airways to remove trapped particles and pathogens.Less exposure to sunlight – necessary for our skin to produce vitamin D – in the colder months may also have an impact on immunity. “There is evidence that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for increased respiratory infections during winter,” Bartlett says. While asystematic review– the strongest form of scientific evidence – has found vitamin D supplements can help protect against respiratory infections,other findingssuggest that supplementation is “unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect” in Australia, given that severe deficiency is not common here.Cold exposure can also be a physical stressor. “Whenever your body is under stress you can get transient suppression of your immune responses,” Vally says. “If you’re in -20C without a coat, your body is going to be hugely stressed, just like it would be hugely stressed if it ran a marathon.”Paradoxically,somesmallstudies have found the stress of repeated cold water exposure activates the immune system slightly, suggesting the bodies of habitual winter swimmers developadaptive changes.Ultimately, catching a cold results from a “complex interaction between virus, host and environment”, Bartlett says. “All three are in a constant state of flux – and winter coincides with changes in all of these factors.”How to avoid winter lurgies‘We’re losing decades of our life to this illness’: long Covid patients on the fear of being forgottenRead more“For flu, for Covid, there are obviously vaccines available,” Labzin says, noting that an RSV jab is now recommended for immunocompromised groups. “The best protection … is getting vaccinated.”Flu vaccination ratesin Australia, across all age groups, are significantly down from 2020 figures.“It’s important for people to not take antibiotics for a viral infection, because antibiotics won’t do anything,” Labzin says, citing the growing issue ofantimicrobial resistance.Minimising transmission by practising good hygiene, wearing a respirator mask and staying home while sick is familiar to most from the Covid pandemic – and the same advice applies to the common cold.Donna Lu is an assistant news editor at Guardian AustraliaAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Starmer must find the courage to change courseEd DaveyPoll after poll shows most voters think leaving the EU has been a failure. Closer ties with Europe would bring huge rewardsTue 5 Aug 2025 10.46 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 12.50 EDTShareBrexit isn’t working, and the British people know it. Poll after poll, including thatunveiled this weekendby More In Common for the Sunday Times, shows thatpeople are feeling the terrible damagecaused by the deal forced upon us by Boris Johnson, Kemi Badenoch and the rest of the Conservative party, and want something different. The latest shows less than a third of Britons would vote to leave the EU if a referendum were repeated.There’s no doubt that fundamental change is needed. There’s no doubt the public will is there to make it happen. The question is: will Keir Starmer seize the moment and deliver it?There are big prizes on offer if he does. Giving our economy the boost it desperately needs, pulling it out of the cycle of low growth and high debt that the Conservatives plunged us into. Helping to raise more funding to lift our NHS and other public services off their knees. And, crucially, showing people that there is a better, more hopeful way forward than the nasty, nonsensical “solutions” they hear from Nigel Farage and his fellow snake-oil salespeople on the right.Because people are, understandably, fed up. After so many failures of Conservative andLabourgovernments, people’s faith in politics is at an all-time low. Many people just don’t believe that any government of any party can really make their lives better. And beyond our shores, they see a world rife with conflict and instability, making it even harder to envisage our domestic challenges being solved.It’s no surprise that all this disillusionment is fuelling the rise of rightwing populists such as Farage. Restoring faith in politics is critical if we are to save our country from a Reform UK-Conservative coalition of chaos. And acting decisively to fix our broken relationship withEuropeis Starmer’s big chance.To be fair, the prime minister has made some tentative steps in the right direction. He has at least shown a willingness to take a more positive and pragmatic approach to Europe than his Conservative predecessors. He has talked about ayouth mobility schemeand bringing down trade barriers in key sectors such as farming and energy.But so far, all these amount to little more than promises to “work towards” new deals. For all the smiles at the“reset” summitin May, there’s very little in the way of concrete progress to date. Like so much of this government’s record, it risks becoming too much like “continuity Sunak”: all process and promises, no real change. But with growth still flatlining, Donald Trump wreaking havoc on the global economy and populism on the march, this challenge is much too urgent for such timidity.Of course, we know why Starmer has been reluctant to go further. He’s spooked by the combined threat of the Conservatives and Reform, both of whom are itching for the chance to plunge Britain back into the nastyBrexitwars of the past decade. Well, I say let them try. With so many serious problems in need of urgent solutions, the British people have absolutely no appetite for all that division and distraction, and they will have no truck with politicians who do.The way to see off the populist right isn’t to cower in its shadow; it’s to step up and offer a compelling, positive alternative. So what does that look like? The first thing the prime minister should do is raise his sights when it comes to negotiating with the EU. This can’t be about the odd limited improvement for this sector here or that sector there. The government has to be far more ambitious than just trying to polish up the rough edges of Johnson’s bad deal.Just imagine if, instead, the prime minister set a clear target of leading the UK into a new customs union with the EU by 2030. That could be truly transformative. It’s the single biggest thing the government could do to turbocharge our economy in the medium and long term. It would set us firmly on the path back to the single market, with all the benefits that would bring. It would be a game-changer – not just for our economy, but for the future of British politics.And not only that. A clear commitment to work towards a customs union would unlock big benefits for the UK now. It would give us the power to finally sign a veterinary and plant health agreement to boost British farming, and secure that youth mobility scheme to give our young people incredible new opportunities to live, work and travel across Europe, while also helping British employers to recruit the workers they need.Or even something less headline-grabbing but potentially just as impactful, such as joining theEuropean UnionAviation Safety Agency. Post-Brexit rules mean that air cargo firms – such as the one run by a constituent of mine – can’t have repair work done in Europe, apart from by the single German workshop that is recognised by the UK. It means they have to fly their planes all the way to the US just to get them serviced – at huge expense.With a more ambitious approach to Europe, we could get rid of that ridiculous red tape, and so much more like it. We could free British businesses to get on with their work, create jobs and grow our economy. That is the real change people across the country are crying out for. The opportunity is there and the rewards are great. I really hope the prime minister is listening.Ed Davey is the leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for Kingston and SurbitonExplore more on these topicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionForeign policyEuropeKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s time democracies woke up to the true nature of his regimeRémy Amahirwa is the oldest son of Victoire Ingabire UmuhozaTue 5 Aug 2025 06.54 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 06.57 EDTShareWhen I see the “Visit Rwanda” logo stitched on to the jerseys of famous football clubs like Arsenal or printed in glossy travel magazines, I feel a rush of pride for the natural beauty and warm hospitality of the country of my birth. Yet, I wonder whether the tourists being courted truly understand the darker side ofRwanda. This side has torn my family apart for nearly two decades; it is the reason my mother sits behind bars, once again, as a political prisoner.My mother, Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, is a political activist who first returned to Rwanda from exile in 2010. Our family had a stable and comfortable life in the Netherlands for many years, but my mother could not stop thinking about her native Rwanda and was deeply troubled by the events unfolding there. The president,Paul Kagame, heralded as the man who stopped the 1994 genocide, was quietly becoming yet another strongman on the African continent. My mother could not silently watch from the sidelines in Europe as Rwanda’s citizens lost their freedoms and suffered persecution.She eventually returned to Rwanda seeking to challenge Kagame and run for the presidency, but these plans were quickly thwarted. Shortly after her return in 2010, she was arrested and forced to face charges of genocide ideology and terrorism in a trial that wasinternationally condemnedas unfair and a violation of her rights. She was sentenced to15 years in prison.My mother was in jail for eight years, much of that time in solitary confinement. When she received a presidential pardon in 2018 from President Kagame himself, we thought our family would finally have a chance to reunite. But even though she was no longer imprisoned, my mother was not free. She was prevented from running for elected office. To this day,her political party has not been allowed to officially register. The conditions of her pardon also required her to seek permission if she wanted to travel outside Rwanda, but despite her numerous requests, permission has never been granted.My mother has missed every important moment and milestone in our family’s life since her return to Rwanda, from graduations, to weddings, to the birth of her grandchildren. She has not even been allowed to visit her husband, my father, who has faced severe health challenges that have left him paralysed and gravely ill.Paul Kagame banned opponents like me from Rwanda’s election. No wonder he cruised to victory | Victoire Ingabire UmuhozaRead moreThe conditions of my mother’s pardon were set to expire in October of this year. We hoped and believed that this would mean she would have her freedoms and rights fully restored. When I visited her in Rwanda earlier this year – our first reunion in 15 years and the first time she has ever met my wife and children – we dared to plan to celebrate Christmas together. These hopes were dashed when she wasarrested on 19 June 2025. She now faces vague and politically motivated charges, including conspiracy to overthrow the government and spreading false information. She is awaiting what will certainly be a political trial, like the one she went through in 2010.Still, in many ways my mother is fortunate. She is alive. The same cannot be said for members of Dalfa Umurinzi, the political party she established. Since 2016, several members have gone missing, andothers have been murdered. Their political activism ultimately cost them the highest price, and our mother has often told us this terrible injustice motivates her to keep going in her fight for democracy and respect for human rights.The first time the Rwandan government imprisoned my mother, I was only a child, too young and scared to advocate for the mother I love and admire so deeply. But times have changed, and now I will use my voice whenever and however I can to draw attention to her unjust imprisonment and call for her freedom.View image in fullscreenVictoire Ingabire walks outside the Nyarugenge prison after being released on 15 September 2018.Photograph: Cyril Ndegeya/AFP/Getty ImagesI ask democratic leaders and governments around the world to hold Rwanda accountable for violating the standards of international law. Since Kagame became its leader, Rwanda has styled itself as a commendable success story in Africa and a worthy player in the international community. There are too few who question whyKagame wins elections by 99%of the vote while arrests, disappearances and even killings of his critics occur both within and outside Rwanda’s borders. We need more governments to raise these questions and demand answers.The country still depends heavily on overseas development assistance, so I join with those who argue that such aid should require Rwanda to ensure true democracy, liberty for all and justice according to the established rule of law.My mother, Victoire, and many other courageous dissidents in Rwanda have risked their lives to speak out for these values. Now I ask the international community to speak out for them. Rwanda needs a consensus democracy, one that solves political problems through dialogue, to move toward a better future for all. But this is impossible as long as an authoritarian regime maintains control. Hope for the freedom of dissidents like my mother, and for all citizens of Rwanda, rests in diplomatic intervention, political pressure and the media’s role in uncovering the true nature of the regime in Rwanda.Rémy Amahirwa is the oldest son of the Rwandan dissident Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza.

The government has signalled its support for colossal expansions, whose extra flights would bust its carbon pledges. The excuse is that supertechnology will magic away the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere, though it must know that clean, green flying is still futurology. Here’s the pity of it: until now this government has rightly boasted of its green credentials, making massive investments in sustainable energy and retro-insulating cold homes. Expanding air travel is not on any green agenda.Heathrow has just submitted proposals fora £50bn third runway, as approved by Labour in 2009 and the Tories whovoted it through parliament in 2018. Covid applied the brakes but now Heathrow is back with gold-plated, “shovel-ready” plans. Its owners, including Qatar, Singapore and Saudi Arabia, expect the planning bill to prevent newts or judicial reviews blocking the runway. Their pitch to an investment-hungry government is that expanding Europe’s busiest airport would create 100,000 new jobs, propelling growth with 750 extra daily flights.Flying gets a green light from the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander: she agreed todouble the sizeof Luton airport, favoursGatwick’s second runwayfor 100,000 more flights and gives Stansted’s expansion a fair wind. These allowa 70% increasein flights above 2018 levels, andcancel out all the carbon savingsfrom the government’s clean power plan.Rachel Reeves promised to be “Britain’s first green chancellor”, but her plans live or die on growth, so billions in private investment is hard to resist. But beyond construction, the growth-potential claims for extra flights look highly dubious. The promised global “connectivity” imagines business people zipping into Britain with briefcases full of contracts. But that’s not who these extra flyers will be. Most will be frequent flyers flying more frequently, not for business but for leisure, according to theNew Economics Foundationand Possible, the climate campaign. National Travel and Civil Aviation Authority passenger surveys show only one in 14 UK passengers are business travellers. The pandemic showed that meeting online saves money and time; business travel has already peaked. Would extra flights bring in tourist income? No, 70% of flights are British tourists off abroad to spend vastly more than foreigners spend here.Of extra flights in 20 years, 83% were taken by already frequent flyers, mostly for leisure. Growth will not be from more families taking an annual holiday: half the population doesn’t fly in any year, while just 15% consume 70% of flights. Nearly a third are “ultra-frequent flyers” taking six or more journeys a year. Instead of these heaviest users paying more for their pollution, airlines reward frequent flyers. The Flying Fair report from the New Economics Foundation suggests imposing a high levy on those flying six or more times a year, not added to ticket prices but raised in tax returns. That makes the cost of their excessive air travel highly visible, and could raise £6bn a year, while cutting aviation CO2 by 28%.View image in fullscreenPassengers wait for train services at Euston station as Storm Floris disrupts travel across the UK, 4 August 2025.Newly nationalised trains would gain from disincentivising flight. But UK prices are a bizarre deterrent. I’m planning to go to Edinburgh next week – a train journey I love. Checking prices, I found a £29.99 flight each way, while LNER costs £181.69 return. France has banned domestic flights where trains can do the journey in less than two and a half hours and so should we: start by banning airlines charging less than rail. Switch the39m domestic journeysbeing made annually by plane to train.The good news is theextra potential capacityin the Channel tunnel, which could be realised with a little investment. Twelve trains an hour run each way, but the tunnel could run 2.5 times more, and prices would fall. That’s where investment should go, instead of to airports, as new European routes open up. Yes, it takes longer. It means adding train time to the concept of a holiday. But if it were cheaper, what luxury it would be compared with the hell of holiday airports and flights that don’t land you in city centres.Climate damage is the real cost of avoidable flying.The chancellor says: “Expansion must be delivered in line with UK’s legal, environmental and climate obligations.” But the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the government’s statutory adviser, warns that airport expansionwould breach UK carbon budgetsfor net zero emissions by 2050. The aviation industry and government claim that wonder technology will deliver carbon-free flying with electric planes, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) and carbon capture. None is anywhere near available, says the CCC, which expects 17% SAFs by 2040. It advises no extra flying before 2030, and only 2% more by 2035, to allow time for new technology to be developed. Let’s hope clean flight arrives soon, but it’s not here yet: currently, suppliers must only guarantee that SAFs comprises 2% of the total. Here’s the honesty test for those claiming carbon-neutral flight is imminent: agree to no extra flying until it arrives.What will expanding Heathrow do to UK’s net zero plans?Read moreThe government’s mood music is all pro-flying, not urging climate-conscious travel. To change habits and attitudes, it should start by banning frequent flyer bonuses. Why allow private jets?

It’s a tale of very capitalist timesTue 5 Aug 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 03.51 EDTShareBonnie Blue has sex with men on camera for money. Lots of men one after the other, to be precise, for lots and lots of money: the commercial niche she invented to distinguish herself from countless other amateur porn stars jostling desperately for attention on OnlyFans was inviting “barely legal” ordinary teenage boys (which in porn means 18-plus) to have sex with her on film, and flogging the results to paying subscribers for a fortune. Unusually, her model involves a woman making millions out of men generating content for free, which makes it slightly harder than usual to work out exactly who is exploiting whom if she turns up (as she did in Nottingham) at a university freshers’ week with a sign saying “bonk me and let me film it”.But debating whether getting rich this way makes Bonnie personally “empowered” seems tired and pointless. It was with this old pseudo-feminist chestnut that Channel 4 justified last week’sratings-chasing documentaryon her attempt to sleep with 1,000 men in 12 hours, a film that finally brought her into the cultural mainstream. There’s more to this story than sex, gender politics or Bonnie herself, and whatever is driving her (which she swears isn’t past trauma, “daddy issues” over a biological father she never knew, or anything else you’re thinking: though she does say maybe her brain works differently from other people’s, given her curious ability to switch off her emotions). It’s at heart a story about money, the merging of the oldest trade in the world with a newer attention economy inexorably geared towards rewarding extremes, and what that does to the society that unwittingly produced it.As her now-estranged husband explained admiringly to camera, though OnlyFans performers often invite a man to imagine he’s doing whatever he wants to them, that’s an illusion: really they’re out of reach. But Bonnie (real name Tia Billinger) isn’t. She actively encourages her fans to come and do it to her for real. She is the parasocial relationship – that strange confusion created when you think you know someone because you’ve seen so much of their life unfold on your phone screen, though in reality they’re a stranger – taken to its fantasy conclusion: a stalker’s dream made flesh. Like what you see? Then just reach through the screen and grab it.Bonnie/Tia comes across essentially as a female Andrew Tate, telling teenage or otherwise vulnerable audiences that they have a right to sex – in one video urging men not to feel guilty about taking part in her stunts, she says it’s only what they were “owed”, the language of the incel forum – and that it’s hot to beslapped around or degraded; but, unlike Tate, with the apparent authority of actually being a woman herself. Channel 4 filmed the men queueing up to join her 1,000-men stunt mostly as a line of mute, anonymous shuffling feet. But we already know that watching near-ubiquitous porn online has changed the way younger generations have sex. What does being invited into the picture do? No wonder Ofcom is taking an interest, while the children’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, warns against TV normalising things that – as she put it–teenagers find “frightening, confusing and damaging to their relationships”.Ironically, the biggest short-term beneficiary of such a storm may be Bonnie/Tia herself, already a dab hand at posting rage-bait videos expertly calibrated to provoke women who already can’t stand her (and are willing to explain why at length to their own followers on their own social media channels). Being hated is great for business, she explains chirpily: the more women publicly denounce her, the more their sons and husbands will Google her. Her real skill is in monetising both lustandrage, crossing the internet’s two most powerful streams to capture its most lucrative currency: attention.“She’s a marketing genius,” her female publicist tellsChannel 4, laughing as the team discuss how best to commercially exploit footage of an appalled mother trying to retrieve her son from one of Bonnie/Tia’s filmed orgies. OnlyFans performers can’t advertise as a normal business would, so they promote themselves by seeding clips across social media, ideally of them doing something wild enough to go viral: since people get bored easily, the pressure is always on to keep getting wilder and wilder, pushing way past whatever you thought were your limits.That has long been the trajectory of porn stars’ careers, of course. But it’s also recognisably now true of so much contemporary culture, from fully clothed influencers to reality TV shows forced to introduce ever more cruel plot twists to stop the formula getting stale (this year’s Love Island has noticeably morphed from dating show into a kind of brutal sexual Hunger Games), and arguably even broadcasters such as Channel 4 fighting desperately for audience share in a world of almost infinite competition for eyeballs. When I finish watching 1000 Men and Me: The Bonnie Blue Story on catchup, the channel’s algorithm perkily suggests an episode ofSex Actually with Alice Levine. Like the sexy stuff? Want more? Please don’t leave me for YouTube!Parents, don’t panic – healthy screen time for children is possible, if you follow these few simple tips | Kaitlyn RegehrRead moreAs with Tate, if Bonnie was somehow shut down there would be another one along soon enough. She’s a feature, not a bug, the inevitable product of an economy relentlessly geared to giving an audience what it most reliably pays for – to feel angry or horny, or both at once – and then endlessly pushing its luck. But society does still have some limits to impose on what is in the end just another business model.Her current nemesis is Visa, which processes OnlyFans payments and which she says declined to be associated with her 1,000-man marathon, leading to her being banned from uploading it and cashing in. (Legislators have long regarded mainstream financial services companies on whom porn sites rely to rake in their profits as the crack in their armour, more susceptible to public opinion and regulatory pressure.) Meanwhile, a newtaskforce on pornographyheaded by the Tory peer Gabby Bertin, who formerly worked for David Cameron in Downing Street, is arguing for a ban on content likely to encourage child sexual abuse – which Bertin argues could encompass “barely legal” material or (as Bonnie has alsoexperimented with doing, as her options narrowed) casting grown porn actors as schoolgirls.Like Labour’s battle against Page 3 girls in the 1990s, which in retrospect seems an astonishingly innocent era, if ministers want to pick this fight with porn it will be brutal. But doing nothing might, in the end, be more so.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Without one, liberals will just be an interval between populist actsTue 5 Aug 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 11.15 EDTShareKarolina WiguraJarosław KuiszWe were travelling across Poland by train the day after the country’s sensational parliamentary elections in autumn 2023. When news of the results came through, passengers in our compartment fell into each other’s arms, rejoicing as though a great weight had been lifted from their shoulders. Hard as it was to believe after eight years, the national populists of the Law and Justice party had beenousted from poweron a record turnout of 75% of voters. We felt the potential of democracy to change things for the better as a physical sensation.Less than two years have passed but this enthusiasm has disappeared without trace. The Law and Justice-backed candidate Karol Nawrocki won thepresidential election run offin June with 50.89% of the vote, securing theadmiration of Donald Trumpin the process. Days before Nawrocki’s swearing in on Wednesday [6 August] a new poll suggested that almosthalf of voterswould like the prime minister, Donald Tusk out. The ruling coalition is wobbling. Tusk’s liberal democratic government may turn out to be nothing more than an intermezzo, a pause between rightwing populist governments.After more than a decade of living, in a global sense, with the new wave of populism, we can see a pattern of missed opportunities of which Poland is just one example. In countries ruled bynew populists, voters often come to feel disappointment and anger. In recent years, liberal candidates, carried by a tide of opposition, have ousted the populists: before Tusk managed it in Poland there was Joe Biden in the US,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silvain Brazil andZuzana Čaputováin Slovakia. The victories of these politicians seemed briefly like beacons of hope for the post-cold war liberal democratic consensus.But rebuilding after populists vacate office can resemble a daily struggle in the political mud. A victorious election campaign is not the same as a definitive victory. The war against populists is a permanent one, and a global one, amplified by digital media.Post-populist rule is all the more difficult because populist governments leave behind a legal minefield. InPoland, countless legal decisions and acts in force were intended to undermine liberal democratic institutions. Dismantling them constitutionally and restoring the rule of law takes time and energy. It also requireslooking back to the past rather than focusing on the future as the new government addresses its predecessors’ mistakes. In Poland and Brazil, this has stifled any ambitions to offer an exciting roadmap for the years ahead. Inevitably, any initial euphoria is quickly followed by public frustration and the rise of another challenge from the rightwing populists.Since the anti-communistSolidarity movementin the 1980s, Poland has been a crucial laboratory in the battle for democracy. After returning to power in 2023, Tusk faced a dilemma: should he completely distance himself from his predecessors’ agenda or flirt with their legacy? Tusk chose the second option. He maintained the populists’ programme of direct financial support for families with children. He continued with the construction of a mega transport hub, a flagship project for the previous government that he had previouslyattacked as wasteful. It is especially striking that he has failed to liberalisePoland’s abortion laws, which were tightened by the populists. Echoing the nationalists’ rhetoric about migration and defence of national borders has led to Poland reimposing checks at itsborders with EU neighbours Germany and Lithuania, despite all three countries being in the Schengen area.Letting the national populists set the political tone for him is driving Tusk’s failure. The defeat of his presidential candidate, Rafał Trzaskowski was followed by a collapse of support in the polls. The absence of an inspiring vision, or even a sense of what Tusk stands for, is painful to witness.If parliamentary elections were held today, Poland’s rightwing populists would be emphatically returned to power, probably with an even more radical nationalist programme. Abroad, Tusk may be admired as a staunch defender of democracy. At home, he has become one of the most unpopular politicians in the country.Call it the Gorbachev syndrome: beloved internationally, but reviled domestically. Tusk’s ratings slump can be blamed on a whole set of unfulfilled promises, poor messaging and a poor presidential campaign. He is also affected by the global tendency to reject establishment politicians. To many Polish voters, especially younger ones, Tusk, who has been active in Polish politics for more than 25 years and was prime minister from 2007 to 2014, seems like part of a tired old elite whose time has come to step aside.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here, Tusk and Lula disappoint, just as Čaputová and Biden did before them. The message is lacking, but the medium is challenging too. So far, rightwing populists are winning on the battleground ofnew and social media.It is not the only example, but the Polish case clearly demonstrates the folly of fighting elections purely on the defensive. It is too little and too narrow. Liberal ambitions must extend further than preventing populists from coming to power or removing them from it.Elections have to be understood as a chance to rebuild democracy, and to do so in tune with the new media environment. Without a forward-thinking approach, the liberal intermezzo will remain just that: a brief interval between acts in a longer populist play. Democrats must learn this lesson – contending with populism means not only confronting the past, but also offering a compelling vision for the future.Karolina Wigura isa Polish historian and co-author ofPost-Traumatic Sovereignty: An Essay (Why the Eastern European Mentality is Different).

And it should be said that as an essay in alternative existences and parallel realities, this film and Curtis’s starring role are far more interesting than the bafflingly overrated Oscar-winner Everything Everywhere All at Once.The preceding film, from 2003, had Curtis and Lohan as a quarrelling mother and daughter who swap bodies due to the hilarious magical otherness of Chinese fortune cookies. (In 2025, the new version is a bit culturally lairy of gags like that.) It is based on Mary Rodgers’s 1972 novel, first filmed in 1976 with Jodie Foster as the daughter, a formidably precocious young star who was in those days considered to be already body-swapped into fierce adulthood. The publicity for this film promises legacy cameos and when one teen character talks about her French boyfriend, many FF fans will have been excitably wondering if this French boyfriend has a French-speaking mom played by a certain French-speaking star?In this new contemporary reality, written by Jordan Weiss and directed by Nisha Ganatra, Curtis’s character Tess Coleman is a grandma, therapist and parenting podcaster, and her once-tearaway daughter, Lohan’s character Anna, is a music producer and single mom to a Gen-Z teen; this is Harper, played by Julia Butters, a young actor still legendary for her scene opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Tarantino’sOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.‘Generations of women have been disfigured’: Jamie Lee Curtis lets rip on plastic surgery, power, and Hollywood’s age problemRead moreWhen Harper has a big fight in school with her obnoxious, princess-y British lab partner, Lily (played by non-Briton Sophia Hammons), she is horrified when Anna falls hard for Lily’s hot single dad Eric (Manny Jacinto); these enemies are both appalled at the prospect of becoming stepsisters. This situation becomes even more complicated – freakier in fact – when a zany palm reader and fortune teller triggers a new cosmic body-swap nightmare, this time involving four women, not two.Another version of this movie might have wanted to dip its toe into the issues of body image and identity: Freakier Friday keeps it light, partly as a result of Curtis’s jokey grandma, in whose knockabout generational presence there is no question of anything tricky. Curtis gets the laughs with her puppyishly uninhibited performance and there are some great gags, including one at the expense of oldsters who use a certain social media platform. There are also some amusing contributions from SNL trouper Vanessa Bayer as the fortune teller, comedian X Mayo as the school’s dyspeptic principal and Santina Muha as a US official who has to assess the authenticity of Anna and Eric’s marriage.As for Lohan, she does a reasonable job, although her own body-swapped status as the legendary wild-child of old who is now playing a stressed middle-aged person has to remain unemphasised, simply because Lohan doesn’t really have the comedy chops. It’s Curtis who embodies the story’s wacky spirit.Freakier Friday is out on 7 August in Australia and 8 August in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmComedy filmsJamie Lee CurtisLindsay LohanComedyFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But years later, when she went back over all the photographs she’d taken during that period, things looked rather different. “I’ve got tons of photos of airport lounges and long stretches of road in Europe,” she says with a shake of the head. “Lots of German service stations. Nothing of the band! No backstage fun, no frolics!”Jackson may regret not capturing more of the band’sshort but spectacular heyday, but the road has always been important to her. As a Pulp-obsessed teenager in Bury St Edmunds, she would gaze out of the kitchen window and dream of escaping small town life via the A14. The Long Blondes track Separated By Motorways told the story of two girls doing a runner down that exact road (“​​Wipe your eyes darling, it’s OK / Meet me on the dual carriageway”). And over the last decade or so, roads have become a central feature of her second career in visual art.Nobody really takes any notice of them – you're always whizzing byUsing bold, pop art-inspired colours and sharp geometrical lines, Jackson’s paintings transform parts of our unloved motorway network into dazzling scenes of romance and possibility.

Nobody really takes any notice of them. You’re always whizzing by. But there’s always a moment when the light catches them in a particular way and makes them seem incredibly beautiful.”This month, Jackson has been selected to pick the theme forDRAW!, a nationwide drawing project backed by David Hockney that is part of Bradford 2025 UK City of Culture. She has chosen “landscape”, andwill be on social mediaencouraging people of all ages to pick up a pen or pencil or iPad and sketch something fitting. The project’s aim is to get people to pause and reflect on their surroundings, and it’s already having an impact – on Jackson herself.“It’s funny,” she says. “You spend years trying to develop your own style, to make your work recognisable. But then you get stuck in that style. You stop experimenting and you stop being playful. And art is all about experimentation and being playful. So this has made me go back to my sketchbooks and try different things.”Jackson is actually creating a new body of work as we speak, saying she’s “completely changed everything” as a result of DRAW! “I’m using a celestial astrological wheel, drawing the symbols that represent the star signs and bringing some animals in.”Giddy Stratospheres, a 2004 single by Jackson’s former band the Long Blondes.She has drawn and painted since she was young, sketching boats on the harbour with her “very talented” artist mother. She would have completed a fine art degree in Sheffield had the Long Blondes not taken off during her final year – even then, she carried on making art for their record sleeves. In fact, she thinks a painting of Diana Dors made in her student bedroom may have helped the band crystalise their aesthetic: a mixture of retro glamour, film and literary references, and spiky guitars.With her neck scarf and beret, Jackson added some much-needed style and intellect to the era’s male-dominated indie scene. The band earned a devoted fanbase and wrote one of the defining anthems of the 2000s: the disco-punk singleGiddy Stratospheres. But after two albums, guitarist and songwriter Dorian Cox had a stroke and was left unable to play the guitar. The band called it a day.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But that record’s painful gestation convinced her to redirect her attention towards painting. She spent four years refining her style in Rome, and has developed an eye for brutalist landmarks as well as all the motorways and bridges. More recently, though, she has caught the music bug again. During lockdown, and with her then two-year-old son asleep next to her, she found herself messing around with Logic on her iPad and began pushing herself to compose electronic music. Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware was impressed with the results and offered to produce them, and a Terry Farley remix of her track Don’t Doubt Your Power (recorded under the name Corselette) will hit clubs later this year.‘It’s all just very grimy and filthy’: Gregory Nolan’s photos of the 00s indie sceneRead moreIt took a while before Jackson could look back fondly on the Long Blondes’ time in the spotlight. “We didn’t make Kaiser Chiefs money,” she says with a wry smile. “But I think [debut album]Someone to Drive You Homestill stands the test of time.” And despite the lack of photographic evidence, Jackson knows she had a lot of fun too. “Oh definitely,” she says. “In terms of getting to be in a band, that whole period was really the last hurrah.”DRAW! a Landscape with Kate Jackson atbradford2025.co.ukExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtIndieUK city of cultureBradfordRoad transportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She is Dorothy Blawna-Gale and she is a pantomime dame. The creation of Johnny McKnight – Scotland’s finest proponent of the form – she is sharp-tongued, lascivious and bumptiously lovable.Unlike her usual festive appearances at the Tron in Glasgow and the Macrobert in Stirling, she is here, out of season, not just to entertain – which she does in abundance – but to educate. In a show that grew out ofa lecture at the University of Glasgowin memory of the late academic Alasdair Cameron, a champion of popular theatre, McKnight and director John Tiffany throw in songs, sweets and copious audience interaction to celebrate panto’s radical potential.It is very funny, but the real soul of this tremendous show lies in the personal story McKnight tells. From his earliest memory of seeingJohnny Beattieat the Ayr Gaiety, when he realised “You don’t just see panto; panto sees you,” he takes us through his first tentative steps as an actor playing the comic silly billy role, hiding behind the character’s asexual charm, and then, in 2006, his first dame.But something was wrong: in sticking so rigidly to tradition, the tired assumptions, the dated jokes, he was repressing his true self and muting the anarchic possibilities of the form.It was time to kill the old. In the coming seasons, he upended the cliches, corrected the gender balance and acknowledged his own sexuality. By 2018, he was fielding two male romantic leads inMammy Gooseand audiences did not just accept it: they demanded more. Along the way, he faced sectarianism, homophobia and serious ethical questions, but sticking to the principles of always punching up, thinking his choices through and representing the marginalised, he reclaimed panto’s subversive spirit and made it, hilariously, his own. Oh yes he did.At theTraverse, Edinburgh, until 24 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviews.Explore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025Traverse theatrePanto seasonTheatreEdinburgh festivalComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)reviewsShareReuse this content"

No, you don’t,” saidStephen Colberton Monday’s Late Show. “Because things cannot be known any more. What you thought you knew is just history.” Especially history, as the Smithsonian removed Trump from the impeachment exhibit in the American history museum.“Oh, now you care about what’s in the American history museum!” Colbert joked to loud boos from the crowd. “Where was that enthusiasm when dad worked so hard to plan the family trip to DC?”The museum reportedly removed a label noting both of Trump’s impeachments – for bribing Ukraine, and for his role in the January 6 riots – after pressure from a White House content review. “That kind of pressure explains why the Smithsonian exhibit of the 1960s now says that the Vietnam war was started by Jimmy Kimmel,” Colbert joked.Seth Meyers on the Epstein conspiracy: ‘This is a crisis of Trump’s making’Read moreThe exhibit now says that “only three presidents have seriously faced removal”, instead of four. “Come on! If you’re going to completely make up presidential history, make it fun,” said Colbert.A new report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics also confirmed that Trump has overseen the worst period of US job growth since the pandemic. So naturally, Trump responded by firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “No, you fool! Now there’s one less job,” Colbert joked. “But it makes sense – he fires anyone who gives him bad news.”“Here’s the problem with this: having people in the government who know stuff is pretty important,” Colbert added. “If Trump starts fudging the job numbers it could backfire, by eroding the trust of investors, companies and organizations.”In other Trump news, the White House unveiled plans for a new $200m ballroom, with gold chandeliers and floor-to-ceiling windows. “Presidents are allowed to do a little renovation, of course. The Obamas added a vegetable garden. Truman and Nixon both added bowling lanes, and Jimmy Carter famously added a sex dungeon,” Colbert joked.But Trump has already paved over the historic rose garden with concrete, to make room for more seating. “It reminds me of the poem,” Colbert laughed. “Roses are red. Concrete is white. This place looks like shit now.”Seth MeyersAnd on Late Night,Seth Meyersreacted to a report that aradioactive wasp nestwas found at a site in South Carolina that once made nuclear bomb material. The nest reportedly had nuclear contamination levels 10 times higher than what is allowed by regulations. “I guess my bug spray is going to continue to not work,” Meyers joked.“I have so many questions,” he continued. “What do you mean 10 times higher than what’s allowed? I wasn’t aware there was a certain level of radiation that’s allowed for wasps. Is there like a sweet spot level that is low enough not to kill us all but high enough that if a kid on a field trip gets bitten he might turn into a superhero?”“If I’ve spent too much time on this wasp story, it’s because the rest of the news is shit and I’m stalling,” he added, moving to the next worse story: a product recall of High Noon vodka sodas mislabeled as Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz energy drinks.“If you can’t trust Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz, who can you trust?” Meyers quipped. “Because, you know, I care about what I put in my body. So when I throw back a Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz, I want to know it has the stuff I care about. Like blue, and razz. Celsius Astro Vibe Sparkling Blue Razz might be what made the wasps radioactive?”“I think we should embrace this combo moving forward, because the two things I need living in these trying times are energy and to be a little bit drunk.”Meyers also touched on the news that Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after his report found that US jobs growth had basically ground to a halt. “Trump doesn’t know how to solve a problem. He only knows how to cover it up,” Meyers said. “And that’s the hallmark of a corrupt autocracy. When the numbers are bad, just fire the people in charge of the numbers. If you’re caught up in a scandal, dangle a pardon to get out of it.”But “the problem is it’s backfiring”, he concluded. “These stories won’t go away. That’s why Trump always looks like a guy who’s been stung by a thousand radioactive wasps.”Explore more on these topicsLate-night TV roundupStephen ColbertSeth MeyersTV comedyComedyTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He quit the grog. And apparently gave up the women. But Day reveals a PM beset by familial turmoil while presenting a newly curated public persona. This is a must if you read the compelling first volume.– Paul DaleyThe Last Days of Zane Grey by Vicki HastrichNonfiction, Allen & Unwin, $34.99View image in fullscreenShark. Camera. Action! Decades before the fin‑flashing brilliance of Jaws, pulp novelistZane Grey sailed into Australiachasing a great white for his ill‑fated 1936 film White Death. In The Last Days of Zane Grey, the acclaimed nature writer Vicki Hastrich charts the arc of that quest – the role Australia played in Grey’s restless final chapter, and the unlikely mark he left on the national imagination.This swashbuckling tale has it all: encrypted letters, love quadrangles, high‑society hi-jinks, very big fish, cinematic fiascos and a man in a duel with death itself. Proof that sometimes the wildest thing in the water is the human ego.– Beejay SilcoxThe Visitor by Rebecca StarfordFiction, Allen & Unwin, $32.99View image in fullscreenRebecca Starford is rapidly becoming one of our most gripping writers: first there was Bad Behaviour, her memoir of bullying at an elite country boarding school, then her second world war thriller The Imitator, about a female MI5 spy tasked with infiltrating a Nazi ring in London.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningHer third book, The Visitor, is quieter but just as riveting: Laura, an Australian living in the UK, returns home to Brisbane to sell her parents’ house after they mysteriously die in the outback. That mystery is part of the appeal but its gothic quality, its spooky sense of the uncanny, are what sets The Visitor apart – and the ending is a cracker. –Sian CainMy Father Bryce by Adam CourtenayBiography, Hachette, $32.99View image in fullscreenThe late Bryce Courtenay was a mainstay in Australian publishing: every 18 months or so he would release a new novel and dads everywhere would reliably buy his latest doorstopper about brave young men navigating wartime or the winds of history, making him one of the country’s bestselling authors.But the version of his life that he shared with the public was largely untrue, according to his son Adam, who reveals that his father was a fabulist who lied about being an orphan, that he escaped orphanages by winning a prestigious scholarship, that his lawyer father had fought apartheid in South Africa and that he himself had to flee the country due to his activism. This is a truly revelatory biography, unflinching and unsentimental, which shows how Bryce became a man who wouldn’t let truth ruin a good story. –SCLearned Behaviours by Zeynab GemieldienFiction, Ultimo, $34.99View image in fullscreenZaid is a prospective barrister who has broken through the glass ceiling, as a Muslim man from western Sydney. He’s well-travelled, owns a luxury car, and attends swanky soirees with wealthy colleagues. But when he is pulled into a murky murder committed by his now-dead best friend, he’s forced to reckon with his choices and the way they have shaped his life.Zeynab Gamieldien’s second novel is a subtle social commentary about belonging and social mobility. Compelling and pacy, it demonstrates an acute awareness of experiences of privilege and subordination, without being preachy. –Sarah AyoubHailstones Fell Without Rain by Natalia Figueroa BarrosoFiction, UQP, $34.99skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As her bonds with her daughter, Rita, and her Aunt Chula stretch, fray, and threaten to snap, she grasps for connections that might still be mended.Moving between Uruguay and western Sydney, this bold and compassionate novel celebrates matrilineal connection and cultural inheritance with humour and tenderness. –Seren Heyman-GriffithsThe Leap by Paul DaleyFiction, Summit Books, $34.99View image in fullscreenThere’s a crime, but it’s not a crime novel as such; the pace is thrilling, but it’s not a thriller … as such. Paul Daley’s fine literary sensibilities foreground hisgenre-defying third novel about a stranger in a strange land. Ben Fotheringham-Gaskill, a British diplomat who has had his fair share of traumatic postings, believes his move to Canberra with his family will be a late-career cruise. But when his boss sends him to the outback town The Leap, things take a dangerous turn as he wrestles with a dilemma involving the possible murder of one of the town’s favourite daughters.With echoes of theKenneth Cook classic Wake in Fright, Daley renders the picaresque with precision and humour, steadily building mood and menace as Australia’s bloody black/white history comes into play.– Lucy ClarkPlaying Nice Was Getting Me Nowhere by Alex CothrenShort stories, Pink Shorts Press, $32.99View image in fullscreenAlex Cothren teaches creative writing at Flinders University, with a research focus on satire – and his debut collection of short stories is so assured, bleak and uncannily prescient that they could have been written tomorrow. In one, a headhunter for an Australian football league drafts refugees at offshore processing camps to play brutally – often murderously (“six points for knocking a bloke unconscious” – for the ultimate prize: citizenship). In another, which I read in June as mass protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement were making headlines in the US, undocumented migrants in a single file are forced into a small construction trailer, which flashes in an “instant e-deportation”, disappearing them for ever.But the one that’s stuck with me for the longest is, happily, the funniest. It’s called Where’s a Good Place for an Adult to Hide? I won’t tell you anything more about it. –Steph HarmonGone Bush: Easy Campfire Recipes by Outback Tom and Steve ForrestCookbook, Pantera Press, $36.99View image in fullscreenThe internet’s favourite grandson-grandfather duo have arrived in paperback form to share their tasty and easy-to-follow collection of bush-style recipes. Good food is simple food (most of the time), says Outback Tom, a Yorta Yorta man who grew up in the east Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is there we learn how to cook Australian staples including damper, spring rolls and loaded snags.Outback Tom and Grandad also share tips on the logistics of cooking in the bush. Learn how to make a bush stove and what native ingredients to keep an eye out for, courtesy of the duo’s wealth of experience living off the land. Make sure this is in your bag on your next adventure. –Isabella LeeBomb Season in Jakarta by Grant DooleyNonfiction, Simon & Schuster, $36.99View image in fullscreenGrant Dooley and his wife, Kristan, had a ringside seat to a tumultuous time in Australia’s most populous neighbour, Indonesia. Both were stationed in Jakarta as diplomats during a period of frequent terrorist activity, including the 2004 bombing of the Australian embassy, which killed 11 people and injured 200; the Dooleys were in the building at the time.Dooley’s workmanlike memoir of this early 2000s period reads as a journal of the daily life and career ambitions of a bureaucrat abroad. It is an insightful glimpse into the thoughts and experiences of the Australians who represent the rest of us to the world. –Celina RibeiroConspiracy Nation by Ariel Bogle and Cam WilsonNonfiction, Ultimo, $36.99View image in fullscreenGuardian Australia’s Ariel Bogle and Crikey’s Cam Wilson have spent years reporting on the follies and foibles of the internet. In that time both have witnessed first-hand the increasingly siloed – and increasingly dangerous – tenor of online life.“We’ve watched closely as once-fringe ideas and the language of conspiracy have become part of [the] Australian public,” the pair write in the introduction to their new book: a series of investigations into the rhizomatic subcultures and panics buried just beneath the nation’s psyche, from Port Arthur “truthers” to Pete Evans.– Michael SunExplore more on these topicsAustralian booksBookmark thisFictionHistory booksCrime fictionBiography booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s nuanced, subtly political, poignant TV – and there’s never been a better time for its focus on tolerancePhil HarrisonTue 5 Aug 2025 10.24 EDTLast modified on Tue 5 Aug 2025 10.25 EDTShareIt’s been 15 years since we last enjoyed the company of Hank and Peggy Hill. Barack Obama had just entered the White House, Hank was a younger man with an exciting adventure ahead of him and all was, if not quite well with the world, certainly at least explicable. But now? Season 14 of this revived, beloved animated sitcom is upon us, feeling anachronistic yet also oddly timely. It’s like reconnecting with a group of old friends and realising that, while they are much as they always were, the context in which you now see them has altered beyond all recognition.Playing slightly against cartoon convention, the Hills’ lives have moved on. Unlike, for example, the ageless Simpsons, everyone is visibly older. In the intervening years, the propane industry has taken Hank and Peggy to Saudi Arabia. As we rejoin them, they are on the plane home. Hank has been in the toilet for hours because, as Peggy sees fit to inform the other passengers, “he now has the urethra of a seven-year-old”. When they touch down in Texas, Hank kisses the ground. But will he recognise the place?As they drive around their neighbourhood, Hank has a realisation. Their gated community in Saudi Arabia was “more Texan than Texas”. The US has exported an idealised version of its past especially for the ex-pats, even as the country itself has transformed beyond all recognition. King of the Hill always did subtle political messaging, wrapping pointed observations in the gentleness of the comedy.Hank is quickly back on familiar territory, standing by the fence outside his home, sharing a beer with his old pals. Bill has let himself go, badly. Boomhauer is still mumbly, but now has a similarly mumbly child. He greets Hank with a slightly surprising hug. As a man who still expresses his love for his son by offering to check the oil in his car, Hank finds this awkward. But as ever, the writing brings a remarkable amount of nuance to these simply but carefully constructed characters. Even in retirement, Hank is working through a few things.Dale, though, is a different keg of beer altogether. He hasn’t learned anything; instead the world has come around to him. Back in the day, Dale’s fondness for conspiracy theories made him the butt of the jokes. He doesn’t seem like such a harmless eccentric any more, though. Needless to say, he references “the pandumbic”. Hank, though, is old school and old media; he had access only to Fox News and CNN while in Saudi Arabia – although he feels he has to apologise for having watched CNN.Hank is a Republican – during the show’s original run, his response to learning that he was driving through Bill Clinton’s home town was to lock his car doors. But this adds real poignancy to the new iteration of the show. Much has changed in the US and not everything to Hank’s satisfaction, with one of those things being public discourse.At one point, Hank, Peggy and Dale go on a museum tour themed around George W Bush during which they are offered the chance to role-play a cabinet meeting. However, it degenerates into wild fiction as participants start ranting about “Obama’s Kenyan handler”. Dale is no longer an outlier – he’s now a thought-leader. Mike Judge’s and Greg Daniels’s writing perspective is evident here: Hank longs for an old, moderate America that couldn’t always agree, but could at least accept shared terms of reference within which they could argue.There is, however, a kindness to King of the Hill, which finds equal expression alongside the show’s occasional disquiet. There is charm and progress in its apparently changeless setting. The Hills’ son, Bobby, was once a chubby, geeky misfit. Happily, he has been given an upgrade that feels at once generous, eccentric and earned. He is a chef at a Japanese restaurant and Hank’s and Bobby’s familial battles are now fought via the proxies of food and drink. Hank and Bobby enter a brewing contest. “It’s just a friendly contest between father and son,” says Hank. “Where the father will kick his son’s ass.” Father and son receive a necessary lesson in humility.There remains a lightness and ease to these exchanges. Fittingly, as is the case with most longstanding relationships, the old rhythms return almost immediately, for the Hills and for viewers. Often, King of the Hill drifts toward the neat and the saccharin. It’s not a show that will ever hold back on the hugging and learning. But that feels entirely deliberate; at the moment, a show prioritising modesty, tolerance and gentle revelation feels more welcome than ever.King of the Hill is on Disney+Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewAnimation on TVTV comedyComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

That’s right: worse than A Thousand Words, the Liar Liar ripoff so underwhelming that Murphy had to take a break from making comedies. And worse than Norbit, the Nutty Professor ersatz probably costing him the Oscar for Dreamgirls. At least in those comedy clunkers, Murphy came to play. He made clear either through advanced prosthetics or through sheer force of personality that he could deliver a satisfying performance no matter the premise – or, better still: elevate hackneyed material. But in this straight-to-Prime Video snoozefest Murphy struggles to hide his age and boredom while looking for all the world like a hostage in his own heist flick.The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing spoof rebootRead moreIt takes work to make Murphy entirely unfunny, and this film manages the job one-handed. It surrounds him with a playful cast: Eva Longoria, a true all-rounder; Pete Davidson, the SNL stitch-up; and Keke Palmer, maybethe funniest woman of her generation. But then it delivers them a script written by two guys – Kevin Burrows and Matt Mider – best known for a web series about anthropomorphic lobsters. It all comes together in 90 of the longest minutes you’ll ever spend in front of a screen, provided you even make it that far.At this late career stage, Murphy is at his best when leaning into nostalgia – whether replaying the hits (Coming 2 America, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F) or indulging his inner child (Dolemite Is My Name, Candy Cane Lane). But The Pickup doesn’t even get that right. Instead it has Murphy playing Russell, an armored messenger counting down the days until retirement in a set-up seemingly ripped from the first Lethal Weapon.Then there’s Davidson as Travis, the doofus partner who nearly shot up a bank after misreading a random come-on as a robbery attempt. And while his instincts weren’t completely off – his seducer, Zoe (Palmer), winds up stripping him of privileged security information – they do ultimately leave him and Russell vulnerable to a hijacking while making rounds in their armored truck. Naturally, that sets up phase 2 of the plan – an overwrought copy-paste of Oceans 11. At one point Zoe chalks up her heist plans as just another big score in our otherwise compromised capitalist system. But that line isn’t as eye-roll inducing as the implication of romantic chemistry between Zoe and Travis, which the film is at pains to hammer home with a nod to Davidson’srumored BDE.To watch Murphy throw drop-kicks, launch dye packs and otherwise fend off robbers is to be reminded of Murphy’s increasing reluctance to perform his own stunts at age 64. During the press run for Axel F, he joked about rebuffing director Mark Molloy’s call to run down a set of stepswith greater urgency. “Don’t call me unless you’re offering me the same type of shit you would offer Morgan Freeman,” he cracked.In fact, the film’s action sequences overall beggar belief. Longoria pops up in the middle of the action like Taraji P Henson at the end of Acrimony. Russell ejects one of Zoe’s henchmen from his speeding armored truck on to another car trailing just behind; he crashes back-first on to the hood, caroms on to the highway and somehow lives to fight another day. Worse, bullets fly all over the place – and yet the only one that really lands winds up taking out the chop shop owner played by Marshawn Lynch, a football legend with a pronounced history ofrepelling unwelcome aggression.Oh, and they had the nerve to name Lynch’s character Chop Shop without nodding at that absurdity. They didn’t give him any funny lines or make much effort to punch up the truck depot manager portrayed by Andrew Dice Clay – you know, the comedy legend who played to a sold-out Madison Square Garden crowd not long after Murphy set the standard. The waste of comedic talent here borders on criminal, but not as severe as commissioning Ruth Carter to render the pedestrian costumes. All of it will leave you wondering if director Tim Story, the same comedy boffin who gave the world Barbershop, Ride Along andThe Blackening– had this picture hijacked out from under him. Or maybe he was just keen to show how many cars he could blow up in one frame?Early on in the film, as the buddy cops settle into the getting-to-know-you stage, Russell shares his gauzy plan to open a bed and breakfast upon retiring, and Travis balks at the career shift. Technically, he tells Russell: “Your generation can’t pivot,” but it feels like he’s speaking directly to Murphy – who should’ve known better than to pick up a full-on action comedy script at his big age. This film isn’t likely to do significant long-term damage to his beloved reputation, not with his turn as Inspector Clouseaucoming down the pike. But those who do brave his heist flick won’t soon forget the time they were taken prisoner, too.The Pickup is out onAmazon Prime Videoon 6 AugustExplore more on these topicsComedy filmsEddie MurphyComedyAction and adventure filmsAmazon Prime VideoreviewsShareReuse this content"

It was a brilliant creative job where I worked with primary school kids who were struggling with home and school life. We had one little boy, aged seven, who was a world of chaos, he found it hard to connect with others and he had a tough exterior on show nearly all the time. However, a couple of times a week, we had story time in the library, a quiet and tiny room, and he would always, without fail, come and sit as close to me as he could, and ask very quietly for “Bogalabol” – Burglar Bill. He would then listen with rapture and delight to the whole story, and join in with his favourite phrases. As he listened, he became a little boy again, taking pleasure in this story with its salt of the earth burglars, and the simple joy of being read to. It remains one of my favourite memories of that time. Of course I read Burglar Bill to my own kids, and I expect I’ll read it to any grandchildren I have!Tanya Logan, 53, Frome, Somerset‘I used to do my best Ray Winstone growl when reading’I loved Burglar Bill. He steals such bonkers stuff, and then he finds – a baby! And eventually true love with Burglar Betty. I used to read it to my kids doing Burglar Bill in my best Ray Winstone growl. They loved it. The books were a great way to introduce my own kids to reading, and later many others when I worked as an English teacher.Esther Pocock, librarian, SwedenThe Happy Families books‘I still use the letter he wrote to me to this day’I’m a primary school teacher and about 12 years ago I wrote to Allan Ahlberg with my class. He took care to write a really individual letter back to us, addressing every child’s comments (and mine), and he also shared some early drafts of Mrs Wobble the Waitress and some copies of a couple of his new books at the time (Hooray for Bread was one of them). I was really impressed by his generous spirit in replying in such detail, and I still use the letter with classes to this day to say: “Look, real authors need to re-draft, so you should too!”Luke Stratton, 41, primary school teacher, Coalville, LeicestershireEach Peach Pear Plum‘On a whim, I texted my 28-year-old daughter the first line and she replied with the next one – and so it went on for 10 minutes’All of them are favourites – but particularly Each Peach Pear Plum and The Jolly Postman books. On a whim I texted the first line of the former to my 28-year-old daughter the other day. She immediately texted back (while at work I may add) the following line from the book, and so it went on for 10 glorious minutes between us both, word perfect with no cheating, smiling away at our phones. Me – charmed at the way this book has resonated through the years between mother and daughter. She – thrilled with a young child’s delight in being clever in remembering it all in the middle of her busy day. It is still the book I buy for all new parents I come across, as I will do for hers as and when she has children of her own.Jayne Stead, retired teacher, York‘My two girls love it’The wonder of the Ahlbergs’ books span generations and they are so detailed, clever and don’t talk down to children. [Allan’s wife Janet Ahlberg illustrated all his books until her death in 1994.] They are among the few authors I enjoy reading night after night; I received Each Peach Pear Plum from a friend with older children, who wistfully said she could still happily recite it from memory. My two girls love the book.Caroline Haywood, 39, lawyer, Nairobi, KenyaPeepo!‘My child who was non-verbal until three could still communicate by finding items in the pictures’With my own child, who was non-verbal until three, books with things to look for such as Peepo! meant they could still communicate by finding items in the pictures. The repetitive nature also meant things could be mimed or signed. Then when speech came the rhymes were fun and they were reading without noticing! Allan Ahlberg’s books enriched my teaching and the lives of children I know. Isn’t that a special legacy?Kathie, former teacher now works in data protection, St HelensCops and Robbers‘No one could compete with the Ahlbergs’There are so many to choose from but I’d have to opt for Cops and Robbers as it went from mild peril to slapstick comedy and had everything in between. I loved them when I was a kid and when my daughter was little I read her every Janet and Allan Ahlberg book I could get my hands on. We read a lot of books together but no one could compete with the Ahlbergs. They are the greatest children’s authors of all time, bar none.Martin Hall, 46, librarian, Frankfurt, GermanyThe Baby’s Catalogue‘It helped me as a new parent’The Baby’s Catalogue was introduced to me by an unemployed mother while waiting in a Berkeley unemployment line 40 years ago. Two children later, while waiting in a pediatrician’s office I discovered a ratty copy of Burglar Bill on the book pile. The story was so enchanting that I am ashamed to say I nicked it. The Baby Catalogue helped me as a new parent understand that the smallest, mundane parts of a child’s day could be beautiful and important to them so to accept it with patience and grace. As for Burglar Bill, my boys didn’t turn to a life of crime like their mother. In my defence I’ve taken good care of the book.Kathy Nilsson, 67, retired, Mountain View, CaliforniaFunny Bones‘To open his books is to feel a jolt of warmth and home again’I had all but forgotten about Ahlberg’s books until I started working as a children’s bookseller. To discover them again, to turn the pages 20 years on from the last time, made me ache for a time and a place long gone. That feeling never leaves me. Peepo! and Each Peach Pear Plum both sit on my son’s bookshelves and even though I see the spines every single day, to open them is to feel that jolt of warmth and home again. They are perfection. Funny Bones has now become one of my son’s favourite books.

They split over Trump. But few schisms can have been more severe than that of playwright Gabriel Jason Dean and his brother. It is a relationship that inspired this probing two-hander in which a bookish student at the start of a literary career (Blake Stadnik) visits his incarcerated sibling (Matt Monaco), hoping to help with his legal claim for release. As their meetings unfold over years and then decades, one becomes a celebrated champion of liberal values, while the other emerges as a white supremacist.What hope for reconciliation when each brother has views antithetical to the other’s? It is a theme that was explored by Chris Thorpe inConfirmation(2014), which described the playwright’s real-life attempt to see eye to eye with a Holocaust denier. That play was needling and unsettling in a way this one is not, but what Rift has on its side is the fraternal bond at its heart.With head shaved and swastika tattoo showing beneath his orange jumpsuit, Monaco frightens you with the ferocity of his stare and his air of volatility. In contrast, Stadnik could hardly look prissier with his neat business suit and ethical reading list. Yet these men are not strangers and cannot entirely discount each other. Their childhood history, in particular their repressed memories of abuse, gives them a bond that transcends matters of political difference.Directed with verve and intensity by Ari Laura Kreith for Luna Stage and Richard Jordan Productions, the play is at its most affecting when it reveals the vulnerable boys behind the damaged adults. If there is hope for a polarised culture, this is where it lies. There is humanity and understanding here – joining a far-right brotherhood may be a rational choice if your life depends on it – but Rift lets the audience off lightly by skirting the most awkward questions.At theTraverse, Edinburgh, until 24 August.All ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalTraverse theatreUS prisonsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Tom has travelled miles for the funeral of his boyfriend who has died much too young. Deep in the countryside, Ágatha, the bereaved mother, has never heard of Tom and knows nothing of her son’s sexuality. Tom wants to grieve but, out of respect, cannot give voice to his true emotions – not least because the dead man’s brutish brother, Francis, is determined to keep Ágatha in untroubled ignorance.The social awkwardness is part of Michel Marc Bouchard’s play, first seen in Montreal in 2011 and lateradapted for the screen. What director Rodrigo Portella adds to this spellbinding production for Cena Brasil Internacional is a fierce physical awkwardness.It is in the way the actors stand isolated on the desolate stage, designed by Aurora dos Campos in rusty browns that seem to extend for ever. The figures are picked out in lonely relief by Tomás Ribas’s punishing lightning, lost souls on a collision course. It is in the way the stage is puddled with farmyard mud, clinging to the actors and making their discomfort palpable.View image in fullscreenThe death of hope … Tom at the Farm.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianAnd it is in the menace of Francis (Iano Salomão), an unreconstructed symbol of macho intolerance. He bears down mercilessly on the urbane Tom, played with grace and some resistance by Armando Babaioff who, as translator, relocates the script to Bolsonaro’s Brazil, the country reported to have the world’shighest rate of violent deathsof LGBTQ+ people.Coupled with the stately pace of a broody, intense production, it makes this farm not just a reactionary backwater, but a cultural dead end. It is a place where any possibility of progress is extinguished like the sickly cattle Francis throws into a ditch. The play becomes not just about the death of a son but about the death of hope.Even if Ágatha (Denise Del Vecchio) is not as clueless as Francis makes out and even if Tom becomes paralysed by Stockholm syndrome, this awful scenario can surely not persist. Arriving from the city, Sara (Camila Nhary) throws brief light on a self-destructive culture eating itself from within. It is as cruel as it is mesmerising.At thePleasance at EICC, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreEdinburgh festivalLGBTQ+ rightsreviewsShareReuse this content"

It now takes centre stage, as he develops his performance style far beyond clowning to address the plight of his compatriots in the Middle East. Its title, Peace de Resistance, implies a rallying call, but he delivers something different: a compelling collage of historical storytelling, jokes about colonialism, and a silent-comedy style that remains defiantly goofy in the face of abomination.The main strand puts theGazaemergency into its historical context, telling the story of an exiled Palestinian Lothario who falls in love with an Algerian freedom fighter in the 1960s. The brief romance acts like a siren call to Merguez to acknowledge his own people’s oppression and displacement. But – like Wardeh himself, perhaps – he feels sickened and helpless in the face of that enormity, and loth to abandon his carefree life.The Horse of Jenin review – a funny, haunting coming-of-age tale of boyhood in occupied PalestineRead moreSpliced with this tale, we get our part-Irish host, in character as aDave Allen-alike raconteur, telling “an Englishman, an Irishman and a Palestinian” gags that expose the cynicism of British imperialism; and a hand-puppet dumbshow about two fluttering birds torn between loving and consuming one another, which you might – if you squint – interpret as an allegory of Israel-Palestine. Among several archival clips probing the psychological experience of dispossession, Wardeh samples Churchill, arguing for resistance to oppression as not warlike but as “the sole guarantee of peace”.Add to this personal and family memories (his first visit to al-Aqsa mosque, say) recalled by our host himself, stepping out from behind the disguises, and you have a show with lots going on, and lots of emotional significance, implied if seldom directly stated. It feels like the show of an artist still fathoming whether and how (his) art can encompass the Palestinian people’s predicament. The clowning can feel like a relic from Bedu – but also like an appropriately absurdist response to a political situation that is itself beyond sense. It’s an impressive attempt – and no mean achievement – to wrestle something terrible into the shape of a comedy show.AtPleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 AugustAll ourEdinburgh festival reviewsExplore more on these topicsEdinburgh festival 2025TheatreClownsGazaEdinburgh festivalComedy (Culture)Comedy (Stage)reviewsShareReuse this content"

He had been receiving cancer treatment in recent months.Reid never had a hit on the UK charts, but albums such as1973’s Riverremain critically acclaimed, and he was held in such high esteem that he was courted by Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple to be those bands’ lead singer, but turned each of them down. Aretha Franklin stated in 1968: “There are only three things happening in England: the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Terry Reid.”Hendrix, Jagger, Bowie and me: Terry Reid, the British pop outlier adored by the greatsRead moreBorn and raised in Cambridgeshire, Reid was a singer, guitarist and songwriter from his early teens, initially with local group the Redbeats. After supporting Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers, Reid was asked to join the latter band. By 16, he was supporting the Rolling Stones on tour along with Ike & Tina Turner and the Yardbirds, and after breaking away as a solo artist (and befriending Jimi Hendrix), Reid supported the Stones again around the US.Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page admired Reid and asked if he would join a new band he was forming, but Reid turned him down, citing his commitment to the Stones’ US tour. He recommended Robert Plant, singer in Band of Joy, along with that band’s drummer John Bonham: both men joined Page and formed Led Zeppelin. “I was intent on doing my own thing,”Reid told the Guardian in 2024. “I contributed half the band – that’s enough on my part!”He also turned down Ritchie Blackmore’s offer to be Deep Purple’s lead singer after Rod Evans’s departure in 1969, but acknowledged: “It was very flattering. Ritchie was one hell of a guitar player.” Ian Gillan would become Deep Purple’s vocalist instead.Reid signed a management and recording deal with svengaliMickie Most, who oversaw his first two studio albums. His debut Bang Bang, You’re Terry Reid contained a song he wrote when he was 14 years old, Without Expression, which would end up being covered by John Mellencamp, REO Speedwagon and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. There were other high-profile tour support slots, with Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Jethro Tull and more. But Reid’s albums were not commercial successes, and Reid, not seeing eye to eye creatively with Most, eventually split from him.View image in fullscreenTerry Reid in 1973.Photograph: Alan Messer/ShutterstockAfter some years in limbo thanks to a contractual dispute with Most, Reid returned to recording with 1973’s River, the first of three albums that decade, and moved to California. But he put his solo career on hold in the 1980s, focusing instead on session work with artists including Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley and Jackson Browne.A comeback in 1991 with the Trevor Horn-produced album The Driver was not commercially or creatively successful, and though his cover of the Spencer Davis Group’s Gimme Some Lovin’ appeared on the soundtrack to Tom Cruise movie Days of Thunder, Reid later pronounced The Driver “unlistenable”.Reid’s earlier albums became favourites of crate diggers and musos, and he was sought out by artists including DJ Shadow and Alabama 3 for guest appearances in his later years. Jack White’s band the Raconteurs, Marianne Faithfull and Chris Cornell were among the artists who covered his songs. He told the Guardian of unreleased sessions made with Dr Dre, who “became fascinated with [Reid’s album] Seed of Memory and invited me into his studio where we reworked it alongside his rappers, a fascinating experience”.He also continued to tour, but had to cancel a recent run of live dates amid his cancer treatment. Acrowdfunding appealwas set up to cover his medical expenses, which read: “Terry’s spirit remains strong, and he’s deeply grateful for the outpouring of care he’s already received.”Reid is survived by his wife, Annette. Tributes have been paid by musicians includingJoe Bonamassa, who said Reid was “one of the greatest to ever do it and a beautiful person and soul”.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

I texted him already, saying, ‘I hear the reviews are great, and it’s tracking well.’ He was very happy to hear from me, and we’ll probably get together later in the month when the smoke clears.”He continued: “I’m excited about it because it just shows that there’s a strong market for comedy in movie theatres, and spoof in particular.”Last year, the director was less enthusiastic, saying of the reboot: “Paramount is just going ahead and doing it, they haven’t involved me. They’re just gonna do what they want, that’s Hollywood.” Zucker and the franchise’s other co-creators, including his brother Jerry Zucker, had previously pitched a fourth-instalment script focusing on the thirtysomething son of the main character Frank Drebin, but it was rejected by the studio.“We were not excited about having the franchise given to other people,” he continued. “They have not contacted me to make a cameo or be involved in the writing. Whether or not they’re going to do a good job with it, this kind of spoof, I mean it’s not rocket science, but it’s not easy.”Earlier this year,Zucker reiterated his disapproval, saying he was “not planning on seeing the Naked Gun remake”.View image in fullscreenLeslie Nielsen in Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear.Photograph: Paramount/Sportsphoto/Allstar“I regret having seen the trailer for it,” he continued, before comparing the promo to a 2007 Brazilian pornographic film. “It’s like watching 2 Girls 1 Cup. I can’t unsee it.”Despite his turnaround, Zucker reiterated his aversion to seeing the film to Hollywood Reporter, but said that the team behind it had reached out to him before its release.“I’m not gonna see it, but I don’t see any of the sequels that were of my material done by other people, and that’s fine. I’ve told Akiva that I have no intention to see it,” he said.“He actually invited me to come see an early cut of it, but I told him there’s nothing I could do to help because it really isn’t what I would have done. That’s not to say that he didn’t actually end up doing a good movie. But I don’t think I could help with that.”Zucker added that producer Seth MacFarlane had phoned him shortly after the new script had been completed.“He spent the first 10 minutes telling me how much he loved Airplane!, The Naked Gun and Top Secret!,” said Zucker. “I can’t get mad at anyone who will tell me what a genius I am. That was a good conversation.

Democracy and free speech are in freefall. Inequality is soaring, with the 1% scooping up ever-larger shares of global wealth. These days, the US has aGinicoefficient – the most common international measurement of inequality – on a par with slave-owning Ancient Rome. Maternal mortality rates for American millennials are three times higher than those of their parents’ generation – and this in the world’s richest society.Global life expectancy is falling. So, too, are food standards. Outside a few bourgeois sourdough enclaves, real bread has vanished. In its place we get mass-produced, spongy, tasteless “pseudo-bread” – as Guy Debord lamented inThe Encyclopedia of Nuisances. In an earlier age, there would have been bread riots. Now? Just muted indigestion.What accounts for our complacency? False consciousness, claims McDonald in this sparky polemic against the myth of progress. We have been hoodwinked by elite propaganda. The “progress narratives” of the ruling classes assure us that history only moves forward, that we should trust the system and surrender agency to our betters. Even when protests have erupted, they have mostly sought modest tweaks rather than revolution. But progress, argues McDonald, is a false prophet. History hasn’t followed a tidy upward arc. Moreover, what counts as progress has often produced huge collateral damage, including ecological devastation.There was a time when human beings had a “commensalistic” relationship with nature, turning on veneration rather than exploitation. Embracing egalitarianism, most primitive societies didn’t have hierarchies of class or gender. Then, around 3000BCE, the “parasitic” economy emerged. Mesopotamians were the first to behave as though nature was no longer to be communed with but subdued. Religion took the place of animism, preaching dominion over the Earth. For McDonald theEpic of Gilgameshis the first piece of progress propaganda: in it, the eponymous hero kills the forest guardian, tames the wild, and builds a city, filling it with bread and beer to the unbridled joy of his acolytes.The Book of Genesis follows suit. God commands Adam and Eve to “subdue” the Earth and tame every living thing. Later, Christianity – by then a far cry from Jesus’s radicalism – proved useful to Constantine, who saw in monotheism a handy formula: one god, one empire, one emperor. Fast-forward a millennium, and capitalism picks up the baton. Progress, now secularised, means capital formation: wealth siphoned from the masses to the enlightened few, who return to us the bric-a-brac of modernity – antibiotics and air fryers and suchlike. The logic of extraction remains unchanged; nature and proletariat alike suffer.‘I’m certainly open to criticism’: David Wengrow and the trouble with rewriting human historyRead moreMcDonald’s book is a satisfying corrective to the smugness of thinkers such asSteven Pinker, who insist that conditions only ever improve. Yet he oversells his case with sweeping judgments. His account of religion, for instance, amounts to little more than a crude reprise of Marx: it’s all opium for the masses, a tool to pacify resentment. But that’s far too simple. From the Peasants’ Revolt to the Taiping Rebellion, Christianity has supplied radicals with a script for inverting power structures.Equally damaging is McDonald’s uncritical endorsement ofDavid Graeber and David Wengrow’s vigorously contested claim that Enlightenment ideas came from Indigenous America –specifically fromthe Wendat diplomat Kondiaronk – a theory historians such as David A Bell have dismissed as fantasy. On the latter’s account, the French nobleman Baron de Lahontan wasn’t so much lifting his ideas from Kondiaronk as putting his own progressive views into the mouth of a naïf – a common literary device in the early modern period.Readers may find all the doom-mongering a bit much. Indeed, there’s a whiff of the swivel-eyed prophet about McDonald. And like all doomsayers, he is sure that the end-times are nigh. “Climate change and ecological collapse,” we are told, “are very likely to cause political fragmentation that nullifies legal and cultural precedents like [slavery] abolition … If market economies continue, there is little reason to assume they will not return to trade in indentured human beings.” Very likely? The confidence is grating and ignores the simple fact that we no longer live in a labour-intensive economy. If anything, AI is making the return of slavery less, not more, likely. McDonald’s dismissal of the possibility of mass investment in nuclear energy in a “neoliberal” world has already aged poorly, with enormous sums being poured into small modular reactors this year. All of which goes to show that the predictions business is a tough one: things can just as easily go the other way.Progress: A History of Humanity’s Worst Idea by Samuel Miller McDonald is published by HarperCollins (£22).

She is perhaps destined to be known chiefly as the first deaf performer to win an Oscar, for the movie Children of a Lesser God in 1987, but she also campaigned to ensure that Washington DC’s Gallaudet University for deaf and hearing-impaired people hada deaf president, and that all new TV sets were built with optional closed-captioning for deaf people. Generally, she has conducted an ongoing campaign to do away with the condescension of pity, and to raise awareness among hearing people about deaf people’s consciousness and culture, particularly in sign language.Matlin revealedsomething more in her 2009 autobiography I’ll Scream Later: a history of drug addiction (the Betty Ford clinic told her she had to pay for her own interpreter) and of being sexually abused as a child. She also revealed she’d been abused as an adult by her partner William Hurt, her method-acting co-star in Children of a Lesser God, who was perhaps less than delighted to see all the acclaim go to her and was, in a pre-#MeToo period of exposure, singularly unrepentant. There are some toe-curling TV clips of Matlin being patronised by pundits as the “sympathy vote” candidate ahead of the 1987 Oscars, and Stern also perhaps mischievously catches out some people in the present day: Nicole Kidman didn’t look entirely relaxed applauding in sign language as the drama Coda, about a hearing girl in a deaf family, won at the 2022 Oscars.This is an engaging and thoroughly worthwhile movie. I myself am agnostic, to say the least, aboutthe crowd-pleasing Coda, of which Matlin was a part, but it certainly could not have existed without her and her achievements. Children of a Lesser God is a more self-conscious issue movie, though, perhaps oddly, this documentary doesn’t point out its fundamental flaw: Matlin’s character is not subtitled, so Hurt’s character cumbersomely has to vocalise what she signs for the hearing audience’s benefit, as if pondering it to himself. This film makes a rather interesting case that Matlin’s achievements showed up as much or more on TV, with her sparkling small roles on Seinfeld and The West Wing. Either way, Matlin is an American pioneer.Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore is in UK and Australian cinemas from 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsDeafness and hearing lossOscarsWilliam HurtTelevisionAwards and prizesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Their faces are obscure, their bodies intriguing under their shapeless work clothes. What age are they? How are they related? The man is quite young, his top shirt button loose, although his legs are as stiff as a doll’s, inside thick, rough-cut trousers. It’s harder to tell the woman’s age because she stands in profile, a breeze pressing her heavy skirt against her legs, as she clasps her hands. They might be a married couple or, as this painting’s unlikely fan Salvador Dalí claimed, mother and son. Their physicality is intense. The phallic prongs of a thick wooden potato fork and wheelbarrow shafts add to the feeling that, now the working day is done and they’re saying their prayers, they can finally get to bed. But if they’re mother and son? I refer you to Dr Dalí.View image in fullscreenHello Dalí … detail from The Angelus by Millet Jean-François.Photograph: Jean-François Millet/© Musée d’Orsay, Dist. Grand Palais Rmn / Patrice SchmidtI think there’s a reasonMillet makes The Angelus not so much a religious as an erotic landscape. It was the climax of his love affair with the French peasantry. Millet made it his life’s work to portray the rural poor – a class that had been denied full humanity. He depicts lives of backbreaking toil but wants you to see that, behind the hoe, is a human being with a mind, a body, desires.View image in fullscreenStark existential moments … The sower  by Jean-François Millet.Photograph: © Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum WalesLandscape artists often can’t draw the human figure for toffee: that means you, Constable and Turner. But Millet foregrounds the body in stark existential moments of sweaty action. Work that in reality must have been repetitive and mindless becomes full of heroic drama. In The Winnower, a man throws grains in the air in a golden mist to separate the wheat from the chaff. Painted at the time of the 1848 revolutions, when liberal and socialist risings were shaking the wheat from the chaff across Europe, the winnower is, you realise, wearing a reddish-pink bandana, a white shirt and has a blue handkerchief – the colours of the tricolour flag that the first French Revolution invented.Millet’s a revolutionary and his people have plenty to rebel against. In The Sower, a man is sowing seeds in a deep gully: it looks as if he has descended into hell. This pit looks completely barren yet here he is, sowing seeds anyway, the symbolism as hard to ignore as the arses of the two cows that loom against the stormy sky above him. His act may be that of a political campaigner, sowing seeds of change, yet it’s also an image of artistic creativity. The character could be Millet himself, creating something beautiful out of the brutal realities of rural toil.His autobiography is compacted into this small show. Millet was a country boy from Normandy. His painting The Well at Gruchy captures the world he grew up in – a woman fills pots of water from a stone-roofed well that appears to be centuries old. Life is slow there, in Gruchy, and history a massive, immobile presence. The Faggot Gatherers, which Millet was working on up to 1875, looks like a riposte to the impressionists’ emphasis on modernity and middle-class pleasures on boulevards and in cafes. Women lug bundles of sticks through Stygian winter gloom in a scene that could just as easily have been in the 1370s as the 1870s.View image in fullscreenSilent passions … The Goose Girl at Gruchy by Jean-François Millet.Photograph: © Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum WalesHe found one fan looking desperately for soul in the world. Vincent van Goghwanted to emulate Milletas a peasant painter. You see their deep connection in Millet’s drawing A Man Ploughing and Another Sowing. As the broken-looking sower stumbles in the foreground and a ploughman hunches behind him, a flock of black crows rise into the sky – like the birds Van Gogh would see over the wheatfield near the end of his life.Yet for all his brooding compassion, you can’t miss Millet’s turbulent sexuality. The two athletic men in his painting The Wood Sawyers look as if they are cutting up a giant penis. Then again, the slices of trunk also resemble freshly butchered meat – another one for Dalí. More conventionally sexualised are Millet’s portraits of shepherdesses and milkmaids. His painting The Goose Girl at Gruchy may be as much a memory of adolescent longings as a painting from life. Van Gogh in a frenzied letter claims Millet’s women are as sexy as Zola’s – you can see how he got to this and how much Millet’s fascination with the silent passions of country people has in common with Thomas Hardy’s novels.It all comes together in The Angelus, which you keep coming back to after scanning his other works. The scene it immortalises is ancient, the lives these people lived largely lost to history. Millet freezes them like statues. They grow like grass from the hard earth that can’t wait to take them back.Millet: Life on the Land is atthe National Gallery, London, from 7 August to 19 OctoberExplore more on these topicsArt and designPaintingExhibitionsNational GalleryArtreviewsShareReuse this content"

On other voyages you may see glorious sunsets, rare migratory birds, ruined castles and historic lighthouses. Unlike the classic road trip or the great railway journey, however, the humble ferry rarely makes it to anyone’s bucket list. They are a means to an end, only chosen by necessity. And yet, the UK has some of the best and most exhilarating voyages within its borders. From exciting river crossings to island odysseys that test the mettle of the best sea captains, these boat journeys can be the high point of any trip.Whale-watching on the way from Cornwall to the Isles of ScillyStarting from Penzance’s South Pier, in sight of St Michael’s Mount, the crossing to St Mary’s is the indispensable highlight of any trip to the Isles of Scilly. The gas-guzzling, climate-clobbering helicopter doesn’t even approach the magic of this ship and its three-hour voyage into the Atlantic Ocean. Penzance bursts with nautical heritage; many of its remarkable number of pubs have existed since the days of Captain Kidd and Francis Drake. Once aboard the Scillonian (built in Appledore, Devon, in 1977), find a position with a view to the starboard to glimpse Land’s End on departure, then keep a lookout for wildlife. Dolphins and whales are sighted regularly on the voyage. Birdlife includes gannets, Manx shearwaters and puffins. Watch out for bird feeding frenzies, which may attract the attention of bluefin tuna (the half-ton fish can leap clear of the water and numbers are rising fast). Other potential highlights include fin whales, the planet’s second largest animal after the blue whale – with several sightings in 2024.A dayreturn on theScillonian IIIis£35.Woodstock Ark, asecluded cabinnear Penzance South Pier, sleeps two, from£133a night.Star Castle Hotel,close to the Scillonian’s arrival point on St Mary’s,has great food and superb views; doubleswith dinner from £245.A tugboat tow on theRiver Dartin DevonView image in fullscreenThere has been a ferry across the River Dart since the 14th century.Photograph: Candy Apple Red Images/AlamyDartmouth has a huge heritage of sailing and boats, and the lower ferry across the mouth of the River Dart is an absolute classic. The best approach is on thesteam railwayfrom Paignton, which brings you into what was once the Great Western Railway’s imposing Kingswear station on the east bank of the river. Alternatively, you could walk to Kingswear on theSouth West Coast Pathfrom Brixham (a 10-mile yomp). There has been a ferry here since the 14th century and the latest incarnation is a barge with room for eight cars towed by a tugboat. The crossing is short but memorable, the flanks of the steeply wooded valley looming over a fast-moving tidal river that froths around the barge as it picks its way through a busy shipping lane. Landing is right in town, next to the blue plaque for John Davis, one of the great sea dogs of Devon, who searched for the Northwest Passage and died at the hands of pirates near Singapore in 1605. If the crossing has whetted the appetite, walk upriver along the historic waterfront to the Upper Dart ferry, another interesting boat. Originally a floating platform linked to cross-river chains that were pulled by horses, today it’s a diesel-electric paddle engine combined with cables that can manage about 18 cars.TheLower Dart Ferrycosts£5 return for a foot passenger; car and passengers £14 return.Ferrysideapartmentnext to the ferry in Kingswear sleeps four, from£533 for three nights.

A hop of just nine nautical miles and taking an hour, it crosses the shallow Sound of Harris, which is strewn with deadly rocks, dangerous tidal currents and frequent mists. Before GPS, it was a rule that the captain would turn back if he couldn’t see two buoys ahead, and occasionally the ship would slither on to a sandbank and have to stay there until the tide lifted her off. These days it remains an exhilarating passage, weaving between dozens of jagged hazards with evocative names such as Drowning Rock and the Black Curran. Listen for the ghostly cries of seals on the larger islets, and look out for a majestic white-tailed sea eagle.TheCaledonian MacBrayne ferrycosts£4.70 one way for a foot passenger.Camping atBalranaldonNorth Uist is highly recommended (tent £14), or try30 Backhill, a restored thatched stone croft on Berneray, from£535a week.Crossing Harwich harbourfrom Suffolk to EssexView image in fullscreenPassengers boarding the Harwich harbour ferry in Felixstowe, Suffolk.Photograph: Geog Photos/AlamyAs a shortcut at the end of the Suffolk coastal path, the ferry fromLandguard Fortnear Felixstowe to Harwich offers great panoramas of the harbour formed by the rivers Orwell and Stour. You’re likely to spot some of the planet’s largest container ships and a Thames barge. Alternatively, embark at Shotley Gate, the tip of the narrow and beautiful Shotley peninsula that separates the two rivers – the walk down the Orwell from Ipswich is particularly picturesque, taking in Pin Mill. Harwich old town is also well worth exploring, with some beautiful period buildings including the Electric Cinema, opened in 1911.TheHarwich Harbour Ferryconnects Felixstowe and Harwich (tickets £6 oneway), and Harwichand Shotley (£4.80); it runsfrom Aprilto October.

Despite some deplorable environmental mismanagement upstream, the river here remains a beautiful sight. On the far bank, take the lane north to another good pub,Ye Old Ferrie Inn. Their ferry drops you on a footpath that heads up through the woods for the fine views along the curving river from the Symonds Yat rock itself. These crags were visited in 1770, by schoolmasterWilliam Gilpin, who had an eye for untamed landscapes, triggering a revolution in the appreciation of views and nature that we still benefit from today.

This is the last manually operated turntable ferry in the world (built in Troon in 1969), carrying just six cars and 12 people on a five-minute voyage. Due to strong tidal currents running at up to nine knots and frequently windy conditions, the designers came up with the ingenious solution of aturntable to allow vehicles to disembark safely. Saved by a local campaign in 2006, it has now become a vital part of the Skye experience.TheIsle of Skye ferryfrom Glenelgcosts£3 forfoot passengers, and £20 for a car(with up to four passengers)one way.

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 5 Aug 2025 08.00 EDTShareI have just got a pizza oven, but what else can I cook in it?Sure, Neapolitan pizza and negroni nights are great, but start thinking of your pizza oven as a high-temperature furnace and there will be even more reason to stay outdoors. “I’d lean towards food that you eat charred,” says Naples-trained Kit Delamain ofCircus Pizzaat Panzer’s Deli in London. That might mean aubergines to blitz intobaba ganoush, finishing meat (think lamb) that’s been cooked low and slow “to get that really nice, charred flavour”, or to bake pitta: “They puff up ever so nicely, which is hard to achieve in a normal oven.” The same goes for pillowy naan, adds Arun Tilak, executive chef atDishoom: “Roll the dough into a round or oval shape, prick lightly with a fork and bake until beautifully golden. Brush with butter and you’re in for a treat.”Of course, pizza ovens come in different shapes and styles, but, depending on which you have, they can be “really controllable”, says Rachel Jones, founder ofACE Pizzain east London, who recently cooked a whole turbot in hers. “Start with that intense heat, which will blister the skin, before turning it down and leaving the fish to cook through.” That said, you could also have chicken tonight: “Spatchcock a chicken and marinate it in lemon zest, garlic, olive oil, rosemary and salt and pepper for at least an hour,” says Jones, who then pops the bird skin side up in a skillet and into the pizza oven on low, rotating occasionally, until cooked. “While the chicken rests, throw summer veg [courgettes, peppers, tomatoes] into the skillet with olive oil and garlic, and get that pan back in the oven.” Start the flame on high (“to get some nice char”), then turn to low and cook for another 15 minutes: “Serve with a squeeze of lemon, a scatter of fresh herbs, maybe a dollop of yoghurt and some flatbread on the side.”A pizza oven could facilitate curry night, too. “Cook chicken or vegetables in the pizza oven, then just add them to a homemade sauce,” Delamain suggests. Tilak, meanwhile, would think about charring carrots or crisping potatoes to toss with a punchy kebab masala and finish with a zippy lime and chilli dressing: “The intense heat cooks everything quickly and locks in the most amazing flavour.” His preferred dish, however, would be biryani: “Yes, even that works in a pizza oven: layer marinated chicken in the base of a pot, top it with partially cooked rice, then finish with a little cream, butter, fresh mint and coriander.” Seal with a lid and cook “ondum[AKA low and slow].”And if you fancy something sweet, flaky pastry is “at its best with the dry heat of a pizza oven,” says Tomas Topolar, head chef atOxmoor Farmin the Chiltern Hills, who adds that pizza oven galettes are easier than, well, pie: “The sweetest blackberries are those that come off easily; they almost fall into your fingers. You then only need to add lemon juice, a dusting of flour and sprinkle of sugar to make a beautiful filling.” And remember that residual heat is also your friend, Jones says: “Slice stone fruit [peaches, plums or nectarines, say], put them in a cast-iron pan, drizzle with honey and add fresh thyme.” After about 20 minutes in the oven “they’ll be lovely and sticky”. Just add yoghurt and chopped nuts for happy days.Got a culinary dilemma? Emailfeast@theguardian.comExplore more on these topicsChefsKitchen aideFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I wandered through the ancient city and was astounded by the beauty of the place – and just as much by its food. I tasted grilled meats cooked over open fires on the streets, and had a kofta dish served withcacik, a classic cucumber and mint sauce, that was so intensely delicious that the moment has been distilled in my memory. Mince, with good provenance and the right amount of fat to carry flavour and lend moisture, is a kitchen hero. Here, it delivers an astoundingly good dinner inspired by that meal, and which shouldn’t break the bank.Lamb koftas with buttery tomato sauceA deliciously savoury feast of grilled lamb, spices and dill with a richly aromatic saucePrep10 minCook1 hrServes4 with leftoversFor the spice mix2 tsp cumin seeds1 tbsp coriander seeds3-4 fat garlic cloves,peeled1 tsp ground cinnamonSalt and black pepper1 tsp ground turmeric1 tsp ground gingerFor the koftas2 tbsp vegetable or olive oil2 medium red onions, peeled and diced900g lamb mince1 large handful fresh dill, finely choppedFor the tomato sauce50g butter1 large onion, peeled and finely diced2 x 400g tins plum tomatoes2 bay leavesWarm a heavy-based casserole on a medium heat, then gently toast the cumin and coriander seeds for a few minutes. Tip them into a mortar or spice grinde, add the garlic, cinnamon and half a teaspoon of salt, and grind to a paste. Set aside half of the paste for the tomato sauce, then mix the turmeric and ginger into the remaining paste in the mortar.Meanwhile, heat the oil for the koftas in the same pan, add the two diced onions, and sweat with a teaspoon of salt for eight to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlicky paste from the mortar and, once the onions are translucent and smelling tantalisingly good, add the lamb and scrape the mix into a bowl.To make the sauce, put the same pan back on a medium heat, add the butter and onion, and season generously. After eight to 10 minutes, stir in the reserved spice paste and stir-fry for a few minutes. Cut up the tinned tomatoes with scissors or squash them to a pulp, then stir them into the pan with the bay leaves. Stir, then simmer gently over a medium heat for about 15 minutes, until the sauce is thick and glossy.Meanwhile, mix the dill in to the bowl of onions and mince, and season with a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper. Mix thoroughly, then, using your hands, shape into equal-sized, flattish torpedo shapes. You should end up with 12-14 in all.When you are ready to eat, heat a griddle, barbecue or frying pan on a high heat until smoking. Griddle or fry the koftas for two to three minutes on each side, until just cooked in the middle. Serve astride the tomato sauce with short-grain rice or bulgur wheat, some wilted spinach or chard, and the cacik below.Shredded cucumber cacikA dip that is delicious for breakfast with bread, olives and feta, and perfect for layering in a sandwich and insanely good with grilled aubergine.Prep5 minCook15 minServes4 with leftovers400g greek yoghurt2 small cucumbers, or ½ large cucumber1-2 smallgarlic cloves, peeledSalt1 small handful fresh mint leaves, finely chopped½ tsp dried mint(optional)Extra-virgin olive oilPut the yoghurt in a mixing bowl and beat it with a fork until very smooth.Top and tail the cucumbers and coarsely grate them into the same bowl.
