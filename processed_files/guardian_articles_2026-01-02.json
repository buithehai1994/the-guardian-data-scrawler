As A Thousand Blows explodes back, they talk about taking decades to become overnight sensations, the Peaky Blinders movie – and why it could be time for a scouse Bond villainFri 2 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareStephen Graham had a stellar 2025. He didn’t just play Bruce Springsteen’s father in biopic Deliver Me from Nowhere but, of course, co-created and starred in Netflix mega-hit Adolescence – the game-changing drama that sparked global debate about online misogyny, incel culture and the “manosphere”.His friend and regular collaboratorSteven Knightwatched admiringly from afar as the devastating four-parter became event TV. “My God, it was a cultural phenomenon,” he says, puffing out his cheeks with pride. “Adolescencegot people talking who don’t normally talk, about things they don’t normally talk about. Is there any finer achievement than having a direct, immediate and positive effect worldwide on human relationships? It’s like putting something on screen which is medicine. It’s actually good for you.”“Making an impact like that was beyond our wildest hopes,” says Graham. “Having a fella come up in Tesco and say: ‘I just want to thank you. I had a really good chat with my son the other night after we watched your programme.’ No disrespect but you can keep your awards and all that shiny bollocks. That’s the real accolade.”View image in fullscreenBeat surrender … Stephen Graham as Henry ‘Sugar’ in A Thousand Blows, season two.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+He hasalready won an Emmyfor Adolescence and was recently nominated for a Golden Globe but Graham retains a healthy scepticism about awards recognition. “What we do isn’t football,” he says. “It’s not competitive sport. There aren’t winners and losers. It’s subjective. I might think something’s a bag of shite and it gets five fucking Baftas. That’s happened quite a few times, in fact. I might get myself into trouble here but Cillian Murphy, right? Wonderful actor. He’s never won a Bafta for playing Tommy Shelby [in Peaky Blinders]! One of the finest performances I’ve ever seen. What the fuck’s that about? Things like Adolescence, which make an impression on the collective consciousness, come from nowhere. The fact that we got it made is in itself a win.”I am sitting down with Stephen and Steven to discuss the pyrotechnic return of their pugilistic period thrillerA Thousand Blows. The debut run was a smash hit for Disney+ last year. Now comes the sequel, which interweaves the illegal bare-knuckle boxing scene with the fortunes of the Forty Elephants, an all-female crime syndicate who specialised in pickpocketing and confidence tricks.One year after the events of the first season, Jamaican boxer Hezekiah Moscow (Malachi Kirby) is a shadow of his former fighting self. His deadly rival, Henry “Sugar” Goodson (Graham), is in even worse shape – estranged from his family and drinking himself to death. As the series begins, he’s straggly haired, bushy bearded and falling face down in puddles. He even has a nasty case of trenchfoot.“I know, it’s gross,” says Graham. “Those manky feet are a metaphor for the path Sugar has trodden in the time we’ve been away. He’s at his lowest point ever. Now he has to rebuild his sense of self.” As we know from his virtuoso turn in Shane Meadows’sThe Virtues, for a teetotaller, Graham is uncannily good at playing drunk. “I was the kind of kid who sat in working men’s clubs, getting cans of Coke and bags of crisps bought for me. I saw a lot of great pissheads! I tap into that.”View image in fullscreenHit-maker … the creator of the show, Steven Knight.Photograph: Robert ViglaskyGraham transformed his physique for the first series. With fewer fights this time, has his training slacked off? “No, I’ve still got it going on,” he says, pulling up his T-shirt to flex impressive biceps. “Look at them! This season, the fight Sugar is having is mainly with himself. But I’m still working out. I’m filming something at the minute where I play a prisoner, so I’ve adjusted the regime.” He rubs his shaven head to illustrate the point. “More of a prison workout plan with a low-carb diet.”Season one climaxed with Sugar beating his younger brother, Edward “Treacle” Goodson (James Nelson-Joyce) half to death. “These two boys went through hell growing up,” says Graham. “Everything Sugar did, he did for his brother. Now he’s betrayed that, so he’s questioning who he is as a human being.” That’s one beauty of basing his story on real historical figures, says Knight: “The truth gives our scripts authority. Records show that Sugar did badly beat his brother in a fight. All you need is that fact, then you’ve got a ton of stuff before it and after it to imagine.”Nelson-Joyce has come a long way since that fateful meeting in Nando’s a decade ago, when he approached Graham and was taken under his idol’s wing. “He really has,” says Graham. “After I gave him my details, Hannah [Walters, his wife, co-star and co-producer] looked at me and went: ‘I reckon he could play your brother one day.’ And here we are. I’m dead proud of the way James’s career is progressing. He deserves every bit of his success.”The punchy series comes out swinging for round two. This time, the bone-crunching violence spills out of the boxing ring and on to the streets of the East End. “There’s a lot more explosions and those are always exciting days to be on set,” grins Graham. “All these mad fellas and women come in and go: ‘Right, let’s blow something up over here.’ So they do it, then they always say: ‘We need bigger bangs and bigger flames. Let’s turn up the gas!’ It’s huge fun and when you see it on-screen, you go: ‘Wow.’”View image in fullscreenRivals … Graham with Malachi Kirby as Hezekiah Moscow in A Thousand Blows.Photograph: Robert Viglasky“Action scenes are great as long as nothing hits you,” says Knight. “Because it does happen. Scripting a fight feels ludicrous: ‘He swings a punch, he ducks, he swings again.’ But I genuinely think our show has the most authentic boxing sequences I’ve ever seen. The punches feel real.” He pauses. “Mentioning no names, but we’ve all seen how easy it is to do them badly.”Just as Wapping’s underworld is lacking leadership, Mary Carr (Erin Doherty), self-styled queen of the Forty Elephants, bursts back on the scene to reform her gang and reclaim her crown. As always, canny and charismatic Mary has a plan. This time, it’s riskier than ever. “Erin is unbelievable,” says Knight. “You can’t imagine anyone else playing Mary Carr. Somehow she just becomes her. I’m sure it isn’t effortless but Erin make it look like it is.”Stephen Graham: the ‘working-class, mixed-race kid’ who cares deeply about the workRead more“The only word I can use for Erin is mesmeric,” says Graham. “I could watch her reading the phone book. Mary looks after Sugar while he’s in recovery. We shot a whole day’s footage of her helping me through detox and there were scenes as an actor I’ll never forget. At one point, we sat on the floor of a bedroom above a pub and she just held me. It was a very vulnerable situation but the crew were so respectful, allowing us to stay in the moment. It was special. Something I’ll cherish deeply.”The Forty Elephants reflect the changing world of the late Victorian era. “It’s the truth. Realsocial history, rather than the stuff you read in textbooks. They ran their own organisation and were incredibly successful. Newspapers of the time were outraged and said: ‘How shocking that ladies are doing this,’ but nobody on the streets was surprised. Most working-class families are run by the mother. The only place equality wasn’t acknowledged was in the political system. In their own way, the Forty Elephants are like the suffragettes, looking around and saying: ‘Wait a minute, this is ridiculous.’”View image in fullscreen‘The only word I can use for Erin is mesmeric’ … Erin Doherty as Mary in A Thousand Blows, season two.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+The two Steves are regular partners in crime, having worked together onPeaky Blinders,TabooandA Christmas Carol. What do they admire about each other’s work? Graham goes first: “Growing up, I loved writers who told working-class stories, like Alan Bleasdale, Jimmy McGovern and Willy Russell. They’re one of the reasons I’m an actor today. Steve has that quality, too. You can imagine him writingEducating Rita. He creates these magical worlds with humour, heart and human struggle. To be in his thought process when he writes is an honour. It’s the food that gives me life.” “The motivation for me is that he’s just so good,” says Knight. “If it’s possible to get Stephen into something, then I will, because I know he’s going to be fantastic.”Next up for the pair is the long-awaited Peaky Blinders film,The Immortal Man, which dons its razor-sharp cap and swaggers on to screens in March. “I’m not allowed to talk about it but it’s fucking brilliant,” Knight says proudly. “I’m so excited that it’s coming soon.” Graham reprises his role from the TV series as Liverpool dockyard union leader Hayden Stagg. “It was a total riot to make,” he says. “I don’t normally get to do the kind of things I do in this film, so I had a lot of fun.” What kind of things? “I can’t say, can I? You won’t catch me out!”Knight isnow writingthe screenplay for the next James Bond film. “I can’t say anything about that either. Apart from it’s a dream come true.” If he’s in the market for a scouse 007, he doesn’t need to look far. “I’d rather be a villain,” says Graham. “It’d be more fun.” Knight nods: “Every great actor that I’ve spoken to has said that. They’d all rather be the villain.”He’s also been working on the third series of BBC wartime rompSAS: Rogue Heroes. The drama has led to petitions in parliament to award maverick hero Blair “Paddy” Mayne (played by Jack O’Connell) a posthumous medal. “I’m 110% in support of the campaign to give Paddy the recognition he deserves,” says Knight. “His incredible courage, mental strength and battlefield intelligence helped turn a crucial chapter of the war in favour of Britain. There’s no logical reason not to acknowledge this.”Knight’s approach to period drama views society from the bottom up, not the top down. “Why wouldn’t you do it that way?” he says. “The best stories are in those places. In any taxi or Uber, the driver’s story will almost certainly be more interesting than the passenger’s. The themes of A Thousand Blows – poverty, migration, prejudice, family, ambition, the fight for survival – are just as relevant today. There’s loads more stories I’d like to tell. I want to do something about Shakespeare.”View image in fullscreenKnock out … Stephen Graham in A Thousand Blows, season one.Photograph: Disney+The pair are both frighteningly prolific. Are they the busiest men in showbiz? “Quite possibly!” laughs Graham. “It’s taken me 30 years to become an overnight success but that’s sweet. I adore what I do. I’m a grownup Mr Benn and I love it.”“Me too,” says Knight. “I’d sit down and write stuff even if nobody wanted me to. It doesn’t feel like an effort, it’s just putting it into words fast enough.” Knight didn’t write Peaky Blinders until his 50s. Does he wish he’d become a dramatist earlier? “I do, actually. It all goes back to class. It takes 20 years to recover from a working-class upbringing. It took me that long to believe I was as good as other people, if not better.” This chimes with Graham: “It took me ages to get rid of that imposter syndrome. It’s only dissipated completely in the past five years.”Hectic schedules permitting, will A Thousand Blows be back for round three? “Fingers crossed,” says Graham. “Steve has ideas for it that are next level! If the stars align, there could be a whopper on its way. That’s all I’ll say.” Knight is staying tight-lipped. “I refer you to the answer previously given by my honourable friend,” he smiles.I leave the Steves lamenting the fortunes of their respective football teams, Liverpool and Birmingham City. “We’re the only team in Europe who failed to score a goal during the reign of a pope,” says Knight. “That’s our proud boast.” Graham is delighted by this: “That’s an amazing stat! You’ve got to squeeze that into a script sometime.” You wouldn’t put it past him.A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ fromFriday9January.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioStephen GrahamDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Think of it instead as a hope or even a plea for the next 12 months. May the coming year see those leaders who have done so much damage to their own countries, and far beyond, at last be called to account. Let 2026 be a year of reckoning.Start with the man whose reach is longest, by dint of the mighty power he wields. Such is the nature of the US electoral system thatDonald Trump, who returned to power less than a year ago, will face the judgment of voters in 10 months’ time. His name will not be on the ballot but, make no mistake, the midterm elections of 3 November will deliver a verdict on the second Trump presidency.A slew of congressional defeats for his party would be satisfying in itself, wounding that gargantuan ego of his, but it would also have practical significance. Few predict the Republicans losing control of the Senate, where Democrats would have to flip at least four seats to take charge – near-impossible giventhe geography of the 35 seatsup for grabs in November. But, in normal circumstances, it should be the safest of political bets that the House of Representatives will no longer be in Republican hands a year from now.Such a reverse would dispel the aura of indomitability that has enveloped Trump since he beat Kamala Harris, allowing him to bully and intimidate multiple US institutions, includingmuch of its media, into ceding to him far more power than is rightfully his. It would render him a lame duck, incapable of passing new laws through a hostile chamber.Above all, it would see Trump confronted at last with a body both eager and able to hold him to account: a Democratic House would have the appetite and the muscle for serious scrutiny. Armed with subpoena power, it could investigate everything fromthe cost of Trump’s tariffsfor US taxpayersto the astonishingly brazen pattern ofcorruption and pocket-liningthat has characterised this administration. And up its sleeve would be the constant threat of a third impeachment trial.So November could indeed bring a reckoning for Trump, which is why he will stop at nothing to avert that outcome. Hence the words of caution above: “in normal circumstances”. Trump will make the circumstances abnormal, if that’s what it takes to keep the House.That effort is already under way, whether in the form of gerrymandered maps in Texas or moves to make voting harder in Democratic areas across the country.There are heartening signs of institutions beginning to push back – witnesslast week’s supreme court decisionreining in Trump’s deployment of US troops on the streets of Democrat-led cities – but this willbe one of the battles of 2026, as the president stretches every sinew to avoid the accountability an autumn defeat would bring.In that, he has a soul brother inthe man he hosted in Mar-a-Lagothis week, in what was their sixth and final meeting of 2025: Benjamin Netanyahu. Except the electoral peril confronting Netanyahu, whose first term as Israel’s prime minister began in 1996, is more direct: at some point between now and October, Israelis will go to the polls in a contest that could remove him from power altogether.Central will be the holding of Netanyahu to account. Many around the world will want that to be for the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, for the relentless aerial bombardment that has left the strip in ruins and for the withholding of humanitarian aid. But insideIsrael, the accountability that is sought most keenly is for the deadly failures of 7 October 2023, for the complacency and strategic errors that left a string of southern communities, and hundreds of people at a music festival, exposed to murderous Hamas attack.Israeli officials at every level, civilian and military, have paid for that catastrophe with their jobs – bar one. Only Netanyahu has never admitted the slightest responsibility, let alone apologised, for the fact that the deadliest day in the country’s history came on his watch. He has refused to establish a commission of inquiry like those that swiftly followed previous calamities, preferring instead a sham investigation staffed by loyalists – equivalent,as the father of one slain hostage put it, to asking the iceberg to find out who sank the Titanic. So the only chance Israelis will have to hold to account the man who has ruled them for 18 of the past 30 years will be at the ballot box.The stakes could hardly be higher. Plenty of Israeli campaigners fear this election might be the last chance to save key democratic institutions that have been under sustained assault from Netanyahu for so long. Like Trump in the US or Viktor Orbán in Hungary, who also faces voters this year, Netanyahu has been in an escalating war with the judiciary and independent media, squeezing them ever harder, hoping they will choke. And, like his pal in Washington, Netanyahu will stop at nothing to deny his opponents an electoral victory: on trial on corruption charges, he needs to stay in power in order to stay out of jail. Accountability of both the political and legal varieties terrifies him.And he is not the only leader in the region fearful of the anger of his own people. Iranians have tried and tried again to vent their fury at the regime that has ruled their country for 47 years, only to be suppressed, often brutally.Protests have erupted once againin recent days, the authorities resorting to lethal force even more rapidly than in the past – though there are encouraging signs that some in the security forces are reluctant to engage in the usual crackdown. For years, many inside Iran have despaired at a regime bent on becoming a regional power by sponsoring terror and mayhem in the Middle East and beyond, with ordinary Iranians paying the price in sanctions and economic pain. The reckoning for that has been postponed, more than once. But the demand for change is loud and,says the scholar of Iran Ali Ansari, “Sooner or later something will have to give.”In the streets or at the ballot box, accountability could be coming in 2026. In Britain, the Labour government has good reason to fear it, bracing for big losses in every direction, whether to Plaid Cymru in Wales, the Scottish National party in Scotland, the Greens especially in London or Reform UK almost everywhere. In a just world, Nigel Farage would fear the voters, anxious that they would hold him to account not only forhis squalid pastbut as the man who served as chief evangelist for the most disastrous national decision since Munich, namely the Brexit referendum, which marks its 10th anniversary in June.I concede it’s unlikely that 2026 will see Farage pay for his starring role in that ongoing act of collective self-harm. But eventually Trump, Netanyahu, Orbán and the others must face a reckoning for the pain they have caused and the damage they have done.

Then I found the WSL third-tier live stream | Kieran PenderRead moreLeFebour’s disappearance features prominently inthe film Point of Change, which chronicles the “discovery” of Nias by Australian surfers in the 1970s and the oftendubious consequences for the local community.So when Point of Change had its first screening in Fremantle last month, there was one person no one expected to be among the audience – LeFebour herself.“It was a bit bizarre, actually, when I found out,” LeFebour says. “All of a sudden there’s people calling me; it was a bit overwhelming. After the screening, people came up to me and everybody wanted pictures with me, and they told me, ‘you’re a legend’, but that was all news to me.”The extraordinary story began nearly 50 years ago, when LeFebour travelled to Nias from Perth as an 18-year-old backpacker with her boyfriend at the time, Stuart, in search of a newly discovered surf spot called Lagundri Bay. It had first been surfed a year earlier by Australians Kevin Lovett and John Geisel, and in 1976 Lovett returned with his girlfriend and her siblings. They were camped out at the wave when LeFebour and Stuart joined them.View image in fullscreenIngrid LeFebour on Nias in 1976.Photograph: Kevin Lovett“I met [Stuart] in Perth and he told me about some friends of his who had discovered this island and that he was trying to go over there to meet them,” LeFebour says. “I thought, ‘That sounds like an adventure. Can I come along?’ We left together and travelled around Thailand and Indonesia.”Stuart clashed with the other surfers in Nias and left soon after but LeFebour stayed on at Lagundri. Soon, malaria hit the camp. When it became clear that serious medical treatment was needed, Lovett’s group abandoned the camp to return to Bali but LeFebour didn’t go with them. The last the others saw of her she was being carried on a stretcher atop a truck leaving the village.Point of Change review – how the arrival ‘surf explorers’ altered a tiny Indian Ocean paradiseRead moreWhen Lovett returned to Nias in the 1990s, locals told him of rumours that LeFebour had died at the hands of headhunters and suggested her head may have been buried in the foundations of a nearby bridge.Years later, in the early 2000s, the Point of Change director, Rebecca Coley, was in Nias when she first heard the story of a woman who had gone missing when surfers were camped there in the 1970s. The film chronicles the radical changes at Lagundri as a result of the influx of surfers, one of many Indonesian locations that exploded in popularity among Australians and other outsiders across the decade.While working on the film, Coley saw footage of LeFebour from the time she disappeared, prompting her to look further into the story. “The first person who told me about the Ingrid story was Safarma, an elder who was … living on the point at the time,” Coley says. “He told me the whole story about these guys that were hanging around the tourists … and they were talking about how they wanted to collect heads because they were doing a building project. Safama and a couple of the others were convinced that she’d been taken by these guys.”View image in fullscreenLeFebour in 1976 from the film Point of Change.Photograph: Kevin LovettColey had tried without success to locate LeFebour since 2016, believing the worst may have happened. “I contacted missing persons, immigration and also did obvious things like Googling and searching Facebook numerous times,” Coley says. Without knowing a last name, neither Coley nor Lovett was able to track her down.It wasn’t until friends of LeFebour heard an appeal for information on the radio in Perth that she realised others wanted to find her, and she was able to give her version of events.“I was sick in the tent [in Nias], I wasn’t eating and that’s why I was so weak that I had to be carried to the village on a stretcher,” LeFebour says. “I was delirious at the time. I don’t remember getting to the village. I was in and out of consciousness.”With a fever so high it was assumed she wouldn’t survive the night, LeFebour was placed in the morgue at a nearby clinic, where she awoke weak and disoriented but very much alive. She wrapped the sheet meant to cover her corpse around her body and toppled off the slab to search for help.“I didn’t know where I was, what had happened or where the rest of them were,” LeFebour says. “There were these French-type doors, very flimsy, so I pushed them open and crawled out. Somebody came along and I think I gave them the shock of their lives.”View image in fullscreenLeFebour and Rebecca Coley at the West Australian premiere of Point of Change in December.Photograph: Rebecca ColeyRecalling the events now, LeFebour pieces together that she had traded a gold mesh cigarette box that a friend had given her before the trip to buy a spot on the ferry to Medan, the nearest city on the island of Sumatra. “I remember when they put me on the ferry, I was lying down,” she says. “I couldn’t even sit up and it was a very rough crossing.”Stephanie Gilmore to return from hiatus and surf on next year’s world tour at age 38Read moreStill too weak to eat solid food or walk, LeFebour slowly began her recovery. Eventually she returned to Perth, where she experienced recurring bouts of malaria for months until she was treated at Royal Perth Hospital and fully recovered.The seriousness of what had happened didn’t deter LeFebour from future travels. She went on to hitchhike solo around Australia and continue her intrepid life.For LeFebour, what happened at Nias was just part of the journey.“This got me thinking about a lot of my adventures,” she says. “I mean, you just move on with your life.”Coley says she had always hoped LeFebour would turn up at the screening in WA.“I couldn’t believe it when it actually happened and she had her own amazing version of events. It really seems like a miracle that she made it home alive.”Explore more on these topicsSurfingAustralia sportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other Trump critics, including Richard Gere, Lena Dunham and Ryan Gosling, have upped sticks without citing the re-election as a motivating factor.In the case of Clooney, however, there has appeared little doubt that his decision to gain French citizenship was primarily because of Trump, whose re-election he energetically campaigned against. Yet amid the heat and headlines generated by the pair’s war of words, some of the actor’s reasons for relocating may have flown under the radar.‘He’ll become an ambassador for the Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée’The Clooneys’ 170-hectare (420-acre) Provence estate, capped by an 18th-century chateau, encompasses a swimming pool, ornamental lake, lavender garden, boules pitch and olive grove. It also includes a 20-acre vineyard, planted 25 years ago by agronomist Laurence Berlemont, whose previous clients include Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at Château Miraval, just 30 minutes away. Under Berlemont’s steering, the wines of Miraval have become lucrative and celebrated, with healthy international sales and rosettes from Le Guide Hachette des Vins.View image in fullscreenBrignoles in the Var, France, where the Clooney’s  Domain du Canadel is located.Photograph: Laurent Laurent Vu/Sipa/ShutterstockEven closer to the Clooneys is George Lucas’s Château Margüi – AKA Skywalker Vineyards – a substantial wine and olive oil making enterprise (plus high-end holiday lets). Also nearby is Le Plan-de-la-Tour, the estate formerly owned by Johnny Depp, featuring vineyards, olive groves, and a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed wine cave. The estates of celebrity vintners such as Kylie Minogue, John Malkovich and Jon Bon Jovi are also in the area.Historically, the fruits of the vines at the estate now owned by the Clooneys have been fed into the local cooperative, but the president of the Coteaux Varois appellation syndicate appeared eager for the incomers to “exploit the vineyard”.“In buying in our region,” said Eric Lambert, “[Clooney] will certainly become a new ambassador for the AOC [Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée].” Meanwhile, Berlemont hassaidClooney joined her for blending sessions, and praised his “good palate”. “He’s very humble,” she added, “ready to listen”.There were evenmurmuringsin the wine press that the Clooneys would debut a rosé and a white as early as 2025. That has not come to pass, yet Clooney is no stranger to alcoholic entrepreneurship: in 2017 he sold Casamigos – the tequila brand he co-founded four years earlier – for $1bn (£790m).‘I don’t want my kids to be worried about paparazzi’Both Lucas and Jolie-Pitt’s wines have benefited from high-profile partnerships with the nearby Cannes film festival. Yet Clooney’s association with European film festivals has been predominantly with Cannes’ rival in Venice. At least 10 of his films, including Jay Kelly last August, Wolfs the year before and his own directorial efforts – Suburbicon (2017), The Ides of March (2011) and Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) – have premiered on the Lido; he has only been to Cannes twice.View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney’s Lake Como villa.Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockClooney’s affection for Italy has been long and mutual. In 2002, he bought a villa on Lake Como, and he and his wife,Amal Clooney, the British-Lebanese human rights barrister married in Venice in 2014. A 2012 profile of the actor noted that he was “fast becoming the most popular public figure in Italy … despite [being a man] who isn’t Italian, doesn’t speak Italian, and lives here only in summertime.”So why did the Clooneys not seek Italian citizenship? A clue may lie in the actor’s praise for France’s privacy laws. In an interview withEsquire in October, Clooney said: “I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood. I don’t want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don’t want them being compared to somebody else’s famous kids.”Italian rules over publishing photographs of people in public without their consent have strengthened over the past decade, and are tighter than those in the US. Yet France’s are nonetheless more stringent, and the climate surrounding celebrity less excitable, especially in rural areas. Meanwhile, the secluded location of the Clooneys’ French estate acts a significant deterrent to those hoping for a photo. By contrast, anyone with a rowing boat can in theory gain a commanding view of the villas overlooking Lake Como.‘Significant consequences … including suspension of entry into the US’Others have questioned why Clooney did not apply for British citizenship, given that he and Amal have family there, as well as a house in Windsor since 2014. Amal also has chambers in London and two fellowships at Oxford – not the easiest commute from rural Provence.Yet it is her involvement on a 2024 advisory panel reviewing the international criminal court investigation into potential war crimes in Gaza that offers the strongest indication as to why the couple felt it imperative to relocate their family from Los Angeles.View image in fullscreenThe Clooneys at the Venice premiere of Wolves in 2024.Photograph: Fabio Frustaci/EPAIn April 2024, Clooney and her fellow panellists recommended that the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan issue an arrest warrant for Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuand former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant. In her statement, Clooney said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.A warrant was issued in November 2024, and the following February, Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC and naming Khan in its annexe, promising to “impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC’s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members”.Last April, Amal was among a number of senior legal counsels to the ICCwarnedby the Foreign Office that they could be at risk of sanctions by the Trump administration, including being banned from entering the US.Much has been made of the need for the Clooneys to fast-track their French citizenship application before tougher requirements over language fluency are brought in at the start of 2026 (George’s French reportedly remains rusty). Yet the prospect of the whole family being unable to re-enter the US also seems likely to have hastened their exit.Explore more on these topicsFilmGeorge ClooneyAmal ClooneyEuropeUS politicsDonald TrumpCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Premier League footballers are all at it – and so are professional piano players,UFC championsandArianna Huffington. But if you haven’t got a dedicated nap-room or a job that encourages regular snoozing, are therereallyenough benefits to a burst of shut-eye for it to be worth the kerfuffle? Is there a reliable way to get to sleep quickly enough? And can you really guarantee you’ll wake up feeling better, not worse?“There are three main reasons for napping among most adults,” says Clare Anderson, the University of Birmingham’s professor of sleep and circadian science. “The first is what we call compensatory napping, which is what you do when you’ve had insufficient sleep the night before. The second is prophylactic napping, where you are pre-empting insufficient sleep coming up, for instance if you’re working on night shifts. The third is called “appetitive drive”, which basically comes down to desire: you have an opportunity to sleep during the day, and it feels nice to do it.”The first thing to do, then, is consider your nap motivation. “Naps can be genuinely useful when night sleeping is being disrupted for reasons outside your control – for instance, if you’re a new parent, or you’re recovering from illness or heavy physical exertion,” says Stephanie Romiszewski, a sleep physiologist and author of Think Less,SleepMore. “But if you’re napping because your night sleep feels fragile or unreliable, that’s often a sign your sleep drive is not where it needs to be. In those cases, naps can become part of the problem, not the solution. Use napping as a short-term solution for short-term problems – the priority should still be a strong and predictable night’s sleep.”This means that naps shouldn’t be long enough to interfere with your sleep at night, and ideally shouldn’t take place after about 3pm (depending on what time you go to bed at night). How long is sensible? Recommendations vary. In one of themost-cited studieson the subject, Nasa found that astronauts experienced up to a 54% increase in alertness and a 34% increase in performance after a 26-minute nap (technically, this included a six-minute nodding-off period). “I’d suggest setting an alarm for 20 to 30 minutes – most people are asleep within 10 minutes,” says the sleep expert James Wilson. “There’s a lot of advice around about the ideal number of minutes for actually sleeping, but that tends to make people feel more worried than anything – and the worst thing you can do when trying to get to sleep is worry about it.”If you’re going to sleep for longer, avoid the 45-60 minute window that encourages sleep inertia, that spaced-out feeling when you wake. “The science would say it’s better to have a longer nap of 60 to 90 minutes than a medium-length one,” says Anderson. “Forty-five minutes is long enough to put you into deep sleep and you’re more likely to feel groggy when you wake up – whereas if you take it slightly longer to 60 or 90 minutes, you’re likely to be on the end of a sleep cycle and will probably wake up feeling more refreshed. Though if you’re sleeping for 90 minutes, it will affect how you sleep that night.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s got to be some drive there to bring the sleep on in the first place.’Photograph: Posed by model; Galina Zhigalova/Getty ImagesAs for exact methodologies, recommendations vary. Some experts suggest using the same protocol you’d use to encourage a good night’s sleep: a quiet room, a comfortable bed and as much darkness as you can manage. Others suggest that you should just doze on the sofa in whatever light happens to be around – both to discourage sleep inertia and to “protect” your bedroom as the place your mind associates withrealsleep. “Sleep is something really tricky to force,” says the sleep coach Tracy Hannigan. “If you don’t have any sleepiness, it is more challenging to lie down and essentially command yourself to fall asleep. There’s got to be some drive there to bring the sleep on in the first place. I can usually take a nap in broad daylight and naturally wake up without an alarm, but what helps a lot of people is to wait for a moment that they’re naturally feeling a bit drowsy and just gently relax into it.”It’s worth experimenting, and if your choices are limited – for instance, if you’re trying to squeeze in 40 winks on a train or in a soundproof office pod – there’s nothing wrong with bringing some accessories. “When I’m working with footballers, I recommend that they don’t get used to napping in bed, because they’re going to have to learn to sleep on the move a lot, whether that’s in hotel rooms or on the team coach,” says Wilson. “But what we do in that case is bring an eye mask and some earbuds, and listen to something relaxing. The mask is a helpful tool, because over time your body learns to make the association and go ‘Oh, OK, we’re having a nap now.’”Other rituals, from deep breathing to putting on The Archers, work in a similar way – if you only do them when you’re ready for some shut-eye, your nervous system should quickly make the associations. If you choose music, though, Wilson says it should be something you like, not something you think should promote sleep. “I meet a surprising amount of people who think they should listen to whale noises or Enya or something,” he says. “But if that’s not your thing, you’re going to be too annoyed by it to actually go to sleep.” It’s worth noting that snoozing is a skill, and one that might improve with practice –one interesting studyof high-performing athletes suggests that they’re high in what scientists call “sleepability”, meaning that they’re good at drifting off to the land of nod. It’s possible (though not mentioned in the study) that this ability to shut off the outside world is also what makes them good at their chosen sports: if you can take a penalty with a crowd hooting at you, why wouldn’t you be able to grab 40 winks on a noisy coach?As for getting up after a nap, it should feel normal and natural: if you wake up groggier than you started, it’s a clear sign that you’ve slept for too long. If you really want to supercharge the whole process, then the productivity-bro-endorsed “caffeine nap” really does work: “Caffeine takes aabout 20 minutes to get into your system, so having an espresso before you lie down can help your alertness when you wake up,” says Anderson. Just remember to avoid caffeine after 3pm so it doesn’t affect your night-time sleep.View image in fullscreen‘An eye-mask is a helpful tool, because over time your body learns to make the association and go “Oh, OK, we’re having a nap now.”’Photograph: Posed by models; SolStock/Getty ImagesIs there an argument for enforcing a nap even if you’re already getting a decent amount of sleep, staying on top of everything during the day and you don’t feel especially tired? One of the best-known studies on “deliberate practice”, for instance, found thatmany top musiciansreported taking daily naps, while some studies report thatabout 50% of athleteshave regular daytime snoozes. But maybe that means you only really need to nap if you’re putting your body, brain or both through serious bouts of exertion. “The general rule for athletes is to get nine or 10 hours of sleep rather than seven to nine hours,” says Wilson. “I don’t really like putting numbers on these things, but part of the equation for anyone who’s doing a lot is that they probably just need more sleep overall.”Meanwhile, if you’re at a low ebb in the early afternoon, it’s worth remembering that that’s just a part of your body’s natural rhythms rather than a sign that you need to hit the conference room with a pillow. “It’s probably not because you’ve had a heavy lunch, so much as your natural circadian rhythms,” says Anderson. “There’s definitely some evidence that napping is associated with improved alertness, reduced fatigue and so on, but you don’t need it every day to get the benefits. It’s something to use as and when you need it.”In other words, if you’ve got time to nap, you like doing it and it seems to leave you more awake than groggy, it’s worth doing. If you feel fine without it, you’re not missing anything. “If you wake up refreshed, function well and stay alert through the day, a nap won’t transform your performance because there is not much to fix,” says Romiszewski. “Treat naps as an occasional support when life demands it, not a daily strategy. A strong sleep baseline built on consistent mornings – regular wake-up time followed by light exposure, movement and realistic expectations – will always beat the perfect nap routine.”Explore more on these topicsSleepHow to have a better dayHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

To clarify, I’m currently in excellent health (sorry to my enemies), but I’m sensing a spectacular midlife crisis on the horizon that could spell the end.Maybe it’ll be an overdose in a seedy nightclub. Maybe I’ll drink myself into oblivion. Maybe I’ll get kicked in the head during an orgy. Whatever it is, it’ll be the result of a botched attempt at compensating for a lifetime of being the world’s most risk averse, law-abiding scaredy cat who is terrified of physical danger.Let me explain. I don’t smoke. I don’t do drugs. I’ve never been drunk. (I drink, but never enough that I’ve ever vomited, passed out, or needed a designated driver.) I don’t have tattoos. I don’t like jaywalking and when I do try it, I feel nervous about it. In other words, I’m boring, and often fear the worst. If being cool means having an air of nonchalance, I am firmly “chalant”.In this fractured and frightening world, one mantra my parents gave me calls meRead moreSometimes I look at people who make risky decisions and feel a deep sense of envy. But when that envy materialises, so too does the voice of my mother and the Cantonese idiom she has repeated throughout my life: 要靚唔要命jiu leng m jiu ming.Translated literally, it means: ‘[you] want beauty, [you] don’t want life’. It’s the kind of judgmental observation you make about someone who has clearly prioritised their appearance over their physical wellbeing.See that person walking barefoot and blistered after a big night, with their high heels in hand? 要靚唔要命jiu leng m jiu ming.See that person riding their bike without a helmet because it’ll mess up their hair? 要靚唔要命jiu leng m jiu ming.See how that person can’t wipe their arse properly because of their acrylic nails? 要靚唔要命jiu leng m jiu ming.Beyond its literal meaning, the idiom also speaks more broadly to the misguidedness of “looking cool” rather than being practical, which is viewed more favourably in Chinese culture because we’re obsessed with longevity. It’s why, from a young age, my mother praised me for never leaving the house without a jacket and always tying my shoelaces in double knots. “So sensible,” she would say.View image in fullscreenMichelle Law and her mother Jenny Phang in 1991.Photograph: Michelle LawBut from my teens to mid-20s, I became defiant. Suddenly, I needed to be cool. I needed to be beautiful. Who cared about being healthy?I slathered makeup over pimply and inflamed skin. I squeezed myself into tube tops and miniskirts in the height of winter. I demanded my orthodontic braces be removed earlier for my school formal photos. I got my nails done at salons even after the tools gave me a fungal infection or two. My mother was horrified that I’d bought into the allure of being “trendy” and “sexy”, which in hindsight was impossible because as a teenager my go-to hairstyle was a low ponytail with a middle part so severe I resembled a founding father.By the time I reached my late 20s, during which my health and weight fluctuated, my priorities shifted again. Suddenly I was swapping out aesthetic looks for any wardrobe basics that came with pockets and didn’t require ironing. Over time, I began dressing like a repressed Asian housewife: all flowing trousers, oversized cotton shirts, and sun-safe bucket hats.I’ve recently become a mother with no time to care about how I’m perceived. These days, I’ve swapped out makeup for sunscreen. I’ve swapped out a purse for a hideous and enormous nappy bag. I’ve swapped out jewellery and other accessories for a cross-body phone case, which is the equivalent of one of those eyewear retainers popularised by pensioners. I don’t even wear pants any more; instead, I wear leggings because of the amount of incidental exercise involved with caring for a baby.It’s inevitable that my son will be the bearer of my generational, idiom-based trauma. Despite the fact he’s been given suitcase-loads of extremely adorable clothes – the kinds of threads worn by curated, influencer babies on Instagram – I’ve fished out all of the soft, stretchy and breathable onesies that won’t irritate his eczema. He’s a baby. All he needs is to be safe, loved and comfortable. Until … I suppose … he reaches an age where that’s no longer enough, and I’ll have to remind him: 要靚唔要命jiu leng m jiu ming.Michelle Law is an Australian writer and author of the book Sh*t Asian Mothers SayExplore more on these topicsFamilyHome truthsAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pilloud said the investigation would examine the bar’s compliance with safety regulations.As efforts to identify the victims continued, Pilloud said investigators would focus on the materials used in the renovation of the bar and its basement, its operating licence, the availability of fire extinguishers and emergency exits, as well as the number of people in the venue when the fire began.One image circulating online on Friday appeared to show the ceiling of the basement where the new year’s party was being held, apparently clad with foam soundproofing panels, catching fire as the sparklers were held aloft.Mathias Reynard, the president of the Valais regional government, said authorities were working as fast as possible to identify the victims, many of whom had been severely burned, a process that officials said earlier could take several days.Reynard said experts were using dental records, DNA samples and clothing descriptions in the “terrible and sensitive” task of identifying the badly burned bodies. “Nothing can be told to the families unless we are 100% sure,” he said.Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old international golfer from Italy who lived in Dubai, was named on Friday as the first of several possible Italian victims of the disaster to be identified.In a post on its website, the Italian Golf Federation paid tribute to Emanuele Galeppini as a ‘young athlete who embodied passion and authentic values’.Photograph: Italian Golf FederationPope Leo expressed his “compassion and solicitude” and said he was praying that “the Lord will welcome the deceased into His abode of peace and light, and sustain the courage of those who suffer in their hearts or in their bodies”.The Valais police chief, Frédéric Gisler, said 119 people had been injured, 113 of whom had been identified. Among the injured are 71 Swiss, 14 French, 11 Italians, four Serbs, and one person each from Bosnia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal.Eric Bonvin, the director of the regional hospital in Sion, told the press conference that the type of injuries received by most of the wounded “will need to be treated for a very long time”.The EU said it had contacted Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said some of the injured were being cared for in French hospitals. Others were being treated in Germany and Poland.Gisler said the death toll still stood at 40, with formal identification continuing. A ceremony will be held on 9 January in Crans-Montana to give the shellshocked, close-knit community in the mountain resort a chance to remember the victims.Stéphane Ganzer, a regional health and safety official, told RTL radio earlier on Friday that “a large number” of the injured were in a critical condition. “When 15% or more of an adult’s body has third-degree burns, there is a risk of death,” he said.Ganzer told the press conference the families of the victims would receive psychological support from the police, describing the tragedy as “unprecedented in the history of our canton”. About 40 police officers were still on the scene, he said.Pilloud said no criminal liability had yet been established, adding that it was “essential that we do not make any assumptions”. It was not clear when the last fire checks at the bar were carried out, but no irregularities were reported.The prosecutor said the owners of the bar had been questioned, but not under caution. If there were grounds to suspect their liability, “an investigation will be opened for negligent arson, negligent homicide, and negligent bodily injury”.French media, citing property records, have saidthe bar is owned by two French nationals, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who bought it in 2015 and also owned two other establishments in the area including a hamburger restaurant in the town.A friend of the couple, who are originally from Corsica and arrived in the area in the early 2000s, said Jessica Moretti, who was in the bar when the fire broke out, had been burned on the arm. Both have since been unreachable.Several witness accounts reported by the Swiss, French and Italian media said restaurant staff had held sparklers mounted on champagne bottles high as part of a regular show for patrons, who made special orders to their tables.There were “waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers”, one witness, Axel, told the Italian media outlet Local Team. “They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire.”View image in fullscreenAn image that has been circulating online that appears to show the moment just before the ceiling caught fire. The image may have been subjected to some digital enhancement.A Swiss fire expert, Markus Knorr,told the Swiss outlet 20 Minutesthat the type of soundproofing panels apparently used “burn fast and burst into flames” unless fireproofed, and fire could “spread extremely fast since they are mounted horizontally”.Concerns have also been raised about the number of exits from the bar’s basement, which was used for special events and reportedly accessible from the ground floor only by a single staircase that several survivors described as narrow.

I fell back to sleep and then saw the news in the morning. It seems that so many young people have lost their lives. We’ve never experienced anything like this.”graphic of resortArlino Marchese and his friend Sacha Dimic, from the nearby town of Sierre, were in Crans-Montana to ski on Friday. “We used to go to Le Constellation a lot when we were younger,” said Dimic. “It was a good bar, with a good atmosphere and really popular. All those lives gone, it’s terrible.”Piermarco Pani, an 18-year-old who, like many others in the town, knew the bar well, said: “They were people like us.” Dozens of people left flowers or lit candles on a makeshift altar at the top of the road leading to the bar, which police had cordoned off.Elisa Sousa, 17, told Reuters she was meant to have been at Le Constellation on Thursday night but had spent the evening at a family gathering instead. “I’ll need to thank my mother a hundred times for not letting me go,” she said at the vigil.The Swiss president, Guy Parmelin, who visited the mountain resort on Thursday, said the country would hold five days of mourning to mark what he described as one of the most traumatic events in its history.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said on X: “Our thoughts are with all the victims and their families.

Five representatives of West Midlands police were also present.According to the document, the force told the group it had “significant intelligence indicating potential for disorder” involvingMaccabi Tel Avivfans “based on recent fixtures”, citing incidents in Italy, Norway and Amsterdam.“Other sports, eg baseball in Holland, have also seen disorder when Israeli teams were involved,” police said according to the minutes.“These incidents suggest that Maccabi Tel Aviv’s presence could attract protest and disorder, even outside the football context.”Police also said that there was a “high likelihood of protest activity linked to the fixture whether aimed at MTA [Maccabi Tel Aviv] supporters or MTA themselves. This sits at the highest threat,” according to the document.However, the force also acknowledged the risk level of the match remained at “medium” without away fans due to community tensions and the potential for spontaneous protest.The decision to introduce the ban, which was not objected to by any members of the group, was made on the rationale that there was a “high risk associated with the presence of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans” and that “community tensions could be exacerbated”.The head of West Midlands police has been recalled to parliament next Tuesday by the Home Affairs Committee, which is scrutinising the decision to ban away fans.Ahead of the hearing,further details have been providedby chief constable Craig Guildford from West Midlands police about the intelligence that led to the ban – including notes of an email summarising a meeting between the head of WMP’s football unit and Dutch police.The email notes “violent confrontations” that took place before a match between Ajax and Maccabi Aviv in Amsterdam in 2024, including alleged incidents of Muslim taxi drivers being pulled from vehicles and the singing of anti-Muslim and anti-Gaza chants.On the day of the fixture, there was a ”national mobilisation of Muslim youths” travelling to Amsterdam “to seek retribution” – the notes state – with reported hit-and-run incidents on Maccabi fans.The government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, Lord Mann, had previously described a number of the claims made by West Midlands police as “inaccurate” and said the force had “conflated different things”.The Times reported thatDutch police were “surprised” by claimsattributed to them by the WMP force.The leader of Birmingham city council, John Cotton, and other council bosses are due to be quizzed by MPs next week.In a letter to the chair of the Home Affairs Committee in December, Birmingham city council’s executive director of city operations said there would be an independent review to “ascertain what can be improved from a governance perspective”.West Midlands police were approached but declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsAntisemitismMaccabi Tel AvivBirminghamAston VillaFreedom of informationnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research revealsRead moreGoogle searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.A Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.The Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platformsgave inaccurate financial advice, while similar concerns have been raised aboutsummaries of news stories.Sophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.Stephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”The Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.Anna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.Jewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”Typing “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.Pamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”A search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”Lamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.The Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.Some of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.Some also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”Google said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.The company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAI (artificial intelligence)HealthCharitiesAlphabetComputingVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

You could see the helicopter so close to the house it was incredible.“The sea could have been very dangerous, the water is very bitter and if they are in that water they do not have long. It is a dangerous place to be.“It was freezing, and when the sea is as harsh as it is, every care needs to be taken, you need to be at your wisest,” he said.HM Coastguard said that the search was continuing.The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has issued advice warning that the effects of cold water shock, combined with weather conditions, pose a risk to anyone entering water that is 15C or below, particularly at a time of year when the average sea temperature around the UK and Ireland is 6C to 10C.Gareth Morrison, the head of water safety for the RNLI, said: “We know this time of year many people take part in festive and new year dips, or continue to take part in regular winter swims. We are urging anyone entering the water to be aware of the dangers, check sea conditions carefully and to understand their own limitations.“With the sea temperatures still dropping and reaching their coldest around March, the effects of cold water, combined with weather conditions and any personal health issues, should be taken seriously before venturing in.”The operation in Yorkshire comes after a 51-year-old man died in the sea at Brighton on New Year’s Day.Sussex police were alerted at 10.35am on Thursday after the swimmer, from Kettering, Northamptonshire,was recovered from the water to the west of Brighton Palace Pier.Explore more on these topicsYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Thechatbot, a product of Musk’s company xAI, has been generating a wave of sexualized images throughout the week in response to user prompts.Screenshots shared by users onXshowed Grok’s public media tab filled with such images. xAI said it was working to improve its systems to prevent future incidents.‘They sowed chaos to no avail’: the lasting legacy of Elon Musk’s DogeRead more“There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing,” Grok said in aposton X in response to a user. “xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.”“As noted, we’ve identified lapses in safeguards and are urgently fixing them—CSAM is illegal and prohibited,” xAIpostedto the @Grok account on X, referring to child sexual abuse material.Many users on X have prompted Grok to generate sexualized, nonconsensual AI-altered versions of images in recent days, in some cases removing people’s clothing without their consent. Musk on Thursday reposted an AI photo of himself in a bikini, captioned with cry-laughing emojis, in a nod to the trend.Grok’s generation of sexualized images appeared to lack safety guardrails, allowing for minors to be featured in its posts of people, usually women, wearing little clothing, according to posts from the chatbot. In a reply to a user on X on Thursday, Grok said most cases could be prevented through advanced filters and monitoring although it said “no system is 100% foolproof”, adding that xAI was prioritising improvements and reviewing details shared by users.Child predators are using AI to create sexual images of their favorite ‘stars’: ‘My body will never be mine again’Read moreWhen contacted for comment by email, xAI replied with the message: “Legacy Media Lies”.The problem of AI being used to generate child sexual abuse material is a longstanding issue in theartificial intelligenceindustry. A 2023 Stanford studyfoundthat a dataset used to train a number of popular AI image-generation tools contained over 1000 CSAM images. Training AI on images of child abuse can allow models to generate new images of children being exploited, experts say.Grok also has a history of failing to maintain its safety guardrails and posting misinformation. In May of last year, Grok began posting about thefar-right conspiracy of “white genocide”in South Africa on posts with no relation to the concept. xAI also apologized in July after Grok began posting rape fantasies andantisemitic material, includingcalling itself “MechaHitler”and praising Nazi ideology.

Ovenden said the solution was a “government with a stiffened spine and renewed purpose” that could dismantle much of the system quickly and find its nerve again.Ovenden’s analysis is shared by many in Downing Street, including the prime minister,who complainedlast month: “Every time I go to pull a lever there are a whole bunch of regulations, consultations, [and] arm’s-length bodies that mean that the action from pulling the lever to delivery is longer than I think it ought to be.”However, a number of figures with expertise in government said ministers ultimately remained in charge and already had the power to change the system they complained about.Alex Thomas, the programme director at the Institute for Government, said: “I don’t think he’s wrong on it being hard to get stuff done, but am not sure the ‘stakeholder’ framing is helpful.“Government should be talking to people … and we know what the problems with government are – a weak centre in a highly centralised state, a lack of expertise because of political and civil service churn, and poor performance management. What’s needed to address those is sustained focus and political agency.”Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the senior civil servants’ union, said the prime minister and his team had the ability to change the system if they wanted to, and Ovenden’s diagnosis of “conflicting power bases” was a “reasonable analysis”.He said: “If you think that’s got to change, it’s only there because ministers put it there in the first place. The civil service didn’t put it there. And it can only change if there’s strong political will to change it.”A formerLabouradviser and aide to Tony Blair, John McTernan, said ministers had to bear responsibility for the government’s current position.He said: “The biggest errors this government has made – including cutting winter fuel payments, trying to cut disability payments and refusing to cut the two-child benefit cap until recently – have been made by No 10 in conjunction with the Treasury.“This is a government that is always getting its own way but is always looking for someone else to blame for the consequences of its own actions.”Another former Labour adviser, Tom Baldwin, Starmer’s biographer, said it was right for the government to focus on issues important to voters at a time when delivering change was “grindingly difficult”, but reforming Whitehall risked becoming a distraction.He said: “Although almost everyone says Whitehall’s often sclerotic machinery can be improved, I’m pretty sure the PM wants to start the new year by talking about issues that really matter to the public like living standards, public services, immigration and the intensely dangerous situation abroad.“Banging on about Whitehall quangos or red tape would be yet another distraction or even risk creating the impression that you’re just making excuses.”The government declined to comment on Ovenden’s intervention, his first public remarks sinceresigningin September after it emerged he had sent inappropriate messages about the Labour MP Diane Abbott eight years earlier.As one of a handful of advisers close to Starmer since his days in opposition, Ovenden’s departure was widely regarded as a blow to the prime minister.Ovenden said Abd el-Fattah’s case was one of several examples of the government becoming distracted from its main objectives, alongside rows overreparations for former coloniesandbanning smoking in pub gardens.He said: “At a time when the public is getting more and more frustrated, more and more fed up with inaction, more and more fed up with distraction, in my opinion, we simply can’t afford to be spending their time on what I consider distractions.”Explore more on these topicsCivil serviceKeir StarmerLabourShareReuse this content"

It is considered the oldest known hominin, or member of the human lineage since the evolutionary split with chimpanzees.“Based on the features we’ve found, this would have looked like a bipedal ape, most similar to a chimpanzee or bonobo,” said Dr Scott Williams, an associate professor at New York University and the lead author on the study. While chimps and bonobos can walk upright for short stretches, they are mostly knuckle-walkers.The curse of Toumaï: an ancient skull, a disputed femur and a bitter feud over humanity’s originsRead moreThe work is the latest in adebate that has ragedsince 2001, when a handful ofSahelanthropusfossils were recovered from the Djurab desert in Chad. When the findingwas made public, the lead researcher on the team, Prof Michel Brunet at the University of Poitiers in France, suggestedSahelanthropuswalked upright because of how it carried its head. He declared the species “the ancestor of all humankind”.Other scientists were less convinced thatSahelanthropusbelongedto the human lineage. And without more bones, particularly from the lower body, it was hard to nail down how it got around. A partial thigh bone and forearm bones fromSahelanthropuslater emerged, but failed to resolve the debate: researchers still disagreed overwhetheror notit belonged to an upright walker.In this latest research, Williams and his colleagues decided to re-examine the thigh and forearm bone with new techniques, comparing their size, proportion and 3D contours with bones from known hominins and apes. One feature in particular caught their eye: a bump on theSahelanthropusthigh bone called the femoral tubercle.View image in fullscreenCrania, ulnae and femora of (left to right): a chimpanzee, Sahelanthropus and Australopithecus.Photograph: Scott Williams/NYU and Jason Heaton/University of Alabama Birmingham“It’s the attachment point for the largest and most powerful ligament in our bodies,” Williams said. “When we’re seated, that ligament is loose and when we stand it tightens up. It prevents your torso from falling backward or from side to side as you walk around, so it’s a really important adaptation for bipedal walking. As far as I know, this has only been identified in bipedal hominins.”The analysis revealed further hallmarks of upright walking that other teams have spotted, such as the natural twist in the thigh bone that helps the leg point forward, and buttock muscles that keep the hips stable and aid in standing, walking and running. Details arepublished in Science Advances.For Williams, the evidence points to an ape-like animal that lived around the time of the evolutionary split between humans and chimpanzees, and walked upright on the ground, if not all the time. “We think the earliest hominins were adapting to terrestrial bipedalism,” he said, “but were still relying on trees for foraging and seeking safety.”But the case is far from closed. Dr Marine Cazenave at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, said most of the results pointed to similarities with African great apes or extinct apes, and called the evidence for upright walking “weak”. She found the femoral tubercle unconvincing too, adding that it is not directly related to upright walking and was “very faint” in a “highly damaged” region of the thigh bone.Dr Rhianna Drummond-Clarke, at the same institute, found some of the evidence convincing, but still had questions. “More work is needed to clarify whether walking on two feet was used to walk in the trees, or to move on the ground, the latter of which is a defining feature of the human lineage,” she said. The results could equally suggestSahelanthropuswas an early chimpanzee that became less upright, and a knuckle-walker, as it evolved, she said.Dr Guillaume Daver and Dr Franck Guy at the University of Poitiers, who havelong arguedthatSahelanthropuswas bipedal, welcomed the new evidence, but said the debate would not be settled without more fossils, which they hope to find when the Chadian-French team return to the site this year. That appears to be something everyone agrees on. “I think it’s a case of too few fossils and too many researchers,” said Williams.Explore more on these topicsPalaeontologyEvolutionPrimatologyResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

The Swiss ski resort was well known to them, having spent summers here with their families, and a big draw was marking the new year in the bar that in recent years had become known as the place to be.Eight from the group managed to escape the inferno that ripped through Le Constellation, killing about 40 people, while three are among the 80 who were critically injured. Two of the eldest, Marco, 20, and Gabriele, 18, had planned to join their friends in the venue – appreciated by young people for being an affordable place to party in a resort popular with celebrities and wealthy skiers – shortly after midnight but by a last-minute twist of fate decided not to.Achille Barosi is missing after the fire.Photograph: Family handoutNow they are searching for the four among them who were still missing as of Friday evening, including Achille Barosi and Chiara Costanzo, both 16. “Sometimes that is how destiny plays out,” said Gabriele, standing beside a floral and candle tribute at the scene. “It is devastating.”Another Italian who was not with them, Emanuele Galeppini, a 17-year-old international golfer who lived in Dubai, was the first of the victims to be identified publicly. His uncle, Sebastiano Galeppini, told the Italian news agency Ansa that the family was awaiting DNA checks, but the Italian Golf Federation announced on its website that he had died.A British-educated teenager, Charlotte Niddam, believed to be 15, was also reported missing. A spokesperson for Immanuel College in Bushey, Hertfordshire, said: “We are reaching out with an urgent request for our school community to come together in support of Charlotte Niddam. Charlotte was a student at Immanuel College and her family have now moved back to France. The families have asked that we all keep them in our thoughts and prayers during this extremely difficult time. We are all praying for a miracle for Charlotte and the others.”View image in fullscreenA social media post about Charlotte Niddam, who previously attended Immanuel College in Hertfordshire.Photograph: Instagram/@cransmontana.avisderechercheSwiss prosecutors said the fire appeared to have been started by sparklers placed in the tops of champagne bottles that were moved too close to the venue’s ceiling.“From that a blaze began very quickly,” Beatrice Pilloud, the attorney general for Valais canton, said during a press conference. “There are videos that have been analysed, there are several people who have been interviewed and reports have been made.”Pilloud said the investigation was looking at acoustic foam pictured on the ceiling to see whether it complied with regulations and whether it spread the fire.The Valais police chief, Frédéric Gisler, said that of the 119 people injured, 113 had been formally identified. Among the injured are 71 Swiss, 14 French citizens, 11 Italians, four Serbs, as well as one individual each from Bosnia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal. The nationalities of 14 of the injured have not yet been confirmed.Officials said identifying the dead and the remaining injured could take days owing to their burns.One thing most of the victims appear to have in common is how desperately young they were. An account on Instagram has filled up with photos of the youthful faces of those who remain unaccounted for, with their friends and relatives desperately seeking information about their whereabouts.View image in fullscreenLaetitia Brodard-Sitre displays her social media post about her 16-year-old son Arthur.Photograph: Noemie Olive/ReutersA 16-year-old Swiss national, Arthur Brodard, was reported missing by his mother, Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, who appealed for information on social media and to the Swiss newspaper Le Temps. She said she and his father had looked in hospitals in Lausanne and Berne but could not find him.The grandfather of a 22-year-old French woman, Emilie Pralong, told BFMTV she was thought to have been at Le Constellation with several friends and described an “agonising” wait for information.Hospital workers in Berne have advised those who know the missing to inform the authorities of any tattoos or types of jewellery they may have been wearing.Ludovico, whose parents have a holiday home in Crans-Montana, was among a group of five friends who had driven to the resort from Rome. They had spent Tuesday night in the bar and planned to go again after seeing in the new year elsewhere. “We were on our way when we saw people running away screaming, and flames behind them,” he said. “We are so, so lucky.”Ludovico often goes to nightclubs in Rome and said it was common to see candles put on the top of champagne bottles, to celebrate birthdays or other occasions. “The difference in those places is that the ceilings are much higher,” he said.View image in fullscreenLe Constellation was known as an affordable place to party in a resort popular with celebrities and wealthy skiers.Photograph: Marco Alpozzi/LaPresse/ShutterstockA collective grief could be felt in Crans-Montana on Friday where residents, many of whom knew victims, have been stunned by the disaster.“I’m still trying to digest it,” said Jacques, who was born in Crans, as he drank coffee with his friend in a bar. “It’s the grief, as if we have all lost a loved one.”Many had fond memories of Le Constellation. Dalia Gubbay, a school council member in Milan for schools of the Jewish community, said: “I’ve had a holiday home here for more than 30 years and used to go there to play with the pinball machine.”Gubbay, a mother of six, said her son, 27, and his wife celebrated the new year in an apartment behind the bar and as they walked home they saw people leaving the venue crying, some with burns. “But at that point they didn’t understand the gravity of it. We initially thought it was another attack against the Jewish community but this was completely ruled out.”Two of her other children, aged 15 and 17, had planned to celebrate New Year’s Eve in Crans-Montana before deciding to go to Florence. “When they got back last night, I cried and hugged them hard,” she said. “If they’d stayed, they might have gone to the party in Le Constellation. What has happened is unthinkable.”Explore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

At the time,76% of people backed the move.Fast-forward to November 2025, and an equivalent poll foundtwo-thirds of people thought Begum should not be allowed back to the UK.In policy terms, therefore, responding tothe European court of human rights’ intervention in the mattershould be a no-brainer for the Home Office. This week, media briefings suggested Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, would “robustly” push back against the court after it questioned whether the UK should have considered if Begum – who left the country aged 15 – had been trafficked before it left her stateless in a Syrian camp.It is not, however, a subject that ministers can simply ignore, for two reasons in particular.The first is that Begum is not alone. In November,a report into counter-terrorismby a commission of senior UK lawyers said the government’s refusal to repatriate most of the several dozen Britons still living in camps for former IS members and their families was becoming “untenable”.It said that between 55 and 72 people with links to the UK remain in the camps, among them about 30 to 40 children, living in “inhuman” and often dangerous conditions, and added that other countries have already taken action on the issue.Who is Shamima Begum and what are her prospects of returning to UK?Read moreThe second reason – for all that Mahmood might dismiss it – is that the human rights court might have a point.Even if one was to argue that the 15-year-old Begum was old enough to understand the implications of seeking out a self-styled global caliphate that has carried outnumerous and atrocious rights abuses, the UK has never sought to hold her to account.Nor has it sought to take responsibility for the actions of someone who, when she left the UK, was entirely a product of her home country.Begum’s case also highlights another political quandary, which is not currently high on the list of voters’ concerns, but has potentially huge repercussions: what does it mean for the rights of Britons who have migrant heritage?Ministers were able to strip Begum of her UK citizenship only because they said she was entitled to Bangladeshi nationality through her parents.Bangladesh, however, has rejected this. Citizenship cannot be revoked if it leaves someone stateless, meaning Begum’s fate would have been impossible for an equivalent Briton without an overseas background.The bar for losing UK nationality is set high. It can only happen if citizenship was acquired fraudulently, or if removing it is “conducive to the public good”.Home Office guidancespecifies this as meaning the affected person is connected to serious organised crime, terrorism or war crimes.It is for these reasons that the Home Office concludedit could not revoke the citizenship of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the British-Egyptian activist who was granted the status while in prison in Egypt in 2021, owing to his mother’s birth in the UK. He came to Britain on Boxing Day, despite the emergence of social media posts including one in which he talked about the need to kill “colonialists” and “Zionists”.Nonetheless, both the Conservatives and Reform UK have argued for Abd el-Fattah to be deported and to lose his UK citizenship, indicating that a future government might use the sanction more widely against dual nationals, or those from migrant backgrounds, even if they have not necessarily broken the law.What did Alaa Abd el-Fattah say in past social media posts and why is there a backlash?Read moreThe dispute ties into wider arguments about migration – an area where Keir Starmer’s government has faced accusations of trying too hard to placate voters tempted by Reform, at the cost of losing potential voters on the other side of the political divide to the Liberal Democrats and Greens.Robert Ford, a professor of political science at Manchester University, said it was possible for ministers to make a wider argument about the importance of citizenship as a right, should they want to tackle the issue head on.“If the government wanted to reverse the Shamima Begum case, they should do so on the grounds that if [British] citizenship is not a safe status for her; it’s not a safe status for anyone,” he said. “Would you like it if Nigel Farage revoked your citizenship because Israel grants your citizenship, or because you have Irish grandparents?“Citizenship is an unrestricted, unrevokable, irreversible right and status, or it is nothing, that is how you would argue for it.”However, Ford added that, while this was a plausible general argument to make, the example of Begum was unlikely to be the best way to advance it.“I say this as someone who thinks the government has erred a great deal by not adopting principled positions and [by] chasing the polling too much, but even with that in mind, the Shamima Begum case is a difficult one,” he said.“It will never be a popular thing to do because, although one can frame the issue as one of trafficking, this is somebody leaving the country to go and join IS, which is never going to be a popular cause.”Explore more on these topicsShamima BegumHuman rightsEuropean court of human rightsBritish identity and societyIslamic StateUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now he’s hoping for success at May’s local elections – by taking a page from Nigel Farage’s playbookFri 2 Jan 2026 09.30 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 13.46 ESTShareZack Polanski finally decided to stand as the Greens’ leader, he says, after witnessing the party being eclipsed by Reform in last May’s local elections across England, and realising that British politics had changed for good.While the Greens made yet more steady gains, Reform won nearly 700 councillors from a standing start. As deputy leader, it was Polanski’s job to speak to losing candidates to both offer consolation and ask what lessons could be learned.“The ground game was as solid and as effective as it could be,” he told the Guardian. “Where they felt we were missing was in the national conversation. Reform was this new beast that had clearly dominated the air game. I realised we needed to match that.”Soon after the local elections, Polanski announced his candidacy, promising to shake up the party with a Reform-like dose of what he called “eco-populism”, a phrase he made up on the spotin an interviewlaunching the campaign and which became its unofficial slogan.Four months after he became leader, membership of the Greens in England and Wales has shot up from about 70,000 to well over 180,000, and poll ratings have risen such that a handful have shown the Greens above the Liberal Democrats and even Labour.This is uncharted territory for a party that had specialised in the patient long game, building up networks of councillors before challenging for parliamentary seats.Green party reaches 100,000 members for first time after Polanski becomes leaderRead moreEven senior Green members who were sceptical about his candidacy now credit Polanski for boosting the party’s profile – as well as his own.A year ago, Polanski was a member of the London assembly who was barely known outside the party despite being its deputy leader. But since trouncing two of the party’s MPs, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns, in the leadership contest, he is everywhere; on the airwaves and on social media. He also has his own podcast that he says has a million listens a month.Even sitting at the very back of a cafe in north-east London, Polanski is recognised. If he walks in the area on his own, “within about 30 seconds someone will come and lobby me about something”, he says.Polanski appreciates that such approaches are to be welcomed, particularly for a party which has traditionally struggled to get attention.Amid all his other tasks as leader, he tries to spend an hour every day replying to people who message him on social media. Why? Because many of them are new supporters, who then eagerly share his reply with family and friends, setting off, he hopes, a domino effect of enthusiasm and activism.“I’ve gone around the country and bumped into people where that was the beginning of their journey, and who now have an important role in their local party,” he says. “And it started with that first engagement.”View image in fullscreenPolanski appreciates his personal importance to the party’s transformation.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianRising membership numbers are mainly a source of bragging rights for other parties, but for the perennially cash-strapped Greens it has brought a welcome surge of income. This has been supplemented by crowdfunders, withone Christmas-themed videothat Polanski fronted raising £260,000.Green party’s new leader Zack Polanski rules out any Starmer pact and attacks ‘charlatan’ FarageRead moreIt is all relatively small-time in a world where Reform can receive £9m from a single wealthy donor, but Polanski says it is an advantage.“We really require that membership surge for funding, because the vast, vast majority of our finances come from regular donations from members,” he says. “That’s an important principle, because that frees you up to never have a vested interest, never have someone that you’re beholden to.”It is allowing the party to recruit more staff, with a planned increase of nearly 80% in paid personnel this year including a senior communications aide for Polanski, who writes all his social media posts as well as replying to messages. “It’s been really bad for my reading life,” he says.The next 12 months will bring two significant challenges, one shorter term, the other more structural. The first involves May’s local elections in England and for the Senedd in Wales, while the Scottish Greens fight their own campaign for Holyrood.Polanski’s arm of the party is forecast to make large gains in London. It has never before held a Senedd seat, but polls suggest a tally of up to three, potentially giving the Greens the balance of power.At the same time, the party has to finesse a programme for the next general election, one that will not only attract much more scrutiny than ever before, but that will be drawn up without the big parties’ retinue of thinktanks and other policy specialists.“Increasingly, experts in all fields are offering their services or advice, and that’s something I do want to lean into, not just for me, but for the party more generally,” Polanski says.“People rightly want to know, beyond the principles, what do these practical policies look like and how we pay for them? I think they’re all legitimate questions. I think it’s also a legitimate answer that we’re three or four years away from a general election.”Would he do it all again? Polanski says he has no regrets.“It’s been amazing. When I was first elected as leader, Sadiq Khan [the London mayor] said he had not seen a politician enjoy a campaign quite so much. And I think that’s continued.“There are definitely days that are less enjoyable than others, particularly personal attacks on my loved ones or my family, but actually, 99% of the time, it’s the most privileged, wonderful position to be in, and I’m loving every second.”Explore more on these topicsZack PolanskiGreen partyGreen politicsLocal electionsLocal politicsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

From this region – one of the country’s poorest and most dangerous – the hotel is attempting to carve another path for Hela province, which has long been beset by tribal fighting.Despite a history of conflict in the area, the hotel has welcomed tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world, and the country’s leaders want to attract even more tourists to this hard-to-access location.In December, Papua New Guinea’s prime minister, James Marape, visited Ambua Lodge to highlight its four decades of “safe and successful investment” in the area.“I encourage other Papua New Guineans and potential investors, both local and international, not to be discouraged by negativity,” Marape said.Jayesh Naduvil from Trans Niugini Tours, which runs Ambua Lodge, says tensions and conflict in the region have not presented problems for visitors, many of whom come for theHuli Wigmen, birdwatching and nature trails. The lodge is made up of thatched-roof rooms overlooking lush valleys.“None of our clients ever had any law and order issues, as all our drivers, guides are from the community and are usually aware if there are any issues and avoid the areas,” Naduvil says.View image in fullscreenThatched-roof round house rooms at Ambua Lodge, Papua New Guinea.Photograph: supplied/Trans Niugini Tours, Papua New GuineaTribal fighting is not unusual in parts of PNG, but in recent years conflict in the highlands region –including in EngaandHela provinces– has become more deadly as more sophisticated weapons have become available.Trans Niugini also operates Rondon Ridge in the Western province of the highlands, a luxury hotel with connections to the local Melpa tribe. The tribe remains deeply connected to the land and cultures practised for thousands of years, but in more recent years have also embraced business. Naduvil says the Melpa tribe had seen the benefits of tourism in other places and “wanted us to build a tourist lodge in the area”.The industry is growing. Figures from the Pacific Tourism Organisation show a 9.3% increase in international visitors to PNG in the first half of 2025. Most people come from Australia, at 39%, followed by Asia, at 35%. Tourism minister Belden Namah told parliament in December the industry is a “sleeping giant” with deep potential. Namah says more funding is needed to grow the sector, and has described tourism as a “pot of gold that remains unexplored”.View image in fullscreenRondon Ridge worker feeds birds in Papua New Guinea.Photograph: PNGtours.com‘Authentic’ culture and adventureAbout 250km east of Hela province is another of PNG’s attractions – the country’s highest peak, Mount Wilhelm. This part of PNG’s highlands region is closer to the coast, and while tribal fighting is not as significant, it grapples with violence and crime.Here lies a hotel in picturesque surroundings, known as Betty’s Place. The hotel is a resting spot for people seeking to take on Mt Wilhelm, and the hotel is one of several tourist operations that offer adventure and authentic cultural experiences, boosting the local economy.In the late 1980s, Betty and her Australian husband, Kenneth Higgins, bought land to settle and grow vegetables. For years they lived on the property with daughter Ruth, and in the mid-1990s a group of mountain climbers stopped by looking for a place to stay. Betty took them in and over time the place evolved into a hotel.Turning it into tourist accommodation had plenty of challenges – there was no water supply, no electricity and no roads. But two decades later it is a hub for people who visit to climb Mt Wilhelm.“We run generators and have wifi through a [satellite]. We do have solar, but it only powers LED lights – we cannot get the technology to sustain our operations in solar alone,” says Ruth, who now runs the hotel.Here, visitors experience Melanesian culture deeply rooted in the people and spirits of the land.“We promote authentic culture … the culture we still practice today. We have high altitude orchids, bird species endemic to our area,” Ruth says.View image in fullscreenBetty’s Place, in Chimbu province, Papua New Guinea.Photograph: Betty’s PlaceTourists have visited from all over the world. Among them is Robert Mads Anderson, who visited from the US in July, and described the lodge as a “magical place in the midst of a whole lot of wilderness”.“Exceptionally warm and welcoming atmosphere, fresh food and local trout in a phenomenal setting,” Anderson said.Higgins says law and order in the small village where Betty’s Place is located is not an issue, and in addition local residents can earn good money working as tourist guides.Still, she calls on PNG authorities to provide more support for the industry to deal with its challenges such as simply keeping the lights on and the water flowing for visitors.Ruth says she is pushing for people “to see the benefits of tourism … and the importance of keeping what we have as pristine as possible. We are so passionate about it.”Explore more on these topicsPapua New GuineaPacific islandsAsia PacificfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Neither will film-makers attempting to add their own twist, understandable given how repetitive the die, wake up, lumber, bite and repeat formula has become. Australian director Zak Hilditch’s attempt, the rather buried We Bury the Dead, is therefore not quite as striking as it might have seemed a decade and change ago. Using words such as “contemplative” and “mournful” to describe a film that includes its fair share of gnarly head-smashing has become something of a cliche, so much so that last month’smeta-comedy Anaconda reboothad its characters joke that these days, even a film about a giant snake needs “intergenerational trauma” to work.But Hilditch mercifully avoids drowning his film in drab self-seriousness. Yes, it’s a zombie survival thriller that’s also about grief – but it’s also just a zombie survival thriller, albeit one with less carnage than some might expect. Those gearing up for gore would be forgiven for expecting such given the film’s cursed 2 January release date, typically handed over to the silliest of studio horror, from One Missed Call to Texas Chainsaw 3D to Season of the Witch (they’ll likely be satiated by next week’s killer chimp schlocker Primate instead). We Bury the Dead, which was partly funded by the Adelaide film festival before premiering at SXSW, is less focused on death toll and more on the toll left on those who’ve lost someone, in this iteration as the result of a US government blunder.Song Sung Blue review – Neil Diamond tribute act gets sweet treat of movie thanks to Jackman and HudsonRead moreIn a turn of events that doesn’t seem awfully far-fetched given the clown show that is Trump’s military, a catastrophic accident involving a weapon of mass destruction kills around half a million people in Tasmania. One of those was the travelling husband of Ava (Daisy Ridley), who has now flown over to join a team of volunteers to help with body retrieval, going inside the homes of the dead and helping with identification and cataloguing. But she’s really hoping to break away from the pack and find his body, left in an area that’s out of bounds with fires still raging. Her presence isn’t all that popular given how many Australians still blame the Americans (Ridley’s accent takes a while to even out) but she finds a friend in brusque rule-breaker Clay (Brenton Thwaites), who agrees to go with her into uncharted territory. Oh and there’s a slight hitch: some of the dead have started to wake up …It’s unclear why this is happening or why certain corpses start twitching while others remain still which might explain why there’s a remarkable lack of fear on display. The undead are treated more like a curiosity, as if no one in this universe has ever seen a zombie film, and it’s only when “agitation” occurs during the later stages of the transformation that anyone starts to run and grab something pointy. Instead, Ridley’s Ava is more focused on the awfulness of what she has lost, her big eyes always on the verge of tears, and whether finding her husband’s body will help bring any sort of closure. What if he’s awake? Would that be better or worse?After her Star Wars duties ended, it was perhaps for the best that Ridley’s by-the-book attempt to be a multiplex mainstay didn’t work out all that well. She stumbled away from cursed YA messChaos Walkingand has found more joy in smaller fare instead. She was wonderfully specific in her portrayal of an anxious office worker in the otherwise so-what Sundance comedySometimes I Think About Dyingand effectively unsettled in 2024’s little-seen Brit thrillerMagpie(a film with a brilliantly wicked final twist) and now she’s great on a smaller canvas once again. She gives real emotional depth to a slightly underwritten protagonist, navigating a frightening world while processing a terrifying truth – that the person she gave her life to is never coming back. She’s as effectively forceful with her physicality while things worsen as she is with conveying the gnawing horror of grief, a character light on dialogue that relies on Ridley’s impressively modulated facial reactions.New year, old warnings: what can films set in 2026 teach us?Read moreShe works hard to involve us in her quest, although our interest starts to flag a little in the final act. Hilditch, who gave us one good Netflix horror (1922) and one genuinely terrible one (Rattlesnake), is more confident with visuals, capturing the beauty of the natural landscape with some genuinely incredible shots and stretching his budget to make a small film often seem huge, than he is with tone. There are some switch-ups that work (there’s a sequence involving a grieving soldier and an unusual dance that neatly slides from sadness to suspense) but too many that don’t, quiet moments of reflection followed by big needle drop-soundtracked scenes of “fun” or familiarly middling zombie action.As Ava’s journey comes to an end, we realise there’s not much here that’s all that new when it comes to the walking dead and how humans would really process their existence (a fact made clearer by an underwhelming finale that asks a question already posed by last year’s28 Years Later). But in a genre plagued by a lack of effort, I’ll take a solid try.We Bury the Dead is out now in cinemas in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and will be released on 5 February in AustraliaExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsDaisy RidleyZombiesDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

For a casual tourist, that adds to the mystique. For time-pressed islanders, care workers and businesses, it adds delays, stress and costs.Those two ferries over Bluemull and Yell Sound convert a 34-mile drive from Priest’s home at Baltasound on Unst, the most northerly of Shetland’s islands, to Sullom Voe on Shetland’s main island, into a 3.5 hour round trip. He works 12-hour shifts at the terminal.Alec Priest says the ferries for his commute are ‘a colossal waste of time’.Photograph: Shetland News“It’s a colossal waste of time,” he said. “During the winter, if you have any gales, there’s a good chance the ferries will stop. It does make you cautious.”Cutting tunnels between Yell and Unst and Shetland’s Mainland would shrink that journey dramatically to perhaps 40 minutes each way. Instead, Priest stays in staff hostels at Sullom Voe, so is away from home for weeks at a time. “It’s a shame for my family, but it’s the only option,” he said.Priest is part of a very energetic campaign by islanders on Yell and Unstto promote tunnels. In 2025 they commissioned and funded geological surveys – and retained advisers steeped in Scandinavian tunnel engineering – in a bid to prove their economic, social and financial value.The social cost of not having the tunnels is significant, campaigners argue, because it drives depopulation and isolation. Priest’s sister left Yell for Shetland’s Mainland with her family to avoid the insecurity of relying on ferries. School rolls on Yell fluctuate as families arrive and leave again, he said.They point to the Faroes, to the north of Shetland, where road tunnels connect numerous islands, including the world’s only underground roundabout – the brightly lit Eysturoyartunnilin. Shetlanders also look enviously at Norway, where islands have been linked to the mainland for decades.Their campaign, backed by their Liberal Democrat MP, Alistair Carmichael, is credited with forcing tunnels and bridges firmly on to the political agenda. Scottish ministers have included fixed links in their strategic transport plan and gave Shetland £10m to investigate connectivity options ranging from ferry replacement, to flights to tunnelling.View image in fullscreenCampaigners say tunnels between Yell and Unst to Shetland’s Mainland would dramatically cut journey times.Photograph: geogphotos/AlamyA government spokesperson hinted that further commitments could emerge with the publication of an updated infrastructure strategy, alongside the publication of the Scottish budget in January.“Inter-island connectivity, including funding, has been a focus of discussion at the Orkney and Shetland ferry replacement task forces since early 2023, and we will continue to work in partnership with local authorities,” they said.Officials in the Western Isles are also pressing their case to complete what they describe as a continuous “spinal link” connecting their sinuous chain of islands, with bridges or tunnels to connect south Harris with north Uist, and south Uist with Barra.A map showing the proposed links between Scottish islandsAs the crow flies, Leverburgh in south Harris is about five miles from north Uist; getting there by ferry takes up to 80 minutes as it weaves for nine nautical miles (10 statute miles) between a dozen tiny islands to Berneray.But there are disputes about the merits of cutting tunnels or building longer bridges. Orkney is focusing on replacing its ageing ferry fleet, battling with Scottish ministers reluctant to pay for them given Orkney’s ferries are council-owned and council-run.Torcuil Crichton, the Labour MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) argues that tunnels or new bridges in his constituency are a costly “fantasy solution” that would take too long to deliver. The islands need new ferries now, and far more money invested in social and health services.“The quickest way to connect the islands is to fund some ferries,” he said. “It’s political energy being expended on a long-term solution when we face a connectivity emergency now.”Carmichael believes the concept will be immensely appealing; the islands in Shetland connected to Mainland by causeways have no problems with depopulation, he said. “I have always said the most difficult tunnel to be built would be the first one. Once you’ve proven the concept, you won’t have to make the case [for others]. Communities will be banging on your door.”View image in fullscreenAlice Mathewson says tunnels would increase the islands’ resilience.Photograph: Shetland NewsAlice Mathewson, the development manager for North Yell Development council, whose home is on Unst, said tunnels would greatly increase the islands’ resilience. Ferry crews fall sick and ferries break down. She and Priest estimate the two tunnels could cost between £115m and £135m to build; replacing Shetland’s ferries would cost £100m on top of their £7m a year in subsidies.Tunnels can carry and protect vital internet and electricity connections – its subsea phone lines have been accidentally cut several times recently – and ensure Shetland’s salmon farms can get their produce to market. Islanders would be happy to pay tolls to fund the cost of tunnels and embrace public-private financing, she said.“The ferry service has served our islands very well but that’s a 20th-century form of transport,” she said. “In the 21st century the answer is: dig a hole.Scotlandhas to drag itself into the 21st century.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandInfrastructureTransportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Eye bags get darker after sleepless nights and pimples appear in protest at the first signs of stress. Whatever the cause, the best concealers can help to even out imperfections, so you look flawless regardless of what is going on behind the scenes.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It might seem obvious, but not all concealers are the same. Some leave a cakey finish on the skin, while others settle quickly into fine lines or blend out and leave barely any coverage at all. Many modern concealers also include active skincare ingredients to combine the benefits of both products.I tested a huge variety of concealers for consideration here, including cult-favourite viral products and new formulas arriving to shake up the makeup game. Below, you’ll find the very best concealers from my testing, with options to suit every skin type, coverage preference and budget.Scroll further to find advice from professional makeup artists on how and when to apply concealer, as well as how to prolong its wear.At a glanceBest concealer overall:Nars Radiant Creamy concealer£29.50 at LookfantasticBest budget concealer:Collection Lasting Perfection concealer£2.25 at AmazonBest concealer for dark circles:Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Radiant concealer£28 at John LewisBest concealer for dry skin:By Terry hyaluronic serum concealer£39 at Cult BeautyBest lightweight concealer:NYX Bare With Me Serum concealer£6.51 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’ve spent the past four years testing and writing about beauty products, makeup included. In that time, I’ve come across bestsellers that fully deserve the hype, but also a fair share of concealers that crease immediately or cling to every dry patch on my face.I’m not a professional makeup artist, but I’ve been wearing makeup since my early teenage years. Because I don’t use fancy blending techniques, my tests show exactly how user-friendly each product is. If I ended up with a creasy, cakey mess under my eyes, chances are you might too.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur makeup expert applies concealer to her face during testing.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianThere are three main areas to consider when testing concealer: coverage, creasing and the range of shades available. Before I sourced any concealers, I checked the available shade ranges and wouldn’t touch a formulation if it didn’t cater to a wide range of skin tones. Considering this has been a widely publicised issue for a decade or more, I was amazed by how many brands still hadn’t caught up.View image in fullscreenSharpie dots were used to test each concealer’s coverage.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianThe next thing I tested was coverage, for each of the 13 concealers I tested. Rather than guess how well each concealer covered up my ever-changing spots and dark circles, I judged this by using a red Sharpie to make small spots on my forearm. Once the spots had dried, I covered each with a small amount of concealer and lightly blended them with a small fluffy brush. This showed me how well each concealer could cover imperfections.The last and perhaps most important step was a wear test. This involved wearing each concealer for a full day and monitoring how well it covered spots and dark circles. Whenever a concealer settled into fine lines, it was marked down as being unsuitable for the eye area. I assessed how easy to blend each product was too, and noted any dryness, irritation or patchiness as the day went on.The best concealers for 2026View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest concealer overall:Nars Radiant Creamy concealerNarsRadiant Creamy concealerfrom£29.50£29.50 at Lookfantastic£29.50 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveIts impressive shade range and long-wearing, comfortable coverageWhat we don’t loveIt’s not hydrating and is expensive per mlPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£29.50 at Lookfantastic£29.50 at Cult BeautyThis is one of the most revered concealers on the market – and for good reason. It’s creamy, buildable and lasts all day without budging or settling into fine lines. It’s my top recommendation for anyone looking for a foolproof formula.Why we love itWhile it’s fairly pricey, a little goes a long way with this formula. In my experience, a light layer worked hard to conceal dark circles and angry-looking spots alike. Applied in light layers, it’s also buildable, meaning you can get high coverage from this concealer if you need to.Once blended into the skin, the concealer is almost imperceptible, especially if you find a perfect shade match from its 30-strong shade range. I also found it to be long-wearing and resistant to creasing.Unlike other creamy concealers, this formula isn’t hydrating, which means it’s better at keeping excess oiliness at bay. I didn’t find it remotely drying either, so it’s great if you’re looking for something to use on oilier skin without adding shine.It’s a shame that …it’s expensive, but you need only a tiny amount of product for a big impact. If you have very dry skin, though, other formulations provide better hydration.Size:6mlPrice/ml:£4.92Coverage:mediumApplicator type:doe-footShades available:30(find your shade)NarsRadiant Creamy concealerfrom£29.50£29.50 at Lookfantastic£29.50 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveIts impressive shade range and long-wearing, comfortable coverageWhat we don’t loveIt’s not hydrating and is expensive per mlBest budget concealer:Collection Lasting Perfection concealerCollectionLasting Perfection concealerfrom£2.25£4.49 at Boots£2.25 at AmazonWhat we loveIts buildable, long-wearing coverage and soft applicatorWhat we don’t loveIt needs to be blended quicklyPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£4.49 at Boots£2.25 at AmazonAs an affordable-makeup fanatic, this concealer has been a staple in my collection for as long as I can remember. It’s super cheap, has a great shade range, and is a brilliant all-rounder for disguising all kinds of imperfections.Why we love itThis concealer gives a smooth, matt finish, which is perfect for brightening up the area under the eyes. If you’re concealing spots, the formulation lasts really well on oily and combination skin, and I found it offered buildable coverage when gently blended.Since it’s so affordable, you can easily justify buying two different shades – one for a perfect skin match and a brighter shade for use under your eyes. Although the packaging has changed in recent years, it’s still the same hard-working formula. In fact, I prefer the new softer, larger applicator, since it allows for faster, more comfortable application.It’s a shame that …it needs to be blended out quickly, or it’ll settle in the place you applied it – a lesson I learned when I got distracted from my makeup one morning and ended up with stubborn splodges under my eyes.Size:4mlPrice/ml:from 56pCoverage:mediumApplicator type:doe-footShades available:20(find your shade)CollectionLasting Perfection concealerfrom£2.25£4.49 at Boots£2.25 at AmazonWhat we loveIts buildable, long-wearing coverage and soft applicatorWhat we don’t loveIt needs to be blended quicklyBest concealer for dark circles:Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Radiant concealerCharlotte TilburyBeautiful Skin Radiant concealerfrom£28£28 at John Lewis£28 at SpaceNKWhat we loveIts brightening performance and hydrating feelWhat we don’t loveIt’s pricey per mlPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£28 at John Lewis£28 at SpaceNKTackling dark circles requires you to look after your skin, not just bury it beneath concealer. The Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Radiant concealer succeeds on both these fronts, combining comfortable coverage with hydrating, plumping and brightening skincare ingredients.Why we love itIf you’re wearing makeup anyway, why not invest in a multitasker? Packed into this concealer, you’ll find hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and vitamin C. These ingredients work to hydrate, soothe, plump and brighten the skin under the eyes in a product that offers medium coverage.In my tests, I found the concealer both buildable and easy to blend around the eye area. It didn’t settle into any of my fine lines, even when I really challenged it by squinting immediately after application. Better still, it left my skin with a natural-looking glow, without any dry, cakey-looking patches. Thanks to its large doe-foot applicator and blendable consistency, it’s perfect for busy mornings when you’re hoping to quickly achieve a lasting, radiant finish.It’s a shame that …it’s quite expensive, and those with very sensitive, acne-prone skin may find the vitamin C causes breakouts when used to conceal spots.Size:7.2mlPrice per ml:£3.89Coverage:mediumApplicator type:doe-footShades available:30(find your shade)Charlotte TilburyBeautiful Skin Radiant concealerfrom£28£28 at John Lewis£28 at SpaceNKWhat we loveIts brightening performance and hydrating feelWhat we don’t loveIt’s pricey per mlBest concealer for dry skin:By Terry hyaluronic serum concealerBy TerryHyaluronic serum concealerfrom£39£39 at John Lewis£39 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveIts hydrating formula with a flawless natural finishWhat we don’t loveIt’s incredibly expensive; smaller shade rangePhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£39 at John Lewis£39 at Cult BeautyIf you’re tired of drying concealers that cling to patches of skin, the By Terry hyaluronic serum concealer will be transformative. Its hydrating ingredients and lightweight, buildable texture make it a great option for dry, mature skin and for use under the eyes.Why we love itBy Terry has packed eight different types of hyaluronic acid – a humectant that draws moisture into the skin – into this formulation. It uses three molecular weights to help plump and moisturise different layers of the skin, meaning the product won’t dry out or go patchy in a day’s wear.This rang true in my tests, with a light amount of concealer effectively minimising blemishes and brightening dark circles to create a natural-looking finish. You’ll also find caffeine and magnolia flower to help brighten and soothe the skin, making this great for stimulating healing in dry and irritated skin.It’s a shame that …it’s the most expensive concealer I’ve ever used – I’m almost annoyed at how nice it is to use for that reason. That said, the shade range isn’t as extensive as others, and if you want high coverage, this isn’t the concealer for you.Size:5.2mlPrice/ml:£7.50coverage:light to mediumapplicator type:doe-footshades available:12(find your shade)By TerryHyaluronic serum concealerfrom£39£39 at John Lewis£39 at Cult BeautyWhat we loveIts hydrating formula with a flawless natural finishWhat we don’t loveIt’s incredibly expensive; smaller shade rangeBest lightweight concealer:NYX Bare With Me Serum concealerNYXBare With Me Serum concealerfrom£6.51£11.49 at Lookfantastic£6.51 at AmazonWhat we loveLightweight consistency in a clean pump bottleWhat we don’t loveIts slightly dewy finish isn’t for everyone£11.49 at Lookfantastic£6.51 at AmazonConfession time: I’ve worked my way through at least three tubes of this stuff. I first tried it when I was struggling with a nightmare combination of dry but spot-ridden skin, and pretty much stuck with it as a daily concealer from then onwards. It’s super lightweight and leaves the skin looking fresh, healthy and dewy.Why we love itWhen you have redness and uneven skin texture, it can be tempting to reach for heavier, full-coverage formulations. However, something with a serum-like consistency, like this product, can gently blur rough texture and disguise redness without exaggerating it or looking cakey. In my years of using this concealer, it’s never settled into any fine lines.Better still, it dispenses from a small pump, which means the formulation stays completely free from bacteria and dirt, unlike concealers with a doe-foot that comes in contact with the skin. I have acne-prone skin, so I much prefer this design.It’s a shame that …with a full press, the pump dispenses far more product than I typically use. This is easily rectified by only using a half press, though. It also has a slightly dewy finish, which isn’t for everyone.Size:9.6mlPrice per ml:from 68pcoverage:lightapplicator type:pumpshades available:13(find your shade)NYXBare With Me Serum concealerfrom£6.51£11.49 at Lookfantastic£6.51 at AmazonWhat we loveLightweight consistency in a clean pump bottleWhat we don’t loveIts slightly dewy finish isn’t for everyoneThe best of the restMac Studio Fix concealerMacStudio Fix concealerfrom£25£25 at Lookfantastic£25 at BootsWhat we loveFast full coverage without settlingWhat we don’t loveIts paint-like smell£25 at Lookfantastic£25 at BootsBest for:full coverageThe Mac Studio Fix range is best known for its long-wearing soft matt foundation. This concealer is the foundation’s sister product, and it performed very well in my tests. It lasted all day without budging or smudging, even during a heatwave.Of all the concealers here, this one offers the fullest coverage, making it perfect for covering stubborn blemishes and dark spots. Still, despite its thicker formulation, it didn’t settle into any of my fine lines. Used with a light touch, it’s a good option for those who prefer a little extra coverage.It didn’t make the final cut because …it has an odd paint-like smell – the same smell as the Studio Fix foundation I used to wear in my late teens. I welcomed the nostalgia hit, but anyone hoping to avoid strong chemical scents may want to avoid.Size:7ml;price/ml:£3.57;coverage:high;applicator type:doe-foot;shades available:34(find your shade)MacStudio Fix concealerfrom£25£25 at Lookfantastic£25 at BootsWhat we loveFast full coverage without settlingWhat we don’t loveIts paint-like smellLaura Mercier real flawless concealerLaura MercierReal flawless concealerfrom£28.50£28.50 at Lookfantastic£28.50 at SpaceNKWhat we loveSoft matt, natural finishWhat we don’t loveIt doesn’t stand out from the crowd£28.50 at Lookfantastic£28.50 at SpaceNKBest for:blurring imperfectionsThis concealer has a gorgeous, lightweight consistency that’s both easy to blend over larger areas and does a great job of hiding spots. It’s one of the more subtle concealers on this page, since its soft matt finish mirrors the appearance of natural skin. It’s also serum-infused, which helps to even skin tone and smooth imperfections.I found this concealer’s curved doe-foot applicator wide enough to apply liberally under my eyes, while providing a good amount of precision when concealing spots. It also lasted beautifully, without pilling or going patchy over the course of a day – a testament to its claim of 16-hour wear.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s on the pricier side, and it didn’t stand out among the competition – other concealers offered more for a similar price.

It has a lightweight, buildable formula that lasts well on the skin without creasing, caking or settling into fine lines.It’s marketed as a long-wear concealer, and I can confirm it didn’t budge during a long, hot summer day running errands. Like many of its competitors, it’s also infused with hydrating hyaluronic acid and antioxidant vitamin E to soothe the skin. That means it doesn’t become drying, despite being long-lasting.It didn’t make the final cut because …it has a paint-like, chemical smell, and its doe-foot applicator is less fluffy than other concealers, making it less comfortable to apply. You also need to blend out this concealer quickly, otherwise it will settle in place.Size:5ml;price/ml:from £2.60;coverage:medium;applicator type:doe-foot;shades available:18(find your shade)MilaniConceal + Perfect concealerfrom£13£13 at Milani£14.25 at BootsWhat we loveHigh-end performance at an affordable priceWhat we don’t loveHard applicator and paint-like smellWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenOnline shade finders can help you find your ideal concealer.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianHow much should I spend on a concealer?“Concealer sits closely on your skin, often covering spots or sensitive areas, so quality really does matter,” says Jamie Genevieve, makeup artist and founder ofVieve. “It’s worth investing in a formula that performs well, wears comfortably, and treats your skin kindly. But ultimately, choose one that fits your budget and meets your needs.”As you can see in the recommendations above, you can buy a great basic concealer for less than £10. However, if you want to invest in something that uses hydrating skincare ingredients, more innovative applicators or cruelty-free formulations, you may need to spend more.How do I know my concealer shade?This was far simpler in bygone days before online shopping, when pharmacies would stock testers of every concealer to help find your perfect shade. Sadly, in-store product testers have become a dying breed since the pandemic.However, many makeup brands now have their own shade finders online, which use either a phone camera or webcam to give a best guess for your perfect shade. Others will offer a short questionnaire that asks you for details about your skin undertone, texture and shade. Both work well in my experience.It helps to know your skin tone to help choose the right shade – if you have warm-toned skin and the shade finder recommends a cool-toned shade, think twice. For each concealer on this page, I’ve included a link to the shade finder.That said, concealer isn’t a one-trick pony. “Use a shade lighter than your foundation for brightening the undereye area, or a shade that matches your skin tone for seamless coverage elsewhere,” recommends Suzie O’Neill, founder ofAYU Cosmetics.How and when do I apply concealer?“Think of it as layering strategically based on the coverage you want,” says Genevieve. “I usually apply concealer after foundation to brighten and perfect specific areas. But if you’re covering dark spots or pigmentation, you can start with concealer as a base, then follow with foundation to even out everything.”Unlike Genevieve, I apply concealer after my eye makeup to clean up any fallout from the eye shadow I use. Most days, I prefer a lighter makeup look and don’t see the need to use foundation after applying concealer. This is an approach recommended by Karen MacDonald, founder ofBlomma Beauty, “for a barefaced, no-makeup look to let your natural skin shine through”.How do you keep concealer from creasing on older skin?“Prep is everything,” says O’Neill. “Hydrate the undereye area well, apply a nourishing eye cream, and use a light hand – less is more.”I recommend giving any hydrating,anti-ageing skincareandeye creams15 minutes or so to settle into the skin before applying makeup. This should ensure the skincare products don’t mess with the formulation of the concealer, causing it to pill or settle into fine lines.When applying concealer, O’Neill recommends you “tap the concealer in gently and, if needed, set lightly with a touch of translucent powder to stop it from moving”.For more:The best eye creams for banishing bags, puffiness and fine linesThe best mascaras for longer, fuller and fluttery lashesThe best anti-ageing creams, serums and treatments, picked by Sali HughesSarah Matthews is aconsumer journalist who specialises in giving health and beauty recommendations.

On City boys darting around the Square Mile. In Hyde Park, where Arab dads in baggy suits kicked footballs with their children in honeyed light. At school, where cheap grey suits were our uniform. The suit has always been a costume of seriousness that signals powerfulness and performance; all the things I was apparently supposed to want if I ever intended to become a “man”. But until recently, my generation seemed to wear them less and less, and they had all but disappeared from my consciousness.Then came the newly elected New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, who was sworn in at a private ceremony dressed in a sober black overcoat, crisp white shirt and an Eri silk tiefrom New Delhi-based designer Kartik Kumra ofKartik Research– styled by US fashion editor, Gabriella Karefa-Johnson.Buoyed up by an ingenious campaign, he caught the imagination of the world like no other New York mayoral candidate of recent times. But whether he was throwing his hands in the air at ahip-hop clubor at a premiere party for the film Marty Supreme, one thing on his campaign trail rarely changed: he was almost always in a suit. Loosely tailored, modern with soft shoulders, yet conventional and ordinary, his is a typically middle-class millennial suit – well, as typical as it can be for a generation that rarely bothers to wear one.View image in fullscreenMamdani at the Marty Supreme premiere afterparty with Odessa A’zion, one of the film’s stars, on 16 December 2025.Photograph: John Nacion/Variety/Getty Images“The suit is in this weird position,” says men’s fashion writer Derek Guy (AKA Twitter’s“the menswear guy”) over the phone from California. “It’s been dying a slow death since the end of the second world war,” with the real dip arriving in the 1990s with “the rise of business casual”.“It’s basically only worn in the most formal locations: weddings, funerals, to some extent, court appearances,” Guy says. “It’s sort of like the kimono in Japan,” in that it “essentially represents a tradition that has long ceded from daily life.” Many politicians “wear a suit to say: ‘I am a politician, you can trust me. You should vote for me. I have authority.’” But while the suit has historically signalled this, today it performs authority in the hope of winning public confidence. As Guy explains: “Since we’re also living in a liberal democracy, politicians want to seem relatable, because they’re trying to get your votes.” In many ways, a suit is just a subtle form of drag, in that it performs masculinity, authority and even proximity to power. Or at least how politicians are expected to look.In many ways, a suit is just a subtle form of drag in that it performs masculinityGuy’s words stayed with me. On the rare occasions I need a suit – a wedding or formal occasion – I dust off the one I bought from a Tokyo department store (from high-street brand Global Work, which is like Gap) several years ago. When I first picked it up off the rack, it made me feel sophisticated and expensive, but the slim cut now feels passé. I imagine this will be only too familiar for many of us in the diaspora whose parents come from somewhere else, particularly global south countries.View image in fullscreenRichard Gere in American Gigolo (1980).Photograph: Photo 12/AlamyIt’s no surprise the working man’s suit has fallen out of fashion. Like a pair of jeans, a suit’ssilhouette goes through cycles; a particular cut can therefore define an era – and feel quickly outdated. Take now: looser-fitting suits, reminiscent of Richard Gere’s famous Armani one in American Gigolo, might be in vogue, but given the cost, it can feel like a considerable investment for something that’s likely to fall out of fashion within five years. Yet the appeal, at least in some quarters, endures: in the past year, John Lewis says it has seen tailoring sales increase more than 20% as customers “move away from the suit being everyday wear towards an appetite to invest in something special”.Mamdani’s preferred suit is from Suitsupply, a Dutch label that retails in the £400-£1,200 range, placing it firmly in the mid-market bracket. “Mamdani is very much a product of his background,” says Guy. “A relatively young person in his 30s, he’s neither poor nor exceptionally wealthy.” To that end, his mid-level suit will resonate with the demographic most likely to support him: people in their 30s and 40s, college graduates making middle-class incomes, often frustrated by the cost of housing. It’s exactly the kind of suit they might wear themselves. Not cheap but not extravagant, Mamdani’s suits arguably don’t contradict his proposed policies – a rent freeze; building 200,000 permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilised homes; fare-free public buses; and universal early-childhood care.“You could never imagine Donald Trump wearing Suitsupply; he’s a Brioni person,” says Guy, referring to the luxurious Italian suits that Trump wears, which cost from£3,480-£10,600 off the rack: “He’s extremely wealthy and grew up in that New York real-estate world. A power suit fits naturally with that tycoon class, just as more accessible brands fit naturally with Mamdani’s cohort.”View image in fullscreenBarack Obama wearing his ‘shocking’ tan suit, in August 2014.Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesThe history of suits in politics is long and storied: from Obama’s“shocking” tan suit, now infamous enough to have its ownWikipedia page, to Justin Trudeau’s and Emmanuel Macron’s suspiciously polished, tailored sheen, and the “Merkel rainbow” of colourful jackets and slacks worn by the former German chancellor. AsJeremy Corbyn learned, the suit doesn’t just dress the politician; it has the potential to define them.Perhaps the point is what Dr Matthew Sterling Benson-Strohmayer, an economic historian at the London School of Economics, refers to as the “performance of banality”,summoning the suit’s long career as a uniform of political power, with Mamdani’s particular choice tapping into a studied modesty, neither shabby nor showy – “respectability politics” in an inconspicuous suit – to help him appeal to as many voters as possible. But Benson-Strohmayer thinks Mamdani would be aware of the suit’s military and colonial legacy: “The suit isn’t neutral; historians of empire have long noted that its contemporary origins lie in military or colonial administration.” He also sees the suit as a form of protective armour: “I think if you’re Brown, you aren’t going to get taken as seriously in these white spaces.” The suit becomes a way of signalling legitimacy, perhaps especially to those who might question said legitimacy.This kind of sartorial “code-switching” is hardly a new phenomenon. Even Mohandas Gandhi, whose most iconic image was him cross-legged in a hand-spun dhoti with a shawl draped over his shoulder, once donned a three-piece suit as he trained as a young barrister in London. These days, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has started swapping his usual fatigues for a black suit, albeit one without the tie.In every seam and stitch of Mamdani’s public persona, the tension between insider and outsider is visibleThe suit Mamdani chooses, according to David Kuchta, the author of The Three-Piece Suit and Modern Masculinity, is symbolic/significant. “As a Muslim child of immigrants of Indian descent and a democratic socialist, he is under pressure to conform to what many American voters look for as a sign of leadership,” he says, while simultaneously needing to walk a tightrope by “not looking like an elitist selling out his non-mainstream roots and values”.View image in fullscreenMan in black … President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting the Dutch king, Willem-Alexander, in The Hague, on 16 December 2025.Photograph: Robin van Lonkhuijsen/APBut Kuchta is acutely aware of the double standards applied to who wears suits and what is read into it when they do. “That may come in part from Mamdani being a millennial, able to adopt different identities to fit the occasion, but it may also be part of his multicultural background, where code-switching between languages, customs and clothing styles is common,” he says. “White males can remain unnoticed,” but when women and ethnic minorities “attempt to gain the power that suits represent,” they must carefully navigate the codes associated with them.In every seam and stitch of Mamdani’s public persona, the tension between somewhere and nowhere, insider and outsider, is visible. I know well the awkwardness of trying to fit into something not built for me, be it an inherited tradition, or the culture I was born into, or even a suit. What Mamdani’s sartorial choices make clear, however, is that in politics, appearance is never neutral.Explore more on these topicsMen's suitsZohran MamdaniMen's fashionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That does not mean the club’s structure needs a complete overhaulFri 2 Jan 2026 13.21 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 18.42 ESTShareSome clubs build around their manager. Eddie Howe is hugely influential at Newcastle and Aston Villa are pretty much Unai Emery FC these days.Chelsea, though, have adopted an alternative model. They have a team of five sporting directors, led by Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, and do not want one person to hold all the power.Yet the question many are asking in the wake ofEnzo Maresca’s demiseis whether the template will yield success at the very highest level. It is never quiet at Chelsea. They are often busy in the transfer market, meaning there is an element of players coming and going, and they are now looking for their fifth permanent head coach since a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm run by Behdad Eghbali and José E Feliciano, bought the club from Roman Abramovich in 2022.Liam Rosenior opens door to Chelsea job but must wait on BlueCo dealingsRead moreHowever, accusations that the swift unravelling of Maresca’s tenure proves that Chelsea have become unmanageable and lack the stability to compete for the title are over the top. True, they have a young squad and remain short of experience in some key positions. The idea they have failed, though, is not supported by results. It is worth remembering Arsenal had six years away from the Champions League before returning in 2023, whereas Chelsea only had to deal with a two-year hiatus before they regained a spot in Europe’s top club competition.Chelsea are champions of the worldand it is not so long ago that pundits were talking them up as title contenders. The narrative flips quickly. It is premature for the talk to return to chaos after one rotten month, even if Chelsea have dropped to fifth after one league win in seven games and will have their Under-21s coach, Calum McFarlane, in temporary charge when they visit Manchester City on Sunday.There is no panic within the club. Chelsea parting company with Maresca will not change the structure. Chelsea tailored their recruitment to suit Maresca’s stylistic demands. The Italian wanted wingers who could hug the touchline, so he was given Alejandro Garnacho and Pedro Neto. He loved Liam Delap, so thestriker was bought from Ipswich. This was not the work of a dictatorship. The bigger lesson is that Chelsea cannot accept any employee in a leadership position trying to game their way into greater influence.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca was not denied by his employers in the transfer market. He wanted wingers who suited his style and Alejandro Garnacho and Pedro Neto were brought in.Photograph: ZUMA Press Inc/AlamyMaresca changed, not Chelsea. The answer is clear. Sources felt a shift in the Italian’s demeanour after he outwitted Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final last summer. Insiders say Chelsea were unimpressed when Maresca told them a new improved contract would make him halt flirtations with City, Juventus and a third unnamed club. There was shock at the 45-year-old trying to throw his weight around after 18 months in the job.It is supposed to be a partnership between club and head coach; everyone pulling in the same direction. On that note, there is an anecdote that reveals much about Chelsea’s thinking. It concerns Winstanley and Stewart being told that one of the metrics on which their work would be judged was whether they were willing to add high-grade individuals to their team. The challenge was to share responsibility. One of the reasons why Winstanley and Stewart are valued as leaders is because they were not afraid to have Joe Shields, Sam Jewell and Dave Fallows working under them.Maresca was supposed to fit into that structure. But when he talked about his“worst 48 hours”at the club and said he felt a lack of support, it is claimed he was ultimately referring to not being allowed to go against the medical department’s advice on starting certain players. It was not about tactics. Chelsea know it would cross a red line if they were interfering with their manager’s team selection.It is true that Chelsea, who lack a world-class goalkeeper and ruthless striker, look more like a cup team than one capable of challenging for the title. Yet this is a long-term project. Maresca was never under pressure to win the title this season. Chelsea have been building for future challenges. Time will tell if their model is right. It is too soon to be sure.But it is reactive to think thatMaresca’s fallshows it is time to start over. After all, if Chelsea really were unmanageable they would have sacked Maresca when he barely won a league game from January to March last season. Instead, they assessed the data behind performances, concluded he was moving in the right direction and stuck with him.At the same time it is fair to wonder whether Chelsea have placed too much faith in the numbers and have overlooked the unquantifiable marginal gains offered by the very best managers. Those coaches are by their nature demanding, difficult and possess raging egos. They want readymade talent and power. They pay their bosses back by giving their teams inspiration in the defining moments.View image in fullscreenPaul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart believe they did not interfere unfairly with Enzo Maresca’s tenure at Chelsea.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyYet Chelsea see plenty of cases where a manager having full control has ended badly. They will not budge, but they will keep handing out opportunities to young prospects. If it is to be Liam Rosenior then the 41-year-old will be given time to make it work. He is at Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club, and understands the demands.If he joins he will be working with Reece James, Moisés Caicedo, Cole Palmer and Estêvão Willian. There are worse jobs.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The tour he was groomed for. The hidden sub-menace in his one-year central contract offer. Here was a chance to justify the high-wire walk of the last few years, to find an answer, perhaps, to the eternal question: is Zak Crawley actually any good?In the event other things have happened, other warning lights blinked, other elements of England’s collective failure creaked more urgently. Shoaib Bashir, the project spinner, plucked from social media for this tour, is in the 12 for Sydney. He hasn’t taken a wicket in a proper game since July. Good luck babe!Sydney’s tradition of goodbyes coincides with Bazball reckoningRead moreMeanwhile Crawley is preparing to play his 64th Test, 10th on the all-time list for England openers. He averages 31. He averaged 31 at the start of the tour. He looks better than 31. He always looks better than 31. In Australia he has managed to make a pair inthe first Test, but still end up as England’s top scorer heading into the fifth. Albeit on the current tour this is a variation on tallest very small person territory, most enjoyable snicko discussion, most luxuriously high-end TNT sport broadcast segment.Crawley averages 31 in this series too. This is Crawley maths. He will always average 31, feast or famine. It is his destiny to remain unshakably himself. The Crawley identity will always be associated for some with the idea of favour, entitlement, indulgence. But there have been many more selfish England batters than this. A more favourable metric: Crawley has been part of 30 England Test victories, only one behind Michael Atherton but in 52 fewer matches.This time around there has been variation. In Adelaide Crawley batted with restrained resilience for four hours on a fourth-day pitch. In Melbourne he produced a classic Zakball jaunty 37 in thefourth-innings chase, an innings that included the shot of the series, the straight six lifted with an easy grace over long on, the moment the game just slipped away from Australia, a victory that will stand as Bazball’s pyrrhic endgame.In Sydney Crawley is playing at his home from home, a place where he has spent a lot of time, including that rare thing, a record-busting stint in Sydney grade cricket, where the English generally come to suffer, learn, take their licks. A score here would confirm that this has been a good tour for Crawley, that his own run in the Test team will roll on beyond whatever happens to the current management.Two days out, addressing the media from the SCG’s windowless press dungeon, he sounded calm, settled and full of road still to run. Press conference Crawley is decisively post-Bazball these days. At the SCG he was all dead bat and soft hands.View image in fullscreenBrendon McCullum (left) talks with Zak Crawley during a practice session at the SCG.Photograph: Mark Baker/APWould losing 3-2 make a big difference to the mood of the tour? “It might not go our way but if we can put in a good performance this week I think it shows a lot about us.”Was the chase in Melbourne a gamechanger? “I felt like we had some clarity about that chase … When you’re chasing a score like that it gives you a lot of clarity about how you’re going to play.”Has he had a good series? “Obviously I would have liked a couple of bigger scores than I could manage to change the course of a couple of games. Hopefully I can do that this week and contribute to a win.”OK then. How is Matthew Potts looking? “Every time I face him he impresses me, he’s got the heart of a lion, a lot of skill and if he gets the nod this week he thoroughly deserves it.”Is he inspired by his 77 here four years ago? And is a Zebra a horse with stripes, or a horse a plain version of a zebra?Ben Stokes wants McCullum to stay as England coach despite Ashes lossRead more“I feel like I really enjoy playing my cricket in Sydney, so hopefully I can lean on that and create more memories.”Is he a leader in this team? And what, if the universe is both expanding and also infinite, is the universe expanding into? How does infinity expand?“I just try to lead by example if anything, go about my business and stay in my lane. I know what my role is and just try to do that as well as possible.”There was at least a glimpse of shoot-from-the-hip Crawley, the guy who just wants to chase more, who thinks 3-2 would make a good series score, when he was asked about batting against spinner Todd Murphy, who may play at the SCG.“Whoever plays, I think that’s the mantra of our team: to try to put pressure on people. Todd’s a very good bowler, but I can envisage us trying to put some pressure on him, like we would all their bowlers.”Explore more on these topicsAshes 2025-26The AshesCricketEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He answered with ease, detailing the specific mental challenges of facing the new ball. Minutes later, he was asked how Australia can unite after last month’s terrorist attack at Bondi Beach. Again, there was little hesitation before the lengthy reply. He cited the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, politicians who “try to divide and conquer” and closed with his reflections on the tragedy itself. This was no ordinary sporting farewell.Usman Khawaja’s retirement farewell shows how cricket can be an expression of character | Gideon HaighRead moreThose who have tracked the path of Khawaja’s career closely will not have been surprised by the openness in the 50-minute press conference on Friday and the lines to have come from it. Reflecting on his proud journey as a Muslim boy born in Pakistan “who was told he would never play for the Australian cricket team”, Khawaja claimed he was still subject to “racial stereotypes”, arguing they had re-emerged at the start of the Ashes when he was scrutinised for playing golf in the buildup beforesustaining back spasms in the first Test.“The way everyone came at me about my preparation was quite personal,” said Khawaja, “in terms of things like, ‘he’s not committed to the team’, ‘he was only worried about himself’, ‘he played this golf comp the day before’, ‘he’s selfish’, ‘he doesn’t train hard enough’, ‘he didn’t train the day before game’, ‘he’s lazy’. These are the same stereotypes – racial stereotypes – I’ve grown up with my whole life.”This desire to veer into such conversations is uncommon in Khawaja’s profession, even if there was an initial reluctance to get too personal at the start of his career. When heemerged at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 2011, he appeared a reluctant trailblazer. The then 24-year-old downplayed the mark he had immediately made as the first Muslim to play for Australia. “You can make something out of anything,” he said at the time. “You can say that Michael Beer is the first person who sticks his tongue out 24/7 to play for Australia.”As time went on, he opened up. In 2017, he wrote about the racism he endured when growing up in western Sydney, the mark left on him when called “curry-muncher” by kids at school, how when he watched Australia play “he saw men who were hard-nosed, confident, almost brutish. The same type of men who would sledge me about my heritage growing up.”He spoke more openly about the impact of his faith, the contentment it provided, and his voice has been prominent and assured when discussing the plight of Palestinians. A couple of rather simple, straightforward slogans on his shoes – “All lives are equal” and “Freedom is a human right” –brought the ire of the International Cricket Council two years ago. “I put myself out there,” said Khawaja on Friday, adding that is why he has been “nailed a lot of the time over the last two years”.1:33Usman Khawaja announces retirement from international cricket - videoWhen discussing the stereotypes he claims to have been subject to by the media and former players, Khawaja did not detail specifics, and some further explanation would have been welcome. But maybe greater attention should be paid to social media: it does not take much effort to find the venom that comes Khawaja’s way over there, to recognise the age-old rhythm to the abuse: that he should stick to sports. Khawaja, unflinching, offered a reminder that he has no intention to do so.A message of hope was in there, too. Khawaja talked about the game being more inclusive in Australia than when he started, that “we’re a lot better than where we were 15 years ago”. It can also be said with great certainty that he has inspired future generations, right from the very beginning when he hammered a pull off Chris Tremlett for his first boundary in Test cricket.Some transparency is required here. I watched that opening knock as an impressionable 13-year-old and was grateful for quite a simple thing: someone who looked like me, another Pakistan-born immigrant, doing something I loved, at the highest possible level. He was instantly a hero. He has been a fascinating watch ever since, resuscitating his career at various points, his revival in 2022 particularly stirring. For a period, he really was the best red-ball opener in the world. Khawaja will finish up over the coming days at the SCG, where it all began, but his voice will remain worth listening to.Explore more on these topicsUsman KhawajaAshes 2025-26The AshesAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportCricketcommentShareReuse this content"

Glasner has made no secret of his desire to bolster the FA Cup winners after a demanding debut campaign in Europe and has criticised Palace’s lack of preparedness in previous transfer windows. However, the Austrian manager said he was delighted with the signing of the 24-year-old after Palace saw off competition from Bournemouth.“He arrives very early in the window, so credit to the club for making this happen so quickly,” said Glasner. “Brennan will give us options in our attacking play with his pace and goalscoring ability and with all the upcoming games he will be a valuable addition to the squad.”Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball.

Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Palace have been tracking the former Nottingham Forest forward for some time and agreed a deal with Spurs on Tuesday that surpasses the fee paid to buy Christian Benteke from Liverpool in August 2016. It is understood Johnson, who has struggled for game time at Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season and started only six times in thePremier League, was keen to stay in London.Johnson, who scored the goal thatwon Spurs the Europa Leaguelast May, said: “Crystal Palace are such a great club, one that I’ve always admired. It’s a great time for me to be here and join the journey that this club is on – I’m super-excited.”His departure means Spurs have sold their leading scorers from the past three seasons, Johnson following Son Heung-min and Harry Kane in leaving. Tottenham are expected to bring in a replacement in January, with Manchester City’s Savinho and Yan Diomande of RB Leipzig believed to be among their targets.Palace hope to strengthen their squad further and have held talks with Angers over the 19-year-old forward Sidiki Chérif, although they face stiff competition from Paris FC. Glasner would also like more cover at right-back despite Daniel Muñoz getting closer to his return from a knee injury and Genk’s Zakaria El Ouahdi and Vanderson of Monaco have been linked. Palace are also in the market for midfield reinforcements and have targeted an ambitious move for Kees Smit of AZ, who is wanted by Newcastle and Real Madrid.Brightonhave confirmed the return of their former captain Pascal Gross on a contract until the end of next season after the 34-year-old left to joinBorussia Dortmundin August 2024. “He’s a fantastic player and someone I know well and was looking forward to working with when I first came to the club,” said the head coach, Fabian Hürzeler. “Brighton fans know his attributes, but he brings great leadership qualities to the group. Those qualities, along with his experience and ability, will be a huge asset.”Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowCrystal PalaceTottenham HotspurPremier LeaguenewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach is dealing with numerous problems as he navigates what always stood to be a transitional season, the most insistent being his team’s lack of creativity.Spurs were booed off after Thursday’s0-0 draw at Brentfordby the travelling support, who also chanted “boring, boring Tottenham”. But Frank is confident he will come to look back on the first half of his debut campaign more fondly once – and not if – his squad emerges on the other side, stronger and wiser for the suffering. Tottenham are 12th in the Premier League – their next game is at home to Sunderland on Sunday and Frank leant into a marathon-running analogy when he was asked whether he was enjoying the challenge to which he has signed up.Liam Rosenior opens door to Chelsea job but must wait on BlueCo dealingsRead more“When you need to put in a big, big shift and it’s not smooth and it’s tough, it’s probably difficult to enjoy it,” he said. “If I run hard I don’t enjoy that moment but I know I need to keep my head down and run hard to get through it. We are in a situation where you need to run hard, to stay in it. When we look back on this spell or maybe this first year when it was tough, you’ll think: ‘What a learning, what an experience, it made us so much better for the future.’“So the short answer is: no [he is not enjoying his job]. The reality is you can’t. But when I put myself out of it and look down, I think: ‘What a privilege to be in charge of this fantastic club in a period where it’s a big transition.’ It’s definitely a marathon and it definitely seems like it’s one of the more heavy miles I’m on now, but head down and keep going.”Frank repeated himself about the issues at the club, with injuries prominent among them, especially to attacking players. He has been deprived of Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison all season and Dominic Solanke for all but the first three games. Solanke has now returned to training. “When I walked in the door I didn’t expect Solanke and Maddison to be out for seven months, or for Kulusevski not to be ready,” he said.Frank’s comment about Kulusevski was interesting given it was reported on 21 August that the playerwould be out until around the turn of the year. In other words, he ought to be back about now, at least to training. Kulusevski is not yet in training. Xavi Simons will also miss the Sunderland game as he completes a three-match ban while Lucas Bergvall is an injury doubt.Tottenham’s travails at home in the league have been well-documented. Ditto the strain placed on the squad by their involvement in the Champions League. Ditto the unprecedented number of changes at executive level, the most notable being the departure of Daniel Levy. There is expected to be another one with the co-sporting director, Fabio Paratici, heavily linked with a move to Fiorentina. It raised a few eyebrows when the winger, Manor Solomon, cut short his loan at Villarreal this week to switch to Fiorentina, also on loan.View image in fullscreenFabio Paratici (left) in the stands with the Tottenham chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, at Crystal Palace on 28 December.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockFrank was asked who Paratici was working for. “Good question, maybe you know,” he said with a smile before re-joining the party line. “Fabio is Tottenham sporting director. I spoke to him twice yesterday. He is working very hard for Tottenham.”Frank knows endlessly listing the club’s problems is tedious. “This is where we are right now,” he insisted. “It’s unfortunately very boring but that’s the fact.” What Frank made clear was that this was a time for Spurs to hold their nerve – in terms of the overall situation and, more specifically, the January transfer window where the pressure for additions has been increased by the£35m sale of Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have also loaned defender Kota Takai, who joined them last summer for £5m from Kawasaki Frontale, to Borussia Mönchengladbach for the remainder of the season.Frank’s message is that only players who will help the club towards the long-term goal of challenging for silverware will be considered. He is not interested in buying himself time and credit with signings who would only provide a short-term boost. “We will do everything we can to improve the squad,” he said. “But short-term impact can’t limit long-term success. The flip-side is that if we can do something that will really improve us, we should go very hard for that.“We have lists of players in every position. Is No 6 [on the list] good enough for us to get to where we want to be in the future? Probably not. But it’s a fine balance.“Sometimes you need to take some steps forward before we can get the perfect solution.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

The reality is that his job will come under serious threat should Celtic lose Saturday’s Old Firm fixture.The2-0 loss to Motherwellon Tuesday was the fifth reverse of his seven games in charge. The performance at Fir Park was especially dismal, which raised the latest set of questions about the former Columbus Crew coach’s suitability for his role. If Rangers win at Celtic Park they would draw level with their oldest foes despite their own unconvincing start to the campaign. Both trail Hearts in the Premiership.Scottish Premiership: Nancy’s Celtic slump to fifth defeat as Said inspires MotherwellRead more“This is only the beginning,” Nancy said. “Usually, we have four weeks of pre-season. I did not have pre-season. Before I came, I knew that if I don’t win games I am going to be in trouble because this is part of the job. But I am pleased to be here. I know where we are now. I am not an underdog.“In context, I knew this kind of situation could happen. I need time. Give me time and you will see my team. You are going to see what I am going to do because you can see already what I did before.“I didn’t start [in coaching] yesterday. If you do your job you will see the way I want to play, the way I defend, the way I want to attack; it is clear. It is totally normal that you guys, you kill me. I am fine with that. I am totally fine with that because I know where I want to go. Judge me in a few weeks, months.”A common criticism of Nancy has been the regular deployment of a three-man defence, for which Celtic are ill-suited. The club’s board face a dilemma this month over whether to spend significant money to help Nancy with his long-term aspirations or admit they have made an error in hiring him. AfterBrendan Rodgers left in October, Martin O’Neill led Celtic to seven wins out of eight while in caretaker charge.“Obviously people are not happy,” Nancy said. “I, too, am not happy. I see only a few glimpses of what we are trying to do, but I am pleased with that after only 12 or 13 [training] sessions.Wilfried Nancy’s Venn diagram and the optics of controlling the controllables | Max RushdenRead more“This is the context. It is a fact we have not had the results we wanted, I can not deny that. A few players have been here five, six, seven years and were doing things in a certain way. It takes time. If you do your job, you will see what I do. If you are going to be patient, you are going to see what I can do.“For the moment, this is a tornado. I knew that. Is it easy to handle that? No, but I am ready for that. Analyse all the games since I have been here, whether we should win or lose. Do it. For now, I shut my mouth and I take it, but I know where we are going.“This is not normal but it is expected; you do not win, you get killed. We are second, but because we lost a few games it is like we are last. I understand the context. I understand the narrative. I am not saying I accept it, but that is another debate.”The noise surrounding – and created by – Nancy is just one element of Celtic’s fraught position. Supporters are generally angry with the board, who had tosuspend their annual general meetingdue to unrest. Rodgers was astonishingly attacked by Dermot Desmond, the main shareholder, at the time of his exit, while Peter Lawwell, the Celtic chair, resigned last month, citing “threats and abuse”. This feels a club at constant odds with itself. A derby win would only briefly calm dissent.Nancy’s comments are likely to have raised eyebrows atRangers. Danny Röhl, their manager, had already spoken in upbeat terms about what will be his second taste of an Old Firm fixture.“We are ready,” he said. “We have a big confidence at the moment, we have a big belief.”Explore more on these topicsCelticRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

Henry Arundell is speeding down the Bath right, nearly into Saints’ 22, after a defensive error by Henry Pollock. A try for the champions looks a certainty before the flanker desperately dives at Arundell and dislodges the ball from his grasp.A dextrous pick-up by George Hendy allows him to sprint downfield before setting up Pollock to dive over – 13 seconds after Arundell was threatening at the other end.The Breakdown | ‘There is no ceiling for these players’: Jamaica targeting 2031 Rugby World CupRead more“I showed that clip [to the squad] a couple of times,” said Northampton’s director of rugby, Phil Dowson, while preparing to meet Harlequins at Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday. “I wanted to highlight the work of Chicky, chugging back as fast as he possibly could and just about getting a hand on him.“That effort, that hustle back and chasing lost causes is what gave us the opportunity to re-apply pressure and go the length. It’s those small things – the ability to stick at it.”Chick concedes he can’t take credit for the try – “I sat on the floor and watched Hendy run 80 metres” – but says Northampton scoring in such ruthless fashion from a turnover is no accident: “We pride ourselves on being one of the hardest-working teams off the ball. Those turnover opportunities or where the ball’s on the ground can be the best. We practise it in training and speak about it all the time so it isn’t just luck, it’s a skill we practise and learn.”The combative back-rower left Newcastle last summer after a decade, citing his ambition to add to thetwo England caps he won under Eddie Jones in 2021. Having endured some difficult days last season, Northampton are riding high in the Prem and the 29-year-old’s arrival is one reason they have become harder to beat.“There’s a hard edge to the pack,” he says. “If you look at some ofthe stats around dominant carries and dominant tackleswe’re top, or near top, in all of them.” Northampton do indeed lead the way for dominant contacts, dominant carries and dominant tackles.“People like [South African lock] JJ van der Mescht, who’s a big human, really help with that. They are a bunch of good blokes who want to work hard for each other. You can have 15 fantastic rugby players who don’t want to be there and you’re terrible.”View image in fullscreenCallum Chick claims a lineout against Bath.Photograph: Simon King/ProSports/ShutterstockSwapping Newcastle for Northampton must have been a culture shock although his fellow geordie, the prop Trevor Davison, has helped Chick settle in. What does he do for fun in his new home town? “That’s a great question,” he says. “When you find something, will you let me know?“I’m not going to lie, it’s a great town, but there’s not a huge amount to do. I live with [fellow flanker] Josh Kemeny so spend time with him and we get on really well. We go for the odd coffee or to the sauna.”On a more serious note, Chick explains how the rugby-obsessed Saints fans have welcomed him: “Everyone’s lovely. If you wander the streets people say: ‘Well done’ or ‘How’s it going?’ It’s a bit different from Newcastle in that sense, that’s a very football-dominated city so you could wander about town pretty inconspicuously.“Northampton is really nice and everyone comes down on a Saturday – it’s another sellout this weekend. They love their rugby and that community feel makes all the difference.”Saints appear well-equipped for an assault on domestic and European silverware – Dowson rested several key players for the victory in Bath – and Chick knows that will be crucial come spring. “It’s a long season so rotation and having that strength in depth is really important,” he says. “To get to knockout rugby you have to win games. But when knockout rugby comes, if you’ve had the chance to rotate and keep boys fresh, you’re in a much better place than if you’ve flogged everyone for six to seven months.”The former Newcastle captain is happy to see his boyhood club enteran exciting new era as the Red Bulls– “hugely important and hugely exciting for the area”, he says. “The players and fans deserve it, but on a deeper level it was looking pretty ominous at the end of last year for people having jobs. Just to keep people employed is hugely important. They’ve done so much work over many years and it would have been horrible to see it go.”Newcastle will always have a place in Chick’s heart, but victory over Harlequins – and keeping Northampton on top – is all that matters now.Explore more on these topicsNorthamptonRugby unionPrem RugbyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even if each practice isn’t as perfect as you want it to be, I think just the consistency of it is the most important thing. That’s what really helped me last year. So I just hope to carry that on and enjoy the tennis, enjoy the process of what I’m doing, which right now I am.”Venus Williams, 45, gets wild card to play first Australian Open in five yearsRead moreRaducanu begins her year having finally appeared to have found some stability after a turbulent start to her career. The 23-year-old enjoyed her most consistent season in 2025, remaining healthy enough to compete regularly and return to the top 30 of the WTA rankings at No 9. Her coaching partnership with Francisco Roig, the former coach of Rafael Nadal, has looked promising since they began working together in August and her team now includes the physiotherapist and strength and conditioning coach, Emma Stewart, who most recently worked for British Rowing.“Physically I also improved,” said Raducanu. “I became fitter, so I was able to play more matches and more tournaments on the road. That just gives us more opportunities to get some points here and there and also have good weeks when you’re in a good run of momentum to kind of carry that through three, four, five matches. So yeah, that was a really good benefit for me as well. Also, just my approach to playing. I’ve been a lot better, a lot more composed, but at the same time enjoying it a lot more again. That’s been a big win for me.”This year marks the fourth edition of the United Cup, with the event split between Perth and Sydney in the round-robin group stages before the final knockout rounds take place in Sydney. Other notable competitors this year include Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Jasmine Paolini, Alexander Zverev, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Taylor Fritz. The ATP, WTA andTennisAustralia have admirably invested significant money and time into attempting to build a serious mixed-gender team competition. Unlike the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup, which are organised by the ITF, the competition offers ranking points in hopes of attracting top players.Last year’s edition marked a positive step forward for the event, particularly with the final between the USA and Poland showcasing one of the leading rivalries of the sport in Gauff’s intense, high quality win over Swiatek en route to the USA’s victory. However, the event is yet to attract either Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner, which would take it to another level. Next week, the top two men’s players will instead compete in a lucrative exhibition match together in South Korea.The British team is rounded out by Billy Harris, Neal Skupski, Olivia Nicholls, Jan Choinski and Katie Swan, with Tim Henman the team captain. Harris is the team’s first-choice singles player, while Skupski will likely compete alongside either Nicholls or Raducanu in mixed doubles. Choinski and Swan will act as the singles substitutes. Britain have been drawn into a difficult three-team group as they begin against Japan on Sunday before facing a Greek team led by Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari on Monday.View image in fullscreenTim Henman, Katie Swan, Billy Harris, Emma Raducanu and Olivia Nicholls on Rottnest Island before the United Cup.Photograph: Paul Kane/Getty Images for Tennis AustraliaUntil a few weeks ago, Britain was one of the favourites for the title after Jack Draper was announced in the team alongside Raducanu. Draper has since withdrawnfrom the entire Australian swingdue to his continued recovery from the bone bruise injury to his left arm that has essentially sidelined him for at least six months. The 24-year-old has contested just one match since Wimbledon, when he was ranked No 4,withdrawing before his second-round matchat the US Open.Harris, aged 30 and ranked No in the world 128, also replaced Draper in this competition last year as the British No 1 navigated a hip injury. Although he was competitive against much higher-ranked opponents, Harris lost all three men’s singles matches. This time, he only found out he would be competing there again this year on Christmas Eve, two days before Draper announced his withdrawal: “I was training at the National Centre, and obviously Jack was training throughout December,” he said. “I was staying ready just in case he couldn’t make it out here and then found out the news I think on just the day before Christmas. In my head I was preparing as if I could play. Unfortunate that Jack couldn’t make it, but a great opportunity for myself.”Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

You’re not going to tell anyone about this, are you?” Rozanov, lying naked beside him, replies sarcastically: “Me? Yes, Hollander, I’m going to tell everyone.” Hollander reinforces the point: “Because no one can know,” he says. Rozanov utters something under his breath in Russian, then: “Hollander. Look, I’m not going to tell anyone, OK?” Hollander replies: “OK.”No one can know. If hockey were to have an unofficial slogan, this might be it. Heated Rivalry, the surprise 2025 hit series from Crave andHBO, is layered drama, prompting timely questions about the barriers to acceptance that persist within sport even as they are lowered elsewhere across society. But it may be that hockey’s existential battle with its culture of silence is the show’s deepest target.Minnesota Wild go all-in with blockbuster trade for Norris winner Quinn HughesRead moreHockey culture presents a paradox, simultaneously welcoming yet exclusive. When theNHLlaunched its Hockey Is For Everyone initiative in 2017, the league was making a point about attracting new fans from groups that did not typically see themselves reflected on the ice, including members of the LGBTQ+ community. It was a savvy business move, if nothing else. “Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the league’s first report on diversity and inclusion in 2022. Inclusion, Bettman wrote, is a “driver for performance … individuals and organizations grow stronger from uniting across differences”. Times were changing, lessons were being learned. Briefly, anyway. The 2022 “annual” report has since been scrubbed from the NHL’s website (it remains available elsewhere). And while the league continues to work on inclusivity initiatives and claims it is attracting more women fans, there has not been another report since.Just a few months after that diversity report’s release, in January 2023, Ivan Provorov, then a defenseman for the Philadelphia Flyers,refused to wear a Pride-themed jerseyduring a pre-game warm-up, saying it conflicted with his religious beliefs. The jerseys had been introduced as part of the Hockey Is For Everyone initiative and were typically auctioned afterwards to raise money for local charities. In the weeks that followed, more players refused to wear their team’s Pride jersey. Rather than push back or make the jerseys a requirement like any other aspect of a team’s uniform, the NHL officially walked away from it all, eliminating the jerseys. The whole thing had “just become more of a distraction from really the essence of what the purpose of these nights are,” Bettman said that summer.View image in fullscreenA Canucks player uses Pride tape on his stick during a 2024 game in Vancouver, British Columbia.Photograph: Jeff Vinnick/NHLI/Getty ImagesIn hockey, nobody wants to be a distraction. “[The players told me] it doesn’t matter if you’re gay, or concussed, or you’ve been sexually abused or have mental health issues, none of those are OK because you are a distraction,” Cheryl MacDonald, former co-chair of the western Canadian board of You Can Play, said of her interviews with a handful of gay hockey players in 2019. MacDonald had wondered why more gay players did not choose to come out. “You don’t want to risk it not being OK, because the perception is someone who is just as good at your job but isn’t gay is going to take your spot,” she said at the time. Better to say nothing at all.”In the penultimate episode of Heated Rivalry, another gay player unexpectedly invites his boyfriend on to the ice to help celebrate a championship win. They kiss in front of tens of thousands of fans and, presumably, millions of viewers at home. It is a public coming out. The show pivots immediately to how this impacts Hollander and Rozanov and offers very little sense of how the kiss was received more broadly, but amid the on-ice embrace, the crowd appears enraptured, not appalled. The TV announcer simply says: “You don’t see that every day.” Well, no. But if we did?In the same 2019 study, MacDonald also found that once gay players did come out, their teammates generally reacted positively – and the typical homophobic jibes that persist in hockey locker rooms were muted. Moreover, the banter eventually incorporated their orientation, with straight players more respectfully making light of the gay players’ sexuality. “The gay players said the acknowledgement was nice … it seems there is room for consensual humor,” MacDonald noted. Likely, few in the hockey world would find that surprising either; just part of the frustrating paradox at the heart of its culture.Heated Rivalry’s popularity has prompted plenty of speculation about whether it will attract new fans to hockey and to the NHL. But they are already here – watching, spending, supporting. Playing. And learning, often from a young age, what part of themselves they should keep quiet because, y’know, no one can know. As for the NHL, in December, a spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter that “there are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL’s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans. See you at the rink.” The line is cheerful, harmless and, in typical fashion, empty. Even when the conversation is unavoidable, the NHL still has little to say. It seems that for the league, this is not about hockey. It is still just a distraction.Explore more on these topicsNHLIce hockeyUS sportsHBOTelevisionUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This should be his big year, the make-or-break 2026. Last year his Reform party finally began to top the polls and he was feted by Washington as the UK’s Trump andnext prime minister. So how now would he turn a sheaf of poll results into a disciplined election-winning machine? Or has he for the past year merely been doing what most third parties do at this stage of a parliament, which is feast on the misfortune of their opponents?The polls sent Reform surging into a steady lead last spring. It held that position through the summer, with a high of29%according to YouGov, and33%according to More in Common. But pollsters now suggest thatFarage’s party may have peaked– with YouGov’s December polling showing a drop in its vote share to 26%, its lowest since April. Some of this has been credited toincreasing supportfor the Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and to the joint Lib Dem/Green vote surging to nearly 30%. It seems likely that this confusion will survive through this May’s local elections. Betting in this field is for madmen.Meanwhile Farage’s Reform remains a classic one-man show. I recall interviewing him before the referendum about how things were going in his back office. Was it still the much-publicised chaos? He gazed up at the ceiling. The fact is that British politics has long handled the occasional star performer, an Enoch Powell, Roy Jenkins, Nye Bevan, Lloyd George or Winston Churchill. But it rarely votes “presidentially” to put them into office. The US votes for populist stars, relying on its constitution to curb any resulting autocracy. Britain votes for parties and their programmes.Alexis de Tocqueville’s famous claim that American politics defaults to the mob and British politics to the club was never truer than it is today. The electoral success of the Tories over the past century has been rooted in presenting the voters with a disciplined group of reasonably competent ministers. They obeyed one vital requirement of cabinet government, collective loyalty. They worked and socialised together and governed as friends. The same was true of many Labour cabinets.That tradition survived even through the Cameron years. It collapsed under the conspiratorial era of Boris Johnson and has never recovered. The concept of the internecine cabinet emerged into the open and has never disappeared. It can be seen today in the absurd factionalism of Keir Starmer’s first year in office, with ministers and officials relentlesslybriefingagainst each other.The same applies to Farage. He has to defend his colleagues – and himself – from one unfortunate remark after another. It has turned leadership and even membership into a revolving door. Reform has had three chairs in under two years. They come and go in the night. Reform’s latest leader in Wales iscurrently in prison.The result is barely recognisable as a party. Reform’s nearest thing to a shadow chancellor appears to be a property tycoon,Nick Candy. There is no core of seasoned professionals that is so important to electoral success. There is rather a stage army of dissident former Tory MPs such as Andrea Jenkyns, Ann Widdecombe and Danny Kruger. None is famous for party loyalty. Reform’s chief whip, Lee Anderson, had previously stood both for election for the Labour party and the Conservative party.Farage has tried desperately to position his party on the political spectrum. He grovelled his way to Mar-a-Lago to be lauded by Trump and Elon Musk. He then had toendure Musk’s contemptwhen he refused to back the appalling Tommy Robinson. He wisely distanced himself from Trump’s more extreme associates, such as theHeritage Foundation. But he purports to be a friend of Steve Bannon and has spent time withJD Vance. This is risky when Trump isway below par among British voters, with 22% for and 72% against.On policy, Farage runs another risk in identifying himself almost solely with immigration. Single-issue parties may do well in a good year, but who knows where immigration will be in 2029? Reform may have 12 councils under its belt, but whether its adoption of Musk’schainsaw approachto public spending is a vote-winner remains to be seen. Farage is now frantically identifying issues such asthe countrysideand net-zero energy subsidies on which Tories might switch to him.Farage has undeniable charisma on the platform. He can be affable, humorous, passionate and concise: qualities suited to de Tocqueville’s mob but absent from his club. They will also be absent from Westminster’s murky offices and corridors over the next two years. The one reliable prediction is that the next election will send to Westminster the multiparty shambles of a hung parliament. From that I do not expect Farage to emerge on top.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionReform UKDonald TrumpImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

Today the NHS rolls out a new jab, alongside measles, mumps and rubellaWes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careThu 1 Jan 2026 23.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 05.07 ESTShareAs any parent knows, there are few things more disruptive to family life than a child covered from head to toe in itchy chickenpox spots. The sleepless nights. The constant application of calamine lotion. The scramble to take time off work while your little one recovers.That’s why today’s expansion of the NHS childhood vaccination programme will come as such a relief to so many families. The new combined vaccine, free on the NHS, will protect young children in England against chickenpox (varicella), measles, mumps and rubella. Children will be offered theMMRV vaccineat 12 and 18 months of age, and GP surgeries in England are contacting families from today to arrange appointments. This will mean fewer days missed from nursery and school, fewer urgent calls to the GP and fewer parents having to miss work.Research showsthat half of children catch chickenpox by the age of four, and 90% by the time they are 10 years old. While most cases resolve on their own, chickenpox costs families and the wider economy around £24m a year in lost income and productivity. This new vaccine will help reduce that burden considerably.But beyond the practical benefits, this rollout addresses something more serious. Chickenpox is often thought of as a mild childhood illness, but it can lead to severe complications requiring hospitalisation – including bacterial infections such as group A streptococcus, pneumonia and encephalitis. Even in recent years, there have been cases that have leftchildren on morphine in hospital, with others gettingpneumonia and joint infections– and even seriousflesh-eating diseases.The combined MMRV vaccine has been safely used for decades, and is already part of routine vaccination programmes in several countries. The US, Canada, Australia and Germanyhave all seen substantial decreasesin chickenpox cases and hospital admissions since rolling out their programmes. In the US alone, the vaccinehas preventedan estimated 91m cases of chickenpox in 25 years, as well as 238,000 hospitalisations and almost 2,000 deaths.The evidence is clear: vaccines work. Theyprevent millions of deathsworldwide every year. Diseases such as smallpox, polio and tetanus, which once killed or disabled millions of people, have over the past 50 years either gone or are nowvery rarely seen.In this government’s10-year health plan, we set out how we are supporting parents to raise the healthiest generation of children ever, shifting the health service from sickness to prevention and strengthening public trust in vaccination. At a time when misinformation spreads quickly online, it’s more important than ever that people are able to trust in medical science, and the research scientists, analysts and clinicians who follow the evidence. In some countries, it’s clear that access to vaccines and accurate information about themhas been restricted, withordinary people paying the price.Building trust is why I’ve pushed back so hard against therhetoric that ignores scientific evidenceabout the excellent safety profile and effectiveness of vaccines.It is always OK for people to ask questions or want to know more about why vaccines are important; it’s why we regularly make sure people haveup-to-date information, and make sure that expert clinicians are in the media explaining why they’re safe.But the doubt and misinformation seeded even by those politicians who should know better, such as Nigel Farage andsenior figures in Reform, undermine public health. Worse, they undermine the trust that people put into our health service.We’re fortunate in Britain to have a healthcare system built on clinical excellence and peerless research. Today’svaccine rolloutis based on decades of scientific evidence. By reducing severe cases and complications, this programme is expected to save the NHS around £15m a year in costs for treatment. But most importantly,it will help protect thousandsof children from becoming seriously unwell.Wes Streeting is the secretary of state for health and social care and Labour MP for Ilford NorthDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Let’s do this!Fri 2 Jan 2026 07.16 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 10.01 ESTShareMondayAt last. I have been waiting a year for this moment. I must apologise to you all. Twelve months ago, in this very organ, nay in this very diary, I noted that we were now in the hazy, lazy, crazy days between Boxing Day and new year and thus wished you all a happy “Christmas perineum”. It should have been, of course, “Merryneum”. It has been bothering me ever since. I can only put it down to post-turkey malaise. If it helps, it is only while Googling around this subject to write this entry that I have realised that the nickname “taint” – for the fleshly rather than festive part under discussion – refers to the fact that “’t ain’t the front, ’t ain’t the back”. I think perhaps I knew this at some level but hadn’t consciously made the connection. Anyway. I offer the knowledge to you here in some kind of twisted act of contrition.And now that I have lost all linguistic authority, let me weigh in on this year’s vexed question: is it, in polite company at least, “Twixmas” or “Twixtmas”? Well, unless you have a sponsorship deal with Mars, it’s Twixtmas. It’s the “between time” and the fact that we’re all stuffing ourselves with chocolate during it is merely incidental. (’T) ain’t no argument otherwise.TuesdayMy greatest hope is on the brink of being realised. Late last year, John Lewis officially became a members’ club. It always was, in essence: you spend years hoping that you can join (though it is in your disposable income’s gift, rather than requiring nomination by an already anointed individual); you have to pretend you are there to choose soft furnishings but you are really revelling in the safety offered by proximity to like-minded souls; you pay your fees in the guise of retail prices for kettles, new pillows or a rice cooker at the counter every visit instead of annually by direct debit; and instead of lingering for hours over claret and cigars, it’s coffee and cake, but aside from those peripheral differences, the place is a club.But in November, a members’ lounge opened for a trial run in the flagship Oxford Street store. You could bring two friends, enjoy a complimentary drink, partake of Waitrose chocolates and Benugo nibbles and just rest easy knowing that, in some ineffable but deeply pleasing sense, you had made it.My prayer is that this is the beginning of something big. A JL lounge in every high street, a place to go for those too old, tired and infuriated by ambient music to find the pub restorative any more. Please, please 2026 – let us have this.WednesdayNew Year’s Eve! My favourite night of the year. No, really. It is when the “jomo” – the joy of missing out – is at its strongest, its most restorative and delicious.I cannot remember when I last left the house on NYE. I think it may have been for the advent of the new millennium, which if my calculations are correct is now a quarter of a century ago. So for 25 years now, I have waved off my more vibrant, sociable brethren – which is to say, all of them – enjoining them to drink deep of their own fountain of pleasure wheresoever they find it, while I have stayed in with a plate of smoked salmon, some champagne and all my books. May you all have as much fun. I charge my glass, raise it and wish you all an easily found taxi home. You fools.ThursdayNew Year’s Day! Also a good time. Largely because I no longer make resolutions for myself (apart from this year, again, to start a Substack and to read Middlemarch). I make them for the rest of the world instead. Nothing absurd, like global peace or a return to democracy or anything like that. I keep it small and manageable. This year, I want sunken living rooms (“conversation pits” in the parlance of the 1970s, the last time they were fashionable) to make a comeback. So cosy! So civilised! So different without disturbing things too much! Let’s do this.And I want “either” and “each” sorted out. I was taught that “either” means “one or the other” (“They walked either side of the road” – they were free to choose, neither side being pitted with obstacles or mantraps) and “each” means … well, each. “They walked on each side of the road” – one walked on one side, another walked on the other. So a sentence like what I have just read in a book: “There was a tree either side of the road” makes no real sense. There was a tree each side, sure. But unless it is an ambulant tree, or your character cannot remember which part of the road it was on, “either” has nothing to do with it. Let’s sort it. I know we can.FridayAnd now the best day of the year: World Introvert Day! Jan 2, we love you. You are so perfectly timed, after the near-unbearable business of the festive season. Just as humanity threatens to overwhelm, we can point to this date, this sacred date, and say: “No more.”Quietly, separately and in our own different ways, those of us who prefer to stay in except under very few, very specific and highly controlled circumstances, celebrate. I plan to stay even more firmly in than I did on New Year’s Eve, and to increase the solitude by sending the husband and child out for the day.“Do you not like us?” asks my son.“I love you,” I explain. “I just can’t stand you.”Happy 2026, everyone.Explore more on these topicsUK newsDigested weeknewsShareReuse this content"

That’s the reality facing more and more people in BritainKirsty MajorChristine wanted to enjoy her retirement, but then the banks of a local brook burst and turned her and her neighbours’ lives upside-downFri 2 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 14.03 ESTShareWhen I visited Christine’s bungalow in Trowell, Nottinghamshire, and asked if I should take my shoes off, she joked: “I wouldn’t worry, I’ll be getting a new carpet soon enough when it floods again.” She’s got another good one about the time she, a 70-year-old great-grandmother, had to climb through her conservatory window because her front and back doors had been sealed shut by flood barriers. “If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry,” she says. And there is a lot to cry about: mainly the fact that her home is unsellable due to multiple floods.In 2020, the brook that backs on to Christine’s home burst its banks and water poured into her house, as well as the homes of her neighbours Jackie, 67, and Rhona, 76. As we sit around a table drinking tea, they tell me about having to rip out their floorboards, skirting boards, kitchen cupboards and entire bathrooms. Doors had to be taken off their hinges and thrown into skips. Fridges, washing machines, furniture, all joined the pile.Fortunately, their insurers paid for their houses to be refurbished and for furniture to be replaced. Property Flood Resilience assessments were carried out by the Environment Agency (EA), the government body responsible for flood management. As not enough houses were affected, the optimum but most expensive solution – to install embankments and walls to stop water from topping the brook – was not implemented. (For context, the EA has faced an overall cut in its funding of50%during the past decade.)Instead, the cheaper alternative of flood-proofing individual houses was offered. Christine, Jackie and Rhona had a mix of flood doors and barriers installed, and were provided with pumps to remove any water that did make it into their properties. In 2023, having been delayed by Covid, the work was finally completed. Eight months later, their houses flooded again.It turns out the assessments had missed the fact that their homes were built on platforms and the water was coming up through the ground and into them. The barriers provided only stopped surface water from getting into their properties.While they were telling me this, heavy rain began to thud on the conservatory roof. Christine looked concerned. “It makes you panic,” she says. In bad weather, the women remain vigilant for the next flood warning. When there is one, they log on to the relevant government website and stay up during the night, fully dressed, messaging one another in their group chat and checking the levels provided by a gauge fixed to the brook.Jackie has an exact plan of how to stack her furniture so that some of it can be saved, and plastic raisers to place under what furniture can’t be stacked. Then there are the flood barriers to be erected in her garage and outside her back door. I lifted one up, and it felt as heavy as a barbell. This is no way for a pensioner to live, but as far as the EA is concerned, it has done its job for Christine, Jackie and Rhona. The work carried out has made them “flood-resilient” rather than flood-proof.Floodingis to be expected, and damage minimised.Residents believe that the flooding began after the building of multiple nearby housing developments, with one more leisure development to come.Extra discharge and surface runoff now drain into the brook. According to the lead local flood authority, once all the developments in the area are complete, runoff into the brook will be about 44% more compared with the pre-development baseline. The particular shape of this brook means that when it is overwhelmed with too much water, too quickly, it creates a second river – straight into people’s homes.View image in fullscreenThe brook near Christine’s home in Trowell, Nottinghamshire. She says flooding is caused by water runoff due to new houses being built at the top of her road.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianPlanning rules should prevent any new building developments from increasing flood risks, but there is a small, but not inconsequential, loophole that is preventing this. Developments are assessed one at a time and often done in phases. Taken on its own, a project may be viable, but when the impact of multiple developments is added up, this can have disastrous consequences for communities. Every time we build we not only add more runoff, but we also build on the very land that acts as a natural flood protection: tarmac and concrete don’t soak up water, whereas soil does.Repeated risk of flooding is making Christine, Jackie and Rhona’s properties unsellable. Like all homeowners, they are required to inform buyers of any flooding in the previous five years, and unsurprisingly this has affected the sales of their homes. Jackie would like to move in order to be closer to her soon to be born grandchild, but looking at sales of similar properties in her area, she may have to drop the price significantly and use her pension money to help her move. Her experience tracks with larger trends: a study fromBayes Business Schoolsuggests that homes at risk of flooding are sold for between 8% and 32% lower than average compared with non-affected properties.Even when sellers are able to find buyers, some lenders, such asNationwide, may no longer provide mortgages. The government has stepped in to cover the flood-risk element of home insurance until 2039 so that customers do not see a spike in premiums. However, the end date for this scheme and the fact that it doesn’t cover houses built after 2009 means that mortgage lenders do not want to fund homes that will lose value and be sold at a loss if repossession occurs when a mortgage is defaulted.Flooded and forgotten: the UK’s waters are rising and we’re being kept in the dark | John HarrisRead moreThis is a dynamic that may become worse as flood risk encroaches on more of the UK’s housing stock. Labour’s “build, baby, build” housing policy means more homes are being built ongreen beltland, meaning less natural flood defences, more runoff and increased flood risk for existing homes. Even worse, Guardian analysis has predicted that more than100,000 of these new homescould be built on the highest-risk flood zones in England. At the same time,extreme weather isincreasing because of climate breakdown and theEnvironment Agency datasays 6.3m properties, residential homes and businesses are in areas at risk of flooding, rising to 8m by 2050.All this points to a potential risk for the financial sector. As long as the government is covering flood risk, theBank of Englandsees little threat to financial stability from flooding, but after the current scheme ends the outlook may look very different as negative equity and mortgage defaults lead to banks having reduced collateral and capital.Of course, all of this may be needless worry if the government remains an insurer of last resort. But that is dependent on what politicians decide in 2039. Meanwhile, Christine, Jackie and Rhona will spend their days at the mercy of the weather forecast.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsFloodingOpinionExtreme weatherEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Now only fast food and fine dining are thrivingFri 2 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 14.02 ESTShareSpare a thought for the poor French restaurateur. Once the iconic image of a sybaritic nation that loved nothing more than a boozy meal out with friends or colleagues, the French restaurant isin deep crisis.Traditional restaurants are closing faster than you can shout “garçon!”, as eating habits change and the cost of living pinches.“It’s a catastrophe for our profession,” Franck Chaumès, president of the restaurant branch of the Union of Hospitality Trades and Industries (UMIH) said in a television interview recently. “Some 25 restaurants are going out of business every day.” The UMIHhas demanded– so far in vain – that the government ration the opening of new restaurants, in proportion to the local population, and license only professionals who are qualified in cooking and accounting.The only businesses that seem immune to the hollowing out of France’s hospitality sector are those providing haute cuisine at eye-watering prices to the super-rich and fast-food chains such as the ubiquitous McDonald’s, which does a roaring trade.The days when business, politics and diplomacy were transacted over lengthy wine-fuelled lunches are mostly gone. When I started as a reporter in Paris in 1978, there was no point calling a ministry or corporate press office between 1pm and 3pm, even in a crisis. Everyone wasà table. Nowadays, only parliamentarians perpetuate the gluttonous tradition.Changing lifestyles, rising wholesale food prices and perverse tax rules are driving ever-more restaurant owners to the wall, as ordinary French people struggle to make ends meet. Gen Z and millennials eat less, drink less alcohol and spend less time at the dining table. Add to that theinroads of home-deliveryservices such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats – often ferrying food prepared in “dark kitchens”, without a dining room attached – and it’s easy to see how old-fashioned restaurants are struggling to survive.“I used to serve 75 covers every lunchtime, and we had at least two home-cooked dishes of the day, with meat or fish and fresh vegetables,” says Alex Diril, who used to run a bar-restaurant in Paris’s fifth arrondissement, frequented by office workers, craftsmen and young people from nearby universities. “Things changed after the pandemic. Customers who used to eat out every day came maybe once or twice at the beginning of the week. You would offer people a fresh, healthyplat du jour, and mostly they wanted burgers and fries. As the wholesale cost of food rose, we couldn’t increase prices because of the competition from fast-food joints and sandwich places.”Despite the hard work put into serving freshly cooked food, the restaurant was losing money. Diril cut his losses and stopped serving food at the end of 2024. His bar-tobacco shop is just one of thousands of victims of a crisis that is changing the face of France.The Covid pandemic was a turning point in many ways. When restrictions eased, fewer than two-thirds of middle-class workers returned to the office full-time. Many continue to work from home at least part of the week, and some take a lunchbox or grab a sandwich on the fly when they do go to the office.Tax and employment ruleshave compounded restaurateurs’ woes. VAT is charged at 5.5% on takeaway meals, but 10% on eat-in dining. Moreover, since Covid the luncheon vouchers that many French workers receive as part of their pay can be spent on food in supermarkets, not just in restaurants. That has dealt a body blow to lunchtime dining.The advent of online shopping, coupled with restrictions on driving and parking in urban centres has also hit the restaurant business hard.Statistically, the French have long spentmore time eating and drinkingthan other comparable countries: two hours and 13 minutes on average per day, according to a 2015 study, compared to one hour and 18 minutes in the UK, and barely an hour in the US. But habits have changed since then, influenced by US fast-food culture as well as healthier eating. Young people are as likely to go to the gym as to a restaurant during their lunch break.The 35-hourworking week, introduced in France in 1998, forced many small restaurants with kitchen staff to reduce their opening hours. Try getting served in a provincial restaurant after 1.30pm and you are likely to encounter a Gallic shrug and a curt “la cuisine est fermée” (the kitchen’s closed), if not a surly “non, mais vous avez vu l’heure?” (haven’t you seen the time?). Serving staff are also increasingly hard to find. Since the pandemic, fewer French people want to work the unsocial evening and weekend hours on which restaurants depend.Ironically, while the British government subsidised its citizens to “eat out to help out” – at the risk of spreading contagion – the French government showered restaurateurs with money tostay shutduring the Covid lockdowns. While other businesses received interest-free loans to ease their cashflow, restaurants got outright grants. “I’d never seen so much money. We couldn’t believe our eyes,” says Martine David, who ran a family restaurant in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in southern France. There was a six-month boom when lockdown was lifted. French people regained their freedom and splurged pent-up savings on a meal out. But business never really returned to normal after the pandemic.Restaurateurs now face a choice between reheating mass-produced pre-cooked frozen food from wholesalers to cut costs, or trying to attract customers who care about healthy eating with a short menu of locally sourced produce cooked to order, which has a higher labour cost. Sadly, the former are faring better than the latter.Bon appetit!Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionFoodRestaurantsFast foodEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

What’s the excuse  so close to breakfast?Fri 2 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 12.04 ESTShareFirst and foremost, let me say: I love love. I’m in love – I’m happily married with two boys. I’m surrounded by love, because most of my friends and family are in long-term relationships and have kids of their own. Heck, I even love it when strangers find love. Since its inception, I have watched every episode ofPop the Balloon or Find Love– a US reality dating show hosted by Arlette Amuli. While it’s entertaining observing how treacherous the dating market is, I’m more thrilled when two people match and commence their own love journey.However, for all my appreciation of love, public displays of affection (PDAs) on the morning commute should be punishable by prison. I’m talking hugging, kissing, even sitting on each other’s laps – all of the above are abominable to watch. In my dictatorship, those who committed such crimes would be locked up without due process. The British tonguing police (BTP) would ensure that perpetrators were swiftly caught.They would not pass go, they would not collect £200. They would go directly to jail.Don’t get me wrong: I understand indulging in a little affection in the evenings and on weekends after a night out. You’ve had a few drinks, you’re feeling uninhibited, and that may manifest in an embrace and a kiss on your bus or train journey home. I get it. I love love. If it doesn’t become a show – do your thing. But what’s the excuse for feeling randy at eight o’clock on a Tuesday morning?Nothing should arouse you at that time. If anything, if you are stimulated, work is the last place you should be heading. I don’t see how you can be productive under the influence of excessive titillation. That sort of behaviour should be viewed in the same light as drink and drugs: stay home, relieve yourself fully from its effects and then, only once you’ve recovered, return to work. That’s one way to spare us from your early morning lip-locking.I’m telling you, I’m happy for you: love who you love.

The first half of the year was properly parched as President Trump’s tariff agenda upset everything: fundraisings from flotations, or initial public offerings (IPOs), were the lowest in a miserable run that started in 2022. But data from Dealogic show there was a notable pick-up in activity in the second half, albeit still billions away from that of 2021, the last strong year.The mini-revival will have come as a relief for both the London Stock Exchange and Rachel Reeves. For the former, the dearth of new listings – as opposed to fundraisings by companies already on the exchange – has become an embarrassment in recent years, especially after Londonfailed to land Arm Holdings in 2023. Meanwhile, the chancellor is trying to talk up the joys (and superior returns over cash) for long-term investors in equities, a task that is easier when there is a steady buzz of new arrivals.Not all of 2025’s newcomers can be described as household names. The largest IPO was the Texas-based data centre real estate group Fermi – and that was a dual listing with the US Nasdaq exchange. Better-known UK names included the£1.2bn tinned tuna maker Princes Group, which raised £400m, and the specialist lender Shawbrook.Naturally, the LSE is keen to promote the idea that a turning point was passed. “The momentum this year is very much a sign of what is to come, with many companies actively preparing for a listing in London next year,” argues the chief executive, Julia Hoggett.She is probably correct. Share prices are high, which encourages owners to cash in a few chips. And the merry-go-round of private equity funds selling assets to each other may have reached its natural limit; the stock market, the more traditional venue for exits, looks relatively more attractive.Graph showing UK IPO volume per half year since 2021The most important early IPO of 2026 should be the Oslo-based Visma, one of Europe’s biggest software companies, with 17,500 employees. Londonfirst needs to be selected as the venue– Stockholm has been making a late challenge – but investment banking advisers are in place in the form of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and UBS. Visma has been backed by the UK-based private equity company Hg Capital for almost two decades. It is thought to be worth at least €20bn (£17.5bn), more than enough to enter the Footsie.Other possibilities include the Bristol-based veterinary group IVC Evidensia, whose route is clearer now that the Competition and Markets Authority hasissued its preliminary report on the sector. It operates from 2,700 sites in 19 countries, employing about 39,000 people, and the UK is its biggest single market. The company is owned by a private equity consortium led by EQT. Again, its likely valuation would make the cut for the FTSE 100.Other names include theRAC roadside recovery business(and possibly the AA too), the combinedWaterstones and Barnes & Noble bookshop chains, fintech payments platform Ebury and online travel agent Loveholidays.A market downturn would probably stall progress, but the London IPO pipeline looks in better shape than it has done for years. “We have seen confidence gradually grow with IPO issuers, who have been encouraged by the activity that has come to market,” says Brian Hanratty of the broker Peel Hunt.But London definitely needs an injection of freshness. Amid the mini-pick-upin 2025, Wise, the payments firm,announced a switch of its primary listing to the US. Meanwhile, the natural churn on takeovers and delistings continued to reduce the ranks of public companies; at the end of November, there were 930 companies with a main market listing in London, down from 972 at the start of the year.Reeves, in herNovember budget, announced a three-year post-IPO stamp duty holiday for firms listing in London. That modest giveaway on the levy on share purchases is probably only a minor consideration for companies and their backers. But it would still be politically useful for her if the IPO market comes to life at the same time. An improvement is overdue – and needs to last longer than six months.The subheading of this article was amended on 2 January 2026 to remove an incorrect description of the payments firm Wise as Norwegian.Explore more on these topicsLondon Stock ExchangeNils Pratley on financeStock marketsIPOsRachel ReevesEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

They also signal the state’s ongoing roleFri 2 Jan 2026 13.05 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 13.15 ESTShareThe outcomes for children who grow up in care are shocking. A vital part of the welfare state, which exists to promote the safety and wellbeing of highly vulnerable young people, is falling short in health, education and employment terms. They have a62% higher chanceof dying before the age of 75 than their peers, and are four times as likely to have a criminal conviction or caution. While the number of children in the care system in England has fallen from its all-time high of 83,750 in 2023, the latest figure of81,770 in Marchlast year is still 17.7% higher than a decade ago.A recently announced raft of reforms, including free prescriptions for care leavers, will not solve all of the problems. The dire financial position of many councils, and depleted state of local services, have a particularly damaging impact on the lives of those who rely most on the state. One survey last year found that therecruitment and retention of social workerswas the biggest workforce challenge that English councils face. There is also ashortage of foster carers, with a consultation on expanding eligibility expected to open soon. Since children’s social care is devolved, none of the changes being discussed will affectScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland, where the most recent figures show that a further 23,230 children are looked after by the state.These are important caveats. Eye-catching initiatives launched during the holidays must not distract from deeply entrenched shortcomings in public services. But thenew entitlement to free prescriptions, dentistry and eye care for care leavers in England up to the age of 25 should be welcomed all the same. First, because the removal of charges ought to make it easier for young adults to access treatment. Second, because it represents an acknowledgment of the state’s ongoing responsibility to young people who have been removed from their birth families, or who have arrived in the UK unaccompanied, beyond their 18th birthdays. Other new measures include a pilot scheme to provide dedicated mental health support and internships in the NHS.At a time when more young people are living with parents into adulthood, partly due to the higher cost of living and lack of affordable housing, this is a necessary correction. The lack of post-18 support for care leavers places them at a huge disadvantage when compared with their peers, and is one reason why only a small proportion (about 14%) manage toaccess higher education. This is an area in which England could learn from Scotland, where the number of care leavers going to university was increased by bursaries. New findings from the science of ageing are also relevant, with onerecent studyproposing that the “adolescent” phase of brain development lasts until the age of 32.Josh MacAlister, who wrote areport on children’s social care for the Conservatives, is now a children’s minister in Bridget Phillipson’s education department. He should use his position to push through further changes, including an overall rebalancing of the children’s social care sector in favour of public and non-profit provision. In the meantime, he and his colleagues must ensure that young care leavers are aware of their new entitlements. In recent years, UK governments have slowly improved support tohelp care leaversto make the transition to adulthood. These latest changes must now be built on.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Israel’s ban on international NGOs will worsen this disasterFri 2 Jan 2026 13.07 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 13.15 ESTShareAsGazaenters the bleakest period of winter, children are dying of hypothermia,drowning in flooded campsandburning to deathas their families try to cook in flimsy tents. Israel destroyed nine out of 10 homes over more than two years of war. Camped amid the ruins, Palestinians struggle againststrong winds, heavy rain and freezing temperatures. Aid deliveries resumed following the ceasefire, staving off the famine that had taken hold in parts of the territory, but remain wholly insufficient: 1.6 million people face acute food insecurity. The sanitation infrastructure has collapsed.The UK, Canada, Japan, France and six other nations havejointly warnedthat the situation is catastrophic. Yet Israel is now deepening one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. On Tuesday, it announced that it is deregistering37 NGOs active in Gaza. They must cease all operations there by 1 March unless they meet its new “security and transparency standards” – including by disclosing the personal details of staff. Many of the listed groups are among the best-regarded in their field, including Oxfam, Médecins Sans Frontières and the Norwegian Refugee Council.Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, was right to describe this as outrageous – and as part of a pattern of unlawful restrictions on humanitarian access. Israeli NGOs havewarnedthat it breaks the principles of independence and neutrality for humanitarian organisations.Israel says that the measures are necessary to prevent NGOs employing staff with links to extremist groups. It has repeatedly claimed that Hamas has infiltrated aid organisations and exploited international aid, while providing little evidence. Given the many relief workers arbitrarily detained and killed since the war began, the demand for staff lists has prompted alarm.Israelhas reportedly refused requests for meetings on the issue.Meanwhile, as Israel bars life-saving supplies such as tent poles and generators from humanitarian shipments, claiming they could be exploited for military purposes, itallows tradersto bring such items into the territory. While ordinary Palestinians suffer, players inside and outside the territory profit financially and politically. US officers in Israel have reportedly urged that key items, including tent poles, be removed from the blacklist – without success.In Washington, there appears to begrowing frustrationat Benjamin Netanyahu’s attempts to stall the peace process. Yet while Donald Trump said he wanted to move to the second phase as quickly as possible when he met the Israeli prime minister on Monday – and warned there would be “hell to pay” if Hamas did not disarm very rapidly – he appeared relaxed about Israel’s reluctance to withdraw from the half of Gaza that it controls.Far from “[living] up to the plan, 100%”, as Mr Trump claimed, it is clear that Israel is not complying with a deal that Palestinians greeted with tentative relief only as the alternative to continued war. If he wants to be lauded as a dealmaker, he should enforce it. Ensuring relief to those in desperate conditions is not an act of munificence subject to inclination, nor a clause for negotiation. It is not merely what basic humanity and decency require;international law demandsthat the parties to conflict facilitate aid. Israel’s allies were slowly pushed into acknowledging and challenging the carnage in Gaza. They must not drag their feet again. It is not bad weather but bad faith that is the greatest threat to those now struggling to survive.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If it had been published in Greek, contemporary critics would have hailed it as comparable with Aeschylus, since the structure is in three, not two, parts – like a classical Greek tragedy, the revenge/resolution comes at the end.The parallels include Lockwood and Nelly Dean narrating most of the story, much as a Greek chorus would do; most (though not all) of the violence takes place offstage; the setting is otherworldly at times, but relatable to the audience; the wellspring is Heathcliff and Cathy declaring their unity at a very young age and claiming to be damned for it. Which they are, thus tempting fate.The whole should be filmed as a trilogy – novels of the 19th century were often referred to as a three‑volume novel, as that was the convention even for gothic horror.John StarbuckLepton, West YorkshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

He is due to appear in court on 20 January.The Federal Road Safety Corps inNigeriasaid they believed the vehicle was travelling “beyond the legally prescribed speed limit”.Kayode was driving the former world heavyweight boxing champion, Joshua, 36, his personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, on 29 December on a busy highway linking Lagos and Ibadan in south-west Nigeria.The Lexus SUV was travelling at high speed when the tyre on the passenger side burst while trying to overtake a vehicle. The Lexus crashed into a stationary lorry carrying soya beans that was illegally parked on the hard shoulder of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, 30 miles from Lagos. Ayodele and Ghami, both 36, died at the scene.The 46-year-old driver is a longstanding member of the boxer’s team, and was granted bail of 5m naira (£2,580), but will remain in custody until he meets bail conditions.‘Stay strong, champion’: boxing world offers condolences to Anthony JoshuaRead moreThe driver and Joshua survived with minor injuries, but Kayode was taken to the Lagoon hospital in Ikoyi and kept under observation for two days. After the crash, Joshua and his mother paid their respects to the boxer’s friends at the funeral home.The accident occurred 10 days after the former world champion celebrated hisvictory against the YouTuber Jake Paul in the US. Prior to the crash, Joshua was believed to be preparing to return to the boxing ring early this year.After the crash, the Ogun state government said in a statement: “Anthony Joshua and another passenger were immediately evacuated to a specialised medical facility in Lagos.“Following comprehensive clinical assessments, doctors have confirmed that both patients are stable and do not require any emergency medical intervention at this time. A full medical team has been assembled and will continue to monitor them closely.”Explore more on these topicsAnthony JoshuaNigeriaAfricaBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

This isn’t leadership. It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire,” the foreign ministry said in apost on X.Mamdani revoked an Adams-era order that adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which the previous administration said included “demonizingIsraeland holding it to double standards as forms of contemporary antisemitism”.Asked about the criticism by a reporter from the Forward, a Jewish newspaper that has chronicled the experiences of Jews in the United States since 1897,Mamdani acknowledged the concernsof a number of Jewish organizations about dropping that definition, but pledged that “protecting Jewish New Yorkers is going to be a focus of my administration”.“My administration will also be marked by a city government that will be relentless in its efforts to combat hate and division, and we will showcase that by fighting hate across the city, and that includes fighting the scourge of antisemitism, by actually funding hate crime prevention, by celebrating our neighbors, and by practicing a politics of universality,” the new mayor said.In a statement, theNew Yorkchapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair-NY) said it welcomed the revocation of the “controversial and overly broad” IHRA definition of “antisemitism” that it said is “often used to censor criticism of the Israeli government’s racism and crimes against humanity”.I drafted the definition of antisemitism. Rightwing Jews are weaponizing it | Kenneth SternRead more“Mayor Adams’ order would have enshrined the controversial IHRA definition of antisemitism even though its author has said it was never meant for government use and though the overly-broad definition declares any recognition of the Israeli government’s racism or disagreement with Zionism as antisemitic,” the statement read. “The order would have also unconstitutionally limited boycotts against only Israel.”The council called Adams’s order an “unconstitutional, Israel First attack on free speech [that] should have never been issued in the first place. We applaud Mayor Mamdani for immediately overturning it.”Israel’s response came hours after Mamdani issued an order to rescind all executive orders that Adams issued after he was indicted on federal corruption charges in 2024 – charges that were later, controversially, dropped.Mamdani’s office said the decision was to ensure “a fresh start for the incoming administration”.One of Adams’s orders, now revoked,includedprohibiting city officials overseeing the city pension system from making decisions in line with the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, which Mamdani has said he supports.Asecond orderdirected the New York police commissioner, currently Jessica Tisch, to evaluate proposals for regulating protest activity occurring close to houses of worship. It came after demonstrations outside an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event promoting immigration to Israel sparked claims of antisemitism.“New York City has always been this nation’s melting pot, but too often, over the last few years, we’ve seen those of Jewish ancestry be singled out and targeted,” Adams said last month, adding that the measures were aimed to “protect New Yorkers’ tax dollars and protect their right to practice their religion without harassment”.The measures were seen as an effort to curb Mamdani, who has vowed to govern as a democratic socialist, and whose past comments about Israel, including a vow to divest New York from Israeli government bonds, have sparked some opposition.But in his address on Thursday, Mamdani was careful to reassure Jewish New Yorkers, saying: “Where else could a Muslim kid like me grow up eating bagels and lox?”Mamdani pledges ‘new era’ for New York and vows to govern ‘audaciously’Read moreHe was sworn in on the Qur’an by a Jewish New Yorker, Vermont senatorBernie Sanders. Also in attendance were Jewish religious leaders who had not endorsed Mamdani during his campaign.“I know there are some who view this administration with distrust or disdain, or who see politics as permanently broken,” Mamdani said. “And while only action can change minds, I promise you this: if you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor. Regardless of whether we agree, I will protect you, celebrate with you, mourn alongside you, and never, not for a second, hide from you.”After issuing his first set of executive orders, Mamdani said he would keep open the recently created office to combat antisemitism. “That is an issue that we take very seriously,” he told reporters.William Daroff, the CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish organizations, called Mamdani’s rescinding of Adams’s order on the definition of antisemitism “a troubling indicator of the direction in which he is leading the city, just one day at the helm”.Daroff told theliberal-leaning Forwardthat the move “diminishes New York City’s ability to recognize and respond to antisemitism at a time when incidents continue to rise”.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniIsraelAntisemitismMiddle East and north AfricaNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

Spencer reportedly ordered medication online to end her pregnancy, then buried the remains of her pregnancy in her backyard.It is not clear how far along Spencer’s pregnancy was at the time of her alleged abortion, although police described the fetus as “developed”, the Lexington Herald Leaderreported.Spencer was booked into a jail in Beattyville,Kentucky, on Thursday, jail records show. She remained at the jail as of Friday evening.Abortion may no longer be a top priority for Democratic voters ahead of 2026 midterms, polls showRead moreKentuckybansdoctors from performing abortions any time after conception. However,like the vast majority of states, Kentucky does not outlaw people from inducing – or “self-managing” – their own abortions. Medical experts also widely agree that it is safe to self-manage an abortion using pills in the first trimester of pregnancy.Ordering abortion pills online has become increasingly common since the US supreme court overturnedRoe v Wadeand unleashed awaveof state-level abortion bans in 2022. By the end of 2024, one in four abortions involvedproviders who consulted with patients onlineand thenmailed themabortion pills. Tens of thousands of these abortions took place in states with abortion bans, according todatafrom the research group #WeCount.Still, women have repeatedlyfaced criminal consequencesfor their pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriages. In the two years after Roe fell, 412 people were prosecuted for pregnancy-related crimes, researchers at the reproductive justice group Pregnancy Justicefound.Sixteen of those prosecutions involved homicide charges, while seven involved what researchers called “conduct concerning improper conduct with regard to birth or death”. It is not clear how many cases may have been sparked by authorities’ suspicions that the defendant obtained an abortion, since just nine cases included charges related to undergoing, attempting or researching an abortion.Abortion rights advocates see efforts to criminalize pregnancy outcomes as part of an overarching campaign to establish “fetal personhood”, a legal doctrine that endows embryos and fetuses with full legal rights and protections – including to the point that a fetus’s rights can compete with those of the woman carrying it.Court allows White House to end Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood in 22 statesRead more“The idea that the fetus can be a person and a victim of a crime is being wielded in significant ways when there’s a pregnancy loss,” Wendy Bach, a University of Tennessee law professor,toldthe Guardian in 2024. “So rather than meeting a pregnancy loss with care, with support, with an acknowledgement for the often tragic life circumstances that that involves – we are meeting it with criminal suspicion, with criminal investigation and with prosecution.”Police in Georgiaarrested one womanafter she was found bleeding and unconscious after a miscarriage.Another woman, in Ohio, was arrested after she miscarried into a toilet. Both cases were ultimately dropped.Kentucky police reportedly got involved in Spencer’s case after Spencer talked about her pregnancy to clinic staffers. It is often healthcare workers who tip off the police in cases in which people are criminalized for pregnancy outcomes: out of 412 such cases uncovered by Pregnancy Justice, 264 involved information that had been disclosed in a medical setting.An individual who answered the phone at the Kentucky state police headquarters said that, due to the recent holidays, no one was available to comment on Spencer’s case. A jail official said Spencer had been advised by her attorney not to speak to the media or law enforcement. Spencer’s attorney was not immediately available to speak.Explore more on these topicsKentuckyAbortionReproductive rightsWomen's healthRoe v WadeWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Once you would have heard the chirrup of the stonechat, the chirp of the greater spotted woodpecker or the song of the skylark. Today, the auditory power of one bird dominates.The bright green ring-necked parakeet increased 25-fold from 1994-2023 in the UK. They are still mainly based in the skies, parks, and woodlands around London and suburban areas in the south east, but in recent years they have made their way to northern cities including Manchester and Newcastle.Richmond Park, with its rolling hectares, has become a perfect habitat for the birds, with hundreds of ancient trees providing the deep holes in the trunks that parakeets prefer to nest in, and plenty of fruits, berries, buds, and flowers to feed on.The sound of parakeets recorded in Richmond ParkSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/12/16/20s_clip_1.mp300:00:0000:00:20Parakeets first appeared in the UK in the late 1960s after pet birds, which originated from the Indian subcontinent and Africa, were released or escaped. Climate impacts have helped increase their numbers, and today theBritish Trust for Ornithologyconservatively puts the population at more than 30,000 birds, in 15,000 breeding pairs, plus an unspecified number of non-breeding individuals.The auditory dominance is hard to escape, but less clear is what impact this invasive species is having onalready threatenednative birds such as starlings, song thrush and lesser spotted woodpeckers, as well as bats, in the protected national nature reserve and elsewhere across the UK.Paddy McCleave, who works with the Songbird Survival organisation, says the volume of UK-based research on the impact of ring-necked parakeets is limited and needs to be updated. However, their rapid expansion has sparked concern among scientists and conservationists.“One of the impacts of these birds is the competition they create for our native birds. Their presence, as woodpecker-sized birds, at garden feeders can cause alarm among native birds, subsequently reducing foraging behaviour and potentially increasing stress.”In other European countries there is some evidence that they have a negative impact on other species. In 2010Belgian scientistslooked at the parakeets’ impact on the nuthatch, a small grey and rust coloured bird which, like the parakeet, lives in mature woodlands, parks and large gardens with old trees, using their cavities for nesting and abundant food, and found thata third of the population of nuthatches may be at risk from the increase in parakeet numbers.However, David Noble, of the British Trust for Ornithology, says that when they repeated the Belgian research in 2011 they found no evidence of a significant impact through competition on nuthatch populations or those of any other cavity-nesting species.View image in fullscreenDavid Noble of BTO talks about the parakeets in Richmond Park, which have been a feature for some years.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianSeven years ago in Spain, where populations of parakeets have also increased massively across some of the biggest cities,researchers investigating the 81% decline in numbersof the noctule bat in a park in Seville – the largest colony in Europe – observed parakeets chasing the much smaller bats out of their nests.The researchers also found 20 dead and two injured noctules under nest sites, some with beak cuts on their muscle and bones.Authorities are looking at what action can be taken. In the UK culling has been considered but never carried out because of the risk of public controversy. The most recent risk assessment drawn up by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was in 2011 and warned “the potential for impact on economic activities, (agriculture) and native fauna is high”.The birds, the risk assessment found, could be a threat to other species, could spread disease, have caused significant damage to vineyards, and have the potential to raid crops and orchards in the UK.At that point, the population of parakeets was around 5000. Uncontrolled, the parakeet population has multiplied to 30,000 birds in the UK, and any control methods are likely to be far more costly, difficult and, potentially, more controversial.In Madrid officials are runninga humane slaughter programmeto control large numbers of parakeets after their numbers reached 13,000 in 2019.The Spanish cull is being carried out through a variety of measures including shooting with air rifles, using nets and traps, and sterilising eggs in nests.Defra officials have acted in the past to control another species of parakeets, the monk, a native of South America, after the birds appeared in large numbers on the Isle of Dogs in London 24 years ago. Officials cited the threat the birds posed to power lines as a reason for instituting control measures.Amy Leedale, lecturer in behavioural ecology at the University of Salford, said it was too early to say whether parakeets posed the same threat in the UK as has been suggested in other European countries.“To understand adaptation and impacts on native species we do need long-term field data to build a complete picture and understand what is going on,” said Leedale. “It is not something you can understand in just a year of field work.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentBirdsAnimalsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

All of the top 10 warmest years have happened in the past two decades.With a mean temperature of 10.09C, 2025 now tops the list, with 2022 and 2023 the second and third warmest years since records began in 1884. It was only the second time since the 19th century that the mean temperature exceeded 10C.UK temperatures chart 1884-2025The Met Office’s head of climate attribution, Dr Mark McCarthy, said: “2025 was the warmest year on record for the UK, surpassing the previous record set in 2022, in a series dating back to 1884. We’re increasingly seeing UK temperatures break new ground in our changing climate, as demonstrated by a new highest UK mean temperature record just three years after the last record.“This very warm year is in line with expected consequences of human-induced climate change. Although it doesn’t mean every year will be the warmest on record, it is clear from our weather observations and climate models that human-induced global warming is impacting the UK’s climate.”Spring and summer 2025 were warm with multiple heatwaves, though the record hottest day is still 19 July 2022, when temperatures exceeded 40C.The Met Office scientist Dr Emily Carlisle said: “While many will remember the long warm spring and summer of 2025, what has been noteworthy this year has been the consistent heat throughout the year, with every month except January and September warmer than average.“In the six months from March to August, every month was at least 1C above the 1991-2020 average. This resulted in the warmest spring and the warmest summer we have seen in this series.“Meteorologically, the warmth has been driven largely by persistent high-pressure systems bringing prolonged dry, sunny conditions, alongside above-average sea temperatures around the UK. These factors have combined to keep temperatures consistently higher than normal for much of the year.”2025 has also become the sunniest year in records dating back to 1910, with 1,648.5 hours of sunshine recorded across the UK – 61.4 hours more than the previous record set in 2003.2025 sunshine hours UK chartThe higher than average sunshine hours boosted the UK’s solar farms. More than 6% of Britain’s annual energy requirements were met by solar this year, which is a more than 50% increase on recent years.Overall rainfall totals were below average and some areas saw record low levels of rain.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherMet OfficeClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

This year’s hunt started on Thursday and runs until Sunday.In 2025, citizen scientists recorded 310 native plant species in flower, which the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) said far exceeded the 10 species they would typically expect for this time of year. Including non-native species, they counted 646 flowering species.Kevin Walker, a scientist at BSBI, said it was a “visible signal” of climate change that people could see in their own gardens.“This new analysis shows a very clear link between rising temperatures and impacts on our plant species,” said Walker. “This is yet further evidence that climate change is affecting our wildlife indiscriminately.”Hot summer and damp autumn cause UK boom in destructive honey fungusRead moreEarly results for 2026 show common wildflowers such as daisies and dandelions on the list of native plants unexpectedly in bloom. The non-native list, which includes plants brought to Britain before the 16th century, contains species such as Mexican fleabane and white and red dead-nettles.Fossil fuel pollution has heated the planet by an average of about 1.4C above preindustrial levels, worsening weather extremes and disrupting habitats. Last week, the Met Office said2025 was likely to be the UK’s hottest year on record.Debbie Hemming, a vegetation expert at the Met Office, said it was “tangible evidence” that climate breakdown was directly influencing the world around us.“These findings underscore how rising temperatures and increasing climate extreme events are shifting the natural cycles of our plants and wildlife,” she said.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisPlantsWild flowersFossil fuelsWildlifenewsShareReuse this content"

New-builds being built from 2027 without the latest cost-saving net zero tech may mean we’re not making the most of our own power, increasing bills and meaning we need more gas from abroad.”The failure to mandate the installation of batteries, which have fallen dramatically in price, will reduce the efficiency savings for homeowners. Battery storage would cost an estimated £2,000 to £5,000 for each new home but result in longterm savings on energy bills. According toresearch last year by the MCS Foundation charity, the savings on an average three-bedroom, semi-detached home from having a heat pump, solar panels and batteries would amount to roughly £1,350 a year.View image in fullscreenHeat pumps are still expected to be mandatory in all new-build homes in England as part of the future homes standard.Photograph: JulPo/GettyBuildingthe 1.5m new homes Labour has promisedwithout batteries will also cut off potential advantages to the UK’s electricity grid. A large reserve of battery storage with smart meters could help make the grid more efficient, smoothing out supply and demand, which is particularly important when much more power is expected to come from intermittent sun and wind.Housebuilders have been lobbying against the inclusion of batteries, which would entail an upfront cost to the developer, though they would save money for homeowners. Rhodri Williams, the technical director at the Home Builders Federation, said at this stage builders preferred alternatives such as “switch valves” or using excess solar power to heat water, neither of which stores electrical energy and does not help the grid.He said: “Housebuilders have embraced every step of the journey towards zero carbon housing, including the FHS, from the very beginning. As a result, new-build homes emit a third of the carbon on average of equivalent-sized older properties, saving residents of new homes thousands of pounds in energy bills.”Jan Rosenow, a professor of energy at Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, said failing to include batteries was a “missed opportunity … installing a battery at the point of construction is cheaper and less disruptive than retrofitting later”.He added: “Housing developers in this country have atrack record of pushing back against requirementsthat enhance energy performance of homes. We have seen this withinsulation, heat pumps and other technologies. Ultimately, it will be to thedetriment of the homebuyer.”Ministers ‘break word’ on protecting nature after weakening biodiversity planning ruleRead moreGarry Felgate, the chief executive of the MCS Foundation, said the future homes standard “could be a gamechanger”, resulting in savings of more than £1,000 a year on energy bills even without batteries, and generating as much electricity for the UK as two nuclear power stations.Ministers are expected to announce the “warm homes plan” at the same time as the future homes standard, setting outhow to insulate England’s draughty housing.Felgate said the government should also publish clearer proposals on how to move the UK away from dependency on gas for heating. “It is clear that renewables are the future for powering our homes,” he said. “The government must now set out plans to phase out fossil fuel boilers in existing homes and decommission the gas grid, to provide further confidence to the renewables sector and the public.”A spokesperson for the Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government said: “Our future homes standard is in development and will be published early next year [2026]. This will ensure our new homes are warmer and more affordable and help us to meet our net zero target by 2050.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentConstruction industryLabourGreenhouse gas emissionsHousingSolar powerHeat pumpsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sadly, he was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed. The coroner has been informed, and the death is not being treated as suspicious.”The death comes after the disappearance of Matthew Upham, 63, and another man during a Christmas Day swim in the Devon seaside townof Budleigh Salterton. Upham and the other man, aged in his 40s, reportedly went missing after entering the water to help a woman in difficulty.A number of people were rescued from the stormy waters at Budleigh Salterton and checked by paramedics or taken to hospital as a precaution, but the two men were not found, Devon and Cornwall police said.The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has issued advice that the effects of cold water shock, combined with weather conditions, pose a risk to anyone entering water that is 15C or below, especially at a time of year when the average sea temperature around the UK and Ireland is 6C to 10C.Gareth Morrison, the head of water safety for the RNLI, said: “We know this time of year many people take part in festive and new year dips, or continue to take part in regular winter swims. We are urging anyone entering the water to be aware of the dangers, check sea conditions carefully and to understand their own limitations.“With the sea temperatures still dropping and reaching their coldest around March, the effects of cold water, combined with weather conditions and any personal health issues, should be taken seriously before venturing in. If it’s your first time in open water, we’d recommend you speak to your GP first, particularly for those with cardiac or underlying health conditions.”Explore more on these topicsBrightonnewsShareReuse this content"

He had a cardiorespiratory arrest on his way to hospital a week after undergoing a non-therapeutic circumcision, an inquest at westLondoncoroner’s court found in October.In aprevention of future deaths reportpublished this week, the assistant coroner Anton van Dellen urged the government to take action to avoid similar tragedies.He wrote: “During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.”Mohamed was circumcised at 3pm on 12 February, by an individual who was recommended to his parents, the coroner’s report said. After the procedure, the wound appeared to be healing well, the inquest heard.But three or four days later he began showing symptoms of illness. When Mohamed’s health became worse on 19 February he was taken to Hillingdon hospital in an ambulance. In the ambulance he had a cardiorespiratory arrest and was pronounced dead later that day.In his report, Van Dellen expressed concern that any individual without training or continued professional development could conduct non-therapeutic circumcisions. He said he was also concerned that there was no system of accreditation or registrations for those who conduct circumcisions.Van Dellen noted his alarm that during circumcision rituals there was no requirement for infection control. And there was no duty of aftercare “including but not limited to dressing the wound, analgesia and/or worsening care advice”.He also highlighted the lack of record keeping by circumcisers, and the absence of any system of consent before circumcision.A jury inquest, which concluded on 8 October last year, found the medical cause of death to be an “invasive streptococcus pyogenes infection following male circumcision”.Van Dellen’s report has been sent to the Department ofHealthand Social Care, and to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.They had 56 days to respond, the coroner said.Copies of the report were also being sent to Mohamed’s mother and father, his maternal grandmother, his uncle and the London ambulance service.This article was amended on 2 January 2026 to clarify details about the cause of death.Explore more on these topicsCircumcisionChildren's healthHealthHealth & wellbeingLondonEnglandChildrenShareReuse this content"

Last winter, weekly flu numbers for England peaked at 5,408 patients.A total of 128 flu patients were in critical care beds in England last week, down from 117 the previous week.The UKHealthSecurity Agency has issued amber and yellow cold health alerts for England as temperatures fall below freezing, which could increase the pressure on hospitals.Prof Meghana Pandit, theNHSnational medical director, said: “It is welcome news to see a drop in the number of people being admitted to hospital with flu, thanks in part to the extraordinary efforts of NHS staff with more than half a million more people vaccinated against flu compared with the same period last year.“The NHS is far from complacent as temperatures drop, with this likely to increase pressures in the new year, and demand on services remaining high with NHS 111 services recording their second busiest day in two years on Saturday.”Health charities issued similar warnings about the cold snap. Ruth Goss, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “Cold temperatures can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and people with cardiovascular disease are also more at risk of serious illness if they get seasonal respiratory infections like flu.“It’s especially important that people living with heart conditions are well-prepared for the cold snap this winter by wrapping up warm and having their free flu jab.”Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “The plummeting temperatures, ice and snow we are now seeing are hazardous for older people, especially if they are living with serious health conditions or are generally frail. We urge anyone in this situation to take extra care of themselves and the general public to look out for any older person they know who could do with some extra support.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “In spite of all of the challenges the NHS faces this winter, the herculean efforts of NHS staff and our investment and modernisation mean that hospital bed occupancy is lower than this time last year and ambulance handover performance is improving.“But we still face intense pressures, and with this bitingly cold snap adding additional challenges it is more vital than ever those eligible get their flu jab and people only attend A&E in an emergency. Let’s all join NHS staff in doing everything we can to protect ourselves and our families through a difficult winter so NHS services are free for those who really need them.”An average of 284 hospital beds were filled each day last week by patients with diarrhoea and vomiting or norovirus-like symptoms. This was broadly unchanged on the previous week’s average of 285 patients and well below the figure of 427 patients a fortnight ago.The data has been published in the latest weekly snapshot of the performance of hospitals in England this winter.The NHS situation report also shows that 18% of patients arriving by ambulance at hospitals in England last week waited at least 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E teams. This was down from 22% the previous week and is the lowest figure so far this winter.Four per cent of ambulance handovers last week, or 3,359 patients, were delayed by more than an hour, down from 5% the previous week and also the lowest level so far this winter.Explore more on these topicsHospitalsNHSFluHealthEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Rescue crews arrived on foot but a helicopter airlift was inhibited due to “severe winds”. An air medic was eventually lowered down and confirmed Casanova was deceased, the department said.Two other hikers were also found dead, but have yet to be identified, and Casanova’s cause of death has not been determined by the county coroner.Three hikers found dead on southern California’s Mount BaldyRead moreMount Baldy, which rises more than 10,000ft and sits just east of Los Angeles, is a popular hiking spot that isalso known for treacherous conditions, particularly in the winter.Casanova was a student at Santa Clara University in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a statement his family made to KABC, and is described by his loved ones as “an avid sailor and outdoorsman”.“We are destroyed by the loss of our beloved Marcus. He was a graduate of Los Alamitos High, a freshman at Santa Clara University’s business school, and an avid sailor and outdoorsman … It is difficult to explain the pain and anguish we are going through and ask for privacy as we try to find our way,” the statement continues.Beginning on Thursday, the US Forest Service announced that seven trails on Mount Baldy, including the Devil’s Backbone,will be closeduntil next Wednesday for the safety of the public.The deaths occurred near where the actor Julian Sands died three years ago. Sands, who starred in A Room With a View and Leaving Las Vegas, was reported missing after setting off on a solo hike in January 2023. His body was found five months later.And in January 2023, the same month Sands went missing, another 15 hikers either got lost, were injured or died on the mountain.The same day Casanova and other hikers were found, the San Bernardino sheriff’s department announced that it had rescued two other hikers – two men, ages 18 and 31 – from another trail on Mount Baldy. One of the hikers was hurt after falling more than 100ft from the trail.In October, three people were also rescued near the same trail where the deceased hikers were found.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaLos AngelesMountaineeringMountainsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

He had led Saks Global since its formation in July 2024 and worked on shaping the firm’s digital transformation and strategy.“The Saks and Neiman Marcus merger has been a disaster,” said David Swartz, department store analyst at Morningstar, adding that luxury shoppers were shifting to Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom and brand-owned stores. “The whole luxury multibrand space has been struggling for years.“Products at Saks Fifth Avenue range from about $60 for cotton rib tank dresses to nearly $20,000 for designer dresses, with handbags typically priced between $100 and $38,280, according to information on its website.Incoming CEO Baker is the owner of real estate firm NRDC and has a long track record in retail and property. He previously chaired the Retail Opportunity Investments Corp and served as the president of the Saks Fifth Avenue Foundation, founded in 2017.The company said Metrick stepped down to pursue “new opportunities” and has not provided any further details.The company was looking to sell a minority stake in luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman to help cut debt, Reuters reported in September.Explore more on these topicsUS newsLuxury goods sectorBankruptcy and IVAsRetail industryShareReuse this content"

The move means drivers make a contract directly with their passengers – so they must charge any VAT due on the fare, while Uber only adds VAT to its commission.As most drivers are not thought to be making more than £90,000 in bookings a year, and therefore do not have to charge VAT, the majority of Uber fares outside London will avoid becoming more expensive, since the 20% sales tax will not apply.The new contracts do not relate to London, where the agency model is not allowed under Transport for London rules. As a result, Uber passengers in the capital will pay VAT on their fares.Uber’s change to the terms with its drivers has been expected since the budget announcement.At the time, Andrew Brem, Uber’s regional general manager for the UK,said: “The government’s action today to change the rules will mean higher prices for passengers in London, and less work for drivers, when people are already struggling with the cost of living … This decision also establishes the absurd situation where a trip in London will be taxed at a different rate than a trip anywhere else in the UK.”An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “Ending this use of a niche tax scheme by online minicab firms will both benefit everyday cabbies with a fairer tax system and raise money to help deliver the country’s priorities – cutting the cost of living, cutting waiting lists, and cutting debt and borrowing.”It did not say if Uber’s changes would affect its estimate of “protecting” £700m a year of receipts from the new policy.Explore more on these topicsUberTax and spendingPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

She has been banging the drum about the merits of investing over parking cash in the bank, and the FTSE 100’s achievements just go to show what’s possible when buying UK shares.“It also proves to cynics that the UK market is not stuck in the mud, and that the US stock market is not the only place to make money.”FTSE 100 graphicThe rally in London helped to lift the pan-European Stoxx 600 index to a record high on Friday morning, led by the mining and energy sectors.Global markets have risen sharply over the past 12 months, lifted by hopes of interest rate cuts from central banks, the artificial intelligence boom and a supportive economic backdrop.Although there was a wobble in the markets last April when Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on US trading partners, shares then recovered as trade war tensions have eased.The uncertainty created by Trump’s trade wars encouraged some investors to diversify away from the US, and into cheaper markets such as the UK during 2025.The FTSE 100 contains the 100 most valuable companies listed in London. It was created in 1984, when it started at 1,000 points – the lowest the index has ever reached is 986.9 in July 1984.The FTSE 100 has a strong international focus, containing mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Anglo American and the oil groups BP and Shell. It also contains the pharmaceuticals companies AstraZeneca and GSK, and the industrial groups Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, plus banks including Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC and NatWest, consumer-focused firms such as Unilever, the supermarkets Sainsbury’s and Tesco, and utilities such as power and water suppliers.Fresnillo was the best-performing stock on the FTSE 100 last year, up about 450% over the year as the gold and silver prices have jumped.Defence stocks also had a good year, with Babcock and Rolls-Royce doubling in value since the start of January 2025.Neil Wilson, an investor strategist at Saxo UK, said:“Defence names really stand out globally one year into President Trump’s presidency.“In Europe, his pressure on Nato members to take greater responsibility for their own defence spending has triggered a paradigm shift in how the continent views security, and that’s been reflected in the strength of European and UK defence stocks.”Wall Street analysts have predicted that global markets will rise during 2026 despite fears that AI company valuations are a bubble.A poll by the trading company eToro last month found that UK retail investors were optimistic about the year ahead, with 53% confident the current bull market would continue throughout 2026.Explore more on these topicsFTSEStock marketsLondon Stock ExchangeEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Electric carmakers have been forced to cut prices aggressively, and governments around the world have rolled back targets on the shift away from petrol.Tesla’s sales appear to have suffered in large part because of the withdrawal of electric vehicle (EV) subsidies by Donald Trump. The US president has also removed emissions regulations that incentivised electric car production. And Tesla also faced a backlash from some consumers afterMusk’s embrace of far-right politicsat the end of 2024.View image in fullscreenTesla’s sales last year were down by 9% compared with 2024.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APTesla’s deliveries slumped to 418,200 in the final quarter of the year, below the average forecasts of analysts. Sales for 2025 were down by 9% compared with 2024.An average compiled by Bloomberg had suggested that Tesla would deliver 441,000 vehicles during the quarter, but Tesla took the unusual step before the new year ofpublishing its own consensus estimate for the first time, apparently in an effort to guide investors that sales were expected to be lower.Tesla’s share price was down 1% on Friday, although they were down by 8% since Christmas Eve.Trump’s anti-EV policies came despite Musk donating more money than anyone else to the victorious 2024 presidential election campaign and briefly running an effort to cut government costs. Musk at first seemed to win support for EVs from Trump – and even an awkward photoshoot in a Tesla in front of the White House – but theyfell out dramatically in the summer.It was the second consecutive decline in annual sales for Tesla. Yet even as sales have fallen it remains by far the world’s most valuable carmaker, with shares valued at $1.4tn – more than the next 30 carmakers combined. Investors appear to be betting that Musk will lead Tesla to be a leading force in robotics and artificial intelligence.Musk has consistently claimed that autonomous capabilities will set Tesla apart from rivals, and it has started operating alimited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. However, it will still face competition on that front. Several Chinese carmakers and tech companies already have comparable technology, including an offering from BYD called “God’s Eye” that is now included even on its cheapest cars.BYD’s electric car sales rose by 28% during the year despite a weaker performance in December.BYD was founded in 1995 as a battery company byWang Chuanfu, who is often described as China’s equivalent to Musk. Its business already produced more cars overall than Tesla when counting hybrids.The Shenzhen-headquartered manufacturer hasovertaken Tesla during single quarters before. However, its battery electric production pulled away from its US rival in 2025, even as it faced intense competition from Chinese rivals.BYD recorded 4.55m car sales overall during 2025, although its sales of plug-in hybrids fell by 8% year on year to 2.29m. That came despite an uptick in sales of plug-in hybrids, combining a smaller battery with a petrol or diesel engine, in some markets from consumers worried about their ability to charge. BYD also more than doubled its sales of commercial vehicles, including electric buses and lorries, to 57,000.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryTeslaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsnewsShareReuse this content"

She decided to post online about the microaggressions she had endured while appearing in a play some years before, making peace with the fact that it could affect her chances at future roles, and shaking as she typed out the thread. A day passed, “and I just heard my phone goingding, ding, ding.I was convinced it was going to be backlash – but it was people sending their congratulations.” Ikumelo had been nominated for a Bafta for her short, Brain in Gear. “I felt like God was going: ‘Don’t worry.’ It was a beautiful moment.”She won that Baftaand has since scooped another. “When I won the first one, I was living in a small flat, and I felt like the [statuette] was judging me,” she laughs. “I was like, I might have to refurb or move. Now I have an office, so they’re in a very reasonable place.”You get the feeling she should keep a few shelves free. After flirting with TV roles in the US, in 2025 Ikumelo joined the writing and acting cast of NBC’s Office spinoff The Paper. Closer to home, she also shot another series of the show that scooped her the second of those aforementioned awards, for best female comedy performance – the riotous buddy cop comedyBlack Ops(she is still hopeful her brilliantly anxiety-inducing Brain in Gear will make it to a series).We meet just before an early screening of Black Ops, where the first two episodes prompt a stream of gasps and giggles from the audience. Afterwards, Ikumelo says to the crowd: “It’s kind of funny, isn’t it?!” If her rise seems swift, it has been underpinned by years of graft on stage (“Theatre was the guy who refused to marry me … we were living together for 20 years”) and now on screen. Her breakout TV role came in comedian Dane Baptiste’sSunny Da decade ago. Ikumelo then gave her funny bones a workout by writing and starring in another BBC series, the irreverent sketch showFamalam. She remembers the first time she was recognised in the wild. “I was in a play and I was having my little sad lunch outside,” she says. “Some random guy just goes: ‘You finished with that?’ And I went: ‘Oh – did you want it?’” It took her a second to realise he wasn’t asking for her leftovers, but rather riffing off the catchphrase uttered by her character Fat Sam, a chicken-obsessed schoolboy.Black Ops – co-created with Famalam alumnus Akemnji Ndifornyen and writers Joe Tucker and Lloyd Woolf – has seen her further hone her talent for creating and embodying hapless but endearing characters. A thrilling and very silly crime caper about two inexperienced, unsuitable police community support officers forced to go undercover, much of its magic comes from the chemistry between its leads, Dom (Ikumelo) and Kay, played by Hammed Animashaun (Pls Like, The Wheel of Time). “He’s energy on legs!” says Ikumelo. “I’m a bit more introverted, and I can be a curmudgeon. So he does his best work, but he also makes me domybest work.”View image in fullscreenChemistry … Dom (Ikumelo) and Kay (Hammed Animashaun) in the new series of Black Ops.Photograph: BBC/Ricky DarkoSeries one saw the duo thrown into the treacherous underworld of the Brightmarsh gang, presided over by Tevin (Ndifornyen). This time around, they have only gone and got themselves a promotion to MI5. Once again, the series cleverly highlights the gulf between their lives as intrepid crime fighters and their very ordinary – and in the case of Dom, middle-class – existence. While shows such as Top Boy have made urban decay a sexy export, Ikumelo saw a gap in the market for something that operates with a lighter touch, and which diversifies the kinds of Black characters we see on screen. “In terms of what it is to be a Londoner, particularly a Black Londoner, I think it’s important to challenge that,” she says. “Dom is like, I live in De Beauvoir! I don’t know anything about gangs.” Not that the show forgets the hypocrisy of how racedoesaffect who gets in trouble with the law. In season one, Ikumelo recalls: “We realise that there is a deeper world – the gang is serving a bigger, more upper-middle-class auteur.” By contrast, season two sees Kay ushered towards a knife amnesty box as he returns his uniform to the police station.The thrust of the series is a plot to bring down Notting Hill carnival, as orchestrated by a charming spy named Steve (Outlander’s Ed Speleers) who, says Ikumelo, is “so charismatic and suave, you want to hang on his every word”. Cathy Tyson – enjoying a welcome renaissance of late in dramas such as Blue Lights and Boiling Point – joins the cast, too, in a bit of dream casting for Ikumelo. The emotional core of the show, though, remains Dom and Kay (“they’ve evolved into actual friends, there’s a partnership. And that gets tested in some ways,” says Ikumelo, trying to avoid capital-S spoilers). Even as her star continues to rise, it is clear she has a soft spot for making excellent, homegrown comedy. “I love the real workhorse culture they have [in the US],” she says. “But I always miss the rain and the grey, and the cold, damp air. With this show, I’m on home turf … I feel like I’m at my house.”The new series of Black Ops starts on BBC One on 8 January.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2026 culture previewTV comedyComedyGbemisola IkumelointerviewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Ruven AfanadorBoth stars have bigger films on release but are hugely proud of The History of Sound, which has been four years in the making. They talk about the vulnerability of singing, the cost of inhabiting a role – and rationing future partsByRyan GilbeyFri 2 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 10.29 ESTShareAll things considered, tellingPaul MescalI once placed a bet on him is not quite the icebreaker I had hoped. Or rather, it breaks the ice in an unusual way.“The key question,” he says, his voice betraying a hint of trepidation, “is what was the bet? Most Likely to Join the 27 Club?”Wow: that’s bleak – but funny. Josh O’Connor, who plays Mescal’s lover in the austere new wartime love story The History of Sound, certainly thinks so. Cosied up beside his co-star, he is overcome with appalled laughter.It’s true that Mescal was approaching 27 when I had that flutter on him three years ago. But far from betting that he would meet a premature end at the same tender age as Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain, I was throwing down my £25 in a flurry of excitement at his surprise Oscar nomination in 2023 for Charlotte Wells’sAftersun. He played a young father concealing his suicidal depression from his daughter while they are holidaying together in Turkey. His performance, like the film, is infinitely subtle and mysterious, its thrashing turmoil hidden beneath an opaque surface.“Sorry about the £25,” says Mescal, who lost to Brendan Fraser in The Whale. “But thanks for the vote of confidence.”It is an autumnal Saturday afternoon, and we are in a London hotel room. When I entered a few minutes earlier, the PR assistant steered me toward a seat at the other side of the room, far from the two actors. O’Connor, to his credit, having spotted that I had my hands full, sprang to his feet and helpfully dragged my chair closer to him and Mescal. Not for the last time, he gave the impression of being an extremely good boy.Mescal is equally affable but more puckish. There’s a flicker of danger about him: a carnivorous sexuality in contrast to the more wholesome O’Connor. Today, Mescal is wearing a tatty white T-shirt, the sleeves of which he keeps pushing up until you want to say: Yes, yes, great guns, very impressive, now put them away.View image in fullscreenO’Connor and  Mescal in The History of Sound.Photograph: Gwen Capistran/© Fair Winter LLC. All Rights ReservedA vaguely bad boy and maybe a goody-two-shoes, then. But they could scarcely seem more devoted to each other. Their tactility and body language is enough to make anyone nearby feel like a gooseberry. At any given moment during our conversation, one of them is usually angled toward the other, head cocked attentively; the only way they could get any closer is if one jumped into the other’s lap. O’Connor will occasionally snake an arm around the back of Mescal’s chair while his friend is speaking, or Mescal will give O’Connor’s arm or knee a reassuring squeeze. The message is clear: we are straight men who have played several gay roles, yet we are relaxed enough in ourselves not to recoil from intimacy.Right now, Mescal is reflecting on Aftersun while O’Connor, six years his senior and wearing a checked sweatshirt, listens closely. “The Oscars brought the opportunity to celebrate that film in a way that Charlotte and myself had never anticipated,” he says of what was, after all, only his second lead role since the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney’sNormal People, which made him a star. “You don’t make something like Aftersun and think: ‘I know wherewe’llbe going in 2023!’ I doubt that will ever be topped for me, because it’s not the sort of film that usually gets recognised in that capacity.”He’s right: Aftersun is almost an anti-Oscars movie. Even his one crying scene is played in semi-darkness with his back to the camera.“That film is quietly perfect,” sighs O’Connor, who has been friends with Mescal since video-calling him in 2020 to congratulate him on Normal People. “There’s no crescendo. We’re all so used to awards bait.”“The ‘reel’, they call it,” says Mescal, referring to the melodramatic film clips shown at awards ceremonies. “The Oscars reel. Jesus.” He sounds mildly disgusted.View image in fullscreenMescal in Aftersun.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyWe are meeting near the end of 2025 but it is already clear that there is unlikely to be an Oscars reel forThe History of Sound, despite their sensitive performances. Mescal plays Lionel, a singer raised on a farm in the American South, who falls for David (O’Connor), a playful and gifted musicologist. Separated when David goes off to fight in the first world war, they reunite for an expedition through rural Maine harvesting folk songs and recording them on wax cylinders.Among their current crop of films, The History of Sound is eclipsed in Mescal’s case byHamnet, in which he plays Shakespeare, and for O’Connor by the comic whodunitWake Up, Dead Man: A Knives Out Mysteryand the languid heist dramaThe Mastermind. Still, you can’t win ’em all, and The History of Sound is a film of which they are immensely proud. It is also one to which they both remained attached for four years while funding was being sought. “There were times when we thought it might not happen,” admits O’Connor. “But neither of us ever thought about dropping out.”Mescal came to the set straight from playing the hero in theGladiator sequel. “I was 90 kilos and I had eight weeks to get down to 78 kilos,” he grimaces. “It was a real headfuck. I loved the process of making that film but The History of Sound felt like home to me. It’s where I’m most comfortable. I want to make more films like that versus ones on the scale of Gladiator II.”The love story between Lionel and David would always have been intimate, but the presence of song (though this is no musical) adds an extra dimension. “One of the things I love about this film is that it tells a story of intimacy in a new way,” says O’Connor. “Irrespective of my own insecurities about my voice, singing is such a vulnerable act.”Mescal agrees. “I think the thrill comes from the vulnerability,” he says. “It’s like in Irish pubs, it’ll be bustling and then you’ll hear: ‘Shh-shhh.’ And that silence before someone opens their mouth to sing is deafening. You’re afraid to breathe.” Has he ever serenaded anyone? “I’ve sung songs to people. But I feel like ‘serenaded’ has a saccharine sound to it.”Eager to shift the focus away from his personal life, he says: “Josh had two bands!” O’Connor looks sheepish: “They were called Orange Output and Klang. I didn’t sing so much as shout in time.” Orange Output has gained minor notoriety as the band he formed to try to impress Tahliah Barnett, better known now as FKA twigs, after they appeared together in a production of Bugsy Malone at their private school in Cheltenham. When the story broke in 2023, she declared herself “very flattered”.The more musically confident of the pair, Mescal isabout to play Paul McCartney in Sam Mendes’s quartet of Beatles movies, due out in 2028. Those films will be golden oldies in petrol station bargain bins, however, by the time another of his current projects reaches the screen: Mescal is already several years into makingMerrily We Roll Along, an adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical that follows three friends backwards from their disillusioned 40s to their idealistic 20s. Rather than using ageing makeup, the director Richard Linklater (who took 12 years to shoot Boyhood in a similar fashion) is stretching the production over two decades. Pencil it in the diary for 2040.View image in fullscreenO’Connor in The Mastermind.Photograph: MUBI/PAOf the two of them, only Mescal has had songs written about him: word is that he is the subject of bothSidelines, by his ex-girlfriend Phoebe Bridgers, andNormal Thing, by his current partner Gracie Abrams. No such luck for O’Connor. “But Paul’s writing a song for me.” Really? “Well, I hope he is.” At that, Mescal starts warbling: “Josh O’Connorrr, the bestboyyy!” Hmm. There is a lot of emoting going on but no discernible tune. “God, it’s so catchy,” O’Connor fibs.He has said that he wanted to make The History of Sound partly so he could see up close how Mescal does what he does. So — what did he discover? “Well, it’s actually really easy,” he jokes. “No. Um. Well. There is something spiritual about what happens. When ‘action’ is called, and you look into your friend’s eyes and see something depart, and something else take its place, that is a very moving experience. Physically, the form is Paul. But emotionally, spiritually, he’s vacated. How he does that, fuck knows.”Mescal has his own compliment at the ready. “There’s such a generosity of spirit in Josh as a person. He extends that into a performance, sometimes to the detriment of his own well-being. That is an incredibly fucking generous thing to give people for a cinema-going experience. I wouldn’t say he is a method actor but that doesn’t mean he won’t experience the cost to the character because he has such empathy for them.”Does that ring true? “Yeah,” says O’Connor. “Our friend Jessie Buckley calls actors ‘soul collectors’. We learn something from the characters we play, and they never truly leave us. You can see that Aftersun has left an imprint on my friend here.” The same goes for O’Connor after playing Arthur, the white-suited, crypt-robbing treasure-hunter in Alice Rohrwacher’sLa Chimera. “There is a part of Arthur that I inhabit and that still inhabits me. And there is a cost to you by doing that. But Paul is right: there is something generous about being an actor. You put yourself into someone else’s mind, and that’s an empathetic act.”Then Mescal drops a bombshell disguised as an aside. “I’m five or six years into this now, and I feel very lucky. But I’m also learning that I don’t think I can go on doing it as much.” Is he talking about rationing himself? “I think so. I’m gonna have to start doing that. For sure.” A caveat follows: “Rationing doesn’t necessarily mean less.” Huh? “It means learning that films like The History of Sound take more out of the well. You can’t keep going back and expect to consistently deliver something you’re proud of. What that rationing looks like, I don’t know. I miss being on stage, so I might have a time when I’m only doing theatre for a couple of years. I also have different priorities in my personal life that I want to attend to.”View image in fullscreenMescal and O’Connor in The History of Sound.Photograph: Neon and Focus FeaturesThere must be mental health issues to consider, too. I can’t help thinking of the troubled David in The History of Sound, who speaks of the “false chord” he feels chiming inside him. Or Calum, the young father cornered and crumbling in Aftersun. They belong to a pattern of men unable to express or resolve what is plaguing them, whereas the actors themselves seem strikingly un-plagued. What’s their secret?“I don’t know the answer,” says O’Connor. “Being in your life, with your family, having privacy. You have to be in your life. The attention both of us give to taking care of these characters — well, if we went to half that trouble for ourselves in our own lives …” Mescal completes the thought: “We’d be therapists.”O’Connor likes the rationing idea. “I’m going to take some time off, too,” he decides. How to balance that with the imperative to stay visible and current? Step off the train and it will keep speeding along without you. “That’s the great fear,” says Mescal. “But what’s the alternative? I don’t want to resent the thing I love. This sounds bold, but I’d rather not be on the train if that is the choice.”“The nightmare is resenting the work,” O’Connor says. “Also, the more we see of an actor, the harder it is for that actor to pull the wool over your eyes and convince you they’re someone else.”Mescal is staring down the barrel of a months-long awards season campaign for Hamnet. “Once I’ve finished promoting that, I hope nobody gets to see me until 2028 when I’m doing the Beatles. People will get a break from me and I’ll get a break from them.”He could always keep a low profile until Merrily We Roll Along opens in 15 years or so.“Can you imagine?” he says, his eyes lighting up.O’Connor pictures the scene circa the early 2040s: “People will be, like: ‘Why did they cast that absolute nobody in this movie? Remember when he talked about rationing — and then no one ever saw him again?’”The History of Sound is in cinemas from 23 January.Explore more on these topicsPaul MescalJosh O'ConnorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe it’s the “f” sound on “five.” But 2026 is one step beyond, and it’s where we are now, with every science-fiction-style development – principally the widespread adoption of AI – looking dystopian, or maybe worse. (Doesn’t it feel like in a proper dystopia, the brain-numbing corporate-backed anti-human technology would actually work a bit better?) Didn’t anyone warn us about this?The answer, at least with regards to oursci-fi moviesyears ago (or occasionally months ago) positioned in 2026, is yes and no. Some of those warnings are broadly applicable (global catastrophe) but specifically far-fetched (when mankind is inevitably decimated, we will almost certainly take the ape population with us). Some of them are visionary; others just look like bad green screen. But it’s worth examining where various film-makers, from geniuses to grunts, thought we would be situated by this time in our planet’s evolution. So let’s take a look at some of the movies that have been set in 2026 over the years and see if they have anything to teach us.DoomView image in fullscreenPhotograph: REUTERSWell, this doesn’t bode well. According to the video game adaptation Doom, whose 20th anniversary was recently celebrated by no one, 2026 is the year that humanity discovers a portal to an ancient city on Mars, where the people of Earth are able to establish a research facility. Now, the bad stuff – in terms of plot and in terms of garish cinematic imitations of a first-person-shooter video game – doesn’t really go down for another 20 years in the future, so even if we do discover a portal to Mars this year, we might have some time to avoid true disaster. If we did discover a portal to an ancient Martian city, it’s genuinely difficult to tell whetherElon Muskwould still be super-psyched to send everyone to Mars or would instantly become dejected that the portal wasn’t something he personally paid for, allowing him to claim messianic ownership for mankind’s expansion into the stars. That’s before we even get to the harvesting of Martian chromosomes and subsequent mutations into horrific creatures. (Again, this is closer to 2046, not to be confused with the Wong Kar-Wai film.) In general, Doom is – if nothing else – a good test case for why, exactly, we let Mars become a stretch-goal hope for humanity. Whether in John Carpenter’s chintzy space-westernGhosts of Mars, the more grounded sci-fi ofRed Planet, or the woo-woo mysticism of Mission to Mars, our distant neighbor planet doesn’t tend to serve as a beacon of hope. If anyone wants to make that dubious red-planet real estate sale, maybe they should start with at least making the fantasy version look good.The Marvel DregsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jessica Miglio/Courtesy of Marvel StudiosOne of the goofiest quirks of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe is how to account for the various world-threatening cataclysms, including a five-year time jump whose events are largely undepicted in the films themselves, the movies have become like a clock radio perpetually running a few minutes fast – only instead of minutes, it’s years. So there’s a whole bunch of Marvel stuff that various wikis helpfully explain to be taking place in 2026. The good ones, such asGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 3and the underrated rompThe Marvels, take place far away from Earth, so they feel pretty unmoored from our sense of time. But the bad stuff is some of the worst Marvel has ever produced: the nonsensically meandering TV showSecret Invasionand the Zoom-call farce ofAnt Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Judging by this stuff, we’re in for a whole lot of frustrating wheel-spinning in 2026, including the accompanying spin that actually, this nonsensical crap unfolding in front of us is essential to whatever happens next. Even worse, in the real world that assertion will probably prove correct.Dawn of the Planet of the ApesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APHanging around: how Planet of the Apes became Hollywood’s most resilient franchiseRead moreMost of the original five-moviePlanet of the Apescycle is set in the further-flung future of Earth, but the new trilogy that began with 2011’sRise of the Planet of the Apesstarts closer to home, starting its timeline around 2016. So by the time a virus that knocks out most of Earth’s human population has done its damage, and also boosted the intelligence of apes, it’s only 2026, with further human indignities (and simian triumphs) to come. The end-credits sequence of Rise, illustrating how rapidly this virus spreads around the world and set around 2019, looks downright eerie in the wake of the real-world pandemic that would dawn in 2020. By comparison, the movieDawnlooks more abstract; if you can believe it, we’re already six years out from the spread of Covid-19, and humanity, though obviously wounded by the still-spreading virus, hasn’t been annihilated, and our technology certainly hasn’t been knocked out. But this bleakest of the four contemporary Apes movies (at least so far!) still has a substantial bummer in store, suggesting that human and/or ape nature, whatever qualifies as either, will inevitably lead to violent conflict, no matter the work of the best-intentioned among us. We’re at the mercy of those who appeal to others’ worst instincts, even if those instincts don’t represent the majority. Right now, it feels hard to argue with that, even though we probably should.MetropolisView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockThe 50 best movies of 2025 in the USRead moreBy far the most prominent depiction of 2026 in cinema is from a movie close to celebrating its centennial. Fritz Lang’s silent classicMetropolistakes place in a futuristic city where rich businessmen lord over the skyscrapers as workers toil underground on the machines that keep everything running. Rich surface resident Freder, scion of the city’s ruler, has his eyes opened to these massive social gaps when he becomes obsessed with Maria, an underground organizer who preaches a coming together of the two halves of the Metropolis. A scientist with more radical plans creates a robot in her likeness, hoping to bring the whole of Metropolis down in flames. Here, a robot designed to imitate a human isn’t a tool of the ruling corporate class, but someone who wants to see them destroyed; it’s one element inverted by reality in a future that otherwise seems to be well on its way. Metropolis also imagines a world where technology depends on old-fashioned manual labor, which seems like a most logical union of rightwing disdain for “unskilled workers” and corporate enthusiasm for an AI bubble. It hasn’t yet come to pass, but it’s easy to picture some somewhat less stylish-looking version of Lang’s city expanding out with the promise of a return to manufacturing. The trickier, harder-to-imagine feat is the ending of the film, where the gap between the haves and the have-nots is bridged with love; not so much with specific policies. Like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the movie pleads for coexistence; unlike Dawn, it seems optimistic about the possibility that such coexistence could be possible. Given how the billionaire class (or even the less rarified millionaire class) reacts to any suggestion that they should step closer to the needs of the less fortunate, the idea that facing any degree of extremism might chasten them seems fantastical now – more so than it did a century ago. The robot, the caves of toil, the shimmering skyscrapers ... that all seems plausible enough. For rebalancing economic gaps to seem likely, we might have to wait another year. Or hundred.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsMarvelMetropolisDawn of the Planet of the ApesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Here’s your complete guide to 2026’s unmissable televisionByStuart Heritage,Kate AbbottandPhil HarrisonFri 2 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 13.34 ESTShareWaiting for the OutAs the writer of conspiracy thriller Utopia and Covid-era relationship drama Together, Dennis Kelly has form for creating darkly perceptive TV drama. This excellent series stars Josh Finan (whose performance in The Responder earned him a Bafta nomination) as Dan, a philosophy teacher with a troubled family past, working in a prison. As he explores issues around freedom, luck and destiny with the inmates, he starts to wonder if he actually belongs behind bars like his abusive father. Soon, his anxieties threaten to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.BBC One, 3 JanuaryCan You Keep a Secret?View image in fullscreenStaying alive … Dawn French and Mark Heap in Can You Keep a Secret?Photograph: BBC/Big Talk Studios/Alistair HeapDawn French has made a new sitcom, which in itself should be cause for celebration. However, Can You Keep a Secret? is written by Simon Mayhew-Archer (producer of This Country and Funboys) and revolves around a couple trying to cope with the windfall they receive when one of them is mistakenly pronounced dead, which is even better. And Mark Heap is in it too. This one could be brilliant.BBC One, 7 JanuaryBlack OpsView image in fullscreenUndercover … Gbemisola Ikumelo and Hammed Animashaun in Black Ops.Photograph: BBC/Ricky DarkoThefirst seasonof this comedy mined belly laughs from institutional racism, starring Gbemisola Ikumelo and Hammed Animashaun as a pair of Black community support officers talked into infiltrating a drug gang. Season two takes things up a notch: Dom and Kay are now working for MI5. It’s not as glamorous as it sounds though – although their admin jobs soon liven up when they’re approached by charismatic spy Steve. What follows finds a perfect balance between espionage and hilarity.BBC One, 8 JanuaryHeated RivalryView image in fullscreenBringing sexy back … Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie in Heated Rivalry.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/HBOIs ice hockey the sexiest sport on Earth?This showmakes a strong case. Within minutes of meeting, ice-rink nemeses Ilya Rozanov and Shane Hollander are getting it on. And with its near-constant and incredibly raunchy sex scenes, Heated Rivalry is so horny it’s already got certain circles up in arms in the US. Perhaps this is what we all deserve, though: some TV that puts the puck in pucker up.Sky/Now, 10 JanuaryIndustryIt’s all change in this brilliantlybrutal thrillerset in the world of high finance. The departure of Harry Lawtey’s Robert seems to have triggered a reset, so there will be a flurry of new characters led by Whitney Halberstram (Max Minghella), the founder of a flashy payment processing company. Advance reports describe him as “a tornado of cut-throat ambition” so he should fit in just fine. Fans of continuity will be relieved to hear that Harper and Yasmin are still around and creating chaos wherever they go.BBC One, 11 JanuaryA Knight of the Seven KingdomsView image in fullscreenPeter Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBO“It’s a hedge knight. It’s like a knight but … sadder.” ThisGame of Thronesprequel leans into the undercurrent of sly humour that always existed within the original. The hedge knight in question is Ser Duncan the Tall (former Irish rugby union player and first-time actor Peter Claffey), an intrepid but hapless adventurer whose eagerness to earn his spurs isn’t always matched by his ability. Look out for plenty of embryonic origin stories, as ancient members of the Houses Targaryen and Baratheon start to establish bloody rivalries.Sky Atlantic/Now, 18 JanuaryHow to Get to Heaven from BelfastView image in fullscreenVoyage of discovery … Sinead Keenan, Caoilfhionn Dunne and Roisin Gallagher in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/NetflixHow do you follow a generational classic? Lisa McGee is sticking to home territory for this eight-part comedy drama. LikeDerry Girls, it focuses on a tight-knit group of friends: Saoirse, Robyn and Dara embark on a funny, scary adventure prompted by news of the death of a schoolmate. The brilliance of Derry Girls lay in its ability to find constant comedy and humanity in darkness and danger. This voyage of discovery looks set to repeat the trick.Netflix, FebruaryEuphoriaView image in fullscreenUnforgettable … Zendaya as Rue in Euphoria.Photograph: HBOSet five years down the line, Rue (Zendaya) is now in Mexico and seriously indebted to drug honcho Laurie, Jules (Hunter Schafer) is in art school and Nate and Cassie (Jacob Elordi and Sydney Sweeney) are miserable but about to get married. Sam Levinson’sscandalous high-school epichas been remarkable as both a hit-maker – basically everyone is an A-lister! – and a headline generator. This time, music’s golden girl Rosalía joins the cast. Let’s hope it’s just as unforgettable away from the melee of hormones and horror that is the high-school environment, eh.HBO Max, AprilMalcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair!After his world-conquering stint on Breaking Bad,Bryan Cranstoncould pick any project he liked. And that project was a revival of Malcolm in the Middle, the 00s teen sitcom in which he played an ostentatiously panicky dad. Given that Cranston’s performance in the original was truly exceptional, these four new episodes should be worth the wait.Disney+, 10 AprilMargo’s Got Money TroublesView image in fullscreenA total scream … Elle Fanning in Margo’s Got Money Troubles.Photograph: Allyson Riggs/Courtesy of AppleDavid E Kelley, the long-reigning king of TV’s most covetable trash fromAlly McBealtoThe Undoing, adapts this novel about a hard-up woman who finds her fortune on OnlyFans. Elle Fanning stars as Margo, Nick Offerman plays her ex-wrestler dad Jinx Millet and Michelle Pfeiffer (Kelley’s real-life wife) plays her mum, Shyanne. It’s sure to be a total scream.Apple TV, 15 AprilAmandalandIt is now fair to call Amanda Hughes the Frasier Crane of Motherland. In that show, she was a one-dimensional villain – selfish, aloof, oblivious – but last year’sAmandalanddeepened her into something far more complicated. If the new series is able to continue this pattern, Lucy Punch’s character will become the tragicomic heroine of an entire generation.BBCArmy of ShadowsRonan Bennett follows his hits such as Top Boy and The Day of the Jackal by updating this second world war classic – and placing it in a near-future Britain that has been invaded by America. We follow the burgeoning British resistance fighters who are trying to keep their country intact … and get their freedom back. Explosive stuff.Channel 4A Woman of SubstanceThe ultimate rags-to-riches romp! Brenda Blethyn and Jessica Reynolds star as older and younger versions of Emma Harte, who goes from housemaid to business mogul … then one of the richest woman in the world in the 1980s. The last time Channel 4 showed this drama, based on Barbara Taylor Bradford’s book, 13.8 million people tuned in, instantly making it the broadcaster’s biggest drama ever. They’ve still never hit those giddy heights again. Can they double down?Channel 4BaitBait was created and written by its star,Riz Ahmed. The story of a struggling actor on the verge of a big career breakthrough, it is “easily the most personal thing I’ve ever done”, he has said. However, it is also about what happens when a trippy conspiracy theory throws you into an existential crisis, which might be why he also said: “Maybe I should have just done therapy.”Prime VideoBabiesView image in fullscreenTender and melancholy … Babies.Photograph: BBC/Snowed-In/Amanda SearleWe’re huge fans of Stefan Golaszewski’s tender, funny yet always tinged with melancholy work such as Him & Her and Mum (which still makes us weep just to think of it). His latest show, Babies, sounds like no exception – with Paapa Essiedu and Siobhán Cullen starring as a couple who have to deal with the unparalleled grief of multiple pregnancy losses.BBCBeefThebest show of 2023is back with a new series. The last, in which Steven Yeun and Ali Wong fell into a rapidly escalating disagreement, was an absolute masterpiece. This time round there’s a whole new cast, including Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan, and a brand new disagreement. Can it be as good as the first? Can anything?NetflixBlue Planet IIIView image in fullscreenUtterly mind-boggling … a nurse shark glides through a shoal of sardines in Blue Planet III.Photograph: Anoushka Freedman/BBC StudiosDavid Attenborough celebrates his 100th birthday in May 2026 and he’ll be marking it with another landmark natural history epic. In a strong field, the first twoseasonsof Blue Planet are among his most memorable works: not only do the depths of the ocean offer utterly mind-boggling sights but it’s in the sea that humanity’s impact on nature can be most easily seen. Increasingly, Attenborough has refused to ignore environmental issues so this is likely to be a bracing watch as well as a beautiful one.BBC OneBuffy the Vampire Slayer: New SunnydaleBuffy the Vampire Slayer has had aJoss Whedon problemfor a while now. People still love it, but they have a hard time reconciling it with the actions that got its creator cancelled. The solution? New Sunnydale, a brand new Buffy set 25 years after the original. Sarah Michelle Gellar is back, heading up a new cast. Chloé Zhao (of Hamnet fame) has directed the pilot.Disney+California AvenueEver since 2011’s The Shadow Line, Hugo Blick has delighted in appearing every few years with a new, ambitious, boundary-testing standalone miniseries. California Avenue sounds like no exception. It’s about a woman on the run who takes refuge in a caravan park with her 11-year-old child. Erin Doherty, Bill Nighy, Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Burke star.BBCDear EnglandView image in fullscreenStirring stuff … Joseph Fiennes as Gareth Southgate in Dear England.Photograph: BBC/Left BankIt began as a letter, then became a play. Now Gareth Southgate’s 2021 state of the nation address has become a TV show. As with the stage version,Joseph Fienneswill play Southgate, leading a cast that includes Jodie Whittaker and Jason Watkins. If it’s faithful to the play – and it should be, since James Graham has written both versions – this will be stirring stuff indeed.BBCDTF St Louis“I would like you to go about your business and do tasks on your phone, while you sit on my face.” Landing with big NSFW energy – the acronym means “Down to Fuck” – on the new HBO Max channel (launching in the UK in March), it stars Jason Bateman, Linda Cardellini and David Harbour in a tale of bored suburbanites who end up on a hook-up app … until one of them winds up dead.HBO MaxFallingView image in fullscreenThere will be fireworks … Keeley Hawes as Anna and Paapa Essiedu as David in Falling.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Channel 4Keeley Hawes and Paapa Essiedu play a nun and a Catholic priest who encounter all sorts of emotional turmoil when they fall in love. Written by man of the momentJack Thorne, this is, shockingly, the first love story he has ever penned. There will be fireworks.Channel 4First Day on EarthView image in fullscreenAstonishing … Michaela Coel in First Day on Earth.Photograph: BBCSix years after the astonishingI May Destroy Youpretty much invented a new TV language, Michaela Coel returns with another authored show. Coel is writer, star and executive producer of this drama about a blocked novelist, Henri, who is offered a job on a film in Ghana (the home of her estranged father) and can’t resist a roll of the dice. However, nothing about west Africa – or her father – is as she thought.BBC OneHalf ManView image in fullscreenGuaranteed to get a flood of public interest … Half Man.Photograph: Anne Binckebanck/BBC/Mam Tor ProductionsAs the follow-up toBaby Reindeer, Richard Gadd’s Half Man will surely be hit with a flood of public interest upon release. As yet, nobody knows what the show is – it’s described as being about brothers – but it will star Gadd alongside Jamie Bell, and hopefully won’t result in the inspiration for any of the characters appearing on Piers Morgan.BBC OneLast One Laughing UKAlthough the first season of Last One Laughing – a sort of condensed Big Brother about comedians trying to make other comedians laugh – came with no expectations, the second is already one of the most anticipated of the year. We are very hopeful about the lineup – which this time features everyone from Ultimate Traitor Alan Carr to Diane “Philomena Cunk” Morgan, Mel Giedroyc and David Mitchell. But the best news of all? Defending champion, the sublimeBob Mortimer, will be back too!Prime VideoLine of DutyView image in fullscreenNow we’re sucking diesel … Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar in Line of Duty.Photograph: BBC/World Productions/Steffan Hill/PANow we’re sucking diesel! After a year of rumours, the seventh season of this much-loved police procedural was confirmed in November. But AC-12 is dead, so long live the Inspectorate of Police Standards, which is the catchy moniker under which officers Hastings, Fleming and Arnott will now be working. In a plotline that looks unlikely to stretch plausibility to breaking point, the team will be investigating a detective inspector accused of being a sexual predator.BBC OneMaudHer last show All’s Fair may have brought about a flurry ofzero-star reviews, butGlenn Close’s Maud sounds much better. Close plays “an old killer with a tortured past” who becomes tired of looking after everyone and sets out to begin a second act. Close is never better than when she has a role she can fully sink her teeth into. This sounds like exactly that.Channel 4MayaView image in fullscreenOn the run … Daisy Haggard in Maya.Photograph: Channel 4Her seriesBack to Lifewas often just as sad as it was funny, so it’s no surprise that Daisy Haggard’s next show is a full-blown thriller. Maya is about a woman (Haggard) and her daughter (Bella Ramsey) who flee their lives and begin again in a witness protection programme in rural Scotland, while a pair of hitmen search for them. Everything about this one looks wonderful.Channel 4MintWithin minutes of this drama opening, Shannon (played by Emma Laird) talks about her longing for romance and wanting her life to be magic … before literally soaring off the ground. With its magical realism and the use of camcorder footage, we can certainly expect surreal, experimental things from the first show by Charlotte Regan (who directed the movie Scrapper.) Soon enough, a love interest comes along in the form of Arran – played by Ben Coyle-Larner (AKA musician Loyle Carner.)BBCNumber 10Steven Moffat had us at “Press Gang in Downing Street”, but really Number 10 sounds more like a British West Wing than anything else. Moffat’s series about the inner workings of 10 Downing Street, concerning the individuals who keep such a bizarre residence going, has all the markings of a blockbuster.Channel 4Pride and PrejudiceView image in fullscreenUniversal truth … Pride and Prejudice.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/NetflixAs if the return of Netflix mainstay Bridgerton and the BBC’sThe Other Bennet Sisterweren’t enough to make period drama fans swoon into their smelling salts, here comes Dolly Alderton’s Pride and Prejudice. Will it become as beloved as the Colin Firth version? Let’s wait till Jack Lowden emerges from that lake, shirt sodden and billowing, to find out.NetflixRivalsView image in fullscreenRomp alert … Nafessa Williams in Rivals.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/Disney+Finally, after far too long, the second series of Disney’s febrile Jilly Cooperadaptation– almost certainly the horniest show ever to revolve round regional TV franchises – will arrive in 2026. Expect bums, boobs, romps, backstabbers, cads, bounders, revenge, perms, poshness, bravado, bitchiness, ego, excess and deception. And bums.Disney+Small ProphetsThis comedy was written by Mackenzie Crook and, like his previous creation, the utterly sublime Detectorists, it looks for magic in the mundane. The series centres on Pearce Quigley’s gently eccentric Michael Sleep – a man who works in a DIY store, hangs out with his dad Brian (Michael Palin) and pines after his beloved partner Clea who disappeared seven years earlier. Then Michael tries to create a homunculus and things start to get weird. Sophie Willan, Jon Pointing and Lauren Patel also star.BBCSpider-NoirNicolas Cage all but stole 2018’s Into the Spider-Verse as Spider-Man Noir, a monochrome 1930s private investigator who also has the powers of Spider-Man. Amazingly, that character is about to get its own series. Even more amazingly, Cage is reprising his role. Even more amazingly, it’s going to be live action. This could be, well, amazing.Disney+The AltruistsIn the mould of The Dropout or Dopesick, The Altruists is a ripped-from-the-headlines drama about Sam Bankman-Fried, the real-life disgraced founder of a collapsed crypto exchange. Bankman-Fried’s fall from grace was certainly spectacular enough to warrant the treatment, so here’s hoping showrunner Graham Moore does it justice. Julia Garner and Anthony Boyle star.NetflixThe BoroughsAfter ending the year with the biggest bang imaginable in the Stranger Things finale, the Duffer Brothers already have their next project in the bag. The Boroughs stars Geena Davis andAlfred Molinaand is described as a sci-fi set in a retirement village, where “a group of unlikely heroes must band together to stop an otherworldly threat from stealing the one thing they don’t have … time”.NetflixThe Boys from BrazilAfter spending the last decade on The Crown, Peter Morgan dives into a story of Nazi hunters in an epic miniseries adapted from Ira Levin’s 70s novel. The ever-intense Jeremy Strong stars as Yakov Liebermann (played by Laurence Olivier in the 1978 film), a Holocaust survivor who has devoted his life to tracking down Nazis on the run – then gets a phone call from Brazil with intel on a fugitive German eugenicist.NetflixThe CageWhen The Responder – starring Martin Freeman as a scouse night cop on the brink of a breakdown – first appeared, it came out of the gates so fully formed and so spectacular that it was inconceivable that this was Tony Schumacher’s first show. And yet it was true. Now comes his second, The Cage, starring the brilliant Sheridan Smith and Michael Socha – about two Liverpool casino workers who discover they’re both robbing from the same safe …. and the same gangster. You wouldn’t want to bet against this one.BBCThe Devil in the White CityThis Martin Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio collaboration – about the serial killer who offed people in his Murder Castle in Chicago in the run-up to the 1893 World’s Fair – has been mooted for way over a decade, starting life as a movie. Will this be the year we finally see it … and as a full series no less?TBAThe Miniature WifeLike Succession meets, er, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, The Miniature Wife sounds like an incredibly timely satire, tackling both romantic power plays and our extreme technological angst. Matthew Macfadyen’s Les has to deal with the fallout after he shrinks his wife Lindy (Elizabeth Banks) to six inches high.

Fortunately that will change soon, just in time for its second season.HBO MaxThe Reluctant VampireRob and Neil Gibbons of Alan Partridge fame have written a sitcom about what Lenny Rush would be like if he had to pretend to be a vampire all the time.

Twenty-five years on from Queer As Folk, Davies and his team are going back to Manchester’s Canal Street to shed light on the LGBTQ+ community today amid rising danger and fear. As he has said: “This is a show I had to write because the world is getting stranger, tougher and darker, and frankly, the fight is on.” Bring it.Channel 4TimeFirstit wasStephen Graham with Sean Bean. Thenit wasBella Ramsey, Tamara Lawrance and Jodie Whittaker. Now for the third instalment of Jimmy McGovern’s harrowing but gripping prison drama, David Tennant will be going head to head with Siobhan Finneran, who returns as the prison pastor (only now she’s lost her faith). It’s set in a young offenders institution when chaos hits, so it’s sure to be a riot of violence and raging hormones.BBC OneTomb RaiderFor an absurdly long time, it looked like the only thing to emerge from Amazon’s $100m deal with Phoebe Waller-Bridge was a little-watched documentary about octopuses. But that changes in 2026, because her big new Tomb Raider adaptation will finally arrive, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Let’s hope it was worth the investment.Prime VideoTrinityJed Mercurio has a busy year ahead. As well as the return of Line of Duty, there is also Netflix’s Trinity – a high-stakes drama about a naval officer who becomes entwined with the secretary of defence. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the officer, Richard Madden is the secretary, and if it’s anything like Bodyguard, this will be all we’ll talk about for weeks.NetflixTwenty Twenty SixView image in fullscreenScathing satire … Hugh Bonneville as Ian Fletcher and Chelsey Crisp as Sarah Campbell in Twenty Twenty Six.Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC/Expectation EntertainmentIt may have its detractors, but John Morton’s Twenty Twelve and W1A were living proof that the BBC is its own biggest critic. Luckily, 2026 will see an update, set round the World Cup. Hughs Bonneville and Skinner return for more scathing satire about what it’s like to be trapped in the bureaucratic nightmare of an organisation unable to work out its own identity.BBC TwoVisionQuestAfter a string of skippable duds, the MCU’s television adventures continue with VisionQuest. Happily, there’s lots to be excited about here. Billed as the final part of a trilogy that began with WandaVision and Agatha All Along, it sounds like it will be an exploration of Marvel’s AI characters, from Vision to Ultron.Disney+WarGeorge Kay is a writer with tremendous pedigree, so his new show War should be highly anticipated purely because of that. However, it also stars Dominic West andSienna Milleras a divorcing high-powered couple (he a tech titan, she a movie star) who resort to underhand methods to get what they deserve.

The cross-generational lineup and captivating ideas of Riversphere, his first solo release in years, testify to exactly why he has stayed there for 40 years.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Riversphere Vol 1In their 20s, Ballamy and pianist/composer Django Bates frequently joined forces as two mavericks, skilfully respectful of the classic jazz tradition while adventurously and often mischievously transforming it. They were key figures in a gifted UK generation that created some of the sparkiest European jazz of the 1980s and 90s, most influentially in the revolutionary orchestra Loose Tubes, which brought together genres from old-school swing to vaudeville, improv and avant-rock, and on occasion really did get people dancing in the streets.Riversphere likens the interweaving of rivers to the flows of music-making between genres, individuals and across the blurred lines of composition and improv. Ballamy’s beautifully paced and tonally evocative sax sound fronts an A-list quartet with the atmospherically Bill Frisell-ian guitarist Rob Luft, bassist Conor Chaplin and drummer Corrie Dick, while the ever-empathic Laura Jurd and Ballamy’s very promising son Charlie share trumpet roles on three tracks – notably the set’s exquisitely harmonised finale, As Time Passes.The horns and guitar shift from folksy songlike lines to raw note-bending on the opening Harmonique, while wistful guitar and sax long tones delicately drift through softly shifting drum patterns on Unresolved. Frisell’s dreamy Strange Meeting sets slow tenor exhalations floating amid treble-guitar peals, and two yearning Chico Buarque/Jobim songs warmly reflect both Ballamy’s affection for Latin jazz and north-Euro ambient music, and Luft’s versatility as a tone-poet and a nimble postbopper. Volume 2 is already in the pipeline – an intriguing prospect for later this year.Also out this monthKeyboardist Craig Taborn, legendary reeds player Henry Threadgill and trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire are among many jazz stars duetting with double bassistThomas Morganon the latter’s Around You Is a Forest (Loveland) – but Morgan mainly plays the Woods here, his own virtual invention mimicking the sounds of lutes, harps, zithers and more. The machine creates a fascinating soundscape, even if, compared to Morgan’s bass imagination, it sometimes seems to hamper the two-way flexibility of these conversations.Tom Ollendorff’s Where in the World (Fresh Sound New Talent) creatively augments this fine young UK guitarist’s closely attuned regular trio with Blue Note’s US piano star Aaron Parks, on fast, hard-boppish groovers, elegant melodies (all Ollendorff’s) and inventive improv. And the late great UK pianistJohn Taylor’s Tramonto (ECM) is the welcome unveiling of a live recording by the superb 2002 trio (with Americans Marc Johnson on bass and Joey Baron on drums) who made Taylor’s iconic ECM studio set Rosslyn in the same year.Explore more on these topicsMusicJazz album of the monthJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

The British four-piece are keen to take us back to their early 00s heyday, a time of Met bar table service, where the ladies have “a little prosecco” and the guys have a “nice cold beer”. Musically, it’s a clunkier approximation of their (comparatively) harder-edged hybrid of pop, hip-hop and R&B; think 2002 “low ride” anthem Fly By II but on a Megabus budget.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for ReflectionsIt makes sense that they would want to tap into modern pop’s deep well of nostalgia, but rather than recalling what made Blue originally stand out, Reflections often feels like a tribute to other evergreen boybands. For most of the album’s 13 tracks, the tempo is mid, with the dreary, Westlife-on-a-bad-day Candlelight Fades a particular nadir. The windsweptOne Last Timeand The Day the Earth Stood Still are attacked with gusto, but both feel like Patience-era Take That, while the pleasingly epic opener The Vow is hindered by very un-Barlow lyrics: “You’re a sweet child of mine / You’re like a grape to my vine.”With multiple references to the band’s history, acoustic closer Find That Feeling pleads for a chance to return to the start, “to be young and to be foolish”. Reflections makes you wish they’d focused on more of the latter.Explore more on these topicsBluePop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

I think it was pre-school. My mother was not always a patient teacher, and I was often a slow learner, but the scene, the tableaux, in memory, has the serenity of an icon.My favourite book growing upRosemary Sutcliff’sThe Eagle of the Ninth. It’s a story set in Roman Britain; the Eagle is the lost standard of the ninth legion. I was a boy already obsessed by all things Ancient Roman (the alternative to the kind of boy obsessed with dinosaurs). One of the places I remember reading it is in bed with my dad. On Sunday mornings my brother and I would climb into the big bed. My parents had long since split up. There was a picture on the wall, a modest reproduction of Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. To me, this voluptuous woman gazing at herself in a mirror was my mother. It’s interesting to me how the setting in which you read is such an integral part of the reading experience.The book that changed me as a teenagerI wasn’t quite a teenager (I was 12) and it’s not quite a book, but it definitely changed me. The end of the summer term at school, there was an outdoor production of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. I was Cobweb, one of Titania’s fairy servants. The play was performed at dusk. All around us, Wiltshire fields and Wiltshire woodland. The atmosphere poured into me: two worlds touching; the overwhelming richness of the language. No doubt the feeling was partly shaped by anticipation of the long holiday. Also, of course, by being a pubescent boy. Theatre is sexy, always.The writer who changed my mindAlbert Camus,The Myth of Sisyphus– his inquiry into why, given the absurdity of life, you might not choose suicide. I was 18, not remotely suicidal, but wanting to be cleverer and a bit French. (These are not despicable ambitions.) And Camus is very cool. These days he would be sponsored by a company making raincoats. His “philosophy” is that of Polish cavalry preparing to charge German tanks. One is to be stylish. One does not make a fuss. One notices everything. One does not imagine that anything can be saved.Amor fati.The book that made me want to be a writerThis is an easy one.The RainbowbyDH Lawrence. We were reading it for A-level. I found the book overwhelming. I felt I was being shown Life. All my own yearning as a 17-year-old (one who was very much in love) was spoken to by this somewhat cantankerous son of a Nottinghamshire miner. The final scenes of the novel forced me on to my feet. I was madly excited. I could think of no better way to spend a life than trying to create something like this myself. It’s worth keeping in mind the shocking fact that in 1915 The Rainbow was censored, and more than 1,000 copies of it were burned. OK to send young men to die like flies in France, but a whisper of sex … No, thank you.The book or author I came back toAs a DH Lawrence fan, I allowed myself to be influenced by the Cambridge critic FR Leavis who (in my understanding) seemed to suggest that if you were for Lawrence you couldn’t be forJoyce. Lawrence was morally serious; Joyce was not. Out of loyalty to Lawrence it took me years to get to Joyce, and it wasn’t until I readDubliners, and specifically The Dead, that I saw what should have been obvious – you don’t have to choose. Hugely different personalities, both precious.Theauthor I rereadRecently I’ve been rereadingEM Forster. I’m not sure what sparked that. I reread them all (with the exception of A Passage to India). I was immensely impressed. He communicates a deep sanity in his novels, and an urgent and still very relevant call to emotional maturity and openness.Where Angels Fear to Tread– early and quite slight – is a big favourite. All his themes are there. Also,A Room With a View. He’s an author whose strong, calm voice – never shrill – we need to hear more of.The book I could never read againCountless. All those thrillers that hung around the house (and that I thoroughly enjoyed as a young teen): Desmond Bagley, Hammond Innes, Alistair MacLean, Ian Fleming. I admire them, their professionalism, their craftsmanship. But to read them again would be like struggling back into my school uniform.Theauthor I discovered later in lifePenelope Fitzgerald. I knew nothing about her until my mid-30s. The first book of hers I read was the last she wrote:The Blue Flower. Thrillingly strange, sometimes very funny, it is, I think, an obvious masterpiece – fragments from the life of an 18th-century German poet who died while still very young. She brought to it a whole long life’s worth of understanding and insight. It’s a portrait of various kinds of madness, but a saner book you won’t find.The book I am currently readingDominion by Tom Holland: a history of Christianity and how it has shaped the culture to the extent that it’s almost invisible (we are the goldfish, says Holland, and Christianity is the water we swim in). I’m very grateful to him. I know more, and am rethinking some of my lazy assumptions. Alongside it, I’m rereadingElizabeth Bishop’scollectedpoems. Nothing flashy about her stuff. Just the calm authority of one who knew, with pen in hand, exactly what she was doing. She used to be somewhat in Robert Lowell’s shadow, but not any more; a poet’s poet (like Marianne Moore, whom she knew well). What seems at first wry and ironic, appears, on rereading, more like heartbreak.My comfort readReally, what I’d like are my old Tintin albums. But where are they? Did I give them away? Hergé is a slightly controversial figure. He didn’t cover himself in glory during the war. I think Tintin and Captain Haddock might not approve of him. But as boys, my brother and I couldn’t get enough of it.The Land in Winter by Andrew Miller is published by Sceptre. To support the Guardian, buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

But when the deception brings no material gain, we might also be curious about what purpose the lie serves – what particular need of their own the liar is attempting to meet. This is precisely what Grace Murray’s witty, assured debut explores: not just the consequences of a lie but the ways in which it can, paradoxically, reveal certain truths.At a small liberal arts college in upstate New York, Charlotte begins her final year by claiming that her father has just died of a heart attack. In fact, he is alive and well back in Lichfield, England. This lie is the jumping-off point for an unpacking of Charlotte’s psychology, as well as the catalyst for her relationship with fellow student Katarina, a quasi-love story that forms the book’s main narrative.Murray’s prose has an energising precision and originality, and the campus setting is a rich source of both comedy and social commentary. There’s some excellent art school satire throughout, as when Charlotte’s academic adviser tells her, by way of encouragement: “We don’t like failing people here.” She responds, laconically, “I know,” before silently reflecting on previous final projects students have turned in, including “de-shelled M&Ms; a bathroom selfie series; a felt-tip drawing of Jeff Buckley”. Murray’s comedy is perfectly judged throughout: it never overplays its hand or outstays its welcome.Murray’s comedy is perfectly judged throughout: it never overplays its hand or outstays its welcomeBut this is not primarily a comic novel, or if it is, it’s a very sad one. Charlotte’s relationship with Katarina has a doomed, precarious quality from the start, undermined not only by Charlotte’s deception but by her emotional detachment, her attempts to become, in her own words, “an emotionless eunuch”. With psychological acuity, Murray creates a distinct sense of the women’s opposing natures, Katarina’s buoyant sweetness contrasting with Charlotte’s coldness.This kind of narrator can be tricky to pull off, creating a vacuum at the heart of a book. Murray seems well aware of this. Charlotte tells us: “My personality could be characterised by a distinct lack – of almost everything. Lying was one of the only things I did for myself, the only time I felt active, a real person, and I was good at it. But it was just another absence, this inability to be honest.”Occasionally, in the first part of the novel, the dissociation of Charlotte’s voice might feel a little overdone (“When I came back, Lars was waiting for me, phone still in hand. I might have been crying – red-rimmed, a raw, bloated face – but it was hard to tell. I might have been fine”). But while some narratives eventually start to buckle under the weight of the voice, the opposite is true here. The cumulative effect is powerful, and there is a subtle shift as the novel goes on, a gradual increase in depth and emotion. Late on, Charlotte notes her own resistance to making fun of her slightly pathetic adviser, blaming Katarina for this alteration: “Before her, nobody had a context. She had opened me up to it, to the idea of the man’s twin bed, his daily teeter over to the sink, fluoxetine prescription in his cabinet.” By the end of the novel, the impact of Charlotte’s narration has changed from deliberately alienating to deeply moving, with scarcely a false note along the way.With characteristic discernment, Murray resists any neat, sentimental resolution to the story. I had one reservation about the final quarter of the book, when a significant revelation lands that is suggested as at least a partial explanation for Charlotte’s lie. For me, the novel would have been stronger without this, or at least without it being presented as a late-stage reveal; the structure meant that this aspect felt a little underexplored. Overall, however, Murray displays keen narrative instincts and a perfect ear for prose.It’s hard to make any reference to a young author’s age without sounding patronising, so I’m reluctant to labour the fact that Murray is just 22. But she deserves credit for, I assume, writing much of this novel before she was old enough to buy a beer in the country where it’s set. Not that she needs it; this is a superb debut for a writer of any age.Blank Canvas by Grace Murray is published by Fig Tree (£14.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

A central sequence entitled Impasse is inspired by Georges Simenon’s Maigret novels. These poems plunge us into the landscape of the detective hero’s world, a process O’Brien describes as “analogous to dream-life, where certain motifs (cities, railway stations, libraries in my case) recur without ever abolishing the mystery that animates them”. The penultimate poem of the final sequence ushers in an elegiac, pensive tone as the speaker reminds us not to forget “birdsong / the descant of the rising lark / that never ends, composed of silence”. The book reinforces O’Brien’s authority as a chronicler of our times, “love and death consorting as they must”.View image in fullscreenPlasticby Matthew Rice (Fitzcarraldo, £12.99)This book-length poem explores the experiences of a night worker turned poet. Structured as a continuous narrative, it illustrates the frustrations, inequities and relentless cycle of 21st-century manual labour: “The night is proletarian, a morgue of ghosts / given the present is a borderline”. Rice documents the tragic incidents and surreal imaginings that occur within the nightmarish confines of a plastic moulding factory. “Once, in this building, a kid clocked off night shift / for good at the end of a rope / another’s heart gave out at 3am / performing a task as menial as mine.” This sardonic, bleakly moving book interrogates ideas of working-class masculinity and intergenerational trauma, with “hell as an idea of what work could be”; there are glimpses of hope in poetry itself, “the treasure buried in my father’s field”.Retablofor a Door by Michelle Penn(Shearsman, £12.95)Penn’s latest collection draws on the concept of a retablo – a votive created in thanks for protection or a miracle – to explore challenging aspects of female experience. In doing so, she conveys multiple images of womanhood as “a gallery of retablos, every edge, every overcoming”. Divided into seven sections, these vivid and formally innovative poems engage with ideas of performance and becoming, depicting vulnerable moments of self-effacement and discomfort in the search for identity. The exploration of intense emotions culminates in the final poem’s searing assertion of defiance as it champions “the humiliated girls, the taunted girls, the bullied girls and the rejected girls”. Penn envisages their uprising and rebellion as they “nap on the sand’s neck, soak in the ocean / defy the world where women trail girls / behind them like flames”.View image in fullscreenJonah and Meby John F Deane (Carcanet, £12.99)Deane’s poetry shimmers with the luminosity of his Christian faith, explored through various voices. He exhorts us to live a life filled with reverence for “Yeshua – you, water-walker”, to whom the poet comes to “offer poems, petitionary, like prayers”. These lucid, musical poems are attuned to the beauty of nature, “waves of grass under the breeze / and gracious meadows wild with buttercups”. Deane acknowledges the fragmented times we live in – “we know that barbarism / divides us, soul from soul” and “the world faces its nightmares / of wars and violence”. This is an expansive, sonically rich collection, filled with captivating images and resonant phrases that leave us with a sense of wonder. The final poem gestures towards a spiritual departure from life as the speaker envisions slipping “through the red gate”, finding “the longed-for strength”, “towards a long-anticipated rest”.Intimate Architectureby Tess Jolly (Blue Diode, £10)The titular poem of Jolly’s second collection evokes the image of a doll’s house where the walls are “as tender as our honeycomb of chambers / protected by paper-thin membranes”. Many of the poems explore the need for “delicate” boundaries in a relationship between the self and the other. Recalling fairytale, myth and childhood memory, these well-crafted works reveal inner anxieties as they collide with external realities, “the structures we built from our fear of the world”. Jolly skilfully depicts the tensions within human relationships as well as the desire for intimacy, where “those who love her / learn to hold their tongues / as she holds them / at arm’s length – longing / to let herself be held”. Her use of imagery is arresting: “the stars like tiny bulbs so bright / they could, at any moment, shatter”; a forest which “imagines a different story”; the fragility of an anorexic female body, “your flamingo legs … the trick of your stick-insect arms”.Explore more on these topicsPoetryPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

Its scandalous story reveals much about the playwright and resonates freshlyMichael BillingtonFri 2 Jan 2026 07.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 08.37 ESTShareIhear on the grapevine that plans to name a London West End theatre after Terence Rattigan have temporarily stalled. An even better way to honour Rattigan is to revive his plays and the latest such revival is the rarely seen Man and Boy, which opens at theNational’s Dorfman theatreat the end of this month. The play had brief runs on Broadway and in London in 1963 withCharles Boyerin the lead and another outing in 2005 with David Suchet giving a mesmerising performance as “the man” of the title, a beleaguered Romanian financier, but to all intents and purposes this is an unknown Rattigan.I would suggest that it reveals a surprising amount about its author. The first thing to hit one is how much the play’s success or failure mattered to Rattigan himself. It was sparked by a book about the swindling Swedish financier Ivar Kreuger, whose business empire collapsed at the height of the Great Depression. Setting the action in 1934, Rattigan shows his hero, Gregor Antonescu, hiding out in his estranged son’s Greenwich Village apartment to which he lures the chair of American Electric in the hope of securing a life-saving merger. What is shocking is the ruthlessness with which Gregor exploits his son’s sexual charms.Equally astonishing is the normally diplomatic Rattigan’s belief that the play should be performed on his own terms or not at all. To him Gregor is “as evil as Iago” and when the play’s intended star, Rex Harrison, and director, Glen Byam Shaw, sought to soften the text and Laurence Olivier rejected the play for his opening Chichester season, Rattigan dug his heels in. The play mattered hugely to Rattigan because, with his theatrical reputation at its lowest ebbb thanks to the rise of a new Royal Court generation, he felt it was his last chance to prove he was a serious dramatist.View image in fullscreenTerence Rattigan … his own father’s scandal deeply affected his life and work.Photograph: Gordon Anthony/Getty ImagesBut there are more personal reasons behind Rattigan’s emotional investment. At heart, the play is a father-and-son drama and you only have to read the excellent biographies byMichael Darlowand Geoffrey Wansell to realise how crucial to Rattigan’s life and work was his own filial relationship. His father, Frank, was a career diplomat forced to resign after an affair with a Romanian princess: in many ways his father’s antithesis, Rattigan inherited his talent for pretence and belief in masked emotion.But he also used his work to explore the complexities of their relationship. He said ofAdventure Story, his play about Alexander the Great, that the hero’s “physical energy, strategic brilliance and determination were inspired by love of his father”. Conversely in Who Is Sylvia? – written a year later, in 1950 – the sexually voracious hero who stays resolutely married is a thinly disguised portrait of philandering Frank. By the time we get to Man and Boy, Rattigan bases the whole work on a tangled father-son relationship full of social and political antagonism and interdependence.Yet another thread running through the play is that of homosexuality and it is fascinating how often Rattigan, the most discreet of men in relation to sexual disclosure, returns to the theme. David Hare once persuaded me that Crocker-Harris, the schoolmaster hero of Rattigan’sThe Browning Version, is a shrewdly manipulative figure who always ends up with his wife’s lovers. Rattigan’s Alexander the Great enjoys an implicitly gay relationship with his confidant, Hephaestion. In Table Number Seven, the second half ofSeparate Tables, the residents of a private hotel rally to the defence of a bogus major accused of sexual importuning. Initially couched in hetero terms, the major’s lapse is clearly a metaphor for cottaging and it is greatly to Rattigan’s credit that in 1954, three years before the Wolfenden report advocated that “homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence”, he saw a shift in public attitudes.But while Man and Boy was clearly of huge importance to Rattigan, does it matter to us? Audiences will judge for themselves, but it is hard not to see in it intimations of more recent scandals. One inevitably thinks of Robert Maxwell, the Czech-born media mogul who misappropriated the Mirror’s pension fund and who died in mysterious circumstances. His daughter, Ghislaine, was the accomplice of the American financier Jeffrey Epstein, convicted of child sexual abuse offences.The sins of Rattigan’s Gregor are less rank but, while he is heartless, exploitative and dishonest, he has a dynamism and drive that make him – not unlike Lambert Le Roux in David Hare and Howard Brenton’s Pravda – theatrically compelling. Rattigan has grasped the central paradox of drama: that we are fascinated by monsters as long as they embody William Blake’s maxim that “energy is eternal delight”.Man and Boy is at theNational Theatre, London, 30 January to 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreTerence RattiganNational TheatreDavid SuchetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In 2013, Duthuit gave the Pompidou Centre Marguerite with a Black Cat, one of Matisse’s best known portraits of his daughter.View image in fullscreenMarguerite, 1901 ou 1906.Photograph: Musée d’Art Moderne de ParisMarguerite, who was Matisse’s favourite subject, was born during his relationship with one of his models, Caroline Joblau, when he was studying art inParis. The artist recognised the child and brought Marguerite to live with his new family, including her half-brothers Jean and Pierre, when he married four years later.Aged six, Marguerite contracted diphtheria and had an emergency tracheotomy. For many years she would disguise the scar with high-necked blouses or ribbons, as the portraits show, until she underwent an operation to repair it when she was 26.Although her health remained fragile, Marguerite joined the French resistance during the second world war, was tortured by the Gestapo, and was threatened with deportation to a Nazi concentration camp.She had taken up painting and was included in group exhibitions during the war, but gave it up to devote herself to being her father’s assistant and agent until his death at 84, in November 1954. She was still cataloguing her father’s work when she died in Paris in 1982, aged 87.Matisse preferred to keep his art in the family rather than sell it, making the donation particularly significant. The 61 pieces will join the 20 Matisse artworks already held by the museum.View image in fullscreenÉtudes pour Marguerite lisant, 1906.Photograph: Jean-Louis Losi/Musée d’Art Moderne de ParisFabrice Hergott, MAM’s director, described the portraits of Marguerite as “extremely beautiful and moving”.“This extraordinarily generous gesture testifies to Madame Duthuit’s deep commitment to and confidence in the museum, which effectively becomes Marguerite’s new home for the decades and centuries to come,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHenri MatisseParisFranceMuseumsEuropePaintingDrawingnewsShareReuse this content"

I liked him as a person but his name tasted like crunchy green pears and I don’t like green pears at all. My compromise was to call him Phil, which tastes more like stewed pear – sweeter and not as crunchy. It’s just a nicer-tasting name in my mind.Fortunately I was 30 by the time I met Phil, so I had an explanation for my word-taste associations, after years of strange looks from family and friends. I had lexical-gustatory synaesthesia, one of the rarest forms of the phenomenon, in which words or sounds trigger taste sensations. Researchers estimate it affects just 0.2% of the population.The way I feel: I see music in colours as I play – it’s almost psychedelicRead moreI can’t recall when I started tasting people’s names, exactly. It began with me seeing certain foods when I heard certain words. There was a boy called Kevin in my primary school class and, whenever I’d hear his name, I’d see an image of bacon – which is odd, because I didn’t know about the actor Kevin Bacon back then. I do remember I was always particularly good at remembering names. My primary school teacher was fascinated by the fact that I could recite the register backwards.I can’t pinpoint exactly when I started actually tasting foods on my tongue when I heard people’s names – it must have been in early adulthood – but I can remember the lightbulb moment I found out it was an actual known phenomenon. I was 28 and visiting the Melbourne Museum when I happened to walk into an exhibition on synaesthesia and some of the most common forms like grapheme-colour. As I read about it, my brain lit up. I yelled out to my parents, this is me, this is what I have! Even though there was no mention of my form of the phenomenon, something in me knew it was what I had. It was the most exciting thing I’d ever read.There are two forms of lexical-gustatory synaesthesia: some people just see the image of a certain food when they hear a certain word. For others, that word triggers an actual taste on their tongue.I seem to have both forms, depending on the word. Bob, for example, tastes like a milk chocolate Easter egg on my tongue. For the name Adrian, I get toilet cleaner – but I don’t actually taste it, thank goodness.View image in fullscreen‘Naming my children was tough, for obvious reasons’: Monique Todorovski.Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The GuardianNaming my children was tough, for obvious reasons. Lucas, my son’s name, tastes like a very ripe banana being squashed or mashed, and for me that texture is OK because I like bananas. My daughter Alyssa’s name is trickier because it has to be spelled a specific way to taste OK. For Elissa, for example, I see a blister that needs to be popped. Her father and I eventually settled on Alyssa, which brings up an image of autumn leaves falling. I can’t taste anything when I hear her name but I can feel the crunch of it.There are some words I prefer not to say because they don’t feel nice in my mouth – my first home was on Chewings Street, which tasted like a piece of gum that had lost its flavour. Others will come up and feel like ice-cream. Fellow, for example, feels soft and pillowy, like marshmallows in my hand. It’s not a conscious thing and I wouldn’t say it’s particularly useful day-to-day. But it can make a fun party trick. Sometimes, friends will call me out of the blue and say: “Hey, I’m with my cousin Sarah, what taste does she bring up for you?”I often wonder whether there are any other elements of my being that are linked to my synaesthesia. My sensitivity to smell, for example.Facebook groups such as Synaesthesia World have helped me to find a community and understand my brain better over the last decade or so. I’ve chatted to people with everything from grapheme-colour synaesthesia to auditory-visual synaesthesia but I am yet to meet another lexical-gustatory synaesthete in person. I’d love to, because I think we’d have the most fascinating conversation – as long as they have a nice-tasting name, of course.Anina Rich, a cognitive neuroscientist and chair ofthe Synaesthesia Research Group at Macquarie University, assisted in reporting this seriesExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleThe way I feelHealth & wellbeingPsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A 0% gin brings some botanical notes to proceedings, but the syrup also works wonderfully just topped with soda water. You’ll need to start the syrup a day ahead.Beetroot and sumac shrubServes1For the beetroot and sumac syrup100mlfresh beetroot juice100gcaster sugar30g sumac100mlfresh lemonFor the shrub50ml beetroot and sumac syrup(see above and method)25ml 0% gin– we useGordon’s Dry 00Soda water, to taste1 rosemary sprig, to garnishPut all the ingredients for the syrup in a saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer and leave to cook for five minutes, stirring so the sugar dissolves. Decant into a clean jar, seal and put in the fridge overnight. The next day, fine strain the syrup, ideally through a piece of muslin, into a second clean jar (or airtight container) and seal. It will keep for a week in the fridge, or a month in the freezer.To build the drink, measure the syrup and 0% gin into a shaker filled with ice, then shake until the shaker is cold to the touch.

Granted, I’m not necessarily reaching for anything too rich or heavy, but when I’m craving a bit of sweetness, the likes of this yoghurt panna cotta really hit the spot. If you squint, it could easily be mistaken for a fun breakfast pot.Yoghurt panna cotta with banana and tahini crumbleThe crumble will make more than you need for this, so save the leftovers in an airtight container for a handy crunchy snack.Prep5 minChill2 hr+Cook50 minMakes4For the panna cotta2gelatine sheets300gwhipping cream60ghoney1 tspvanilla bean pastePinch of salt300g Greek yoghurtFor the tahini crumble80g jumbo oats50g plain flour40g light brown sugar2 tbsp sesame seedsPinch flaky sea salt¼ tsp ground cinnamon50g unsalted butter,melted30g tahini2½ tbsp honey2 small bananas,slicedPut the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water, leave to soak for five minutes, until softened, then drain, squeeze out any excess water and set aside.Put the cream, honey, vanilla and salt in a small pan and heat gently until hot, but not boiling.

How do I reframe this?Big life questions tend to squeeze us at this time of year, writes advice columnistEleanor Gordon-Smith, but a baby is a person not a symbolRead moreLeading questionsEleanor Gordon-SmithThu 1 Jan 2026 19.31 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 00.45 ESTShareI’m turning 29 soon and the first of my friends is having a baby in the new year. This news has prompted a lot of self reflection. I’m pretty ambivalent about having a child myself but also feel like it’s the next milestone. I feel a great deal of pressure to decide whether or not to have a child – but this is largely self-inflicted. Unlike others I don’t have family asking this question.I know I have a few years to decide on this (and might not be lucky enough to be able to have a child in the event), so how can I reframe my thinking and be straightforwardly happy for my friend without feeling the pressure to decide what I want to do with the rest of my life?Eleanor says:The new year, the next milestone, the new life stage; all these different vices to make us feel squeezed by the question: “Am I where Ishouldbe in life?”I think the fact that you feel uncertain now really matters. There are some big life changes that you can leap into despite ambivalence – Should I move country? Change my job? – and there are some big life changes where the ambivalence itself makes the choice.How do I talk to my conservative grandsons who dismiss my politics as fuzzy thinking? | Leading questionsRead moreIn the case of having children, the gamble of “doing it despite ambivalence” doesn’t just affect you. A kid isn’t in the first instance a milestone. A kid is a person; a person who’ll be able to tell if their parent regretted their existence. Yes, you’ll hear stories of blissfully converted ambivalence; parents who weren’t sure about being parents until they looked into their newborn’s eyes. But there are also stories that people are less eager to share because they’re so hard to say out loud; parents who gambled on uncertainty, wished they hadn’t, and made their child pay a lifelong tax for that regret. I think the rules for whether to create a person permit a lot less leaping despite ambivalence than the other big life changes. We sometimes bundle all these “life stage” things – kids, relationships, career – as questions about whatIshould do withmylife, when really having a child is a question about whether to create someoneelse’slife.That very fact might give you the strategy you wanted; a way to reframe this so it doesn’t just feel like awful pressure to decide the rest of your life. Perhaps instead of running headlong into the question, the goal could be to make it feel less of a leap. Start with smaller, information-gathering questions. Not, “do I want kids” but, “how do I feel when I spend an afternoon watching my friend with their baby?” “How would I feel if some omniscient 8-ball told me that kids weren’t in my future; relieved or deprived?” “If Ididhave kids, which parts would be not-negotiable? Would I need to be near my own family; would I want to have a partner; would I adopt?” “What kind of parent would I want to be; how close am I to that now?”Thinking through some of these first-stage questions can be less panicking and overwhelming. The goal is to sort of sneak up on the big question sideways, so as not to startle it; to ask smaller, practical questions about what having a child is like materially, instead of treating it as a huge frightening symbol for “whereIought to be”.Once that’s your relationship with the question, it’s a lot easier to separate it from your feelings about your friend’s new baby. You asked how you could be “straightforwardly happy” for them, but I don’t think that needs to be the goal. It’s really common to feel poignant or compared or even envious when friends go through big life changes. Instead of chasing those feelings away with a broomstick, it might be interesting to allow them (privately), for long enough to ask whether they’re really reactions to having a child, or just reactions to the pressures of life progression.It sounds like at the moment, whether to have children feels like an iteration of that same tightening, squeezing, question; am I where Ishouldbe in life?But we can do a lot of damage by treating big life decisions as symbols. You should make this decision because you want to, not because of what it represents.Ask Eleanor a questionExplore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleLeading questionsFamilyFriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Riding the full Tour de France route withRide Le Loopwas tough, but the incredible staff turned it into an unforgettable experience (riders can tackle individual stages too). Their infectious enthusiasm and constant encouragement kept spirits high, even on the hardest climbs. They not only looked after logistics but created a warm, positive atmosphere that bonded riders together and amplified the joy of the journey. My advice: pick an organised challenge where the team cares as much about your success as you do.

I booked a week there to get a feel of the city and culture but the race itself allows you to do this, passing modern and ancient landmarks on the route. A £50 entry fee secures you free use of public transport on the day of the race, including ferries. The start is so spectacular, with runners streaming west across the 15 July Martyrs Bridgeas the water laps below, heading towards Beşiktaş then to the Dolmabahçe Palace on the coast road hugging the banks of the Bosphorus. I found it inspiring to look up as I ran to see the city skyline with its majestic minarets glistening in the sunshine, seeming to urge us on. The Golden Horn and the beautiful Blue Mosque beckoned me onwards to the finishing line where delicious Turkish tea, meze and figs served by the race organisers and supportive spectators awaited all runners. The 2026 race is on 1 November.AprilSwimming in Lord Byron’s wake, ItalyView image in fullscreenThe village of Portovenere on the Gulf of Poets is the starting point of the Coppa Byron swim.Photograph: Kirk Fisher/AlamyI was lucky enough to live in Genoa for several years and participated in the most poetical swim of my life in more ways than one. TheCoppa Byronis an annual swim across the Gulf of Poets, from Portovenere to Lerici, to commemorate the legendary aquatic feat of Lord Byron when he was visiting his friend Percy Shelley back in the 19th century. It happens on a Sunday at the end of July or early August (2026 not yet announced) when the water is warm and the views are to die for. Anyone can do it for an entry fee of about €20 (depending on when you register), which includes a swimming cap, drinking water, advice and a completion certificate. The 8km crossing takes 2-3 hours and there are boats accompanying the swimmers for support. All participants are greeted by cheering well-wishers on arrival in Lerici, where a hearty lunch is on offer at theRistorante delle Palme.NickTrekking Kilimanjaro the right wayView image in fullscreenGuides and porters approaching Barranco Camp on Mount Kilimanjaro.Photograph: Room the Agency/AlamyTheLemosho routeup Kilimanjaro takes trekkers through rainforests, moorland and alpine desert, with lots of opportunities for spotting wildlife including monkeys, antelope and beautiful birds. The effects of altitude can hit anyone, but taking a longer route makes this a challenge achievable for most fit and trained walkers. The summit day is long, but the adrenaline will see you through, and there is no technical climbing anywhere on the route. However, be aware that there are a lot of unscrupulous operators offering quick trips up Kilimanjaro, treks that don’t provide enough acclimatisation time, using poorly treated staff. I paid a premium to do the climb withIan Taylor Trekkingand am so glad I did – the conditions were great for trekkers and I was reassured that the staff supporting us were well paid and equipped, with good training to support their career development. Other good companies exist – do your research!PamelaThe scenic route from the Dolomites to Venice on two wheelsView image in fullscreenPadua at dusk.Photograph: Sean Pavone/AlamyWe recently cycled 200 miles from Bolzano to Venice – the scenic route. Starting in the dramatic scenery of the Dolomites, we then pedalled through lanes surrounded by vineyards. We sampled soave and valpolicella wines at unhurried lunchtimes. Descending southward, we enjoyed a ferry passage along the beautiful Lake Garda on our way to Verona, city of Romeo and Juliet. We loved exploring the architectural genius of Palladio in Vicenza, before continuing on to Padua, cradle of the arts. After a wonderful week with all our luggage and hotels taken care of by cycling specialistsGirolibero, we reached the Venetian lagoon, and the timeless beauty of Venice.David Innes-WilkinAbseil from London’s highest helipadView image in fullscreenAbseiling down the Royal London Hospital.Photograph: Mark Thomas/AlamyHitting my 70s, I was keen to do a charity challenge.

Surely not a feasible plan for a glaringly average runner like me. But the marathon in question was the iconicMarathon du Médoc, a festival-esque affair north of Bordeaux with more than 20 stops that allow runners to savour the Gironde region’s world-famous red wine and cuisine. The dealmaker? Each stop allows access to the grounds of the area’s most beautiful chateaux, a timeless elegance that is re-dressed each September with the arrival of 8,500 raucous participants in fancy dress. The estuary town of Pauillac is the central base for the race, and, of course, the surrounding countryside is best enjoyed with a bottle of bordeaux red, gifted enthusiastically at the finish line of this brilliantly festive affair.

When we do shift work, we’re going against what our natural rhythms want us to do.”This is true not just for those who work in the dead of night, but for those who work early and evening shifts. It means, says Lockley, “you’re not sleeping at the right time. Night shifts are the worst example, but all of these [shift patterns] move away from the circadian desire to keep a stable sleep-wake cycle.”The knock-on effects on systemic health are many: “We know that shift workers have a higher risk of heart disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, stroke, depression, anxiety and some types of cancer.” The WorldHealthOrganization has classified shift work as “probably carcinogenic”. Depression is more likely. Working nights can raise cortisol levels, and impair cognition and memory. “When you mess up the circadian clock, you mess up all the systems it controls. For example, shift workers were at a much higher risk of contracting Covid that led to hospitalisation than non-shift workers,” says Lockley. Shift workers are more likely to smoke, and more likely to have relationship breakdowns.Many shift working jobs are essential, but lots are not. “So the first question for society is: should we have shift work?” says Lockley. Yes if it’s for the emergency services, and hospital and care work. It’s harder to justify for restaurants, supermarkets, 24-hour news and radio, many cleaning staff, online shopping warehouse pickers, and all the other conveniences of modern life.In a survey of workers from five unions by Sian Moore, professor of work and employment at Anglia Ruskin University, some said that working nights fits in with their life, “but even then, when you talk to them about their sleep, it’s pretty appalling”. It’s a “constrained choice”, she says – it was part of their job description, or people would take night shifts for the extra money, and many did it for childcare reasons, including being able to make school runs.So if shift work is probably here to stay, “it’s about what you can do to mitigate it”, says Russell Foster, director of the Sir Jules ThornSleepand Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford, and author of Life Time, about the human body clock. More frequent health checks for long-term night shift workers, especially focusing on type 2 diabetes and obesity, should be done, he says, to spot “issues before they become chronic”. Employers should provide this, but if they don’t, an individual would do well to “take that seriously, particularly in the areas of metabolic abnormalities, where the data is clear.”Lockley suggests taking steps to avoid accidents when working nights. “We know that night shift workers have a higher risk of accidents and injuries [at work], and they have a higher risk of a crash, particularly on the drive home,” says Lockley. One study found that after four consecutive night shifts, the risk of workplace injuries was 36% higher. Medical errors are more common on night shifts, staffed by fatigued doctors and nurses, raising patient safety concerns; night-time healthcare workers are also more likely to suffer “needlestick” or sharps injuries than those working during the day.View image in fullscreenMore thought should be given to rota patterns, says Lockley.Photograph: Posed by models; Maskot/Getty ImagesThese immediate dangers can be tackled by companies and institutions. In Australia, where Foster was a visiting professor, he was struck by how hospitals would provide taxis for people to get home, eliminating the need to drive home while trying to stay awake. People who are driving after a night shift should be provided with a device or app that monitors eye roll and head nodding (or signs of “microsleeps”), he says.More thought should be given to rota patterns, says Lockley. “There are worse and better ways to design a shift rota.” Employees’ night shifts should be minimised, and the transition between day and night should be managed. “Going from day to evening to nights is better. Try to avoid quick returns, where someone does an evening shift tonight and the morning shift tomorrow.” When he did a study with a healthcare trust, applying those rules to resident doctor schedules, “we saw about a 30% fall in serious medical errors because we reorganised the shift patterns in a more circadian-friendly way”.Lighting in the workplace is another key factor. Cooler, bluish light, “makes the brain think it’s daytime, essentially. Just looking at the lightbulbs in the workplace would be a good way to start to look at alertness on duty”. Lockley also says that while screening for sleep disorders can improve the health of all employees, it may have a greater impact for those working nights. “If you have an undiagnosed sleep disorder, then you’re not going to sleep as well, you’re not going to recover, and you’re going to be more sleepy at work.”Your natural chronotype – whether you’re an owl or lark, feeling more alert in the evening or the morning – will affect how you deal with a night shift, but very few people, even the most owlish, can adapt to working nights. Foster says 97% of people can’t. One study showed that oil rig workers – who work under bright lights at night, then sleep in dark windowless rooms in the day – can adjust towards the end of a two-week stint of working nights, but very few people, points out Lockley, can or would want to “live in a completely nocturnal way. When you’ve got days off, holidays, gaps between shifts, you end up reverting back”.Many employers are taking the harms of night shift working seriously (Lockley is working with St George’s hospital in London, which has been awarded a grant to develop a health programme for night shift workers). But there is a sense, says Moore, that many employers are failing to protect staff. “Some of the fatigue assessments that were done in the past aren’t being done properly. People would have physical checkups, which are often now just done by surveys. Occupational health [services], something that might have been in place before, is not there. I feel things have got worse.”In any case, it usually falls to individuals to put measures in place to survive the night shift. It’s hard to give generic advice, says Lockley, because so much is dependent on the shift itself, preceding shifts, a person’s chronotype and other variables (he has developed an app, Timeshifter, for jet lag and shift work, in which someone can put this type of information in to get an individual programme, including helping you plan when to seek light and caffeine).But there are some broad rules. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is key, but eating well on a night shift when often the only food available is from takeaways or vending machines is notoriously difficult. There isn’t much evidence for taking supplements, except for vitamin D (shift workers don’t get as much sunlight). Exercise is vital. “There’s a study that [showed] that night shift workers who exercised and had a healthy lifestyle generally reduced their chances of developing type 2 diabetes,” says Foster – to only just above the average level of someone who doesn’t work night shifts.One often-overlooked side-effect of night working is the impact on relationships and family life. In her survey into the effects of night shift working, Moore received reports of one parent finishing a shift and the other “literally handing over the child in a car park, on their way to work. That’s obviously very difficult”. Although shift working can reduce childcare costs, “at the same time, it’s having a big impact on the quality of relationships with children”. And with partners – one study found divorce and separation was six times more likely for men working night shifts in the first five years of marriage. Education, says Foster, is really important, “not only for the employee, so they can make a decision about whether the extra money is worth the health risks, but also for the people they share their lives with.”While on a night shift, naps can help – if you’re able to take one – but timing is important. There are two processes driving sleep, says Foster – the circadian rhythm, and sleep pressure (the longer you’ve been awake, the greater the need for sleep). “A 20-minute nap will increase your performance and ability to function,” says Foster. The problem is that if you’re chronically tired – as many shift workers are – “you tend to drop very quickly into deep sleep, and waking from that can leave you groggy and actually be counterproductive. A 10-minute nap is perhaps all you go for.” Having a nap too close to the end of your shift could hold off the sleep pressure, detrimentally, but by then for most people, says Foster, “the sleep pressure is probably so high that getting off to sleep won’t be too much of an issue.” It’s probably safer, though, to take a short nap before work.Caffeine could also make getting to sleep at the end of your shift harder. “The general advice tends to be to use it little and often,” says Lockley. By little, he means 0.3mg per kilo of body weight, so about 21mg an hour for a 70kg person. “That’s half a can of Coke, half a weak tea or coffee. It’s not very much, but that amount every hour, on average, is all the caffeine you need to stay alert, and minimise the effect on sleep.” Ideally, he recommends people “stop using caffeine about six hours before they plan to sleep”.Sleeping pills are not advised, says Foster. “They sedate you, they don’t provide a biological mimic for sleep.” Many night shift workers become dependent on alcohol for the sedative effects, and the stimulant of cigarettes. Melatonin is sometimes prescribed for sleep problems and jet lag symptoms, but Foster says it’s often misunderstood. “It is not a ‘sleep hormone’, it is a biological marker of the ‘dark’ and a very mild modulator of sleep. In the study showing the greatest efficacy, it reduced the time it took to get to sleep by 20 minutes, but that doesn’t happen with everybody.” Foster also points out thatone recent studysuggested people with long-term use of melatonin were at higher risk of heart failure. “That’s the first real evidence that melatonin is bad for you.”In the past, wearing dark glasses on the way home in daylight, was thought to aid subsequent sleep, but Lockley points out increasing sleepiness en route is dangerous (most accidents happen close to home). “That light is keeping you awake and keeping you alive,” he says – whether you’re driving, or crossing the road.Coming off a night shift, the usual sleep hygiene advice remains – create a calm and dark sleep environment, and have a wind-down period. Turn your phone off, and make sure friends and family know not to disturb you. Earplugs will probably help to block out the daytime noises. Don’t be tempted to do a few jobs around the house when you get home. “The longer you wait after a night shift,” says Lockley, “the harder it is to fall asleep, and the shorter you’ll sleep.” Of course, then it might be time to do it all over again. It’s a small consolation, but with the days getting longer again, the life of night shift workers won’t be led almost entirely in the dark.Explore more on these topicsHealthHow to have a better daySleepWork & careersHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I always knew I was adopted: my mum told me that, as well as her, I had my “tummy mummy”. I was adopted from the Dominican Republic. My mum there was called Julianna, and she and my dad gave me up for adoption because they were poor.Fast-forward to 2013, and I was 24 and working in a restaurant in New Haven. One day, one of my co‑ workers, Julia, noticed my Dominican Republic flag tattoo. She told me she was from there, too. I said I was adopted from there, and she said she was as well.Julia was 23 – we’re 17 months apart. We hit it off right away. People would always tell us we looked alike. We would joke and say: “That’s because we’re sisters.”We decided to compare our adoption paperwork, but our birth mother’s names were different, as was the place we were born. It was anticlimactic. After that, we let it go. We only worked together for about six months, but stayed in touch.I still hadn’t given up hope of locating my biological family. In 2018, my mum got me a 23andMe kit for Christmas. About three weeks later, my results were ready. I discovered I had a first cousin once-removed in Connecticut. I clicked on his 23andMe profile and it said: “If you were adopted from the Dominican Republic, I might be able to find your family.”I messaged him and asked if he could help. He replied and told me his mum was my mum’s cousin, and they had been good friends. He said that my mum had passed away since, but my dad was still alive, and I had lots of siblings.We met up two weeks after we found out. I get goosebumps thinking about that momentNews travelled fast. Suddenly, I had all these Facebook friend requests from new relatives, including seven siblings. At the time, I didn’t speak Spanish, so a friend came over to translate. I had a video call with one of my new sisters and it was like looking in a mirror.A few days later, I talked to my dad for the first time. It was amazing. We both cried. He said: “I want you to know that your mum and I always thought about you.”I flew out to the Dominican Republic to meet everyone in March 2019. I felt as if I was going to throw up – I was scared, nervous and excited. They were the most loving people.A year later, I got a message from someone named Molly, who was also adopted from the Dominican Republic. Her paperwork said her birth mother had the same name as mine. She thought we might be related, although we didn’t look alike. She did a DNA test – it showed we didn’t have the same parents.But that interaction revived an old nagging suspicion of mine. I video-called my dad to ask if he had given up another girl for adoption; he looked as if somebody had taken the wind out of him. He said that they had, and told me about her. Julia fitted his description. I couldn’t believe it.I just knew she had to be Julia. Since then, I had moved away from Connecticut to Virginia, but we’d stayed good friends.I got in touch and convinced her to take a DNA test.Two and a half weeks later, in January 2021, the results came back. She called me and said: “Are you ready? We are sisters.” I lost it. I couldn’t stop crying.Experience: I stopped a man from crashing our planeRead moreWe met up two weeks later. I get goosebumps thinking about that moment. We weren’t meeting as friends any more, but as sisters. We think our birth papers got mixed up – maybe Molly, the woman who had contacted me earlier, had ended up with Julia’s papers.In October 2022, I went with Julia to the Dominican Republic to meet our family. Everyone was waiting for us at the airport wearing T-shirts with a picture of us on them. My dad scooped her up – it was a beautiful moment.I always wanted to find my family, but never in a million years did I think that this would be how it happened. Now, Julia lives in California and I live in Virginia – we’re 2,500 miles apart, but we FaceTime all the time.Sometimes I think about what would have happened if Julia and I hadn’t met. I think I would have found my family regardless, but I don’t know if I would have found her. Even now, it still doesn’t feel real – I can’t believe she’s my little sister.As told to Isabelle AronDo you have an experience to share?

In 2026 I’m lowering my standardsNo over-buying or rigid planning. Here is my list of things Iwon’tbe doing in the garden this yearClaire RatinonFri 2 Jan 2026 06.30 ESTShareEvery January, I gripe about the tyranny of setting any kind of resolution while we’re in the depth of winter. Short gloomy days and long drawn-out nights are a truly uninspiring backdrop for resolving to make meaningful changes in your life. I’d love to meet whoever came up with the idea of new year resolutions and give them a piece of my mind.So I want to try something else this January. I want to make a list of things I’m giving up. Not the punishing kind of giving up. I’m not planning to give up any of the delicious things that I’ve happily overeaten these last few weeks. Instead, I’m going to give up doing the things that make me – and more specifically, my veg patch – feel less than good enough.First I’m giving up growing winter squash. Now I love this vegetable. I like to cook and eat them, and I’ve enjoyed growing them in the market gardens and farms I’ve worked on over the years. But in my tiny patch, they never seem to thrive. It’s entirely my fault, of course, as I’m trying to grow them cheek-to-cheek with too many other plants. They need space to thrive, and I can’t give it to them, so I’m going to get ahead of this season’s frustration and give up on this lovely but elusive crop for now.I’m going to give up planting with a strict plan and impulse-buying more seeds than I can really growI’m also going to give up impulse‑buying more seeds than I can realistically grow. I likely won’t give this up for long – but right now, I have a seed box that is bulging and disorganised. So I’m going to be more reserved in my seed shopping until I’ve discerned which of the seeds I already own are viable and can be sown this season, and which are not and need replenishing. There will be special dispensation for exciting varieties or crops I haven’t grown yet, as long as I don’t buy too many or anything that needs a lot of space (see non-resolution No 1).Next, I’m giving up planting with a strict plan. In contrast with the crop rotation that’s key to the organic growing I was trained in, I’ve found myself becoming more flexible with where I put my plants. While I’ll still try to avoid growing the same crop in the same bed back-to-back, I’m going to embrace the “pop a happy seedling where there happens to be a gap” approach that has seen my veg patch become a somewhat chaotic but nonetheless delicious place, filled with the biodiversity we all ought to be prioritising.Last year I found the vegetable patch and garden to be a place of disappointment, likely because the expectations I’d subconsciously set weren’t realistic given how the year was unfolding. Perhaps with a more gentle and less meticulous approach, I’ll be able to enjoy whatever the coming season has to offer.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensNew yearfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Action Man, complete with a macho painted-on scar and fatigues, won the battle for Toy of the Year.But for Rylands, who has died aged 83 after suffering from vascular dementia, the future of children’s play was not to be found in camouflage or tiny guns, but in the translucent, jewel-toned geometry and simplicity of his first toy design, PlayPlax. A quiet revolution of simple interlocking squares – designed while he was still at college – it offered a defiant modernist “less” response to the toy world’s “more is more” approach.While the mass market careered toward battery-operated dolls that spoke and cars that crashed, Rylands’s innovative focus on the abstract, rather than the literal, was rewarded in sales: by 1970, PlayPlax had sold more than a million units.View image in fullscreenPlayPlax squares, invented by Rylands in 1966.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThroughout his career Rylands remained true to this vision. He continued to focus on condensing complex ideas into effortless simplicity. “A toy that does everything by itself, does nothing for the child,” he said. “The main purpose of a toy is to enable children to enter into a world of make-believe, as it is in this way that children relate to reality.”Born in Hull, East Yorkshire, one of the five children of Ada (nee Hyde) and Leo Rylands, a salesman, Patrick was educated at the Marist college, a Catholic grammar school in the city. “I hated school,” he said later. “When I was about to leave my art master said: ‘You might get into art school if you try’ – the alternative was to join the police – I was the perfect height.”He attended Hull College of Art before moving to London to pursue an MA in ceramics at the Royal College of Art. There he met Ljiljana Momcilovic, a fellow student, who was to become a skilled illustrator. The couple married in 1966 in the Serbian Orthodox church in Bradford, though they were to live for many decades in Belsize Park, London.View image in fullscreenRylands’s duck bath toy.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIn 1970, Rylands became the youngest ever recipient of the Duke of Edinburgh’s prize for ElegantDesign(now the Prince Philip Designers prize) for the range of toys he produced for the Trendon company, which included PlayPlax and the slotted LittleMen figures. The judges praised his ability to introduce young children to concepts of form, balance and transparency through objects that felt as good to hold as they looked.In 1999, Rylands was elected a Royal Designer for Industry (RDI) by the Royal Society of Arts – the highest accolade for designers in the UK. It was a fitting acknowledgment of a “designers’ designer” who approached the engineering of a bath toy duck with the same rigour that another might afford a skyscraper.Unusually, he worked without prototypes, moving straight from complex mechanical drawings to the final toolmakers. This precision and ability to condense complex materials and designs resulted in items such as his Bird and Fish bath toys – beautifully weighted sculptures in ABS plastic that he once described as “the least you can do to a bit of plastic and still make it usable”.View image in fullscreenCool Cat rolls along the floor.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianIf Rylands had a design golden age, it began in 1976 when he joined the Dutch company AmbiToys. For 30 years as chief designer, Rylands was the force behind the simple and yet profoundly influential aesthetic. He stuck to a limited palette of primary colours – red, blue, yellow and white – chosen because of their clarity to developing eyes.His approach also stood out among the increasing “pinkification” of gendered toy aisles and toys powered by batteries and microchips. He was always a purist, and his most famous Ambi creations – including Duck Family, where three miniature ducks nest inside a larger one, and Tommy Toot, the simple, melodic whistle – were defined by smooth lines and intrinsic playability.At home in Belsize Park, he was an obsessive and joyful collector, amassing an archive that celebrated the history of human ingenuity. It included a fine collection of Victorian glass marbles – their swirling transparent colours finding their echo in his PlayPlax designs – as well as 1930s American radios, intricate automatons and a 7ft-high music box. It was a collection driven by a lifelong fascination with how things were made, and a testament to his belief that even the smallest, most simple object deserved to be beautiful.View image in fullscreenThe Magic Man roly-poly toy.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianHis work is held in the collections of theYoung V&Ain east London andMoMAin New York, and his designs were showcased as examples of the best of British innovation in the 2012 London Olympics.After Ljiljana’s death in 2009, Rylands moved to Royal Leamington Spa to live near his sister, Josephine, who survives him. His three brothers, Michael, Tony and Paul, predeceased him.In bathtubs and nurseries, his toys continue to float, rock and slide. “Toys should give children the freedom to play,” he said. His own designs demonstrated that if you give a child a simple, elegant tool, you are giving them the freedom to build their own world.Patrick Rylands, toy designer, born 12 September 1942; died 11 December 2025Explore more on these topicsToysDesignobituariesShareReuse this content"

For classic rock collective Hardwicke Circus, it was a no-brainer: ‘We thought they’d like to hear some rock’n’roll’Fri 2 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 10.05 ESTShareIt is late October and, 10 kilometres from the frontline in Donetsk, eastUkraine, the inhabitants of a reconditioned ambulance are completely lost. While opening your phone and logging on to a maps app might appear the obvious solution, this would be extremely unwise here: Russian drones are overhead and hunting for any signals.Inside the van are a motley crew: an 81-year-old Irish music industry veteran; a 72-year-old Texas rocker; an Australian keyboardist; a Ukrainian saxophonist; and three twenty-something musicians from Carlisle, Cumbria. Their destination is a military base where they are to perform for Ukrainian troops.Dave Robinson, the Irishman, likens the wayward nature of the tour to when he was managing Jimi Hendrix in 1968. Joe “King” Carrasco, the ebullient Texan, compares it to “playing for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua when they were fighting the Contras”. For the younger, less experienced inhabitants of the ambulance, though, it is a mighty long way from Carlisle and Melbourne to this bleak, chilly no man’s land.“We were more excited than anything,” reflects Jonny Foster, lead singer and guitarist of Hardwicke Circus – now safely back home in Carlisle – as he, alongside Robinson and Carrasco, discuss over a video call what it was like to traverse these real highways to hell. “We just wanted to do our bit to support Ukraine’s war effort and thought the locals might enjoy hearing a live rock’n’roll band.”Hardwicke Circus toured war-torn Ukraine in June of this year, the only British musicians to have done so. The experience made them determined to return, thus their late October-early November trek. The band didn’t undertake these tours to generate money – all proceeds were donated to local Ukrainian charities – nor as a publicity stunt. “We once toured British prisons,” says Foster, “for the same reason: we believe music is both entertainment and art, and all people should have access to it.”View image in fullscreenLiving on the frontline … Hardwicke Circus and their new fans in Ukraine.Photograph: Veronika ZolotoverkhaTeenage brothers Jonny and Tom Foster formed Hardwicke Circus in 2015, and since then have self-released three albums, plus a live-in-Ukraine LP, One Hour Ahead of the Posse. Their classic rock sound might not be fashionable – their sax-accompanied narrative songs suggest Thin Lizzy or mid-1970s era Bruce Springsteen – but regular touring has seen them gather a loyal following. Paul McCartneyasked for Glastonbury to add them to its 2022 lineup(they closed that year’s festival playing the Rabbit Hole stage to a rapturous audience) while Bob Dylan added them to the bill of his Hyde Park concert in 2019.The Fosters were inspired to tour Ukraine after performing in the Czech Republic earlier this year. “We were naive,” admits Jonny, “and thought Ukraine was a short drive over the Czech border – it’s 1,000km across Poland! Back in Carlisle we contacted Derek Eland, a Cumbrian painter who had done a lot to support Ukraine. He linked us with Okazia, a female rock trio in Ukraine, and we approached them about playing dates together. They loved the idea and it became the quickest tour we’ve ever booked!”Remarkably the band weren’t warned off the trip by the UK Foreign Office. “We were waiting to hear someone shout ‘Don’t go!’” says Robinson, “but nobody did. People think we’re mad as a box of snakes” – he laughs – “and maybe we are.”Still they did hit a snag: Hardwicke Circus’s non-Foster members refused to tour Ukraine. “Four of our band got scared,” says Foster, “and their mums forbade them to go.”“Which is understandable,” adds Robinson.“Yeah,” agrees Foster, “Saying, ‘Do you want to come and play in a war zone for no money?’ isn’t appealing to most people.”We knew we weren’t going to end the war, but seeing people sing along, the tension draining from their faces, made it worthwhileInstead the brothers reached out to former member Bill Wilde and Australian keyboardist Conor Morrissey – both London-based – who subsequently signed on. Also joining on guitar was Carrasco, a Tex-Mex musician who has dedicated his life to rocking all over the world. “I started playing in bands as a teenager,” he recalls, “and since then I’ve played everywhere – all over Latin America, Botswana, Zimbabwe, India, Cambodia, Morocco.”The Carrasco connection came via the band’s manager, Dave Robinson, a music industry veteran who is best known for co-founding and managing Stiff Records, the London-based indie label that launched Elvis Costello, Ian Dury, Kirsty MacColl, the Pogues and Madness (who Robinson signed after they played his wedding, then directed their groundbreaking videos).Stiff released Joe “King” Carrasco’s eponymous 1980 album, which failed to match the success of the aforementioned artists. “Joe’s always been a brilliant performer and total rock’n’roller,” says Robinson. “The UK wasn’t ready for him in 1980, but this didn’t faze him.”Carrasco did get a taste of US success: having signed to MCA, he found his videos were played on the fledgling MTV channel, while Michael Jackson sang backing vocals on his 1982 album Synapse Gap (Mundo Total). “We were both recording at the same Hollywood studio complex. Michael was a nice guy who had incredible mic technique,” Carrasco says. “He had a white Rolls-Royce and there were all these teen girls hanging around his car. Michael seemed perplexed by it all.”Carrassco’s brush with fame proved fleeting, ensuring he continued playing bars and touring where most acts never ventured. Robinson invited him to join his youthful charges playing UK dates in 2022. “Great band, in it for all the right reasons,” Carrasco says of Hardwicke Circus.“When Joe heard we were planning to tour Ukraine he said: ‘Count me in’,” says Foster. “He’s really committed to singing for the people.”“And I’m committed to dogs,” adds Carrasco: having discovered in June how Ukraine is now home to many abandoned canines, he subsequently raised funds to buy large amounts of pet food for animal shelters. “We took pet food to one dog shelter just three kilometres from the frontline,” he says. “Here we could feel the intensity of the struggle – that this conflict is a war between good and evil – with the Russians and North Koreans very nearby.”The June tour of Ukraine, which saw the band play eight dates from Lviv in the west to Kharkiv in the north-east, was, all three agree, life-affirming. “We knew we weren’t going to end the war,” says Robinson, “but seeing people smile and sing along, the tension draining from their faces, that made it worthwhile. “Our most popular number was one we’d originally written about Tyson Fury but, for the tour, we changed it to be about Oleksandr Usyk.”Afternoon acoustic concerts in hospitals and schools added another dimension to the tour. “We wanted to bring some light relief to people who have been through so much,” says Foster. “One afternoon we played a set at an amputee hospital and there, lying on a stretcher, was a soldier who had recently had his left leg amputated – blood was seeping through his bandages. He was singing along with us and applauding. That was incredibly moving.”At another venue, a school workshop, they met an autistic teenage girl who was traumatised from having lived for a long period under Russian occupation. ”She really responded when we played music. So much so that we invited her to sing with us, Her teacher later said that our performance saw her begin coming out of her shell.”The impact the June tour made on Hardwicke Circus ensured that they were determined to do it again. “We considered waiting until winter was over,” says Robinson, “but thought: No, let’s show our support now. And off we went.”This time the tour involved plenty of prep: the support of several Carlisle businesses and general fundraising saw the purchase of two emergency evacuation vehicles to donate to the Ukrainian military. Leaving Carlisle, it took the band five days to drive the SUVs, alongside a band van – “Jonny had bought a complete banger for tuppence,” notes Robinson – to Lviv, where warning signs of the forthcoming eastern winter greeted them. “It was getting really cold, heavy rains, and the Russians were doing their worst before winter really kicks in,” he says.An early incident almost ended the tour – and their lives. “I was driving down a steep mountain road on a very wet night,” recalls Robinson, “and the van’s steering lost power. I had to make a snap decision, so drove into a forest road. When we got out we saw we were on the verge of a 200-metre drop. If we’d gone over that we would’ve joined Buddy Holly in rock’n’roll heaven.”With the group’s van now unsafe to drive, Adrian Simpson, a British national whose organisation Mission Aid For Ukraine had provided advice and support, stepped in. “Adrian lent us a reconditioned ambulance,” says Robinson, “and, as we were heading to Donetsk, he advised us to remove the red crosses as Russian drones seek out ambulances – it’s fucking immoral what Putin’s doing. So I got out my penknife and scratched them off.”Touring meant sirens going off, hotels with bunkers, being woken by explosions. It was intense and an incredible timeHardwicke Circus could have left the SUVs in Lviv to be collected, but instead they were determined to deliver the vehicles to military bases near the frontline. And to sing for the soldiers. “We wanted to show our solidarity with those who were doing the fighting,” says Foster. “When we delivered a vehicle to the 81st Brigade it was one of those ‘lost for words’ moments. We’d spent months fundraising and here we were giving the vehicle over to those who needed it. They signed our British flag and we signed their Brigade flag and it was all very emotional.”Travelling by ambulance proved handy as Robinson soon succumbed to pneumonia. “I woke up in hospital not knowing where I was,” he says, “and they kept me there a week. Worst food I’ve ever eaten – but they fixed me.” After eight days recuperating he travelled to Kraków in Poland and then home.The band’s bassist Wilde, meanwhile, had such bad flu that he couldn’t feel his limbs and was put on a coach to Poland. Not long after, the band’s Ukrainian saxophonist Ptashka Khromchenko needed to be hospitalised for bronchitis. The Foster brothers and keyboardist Morrissey came down with flu, meaning only Carrasco, veteran of so many tours, remained unscathed.“The weather was bitter and we were playing concerts in hospitals so picked up viruses,” says Foster. “We soldiered on – when you’re in a nation under attack you don’t complain about feeling poorly.”The concerts – held in Ternopil, Cherkasy, Dnipro, Poltava and Kyiv – were often held in subterranean venues and had to finish before the midnight curfew, and drew largely female audiences, as most men are on the frontline.“Touring meant sirens going off, staying in hotels with bunkers, hearing missiles and drones above us, being woken by explosions,” says Robinson who, even after being hospitalised, felt emboldened. “It was intense and an incredible time.”“It was dangerous, yes,” says Foster, “and there is no guide book, but we have a lot of info we can share if people want to take their art to Ukraine.”“That’s what people in the west need to do,” says Robinson. “Get out there and support Ukrainians. See how they conduct their lives during wartime.”‘For now, music is a weapon’: the Ukrainian musicians playing on as an act of resistanceRead more“Ukrainians fight hard and don’t take no shit,” says Carrasco. “They sleep in their bathtubs to avoid being sprayed with broken glass and don’t complain. Instead, they get up each morning and fight on. Alamo spirit!”After 18 days touring Ukraine and seeing this spirit, it was time for Hardwicke Circus’s surviving members to head home. After instructing the rest of the band to follow Robinson in flying out of Kraków, Foster stayed on to collect their now semi-repaired van. Packing it with band equipment, he drove for five days back to Carlisle.“I kind of collapsed when I got home,” he says. “Exhaustion – I’d driven a five-and-a-half-thousand-mile round trip! But it was worth it. And we all aim on returning to Ukraine in 2026.”“More touring without a safety net,” says Robinson. The three veterans of Hardwicke Circus’s Ukraine campaign all laugh in recognition.Hardwicke Circus continue to fundraise for Ukraine atcrowdfunder.co.uk/p/hardwicke-circusExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then, moments after the passengers disembark, there is activity in the undergrowth. A single rabbit scampers out, wholly untroubled by its two-legged visitors. And then another.A short walk along the coast takes visitors deep into rabbit territory on Okunoshima, one of 3,000 islands in Japan’s Seto Inland Sea. Half a dozen of the animals chase away another as it attempts to join them in a communal meal of Chinese cabbage. The scene unfolds in front of smiling, camera-toting tourists barely able to believe their proximity to Okunoshima’s fabled – but troubled – furry residents.The two grey rabbits that greeted the ferry from the mainland return to bushes stripped of their leaves. Shallow bowls of water left by volunteers dot the island in places where its estimated 400-500 rabbits tend to congregate in expectation of pellets of food left by visitors in the absence of their natural diet of fallen leaves, bark, roots and grass.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe rabbits are dependent on visitors and volunteers for food.For all its natural beauty and popularity as a tourist destination, Okunoshima – uninhabited except for staff working at the solitary hotel and its guests – faces an uncertain future, and so do its four-legged inhabitants.From 1929 until the end of the second world war, the island hosted poisonous gas research and production facilities run by the Japanese imperial army. The operation was so secret that Okunoshima was not included in contemporaneous maps of Japan.Map showing position of the island in Japan’s Seto Inland Sea, as one of many off the coast between Hiroshima and Fukuyama.Workers in rubber uniforms, gloves, long boots and gas masks manufactured mustard gas, and smaller quantities of teargas and cyanide.The manufacture of weapons of chemical warfare – which was not exposed until the 1980s – also marked the beginning of the island’s connection to rabbits. About 200 were used in experiments to test the efficacy of gas that Japan’s army used during the Sino-Japanese war and, later, to arm balloon bombs targeting the US.View image in fullscreenEach of the two rooms at the former poison gas storage facility above once housed a 10-tonne tank on a concrete base.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenA power plant (top left) once supplied electricity to the gas factory (samples of its pipework and components, top right); a gas mask used at the factory is displayed at the island’s museum (above, left); the largest gas storage facility on the island (above, right) once held six tanks, each with a capacity of about 100 tonnes.In the early 1970s, a nearby elementary school released a small number of rabbits on the abandoned island, hoping they would bring it back to life. In 2024, nearly 200,000 people visited Okunoshima, drawn by its eminently Instagram-friendly coastline and the promise of entering a rabbit paradise.An interest in wartime history first brought Koji Yamamoto to Okunoshima five years ago. But it is the rabbits that keep him coming back. “This is my 30th time here,” the retiree says as he watches grey rabbits gratefully devour the pellets he has put out for them.“There isn’t much natural vegetation, so I thought it would be a good idea to come regularly and feed them, especially during the winter when there aren’t many tourists.”Loop of rabbits on Okunoshima islandDefeated Japanese forces attempted to destroy evidence of their wartime activities, including exterminating their collection of white lab rabbits.Experts have not ruled out a genetic link between the rabbits experimented on in wartime and those that roam Okunoshima today. The chances are, though, “very low”, says Shingo Kaneko, a professor in the faculty of symbiotic systems science at Fukushima University, who is studying the rabbits’ DNA to learn more about their lineage.“Even if an individual rabbit survived [the wartime experiments] it would have been very difficult to continue its lineage. But I can’t say 100% no, and it’s a story that people like to believe could be true.”View image in fullscreenAhinomari yosegaki(Japanese good-luck flag) displayed at the island’s Poison Gas Museum is inscribed with ‘shuku nyūei’ (‘congratulations on your enlistment’), a phrase wishing soldiers safety and success in war, and signatures and messages from family and friends.Kaneko’s study of hundreds of droppings revealed that the rabbits have diverse DNA characteristics, suggesting that animals have been left on the island on multiple occasions, possibly by people hoping to give unwanted pets a new home.Unable to compete with larger animals for dwindling crops of natural food, the rabbits are now entirely dependent on visitors and volunteers for sustenance, according to Kaneko. “They depend on people for food, and that’s not good. There is not enough natural food,” he says. “The rabbits look happy enough in social media posts, but they have an increasingly precarious existence.”Yamamoto will not leave his spot until the rabbits have eaten every last morsel. “You have to stay with them until they’ve finished, otherwise other animals come and help themselves,” he says. The predators – usually wild boar and crows – not only eat the rabbits’ feed, but have been known to attack them.Last year, their chief tormentor was Ryu Hotta, a 25-year-old who was given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of abusing multiple rabbits by kicking them or inserting scissor blades in their mouths. Media reports said the carcasses of 77 rabbits were discovered on Okunoshima between November 2024 and January last year, although it was not clear how many had died as a result of abuse.View image in fullscreenThe lobby of Okunoshima’s only hotel.As concern grows over the future of the rabbit population, some worry that the island’s past could be forgotten.“About 85% of people who visit Okunoshima come to see the rabbits and give this place a miss,” says Kazuhito Takashima, who manages the Poison Gas Museum, where exhibits include uniforms worn by plant workers and photos of the disfigurements they suffered after exposure to dangerous chemicals. “Most Japanese people have no idea about the poisonous gas facilities … we didn’t learn about this kind of thing at school.”As the tourists leave Okunoshima on theLapinapleasure boat, they take their final photos of rabbits, whose company they will commemorate with a visit to a souvenir shop 15 minutes away across the water.“There are lots of tourists now, but there is no guarantee that will always be the case,” says Kaneko, adding that the relative dearth of visible droppings suggests the rabbit population is falling again after increase followed the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.“I feel very conflicted when I leave Okunoshima. It’s a place of darkness and light. Its connection with poisonous gas ended 80 years ago, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have problems … they are just of a different kind.”View image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsJapanAnimalsAsia PacificWildlifefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianBritish military doctors and therapists provide support at base where innovative treatments aid recovery of those who have lost limbsByDan Sabbaghin Kyiv. Photographs byJulia KochetovaFri 2 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareAt a specialist treatment centre inUkraine, as other amputees play volleyball nearby, Vladislav shows a video on his phone of how he lost his left leg. He found the footage – of a drone closing in rapidly on a buggy, Vladislav standing exposed at its rear – on a Russian military social media channel.The 31-year-old, an arbitration lawyer before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, makes a double whistling noise to describe the drone’s ominous progress. “That’s me,” he says, pointing at the video, filmed from a fibre optic drone, chasing him down with terrifying ease as the vehicle slows for a corner. Then the screen goes blank.Vladislav was driving between positions somewhere near Lyman, in the north-east of Ukraine, on 21 August when his life changed for ever. An explosion “bam on the left ear” threw him and the driver to the ground. Still conscious, he could see the injury to his left leg was obviously very serious. But this was not his immediate priority.“To be honest, I checked my crotch, if everything’s in the right place,” he says, grinning. The check was affirmative and so in that moment, the stricken soldier says, he reasoned life was worth still living. “Only after that, I turned my tourniquet.” That choked off the blood supply to his left leg, giving himself a chance of survival.0:18Video shows moment Vladislav says he was struck by Russian drone – videoThe respite was short. Once rescued, Vladislav was soon losing consciousness. “I don’t know if it’s real or a common trope, but pictured in my memory I saw a white tunnel with a light at the end.” But it was not the end. “My comrade fell on me with his elbow on my wounded leg and I opened my eyes with every curse I knew.”Dozens of seriously wounded Ukrainians such as Vladislav, who have had or need to have amputations, come to this specialist treatment centre every month. No one will say exactly how many are being treated here, but across Ukraine crude estimates suggest the total number of amputees runs well into the tens of thousands.Providing help, support and advice to Ukrainian staff at the centre are a small number of British military personnel – doctors, physiotherapists and occupational therapists from the UK’s defence medical services, part of Project Renovator. The Guardian observed some of their work during a day visit, including sessions where British practitioners discussed their use of temporary prosthetics with Ukrainian counterparts.“The numbers here are truly humbling,” says Mike, a British rehab consultant and an army lieutenant colonel, who is part of the UK team helping out. Mike worked in Afghanistan, where the British military was present until 2014, and says professionals like himself can contribute “an understanding of complex amputee rehabilitation” and “can help move their patients on to new legs quicker”.View image in fullscreenVladislav was an arbitration lawyer before Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianHe is keen to emphasise that the British presence works both ways, in that there are opportunities for him and his colleagues to learn. Thanks to a combination of innovative surgery, electrical stimulation and rehab, the Ukrainians “are managing to fix nerve injuries faster than I’ve previously seen”, he says.Britain has only minimally acknowledged a wider military presence in Ukraine, beyond its staffing at the embassy in Kyiv. Security measures around the medical crew remain tight, with only Mike able to be identified.“I’m proud that the UK is stepping up to ensure wounded Ukrainian soldiers get the best possible treatment,” said John Healey, the defence secretary, praising their work. He said their goal was to work alongside Ukrainian teams “to deliver care and rehabilitation”, an effort that will have to continue long after the war finally ends.View image in fullscreenMike, a British rehab consultant helping at the centre, says he and his colleagues can ‘help move their patients on to new legs quicker’.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianThere are a wide range of classes, and family and friends are able to visit unless the staff believe it would be unhelpful to an individual’s recovery. Part of the approach is to have “psychologically aware clinicians”, according to Mike, who can identify when patients run into mental problems. But a key part, as the volleyball shows, is being part of a group so the wounded can motivate each other.Vladislav’s case is one of the simpler. He hopes to have a final prosthetic leg ready soon and to be discharged earlythis year. He says his mental state is strong, though at some point after two or four weeks, when he was on his own, he admits, “I cried a lot”. It was “like a divorce” until he eventually thought: “Let it be.”What helped, the former lawyer says, was having his family nearby, including baby son Adam. However, he says: “I did not tell my wife about my injury for around a month and a half because she was pregnant.” Two weeks after Adam’s birth he told her what had happened, though by then she had “suspected something”, he admits.View image in fullscreenInjured veterans playing volleyball at the rehabilitation centre in Kyiv region.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianOleksandr, 48, is a former fitness teacher and swimming instructor who had both his legs amputated below the knee after an artillery shell landed close to him on 18 October 2024. After he arrived at the treatment centre, a succession of further surgeries proved necessary. One was to stabilise his wound, which had become infected; later, a metal brace was attached to the bone so the prosthetics would fit.It has been a long, gruelling treatment, including a month in intensive care, and at one point Oleksandr wells up in tears at the thought of it. “In the beginning it was hard for me just to sit in the wheelchair. I was sweating immediately,” he says. But gradually, going to the gym with rehabilitation experts helped, and at some point as his exercising gradually improved, “I knew then I would get through,” he says.There is a brightness and purpose in his eyes now but the future is uncertain. He wants to leave this year, when his legs are ready. “I hope I will be able to get back to my job as a fitness trainer,” he says. “But I just don’t know. I just need to understand what my abilities will be on the prostheses, how long I can walk. When I will learn walking, I will understand what my abilities are.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeMilitaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is due to appear in court on 20 January.The Federal Road Safety Corps inNigeriasaid they believed the vehicle was travelling “beyond the legally prescribed speed limit”.Kayode was driving the former world heavyweight boxing champion, Joshua, 36, his personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, on 29 December on a busy highway linking Lagos and Ibadan in south-west Nigeria.The Lexus SUV was travelling at high speed when the tyre on the passenger side burst while trying to overtake a vehicle. The Lexus crashed into a stationary lorry carrying soya beans that was illegally parked on the hard shoulder of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, 30 miles from Lagos. Ayodele and Ghami, both 36, died at the scene.The 46-year-old driver is a longstanding member of the boxer’s team, and was granted bail of 5m naira (£2,580), but will remain in custody until he meets bail conditions.‘Stay strong, champion’: boxing world offers condolences to Anthony JoshuaRead moreThe driver and Joshua survived with minor injuries, but Kayode was taken to the Lagoon hospital in Ikoyi and kept under observation for two days. After the crash, Joshua and his mother paid their respects to the boxer’s friends at the funeral home.The accident occurred 10 days after the former world champion celebrated hisvictory against the YouTuber Jake Paul in the US. Prior to the crash, Joshua was believed to be preparing to return to the boxing ring early this year.After the crash, the Ogun state government said in a statement: “Anthony Joshua and another passenger were immediately evacuated to a specialised medical facility in Lagos.“Following comprehensive clinical assessments, doctors have confirmed that both patients are stable and do not require any emergency medical intervention at this time.

He said he believed Washington’s true objective was to seize control of Venezuelan resources including oil, gold and rare-earth metals.“Since they can’t accuse me or accuse Venezuela of having weapons of mass destruction … since they can’t accuse us of having nuclear missiles … or chemical weapons … they have invented a claim that the US knows is as false as the claim about weapons of mass destruction that led them into a forever war,” Maduro said. “I believe that we need to set all this aside and start serious talks.“The US government knows … that if they want to seriously discuss an agreement to combat drug trafficking, we’re ready. If they want oil,Venezuelais ready for US investment, like with Chevron, whenever they want it, wherever they want it and however they want it.”The New York Timesreportedlast month that Maduro had responded to Trump’s pressure campaign by regularly sleeping in different locations and switching mobile phones so as to avoid being captured by US special forces or killed in an aerial attack.Asked what impact Trump’s pressure campaign was having on his physical and emotional state, however, Maduro struck a nonchalant tone. “I have a foolproof bunker: almighty God,” he replied. “I have entrusted Venezuela to our Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Kings.”US struck ‘big facility’ in Venezuela, Trump claimed without offering detailsRead moreMaduro’s pre-recorded interview came after Trump said on Monday that the US had hit a docking facility that served Venezuelan drug trafficking boats last month. US media reports have claimed the CIA was behind the drone strike.If confirmed, the first strike on land would marka new phase in a campaignthat has involved the deployment of a huge US naval fleet,airstrikes on alleged drug traffickersand a“total blockade” of sanctioned oil tankers, theseizure of two vesselsand the pursuit of a third.Maduro said he had not spoken to Trump since a 10-minute conversation on 21 November, which he called cordial and respectful. “That conversation was enjoyable even, but since then the evolution has not been enjoyable,” he said, calling for “dialogue and diplomacy” between Washington and Caracas.The interview was recorded on New Year’s Eve, the same day the US militaryannounced strikes against five alleged drug-smuggling boats. The latest attacks bring the total number of known boat strikes to 35 and the number of people killed to at least 115, according to Trump administration figures. Venezuelans are among the victims.Trump has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US and asserted that Washington is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels. The strikes began off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaNicolás MaduroUS foreign policyTrump administrationDonald TrumpAmericasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Independent, transparent investigations are critical not only to uncovering the truth, but also to maintaining community trust and preventing future deaths.“Without genuine independence, the cycle of harm, mistrust and unanswered questions will continue.”NT police’s acting assistant commissioner, Peter Malley, said the woman’s death was being treated seriously.“Police take any death in custody incredibly seriously and the Crime Command are currently in Tennant Creek investigating, with oversight from both the Professional Standards and Cultural Reform Commands,” he said.Sign up: AU Breaking News email“At this stage, it appears the woman has suffered a medical incident.”A postmortem was due to take place on Friday but the findings are yet to be released.At a media conference the day after the woman’s death, Malley said he had “no issues” with police investigating police when it came to an Aboriginal death.“We investigate our own all the time. We’re very good at it, and people talk about conflicts all the time but we’re legislated to do it and we do it very well,” he said.The Country Liberal party MP Steve Edgington, whose Barkly electorate includes Tennant Creek, said his thoughts were with the woman’s family and loved ones, and the matter was subject to a full and thorough investigation by the police and the coroner.It is understood the woman suffered from rheumatic heart disease, a condition thatdisproportionately affects Indigenous Australians.Unlike police watch houses in Alice Springs, Palmerston and Darwin, the Tennant Creek watch house does not have an on-duty custody nurse, which was a recommendation from the coronial inquiry after the 2012 death of an Aboriginal man in Alice Springs.Custody nurses are able to check detainees’ medical records and conduct health assessments. NT police said an “in depth” health assessment was conducted on the woman by an on-duty officer, and that she was “deemed fit for custody”.In a statement on Friday, NT police said the question of whether an Aboriginal person had any underlying health issues also formed part of the health assessment.“When admitted to Tennant Creek Watchhouse, all individuals undergo a police health assessment. She was deemed fit for custody and officers saw no sign of injuries,” a spokesperson said.“The Tennant Creek Watchhouse does not have a custody nurse position. All those arrested and admitted to the watchhouse in Tennant Creek undergo a police health assessment.“The 44-year-old was found unresponsive during a cell check at 1.03pm [on Saturday 27 December]. CPR was immediately conducted by police until the arrival of an ambulance a short time later. She was pronounced deceased at the Tennant Creek Hospital.”Of 113 deaths in custody recorded in 2024-25, 33 were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people –the highest number of Indigenous deaths in custodyin a 12-month span since 1979.Indigenous Australians can call13YARNon 13 92 76 for information and crisis support; or call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansNorthern TerritoryDeaths in custodynewsShareReuse this content"

Open home attenders’ details may be kept to contact potential homebuyers for marketing, or less often in case of theft.Holt said most businesses she worked with would delete data when it was no longer necessary. Breaches were more likely to be observed among agencies reusing generic privacy policies borrowed from other websites or by franchisees from brands, she said.Larger businesses with more customers would be targeted but the review could also check on small franchisees of big national brands in sectors such as real estate, an OAIC spokesperson said.Some targeted businesses could be caught unawares when they resumed trading after a holiday shutdown, Holt said, since the sweep was announced during the busy mid-December period.The commissioner on Friday said businesses would likely have strengthened their privacy policies in anticipation of the crackdown.Explore more on these topicsPrivacyHousingBusinessnewsShareReuse this content"

Ellen DeGeneres, Robin Wright and Courtney Love moved to England; Rosie O’Donnell opted for Ireland; Eva Longoria, Spain. Other Trump critics, including Richard Gere, Lena Dunham and Ryan Gosling, have upped sticks without citing the re-election as a motivating factor.In the case of Clooney, however, there has appeared little doubt that his decision to gain French citizenship was primarily because of Trump, whose re-election he energetically campaigned against. Yet amid the heat and headlines generated by the pair’s war of words, some of the actor’s reasons for relocating may have flown under the radar.‘He’ll become an ambassador for the Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée’The Clooneys’ 170-hectare (420-acre) Provence estate, capped by an 18th-century chateau, encompasses a swimming pool, ornamental lake, lavender garden, boules pitch and olive grove. It also includes a 20-acre vineyard, planted 25 years ago by agronomist Laurence Berlemont, whose previous clients include Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at Château Miraval, just 30 minutes away. Under Berlemont’s steering, the wines of Miraval have become lucrative and celebrated, with healthy international sales and rosettes from Le Guide Hachette des Vins.View image in fullscreenBrignoles in the Var, France, where the Clooney’s  Domain du Canadel is located.Photograph: Laurent Laurent Vu/Sipa/ShutterstockEven closer to the Clooneys is George Lucas’s Château Margüi – AKA Skywalker Vineyards – a substantial wine and olive oil making enterprise (plus high-end holiday lets). Also nearby is Le Plan-de-la-Tour, the estate formerly owned by Johnny Depp, featuring vineyards, olive groves, and a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed wine cave. The estates of celebrity vintners such as Kylie Minogue, John Malkovich and Jon Bon Jovi are also in the area.Historically, the fruits of the vines at the estate now owned by the Clooneys have been fed into the local cooperative, but the president of the Coteaux Varois appellation syndicate appeared eager for the incomers to “exploit the vineyard”.“In buying in our region,” said Eric Lambert, “[Clooney] will certainly become a new ambassador for the AOC [Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée].” Meanwhile, Berlemont hassaidClooney joined her for blending sessions, and praised his “good palate”. “He’s very humble,” she added, “ready to listen”.There were evenmurmuringsin the wine press that the Clooneys would debut a rosé and a white as early as 2025. That has not come to pass, yet Clooney is no stranger to alcoholic entrepreneurship: in 2017 he sold Casamigos – the tequila brand he co-founded four years earlier – for $1bn (£790m).‘I don’t want my kids to be worried about paparazzi’Both Lucas and Jolie-Pitt’s wines have benefited from high-profile partnerships with the nearby Cannes film festival. Yet Clooney’s association with European film festivals has been predominantly with Cannes’ rival in Venice. At least 10 of his films, including Jay Kelly last August, Wolfs the year before and his own directorial efforts – Suburbicon (2017), The Ides of March (2011) and Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) – have premiered on the Lido; he has only been to Cannes twice.View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney’s Lake Como villa.Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockClooney’s affection for Italy has been long and mutual. In 2002, he bought a villa on Lake Como, and he and his wife,Amal Clooney, the British-Lebanese human rights barrister married in Venice in 2014. A 2012 profile of the actor noted that he was “fast becoming the most popular public figure in Italy … despite [being a man] who isn’t Italian, doesn’t speak Italian, and lives here only in summertime.”So why did the Clooneys not seek Italian citizenship? A clue may lie in the actor’s praise for France’s privacy laws. In an interview withEsquire in October, Clooney said: “I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood. I don’t want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don’t want them being compared to somebody else’s famous kids.”Italian rules over publishing photographs of people in public without their consent have strengthened over the past decade, and are tighter than those in the US. Yet France’s are nonetheless more stringent, and the climate surrounding celebrity less excitable, especially in rural areas. Meanwhile, the secluded location of the Clooneys’ French estate acts a significant deterrent to those hoping for a photo. By contrast, anyone with a rowing boat can in theory gain a commanding view of the villas overlooking Lake Como.‘Significant consequences … including suspension of entry into the US’Others have questioned why Clooney did not apply for British citizenship, given that he and Amal have family there, as well as a house in Windsor since 2014. Amal also has chambers in London and two fellowships at Oxford – not the easiest commute from rural Provence.Yet it is her involvement on a 2024 advisory panel reviewing the international criminal court investigation into potential war crimes in Gaza that offers the strongest indication as to why the couple felt it imperative to relocate their family from Los Angeles.View image in fullscreenThe Clooneys at the Venice premiere of Wolves in 2024.Photograph: Fabio Frustaci/EPAIn April 2024, Clooney and her fellow panellists recommended that the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan issue an arrest warrant for Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuand former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant. In her statement, Clooney said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.A warrant was issued in November 2024, and the following February, Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC and naming Khan in its annexe, promising to “impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC’s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members”.Last April, Amal was among a number of senior legal counsels to the ICCwarnedby the Foreign Office that they could be at risk of sanctions by the Trump administration, including being banned from entering the US.Much has been made of the need for the Clooneys to fast-track their French citizenship application before tougher requirements over language fluency are brought in at the start of 2026 (George’s French reportedly remains rusty). Yet the prospect of the whole family being unable to re-enter the US also seems likely to have hastened their exit.Explore more on these topicsFilmGeorge ClooneyAmal ClooneyEuropeUS politicsDonald TrumpCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Pilloud said the investigation would examine the bar’s compliance with safety regulations.As efforts to identify the victims continued, Pilloud said investigators would focus on the materials used in the renovation of the bar and its basement, its operating licence, the availability of fire extinguishers and emergency exits, as well as the number of people in the venue when the fire began.One image circulating online on Friday appeared to show the ceiling of the basement where the new year’s party was being held, apparently clad with foam soundproofing panels, catching fire as the sparklers were held aloft.Mathias Reynard, the president of the Valais regional government, said authorities were working as fast as possible to identify the victims, many of whom had been severely burned, a process that officials said earlier could take several days.Reynard said experts were using dental records, DNA samples and clothing descriptions in the “terrible and sensitive” task of identifying the badly burned bodies. “Nothing can be told to the families unless we are 100% sure,” he said.Emanuele Galeppini, a 16-year-old international golfer from Italy who lived in Dubai, was named on Friday as the first of several possible Italian victims of the disaster to be identified.In a post on its website, the Italian Golf Federation paid tribute to Emanuele Galeppini as a ‘young athlete who embodied passion and authentic values’.Photograph: Italian Golf FederationPope Leo expressed his “compassion and solicitude” and said he was praying that “the Lord will welcome the deceased into His abode of peace and light, and sustain the courage of those who suffer in their hearts or in their bodies”.The Valais police chief, Frédéric Gisler, said 119 people had been injured, 113 of whom had been identified. Among the injured are 71 Swiss, 14 French, 11 Italians, four Serbs, and one person each from Bosnia, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland and Portugal.Eric Bonvin, the director of the regional hospital in Sion, told the press conference that the type of injuries received by most of the wounded “will need to be treated for a very long time”.The EU said it had contacted Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said some of the injured were being cared for in French hospitals. Others were being treated in Germany and Poland.Gisler said the death toll still stood at 40, with formal identification continuing. A ceremony will be held on 9 January in Crans-Montana to give the shellshocked, close-knit community in the mountain resort a chance to remember the victims.Stéphane Ganzer, a regional health and safety official, told RTL radio earlier on Friday that “a large number” of the injured were in a critical condition. “When 15% or more of an adult’s body has third-degree burns, there is a risk of death,” he said.Ganzer told the press conference the families of the victims would receive psychological support from the police, describing the tragedy as “unprecedented in the history of our canton”. About 40 police officers were still on the scene, he said.Pilloud said no criminal liability had yet been established, adding that it was “essential that we do not make any assumptions”. It was not clear when the last fire checks at the bar were carried out, but no irregularities were reported.The prosecutor said the owners of the bar had been questioned, but not under caution. If there were grounds to suspect their liability, “an investigation will be opened for negligent arson, negligent homicide, and negligent bodily injury”.French media, citing property records, have saidthe bar is owned by two French nationals, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who bought it in 2015 and also owned two other establishments in the area including a hamburger restaurant in the town.A friend of the couple, who are originally from Corsica and arrived in the area in the early 2000s, said Jessica Moretti, who was in the bar when the fire broke out, had been burned on the arm. Both have since been unreachable.Several witness accounts reported by the Swiss, French and Italian media said restaurant staff had held sparklers mounted on champagne bottles high as part of a regular show for patrons, who made special orders to their tables.There were “waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers”, one witness, Axel, told the Italian media outlet Local Team. “They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire.”View image in fullscreenAn image that has been circulating online that appears to show the moment just before the ceiling caught fire. The image may have been subjected to some digital enhancement.A Swiss fire expert, Markus Knorr,told the Swiss outlet 20 Minutesthat the type of soundproofing panels apparently used “burn fast and burst into flames” unless fireproofed, and fire could “spread extremely fast since they are mounted horizontally”.Concerns have also been raised about the number of exits from the bar’s basement, which was used for special events and reportedly accessible from the ground floor only by a single staircase that several survivors described as narrow.

We’ve never experienced anything like this.”graphic of resortArlino Marchese and his friend Sacha Dimic, from the nearby town of Sierre, were in Crans-Montana to ski on Friday. “We used to go to Le Constellation a lot when we were younger,” said Dimic. “It was a good bar, with a good atmosphere and really popular. All those lives gone, it’s terrible.”Piermarco Pani, an 18-year-old who, like many others in the town, knew the bar well, said: “They were people like us.” Dozens of people left flowers or lit candles on a makeshift altar at the top of the road leading to the bar, which police had cordoned off.Elisa Sousa, 17, told Reuters she was meant to have been at Le Constellation on Thursday night but had spent the evening at a family gathering instead. “I’ll need to thank my mother a hundred times for not letting me go,” she said at the vigil.The Swiss president, Guy Parmelin, who visited the mountain resort on Thursday, said the country would hold five days of mourning to mark what he described as one of the most traumatic events in its history.The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said on X: “Our thoughts are with all the victims and their families. The FCDO stand ready to support any British nationals affected.”Explore more on these topicsCrans-Montana fireSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

This isn’t leadership. It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire,” the foreign ministry said in apost on X.Mamdani revoked an Adams-era order that adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which the previous administration said included “demonizingIsraeland holding it to double standards as forms of contemporary antisemitism”.Asked about the criticism by a reporter from the Forward, a Jewish newspaper that has chronicled the experiences of Jews in the United States since 1897,Mamdani acknowledged the concernsof a number of Jewish organizations about dropping that definition, but pledged that “protecting Jewish New Yorkers is going to be a focus of my administration”.“My administration will also be marked by a city government that will be relentless in its efforts to combat hate and division, and we will showcase that by fighting hate across the city, and that includes fighting the scourge of antisemitism, by actually funding hate crime prevention, by celebrating our neighbors, and by practicing a politics of universality,” the new mayor said.In a statement, theNew Yorkchapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair-NY) said it welcomed the revocation of the “controversial and overly broad” IHRA definition of “antisemitism” that it said is “often used to censor criticism of the Israeli government’s racism and crimes against humanity”.I drafted the definition of antisemitism. Rightwing Jews are weaponizing it | Kenneth SternRead more“Mayor Adams’ order would have enshrined the controversial IHRA definition of antisemitism even though its author has said it was never meant for government use and though the overly-broad definition declares any recognition of the Israeli government’s racism or disagreement with Zionism as antisemitic,” the statement read. “The order would have also unconstitutionally limited boycotts against only Israel.”The council called Adams’s order an “unconstitutional, Israel First attack on free speech [that] should have never been issued in the first place. We applaud Mayor Mamdani for immediately overturning it.”Israel’s response came hours after Mamdani issued an order to rescind all executive orders that Adams issued after he was indicted on federal corruption charges in 2024 – charges that were later, controversially, dropped.Mamdani’s office said the decision was to ensure “a fresh start for the incoming administration”.One of Adams’s orders, now revoked,includedprohibiting city officials overseeing the city pension system from making decisions in line with the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, which Mamdani has said he supports.Asecond orderdirected the New York police commissioner, currently Jessica Tisch, to evaluate proposals for regulating protest activity occurring close to houses of worship. It came after demonstrations outside an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event promoting immigration to Israel sparked claims of antisemitism.“New York City has always been this nation’s melting pot, but too often, over the last few years, we’ve seen those of Jewish ancestry be singled out and targeted,” Adams said last month, adding that the measures were aimed to “protect New Yorkers’ tax dollars and protect their right to practice their religion without harassment”.The measures were seen as an effort to curb Mamdani, who has vowed to govern as a democratic socialist, and whose past comments about Israel, including a vow to divest New York from Israeli government bonds, have sparked some opposition.But in his address on Thursday, Mamdani was careful to reassure Jewish New Yorkers, saying: “Where else could a Muslim kid like me grow up eating bagels and lox?”Mamdani pledges ‘new era’ for New York and vows to govern ‘audaciously’Read moreHe was sworn in on the Qur’an by a Jewish New Yorker, Vermont senatorBernie Sanders. Also in attendance were Jewish religious leaders who had not endorsed Mamdani during his campaign.“I know there are some who view this administration with distrust or disdain, or who see politics as permanently broken,” Mamdani said. “And while only action can change minds, I promise you this: if you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor. Regardless of whether we agree, I will protect you, celebrate with you, mourn alongside you, and never, not for a second, hide from you.”After issuing his first set of executive orders, Mamdani said he would keep open the recently created office to combat antisemitism. “That is an issue that we take very seriously,” he told reporters.William Daroff, the CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish organizations, called Mamdani’s rescinding of Adams’s order on the definition of antisemitism “a troubling indicator of the direction in which he is leading the city, just one day at the helm”.Daroff told theliberal-leaning Forwardthat the move “diminishes New York City’s ability to recognize and respond to antisemitism at a time when incidents continue to rise”.Explore more on these topicsZohran MamdaniIsraelAntisemitismMiddle East and north AfricaNew YorknewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “We are locked and loaded, and ready to go,” without explaining what that might mean in practice.Protests in Iran are in their sixth day, and are the largestsince 2022, when the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini triggered demonstrations across the country. The current unrest was triggered by an unprecedented decline in the value of the national currency on Sunday. The Iranian rial dropped to about 1.4m to the US dollar, further harming an already beleaguered economy.Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, called Trump’s statement “reckless and dangerous”, and said the country’s military was on standby. He also said the protests had been mostly peaceful, but that attacks on public property would not be tolerated.“Given President Trump’s deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated,” he said.At least seven people have been killed, and videos have shown security forces carrying shotguns withthe sound of shooting in the background.‘We want the mullahs gone’: economic crisis sparks biggest protests in Iran since 2022Read moreIn response to Trump’s threat of intervention, Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to the supreme leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned that Iran’s national security was a “red line, not material for adventurist tweets”.“Any intervening hand nearing Iran security on pretexts will be cut off with a regret-inducing response,” Shamkhani said in a post on X.The threats come just days after Trump said thatthe US could strike Iran if it was found to be rebuilding its nuclear programme,further escalating tensions between the two countries.Another senior Iranian official, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, accused the US and Israel of having a hand in the demonstrations in Iran, a common refrain by officials in response to protests.“Trump must realize that US intervention in this domestic matter will lead to destabilisation of the whole region and the destruction of American interests,” Larijani wrote on X. “The American people must know that Trump is the one that started this adventure, and they should pay attention to the safety of their soldiers.”Iran has threatened to target American soldiers stationed in the Middle East in the past, and in June it attacked Al-Udeid airbase in Qatar after the US struck Iranian nuclear enrichment sites.The current protests have taken place in Tehran but have also spread to other cities, such as Isfahan in central Iran. Shopkeepers have closed their stores in protest and students have taken over campuses to express their grievances. Though economic conditions are the central grievance, demonstrators have also chanted anti-government slogans and decried what they said was corruption and mismanagement by the government.Protests continued on Friday, with marches taking place to commemorate the burial of several demonstrators who had been killed. Videos appeared to show mourners stopping security forces from attending the funeral of 21-year-old Amirhessam Khodayari, who was killed on Wednesday in Lorestan province.Khodayari was originally reported as a member of the Basij, a volunteer paramilitary group, but his father denied the claims on video.The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian,initially invited protest leaders for talks, taking a less confrontational approach than authorities did in the 2022 protests, which they violently suppressed. Pezeshkian said that he had instructed the government to listen to the protesters “legitimate demands”.The recent deaths of demonstrators, however, could signal that authorities are taking a harder line against protests as they continue. A statement from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps on Monday warned that it would take a harsh line against any foreign interference or “sedition” in the country.As Iranian authorities grapple with protests at home, it has tried to stave off accusations from the US that it is reconstituting its nuclear programme. Iran has said that it is no longer enriching uranium anywhere in the country and has signalled it is open for negotiations with the west.Explore more on these topicsIranProtestMiddle East and north AfricaAyatollah Ali KhameneiDonald TrumpUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

At the time,76% of people backed the move.Fast-forward to November 2025, and an equivalent poll foundtwo-thirds of people thought Begum should not be allowed back to the UK.In policy terms, therefore, responding tothe European court of human rights’ intervention in the mattershould be a no-brainer for the Home Office. This week, media briefings suggested Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, would “robustly” push back against the court after it questioned whether the UK should have considered if Begum – who left the country aged 15 – had been trafficked before it left her stateless in a Syrian camp.It is not, however, a subject that ministers can simply ignore, for two reasons in particular.The first is that Begum is not alone. In November,a report into counter-terrorismby a commission of senior UK lawyers said the government’s refusal to repatriate most of the several dozen Britons still living in camps for former IS members and their families was becoming “untenable”.It said that between 55 and 72 people with links to the UK remain in the camps, among them about 30 to 40 children, living in “inhuman” and often dangerous conditions, and added that other countries have already taken action on the issue.Who is Shamima Begum and what are her prospects of returning to UK?Read moreThe second reason – for all that Mahmood might dismiss it – is that the human rights court might have a point.Even if one was to argue that the 15-year-old Begum was old enough to understand the implications of seeking out a self-styled global caliphate that has carried outnumerous and atrocious rights abuses, the UK has never sought to hold her to account.Nor has it sought to take responsibility for the actions of someone who, when she left the UK, was entirely a product of her home country.Begum’s case also highlights another political quandary, which is not currently high on the list of voters’ concerns, but has potentially huge repercussions: what does it mean for the rights of Britons who have migrant heritage?Ministers were able to strip Begum of her UK citizenship only because they said she was entitled to Bangladeshi nationality through her parents.Bangladesh, however, has rejected this. Citizenship cannot be revoked if it leaves someone stateless, meaning Begum’s fate would have been impossible for an equivalent Briton without an overseas background.The bar for losing UK nationality is set high. It can only happen if citizenship was acquired fraudulently, or if removing it is “conducive to the public good”.Home Office guidancespecifies this as meaning the affected person is connected to serious organised crime, terrorism or war crimes.It is for these reasons that the Home Office concludedit could not revoke the citizenship of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, the British-Egyptian activist who was granted the status while in prison in Egypt in 2021, owing to his mother’s birth in the UK. He came to Britain on Boxing Day, despite the emergence of social media posts including one in which he talked about the need to kill “colonialists” and “Zionists”.Nonetheless, both the Conservatives and Reform UK have argued for Abd el-Fattah to be deported and to lose his UK citizenship, indicating that a future government might use the sanction more widely against dual nationals, or those from migrant backgrounds, even if they have not necessarily broken the law.What did Alaa Abd el-Fattah say in past social media posts and why is there a backlash?Read moreThe dispute ties into wider arguments about migration – an area where Keir Starmer’s government has faced accusations of trying too hard to placate voters tempted by Reform, at the cost of losing potential voters on the other side of the political divide to the Liberal Democrats and Greens.Robert Ford, a professor of political science at Manchester University, said it was possible for ministers to make a wider argument about the importance of citizenship as a right, should they want to tackle the issue head on.“If the government wanted to reverse the Shamima Begum case, they should do so on the grounds that if [British] citizenship is not a safe status for her; it’s not a safe status for anyone,” he said. “Would you like it if Nigel Farage revoked your citizenship because Israel grants your citizenship, or because you have Irish grandparents?“Citizenship is an unrestricted, unrevokable, irreversible right and status, or it is nothing, that is how you would argue for it.”However, Ford added that, while this was a plausible general argument to make, the example of Begum was unlikely to be the best way to advance it.“I say this as someone who thinks the government has erred a great deal by not adopting principled positions and [by] chasing the polling too much, but even with that in mind, the Shamima Begum case is a difficult one,” he said.“It will never be a popular thing to do because, although one can frame the issue as one of trafficking, this is somebody leaving the country to go and join IS, which is never going to be a popular cause.”Explore more on these topicsShamima BegumHuman rightsEuropean court of human rightsBritish identity and societyIslamic StateUK security and counter-terrorismCounter-terrorism policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Their complaints went unheeded, despite the city’s much-lauded ranking for waste segregation and other cleanliness measures.“I have received information about 10 deaths due to a diarrhoea outbreak caused by contaminated water in the Bhagirathpura area,” said Indore’s mayor, Pushyamitra Bhargava. Sewage was mixing “in the main line leading from the water tank”, he added.Local media reported that the death toll had climbed to 15, but there was no official confirmation. At least 32 patients remain in intensive care units. Beyond those hospitalised, the state’s chief minister, Mohan Yadav, said health teams conducting door-to-door visits identified 2,456 “suspected patients”, who were given first aid “on the spot”.Authorities say a public toilet constructed above a drinking water pipeline appears to have allowed sewage to seep into the supply. The toilet was built without a septic tank.Residents began streaming into hospitals earlier this week, complaining of vomiting, diarrhoea and high fever.Water tests “confirmed the presence of abnormal bacteria generally found in sewer water comprising human waste”, a medical official said.Residents said their complaints about the water had run into a bureaucratic maze of red tape.“Prima facie, this case falls under gross dereliction of duty,” said an Indore municipal councillor, Kamal Waghela. Several municipal officials have been suspended pending an investigation.The five-month-old infant who died had been bottle-fed using tap water, his father, Sunil Sahu, told reporters. “No one told us the water was contaminated. We filtered it. The same water was flowing throughout the neighbourhood. There was no warning,” he said.An editorial in the Hindu called for “better enforcement of water guidelines and other environmental laws at all levels”. The newspaper noted that toxic air pollution, which blankets many cities, was already “wreaking havoc on citizens’ health” and said what happened in Madhya Pradesh should serve as “a wake-up call for India’s water management”.The opposition Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi, accused the Bharatiya Janata party-led state government of negligence, saying “clean water isn’t a favour – it’s a right to life”.The government said new rules would be framed to prevent similar incidents. “No stone will be left unturned to make sure it does not happen again,” Yadav said.The Indore crisis comes amid broader concerns over water safety nationwide. The Times of India reported that only 8% of public water-testing laboratories run by the Delhi government were accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, which certifies facilities meeting international quality-control standards. Nationwide, 59% of public labs are now accredited.Experts warn that as India’s urban population grows rapidly, lapses in water testing heighten the risk of disease outbreaks.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsiaAccess to waternewsShareReuse this content"

You could see the helicopter so close to the house it was incredible.“The sea could have been very dangerous, the water is very bitter and if they are in that water they do not have long. It is a dangerous place to be.“It was freezing, and when the sea is as harsh as it is, every care needs to be taken, you need to be at your wisest,” he said.HM Coastguard said that the search was continuing.The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has issued advice warning that the effects of cold water shock, combined with weather conditions, pose a risk to anyone entering water that is 15C or below, particularly at a time of year when the average sea temperature around the UK and Ireland is 6C to 10C.Gareth Morrison, the head of water safety for the RNLI, said: “We know this time of year many people take part in festive and new year dips, or continue to take part in regular winter swims. We are urging anyone entering the water to be aware of the dangers, check sea conditions carefully and to understand their own limitations.“With the sea temperatures still dropping and reaching their coldest around March, the effects of cold water, combined with weather conditions and any personal health issues, should be taken seriously before venturing in.”The operation in Yorkshire comes after a 51-year-old man died in the sea at Brighton on New Year’s Day.Sussex police were alerted at 10.35am on Thursday after the swimmer, from Kettering, Northamptonshire,was recovered from the water to the west of Brighton Palace Pier.Explore more on these topicsYorkshirenewsShareReuse this content"

Five representatives of West Midlands police were also present.According to the document, the force told the group it had “significant intelligence indicating potential for disorder” involvingMaccabi Tel Avivfans “based on recent fixtures”, citing incidents in Italy, Norway and Amsterdam.“Other sports, eg baseball in Holland, have also seen disorder when Israeli teams were involved,” police said according to the minutes.“These incidents suggest that Maccabi Tel Aviv’s presence could attract protest and disorder, even outside the football context.”Police also said that there was a “high likelihood of protest activity linked to the fixture whether aimed at MTA [Maccabi Tel Aviv] supporters or MTA themselves. This sits at the highest threat,” according to the document.However, the force also acknowledged the risk level of the match remained at “medium” without away fans due to community tensions and the potential for spontaneous protest.The decision to introduce the ban, which was not objected to by any members of the group, was made on the rationale that there was a “high risk associated with the presence of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans” and that “community tensions could be exacerbated”.The head of West Midlands police has been recalled to parliament next Tuesday by the Home Affairs Committee, which is scrutinising the decision to ban away fans.Ahead of the hearing,further details have been providedby chief constable Craig Guildford from West Midlands police about the intelligence that led to the ban – including notes of an email summarising a meeting between the head of WMP’s football unit and Dutch police.The email notes “violent confrontations” that took place before a match between Ajax and Maccabi Aviv in Amsterdam in 2024, including alleged incidents of Muslim taxi drivers being pulled from vehicles and the singing of anti-Muslim and anti-Gaza chants.On the day of the fixture, there was a ”national mobilisation of Muslim youths” travelling to Amsterdam “to seek retribution” – the notes state – with reported hit-and-run incidents on Maccabi fans.The government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, Lord Mann, had previously described a number of the claims made by West Midlands police as “inaccurate” and said the force had “conflated different things”.The Times reported thatDutch police were “surprised” by claimsattributed to them by the WMP force.The leader of Birmingham city council, John Cotton, and other council bosses are due to be quizzed by MPs next week.In a letter to the chair of the Home Affairs Committee in December, Birmingham city council’s executive director of city operations said there would be an independent review to “ascertain what can be improved from a governance perspective”.West Midlands police were approached but declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsAntisemitismMaccabi Tel AvivBirminghamAston VillaFreedom of informationnewsShareReuse this content"

Experts said this was the exact opposite of what should be recommended, and may increase the risk of patients dying from the disease.In another “alarming” example, the company provided bogus information about crucial liver function tests, which could leave people with serious liver disease wrongly thinking they are healthy.Third of UK citizens have used AI for emotional support, research revealsRead moreGoogle searches for answers about women’s cancer tests also provided “completely wrong” information, which experts said could result in people dismissing genuine symptoms.A Google spokesperson said that many of the health examples shared with them were “incomplete screenshots”, but from what they could assess they linked “to well-known, reputable sources and recommend seeking out expert advice”.The Guardian investigation comes amid growing concern that AI data can confuse consumers who may assume that it is reliable. In November last year, a study found AI chatbots across a range of platformsgave inaccurate financial advice, while similar concerns have been raised aboutsummaries of news stories.Sophie Randall, director of the Patient Information Forum, which promotes evidence-based health information to patients, the public and healthcare professionals, said the examples showed “Google’s AI Overviews can put inaccurate health information at the top of online searches, presenting a risk to people’s health”.Stephanie Parker, the director of digital at Marie Curie, an end-of-life charity, said: “People turn to the internet in moments of worry and crisis. If the information they receive is inaccurate or out of context, it can seriously harm their health.”The Guardian uncovered several cases of inaccurate health information in Google’s AI Overviews after a number of health groups, charities and professionals raised concerns.Anna Jewell, the director of support, research and influencing at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said advising patients to avoid high-fat foods was “completely incorrect”. Doing so “could be really dangerous and jeopardise a person’s chances of being well enough to have treatment”, she added.Jewell said: “The Google AI response suggests that people with pancreatic cancer avoid high-fat foods and provides a list of examples. However, if someone followed what the search result told them then they might not take in enough calories, struggle to put on weight, and be unable to tolerate either chemotherapy or potentially life-saving surgery.”Typing “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” also served up misleading information, with masses of numbers, little context and no accounting for nationality, sex, ethnicity or age of patients.Pamela Healy, the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said the AI summaries were alarming. “Many people with liver disease show no symptoms until the late stages, which is why it’s so important that they get tested. But what the Google AI Overviews say is ‘normal’ can vary drastically from what is actually considered normal.“It’s dangerous because it means some people with serious liver disease may think they have a normal result then not bother to attend a follow-up healthcare meeting.”A search for “vaginal cancer symptoms and tests” listed a pap test as a test for vaginal cancer, which is incorrect.Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said: “It isn’t a test to detect cancer, and certainly isn’t a test to detect vaginal cancer – this is completely wrong information. Getting wrong information like this could potentially lead to someone not getting vaginal cancer symptoms checked because they had a clear result at a recent cervical screening.“We were also worried by the fact that the AI summary changed when we did the exact same search, coming up with a different response each time that pulled from different sources. That means that people are getting a different answer depending on when they search, and that’s not good enough.”Lamnisos said she was extremely concerned. “Some of the results we’ve seen are really worrying and can potentially put women in danger,” she said.The Guardian also found Google AI Overviews delivered misleading results for searches about mental health conditions. “This is a huge concern for us as a charity,” said Stephen Buckley, the head of information at Mind.Some of the AI summaries for conditions such as psychosis and eating disorders offered “very dangerous advice” and were “incorrect, harmful or could lead people to avoid seeking help”, Buckley said.Some also missed out important context or nuance, he added. “They may suggest accessing information from sites that are inappropriate … and we know that when AI summarises information, it can often reflect existing biases, stereotypes or stigmatising narratives.”Google said the vast majority of its AI Overviews were factual and helpful, and it continuously made quality improvements. The accuracy rate of AI Overviews was on a par with its other search features like featured snippets, which had existed for more than a decade, it added.The company also said that when AI Overviews misinterpreted web content or missed context, it would take action as appropriate under its policies.A Google spokesperson said: “We invest significantly in the quality of AI Overviews, particularly for topics like health, and the vast majority provide accurate information.”Explore more on these topicsGoogleAI (artificial intelligence)HealthCharitiesAlphabetComputingVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Sadly, he was pronounced dead at the scene. His next of kin have been informed. The coroner has been informed, and the death is not being treated as suspicious.”The death comes after the disappearance of Matthew Upham, 63, and another man during a Christmas Day swim in the Devon seaside townof Budleigh Salterton. Upham and the other man, aged in his 40s, reportedly went missing after entering the water to help a woman in difficulty.A number of people were rescued from the stormy waters at Budleigh Salterton and checked by paramedics or taken to hospital as a precaution, but the two men were not found, Devon and Cornwall police said.The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has issued advice that the effects of cold water shock, combined with weather conditions, pose a risk to anyone entering water that is 15C or below, especially at a time of year when the average sea temperature around the UK and Ireland is 6C to 10C.Gareth Morrison, the head of water safety for the RNLI, said: “We know this time of year many people take part in festive and new year dips, or continue to take part in regular winter swims.

Electric carmakers have been forced to cut prices aggressively, and governments around the world have rolled back targets on the shift away from petrol.Tesla’s sales appear to have suffered in large part because of the withdrawal of electric vehicle (EV) subsidies by Donald Trump. The US president has also removed emissions regulations that incentivised electric car production. And Tesla also faced a backlash from some consumers afterMusk’s embrace of far-right politicsat the end of 2024.View image in fullscreenTesla’s sales last year were down by 9% compared with 2024.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APTesla’s deliveries slumped to 418,200 in the final quarter of the year, below the average forecasts of analysts. Sales for 2025 were down by 9% compared with 2024.An average compiled by Bloomberg had suggested that Tesla would deliver 441,000 vehicles during the quarter, but Tesla took the unusual step before the new year ofpublishing its own consensus estimate for the first time, apparently in an effort to guide investors that sales were expected to be lower.Tesla’s share price was down 1% on Friday, although they were down by 8% since Christmas Eve.Trump’s anti-EV policies came despite Musk donating more money than anyone else to the victorious 2024 presidential election campaign and briefly running an effort to cut government costs. Musk at first seemed to win support for EVs from Trump – and even an awkward photoshoot in a Tesla in front of the White House – but theyfell out dramatically in the summer.It was the second consecutive decline in annual sales for Tesla. Yet even as sales have fallen it remains by far the world’s most valuable carmaker, with shares valued at $1.4tn – more than the next 30 carmakers combined. Investors appear to be betting that Musk will lead Tesla to be a leading force in robotics and artificial intelligence.Musk has consistently claimed that autonomous capabilities will set Tesla apart from rivals, and it has started operating alimited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. However, it will still face competition on that front. Several Chinese carmakers and tech companies already have comparable technology, including an offering from BYD called “God’s Eye” that is now included even on its cheapest cars.BYD’s electric car sales rose by 28% during the year despite a weaker performance in December.BYD was founded in 1995 as a battery company byWang Chuanfu, who is often described as China’s equivalent to Musk. Its business already produced more cars overall than Tesla when counting hybrids.The Shenzhen-headquartered manufacturer hasovertaken Tesla during single quarters before. However, its battery electric production pulled away from its US rival in 2025, even as it faced intense competition from Chinese rivals.BYD recorded 4.55m car sales overall during 2025, although its sales of plug-in hybrids fell by 8% year on year to 2.29m. That came despite an uptick in sales of plug-in hybrids, combining a smaller battery with a petrol or diesel engine, in some markets from consumers worried about their ability to charge. BYD also more than doubled its sales of commercial vehicles, including electric buses and lorries, to 57,000.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryTeslaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsnewsShareReuse this content"

Spencer reportedly ordered medication online to end her pregnancy, then buried the remains of her pregnancy in her backyard.It is not clear how far along Spencer’s pregnancy was at the time of her alleged abortion, although police described the fetus as “developed”, the Lexington Herald Leaderreported.Spencer was booked into a jail in Beattyville,Kentucky, on Thursday, jail records show. She remained at the jail as of Friday evening.Abortion may no longer be a top priority for Democratic voters ahead of 2026 midterms, polls showRead moreKentuckybansdoctors from performing abortions any time after conception. However,like the vast majority of states, Kentucky does not outlaw people from inducing – or “self-managing” – their own abortions. Medical experts also widely agree that it is safe to self-manage an abortion using pills in the first trimester of pregnancy.Ordering abortion pills online has become increasingly common since the US supreme court overturnedRoe v Wadeand unleashed awaveof state-level abortion bans in 2022. By the end of 2024, one in four abortions involvedproviders who consulted with patients onlineand thenmailed themabortion pills. Tens of thousands of these abortions took place in states with abortion bans, according todatafrom the research group #WeCount.Still, women have repeatedlyfaced criminal consequencesfor their pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriages. In the two years after Roe fell, 412 people were prosecuted for pregnancy-related crimes, researchers at the reproductive justice group Pregnancy Justicefound.Sixteen of those prosecutions involved homicide charges, while seven involved what researchers called “conduct concerning improper conduct with regard to birth or death”. It is not clear how many cases may have been sparked by authorities’ suspicions that the defendant obtained an abortion, since just nine cases included charges related to undergoing, attempting or researching an abortion.Abortion rights advocates see efforts to criminalize pregnancy outcomes as part of an overarching campaign to establish “fetal personhood”, a legal doctrine that endows embryos and fetuses with full legal rights and protections – including to the point that a fetus’s rights can compete with those of the woman carrying it.Court allows White House to end Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood in 22 statesRead more“The idea that the fetus can be a person and a victim of a crime is being wielded in significant ways when there’s a pregnancy loss,” Wendy Bach, a University of Tennessee law professor,toldthe Guardian in 2024. “So rather than meeting a pregnancy loss with care, with support, with an acknowledgement for the often tragic life circumstances that that involves – we are meeting it with criminal suspicion, with criminal investigation and with prosecution.”Police in Georgiaarrested one womanafter she was found bleeding and unconscious after a miscarriage.Another woman, in Ohio, was arrested after she miscarried into a toilet. Both cases were ultimately dropped.Kentucky police reportedly got involved in Spencer’s case after Spencer talked about her pregnancy to clinic staffers. It is often healthcare workers who tip off the police in cases in which people are criminalized for pregnancy outcomes: out of 412 such cases uncovered by Pregnancy Justice, 264 involved information that had been disclosed in a medical setting.An individual who answered the phone at the Kentucky state police headquarters said that, due to the recent holidays, no one was available to comment on Spencer’s case. A jail official said Spencer had been advised by her attorney not to speak to the media or law enforcement. Spencer’s attorney was not immediately available to speak.Explore more on these topicsKentuckyAbortionReproductive rightsWomen's healthRoe v WadeWomenHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

It will not include their address.The database can include information about offenders for up to 20 years after their last conviction, although it is not retroactive. People will only be eligible for the database if they plead guilty to or are convicted of offenses after 1 January.In January 2022, after Puckett failed to appear for work as a sheriff’s deputy in Robertson county in northern Tennessee,a co-worker went to her homeand found it in flames. Firefighters later discovered Puckett’s body, which had been shot multiple times. James Jackson Conn, Puckett’s ex-boyfriend,pleaded guilty to a chargeof first-degree murder. He is now serving a life sentence.By the time of Puckett’s death, Conn had amassed an extensive record of domestic violence allegations,according to the Tennesseean. In 2019, Conn shoved his then girlfriend down the stairs, dragged her across a yard and hit her in the head, according to a police report. That same year, Conn pushed a woman to the ground when she tried to exit his car. After police ordered Conn not to contact the woman, he called her multiple times and, in December 2019, forced his way into her home.Conn pleaded guilty to multiple domestic violence and trespassing charges, the Tennesseean reported.“I was just horrified when I finally saw all those records, because I know Savanna well enough that she would have never dated him,” Puckett’s mother, Kim Dodson,told a local news outlet in Tennessee. “I honestly, honestly, honestly feel that if she had known that she could still be here.”Dodson started lobbying for the registry after her daughter’s death. Puckett was 22 when she died.One in four adult women and one in seven adult men in the US have been the victim of severe domestic violence,according to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Domestic violence also plays a role in mass shootings.One study foundthat, between 2014 and 2019, almost 70% of all shootings that left four or more people dead involved a perpetrator who killed a partner or family member, or had a history of domestic violence.Explore more on these topicsTennesseeDomestic violencenewsShareReuse this content"

Rescue crews arrived on foot but a helicopter airlift was inhibited due to “severe winds”. An air medic was eventually lowered down and confirmed Casanova was deceased, the department said.Two other hikers were also found dead, but have yet to be identified, and Casanova’s cause of death has not been determined by the county coroner.Three hikers found dead on southern California’s Mount BaldyRead moreMount Baldy, which rises more than 10,000ft and sits just east of Los Angeles, is a popular hiking spot that isalso known for treacherous conditions, particularly in the winter.Casanova was a student at Santa Clara University in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a statement his family made to KABC, and is described by his loved ones as “an avid sailor and outdoorsman”.“We are destroyed by the loss of our beloved Marcus. He was a graduate of Los Alamitos High, a freshman at Santa Clara University’s business school, and an avid sailor and outdoorsman … It is difficult to explain the pain and anguish we are going through and ask for privacy as we try to find our way,” the statement continues.Beginning on Thursday, the US Forest Service announced that seven trails on Mount Baldy, including the Devil’s Backbone,will be closeduntil next Wednesday for the safety of the public.The deaths occurred near where the actor Julian Sands died three years ago. Sands, who starred in A Room With a View and Leaving Las Vegas, was reported missing after setting off on a solo hike in January 2023. His body was found five months later.And in January 2023, the same month Sands went missing, another 15 hikers either got lost, were injured or died on the mountain.The same day Casanova and other hikers were found, the San Bernardino sheriff’s department announced that it had rescued two other hikers – two men, ages 18 and 31 – from another trail on Mount Baldy. One of the hikers was hurt after falling more than 100ft from the trail.In October, three people were also rescued near the same trail where the deceased hikers were found.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaLos AngelesMountaineeringMountainsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Neither device exploded and Capitol police safely disabled both, though the hunt for the perpetrator had been elusive since.The charges – transportation of explosive devices across state lines with intent to harm and malicious attempted destruction using explosives – carry heavy penalties, with the latter carrying a potential 20-year prison sentence.US Capitol pipe bomb suspect says he believed Trump’s 2020 election lieRead moreCole’s defense attorneys argued that their client is on the autism spectrum and had “zero criminal history” and “zero evidence he will flee” in arecent court filing.Authorities arrested Cole on 4 December, nearly five years after the attempted destruction. During searches of his Woodbridge home, police reportedly discovered several bomb-making components in a bedroom closet, including metal pipes, end caps and wire matching materials used in the 2021 devices.According to court filings, Cole’s mobile phone interacted with five cell towers near both party headquarters during the timeframe when the devices were placed. A license plate reader also captured his vehicle leaving Interstate 395 in the area at about 7.10pm that evening.Financial records allegedly showed Cole purchased nearly all the components used to construct the bombs from northern Virginia retail locations throughout 2019 and 2020. Prosecutors noted he continued buying similar materials into August 2022, after the attempted attack.In a video interviewfollowing his arrest, Cole initially denied involvement before admitting he was the individual captured in surveillance footage, according to justice department documents. After agents reminded him that lying constituted an additional offence and asked again if he was the person in the video, Cole “paused for approximately 15 seconds, placed his head face down on the table, and answered, ‘yes’”, court papers state.Cole reportedly told investigators he travelled to Washington to protest the 2020 election outcome and wanted to act against the parties because “they were in charge”. When asked why he targeted both party headquarters, he said: “I really don’t like either party at this point.”Explore more on these topicsUS Capitol attackWashington DCDemocratsRepublicansUS politicsUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

Written across the photo was “America after 100 million deportations,” along with a separate caption that said: “The peace of a nation no longer besieged by the third world.”In response to the post, Hiroshi Nagai, a 78-year-old Japanese graphic designer known for his city pop and dreamscape artwork,saidon X: “This image is being used without permission from the US department of homeland security. What should I do about this?”ICE plans $100m yearlong ‘wartime recruitment’ media blitz to attract new agentsRead moreNagai is widely known for artwork inspired by 1950s Americana, often depicting lush palm trees, serene ocean scenes and dusky cityscapes. His pieces are typically devoid of people, instead presenting distant and contemplative views of urban landscapes.In a statement to the Guardian, a DHS spokesperson said: “DHS will continue using every tool at its disposal to keep the American people informed as our agents work to Make America Safe Again.”The use of Nagai’s work is the latest in a series of incidents in which the department has used various artists’ works to promote its immigration agenda, often without consent.Last July, the department shared a painting by Thomas Kinkade, an American artist known for his idyllic depictions of American life. The homeland security departmentpostedthe image on X with the message “Protect the homeland”, highlighting Kinkade’s mid-century suburban landscape, complete with schoolchildren, vintage cars and people gathered around an American flag.In response, the Kinkade Family Foundationissueda statement condemning the use of the painting, saying: “The use of his artwork was unauthorized, and we have requested that DHS remove the post.”It added: “At the Kinkade Family Foundation, we strongly condemn the sentiment expressed in the post and the deplorable actions that DHS continues to carry out. Like many of you, we were deeply troubled to see this image used to promote division and xenophobia associated with the ideals of DHS, as this is antithetical to our mission.”The department has also drawn the ire of pop stars for using popular songs to promote deportation efforts in upbeat TikTok-style videos.Last November, Olivia Rodrigo criticized the White House for using her songall-american bitchin a video encouraging undocumented immigrants to self-deport.“Don’t ever use my songs to promote your racist, hateful propaganda,” the 22-year-old Filipino American singer wrote. In response, the department said: “America is grateful all the time for our federal law enforcement officers who keep us safe. We suggest Ms Rodrigo thank them for their service, not belittle their sacrifice.”A few weeks later, Sabrina Carpenter garnered headlines after she condemned the White House for using her song Juno to promote videos of immigration raids on X.Replyingto the since deleted video, which featured several Immigration Customs and Enforcement officials arresting people in what appeared to be Chicago, Carpenter wrote: “This video is evil and disgusting. Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Electric carmakers have been forced to cut prices aggressively, and governments around the world have rolled back targets on the shift away from petrol.Tesla’s sales appear to have suffered in large part because of the withdrawal of electric vehicle (EV) subsidies by Donald Trump. The US president has also removed emissions regulations that incentivised electric car production. And Tesla also faced a backlash from some consumers afterMusk’s embrace of far-right politicsat the end of 2024.View image in fullscreenTesla’s sales last year were down by 9% compared with 2024.Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/APTesla’s deliveries slumped to 418,200 in the final quarter of the year, below the average forecasts of analysts. Sales for 2025 were down by 9% compared with 2024.An average compiled by Bloomberg had suggested that Tesla would deliver 441,000 vehicles during the quarter, but Tesla took the unusual step before the new year ofpublishing its own consensus estimate for the first time, apparently in an effort to guide investors that sales were expected to be lower.Tesla’s share price was down 1% on Friday, although they were down by 8% since Christmas Eve.Trump’s anti-EV policies came despite Musk donating more money than anyone else to the victorious 2024 presidential election campaign and briefly running an effort to cut government costs. Musk at first seemed to win support for EVs from Trump – and even an awkward photoshoot in a Tesla in front of the White House – but theyfell out dramatically in the summer.It was the second consecutive decline in annual sales for Tesla. Yet even as sales have fallen it remains by far the world’s most valuable carmaker, with shares valued at $1.4tn – more than the next 30 carmakers combined. Investors appear to be betting that Musk will lead Tesla to be a leading force in robotics and artificial intelligence.Musk has consistently claimed that autonomous capabilities will set Tesla apart from rivals, and it has started operating alimited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. However, it will still face competition on that front. Several Chinese carmakers and tech companies already have comparable technology, including an offering from BYD called “God’s Eye” that is now included even on its cheapest cars.BYD’s electric car sales rose by 28% during the year despite a weaker performance in December.BYD was founded in 1995 as a battery company byWang Chuanfu, who is often described as China’s equivalent to Musk. Its business already produced more cars overall than Tesla when counting hybrids.The Shenzhen-headquartered manufacturer hasovertaken Tesla during single quarters before. However, its battery electric production pulled away from its US rival in 2025, even as it faced intense competition from Chinese rivals.BYD recorded 4.55m car sales overall during 2025, although its sales of plug-in hybrids fell by 8% year on year to 2.29m. That came despite an uptick in sales of plug-in hybrids, combining a smaller battery with a petrol or diesel engine, in some markets from consumers worried about their ability to charge. BYD also more than doubled its sales of commercial vehicles, including electric buses and lorries, to 57,000.Explore more on these topicsAutomotive industryTeslaElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsnewsShareReuse this content"

However, the DoC said that it had not yet made a final decision on the level of duties that will be imposed on the pasta producers.It said that a preliminary analysis published earlier this week showed that Italian pasta makers had “addressed many of [the DoC’s] questions”.The final results of its analysis will be announced on 12 March, at which time a final decision on import duties will be made.The US has said that the 13 companies it is targeting account for roughly 16% of pasta imported from Italy to the US. Coldiretti, Italy’s agribusiness association, had warned that the tariffs would be a“fatal blow”to the country’s pasta industry.The European Commission had said it would intervene in the dispute if necessary.Italy’s foreign ministry said the preliminary review indicated that the rate of duty imposed on La Molisana would be cut to 2.26% and the tariff on Garofalo would be set at about 14%. The remaining 11 pasta producers will face tariffs of 9.09%.“The recalculation of the duties is a sign that US authorities recognise our companies’ constructive willingness to cooperate,” the ministry said.The shift of position on pasta tariffs came a day after the US administration said it was delaying tariff increases on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities for another year.Import duties on kitchen cabinets and vanities had been set to rise from 25% to 50% on 1 January, while the duty on upholstered furniture was to go up from 25% to 30%.The White House said the US continued to “engage in productive negotiations with trade partners”.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsItalyInternational tradePastaFood & drink industryFoodEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

No details of the national security issues were provided by the White House and weeks later a federal judge allowed Ørsted to restart work on the project.At the time, Sheldon Whitehouse, theRhode Islandsenator and ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee, said: “If Trump’s plan is to raise families’ energy prices, cut American jobs, turbo charge climate change, and accelerate the Great Climate Insurance Crisis,he’s knocking it out of the parkwith his all-out attack on American offshore wind.”Construction is now almost 90% complete and the site had been due to begin delivering “reliable, affordable power” to US homes in 2026. Ørsted said it had already installed all offshore foundations and 58 of the project’s 65 wind turbines.Ørsted shares, which had taken another 12% plunge after the 22 December announcement, were lifted by nearly 4% on Friday on news of the court action.Explore more on these topicsØrstedRenewable energyEnergy industryDonald TrumpClimate crisisDenmarknewsShareReuse this content"

When he told them he might leave the program to focus on his studies, he said, they burst into tears.“The fact that I had such an impact on these kids led me to reconsider my career,” said Curatolo, 22. He is now a seventh- and eighth-grade social studies teacher, based in New York City.Amid a nationwidedeclineof teaching, Curatolo is not alone: a striking number of gen Z graduates are entering the classroom, despite longstanding concerns over pay and conditions.School closures have rocked this LA-area district – are they destroying it, or saving it?Read moreTeach For America (TFA), a non-profit education organization, experienced a near 43% increase in applicants for teaching fellowships over the past three years.A generation whose formative years were spent in isolation during the Covid-19 lockdown is “craving human connection and experiences that feel real”, suggested Whitney Petersmeyer, TFA’s chief growth and program officer. “Teaching is the job where they can find that.”Gen Z is “responding to the opportunity for purpose and responsibility at a time where many entry jobs feel uncertain or disconnected from impact”, she added.During periods of economic uncertainty and turbulence, college graduates have been known to turn to industries fields with major shortages, like education.“As someone who witnessed the economic downturn of 2008, it’s possible we will see an uptick once these gen Zers realize they don’t have many other employment options,” Deirdre Armitage, director of clinical collaborations at the College of Staten Island, wrote in an email.Luke Van De Vijver, 23, a third-grade math teacher in Fairfax, Virginia, found his love for teaching through a part-time job. He was a classroom monitor, tasked with smoothing the transition from online to in-person for elementary students after the pandemic lockdown. By the end of the year, he had switched his university major in film to education.“You hear a lot of negative things about education, and if it’s worth it or not,” he said. “But just making an impact, and the sense of community I felt in the elementary school system, made me realize that this job is going to work out.”This generation came of age “in a rapidly changing world,” Randi Weingarten, president of American Teachers Federation, said in a statement, “and that lived experience helps them relate to students in powerful ways.”New arrivals in the classroom are bringing a new perspective, according to Weingarten. “They’re reimagining how we teach, bringing new approaches to technology and social-emotional learning.”Social and emotional learning exercises include mindfulness and journaling. Such check-ins “help open the students up”, said Curatolo, who introduced the exercises to his students. “If something’s going on mentally, they don’t have to stay isolated and let that emotion build.”Van De Vijver is similarly concentrated on students’ social development alongside academic progress. “My philosophy is focused much more on being a good human at this age,” he said. “If they leave my classroom, as someone who is willing to help others, who keeps an open mind and is caring, as long as they also don’t get zeros on everything, then I feel like I have done a good job teaching.”Others are rethinking the content and structure of lessons themselves.“I was frustrated with how I was taught history which never mentally challenged me or engaged in meaningful, nuanced discussions or debates,” Samuel Ramey, a seventh-grade social studies teacher in Cincinnati, Ohio, said. “I teach my students how to participate in healthy discourse and become active learners.”Ramey also held a weeklong mini-unit focused on how core content in class can help the students analyze current events, and think critically, rather than simply accepting something at face value. “We all struggle with media literacy, but I need to remind my students we cannot be lazy when it comes to investigating something we see online.”With less than desirable pay, high burnout rates and increasing responsibilities, teaching can often be achallenging profession. In the US, educators have also been forced to reckon with danger.“It’s scary when you wake up and see headlines like, ‘Department of Education’s going away’, and gun violence being a major threat in American schools, and what that means for us,” said Gabriella Sheffler, 25, a sixth- and seventh-grade social studies teacher in San Diego, California.“Being a teacher means being in a constant state of worry.”Notes from students line Sheffler’s classroom walls, serving as reminders of why she teaches. She credits a supportive work environment, and a strong commitment to work-life balance, with ultimately making teaching sustainable for her.About 53% of teachers report burnout and 16% expressed wishes to resign due to wellbeing and compensation, according to recentresearchby Rand, a non-profit institute. If schools want to attract and retain more gen Z teachers,Petersmeyer said: “Salaries need to keep pace and reflect the value that is being created by teachers.”But astudyconducted by the Century Foundation, an independent thinktank, found that US schools are underfunded by about $150bn annually.“Gen Z educators are choosing the classroom because they believe in making a difference in our students’ lives,” said Weingarten. “If we want this generation to stay and lead, and we do, we must meet their commitment with fair wages, respect, and the professional support they deserve.”Explore more on these topicsUS educationTeachingYoung peopleSchool fundingSchoolsCareersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The move means drivers make a contract directly with their passengers – so they must charge any VAT due on the fare, while Uber only adds VAT to its commission.As most drivers are not thought to be making more than £90,000 in bookings a year, and therefore do not have to charge VAT, the majority of Uber fares outside London will avoid becoming more expensive, since the 20% sales tax will not apply.The new contracts do not relate to London, where the agency model is not allowed under Transport for London rules. As a result, Uber passengers in the capital will pay VAT on their fares.Uber’s change to the terms with its drivers has been expected since the budget announcement.At the time, Andrew Brem, Uber’s regional general manager for the UK,said: “The government’s action today to change the rules will mean higher prices for passengers in London, and less work for drivers, when people are already struggling with the cost of living … This decision also establishes the absurd situation where a trip in London will be taxed at a different rate than a trip anywhere else in the UK.”An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “Ending this use of a niche tax scheme by online minicab firms will both benefit everyday cabbies with a fairer tax system and raise money to help deliver the country’s priorities – cutting the cost of living, cutting waiting lists, and cutting debt and borrowing.”It did not say if Uber’s changes would affect its estimate of “protecting” £700m a year of receipts from the new policy.Explore more on these topicsUberTax and spendingPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

There are fears it will eventually try to annex the island by force.map of the 12 countries that maintain diplomatic ties with TaiwanTaiwan has never been ruled by the People’s Republic of China and has its own constitution. Its population has grown increasingly opposed to China’s claims of sovereignty over it, electing a succession of leaders who have pledged to uphold its self-governing status.The Guardian disclosed last yearthat the Foreign Office had intervened to postpone a planned visit by the former Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen because it coincided with David Lammy’s first trip to China as foreign secretary.The Chinese government strongly condemned a visit to Taiwan by a Labour party parliamentary delegation in the spring of 2024, while the party was still in opposition.The UK does not recognise Taiwan as a country but has a longstanding unofficial relationship with its government, including via ministerial talks, which have been held since 1991. Bilateral trade between the UK and Taiwan was worth £9.3bn last year.British warships have taken part in operations in the waters around Taiwan in recent years, which has angered China.Meanwhile ministers have come under pressure from opposition parties and campaigners over their diplomatic rapprochement with Beijing.The government is preparing to approve controversial plans to build a Chinese super-embassy near Tower Bridge in Londonafter receiving the green light from the security services. Keir Starmer is planning to travel to Beijing for his first bilateral visit in late January.Critics have argued that the embassy presents a security risk. UK intelligence agencies have repeatedly warned of large-scale Chinese espionage targeting government, industry and academia.Downing Street has argued that consolidating all of China’s diplomatic presence in London into one building will have a security benefit.A government spokesperson said: “We continue to engage with China in areas of trade that benefit our national interests. Our longstanding position on Taiwan has not changed and this visit was within the expected and longstanding bounds of our relationship.“We continue to explore a range of opportunities to further enhance our trade relations and support economic growth as part of our objective to strengthen bilateral trade and investment between the UK and Taiwan.”The business department said the Jetco talks that took place in September would help secure £1bn in market access deals for the UK over five years.It was the first set of such talks since 2018, when diplomatic relations with China began to deteriorate and dialogue became more difficult because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Explore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaTrade policynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not just hockey - it’s hockey with the best players in the world,” said Molly Solomon, executive producer & president, for NBC’s Olympics and Paralympics Production.North American players make up the majority of the NHL, with hockey-mad Canada leading the pack and their longtime foes United States second, setting the chance for one of Olympic hockey’s great rivalries to renew in Milan.Broadcasters will hope to make the most of that opportunity, after a politically charged 4 Nations Face-Off final between the United States and Canada delivered a record 9.3m viewers on ESPN last year.“A USA-Canada medal-round matchup? That’s appointment viewing,” Solomon told Reuters.“With NHL players back and the buzz from the 4 Nations tournament, hockey becomes one of those tentpole events that everyone talks about.”The United States men have not won gold since the 1980 tournament that featured their “Miracle on Ice” triumph over the USSR and pre-dated the NHL’s participation in the Games by 18 years.Canada most recently won the tournament in 2010 and 2014.The United States filled out their 2022 team with collegiate talent and players competing in international leagues after the NHL abruptly pulled out weeks before the Beijing Games.But the availability of American NHL players will be a game-changer, said USA Hockey Executive Director Pat Kelleher, who boldly predicted a US gold medal sweep across the men’s, women’s and Paralympic competitions.“What this means is we get our best players,” Kelleher told reporters during a recent “Inside Edge” media summit hosted by Aggregate Sports.“We don’t take a back seat to anybody in hockey anymore.” The US Olympic and Paralympic Committee welcomed 44 players from 24 different NHL teams to a camp in August, after the US men’s team picked up their first world championship gold medal in 92 years in May.While the US roster contains just two returnees from the 2022 Beijing Games, thanks to the long NHL hiatus, the USOPC has taken a “hands-off approach” to the men’s team, according to Rocky Harris, the NGB’s chief of sport and athlete services.“We’re thrilled that NHL is back in the Games. We think that’s going to do a lot, not only for the sport of hockey, but for our country to get excited about the Games in a way that we haven’t seen in quite some time,” Harris said at a recent USOPC media summit.“Now it’s about the right coaching and the right game plan. And USA Hockey has that in place right now.”US men’s team pick 4 Nations-heavy roster for OlympicsTage Thompson and Clayton Keller helped the US win the world hockey championshipfor the first time since 1933, while Seth Jones was a key part of the Florida Panthers’ second consecutive Stanley Cup run.Those contributions earned them a spot on the S. team at the Milan CortinaWinter Olympicsas the only three additions from the 4 Nations Face-Off early last year.USA Hockey unveiled its roster Friday on the Today show, with a vast majority of it made up of players who took part in the NHL-run international tournament in February, when the Americans made the final before losing to Canada in overtime. The only ones not back from the 4 Nations are forward Chris Kreider and former New York Rangers defenseman Adam Fox.“It was incredibly difficult for our management group to get to the final roster and that’s a credit to so many in our country, including all those at the grassroots level who help make our sport so strong,” general manager Bill Guerin said. “There’s nothing like the Olympics and I know our players and staff will represent our country well and work hard to achieve our ultimate goal.”Keller, who’s captain of the Utah Mammoth and tied for their lead in scoring, wore the “C” at worlds. Thompson, who plays for the Buffalo Sabres, was a point-a-game producer.View image in fullscreenHillary Knight will set an American record in her sport with her fifth Winter Olympics appearance after winning gold in 2018 and three silver medals.Photograph: David W Černý/ReutersThe US followed Canada’s lead after its northern neighbor also chose a 4 Nations-heavy roster. But while Canada made some changes in net beyond starter Jordan Binnington, the Americans went with the same three goaltenders: Connor Hellebuyck, Jake Oettinger and Jeremy Swayman.Left off were Jason Robertson of the Dallas Stars, who’s leads US players in points this season, and a couple other elite goal scorers, Cole Caufield and Alex DeBrincat.Guerin and his management staff, along with coach Mike Sullivan, prioritized experience and players they knew well. That meant sticking with depth forwards Vincent Trocheck and Brock Nelson over Robertson and others.Teams are allowed 25 players at the Olympics, up from 23 at the 4 Nations, and can dress 20 skaters – typically 13 forwards and seven defenseman, along with two goalies. The first US men’s game is 12 February against Latvia.Knight leads US women’s Olympic hockey rosterOlympic veteran Hilary Knight leads the US women’s hockey team, also unveiled on Friday for the Milano Cortina Games.Knight, 36, will set an American record in her sport with her fifth Winter Olympics appearance after winning gold in 2018 and three silver medals.The 23-member Team USA roster features only 11 returning members of the silver medal-winning team from 2022 in Beijing. The roster includes 16 current PWHL players.Newcomers include 21-year-old Wisconsin senior Laila Edwards, who will become the first Black women’s player to represent the US in the Winter Games.“It still hasn’t really kicked in yet. Getting that call is like a dream come true,” Edwards said, per the Associated Press. “Always had dreams of playing in the pros, but the biggest dream was to go the Olympics, for sure.”Coached by John Wroblewski, the US are considered the favorite for gold. The Americans open play against Czechia on 5 February and the championship game is scheduled for 19 February.These are the first Olympics since the PWHL began play in 2024, with the now eight-team league expected to make an impact by raising the level of international competition and bridging the gap among nations trailing the two global powers US and Canada.The US roster features 16 PWHL players.Explore more on these topicsUSA ice hockey teamWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamUS sportsWinter OlympicsShareReuse this content"

Will the Ravens take revenge on the Steelers to grab the AFC North title? Can the Panthers cling on against the Buccaneers and claim the NFC South? Will either winner make it past the first round next week?What we can be more confident about is this: once the dust settles in Tampa, the cream of the NFC will collide on the west coast. Seattle head to the Bay Area for a Saturday night showdown with San Francisco, with the No 1 seed at stake. Both rivals arrive red hot on six-game winning streaks, desperate to avoid a defeat that would forfeit a bye week and force a wildcard road trip. The tension will be sky high.What the Seahawks need to do to winNothing. Absolutely nothing. Do not even consider tinkering with a defense playing this well. Seattle have conceded 18.1 points per game this season, the second-fewest in theNFL, and their 44 sacks rank eighth overall. Brock Purdy will have his work cut out against a fierce pass rush and may have to do it without future Hall of Fame left tackle Trent Williams, who injured a hamstring against the Bears. Without his protector-in-chief, Purdy could be spraying pick-ready passes all over the field.The offense, meanwhile, needs to relax. The 49ers have a habit of making quarterbacks look like world-beaters, no effort required. Remind Sam Darnold that Cardinals journeyman Jacoby Brissett set an NFL record for completions against San Francisco this season. Get the ball to Jaxson Smith-Njigba and let the points flow. Interceptions should not be a major concern: even though Darnold leads the league with 20, the 49ers have managed just six all season. Easy does it.What the 49ers need to do to winStop the run. Seattle have thrived through Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet as defenses remain wary of Smith-Njigba’s deep threat. Run defense is the only consistently solid facet of San Francisco’s unit. In the season opener between these teams, the 49ers held Charbonnet to 47 yards on 12 carries and Walker to 20 yards on 10 attempts. Seattle stalled, and San Francisco escaped with a 17-13 win.Nick Bosa’s last-gasp strip-sack that day killed a late comeback at Lumen Field. Without him, however, the pass rush has been abysmal, producing a league-worst 18 sacks. For context, the Jets have eight more in 31st place, while the Broncos have 46 more at the top. Without pressure on the sometimes shaky Darnold, the 49ers must sell out to shut down the run. Force Seattle to place the No 1 seed on Darnold’s shoulders – a big ask for a quarterback with a habit of retreating into his shell under the spotlight, as seen in last season’s wildcard loss to the Rams.Rising: Houston TexansHouston remain strangely under the Super Bowl contender radar despite being the NFL’s form team, riding a league-best eight-game winning streak. How are the 11-5 Texans pulling this off? A mix of factors. Sitting second to Jacksonville in the AFC South helps, though they can still clinch the division by beating the Colts if the Jaguars lose to the Titans. Their 3-5 start, marred by a sputtering offense, also lingers in perception.Will CJ Stroud and co regress when the stakes rise? Possibly. But if Jacksonville and Houston both win on Sunday, a relatively forgiving trip to Baltimore or Pittsburgh awaits. The Texans’ ferocious defense should overwhelm either opponent, setting Stroud up for a third consecutive AFC divisional-round appearance. With battle-hardened experience from two previous failures – and a potential matchup in Denver, where defenses have rattled Bo Nix – Houston could be poised for a first conference championship appearance in franchise history.View image in fullscreenCJ Stroud has the Houston Texans on an eight-game winning streak.Photograph: Eric Thayer/Los Angeles Times/Getty ImagesFalling: Los Angeles RamsThe Rams’ Christmas period has been brutal. Successive defeats have knocked them from the top of the NFC West to the sixth seed. Their only path to avoiding a daunting road trip to Philadelphia in the wildcard round is to beat the Cardinals and hope Seattle take care of San Francisco.Before Monday’s disastrous loss to Atlanta, Matthew Stafford was the runaway favorite for MVP. After throwing three interceptions, the award now appears safe in Drake Maye’s hands.So what has gone wrong for Sean McVay’s Rams? The offense has unravelled. Wide receiver Davante Adams has been a glaring absence in the red zone. Stafford’s MVP case was built on Adams finishing drives with his one-on-one dominance. An 11-touchdown burst across six games fuelled a 5-1 midseason run. His return cannot come soon enough. Nor can that of left tackle Alaric Jackson and right guard Kevin Dotson. Constant reshuffling up front has left the Rams disjointed, culminating in just the third first-half shutout of the McVay era since 2017. Unless reinforcements arrive quickly, this slide may continue straight out of the playoffs.Race for the No 1 pickThe Raiders have almost done it. Placing their two star players on injured reserve produced the desired catastrophic result against the Giants, leaving Las Vegas with the league’s worst record at 2-14. A loss to another broken side, the Chiefs, would secure the top pick – but will Andy Reid really be outfoxed by a team actively trying to lose in what may be Travis Kelce’s final game? Unlikely.The race for No 2 is even messier. Four teams sit at 3-13: the Jets, Giants, Titans and Cardinals. Their opponents – the Bills, Cowboys, Jaguars and Rams – include three playoff teams and an angry Dallas side. Relief is unlikely, with none eager to rest starters. If all four lose, the draft order falls to the Giants second, Jets third, Titans fourth and Cardinals fifth on strength of schedule.If the season ended today …AFC1) Denver 13-3; 2) New England 13-3; 3) Jacksonville 12-4; 4) Pittsburgh 9-7; 5) Houston 11-5; 6) LA Chargers 11-5; 7) Buffalo 11-5.

Yes, Hollander, I’m going to tell everyone.” Hollander reinforces the point: “Because no one can know,” he says. Rozanov utters something under his breath in Russian, then: “Hollander. Look, I’m not going to tell anyone, OK?” Hollander replies: “OK.”No one can know. If hockey were to have an unofficial slogan, this might be it. Heated Rivalry, the surprise 2025 hit series from Crave andHBO, is layered drama, prompting timely questions about the barriers to acceptance that persist within sport even as they are lowered elsewhere across society. But it may be that hockey’s existential battle with its culture of silence is the show’s deepest target.Minnesota Wild go all-in with blockbuster trade for Norris winner Quinn HughesRead moreHockey culture presents a paradox, simultaneously welcoming yet exclusive. When theNHLlaunched its Hockey Is For Everyone initiative in 2017, the league was making a point about attracting new fans from groups that did not typically see themselves reflected on the ice, including members of the LGBTQ+ community. It was a savvy business move, if nothing else. “Diverse representation within inclusive environments is proven to advance innovation, creativity, and decision-making – all of which are important to the growth of the sport and our business,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman wrote in his introduction to the league’s first report on diversity and inclusion in 2022. Inclusion, Bettman wrote, is a “driver for performance … individuals and organizations grow stronger from uniting across differences”. Times were changing, lessons were being learned. Briefly, anyway. The 2022 “annual” report has since been scrubbed from the NHL’s website (it remains available elsewhere). And while the league continues to work on inclusivity initiatives and claims it is attracting more women fans, there has not been another report since.Just a few months after that diversity report’s release, in January 2023, Ivan Provorov, then a defenseman for the Philadelphia Flyers,refused to wear a Pride-themed jerseyduring a pre-game warm-up, saying it conflicted with his religious beliefs. The jerseys had been introduced as part of the Hockey Is For Everyone initiative and were typically auctioned afterwards to raise money for local charities. In the weeks that followed, more players refused to wear their team’s Pride jersey. Rather than push back or make the jerseys a requirement like any other aspect of a team’s uniform, the NHL officially walked away from it all, eliminating the jerseys. The whole thing had “just become more of a distraction from really the essence of what the purpose of these nights are,” Bettman said that summer.View image in fullscreenA Canucks player uses Pride tape on his stick during a 2024 game in Vancouver, British Columbia.Photograph: Jeff Vinnick/NHLI/Getty ImagesIn hockey, nobody wants to be a distraction. “[The players told me] it doesn’t matter if you’re gay, or concussed, or you’ve been sexually abused or have mental health issues, none of those are OK because you are a distraction,” Cheryl MacDonald, former co-chair of the western Canadian board of You Can Play, said of her interviews with a handful of gay hockey players in 2019. MacDonald had wondered why more gay players did not choose to come out. “You don’t want to risk it not being OK, because the perception is someone who is just as good at your job but isn’t gay is going to take your spot,” she said at the time. Better to say nothing at all.”In the penultimate episode of Heated Rivalry, another gay player unexpectedly invites his boyfriend on to the ice to help celebrate a championship win. They kiss in front of tens of thousands of fans and, presumably, millions of viewers at home. It is a public coming out. The show pivots immediately to how this impacts Hollander and Rozanov and offers very little sense of how the kiss was received more broadly, but amid the on-ice embrace, the crowd appears enraptured, not appalled. The TV announcer simply says: “You don’t see that every day.” Well, no. But if we did?In the same 2019 study, MacDonald also found that once gay players did come out, their teammates generally reacted positively – and the typical homophobic jibes that persist in hockey locker rooms were muted. Moreover, the banter eventually incorporated their orientation, with straight players more respectfully making light of the gay players’ sexuality. “The gay players said the acknowledgement was nice … it seems there is room for consensual humor,” MacDonald noted. Likely, few in the hockey world would find that surprising either; just part of the frustrating paradox at the heart of its culture.Heated Rivalry’s popularity has prompted plenty of speculation about whether it will attract new fans to hockey and to the NHL. But they are already here – watching, spending, supporting. Playing. And learning, often from a young age, what part of themselves they should keep quiet because, y’know, no one can know. As for the NHL, in December, a spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter that “there are so many ways to get hooked on hockey and, in the NHL’s 108-year history, this might be the most unique driver for creating new fans. See you at the rink.” The line is cheerful, harmless and, in typical fashion, empty. Even when the conversation is unavoidable, the NHL still has little to say. It seems that for the league, this is not about hockey. It is still just a distraction.Explore more on these topicsNHLIce hockeyUS sportsHBOTelevisionUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That does not mean the club’s structure needs a complete overhaulFri 2 Jan 2026 13.21 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 18.42 ESTShareSome clubs build around their manager. Eddie Howe is hugely influential at Newcastle and Aston Villa are pretty much Unai Emery FC these days.Chelsea, though, have adopted an alternative model. They have a team of five sporting directors, led by Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, and do not want one person to hold all the power.Yet the question many are asking in the wake ofEnzo Maresca’s demiseis whether the template will yield success at the very highest level. It is never quiet at Chelsea. They are often busy in the transfer market, meaning there is an element of players coming and going, and they are now looking for their fifth permanent head coach since a consortium led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, a private equity firm run by Behdad Eghbali and José E Feliciano, bought the club from Roman Abramovich in 2022.Liam Rosenior opens door to Chelsea job but must wait on BlueCo dealingsRead moreHowever, accusations that the swift unravelling of Maresca’s tenure proves that Chelsea have become unmanageable and lack the stability to compete for the title are over the top. True, they have a young squad and remain short of experience in some key positions. The idea they have failed, though, is not supported by results. It is worth remembering Arsenal had six years away from the Champions League before returning in 2023, whereas Chelsea only had to deal with a two-year hiatus before they regained a spot in Europe’s top club competition.Chelsea are champions of the worldand it is not so long ago that pundits were talking them up as title contenders. The narrative flips quickly. It is premature for the talk to return to chaos after one rotten month, even if Chelsea have dropped to fifth after one league win in seven games and will have their Under-21s coach, Calum McFarlane, in temporary charge when they visit Manchester City on Sunday.There is no panic within the club. Chelsea parting company with Maresca will not change the structure. Chelsea tailored their recruitment to suit Maresca’s stylistic demands. The Italian wanted wingers who could hug the touchline, so he was given Alejandro Garnacho and Pedro Neto. He loved Liam Delap, so thestriker was bought from Ipswich. This was not the work of a dictatorship. The bigger lesson is that Chelsea cannot accept any employee in a leadership position trying to game their way into greater influence.View image in fullscreenEnzo Maresca was not denied by his employers in the transfer market. He wanted wingers who suited his style and Alejandro Garnacho and Pedro Neto were brought in.Photograph: ZUMA Press Inc/AlamyMaresca changed, not Chelsea. The answer is clear. Sources felt a shift in the Italian’s demeanour after he outwitted Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final last summer. Insiders say Chelsea were unimpressed when Maresca told them a new improved contract would make him halt flirtations with City, Juventus and a third unnamed club. There was shock at the 45-year-old trying to throw his weight around after 18 months in the job.It is supposed to be a partnership between club and head coach; everyone pulling in the same direction. On that note, there is an anecdote that reveals much about Chelsea’s thinking. It concerns Winstanley and Stewart being told that one of the metrics on which their work would be judged was whether they were willing to add high-grade individuals to their team. The challenge was to share responsibility. One of the reasons why Winstanley and Stewart are valued as leaders is because they were not afraid to have Joe Shields, Sam Jewell and Dave Fallows working under them.Maresca was supposed to fit into that structure. But when he talked about his“worst 48 hours”at the club and said he felt a lack of support, it is claimed he was ultimately referring to not being allowed to go against the medical department’s advice on starting certain players. It was not about tactics. Chelsea know it would cross a red line if they were interfering with their manager’s team selection.It is true that Chelsea, who lack a world-class goalkeeper and ruthless striker, look more like a cup team than one capable of challenging for the title. Yet this is a long-term project. Maresca was never under pressure to win the title this season. Chelsea have been building for future challenges. Time will tell if their model is right. It is too soon to be sure.But it is reactive to think thatMaresca’s fallshows it is time to start over. After all, if Chelsea really were unmanageable they would have sacked Maresca when he barely won a league game from January to March last season. Instead, they assessed the data behind performances, concluded he was moving in the right direction and stuck with him.At the same time it is fair to wonder whether Chelsea have placed too much faith in the numbers and have overlooked the unquantifiable marginal gains offered by the very best managers. Those coaches are by their nature demanding, difficult and possess raging egos. They want readymade talent and power. They pay their bosses back by giving their teams inspiration in the defining moments.View image in fullscreenPaul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart believe they did not interfere unfairly with Enzo Maresca’s tenure at Chelsea.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyYet Chelsea see plenty of cases where a manager having full control has ended badly. They will not budge, but they will keep handing out opportunities to young prospects. If it is to be Liam Rosenior then the 41-year-old will be given time to make it work. He is at Strasbourg, Chelsea’s partner club, and understands the demands.If he joins he will be working with Reece James, Moisés Caicedo, Cole Palmer and Estêvão Willian. There are worse jobs.Explore more on these topicsChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

He is due to appear in court on 20 January.The Federal Road Safety Corps inNigeriasaid they believed the vehicle was travelling “beyond the legally prescribed speed limit”.Kayode was driving the former world heavyweight boxing champion, Joshua, 36, his personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, on 29 December on a busy highway linking Lagos and Ibadan in south-west Nigeria.The Lexus SUV was travelling at high speed when the tyre on the passenger side burst while trying to overtake a vehicle. The Lexus crashed into a stationary lorry carrying soya beans that was illegally parked on the hard shoulder of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, 30 miles from Lagos. Ayodele and Ghami, both 36, died at the scene.The 46-year-old driver is a longstanding member of the boxer’s team, and was granted bail of 5m naira (£2,580), but will remain in custody until he meets bail conditions.‘Stay strong, champion’: boxing world offers condolences to Anthony JoshuaRead moreThe driver and Joshua survived with minor injuries, but Kayode was taken to the Lagoon hospital in Ikoyi and kept under observation for two days. After the crash, Joshua and his mother paid their respects to the boxer’s friends at the funeral home.The accident occurred 10 days after the former world champion celebrated hisvictory against the YouTuber Jake Paul in the US. Prior to the crash, Joshua was believed to be preparing to return to the boxing ring early this year.After the crash, the Ogun state government said in a statement: “Anthony Joshua and another passenger were immediately evacuated to a specialised medical facility in Lagos.“Following comprehensive clinical assessments, doctors have confirmed that both patients are stable and do not require any emergency medical intervention at this time.

In today’s Pitch Points column, we address three of the big ones for 2026Graham RuthvenFri 2 Jan 2026 04.21 ESTFirst published on Thu 1 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTShareHow will the US (the soccer team and the country) fare at the 2026 World Cup?You may have heard there’s a World Cup this year. After all the debate aboutticket pricesandpeace prizesandcooling breaks, an actual soccer tournament will kick off. That’s when the US, both as a national team and a host nation, will truly be judged; when the 2026 World Cup will be deemed a soaring success or a grotesque failure. There will be no in between. No nuance. That vanished from public discourse a long time ago.Fifa has already taken its victory lap, boasting about a record 150 million ticket applications. How many of those applications came from bots, it didn’t specify. Gianni Infantino did, however, claim Fifa’s exorbitant ticket prices are justifiable because without supporters being squeezed for every penny “there would be no football in 150 countries in the world.” Apparently the $7.5bn in revenue Fifa made over the lastWorld Cupcycle wasn’t enough.The USMNT is also expecting an improvement on the 2022 World Cup. A run beyond the round of 16 would represent success for Mauricio Pochettino and his players who went through a sometimes painful process in 2025. From theConcacaf Nations League lossesto Panama and Canada to the friendly victories over Japan, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay, the yearended more positivelythan it started. Will this lead to a strong showing at the World Cup itself?Further questions will be answered next summer. Will President Donald Trump’scosy relationship with Infantinohave any impact on where World Cup matches are played – and where they aren’t? How will fans from countriescurrently subject to a travel banattend matches? Could the searing heat of a North American summer affect the intensity of games? On and off the field, the USA’s measure will be taken.View image in fullscreenArsenal are on top of the Premier League as the new year begins.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockCan Arsenal hold their nerve to end their long wait for Premier League glory?Arsenal have been here before. Exactly four times, to be exact. Each of those four times the Gunners have been top at Christmas they have failed to win the Premier League title. Mikel Arteta could therefore be forgiven for chowing down his turkey and stuffing somewhat nervously this year even with his team in first place.Not least because Manchester City are getting larger and larger in the rearview mirror. There’s good reason to be wary of Pep Guardiola’s team considering they have won their last six league fixtures in a row. What was not so long ago seen as a transitional season for City could turn into another title winning one.Arteta says Arsenal are “actively looking” at potential signings in January. A mid-season addition or two could help push the Gunners towards the finish line ahead of City, Aston Villa and everyone else. However, Arsenal’s substantial summer business was meant to be enough to make them champions.Viktor Gyökeres was supposed to be their Erling Haaland. Instead, the Swedish striker has scored just five goals in 17 league games. Eberechi Eze was signed to give them a different dimension in the final third. Since netting a hat-trick in November’s North London Derby, though, the England international has gone four league games without a goal contribution. Noni Madueke – another summer signing – has missed much of the season through injury.The experience of previous title race failures might help Arsenal handle this specific sprint to the finish. Alternatively, past traumas could add to their nervousness which already appears to be building on the basis of recent shaky victories over Wolves, Everton and Brighton.Tuesday’s emphatic win against Villawas a release of some tension and possibly a sign that Arsenal are embracing the fight. The second half of the season will be a reckoning for Arteta’s title challengers.View image in fullscreenXabi Alonso is attempting to oversee a shift in culture at Real Madrid.Photograph: Pankra Nieto/ReutersWho will win the power struggle for the soul of Real Madrid?If Xabi Alonso was ever complacent about the task of overhauling Real Madrid’s playing style and overall culture, he surely isn’t now. Hired in the summer to drag the Spanish giants into a new era, the former midfielder has encountered everything that makesLos Blancosan anomaly in the modern game.Under Alonso, Bayer Leverkusen pressed high. They won the ball back quickly in advanced areas and were among the Bundesliga’s best in possession. Alonso’s Real Madrid side, however, are nothing like the team that surged to the German title two seasons ago. They don’t press high. They don’t win the ball back quickly in advanced areas and they are often lacking in possession.That could be because Real Madrid don’t have players capable of doing these things. Or it could be because they have players unwilling to do these things, Vinicius Junior possibly among them. The Brazilian’s frosty relationship with Alonso is well documented, raising questions over his future at the Santiago Bernabéu beyond this season.This season has been more than just the start of a new managerial tenure, it’s been apower struggle for Real Madrid’s soul. One way or another, 2026 will be a watershed year. Either Alonso’s methods will start to take root, perhaps after some high-profile departures, or the 44-year-old will be spat out by a club that refuses to swallow its medicine.Explore more on these topicsFootballUSAWorld Cup 2026US sportsWorld CupfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Both scored touchdowns early in the fourth quarter.The bowl loss was the biggest in Alabama history. The Crimson Tide (11-4) had not lost a bowl by more than 32 points. It was also their largest loss of any kind since 1998.Indiana controlled the game from the start, forcing Alabama to punt on its first drive before the Hoosiers engineered a 16-play drive that lasted nearly nine minutes, ending in a Nicolas Radicic 31-yard field goal.Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer then decided to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the Crimson Tide 34 moments later in the second quarter, with Isaiah Jones and Rolijah Hardy stopping Germie Bernard just short of the first-down marker.Four plays later, Mendoza hit Charlie Becker for a 21-yard touchdown for a 10-0 lead and kept the momentum firmly on Indiana’s side.Late in the quarter, D’Angelo Ponds delivered a big hit on Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson, knocking the ball out and appearing to injure Simpson. Jones recovered the ball and Mendoza led Indiana on an 11-play, 58-yard touchdown drive.The drive ended on Mendoza’s one-yard scoring pass to Omar Cooper in the closing seconds of the half, putting the Hoosiers up 17-0.Simpson returned for the opening drive of the second half but after the Crimson Tide went three-and-out, and Mendoza led a nearly six-minute touchdown drive to make it 24-0, Simpson was replaced by Austin Mack.Simpson completed 12 of 16 passes, but had just 67 yards through the air, with just two of his completions going for longer than eight yards.Mack threw for 103 yards, going 11 of 16 in relief of Simpson.Alabama finally got on the board late in the third quarter on Conor Talty’s 28-yard field goal.Oregon 23-0 Texas TechMatayo Uiagalelei forced a fumble that set up an Oregon touchdown, Jordon Davison rushed for two scores and the fifth-seeded Ducks smothered No 4 Texas Tech in a 23-0 win in the College Football Playoff quarter-final at the Orange Bowl on Thursday.Dante Moore threw for 234 yards and Atticus Sappington kicked three field goals for Oregon (13-1), which will play either No 1 Indiana or No 9 Alabama in the Peach Bowl – a CFP semi-final – on 9 January. The winner will return to Miami Gardens for the national championship game on 19 January.Texas Tech (12-2) entered the game ranked second nationally in scoring (42.5 points per game) and fifth in total offense, but never found its footing. The Red Raiders turned the ball over four times, failed on three fourth-down attempts and produced four three-and-outs.Quarterback Behren Morton finished 18 of 32 for 137 yards and was stripped by Uiagalelei early in the third quarter in Tech territory. Uiagalelei returned the fumble into the red zone, and Davison scored on the next play to give Oregon a 13-0 lead.Morton then threw a red-zone interception early in the fourth quarter, before Oregon’s defense stopped Texas Tech on fourth down at its own 30 midway through the final period. Davison’s one-yard touchdown plunge with 16 seconds remaining completed the scoring.View image in fullscreenOregon’s Dante Moore threw for 234 yards in Thursday’s win.Photograph: Megan Briggs/Getty ImagesThe result continued a striking trend in the expanded playoff. Thursday’s game was the sixth quarter-final under the 12-team format introduced last season, and the sixth time a team coming off a first-round bye lost to an opponent that played the opening weekend.In 2024, Boise State, Arizona State, Georgia and Oregon were all eliminated in the quarterfinals after byes, while Miami added to the list on Wednesday by defeating Ohio State at the Cotton Bowl. Across those six games, bye teams have led for less than five minutes of regulation combined.Texas Tech hoped to buck that pattern. Instead, Oregon recorded their first shutout of an AP top-10 opponent since 2012. It was the Ducks’ 113th game against a top-10 team – and the first time they allowed no points.After expressing dissatisfaction with their defense following a 51-34 first-round win over James Madison, Oregon delivered a performance that left little room for complaint.Ole Miss 39-34 GeorgiaLucas Carneiro drilled a tiebreaking 47-yard field goal with six seconds left, propelling No 6 Ole Miss to a 39-34 victory over No.3 Georgia in the College Football Playoff quarter-final at the Sugar Bowl on Thursday in New Orleans.Trinidad Chambliss threw a 40-yard pass to De’Zhaun Stribling on third-and-5 with 26 seconds left, leading to Carneiro’s third field goal of the game.A backwards pass into the end zone on Georgia’s ensuing kickoff return went into the end zone, resulting in a safety with one second left.Chambliss threw for 362 yards and two touchdowns and Kewan Lacy rushed for 99 yards and two scores for Ole Miss (13-1), who will face No 10 Miami in a semi-final game at the Fiesta Bowl on 8 January in Glendale, Ariz.Ole Miss’ Harrison Wallace III made nine receptions for 156 yards and a touchdown, and Stribling hauled in seven catches for 122 yards.Gunner Stockton threw for 215 yards and a touchdown for Georgia (12-2), which saw its second straight season end in the quarterfinals in New Orleans.After Georgia held a nine-point half-time lead, Bulldogs kicker Peyton Woodring had a 55-yard field-goal attempt come up short with 8:33 left in the third. From there, Lacy’s seven-yard touchdown rush cut the Rebels’ deficit to 21-19.Facing a fourth-and-5 from their own 30-yard line, Georgia’s Landon Roldan connected with Lawson Luckie for 16 yards on a fake punt. Woodring’s 37-yarder then put the Bulldogs ahead by five.Ole Miss took its first lead of the second half as Lacy’s five-yard touchdown rush was followed with Chambliss’ two-point conversion pass to Wallace, giving the Rebels a 27-24 lead with 11:29 left in the fourth.Georgia took another gamble on its next drive, going for it on fourth-and-2 from its own 33-yard line. Stockton was sacked, leading to Chambliss’ 13-yard touchdown pass to Wallace, pushing Ole Miss’ lead to 34-24 with 9:02 remaining.The Bulldogs pulled within three as Stockton’s 18-yard touchdown pass to Zachariah Branch stamped a 75-yard scoring drive that lasted just 1:59.After forcing a punt, Georgia faced a fourth-and-9 on its 48, and Stockton connected with Branch for 16 yards. A pair of Ole Miss pass interference penalties set Georgia up with a first-and-goal from the 8-yard line, but the Rebels held the Bulldogs to a game-tying 24-yard field goal from Woodring with 56 seconds left.Carneiro made field goals from 55 and 56 yards in the first quarter, both setting the Sugar Bowl record.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

In 1998, she defeated her younger sister Serena in the second round before losing in the quarter-finals to fellow American Lindsay Davenport.Venus had announced in Novemberthat she would play in Auckland, New Zealand, where she also received a wild card, two weeks before the Australian Open. The Australian Open said Williams was also entered to play a tournament in Hobart, Australia a week later and just before play begins at Melbourne Park.She last appeared in Melbourne in 2021 and has finished runner-up in the women’s singles twice, losing to Serena in the finals in 2003 and 2017.“I’m excited to be back in Australia and looking forward to competing during the Australian summer,” Williams said. “I’ve had so many incredible memories there, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to return to a place that has meant so much to my career.”Williams’ record at Melbourne Park is 54 wins and 21 losses. This year will be the 22nd time she has appeared in the main draw.The tournament said Williams is set to become the oldest woman to compete in an Australian Open main draw, surpassing the record previously held by Japan’s Kimiko Date, who was 44 when she lost in the first round at Melbourne Park in 2015.In late December, Williamsmarried Danish-born model and actor Andrea Pretiat Palm Beach, Florida.Explore more on these topicsVenus WilliamsAustralian OpenTennisUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The global victories were the 19th and 20th of the Norwegian’s illustrious career and may give him the edge in the longstanding debate on whether he, Garry Kasparov, or Bobby Fischer is chess’s all-time greatest master.Peerless endgame technique was central to the 35-year-old Norwegian’s blitz success. He won a knight ending with Blackagainst Nodirbek Abdusattorovfrom a position which elite grandmasters would normally have instantly agreed to halve, and also scored in otherendings of extraordinary subtlety.In between the moments of sublime elegance, there were some episodes that threatened to derail Carlsen’s campaign. He blundered rook for bishop and the game against Vladislav Artemiev in the rapid, then left the building andswatted the camera of a photographerwho approached too near.4005:Vladimir Dabovic v Nebojsa Mitric, Belgrade 2005. White to move and win.Final leading World Rapid scores were Carlsen 10.5/13, Artemiev (Russia, silver medal) and Arjun Erigaisi (India, bronze), both 9.5. The Rapid time control was 15 minutes each for the entire game, plus a 10 seconds per move increment. First prize was €70,000.The World Blitz had 19 rounds of three minutes plus two seconds per move games, followed by semi-finals and final for the top four players. Carlsen blundered a rookagainst Fabiano Caruana,lost on time to Erigaisiafter fumbling a piece, and was on the brink of elimination after round 14, when hespilled several pieceson the board and was adjudged to have forfeited on time to Haik Martirosyan before he could replace them.Carlsen then needed four wins and a draw to qualify for the knockout stage, yet remained confident and continued his policy of aiming for endgamesat every opportunity. He defeated Uzbekistan’s Abdusattorov 2.5-1.5 in their final match, and earned another €70,000.At the closing press conference, Carlsen said that he expected to play two or three classical events during 2026. Translated, this probably means NorwayChessat Stavanger, the Olympiad in Uzbekistan, and the European Club Cup or the Sinquefield Cup in St Louis. Asked which of his 20 world titles had been the hardest, he said the match against Sergey Karjakin in 2016.Russia’s Aleksandra Goryachkina won the World Women’s Rapid after a tie-break with China’s Zhu Jiner. Bibisara Assaubayeva beat Ukraine’s Anna Muzychuk 2.5-1.5 for the World Women’s Blitz. At age 21, it was already the Kazakh star’s third world blitz title.Magnus Carlsen completes rapid-blitz double with ninth world blitz titleRead moreSeveral blunders in the World Blitz had a common feature – overlooking a backward diagonal capture by a queen or bishop. Remember this technique next time you have a lost position in yourchess.comorlichessblitz game – it can save you half a point or more.There were no British competitors in the World Rapid or Blitz, but an English county champion had a notable result. Talab Rami, who won the Cornwall Championship two years ago aged 10 and represents Syria internationally, scored 5.5/13 in the Rapid, defeating two IMs for a TPR of 2325, and 7/19 in the Blitz, defeating three GMs and three IMs, for a TPR of 2350. Both were far above Rami’s official rating in the low 2000s. The Truro schoolboy also performed at 2300+ in the recent Coventry international, so this was no fluke and places Rami up with the best English juniors after GM Shreyas Royal.4005:1 Rxc6+!

The head coach is dealing with numerous problems as he navigates what always stood to be a transitional season, the most insistent being his team’s lack of creativity.Spurs were booed off after Thursday’s0-0 draw at Brentfordby the travelling support, who also chanted “boring, boring Tottenham”. But Frank is confident he will come to look back on the first half of his debut campaign more fondly once – and not if – his squad emerges on the other side, stronger and wiser for the suffering. Tottenham are 12th in the Premier League – their next game is at home to Sunderland on Sunday and Frank leant into a marathon-running analogy when he was asked whether he was enjoying the challenge to which he has signed up.Liam Rosenior opens door to Chelsea job but must wait on BlueCo dealingsRead more“When you need to put in a big, big shift and it’s not smooth and it’s tough, it’s probably difficult to enjoy it,” he said. “If I run hard I don’t enjoy that moment but I know I need to keep my head down and run hard to get through it. We are in a situation where you need to run hard, to stay in it. When we look back on this spell or maybe this first year when it was tough, you’ll think: ‘What a learning, what an experience, it made us so much better for the future.’“So the short answer is: no [he is not enjoying his job]. The reality is you can’t. But when I put myself out of it and look down, I think: ‘What a privilege to be in charge of this fantastic club in a period where it’s a big transition.’ It’s definitely a marathon and it definitely seems like it’s one of the more heavy miles I’m on now, but head down and keep going.”Frank repeated himself about the issues at the club, with injuries prominent among them, especially to attacking players. He has been deprived of Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison all season and Dominic Solanke for all but the first three games. Solanke has now returned to training. “When I walked in the door I didn’t expect Solanke and Maddison to be out for seven months, or for Kulusevski not to be ready,” he said.Frank’s comment about Kulusevski was interesting given it was reported on 21 August that the playerwould be out until around the turn of the year. In other words, he ought to be back about now, at least to training. Kulusevski is not yet in training. Xavi Simons will also miss the Sunderland game as he completes a three-match ban while Lucas Bergvall is an injury doubt.Tottenham’s travails at home in the league have been well-documented. Ditto the strain placed on the squad by their involvement in the Champions League. Ditto the unprecedented number of changes at executive level, the most notable being the departure of Daniel Levy. There is expected to be another one with the co-sporting director, Fabio Paratici, heavily linked with a move to Fiorentina. It raised a few eyebrows when the winger, Manor Solomon, cut short his loan at Villarreal this week to switch to Fiorentina, also on loan.View image in fullscreenFabio Paratici (left) in the stands with the Tottenham chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, at Crystal Palace on 28 December.Photograph: Javier García/ShutterstockFrank was asked who Paratici was working for. “Good question, maybe you know,” he said with a smile before re-joining the party line. “Fabio is Tottenham sporting director. I spoke to him twice yesterday. He is working very hard for Tottenham.”Frank knows endlessly listing the club’s problems is tedious. “This is where we are right now,” he insisted. “It’s unfortunately very boring but that’s the fact.” What Frank made clear was that this was a time for Spurs to hold their nerve – in terms of the overall situation and, more specifically, the January transfer window where the pressure for additions has been increased by the£35m sale of Brennan Johnson to Crystal Palace. Tottenham have also loaned defender Kota Takai, who joined them last summer for £5m from Kawasaki Frontale, to Borussia Mönchengladbach for the remainder of the season.Frank’s message is that only players who will help the club towards the long-term goal of challenging for silverware will be considered. He is not interested in buying himself time and credit with signings who would only provide a short-term boost. “We will do everything we can to improve the squad,” he said. “But short-term impact can’t limit long-term success. The flip-side is that if we can do something that will really improve us, we should go very hard for that.“We have lists of players in every position. Is No 6 [on the list] good enough for us to get to where we want to be in the future? Probably not. But it’s a fine balance.“Sometimes you need to take some steps forward before we can get the perfect solution.”Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FranknewsShareReuse this content"

The reality is that his job will come under serious threat should Celtic lose Saturday’s Old Firm fixture.The2-0 loss to Motherwellon Tuesday was the fifth reverse of his seven games in charge. The performance at Fir Park was especially dismal, which raised the latest set of questions about the former Columbus Crew coach’s suitability for his role. If Rangers win at Celtic Park they would draw level with their oldest foes despite their own unconvincing start to the campaign. Both trail Hearts in the Premiership.Scottish Premiership: Nancy’s Celtic slump to fifth defeat as Said inspires MotherwellRead more“This is only the beginning,” Nancy said. “Usually, we have four weeks of pre-season. I did not have pre-season. Before I came, I knew that if I don’t win games I am going to be in trouble because this is part of the job. But I am pleased to be here. I know where we are now. I am not an underdog.“In context, I knew this kind of situation could happen. I need time. Give me time and you will see my team. You are going to see what I am going to do because you can see already what I did before.“I didn’t start [in coaching] yesterday. If you do your job you will see the way I want to play, the way I defend, the way I want to attack; it is clear. It is totally normal that you guys, you kill me. I am fine with that. I am totally fine with that because I know where I want to go. Judge me in a few weeks, months.”A common criticism of Nancy has been the regular deployment of a three-man defence, for which Celtic are ill-suited. The club’s board face a dilemma this month over whether to spend significant money to help Nancy with his long-term aspirations or admit they have made an error in hiring him. AfterBrendan Rodgers left in October, Martin O’Neill led Celtic to seven wins out of eight while in caretaker charge.“Obviously people are not happy,” Nancy said. “I, too, am not happy. I see only a few glimpses of what we are trying to do, but I am pleased with that after only 12 or 13 [training] sessions.Wilfried Nancy’s Venn diagram and the optics of controlling the controllables | Max RushdenRead more“This is the context. It is a fact we have not had the results we wanted, I can not deny that. A few players have been here five, six, seven years and were doing things in a certain way. It takes time. If you do your job, you will see what I do. If you are going to be patient, you are going to see what I can do.“For the moment, this is a tornado. I knew that. Is it easy to handle that? No, but I am ready for that. Analyse all the games since I have been here, whether we should win or lose. Do it. For now, I shut my mouth and I take it, but I know where we are going.“This is not normal but it is expected; you do not win, you get killed. We are second, but because we lost a few games it is like we are last. I understand the context. I understand the narrative. I am not saying I accept it, but that is another debate.”The noise surrounding – and created by – Nancy is just one element of Celtic’s fraught position. Supporters are generally angry with the board, who had tosuspend their annual general meetingdue to unrest. Rodgers was astonishingly attacked by Dermot Desmond, the main shareholder, at the time of his exit, while Peter Lawwell, the Celtic chair, resigned last month, citing “threats and abuse”. This feels a club at constant odds with itself. A derby win would only briefly calm dissent.Nancy’s comments are likely to have raised eyebrows atRangers. Danny Röhl, their manager, had already spoken in upbeat terms about what will be his second taste of an Old Firm fixture.“We are ready,” he said. “We have a big confidence at the moment, we have a big belief.”Explore more on these topicsCelticRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

ButSudan, who qualified for the tournament despite the tragedy of a horrendous war in their country, certainly match the Lions of Teranga in fortitude. Sudan, coached by the Ghanaian Kwesi Appiah, who led his home country at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, played all their qualifiers away from home, with the war, which began in April 2023, shutting down a thriving domestic league. The Sudan striker John Mano told the BBC of people back home: “Some of them cannot watch the matches … They can’t even listen on the radio … We are trying to free our country, through the football way.” A win for Sudan would be one of the fairytales of the tournament.Mali v Tunisia, Sat 7pmThis is going to be one of the tastier games of the round, with Mali, coached by the Belgian Tom Saintfiet, having the depth of talent and presence of character to beat a Tunisian side who showed only glimpses of their potential in a dramatic 3-2 group defeat by Nigeria. Mali’s free-flowing football, attractive to the eye, is an ever-present danger to their opponents, and their players include Tottenham’s Yves Bissouma and the Auxerre striker Lassine Sinayoko, who leads the forward line. Tunisia, led by their 1998 World Cup player Sami Trabelsi, are yet to display the form that enabled them to qualify with relative ease for this summer’s World Cup. If they can rediscover their mojo, they could be a surprise team of the competition because they have the balance to thrive.Morocco v Tanzania, Sun 4pmThere could not have been an easier game for the host nation at this stage after a testy middle group game against Mali, which rattled the nerves of their manager, Walid Regragui, and thousands of Moroccans. The firepower of Brahim Díaz, the return of Achraf Hakimi and the goal-poaching talent of Ayoub El Kaabi, who has scored arguably the best goal of the competition so far, mean the game should be little more than an enhanced practice session for the Atlas Lions. Tanzania, building a team for the 2027 Afcon they are co-staging with Kenya and Uganda, made history by qualifying for the knockout stage for the first time in their 45-year tournament history.View image in fullscreenAyoub El Kaabi scores a spectacular goal for Morocco against Zambia.Photograph: ReutersSouth Africa v Cameroon, Sun 7pmHugo Broos, the South Africa coach, led Cameroon to their last Afcon triumph, in Gabon in 2017, so the Belgian is acutely aware of what his team will be up against. “We must learn to have concentration,” Broos said after Bafana-Bafana’s unconvincing 3-2 win over Zimbabwe in their final group match. “We can’t play like that against them [Cameroon]. If we do that, we have no chance to win.” Cameroon have held their own at the tournament despite sacking their Belgian coach Marc Brys on 1 December and replacing him with the 56-year-old Cameroonian David Pagou. The most successful sub-Saharan team, five times African champions, have pedigree and are led by Manchester United’s Bryan Mbeumo. But South Africa’s football under Broos, who leaves the job after the World Cup, has been on the ascendant, making what should ordinarily be Cameroon’s game very close to call.Egypt v Benin, Mon 4pmFor the Pharaohs, managed by the multiple Afcon winner Hossam Hassan and with players such as Omar Marmoush of Manchester City, Trézéguet and Mohamed Salah, this should be an easy day at the office. But it will be anything but that if Gernot Rohr, the manager of only the second Benin side to qualify for the knockout stages, has anything to do with it. “This is going to be a big game, a fantastic game for our country,” Rohr told the Guardian. “Of course, we know the big players they have … We know that it will be difficult to beat them. But as outsiders, we will have our chance.”Nigeria v Mozambique, Mon 7pmNigeria, three-time Afcon winners, earned their place in the last 16 in emphatic style, gaining maximum points against Tanzania, Tunisia and Uganda. With Victor Osimhen of Galatasaray, Ademola Lookman of Atalanta and Samuel Chukwueze of Fulham forming arguably Africa’s best strike force,Mozambiqueare, on paper, no match for them. Mozambique lost to Cameroon and Ivory Coast and went through as the best third-placed team, courtesy of a 3-2 shock win over Gabon. Nigeria’s head coach, Éric Chelle, is wary, however. “The group stages have ended and another tournament starts,” he said. “We just have a few days to be ready. For sure, this game would be tough.”View image in fullscreenNigeria’s Victor Osimhen is part of arguably Africa’s best strike force with Ademola Lookman and Samuel Chukwueze.Photograph: Ulrik Pedersen/NurPhoto/ShutterstockAlgeria v Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tues 4pmThis will be a battle of tactical minds: Vladimir Petkovic on the Algerian side and Sébastien Desabre on the Congolese side. Their ability to exploit the holes in their opponents, to pay attention to the small details in what is likely to be an extremely tight game, could prove decisive. Both teams, with talented players such as Riyad Mahrez and Fiston Mayele respectively, play with verve and daring adventure. Their passionate fans will also bring colour to what should be a spectacle.Côte d’Ivoire v Burkina Faso, Tues 7pmThis game between neighbouring west African countries, whose people share language and cultural similarities, could go either way, even though Côte d’Ivoire are the defending champions andBurkina Fasohad not made an Afcon finals in 12 years. The Côte d’Ivoire manager, Emerse Faé, has not retained the confidence of his compatriots since unexpectedly winning the tournament in Februay 2024 and is determined to prove that triumph was not the fluke most in the African football community believe it was. It took a near defeat against Gabon, in their final group game, to shake his players out of complacency. Burkina Faso have started strongly, a dramatic win over Equatorial Guinea and a victory against Sudan sandwiching the controversial loss to Algeria that put them second in their group. Brama Traoré, the head coach of the Stallions, will be relying on the defensive stalwart Edmund Tapsoba, of Bayer Leverkusen, and the attacking talent of Bertrand Traoré, Dango Ouattara and Pierre Landry Kaboré.Explore more on these topicsAfrica Cup of Nations 2025Africa Cup of NationsSenegal football teamSudanMali football teamTunisia football teamMorocco football teamanalysisShareReuse this content"

Glasner has made no secret of his desire to bolster the FA Cup winners after a demanding debut campaign in Europe and has criticised Palace’s lack of preparedness in previous transfer windows. However, the Austrian manager said he was delighted with the signing of the 24-year-old after Palace saw off competition from Bournemouth.“He arrives very early in the window, so credit to the club for making this happen so quickly,” said Glasner. “Brennan will give us options in our attacking play with his pace and goalscoring ability and with all the upcoming games he will be a valuable addition to the squad.”Quick GuidePlay our new game: On the ballShowThe Guardian has kicked off a new chapter in puzzles withthe launch of its first daily football game, On the ball. It is now live in the app for both iOS and Android … so what are you waiting for? Get stuck in!Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Palace have been tracking the former Nottingham Forest forward for some time and agreed a deal with Spurs on Tuesday that surpasses the fee paid to buy Christian Benteke from Liverpool in August 2016. It is understood Johnson, who has struggled for game time at Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season and started only six times in thePremier League, was keen to stay in London.Johnson, who scored the goal thatwon Spurs the Europa Leaguelast May, said: “Crystal Palace are such a great club, one that I’ve always admired. It’s a great time for me to be here and join the journey that this club is on – I’m super-excited.”His departure means Spurs have sold their leading scorers from the past three seasons, Johnson following Son Heung-min and Harry Kane in leaving. Tottenham are expected to bring in a replacement in January, with Manchester City’s Savinho and Yan Diomande of RB Leipzig believed to be among their targets.Palace hope to strengthen their squad further and have held talks with Angers over the 19-year-old forward Sidiki Chérif, although they face stiff competition from Paris FC. Glasner would also like more cover at right-back despite Daniel Muñoz getting closer to his return from a knee injury and Genk’s Zakaria El Ouahdi and Vanderson of Monaco have been linked. Palace are also in the market for midfield reinforcements and have targeted an ambitious move for Kees Smit of AZ, who is wanted by Newcastle and Real Madrid.Brightonhave confirmed the return of their former captain Pascal Gross on a contract until the end of next season after the 34-year-old left to joinBorussia Dortmundin August 2024. “He’s a fantastic player and someone I know well and was looking forward to working with when I first came to the club,” said the head coach, Fabian Hürzeler. “Brighton fans know his attributes, but he brings great leadership qualities to the group.

West Ham considereda move for the Wolves striker Jørgen Strand Larsenbut decided against making a bid after concluding that his £40m valuation was too high.They instead moved quickly toagree a deal for Pablo, who joins for £18.3m plus £2.6m in add-ons. After being unveiled as the Hammers’ new No 19, he said in a statement: “I want to send a strong message that I have come to prove my worth. I know I am a young player, but I know that at this club you have to give your all, and we have to give our best for the club and for our teammates.”West Ham also swiftly concluded negotiations with Lazio over a £26.1m deal for Castellanos. West Ham are also looking to complete a short-term deal for the Fulham winger Adama Traoré, who is out of contract at the end of the season, but have failed with a loan bid for Chelsea’s Raheem Sterling. Fulham are favourites to land Sterling, who does not believe that a temporary move to West Ham would help him revive his career.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Nuno’s side are 18th and short of strikers.Niclas Füllkrug has joined Milanon loan, leaving Callum Wilson as the only senior natural forward. West Ham believe Pablo has vast potential. The 21-year-old has helped Gil Vicente to fourth place in the Primeira Liga by scoring nine goals. There are, however, concerns over whether the Brazilian, who is expected to acquire Portuguese citizenship soon, will be able to carry his success in Portugal’s top flight to England. Pablo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, represents Nuno.West Ham also considered moves for Viktoria Plzen’s Rafiu Durosinmi, Crystal Palace’s Eddie Nketiah and Coventry’s Haji Wright and Ellis Simms. They spent New Year’s Day in talks over Castellanos, who has scored two goals in 12 games for Lazio this season. The 27-year-old, who joined Lazio from New York City in 2023, is more of a deep-lying forward. He has been pushed by Nuno.A centre-back is also a priority for West Ham, who retain an interest in the Toulouse defender Charlie Cresswell. They are selling the Brazilian winger Luis Guilherme to Sporting for £14.8m. The 19-year-old has made little impact since joining from Palmeiras in 2024. James Ward-Prowse, George Earthy, Callum Marshall and Guido Rodríguez are other possible departures.Explore more on these topicsWest Ham UnitedTransfer windowLazioEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

Plus: Semenyo set to play for Bournemouth despite transfer talk, and Toone extends dealJamie Jackson,Tom Garryand PA MediaFri 2 Jan 2026 14.22 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 15.45 ESTShare1.‘It’s a game in a hostile environment’Ruben Amorim has told the Manchester United teenagers Jack Fletcher, Shay Lace and Bendito Mantato that they need to be ready for Sunday’s hostile environment at Leeds United.Amorim has been forced into giving all three their debuts as substitutes in recent games because of a depleted squad. The head coach again expects to be without eight frontline players for the weekend visit to Elland Road. Bruno Fernandes, Harry Maguire, Kobbie Mainoo, Matthijs de Ligt, and Mason Mount are all injured, while Noussair Mazraoui, Bryan Mbeumbo and Amad Diallo are away on Africa Cup of Nations duty.Fletcher, 18, has appeared in United’s last three games – the 2-1 loss at Aston Villa, a 1-0 win over Newcastle and Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Wolves. Lacey, who is also 18, featured against Villa, while Mantato, 17, played against Wolves. Amorim was asked if he feels the trio can handle playing away to one of United’s fiercest rivals. “They have to,” he said. “It’s a game in a hostile environment, but they need to be ready and they need to experience that. But it’s going to be hard for any player. Even the guys with a lot of experience, but again, we already experienced that. [Athletic] Bilbao last year was amazing, the sound.“You can see the squad – it’s impossible, we cannot stretch the players. Of course I will try to put a team that is ready to cope with that [the Elland Road atmosphere] and then I will try to read the game and try to understand what I should do to help them to win the game.United had targeted Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo but the wide forward is set to join Manchester City instead. Amorim suggested he may not now strengthen the squad. “The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversation at this moment to have any change in the squad,” said the 40-year-old. “There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue. We are near the places of the Champions League but we are near to like eight teams behind us. So let’s focus on the next game, just that.”Amorim was asked if any player had asked to leave during this window. “None of them,” he insisted. “I don’t expect them to come to me to ask anything.”Jamie Jackson2.Semenyo ready to play against ArsenalThe Bournemouth manager, Andoni Iraola, said Antoine Semenyo would face Arsenal, the leaders, on Saturday, amid continuing talks over a transfer to Manchester City.Second-placed City have reportedly agreed to meet Semenyo’s £65m release clause. Iraola said nothing has been signed and believes the 25-year-old Ghana international may remain at the Vitality Stadium long enough to also feature against Tottenham on Wednesday.“Yes, Antoine is going to play in this match,” Iraola said of Arsenal’s visit. “I think the idea at least that he’s going to be available in these two home games in a short turnaround. I hope he can be here for more time. But I don’t know what’s going to be happen.”Of the move to City he added: “There is nothing signed. There are conversations, I understand the noise around [him] but Antoine is our player. I hope to keep him for a lot of time.”Bournemouth’s top scorer, who is poised to make his 100th Premier League appearance, has registered nine goals and three assists in 18 top-flight outings this term. “He’s playing very well,” said Iraola, whose side have gone 10 games without a win with Tuesday’s 2-2 draw at Chelsea. “He’s doing the right things, a top professional and top guy. He wants to help the team, I have no doubts that he will do his best.”PA MediaView image in fullscreenAntoine Semenyo is set to feature for Bournemouth on Saturday at home to Arsenal and could yet face Tottenham on Wednesday.Photograph: Robin Jones/AFC Bournemouth/Getty Images3.Emery: no permanent Villa move for ElliottUnai Emery has revealed he decided not to sign Harvey Elliott permanently two months ago. Elliott joined Aston Villa from Liverpool on transfer deadline day on a season-long loan, with an obligation to buy that was conditional on appearances.The 22-year-old winger has made only five appearances for Villa, with Emery now opting not to play him and trigger the permanent deal option. “The problem we have with Harvey is that this year he is on loan, and in case he plays matches we must buy him,” Emery said.“We decided two months ago that we are not convinced to sign him, spending the money we would need to sign him. This is the only issue. He is training every day, always every day with very good behaviour and to help us in training sessions.“This is not something good for him and good for us, but this is football and sometimes we must take some decisions which are not good for everyone.”PA Media4.Le Bris hails Sunderland’s home fortressRégis Le Bris believes Sunderland’s home draws against the Premier League title contenders Arsenal and Manchester City have proved they can be competitive at this level.The Black Cats earned another valuable point with a goalless draw against City on New Year’s Day, extending their unbeaten home record. That run includes a 2-2 draw with Arsenal, the leaders, in November, and Sunderland are seventh at the halfway stage of their first campaign back in the top tier.“It’s really positive for the club, for the squad, for the lads because we are playing against the best in Europe and we showed it’s possible to be competitive,” Le Bris said. “It’s good for the confidence, it’s good for the collective and individual projects. At the same time we know that we need to reset quickly because this league is relentless.”Le Bris added: “I think it’s important to show it’s a tough place here because we are really well connected with fans. They feed our defensive energy. This connection is really positive.”PA MediaView image in fullscreenRégis Le Bris has praised Sunderland fans for their role in the team’s unbeaten home record.Photograph: Connor McMain/Every Second Media/Shutterstock5.Wolves ready to be busy in transfer windowRob Edwards has said Wolves will do “a lot of work” in the transfer market this month in a bid to revive their desperate season. Wolves picked up their third point of the campaign with a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Tuesday but are still winless this season.Edwards’ side are 15 points adrift of the last safe spot and will need to bring in reinforcements if they are to somehow pull off a miraculous escape from relegation. Wolves also need to make decisions on whether to keep hold of star players such as the striker Jørgen Strand Larsen.“There’s conversations I’m involved in, there will be conversations I’m not involved in, but when I need to know something I can get involved,” Edwards said. “There will be a lot of work going on behind the scenes on both incomings and outgoings.”On Strand Larsen, Edwards added: “His attitude has been brilliant. He is working extremely hard and there is no concerns about that. Because of the position we’re in, we have some good players so there is going to be speculation.”PA Media6.Maestre to lead London City LionessesLondon City Lionesses have appointed the Spaniard Eder Maestre as their head coach, on a contract until 2028. The 39-year-old former CD Tenerife manager replaces Jocelyn Prêcheur, who was sacked in December despite guiding the team to promotion last term and into the top half of the Women’s Super League table this season. Maestre’s first game will be 11 January’s trip to face the bottom side, Liverpool. He said: “I am delighted to join London City Lionesses. Working in English football has always been my goal, and representing this club is a real honour. In my opinion, the project presented to me by the club is one of the best projects in women’s football.”Tom Garry7.Toone extends contract at Manchester UnitedView image in fullscreenElla Toone extends her contract at Old Trafford until 2027.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAManchester United have this week exercised options in the contracts of Ella Toone, Elizabeth Terland, Lisa Naalsund and Gabby George to extend their time at the club until 2027, the Guardian understands. All four players had been set to enter the final six months of their deals but the WSL club have moved during this winter break to extend their stays for at least another season.The England midfielder Toone who is – like George – a lifelong United fan, has been at the club for seven and a half years, as a mainstay since they reformed a senior women’s side in 2018. The Norway striker Terland has been at Carrington for two years, while her compatriot Naalsund joined the club in 2023, helping the club reach three consecutive FA Cup finals.Tom GarryExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

Five representatives of West Midlands police were also present.According to the document, the force told the group it had “significant intelligence indicating potential for disorder” involvingMaccabi Tel Avivfans “based on recent fixtures”, citing incidents in Italy, Norway and Amsterdam.“Other sports, eg baseball in Holland, have also seen disorder when Israeli teams were involved,” police said according to the minutes.“These incidents suggest that Maccabi Tel Aviv’s presence could attract protest and disorder, even outside the football context.”Police also said that there was a “high likelihood of protest activity linked to the fixture whether aimed at MTA [Maccabi Tel Aviv] supporters or MTA themselves. This sits at the highest threat,” according to the document.However, the force also acknowledged the risk level of the match remained at “medium” without away fans due to community tensions and the potential for spontaneous protest.The decision to introduce the ban, which was not objected to by any members of the group, was made on the rationale that there was a “high risk associated with the presence of Maccabi Tel Aviv fans” and that “community tensions could be exacerbated”.The head of West Midlands police has been recalled to parliament next Tuesday by the Home Affairs Committee, which is scrutinising the decision to ban away fans.Ahead of the hearing,further details have been providedby chief constable Craig Guildford from West Midlands police about the intelligence that led to the ban – including notes of an email summarising a meeting between the head of WMP’s football unit and Dutch police.The email notes “violent confrontations” that took place before a match between Ajax and Maccabi Aviv in Amsterdam in 2024, including alleged incidents of Muslim taxi drivers being pulled from vehicles and the singing of anti-Muslim and anti-Gaza chants.On the day of the fixture, there was a ”national mobilisation of Muslim youths” travelling to Amsterdam “to seek retribution” – the notes state – with reported hit-and-run incidents on Maccabi fans.The government’s independent adviser on antisemitism, Lord Mann, had previously described a number of the claims made by West Midlands police as “inaccurate” and said the force had “conflated different things”.The Times reported thatDutch police were “surprised” by claimsattributed to them by the WMP force.The leader of Birmingham city council, John Cotton, and other council bosses are due to be quizzed by MPs next week.In a letter to the chair of the Home Affairs Committee in December, Birmingham city council’s executive director of city operations said there would be an independent review to “ascertain what can be improved from a governance perspective”.West Midlands police were approached but declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsAntisemitismMaccabi Tel AvivBirminghamAston VillaFreedom of informationnewsShareReuse this content"

I used to find it tough when I was a bit younger. I like directness so I used to be direct too.”When Carter spoke out during the Euros about racist abuse aimed at her on social media it wasn’t calculated. She had tried to bury her voice, again, to “stay in the bubble”. Except the bubble had been pierced.Carter was first targeted when she had a tough time in England’s opening game,a 2-1 defeat by France. She, like every Lioness, struggled. Shortly after the game, Carter was sitting with her family and was in her Instagram direct messages. Usually she doesn’t look at her DMs and deletes them unread unless they are from someone she knows, “because I’m a little neat freak and I hate seeing the notifications”. But one caught her attention and she clicked. “Oh, that’s a bit much,” she thought. Then she saw others, also racist, that hit harder. She deleted them and tried to move on.View image in fullscreenJess Carter and the rest of the England team struggled in the first game of their European title defence against France.Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Getty ImagesHow did they make her feel? “It just really devalues you,” she says. “It makes you question everything about yourself, who I am. Just my skin colour?“When we’re younger we’re taught to get on with it, that there’s always going to be people like that and you just have to ignore it, but at that time I was not feeling very confident in myself in terms of my football. Where normally I don’t care what people have got to say about me, I think having that lack of confidence and then getting the abuse meant the impact was totally different.“A lot of people don’t like the way I play football and that’s absolutely fine, but then attacking someone because of what they look like? I can’t do anything about that one, and I wouldn’t want to. I could never imagine going on to my social media to tell you how I think you’re doing at your job.”Carter could not push it away; it was too deeply in her head. “It gave me a lot of anxiety throughout the tournament and I’d never had that happen before – I’m not an anxious person,” the 28-year-old says. “Having that on top of the lack of confidence was really tough. It made me very anxious when I was on the pitch. I was thinking: ‘God, if I mess up or this happens, what will happen?’View image in fullscreen‘Having that lack of confidence and then getting the abuse meant the impact was totally different.’ Jess Carter received racist abuse in her Instagram DMs after England’s opening defeat.Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian“I remember not wanting to go out at all in between games. I did, because my partner [the Germany goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger] was like: ‘Just go out, you can’t hide away.’ But I didn’t want to. I saw the potential for someone to be abusive in everyone.”AfterEngland’s win against the Netherlandsin their second game she stayed away from her socials, but she saw after the6-1 defeat of Walesfour days that there was more racist abuse. Thepenalty shootout victory over Swedenin the next match was when the switch flipped.“I contributed to the two goals we conceded – that’s how I saw it anyway. After we’d won the game, I was sitting in the stands with my family and I went to go and get up one of the goals on Instagram, to see it again, because sometimes when you’re in that moment it’s a bit of a blur. I opened up my Instagram and there’s more messages, a lot of them. My sister saw my face and asked what had happened. I said: ‘Oh, it doesn’t matter, it’s fine.’ She went into protective sister mode, so I showed her.”This time Carter didn’t delete them, and at the team hotel she asked England’s social media team how to block and report people on Instagram. She also logged on to X for the first time in a long time to do the same. The Football Association asked whether there was anything further it could do but she said she would just report and it would be fine.The following day her sister encouraged her to speak out, but Carter was resistant. “One, nothing gets done about it. Two, we already have so much scrutiny as England players. I’m already under so much scrutiny; we didn’t need any more media attention.“I just wanted to try to protect the bubble we were in and to block out that outside noise as much as I could. Then, my sister was like: ‘If that was LJ or Khiara or Mich [Lauren James, Khiara Keating or Michelle Agyemang], what would you want them to do? How would you want to support them?’“I was the oldest player of colour there, I felt a sense of responsibility with them, to try to help and be there for them if need be. I’ve got mixed-race nieces and nephews and my sister said: ‘What would you say to them?’”View image in fullscreenJess Carter was encouraged to speak publicly after her sister asked her what she would do if Lauren James, Michelle Agyemang and Khiara Keating received similar racist abuse.Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Getty ImagesCarter went back to the FA and said she was going to post something saying she was coming off social media. Then she spoke with the leadership team, some senior players and the head coach, Sarina Wiegman, and explained what had been happening. “The other players of colour came in too, because we’d spoken briefly for some time about how we felt like taking the knee was irrelevant now and that it had lost its value,” Carter says. “We felt quite strongly about that. I explained what had happened. Obviously, everyone was really gutted and down about it and straight away they were like: ‘Absolutely, we will write a message, the whole team will do something, together as England.’”The collective message condemned the “online poison” aimed at Carter and revealed the squad would stop taking a knee. Carter’s Instagram message said she was stepping back from social media and that it was not acceptable “to target someone’s appearance or race”. After a police investigation a man is due in court on 9 January, summonsed over social media messages sent to Carter. The players intended to stand in solidarity before the semi-final against Italy but that did not go to plan.“The idea was that the ref would blow the whistle for taking the knee and then we wouldn’t, so there’d be that pause where people would wonder what’s going on. It didn’t happen that way. The ref just blew the whistle and the game kicked off, so our standing didn’t really make the statement we hoped it would.”The impact of sharing what she had been going through with the team was significant. “The moment I’d spoken to them I just felt like a massive weight was lifted off my shoulders. I knew I wasn’t alone. I’ve always had an incredible support system, but I had felt incredibly isolated from that France game onwards. Just having my teammates be there mattered.”Carter was dropped for the semi-final. “I was actually instantly relieved,” she says. “I said to Ann it was the first time I’ve ever been glad I’m not playing. The training afterwards, when I was acting as Italy and preparing the starters, was the most stress-free I’d trained and played that whole tournament and it was the nicest feeling. That’s how I know what an impact the abuse had on me.”Carter says her “amazing” relationship with Wiegman helped. “I’ve always found it so easy to have really honest, private conversations with her. We trained and then she sat me down and said: ‘Look, I’m thinking of not playing you in the game. It’s purely a tactical decision. I think that the game will present itself in a way that will better suit Esme [Morgan].’ And I was like: ‘That’s absolutely fine.’ I truly believe when you’ve got a good manager, decisions should be tactical and with Sarina I don’t need an explanation because I trust that her decisions are purely that.”View image in fullscreen‘I’ve always found it so easy to have really honest, private conversations with her.’ Jess Carter is embraced by Sarina Wiegman after victory in the Euro 2025 final.Photograph: Maja Hitij/Uefa/Getty ImagesCarter came on in added time of extra time and it felt like a huge vote of confidence. “She could have put someone else on but she didn’t.”Despite a tournament fraught with struggle on and off the pitch, Carter was told she would start the final against Spain. She hadn’t seen it coming. “I was well aware that I’d had inconsistent moments and Esme, I felt, didn’t put a foot wrong against Italy,” she says. Her assessment of her own form? “I made quite a few errors that I don’t normally make. It was a tournament where I felt like I’d underperformed.”Carter barely slept the night before the final. It was the first time she had experienced “sheer panic, stress and anxiety” before a game. “I wasn’t equipped with the tools to manage it, because I’ve never needed to,” she says. The defender, though, has a pragmatic approach to her work. “Football is not my everything like it is for other people,” she says. “I do football because I love it and if, at times, I don’t love it then I remind myself that it’s my job.”For the final she had to channel that: “If we win we’re going home, if we lose we’re going home. It didn’t matter. So, it was just: go out, do your thing, and then it’s over.”View image in fullscreenJess Carter struggled to sleep the night before the final against Spain, experiencing ‘sheer panic, stress and anxiety’ for the first time ahead of a match.Photograph: Alexander Hassenstein/Getty ImagesAt the end of the penalty shootout,a second Euros trophy secured, the overwhelming feeling was relief. “I’m not a huge celebrator. It’s not because I’m not excited, but I just had a huge feeling of relief. I feel like maybe when I’m overwhelmed with something I don’t celebrate loudly.”Carter skipped the celebrations on the Mall and went back to the US to link up with Gotham FC, the team she joined a year earlier after leaving Chelsea, as they vied for a playoff place. Carter, who has US citizenship through her father, says ofher Chelsea exit: “I wasn’t happy there any more. It had been like that for a couple of seasons. The things that I valued the most for myself and for my team weren’t there from my perspective any more. Of course, we were still winning and it was great, but I care more about how I feel and my happiness than I do about winning a game of football or a title.”View image in fullscreenA few months after her second Euro win, Jess Carter helped Gotham FC become NWSL champions for the second time in their history.Photograph: Eakin Howard/NWSL/Getty ImagesCarter got a mixed response when she told ITN she experienced“almost like a sigh of relief”when Beth Mead and Grace Clinton – white players – joined James in missing penalties against Sweden. “For me, there’s been clear examples of black players representing England where black players make the same mistake as white players but black players get scrutinised for it more,” she says now.“It is a real thing and the fact that players of colour step up to the penalty spot and have to think about anything else other than scoring a penalty is wild to me. Having to try to find a way to filter out the fact that whatever happens you’re going to get scrutinised so much, not just for playing poorly or missing a penalty, but because of the colour of your skin. That’s so much more added pressure.”Explore more on these topicsFootballWomen's footballGuardian Footballer of the YearUS sportsEngland women's football teaminterviewsShareReuse this content"

Arteta’s side have an opportunity to build on their lead when they travel to Bournemouth on Saturday evening, with City facing Chelsea 24 hours later, but look likely to be without Declan Rice again owing to a knee injury.Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City players to get ‘heads up’ for visit of ChelseaRead moreArsenal werelast champions in 2004, when their Invincibles started the year trailing Manchester United. They have since started 2008, 2014, 2016, 2022 and 2023 top without still being there come late May. Arteta was not aware of that but insisted he senses after the stirring win4-1 over Aston Villato end 2025 that his players are ready to make history.“Let’s break it,” he said. “I think that’s what they transmit every single day when they’re with us, [in] training and every match. You can see their desire. You can see the energy that they put in, how much they want it. And that’s what we need. There’s still five months to go. And take it day by day. Enjoy that process of being where we are and go for it.”Arteta also said Arsenal’s players must embrace the pressure of a title race despite finishing as runners-up for three successive seasons.Asked whether there was anything they could do differently, he said: “Win more games, that’s it. So I think from January to January, we won more points again in the last three years than any other team in this league. So we need more points, that’s it. We need to win more games and be better. That’s the only way. It’s a privilege to be here and be where we are.”Arsenal had been hopeful that the swelling in Rice’s injured knee would subside for him to feature against Bournemouth and will assess him further. Arteta rejected a suggestion that the injury could have been avoided if the England midfielder had been substituted when he picked up the injury in thewin over Brightonlast week.“No, no, no,” he said. “He managed to do it. That’s normal sometimes. You get a hit, and throughout the game you are able with adrenaline, and because you are warm, you are able to sustain that. And then the body reacts, and it reacted probably more than we expected, unfortunately.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

The main obstacle to be overcome is that BlueCo, the investment vehicle that owns Chelsea and Strasbourg, is keen to be sensitive to the needs of both clubs. A quality replacement for Rosenior at Strasbourg must be lined up before the Englishman can leave the Ligue 1 side.Young, articulate, ambitious: why Liam Rosenior is in the frame to be Chelsea’s next manager | Michael ButlerRead moreIt means that Calum McFarlane, Chelsea’s Under-21s coach, will be in interim charge at Manchester City on Sunday. Rosenior will be in the Strasbourg dugout when they face Nice on Saturday evening and there are no guarantees he will be installed for Chelsea’s trip to Fulham on Wednesday. Yet the former Brighton defender acknowledged the situation could develop quickly when challenged on Friday over whether he envisages staying at Strasbourg.“There are no guarantees in life,” Rosenior said. “What I do know is that I put everything into this job. I’ve created some unbelievable connections with the people at this club. We’ve created some really great memories. You can’t guarantee anything in life. In terms of interest for other clubs, I’ve had a lot of interest.“A lot of approaches that I’ve always been open with the club about. Some have come out and some haven’t. My focus is always on the job that I do. But to say I’m definitely going to be somewhere or definitely going to do something, I don’t think that’s right.”Rosenior is understood to have rebuffed offers from Premier League sides and Bayer Leverkusen during his time at Strasbourg, who are seventh in Ligue 1 and one of the favourites to win the Conference League. He has longstanding relationships with three of Chelsea’s five sporting directors. Chelsea like that Rosenior has a similar tactical profile to Maresca.“They have been so supportive of me in this job,” Rosenior said of BlueCo’s leadership team. “They want this club to do so well, as they also want Chelsea to do well as well.”The expectation is that Rosenior will end up at Chelsea, who viewed him as the long-term successor to Maresca long before the Italian’s tenure turned sour. However Chelsea have alternative plans in place. They have looked at Porto’s Francesco Farioli and have at least one other iron in the fire.For now they are being led by McFarlane, who was surprised when he was asked to step in for Maresca on Wednesday. “I was actually on the way to a Windsor light show with my family,” he said. “I got a call and I said I can be in in an hour. The missus wasn’t very happy about that.”Explore more on these topicsChelseaStrasbourgnewsShareReuse this content"

The move means drivers make a contract directly with their passengers – so they must charge any VAT due on the fare, while Uber only adds VAT to its commission.As most drivers are not thought to be making more than £90,000 in bookings a year, and therefore do not have to charge VAT, the majority of Uber fares outside London will avoid becoming more expensive, since the 20% sales tax will not apply.The new contracts do not relate to London, where the agency model is not allowed under Transport for London rules. As a result, Uber passengers in the capital will pay VAT on their fares.Uber’s change to the terms with its drivers has been expected since the budget announcement.At the time, Andrew Brem, Uber’s regional general manager for the UK,said: “The government’s action today to change the rules will mean higher prices for passengers in London, and less work for drivers, when people are already struggling with the cost of living … This decision also establishes the absurd situation where a trip in London will be taxed at a different rate than a trip anywhere else in the UK.”An HM Treasury spokesperson said: “Ending this use of a niche tax scheme by online minicab firms will both benefit everyday cabbies with a fairer tax system and raise money to help deliver the country’s priorities – cutting the cost of living, cutting waiting lists, and cutting debt and borrowing.”It did not say if Uber’s changes would affect its estimate of “protecting” £700m a year of receipts from the new policy.Explore more on these topicsUberTax and spendingPublic financenewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s ban on international NGOs will worsen this disasterFri 2 Jan 2026 13.07 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 13.15 ESTShareAsGazaenters the bleakest period of winter, children are dying of hypothermia,drowning in flooded campsandburning to deathas their families try to cook in flimsy tents. Israel destroyed nine out of 10 homes over more than two years of war. Camped amid the ruins, Palestinians struggle againststrong winds, heavy rain and freezing temperatures. Aid deliveries resumed following the ceasefire, staving off the famine that had taken hold in parts of the territory, but remain wholly insufficient: 1.6 million people face acute food insecurity. The sanitation infrastructure has collapsed.The UK, Canada, Japan, France and six other nations havejointly warnedthat the situation is catastrophic. Yet Israel is now deepening one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. On Tuesday, it announced that it is deregistering37 NGOs active in Gaza. They must cease all operations there by 1 March unless they meet its new “security and transparency standards” – including by disclosing the personal details of staff. Many of the listed groups are among the best-regarded in their field, including Oxfam, Médecins Sans Frontières and the Norwegian Refugee Council.Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, was right to describe this as outrageous – and as part of a pattern of unlawful restrictions on humanitarian access. Israeli NGOs havewarnedthat it breaks the principles of independence and neutrality for humanitarian organisations.Israel says that the measures are necessary to prevent NGOs employing staff with links to extremist groups. It has repeatedly claimed that Hamas has infiltrated aid organisations and exploited international aid, while providing little evidence. Given the many relief workers arbitrarily detained and killed since the war began, the demand for staff lists has prompted alarm.Israelhas reportedly refused requests for meetings on the issue.Meanwhile, as Israel bars life-saving supplies such as tent poles and generators from humanitarian shipments, claiming they could be exploited for military purposes, itallows tradersto bring such items into the territory. While ordinary Palestinians suffer, players inside and outside the territory profit financially and politically. US officers in Israel have reportedly urged that key items, including tent poles, be removed from the blacklist – without success.In Washington, there appears to begrowing frustrationat Benjamin Netanyahu’s attempts to stall the peace process. Yet while Donald Trump said he wanted to move to the second phase as quickly as possible when he met the Israeli prime minister on Monday – and warned there would be “hell to pay” if Hamas did not disarm very rapidly – he appeared relaxed about Israel’s reluctance to withdraw from the half of Gaza that it controls.Far from “[living] up to the plan, 100%”, as Mr Trump claimed, it is clear that Israel is not complying with a deal that Palestinians greeted with tentative relief only as the alternative to continued war. If he wants to be lauded as a dealmaker, he should enforce it. Ensuring relief to those in desperate conditions is not an act of munificence subject to inclination, nor a clause for negotiation. It is not merely what basic humanity and decency require;international law demandsthat the parties to conflict facilitate aid. Israel’s allies were slowly pushed into acknowledging and challenging the carnage in Gaza. They must not drag their feet again. It is not bad weather but bad faith that is the greatest threat to those now struggling to survive.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Think of it instead as a hope or even a plea for the next 12 months. May the coming year see those leaders who have done so much damage to their own countries, and far beyond, at last be called to account. Let 2026 be a year of reckoning.Start with the man whose reach is longest, by dint of the mighty power he wields. Such is the nature of the US electoral system thatDonald Trump, who returned to power less than a year ago, will face the judgment of voters in 10 months’ time. His name will not be on the ballot but, make no mistake, the midterm elections of 3 November will deliver a verdict on the second Trump presidency.A slew of congressional defeats for his party would be satisfying in itself, wounding that gargantuan ego of his, but it would also have practical significance. Few predict the Republicans losing control of the Senate, where Democrats would have to flip at least four seats to take charge – near-impossible giventhe geography of the 35 seatsup for grabs in November. But, in normal circumstances, it should be the safest of political bets that the House of Representatives will no longer be in Republican hands a year from now.Such a reverse would dispel the aura of indomitability that has enveloped Trump since he beat Kamala Harris, allowing him to bully and intimidate multiple US institutions, includingmuch of its media, into ceding to him far more power than is rightfully his. It would render him a lame duck, incapable of passing new laws through a hostile chamber.Above all, it would see Trump confronted at last with a body both eager and able to hold him to account: a Democratic House would have the appetite and the muscle for serious scrutiny. Armed with subpoena power, it could investigate everything fromthe cost of Trump’s tariffsfor US taxpayersto the astonishingly brazen pattern ofcorruption and pocket-liningthat has characterised this administration. And up its sleeve would be the constant threat of a third impeachment trial.So November could indeed bring a reckoning for Trump, which is why he will stop at nothing to avert that outcome. Hence the words of caution above: “in normal circumstances”. Trump will make the circumstances abnormal, if that’s what it takes to keep the House.That effort is already under way, whether in the form of gerrymandered maps in Texas or moves to make voting harder in Democratic areas across the country.There are heartening signs of institutions beginning to push back – witnesslast week’s supreme court decisionreining in Trump’s deployment of US troops on the streets of Democrat-led cities – but this willbe one of the battles of 2026, as the president stretches every sinew to avoid the accountability an autumn defeat would bring.In that, he has a soul brother inthe man he hosted in Mar-a-Lagothis week, in what was their sixth and final meeting of 2025: Benjamin Netanyahu. Except the electoral peril confronting Netanyahu, whose first term as Israel’s prime minister began in 1996, is more direct: at some point between now and October, Israelis will go to the polls in a contest that could remove him from power altogether.Central will be the holding of Netanyahu to account. Many around the world will want that to be for the killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, for the relentless aerial bombardment that has left the strip in ruins and for the withholding of humanitarian aid. But insideIsrael, the accountability that is sought most keenly is for the deadly failures of 7 October 2023, for the complacency and strategic errors that left a string of southern communities, and hundreds of people at a music festival, exposed to murderous Hamas attack.Israeli officials at every level, civilian and military, have paid for that catastrophe with their jobs – bar one. Only Netanyahu has never admitted the slightest responsibility, let alone apologised, for the fact that the deadliest day in the country’s history came on his watch. He has refused to establish a commission of inquiry like those that swiftly followed previous calamities, preferring instead a sham investigation staffed by loyalists – equivalent,as the father of one slain hostage put it, to asking the iceberg to find out who sank the Titanic. So the only chance Israelis will have to hold to account the man who has ruled them for 18 of the past 30 years will be at the ballot box.The stakes could hardly be higher. Plenty of Israeli campaigners fear this election might be the last chance to save key democratic institutions that have been under sustained assault from Netanyahu for so long. Like Trump in the US or Viktor Orbán in Hungary, who also faces voters this year, Netanyahu has been in an escalating war with the judiciary and independent media, squeezing them ever harder, hoping they will choke. And, like his pal in Washington, Netanyahu will stop at nothing to deny his opponents an electoral victory: on trial on corruption charges, he needs to stay in power in order to stay out of jail. Accountability of both the political and legal varieties terrifies him.And he is not the only leader in the region fearful of the anger of his own people. Iranians have tried and tried again to vent their fury at the regime that has ruled their country for 47 years, only to be suppressed, often brutally.Protests have erupted once againin recent days, the authorities resorting to lethal force even more rapidly than in the past – though there are encouraging signs that some in the security forces are reluctant to engage in the usual crackdown. For years, many inside Iran have despaired at a regime bent on becoming a regional power by sponsoring terror and mayhem in the Middle East and beyond, with ordinary Iranians paying the price in sanctions and economic pain. The reckoning for that has been postponed, more than once. But the demand for change is loud and,says the scholar of Iran Ali Ansari, “Sooner or later something will have to give.”In the streets or at the ballot box, accountability could be coming in 2026. In Britain, the Labour government has good reason to fear it, bracing for big losses in every direction, whether to Plaid Cymru in Wales, the Scottish National party in Scotland, the Greens especially in London or Reform UK almost everywhere. In a just world, Nigel Farage would fear the voters, anxious that they would hold him to account not only forhis squalid pastbut as the man who served as chief evangelist for the most disastrous national decision since Munich, namely the Brexit referendum, which marks its 10th anniversary in June.I concede it’s unlikely that 2026 will see Farage pay for his starring role in that ongoing act of collective self-harm. But eventually Trump, Netanyahu, Orbán and the others must face a reckoning for the pain they have caused and the damage they have done.

This should be his big year, the make-or-break 2026. Last year his Reform party finally began to top the polls and he was feted by Washington as the UK’s Trump andnext prime minister. So how now would he turn a sheaf of poll results into a disciplined election-winning machine? Or has he for the past year merely been doing what most third parties do at this stage of a parliament, which is feast on the misfortune of their opponents?The polls sent Reform surging into a steady lead last spring. It held that position through the summer, with a high of29%according to YouGov, and33%according to More in Common. But pollsters now suggest thatFarage’s party may have peaked– with YouGov’s December polling showing a drop in its vote share to 26%, its lowest since April. Some of this has been credited toincreasing supportfor the Tory leader Kemi Badenoch and to the joint Lib Dem/Green vote surging to nearly 30%. It seems likely that this confusion will survive through this May’s local elections. Betting in this field is for madmen.Meanwhile Farage’s Reform remains a classic one-man show. I recall interviewing him before the referendum about how things were going in his back office. Was it still the much-publicised chaos? He gazed up at the ceiling. The fact is that British politics has long handled the occasional star performer, an Enoch Powell, Roy Jenkins, Nye Bevan, Lloyd George or Winston Churchill. But it rarely votes “presidentially” to put them into office. The US votes for populist stars, relying on its constitution to curb any resulting autocracy. Britain votes for parties and their programmes.Alexis de Tocqueville’s famous claim that American politics defaults to the mob and British politics to the club was never truer than it is today. The electoral success of the Tories over the past century has been rooted in presenting the voters with a disciplined group of reasonably competent ministers. They obeyed one vital requirement of cabinet government, collective loyalty. They worked and socialised together and governed as friends. The same was true of many Labour cabinets.That tradition survived even through the Cameron years. It collapsed under the conspiratorial era of Boris Johnson and has never recovered. The concept of the internecine cabinet emerged into the open and has never disappeared. It can be seen today in the absurd factionalism of Keir Starmer’s first year in office, with ministers and officials relentlesslybriefingagainst each other.The same applies to Farage. He has to defend his colleagues – and himself – from one unfortunate remark after another. It has turned leadership and even membership into a revolving door. Reform has had three chairs in under two years. They come and go in the night. Reform’s latest leader in Wales iscurrently in prison.The result is barely recognisable as a party. Reform’s nearest thing to a shadow chancellor appears to be a property tycoon,Nick Candy. There is no core of seasoned professionals that is so important to electoral success. There is rather a stage army of dissident former Tory MPs such as Andrea Jenkyns, Ann Widdecombe and Danny Kruger. None is famous for party loyalty. Reform’s chief whip, Lee Anderson, had previously stood both for election for the Labour party and the Conservative party.Farage has tried desperately to position his party on the political spectrum. He grovelled his way to Mar-a-Lago to be lauded by Trump and Elon Musk. He then had toendure Musk’s contemptwhen he refused to back the appalling Tommy Robinson. He wisely distanced himself from Trump’s more extreme associates, such as theHeritage Foundation. But he purports to be a friend of Steve Bannon and has spent time withJD Vance. This is risky when Trump isway below par among British voters, with 22% for and 72% against.On policy, Farage runs another risk in identifying himself almost solely with immigration. Single-issue parties may do well in a good year, but who knows where immigration will be in 2029? Reform may have 12 councils under its belt, but whether its adoption of Musk’schainsaw approachto public spending is a vote-winner remains to be seen. Farage is now frantically identifying issues such asthe countrysideand net-zero energy subsidies on which Tories might switch to him.Farage has undeniable charisma on the platform. He can be affable, humorous, passionate and concise: qualities suited to de Tocqueville’s mob but absent from his club. They will also be absent from Westminster’s murky offices and corridors over the next two years. The one reliable prediction is that the next election will send to Westminster the multiparty shambles of a hung parliament. From that I do not expect Farage to emerge on top.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsNigel FarageOpinionReform UKDonald TrumpImmigration and asylumcommentShareReuse this content"

Approaching the stop on Campbell Parade, I want to get off the bus, walk across the road past the pavilion, soak up the air, feel sand under my feet, feel my sadness – but my hand stays put in my daughter’s, my arm around my son on my lap. The bus rolls on.I can’t explain how beautifulBondi beachis on a Sunday summer afternoon. You have to be there to believe it. There are no words for how golden it is as the heat seeps out from the sun and sinks into the sea.Bondi has been just down the road for most of my Australian life. I had been talking about taking my British friend there for fish and chips that Sunday night three weeks ago and only decided against it because I thought the day was too nice. It’ll be crowded; I’m feeling curmudgeonly. Let’s leave the happy crowds to enjoy it. We’ll just stay here at my dad’s house. Have a quiet night in. Then we heard a chopper and then another, and then my phone started buzzing.I want to talk about how existentially joyful Bondi makes me feel on a pretty summer afternoon; truly astonishing to see all the people in this beautiful place, just hanging out in peace, sand blowing at their legs. The great wall, the pyramids, the moon with rocket ships have nothing on this monument built of safe people in the sun, in peace, together, different, sharing the golden light. What a colossal thing to have constructed out of will.Bondi has long been the spiritual home of Sydney’s Jews. Now it will be a place of remembrance and grief | Michael VisontayRead moreI cannot comprehend anyone seeing that and notseeingit. I can’t get my head around any ideology that wants to destroy it. Isn’t this just tooniceto pin crazy hate on? Why not just get a gelato, maybe? Watch the sun go down?When I was at law school, there was a concept we were taught, which was the idea of “the reasonable man”. The best legal minds in Australia have pondered the question of who the reasonable man is, and – the answer, embedded in our laws, is that the reasonable man is “the man on the bus to Bondi”. It makes me laugh a little bit, every time I get on the bus to Bondi, wondering, which of us here is “the reasonable man”?Ican’t bear to be on social media right now, seeing all my lovely clever thoughtful friends saying clever thoughtful things. Trying to make this event proportional to the whole of everything, the context of world events and not overweight our pain and fear because of course other people, other places, also have pain and fear.It’s not that all that context isn’t true, it’s just that it’s also a lie.Every second post I see is telling me what the thing that happened in Bondi was actually about. It’s about immigration, or Israel or the Labor party or the Jews, it’s about western culture, the Crusades, Islamic State, the Oslo accords. It’s about Australia and what they hate about us. It’s about hate speech and Islamism and the internet.It’s not, though, is it?Oh, some of them are right, I’m sure. But it’s not really about any of that. It’s actually just people.It’s people who went to a place where people were, unprotected and joyful, and the people who came used guns to force bits of metal into the people who were there so that the parts inside their bodies would stop working and they’d die.The rest is set dressing.I grew up in and around Bondi. It’s where we swam, where we walked and played. Where I did pottery class at four and flirted at 14. When I lived in Bondi in my 20s, I was a member of the surf life saving club. I’ve spent summers patrolling there, rescuing tipsy pink tourists from their failure to apply sun cream, pulling backpackers out of rips.My parents would take me and my brother out beyond the breakers into the calm waters before we could even walk. I was convinced I could breathe underwater and would dive and dive. The golden flickering of light when you’re looking up through the green water, the underside of a wave rolling over.How is it possible to see people being people with their families on the beach as a part of any war?Mum would meet her sisters there at the pool on weekends. My twin aunts would swim the beach length, a kilometre wide, then back, diving out from the rocks at the iceberg baths. My aunt Emily would do it topless; so cool and arty and strong, her hair in sun-bleached salty curls.My own motherhood is Bondi-born. My WhatsApp mother’s group chat is called Bondi Beach Mums. We message every day, asking for advice and sympathy, reassuring each other that it’s fine, that’s normal, checking allergies and saying oh yeah, mine’s doing that thing too; so weird, that’s normal.I’m still a million miles short of explaining what Bondi means because to me it’s layered with a thousand memories of sun and wind; the changing face of the ocean cupped in the warm sandy curve of the beach.Late nights talking under stars, walking wide berths around the backpackers making out. Swishing your ankles in the water, choosing with your feet the right density and wetness of the sand. Sprints from the water to the wall. The skate ramp kids, the wall-art in the dawn, the glamour girls in leggings setting forth, matcha in hand, for the Bondi to Bronte walk. The old Russians playing chess in the arches of the pavilion. The tessellated tiles, the dolphin statue that I would climb, my daughter climbs it too. Old Jewish women with their tiny dogs. The muscled men at the outdoor gym, the punctuation point of a stubborn steak-baked oldie in too-tight togs, striding through a TikTok dance in progress, defiantly uncool.My Bondi mums group chat on the Sunday evening, as the sun set, all asking if we were all here, inside, alive, OK, our children? Partners? Safe? OK? Our neighbours? Doctors? Safe? Alive? It’s two, now three, now 10, 10 and the gunman, one of the gunmen, and a little girl dead. It’s 12, 15, they’re coming up the hill, it’s just a rumour, don’t repost misinformation. Where’s your dad, your mum? Tell me that you’re safe at home? The rabbi’s wife has a two-month-old baby boy. The rabbi’s dead.I think of my granny, when she was young and glamorous at Redleaf pool in the 1960s or the Icebergs in her high-waisted leopard print bikini. I have a photo. She’d point to it, talking about how she had chosen to be here. When she had survived the Holocaust, when she had accepted that all of her family was never coming home, how she decided it would be Australia she’d build her life in. She chose it because it felt so far away from war, from that hatred, so far away from things like that. Things which could go wrong.Bondi is the postcard of Australia. It manifests so much about us as a culture; our egalitarianism, our openness, our mixing pot of cultures, hanging out together on the beach. Our glamour, our dagginess, our families and brunch places and surf life savers. Our tanned and muscled glitz, the bright dazzle underwritten by the undeniable realness of the place; its sun and sand and weather. It’s a symbol, yes, but mostly it’s this place I hop off the bus at when I want to be somewhere nice.Bondi beach’s golden light can never be extinguished. It has always returned from its darkest days | Brigid DelaneyRead moreHow is it possible to see people being people with their families on the beach as a part of any war? I begin to think my morality is quite small, in some way, because I just can’t. I can’t get my head around it when my friends frame up these wounds and deaths in any kind of context. Talking reasonably about all the factors. Pro or anti this or that; part of this other thing over there. Killing Jews at the beach doesn’t exist for me in context, world politics played out by proxy on the bodies of people here. I hit a limit of my capacity to understand. It’s just awful murder.To reframe it in some cleverly formulated geopolitical context feels grotesque to me; treating the people at the beach as pieces in a dinner-table argument about ideologies – it feels like acquiescing to that distorted and grotesque delusion that took two men to Bondi on a lovely Sunday evening to fling death at children in the sun.Friends of mine have done beautiful community work in the last days and weeks; memorials and music and community, asserting that we are unbroken and unbowed in the face of hate; that we will fight this horror with our kindness and joy and connection. And I can’t get off the bus. I know it’s not reasonable. I guess I’m not the reasonable man.I don’t want to get off at Bondi with my children and look around me with untrusting eyes, to feel the air changed and warped by horror. Or worse, to feel nothing changed. So the doors close, the bus drives on. I sit on the seat and look out the window and see all these things and places that have made me feel safe my whole life blurred through the salt on the glass and my tears.Alice Fraser is an author, comedian and podcaster.

The terminal was almost empty, but security was intense. Medics in face shields stood alongside masked officials, making the place feel less like an arrival hall and more like a containment zone.Our bus – carrying newly arrived Afghans evacuated afterthe fall of Kabul– was escorted by police to a tall, expensive-looking hotel. One by one, we were funnelled into separate rooms, processed with clinical efficiency. We were told little, except that we would not leave for two weeks.Kabul had fallen only days earlier. In the space of weeks, a 20-year experiment in rebuilding a country collapsed. An entire generation – my generation – who had grown up believing in elections, education and the possibility of peace, watched their future disappear almost overnight.‘International community has lost interest’: Afghanistan’s first female vice-president sees history repeatingRead moreBehind locked doors, with heavy hearts and very little certainty, we began the wait to start a new life in a new country, Australia.Within minutes of checking in, my phone rang. It was Sardar, another newly arrived Afghan. His voice sounded different – lighter, almost joyful.“Turn on the TV,” he said. “Cricket is on. Rashid is playing. Here. In Australia.”That moment mattered more than most Australians will ever know.Locked inside quarantine rooms in Brisbane, Afghan refugees glued themselves to television screens as Rashid Khan took the field for the Adelaide Strikers. By then, Rashid was already one of the Big Bash League’s most successful overseas players: 98 wickets in 69 matches, an economy rate of 6.44, and a bowling average hovering around 17 – elite numbers in any T20 competition. He had also become a crowd favourite, not just for his skill but for the joy and energy he brought to the game.He bowled with his usual menace. He hit late-order sixes at a strike rate well over 150. And on his hands were gloves stitched in the three colours of the Afghan flag: black, red and green.At a time when the Taliban had seized every government building, every embassy and every official symbol ofAfghanistan, Rashid and his teammates were among the very few Afghans still carrying the tricolour on a global stage.Soon, we saw others too: Mohammad Nabi and Zahir Khan in Melbourne Renegades colours; Mujeeb Ur Rahman turning out for the Brisbane Heat. For Afghan refugees in quarantine, cricket was not escapism – it was continuity. Proof that Afghanistan had not vanished from the world.That is why the silence around Afghan cricket now feels so heavy.View image in fullscreenAfghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi takes photos with fans during the T20 World Cup 2022 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Photograph: James Ross/AAPAustralia has repeatedly cancelled or declined to schedule bilateral series against Afghanistan’s men’s team, citing the Taliban’s ban on women and girls from sport. This stance has been consistent, quiet and firm. The intention is understandable. But the impact it has shows it is deeply flawed.Afghan male cricketers are being penalised for decisions made by a regime they do not represent, do not control and often cannot safely criticise. Many have family still inside Afghanistan. Some are themselves refugees. Yet they are pretty much the only visible Afghans the world still engages with – and so they alone absorb the consequences of international outrage.Meanwhile, Afghan cricket as a sporting story has continued to defy expectations. Since gaining full ICC membership in 2017,Afghanistan’s men’s teamhas steadily risen. In 2024, they reached the semi-finals of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, defeating established teams along the way and cementing their reputation as one of the game’s most remarkable success stories.Their fanbase is vast and deeply emotional – not just inside Afghanistan, but across the diaspora in Australia, Europe and the Middle East. Matches featuring Afghanistan routinely draw huge online engagement, with millions following players like Rashid across leagues from the IPL to the BBL.And yet, this summer, the Afghan presence that once felt so visible in Australia has faded. Rashid’s recent absence from the Big Bash League has been due largely to injury and scheduling, not selection – but symbolically, the effect is the same. A generation of Afghan Australians no longer see themselves reflected on Australia’s biggest cricket stage.This is not an argument to simply “play them” and move on.Cricket Australia has leverage – moral, financial and symbolic – and it can use it far more effectively than quiet disengagement.There is another path.Australia could pursue conditional engagement, explicitly tied to visible and material support for Afghan women cricketers now living in exile – many of them in Australia. BBL contracts for Afghan male players could be paired with funding, facilities, visas, coaching roles or broadcast platforms for displaced Afghan female athletes.Rather than isolation, Australia could lead.Cricket Australia could also use its influence within the ICC – where Afghanistan remains a full member – to push for structural reforms that allow exiled women’s teams to gain recognition and pathways to competition, instead of relying on symbolic withdrawal that leaves everyone worse off.None of this legitimises the Taliban. It bypasses them entirely.Usman Khawaja’s retirement farewell shows how cricket can be an expression of character | Gideon HaighRead moreWhen I first arrived in Australia, watching Rashid Khan under those lights did something politics could not. It cut through fear and grief and reminded us that dignity, pride and belonging were still possible.Cricket has always claimed to be more than a game. For Afghans in quarantine, it truly was. Australia can still honour that power – not by erasing Afghan cricketers from view, but by using the game to stand with all of them.Shadi Khan Saif is an editor, producer and journalist who has worked in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Germany and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsCricketOpinionCricket AustraliaAfghanistanAfghanistan cricket teamAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

What’s the excuse  so close to breakfast?Fri 2 Jan 2026 03.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 12.04 ESTShareFirst and foremost, let me say: I love love. I’m in love – I’m happily married with two boys. I’m surrounded by love, because most of my friends and family are in long-term relationships and have kids of their own. Heck, I even love it when strangers find love. Since its inception, I have watched every episode ofPop the Balloon or Find Love– a US reality dating show hosted by Arlette Amuli. While it’s entertaining observing how treacherous the dating market is, I’m more thrilled when two people match and commence their own love journey.However, for all my appreciation of love, public displays of affection (PDAs) on the morning commute should be punishable by prison. I’m talking hugging, kissing, even sitting on each other’s laps – all of the above are abominable to watch. In my dictatorship, those who committed such crimes would be locked up without due process. The British tonguing police (BTP) would ensure that perpetrators were swiftly caught.They would not pass go, they would not collect £200. They would go directly to jail.Don’t get me wrong: I understand indulging in a little affection in the evenings and on weekends after a night out. You’ve had a few drinks, you’re feeling uninhibited, and that may manifest in an embrace and a kiss on your bus or train journey home. I get it. I love love. If it doesn’t become a show – do your thing. But what’s the excuse for feeling randy at eight o’clock on a Tuesday morning?Nothing should arouse you at that time. If anything, if you are stimulated, work is the last place you should be heading. I don’t see how you can be productive under the influence of excessive titillation. That sort of behaviour should be viewed in the same light as drink and drugs: stay home, relieve yourself fully from its effects and then, only once you’ve recovered, return to work. That’s one way to spare us from your early morning lip-locking.I’m telling you, I’m happy for you: love who you love.

We must stand in solidarity with each otherFri 2 Jan 2026 02.09 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 04.56 ESTShareWhile many Australians remain in a state of anger, grief and reflection due to the devastating Bondi terror attack, Muslim community leaders are in a predicament. What is to be done about the ensuing rise of anti-Muslim sentiment, hatred and racism that their communities face?Following the 14 December mass shooting, community registers that documentIslamophobiahave largely been reluctant to speak publicly about the spike in Islamophobia, out of concern of being perceived to trivialise the killing of Jewish Australians, their suffering, or vying for sympathy from the public.Nevertheless, the registers have recorded a surge in reports of Islamophobia. These include individuals receiving abusive and threatening calls, a spate of mosques and Islamic centres across Australia reporting vandalism, a Muslim cemetery in New South Wales being desecrated, physical attacks and a wave of online hate. The Islamophobia Register Australia and Action Against Islamophobia have both recorded a spike in such incidents. The Islamophobia Register Australia, for example, has recorded a 740% increase in reports since the Bondi terror attack.Unsurprisingly, most reports received by the community registers are from Muslim women who have reported being spat at, abused, attacked and threatened. Many women who I spoke to over the past two weeks have actively adjusted their normal movements in public due to a heightened perceived risk of danger to them and their children.This increased wave of anxiety and unease that Muslims are now feeling is present in everyday community discussions around the nation.What is the status of Islamic State, the group linked to the Bondi attacks?Read moreThe Bondi terror attack demonstrates that some Australians struggle to distinguish between the jihadist group Islamic State (also known as Isis or Isil) and Islam, the religion of almost 2 billion people worldwide (despite the extremist group beingdenouncedby Muslim religious leaders around the globe, andimams across Australia).This has been made abundantly clear from the plethora of messages that littered social media following the attack:“The common denominator in both Gaza and Bondi? Islam.”“There will be no peace until you can irradicate [sic] Islam from society.”“It’s not a phobia, it’s pattern recognition.”These ideas shape people’s attitudes towards ordinary Muslim Australian citizens. They engender social exclusion and fear. For others, it provides them with a “permission to hate” Muslims. Ultimately, it produces an “us” and “them” dynamic, which undermines Australia’s core values such as fairness, inclusion and compassion.It is imperative that in combating extremism, hate and antisemitism, we don’t unwittingly nurture a fertile environment for the same kind of anti-Muslim hate that became a deluge following the 9/11 terror attacks to reappear.Muslim community leaders understand that law enforcement agencies have full justification to act on intelligence. They are told to trust the police, but trust is a two-way street.Take the arrest of the seven Muslim youth (dubbed “the Liverpool seven” in some circles). All were released the next day, without charge. However, many Muslims I spoke to, young and old, were frustrated and anxious, telling me that the “dramatic” arrests simply reinforce the idea that Muslims are suspects, and this spreads paranoia. Others believed that the arrests were “performative” to let the public know that the police are tough, vigilant and serious about terrorism. Everyone understood that terrorism is anathema, and that police must investigate credible leads, but they all feared that they, as Muslim Australians, would now have to endure the public backlash.Counter-terrorism raids may erode trust between Muslim communities and police, while fanning public anxiety about terrorism, Muslims and Islam. This ultimately adds to prejudice and discrimination against Muslims.It is critical that the police understand this.We cannot afford to return to the days of suspicion, profiling, guilt by association, securitisation and surveillance, where Muslims felt they had to constantly prove their innocence and reassure others that they pose no threat. Muslim Australians find this exhausting and distressing. They should not have to carry the collective responsibility for acts of terror carried out by criminals.No Muslim leader wishes to diminish the pain, tragedy and suffering of the Jewish Australian community. There is legitimate concern still plaguing Muslim leaders that to talk about Islamophobia now will be perceived to be engaging incompetitive victimhood. I share this concern. However, we can speak about both, standing in solidarity with Jewish communities by affirming our shared commitment to safety, dignity and mutual respect.Debate Islam all you like. Be critical, robust and challenging. But be dignified.Don’t carry out the work of the extremists who want society to rip itself apart, pitting neighbour against neighbour and worshipper against worshipper, forcing people to build walls and retreat.For the preservation of societal integrity, we must stand guard against what Frank Furedi calls “a culture of fear” and instead follow the sage advice of Marie Curie: “Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”Aftab Malik is Australia’s special envoy to combat IslamophobiaExplore more on these topicsIslamophobiaOpinionAntisemitismBondi beach terror attackIslamcommentShareReuse this content"

That’s the reality facing more and more people in BritainKirsty MajorChristine wanted to enjoy her retirement, but then the banks of a local brook burst and turned her and her neighbours’ lives upside-downFri 2 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 14.03 ESTShareWhen I visited Christine’s bungalow in Trowell, Nottinghamshire, and asked if I should take my shoes off, she joked: “I wouldn’t worry, I’ll be getting a new carpet soon enough when it floods again.” She’s got another good one about the time she, a 70-year-old great-grandmother, had to climb through her conservatory window because her front and back doors had been sealed shut by flood barriers. “If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry,” she says. And there is a lot to cry about: mainly the fact that her home is unsellable due to multiple floods.In 2020, the brook that backs on to Christine’s home burst its banks and water poured into her house, as well as the homes of her neighbours Jackie, 67, and Rhona, 76. As we sit around a table drinking tea, they tell me about having to rip out their floorboards, skirting boards, kitchen cupboards and entire bathrooms. Doors had to be taken off their hinges and thrown into skips. Fridges, washing machines, furniture, all joined the pile.Fortunately, their insurers paid for their houses to be refurbished and for furniture to be replaced. Property Flood Resilience assessments were carried out by the Environment Agency (EA), the government body responsible for flood management. As not enough houses were affected, the optimum but most expensive solution – to install embankments and walls to stop water from topping the brook – was not implemented. (For context, the EA has faced an overall cut in its funding of50%during the past decade.)Instead, the cheaper alternative of flood-proofing individual houses was offered. Christine, Jackie and Rhona had a mix of flood doors and barriers installed, and were provided with pumps to remove any water that did make it into their properties. In 2023, having been delayed by Covid, the work was finally completed. Eight months later, their houses flooded again.It turns out the assessments had missed the fact that their homes were built on platforms and the water was coming up through the ground and into them. The barriers provided only stopped surface water from getting into their properties.While they were telling me this, heavy rain began to thud on the conservatory roof. Christine looked concerned. “It makes you panic,” she says. In bad weather, the women remain vigilant for the next flood warning. When there is one, they log on to the relevant government website and stay up during the night, fully dressed, messaging one another in their group chat and checking the levels provided by a gauge fixed to the brook.Jackie has an exact plan of how to stack her furniture so that some of it can be saved, and plastic raisers to place under what furniture can’t be stacked. Then there are the flood barriers to be erected in her garage and outside her back door. I lifted one up, and it felt as heavy as a barbell. This is no way for a pensioner to live, but as far as the EA is concerned, it has done its job for Christine, Jackie and Rhona. The work carried out has made them “flood-resilient” rather than flood-proof.Floodingis to be expected, and damage minimised.Residents believe that the flooding began after the building of multiple nearby housing developments, with one more leisure development to come.Extra discharge and surface runoff now drain into the brook. According to the lead local flood authority, once all the developments in the area are complete, runoff into the brook will be about 44% more compared with the pre-development baseline. The particular shape of this brook means that when it is overwhelmed with too much water, too quickly, it creates a second river – straight into people’s homes.View image in fullscreenThe brook near Christine’s home in Trowell, Nottinghamshire. She says flooding is caused by water runoff due to new houses being built at the top of her road.Photograph: Andrew Fox/The GuardianPlanning rules should prevent any new building developments from increasing flood risks, but there is a small, but not inconsequential, loophole that is preventing this. Developments are assessed one at a time and often done in phases. Taken on its own, a project may be viable, but when the impact of multiple developments is added up, this can have disastrous consequences for communities. Every time we build we not only add more runoff, but we also build on the very land that acts as a natural flood protection: tarmac and concrete don’t soak up water, whereas soil does.Repeated risk of flooding is making Christine, Jackie and Rhona’s properties unsellable. Like all homeowners, they are required to inform buyers of any flooding in the previous five years, and unsurprisingly this has affected the sales of their homes. Jackie would like to move in order to be closer to her soon to be born grandchild, but looking at sales of similar properties in her area, she may have to drop the price significantly and use her pension money to help her move. Her experience tracks with larger trends: a study fromBayes Business Schoolsuggests that homes at risk of flooding are sold for between 8% and 32% lower than average compared with non-affected properties.Even when sellers are able to find buyers, some lenders, such asNationwide, may no longer provide mortgages. The government has stepped in to cover the flood-risk element of home insurance until 2039 so that customers do not see a spike in premiums. However, the end date for this scheme and the fact that it doesn’t cover houses built after 2009 means that mortgage lenders do not want to fund homes that will lose value and be sold at a loss if repossession occurs when a mortgage is defaulted.Flooded and forgotten: the UK’s waters are rising and we’re being kept in the dark | John HarrisRead moreThis is a dynamic that may become worse as flood risk encroaches on more of the UK’s housing stock. Labour’s “build, baby, build” housing policy means more homes are being built ongreen beltland, meaning less natural flood defences, more runoff and increased flood risk for existing homes. Even worse, Guardian analysis has predicted that more than100,000 of these new homescould be built on the highest-risk flood zones in England. At the same time,extreme weather isincreasing because of climate breakdown and theEnvironment Agency datasays 6.3m properties, residential homes and businesses are in areas at risk of flooding, rising to 8m by 2050.All this points to a potential risk for the financial sector. As long as the government is covering flood risk, theBank of Englandsees little threat to financial stability from flooding, but after the current scheme ends the outlook may look very different as negative equity and mortgage defaults lead to banks having reduced collateral and capital.Of course, all of this may be needless worry if the government remains an insurer of last resort. But that is dependent on what politicians decide in 2039. Meanwhile, Christine, Jackie and Rhona will spend their days at the mercy of the weather forecast.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianExplore more on these topicsFloodingOpinionExtreme weatherEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Now only fast food and fine dining are thrivingFri 2 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 14.02 ESTShareSpare a thought for the poor French restaurateur. Once the iconic image of a sybaritic nation that loved nothing more than a boozy meal out with friends or colleagues, the French restaurant isin deep crisis.Traditional restaurants are closing faster than you can shout “garçon!”, as eating habits change and the cost of living pinches.“It’s a catastrophe for our profession,” Franck Chaumès, president of the restaurant branch of the Union of Hospitality Trades and Industries (UMIH) said in a television interview recently. “Some 25 restaurants are going out of business every day.” The UMIHhas demanded– so far in vain – that the government ration the opening of new restaurants, in proportion to the local population, and license only professionals who are qualified in cooking and accounting.The only businesses that seem immune to the hollowing out of France’s hospitality sector are those providing haute cuisine at eye-watering prices to the super-rich and fast-food chains such as the ubiquitous McDonald’s, which does a roaring trade.The days when business, politics and diplomacy were transacted over lengthy wine-fuelled lunches are mostly gone. When I started as a reporter in Paris in 1978, there was no point calling a ministry or corporate press office between 1pm and 3pm, even in a crisis. Everyone wasà table. Nowadays, only parliamentarians perpetuate the gluttonous tradition.Changing lifestyles, rising wholesale food prices and perverse tax rules are driving ever-more restaurant owners to the wall, as ordinary French people struggle to make ends meet. Gen Z and millennials eat less, drink less alcohol and spend less time at the dining table. Add to that theinroads of home-deliveryservices such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats – often ferrying food prepared in “dark kitchens”, without a dining room attached – and it’s easy to see how old-fashioned restaurants are struggling to survive.“I used to serve 75 covers every lunchtime, and we had at least two home-cooked dishes of the day, with meat or fish and fresh vegetables,” says Alex Diril, who used to run a bar-restaurant in Paris’s fifth arrondissement, frequented by office workers, craftsmen and young people from nearby universities. “Things changed after the pandemic. Customers who used to eat out every day came maybe once or twice at the beginning of the week. You would offer people a fresh, healthyplat du jour, and mostly they wanted burgers and fries. As the wholesale cost of food rose, we couldn’t increase prices because of the competition from fast-food joints and sandwich places.”Despite the hard work put into serving freshly cooked food, the restaurant was losing money. Diril cut his losses and stopped serving food at the end of 2024. His bar-tobacco shop is just one of thousands of victims of a crisis that is changing the face of France.The Covid pandemic was a turning point in many ways. When restrictions eased, fewer than two-thirds of middle-class workers returned to the office full-time. Many continue to work from home at least part of the week, and some take a lunchbox or grab a sandwich on the fly when they do go to the office.Tax and employment ruleshave compounded restaurateurs’ woes. VAT is charged at 5.5% on takeaway meals, but 10% on eat-in dining. Moreover, since Covid the luncheon vouchers that many French workers receive as part of their pay can be spent on food in supermarkets, not just in restaurants. That has dealt a body blow to lunchtime dining.The advent of online shopping, coupled with restrictions on driving and parking in urban centres has also hit the restaurant business hard.Statistically, the French have long spentmore time eating and drinkingthan other comparable countries: two hours and 13 minutes on average per day, according to a 2015 study, compared to one hour and 18 minutes in the UK, and barely an hour in the US. But habits have changed since then, influenced by US fast-food culture as well as healthier eating. Young people are as likely to go to the gym as to a restaurant during their lunch break.The 35-hourworking week, introduced in France in 1998, forced many small restaurants with kitchen staff to reduce their opening hours. Try getting served in a provincial restaurant after 1.30pm and you are likely to encounter a Gallic shrug and a curt “la cuisine est fermée” (the kitchen’s closed), if not a surly “non, mais vous avez vu l’heure?” (haven’t you seen the time?). Serving staff are also increasingly hard to find. Since the pandemic, fewer French people want to work the unsocial evening and weekend hours on which restaurants depend.Ironically, while the British government subsidised its citizens to “eat out to help out” – at the risk of spreading contagion – the French government showered restaurateurs with money tostay shutduring the Covid lockdowns. While other businesses received interest-free loans to ease their cashflow, restaurants got outright grants. “I’d never seen so much money. We couldn’t believe our eyes,” says Martine David, who ran a family restaurant in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in southern France. There was a six-month boom when lockdown was lifted. French people regained their freedom and splurged pent-up savings on a meal out. But business never really returned to normal after the pandemic.Restaurateurs now face a choice between reheating mass-produced pre-cooked frozen food from wholesalers to cut costs, or trying to attract customers who care about healthy eating with a short menu of locally sourced produce cooked to order, which has a higher labour cost. Sadly, the former are faring better than the latter.Bon appetit!Paul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy CentreExplore more on these topicsFranceOpinionFoodRestaurantsFast foodEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Today the NHS rolls out a new jab, alongside measles, mumps and rubellaWes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careThu 1 Jan 2026 23.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 05.07 ESTShareAs any parent knows, there are few things more disruptive to family life than a child covered from head to toe in itchy chickenpox spots. The sleepless nights. The constant application of calamine lotion. The scramble to take time off work while your little one recovers.That’s why today’s expansion of the NHS childhood vaccination programme will come as such a relief to so many families. The new combined vaccine, free on the NHS, will protect young children in England against chickenpox (varicella), measles, mumps and rubella. Children will be offered theMMRV vaccineat 12 and 18 months of age, and GP surgeries in England are contacting families from today to arrange appointments. This will mean fewer days missed from nursery and school, fewer urgent calls to the GP and fewer parents having to miss work.Research showsthat half of children catch chickenpox by the age of four, and 90% by the time they are 10 years old. While most cases resolve on their own, chickenpox costs families and the wider economy around £24m a year in lost income and productivity. This new vaccine will help reduce that burden considerably.But beyond the practical benefits, this rollout addresses something more serious. Chickenpox is often thought of as a mild childhood illness, but it can lead to severe complications requiring hospitalisation – including bacterial infections such as group A streptococcus, pneumonia and encephalitis. Even in recent years, there have been cases that have leftchildren on morphine in hospital, with others gettingpneumonia and joint infections– and even seriousflesh-eating diseases.The combined MMRV vaccine has been safely used for decades, and is already part of routine vaccination programmes in several countries. The US, Canada, Australia and Germanyhave all seen substantial decreasesin chickenpox cases and hospital admissions since rolling out their programmes. In the US alone, the vaccinehas preventedan estimated 91m cases of chickenpox in 25 years, as well as 238,000 hospitalisations and almost 2,000 deaths.The evidence is clear: vaccines work. Theyprevent millions of deathsworldwide every year. Diseases such as smallpox, polio and tetanus, which once killed or disabled millions of people, have over the past 50 years either gone or are nowvery rarely seen.In this government’s10-year health plan, we set out how we are supporting parents to raise the healthiest generation of children ever, shifting the health service from sickness to prevention and strengthening public trust in vaccination. At a time when misinformation spreads quickly online, it’s more important than ever that people are able to trust in medical science, and the research scientists, analysts and clinicians who follow the evidence. In some countries, it’s clear that access to vaccines and accurate information about themhas been restricted, withordinary people paying the price.Building trust is why I’ve pushed back so hard against therhetoric that ignores scientific evidenceabout the excellent safety profile and effectiveness of vaccines.It is always OK for people to ask questions or want to know more about why vaccines are important; it’s why we regularly make sure people haveup-to-date information, and make sure that expert clinicians are in the media explaining why they’re safe.But the doubt and misinformation seeded even by those politicians who should know better, such as Nigel Farage andsenior figures in Reform, undermine public health. Worse, they undermine the trust that people put into our health service.We’re fortunate in Britain to have a healthcare system built on clinical excellence and peerless research. Today’svaccine rolloutis based on decades of scientific evidence. By reducing severe cases and complications, this programme is expected to save the NHS around £15m a year in costs for treatment. But most importantly,it will help protect thousandsof children from becoming seriously unwell.Wes Streeting is the secretary of state for health and social care and Labour MP for Ilford NorthDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ellen DeGeneres, Robin Wright and Courtney Love moved to England; Rosie O’Donnell opted for Ireland; Eva Longoria, Spain. Other Trump critics, including Richard Gere, Lena Dunham and Ryan Gosling, have upped sticks without citing the re-election as a motivating factor.In the case of Clooney, however, there has appeared little doubt that his decision to gain French citizenship was primarily because of Trump, whose re-election he energetically campaigned against. Yet amid the heat and headlines generated by the pair’s war of words, some of the actor’s reasons for relocating may have flown under the radar.‘He’ll become an ambassador for the Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée’The Clooneys’ 170-hectare (420-acre) Provence estate, capped by an 18th-century chateau, encompasses a swimming pool, ornamental lake, lavender garden, boules pitch and olive grove. It also includes a 20-acre vineyard, planted 25 years ago by agronomist Laurence Berlemont, whose previous clients include Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at Château Miraval, just 30 minutes away. Under Berlemont’s steering, the wines of Miraval have become lucrative and celebrated, with healthy international sales and rosettes from Le Guide Hachette des Vins.View image in fullscreenBrignoles in the Var, France, where the Clooney’s  Domain du Canadel is located.Photograph: Laurent Laurent Vu/Sipa/ShutterstockEven closer to the Clooneys is George Lucas’s Château Margüi – AKA Skywalker Vineyards – a substantial wine and olive oil making enterprise (plus high-end holiday lets). Also nearby is Le Plan-de-la-Tour, the estate formerly owned by Johnny Depp, featuring vineyards, olive groves, and a Pirates of the Caribbean-themed wine cave. The estates of celebrity vintners such as Kylie Minogue, John Malkovich and Jon Bon Jovi are also in the area.Historically, the fruits of the vines at the estate now owned by the Clooneys have been fed into the local cooperative, but the president of the Coteaux Varois appellation syndicate appeared eager for the incomers to “exploit the vineyard”.“In buying in our region,” said Eric Lambert, “[Clooney] will certainly become a new ambassador for the AOC [Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée].” Meanwhile, Berlemont hassaidClooney joined her for blending sessions, and praised his “good palate”. “He’s very humble,” she added, “ready to listen”.There were evenmurmuringsin the wine press that the Clooneys would debut a rosé and a white as early as 2025. That has not come to pass, yet Clooney is no stranger to alcoholic entrepreneurship: in 2017 he sold Casamigos – the tequila brand he co-founded four years earlier – for $1bn (£790m).‘I don’t want my kids to be worried about paparazzi’Both Lucas and Jolie-Pitt’s wines have benefited from high-profile partnerships with the nearby Cannes film festival. Yet Clooney’s association with European film festivals has been predominantly with Cannes’ rival in Venice. At least 10 of his films, including Jay Kelly last August, Wolfs the year before and his own directorial efforts – Suburbicon (2017), The Ides of March (2011) and Good Night, and Good Luck (2005) – have premiered on the Lido; he has only been to Cannes twice.View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney’s Lake Como villa.Photograph: Abaca/ShutterstockClooney’s affection for Italy has been long and mutual. In 2002, he bought a villa on Lake Como, and he and his wife,Amal Clooney, the British-Lebanese human rights barrister married in Venice in 2014. A 2012 profile of the actor noted that he was “fast becoming the most popular public figure in Italy … despite [being a man] who isn’t Italian, doesn’t speak Italian, and lives here only in summertime.”So why did the Clooneys not seek Italian citizenship? A clue may lie in the actor’s praise for France’s privacy laws. In an interview withEsquire in October, Clooney said: “I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood. I don’t want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don’t want them being compared to somebody else’s famous kids.”Italian rules over publishing photographs of people in public without their consent have strengthened over the past decade, and are tighter than those in the US. Yet France’s are nonetheless more stringent, and the climate surrounding celebrity less excitable, especially in rural areas. Meanwhile, the secluded location of the Clooneys’ French estate acts a significant deterrent to those hoping for a photo. By contrast, anyone with a rowing boat can in theory gain a commanding view of the villas overlooking Lake Como.‘Significant consequences … including suspension of entry into the US’Others have questioned why Clooney did not apply for British citizenship, given that he and Amal have family there, as well as a house in Windsor since 2014. Amal also has chambers in London and two fellowships at Oxford – not the easiest commute from rural Provence.Yet it is her involvement on a 2024 advisory panel reviewing the international criminal court investigation into potential war crimes in Gaza that offers the strongest indication as to why the couple felt it imperative to relocate their family from Los Angeles.View image in fullscreenThe Clooneys at the Venice premiere of Wolves in 2024.Photograph: Fabio Frustaci/EPAIn April 2024, Clooney and her fellow panellists recommended that the ICC prosecutor Karim Khan issue an arrest warrant for Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuand former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant. In her statement, Clooney said there were “reasonable grounds to believe” that they had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity.A warrant was issued in November 2024, and the following February, Trump issued an executive order imposing sanctions on the ICC and naming Khan in its annexe, promising to “impose tangible and significant consequences on those responsible for the ICC’s transgressions, some of which may include the blocking of property and assets, as well as the suspension of entry into the United States of ICC officials, employees, and agents, as well as their immediate family members”.Last April, Amal was among a number of senior legal counsels to the ICCwarnedby the Foreign Office that they could be at risk of sanctions by the Trump administration, including being banned from entering the US.Much has been made of the need for the Clooneys to fast-track their French citizenship application before tougher requirements over language fluency are brought in at the start of 2026 (George’s French reportedly remains rusty). Yet the prospect of the whole family being unable to re-enter the US also seems likely to have hastened their exit.Explore more on these topicsFilmGeorge ClooneyAmal ClooneyEuropeUS politicsDonald TrumpCelebrityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He didn’t just play Bruce Springsteen’s father in biopic Deliver Me from Nowhere but, of course, co-created and starred in Netflix mega-hit Adolescence – the game-changing drama that sparked global debate about online misogyny, incel culture and the “manosphere”.His friend and regular collaboratorSteven Knightwatched admiringly from afar as the devastating four-parter became event TV. “My God, it was a cultural phenomenon,” he says, puffing out his cheeks with pride. “Adolescencegot people talking who don’t normally talk, about things they don’t normally talk about. Is there any finer achievement than having a direct, immediate and positive effect worldwide on human relationships? It’s like putting something on screen which is medicine. It’s actually good for you.”“Making an impact like that was beyond our wildest hopes,” says Graham. “Having a fella come up in Tesco and say: ‘I just want to thank you. I had a really good chat with my son the other night after we watched your programme.’ No disrespect but you can keep your awards and all that shiny bollocks. That’s the real accolade.”View image in fullscreenBeat surrender … Stephen Graham as Henry ‘Sugar’ in A Thousand Blows, season two.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+He hasalready won an Emmyfor Adolescence and was recently nominated for a Golden Globe but Graham retains a healthy scepticism about awards recognition. “What we do isn’t football,” he says. “It’s not competitive sport. There aren’t winners and losers. It’s subjective. I might think something’s a bag of shite and it gets five fucking Baftas. That’s happened quite a few times, in fact. I might get myself into trouble here but Cillian Murphy, right? Wonderful actor. He’s never won a Bafta for playing Tommy Shelby [in Peaky Blinders]! One of the finest performances I’ve ever seen. What the fuck’s that about? Things like Adolescence, which make an impression on the collective consciousness, come from nowhere. The fact that we got it made is in itself a win.”I am sitting down with Stephen and Steven to discuss the pyrotechnic return of their pugilistic period thrillerA Thousand Blows. The debut run was a smash hit for Disney+ last year. Now comes the sequel, which interweaves the illegal bare-knuckle boxing scene with the fortunes of the Forty Elephants, an all-female crime syndicate who specialised in pickpocketing and confidence tricks.One year after the events of the first season, Jamaican boxer Hezekiah Moscow (Malachi Kirby) is a shadow of his former fighting self. His deadly rival, Henry “Sugar” Goodson (Graham), is in even worse shape – estranged from his family and drinking himself to death. As the series begins, he’s straggly haired, bushy bearded and falling face down in puddles. He even has a nasty case of trenchfoot.“I know, it’s gross,” says Graham. “Those manky feet are a metaphor for the path Sugar has trodden in the time we’ve been away. He’s at his lowest point ever. Now he has to rebuild his sense of self.” As we know from his virtuoso turn in Shane Meadows’sThe Virtues, for a teetotaller, Graham is uncannily good at playing drunk. “I was the kind of kid who sat in working men’s clubs, getting cans of Coke and bags of crisps bought for me. I saw a lot of great pissheads! I tap into that.”View image in fullscreenHit-maker … the creator of the show, Steven Knight.Photograph: Robert ViglaskyGraham transformed his physique for the first series. With fewer fights this time, has his training slacked off? “No, I’ve still got it going on,” he says, pulling up his T-shirt to flex impressive biceps. “Look at them! This season, the fight Sugar is having is mainly with himself. But I’m still working out. I’m filming something at the minute where I play a prisoner, so I’ve adjusted the regime.” He rubs his shaven head to illustrate the point. “More of a prison workout plan with a low-carb diet.”Season one climaxed with Sugar beating his younger brother, Edward “Treacle” Goodson (James Nelson-Joyce) half to death. “These two boys went through hell growing up,” says Graham. “Everything Sugar did, he did for his brother. Now he’s betrayed that, so he’s questioning who he is as a human being.” That’s one beauty of basing his story on real historical figures, says Knight: “The truth gives our scripts authority. Records show that Sugar did badly beat his brother in a fight. All you need is that fact, then you’ve got a ton of stuff before it and after it to imagine.”Nelson-Joyce has come a long way since that fateful meeting in Nando’s a decade ago, when he approached Graham and was taken under his idol’s wing. “He really has,” says Graham. “After I gave him my details, Hannah [Walters, his wife, co-star and co-producer] looked at me and went: ‘I reckon he could play your brother one day.’ And here we are. I’m dead proud of the way James’s career is progressing. He deserves every bit of his success.”The punchy series comes out swinging for round two. This time, the bone-crunching violence spills out of the boxing ring and on to the streets of the East End. “There’s a lot more explosions and those are always exciting days to be on set,” grins Graham. “All these mad fellas and women come in and go: ‘Right, let’s blow something up over here.’ So they do it, then they always say: ‘We need bigger bangs and bigger flames. Let’s turn up the gas!’ It’s huge fun and when you see it on-screen, you go: ‘Wow.’”View image in fullscreenRivals … Graham with Malachi Kirby as Hezekiah Moscow in A Thousand Blows.Photograph: Robert Viglasky“Action scenes are great as long as nothing hits you,” says Knight. “Because it does happen. Scripting a fight feels ludicrous: ‘He swings a punch, he ducks, he swings again.’ But I genuinely think our show has the most authentic boxing sequences I’ve ever seen. The punches feel real.” He pauses. “Mentioning no names, but we’ve all seen how easy it is to do them badly.”Just as Wapping’s underworld is lacking leadership, Mary Carr (Erin Doherty), self-styled queen of the Forty Elephants, bursts back on the scene to reform her gang and reclaim her crown. As always, canny and charismatic Mary has a plan. This time, it’s riskier than ever. “Erin is unbelievable,” says Knight. “You can’t imagine anyone else playing Mary Carr. Somehow she just becomes her. I’m sure it isn’t effortless but Erin make it look like it is.”Stephen Graham: the ‘working-class, mixed-race kid’ who cares deeply about the workRead more“The only word I can use for Erin is mesmeric,” says Graham. “I could watch her reading the phone book. Mary looks after Sugar while he’s in recovery. We shot a whole day’s footage of her helping me through detox and there were scenes as an actor I’ll never forget. At one point, we sat on the floor of a bedroom above a pub and she just held me. It was a very vulnerable situation but the crew were so respectful, allowing us to stay in the moment. It was special. Something I’ll cherish deeply.”The Forty Elephants reflect the changing world of the late Victorian era. “It’s the truth. Realsocial history, rather than the stuff you read in textbooks. They ran their own organisation and were incredibly successful. Newspapers of the time were outraged and said: ‘How shocking that ladies are doing this,’ but nobody on the streets was surprised. Most working-class families are run by the mother. The only place equality wasn’t acknowledged was in the political system. In their own way, the Forty Elephants are like the suffragettes, looking around and saying: ‘Wait a minute, this is ridiculous.’”View image in fullscreen‘The only word I can use for Erin is mesmeric’ … Erin Doherty as Mary in A Thousand Blows, season two.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Disney+The two Steves are regular partners in crime, having worked together onPeaky Blinders,TabooandA Christmas Carol. What do they admire about each other’s work? Graham goes first: “Growing up, I loved writers who told working-class stories, like Alan Bleasdale, Jimmy McGovern and Willy Russell. They’re one of the reasons I’m an actor today. Steve has that quality, too. You can imagine him writingEducating Rita. He creates these magical worlds with humour, heart and human struggle. To be in his thought process when he writes is an honour. It’s the food that gives me life.” “The motivation for me is that he’s just so good,” says Knight. “If it’s possible to get Stephen into something, then I will, because I know he’s going to be fantastic.”Next up for the pair is the long-awaited Peaky Blinders film,The Immortal Man, which dons its razor-sharp cap and swaggers on to screens in March. “I’m not allowed to talk about it but it’s fucking brilliant,” Knight says proudly. “I’m so excited that it’s coming soon.” Graham reprises his role from the TV series as Liverpool dockyard union leader Hayden Stagg. “It was a total riot to make,” he says. “I don’t normally get to do the kind of things I do in this film, so I had a lot of fun.” What kind of things? “I can’t say, can I? You won’t catch me out!”Knight isnow writingthe screenplay for the next James Bond film. “I can’t say anything about that either. Apart from it’s a dream come true.” If he’s in the market for a scouse 007, he doesn’t need to look far. “I’d rather be a villain,” says Graham. “It’d be more fun.” Knight nods: “Every great actor that I’ve spoken to has said that. They’d all rather be the villain.”He’s also been working on the third series of BBC wartime rompSAS: Rogue Heroes. The drama has led to petitions in parliament to award maverick hero Blair “Paddy” Mayne (played by Jack O’Connell) a posthumous medal. “I’m 110% in support of the campaign to give Paddy the recognition he deserves,” says Knight. “His incredible courage, mental strength and battlefield intelligence helped turn a crucial chapter of the war in favour of Britain. There’s no logical reason not to acknowledge this.”Knight’s approach to period drama views society from the bottom up, not the top down. “Why wouldn’t you do it that way?” he says. “The best stories are in those places. In any taxi or Uber, the driver’s story will almost certainly be more interesting than the passenger’s. The themes of A Thousand Blows – poverty, migration, prejudice, family, ambition, the fight for survival – are just as relevant today. There’s loads more stories I’d like to tell. I want to do something about Shakespeare.”View image in fullscreenKnock out … Stephen Graham in A Thousand Blows, season one.Photograph: Disney+The pair are both frighteningly prolific. Are they the busiest men in showbiz? “Quite possibly!” laughs Graham. “It’s taken me 30 years to become an overnight success but that’s sweet. I adore what I do. I’m a grownup Mr Benn and I love it.”“Me too,” says Knight. “I’d sit down and write stuff even if nobody wanted me to. It doesn’t feel like an effort, it’s just putting it into words fast enough.” Knight didn’t write Peaky Blinders until his 50s. Does he wish he’d become a dramatist earlier? “I do, actually. It all goes back to class. It takes 20 years to recover from a working-class upbringing. It took me that long to believe I was as good as other people, if not better.” This chimes with Graham: “It took me ages to get rid of that imposter syndrome. It’s only dissipated completely in the past five years.”Hectic schedules permitting, will A Thousand Blows be back for round three? “Fingers crossed,” says Graham. “Steve has ideas for it that are next level! If the stars align, there could be a whopper on its way. That’s all I’ll say.” Knight is staying tight-lipped. “I refer you to the answer previously given by my honourable friend,” he smiles.I leave the Steves lamenting the fortunes of their respective football teams, Liverpool and Birmingham City. “We’re the only team in Europe who failed to score a goal during the reign of a pope,” says Knight. “That’s our proud boast.” Graham is delighted by this: “That’s an amazing stat! You’ve got to squeeze that into a script sometime.” You wouldn’t put it past him.A Thousand Blows is on Disney+ fromFriday9January.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioStephen GrahamDramaTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They talk about the vulnerability of singing, the cost of inhabiting a role – and rationing future partsByRyan GilbeyFri 2 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 10.29 ESTShareAll things considered, tellingPaul MescalI once placed a bet on him is not quite the icebreaker I had hoped. Or rather, it breaks the ice in an unusual way.“The key question,” he says, his voice betraying a hint of trepidation, “is what was the bet? Most Likely to Join the 27 Club?”Wow: that’s bleak – but funny. Josh O’Connor, who plays Mescal’s lover in the austere new wartime love story The History of Sound, certainly thinks so. Cosied up beside his co-star, he is overcome with appalled laughter.It’s true that Mescal was approaching 27 when I had that flutter on him three years ago. But far from betting that he would meet a premature end at the same tender age as Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain, I was throwing down my £25 in a flurry of excitement at his surprise Oscar nomination in 2023 for Charlotte Wells’sAftersun. He played a young father concealing his suicidal depression from his daughter while they are holidaying together in Turkey. His performance, like the film, is infinitely subtle and mysterious, its thrashing turmoil hidden beneath an opaque surface.“Sorry about the £25,” says Mescal, who lost to Brendan Fraser in The Whale. “But thanks for the vote of confidence.”It is an autumnal Saturday afternoon, and we are in a London hotel room. When I entered a few minutes earlier, the PR assistant steered me toward a seat at the other side of the room, far from the two actors. O’Connor, to his credit, having spotted that I had my hands full, sprang to his feet and helpfully dragged my chair closer to him and Mescal. Not for the last time, he gave the impression of being an extremely good boy.Mescal is equally affable but more puckish. There’s a flicker of danger about him: a carnivorous sexuality in contrast to the more wholesome O’Connor. Today, Mescal is wearing a tatty white T-shirt, the sleeves of which he keeps pushing up until you want to say: Yes, yes, great guns, very impressive, now put them away.View image in fullscreenO’Connor and  Mescal in The History of Sound.Photograph: Gwen Capistran/© Fair Winter LLC. All Rights ReservedA vaguely bad boy and maybe a goody-two-shoes, then. But they could scarcely seem more devoted to each other. Their tactility and body language is enough to make anyone nearby feel like a gooseberry. At any given moment during our conversation, one of them is usually angled toward the other, head cocked attentively; the only way they could get any closer is if one jumped into the other’s lap. O’Connor will occasionally snake an arm around the back of Mescal’s chair while his friend is speaking, or Mescal will give O’Connor’s arm or knee a reassuring squeeze. The message is clear: we are straight men who have played several gay roles, yet we are relaxed enough in ourselves not to recoil from intimacy.Right now, Mescal is reflecting on Aftersun while O’Connor, six years his senior and wearing a checked sweatshirt, listens closely. “The Oscars brought the opportunity to celebrate that film in a way that Charlotte and myself had never anticipated,” he says of what was, after all, only his second lead role since the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney’sNormal People, which made him a star. “You don’t make something like Aftersun and think: ‘I know wherewe’llbe going in 2023!’ I doubt that will ever be topped for me, because it’s not the sort of film that usually gets recognised in that capacity.”He’s right: Aftersun is almost an anti-Oscars movie. Even his one crying scene is played in semi-darkness with his back to the camera.“That film is quietly perfect,” sighs O’Connor, who has been friends with Mescal since video-calling him in 2020 to congratulate him on Normal People. “There’s no crescendo. We’re all so used to awards bait.”“The ‘reel’, they call it,” says Mescal, referring to the melodramatic film clips shown at awards ceremonies. “The Oscars reel. Jesus.” He sounds mildly disgusted.View image in fullscreenMescal in Aftersun.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyWe are meeting near the end of 2025 but it is already clear that there is unlikely to be an Oscars reel forThe History of Sound, despite their sensitive performances. Mescal plays Lionel, a singer raised on a farm in the American South, who falls for David (O’Connor), a playful and gifted musicologist. Separated when David goes off to fight in the first world war, they reunite for an expedition through rural Maine harvesting folk songs and recording them on wax cylinders.Among their current crop of films, The History of Sound is eclipsed in Mescal’s case byHamnet, in which he plays Shakespeare, and for O’Connor by the comic whodunitWake Up, Dead Man: A Knives Out Mysteryand the languid heist dramaThe Mastermind. Still, you can’t win ’em all, and The History of Sound is a film of which they are immensely proud. It is also one to which they both remained attached for four years while funding was being sought. “There were times when we thought it might not happen,” admits O’Connor. “But neither of us ever thought about dropping out.”Mescal came to the set straight from playing the hero in theGladiator sequel. “I was 90 kilos and I had eight weeks to get down to 78 kilos,” he grimaces. “It was a real headfuck. I loved the process of making that film but The History of Sound felt like home to me. It’s where I’m most comfortable. I want to make more films like that versus ones on the scale of Gladiator II.”The love story between Lionel and David would always have been intimate, but the presence of song (though this is no musical) adds an extra dimension. “One of the things I love about this film is that it tells a story of intimacy in a new way,” says O’Connor. “Irrespective of my own insecurities about my voice, singing is such a vulnerable act.”Mescal agrees. “I think the thrill comes from the vulnerability,” he says. “It’s like in Irish pubs, it’ll be bustling and then you’ll hear: ‘Shh-shhh.’ And that silence before someone opens their mouth to sing is deafening. You’re afraid to breathe.” Has he ever serenaded anyone? “I’ve sung songs to people. But I feel like ‘serenaded’ has a saccharine sound to it.”Eager to shift the focus away from his personal life, he says: “Josh had two bands!” O’Connor looks sheepish: “They were called Orange Output and Klang. I didn’t sing so much as shout in time.” Orange Output has gained minor notoriety as the band he formed to try to impress Tahliah Barnett, better known now as FKA twigs, after they appeared together in a production of Bugsy Malone at their private school in Cheltenham. When the story broke in 2023, she declared herself “very flattered”.The more musically confident of the pair, Mescal isabout to play Paul McCartney in Sam Mendes’s quartet of Beatles movies, due out in 2028. Those films will be golden oldies in petrol station bargain bins, however, by the time another of his current projects reaches the screen: Mescal is already several years into makingMerrily We Roll Along, an adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical that follows three friends backwards from their disillusioned 40s to their idealistic 20s. Rather than using ageing makeup, the director Richard Linklater (who took 12 years to shoot Boyhood in a similar fashion) is stretching the production over two decades. Pencil it in the diary for 2040.View image in fullscreenO’Connor in The Mastermind.Photograph: MUBI/PAOf the two of them, only Mescal has had songs written about him: word is that he is the subject of bothSidelines, by his ex-girlfriend Phoebe Bridgers, andNormal Thing, by his current partner Gracie Abrams. No such luck for O’Connor. “But Paul’s writing a song for me.” Really? “Well, I hope he is.” At that, Mescal starts warbling: “Josh O’Connorrr, the bestboyyy!” Hmm. There is a lot of emoting going on but no discernible tune. “God, it’s so catchy,” O’Connor fibs.He has said that he wanted to make The History of Sound partly so he could see up close how Mescal does what he does. So — what did he discover? “Well, it’s actually really easy,” he jokes. “No. Um. Well. There is something spiritual about what happens. When ‘action’ is called, and you look into your friend’s eyes and see something depart, and something else take its place, that is a very moving experience. Physically, the form is Paul. But emotionally, spiritually, he’s vacated. How he does that, fuck knows.”Mescal has his own compliment at the ready. “There’s such a generosity of spirit in Josh as a person. He extends that into a performance, sometimes to the detriment of his own well-being. That is an incredibly fucking generous thing to give people for a cinema-going experience. I wouldn’t say he is a method actor but that doesn’t mean he won’t experience the cost to the character because he has such empathy for them.”Does that ring true? “Yeah,” says O’Connor. “Our friend Jessie Buckley calls actors ‘soul collectors’. We learn something from the characters we play, and they never truly leave us. You can see that Aftersun has left an imprint on my friend here.” The same goes for O’Connor after playing Arthur, the white-suited, crypt-robbing treasure-hunter in Alice Rohrwacher’sLa Chimera. “There is a part of Arthur that I inhabit and that still inhabits me. And there is a cost to you by doing that. But Paul is right: there is something generous about being an actor. You put yourself into someone else’s mind, and that’s an empathetic act.”Then Mescal drops a bombshell disguised as an aside. “I’m five or six years into this now, and I feel very lucky. But I’m also learning that I don’t think I can go on doing it as much.” Is he talking about rationing himself? “I think so. I’m gonna have to start doing that. For sure.” A caveat follows: “Rationing doesn’t necessarily mean less.” Huh? “It means learning that films like The History of Sound take more out of the well. You can’t keep going back and expect to consistently deliver something you’re proud of. What that rationing looks like, I don’t know. I miss being on stage, so I might have a time when I’m only doing theatre for a couple of years. I also have different priorities in my personal life that I want to attend to.”View image in fullscreenMescal and O’Connor in The History of Sound.Photograph: Neon and Focus FeaturesThere must be mental health issues to consider, too. I can’t help thinking of the troubled David in The History of Sound, who speaks of the “false chord” he feels chiming inside him. Or Calum, the young father cornered and crumbling in Aftersun. They belong to a pattern of men unable to express or resolve what is plaguing them, whereas the actors themselves seem strikingly un-plagued. What’s their secret?“I don’t know the answer,” says O’Connor. “Being in your life, with your family, having privacy. You have to be in your life. The attention both of us give to taking care of these characters — well, if we went to half that trouble for ourselves in our own lives …” Mescal completes the thought: “We’d be therapists.”O’Connor likes the rationing idea. “I’m going to take some time off, too,” he decides. How to balance that with the imperative to stay visible and current? Step off the train and it will keep speeding along without you. “That’s the great fear,” says Mescal. “But what’s the alternative? I don’t want to resent the thing I love. This sounds bold, but I’d rather not be on the train if that is the choice.”“The nightmare is resenting the work,” O’Connor says. “Also, the more we see of an actor, the harder it is for that actor to pull the wool over your eyes and convince you they’re someone else.”Mescal is staring down the barrel of a months-long awards season campaign for Hamnet. “Once I’ve finished promoting that, I hope nobody gets to see me until 2028 when I’m doing the Beatles. People will get a break from me and I’ll get a break from them.”He could always keep a low profile until Merrily We Roll Along opens in 15 years or so.“Can you imagine?” he says, his eyes lighting up.O’Connor pictures the scene circa the early 2040s: “People will be, like: ‘Why did they cast that absolute nobody in this movie? Remember when he talked about rationing — and then no one ever saw him again?’”The History of Sound is in cinemas from 23 January.Explore more on these topicsPaul MescalJosh O'ConnorfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its scandalous story reveals much about the playwright and resonates freshlyMichael BillingtonFri 2 Jan 2026 07.44 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 08.37 ESTShareIhear on the grapevine that plans to name a London West End theatre after Terence Rattigan have temporarily stalled. An even better way to honour Rattigan is to revive his plays and the latest such revival is the rarely seen Man and Boy, which opens at theNational’s Dorfman theatreat the end of this month. The play had brief runs on Broadway and in London in 1963 withCharles Boyerin the lead and another outing in 2005 with David Suchet giving a mesmerising performance as “the man” of the title, a beleaguered Romanian financier, but to all intents and purposes this is an unknown Rattigan.I would suggest that it reveals a surprising amount about its author. The first thing to hit one is how much the play’s success or failure mattered to Rattigan himself. It was sparked by a book about the swindling Swedish financier Ivar Kreuger, whose business empire collapsed at the height of the Great Depression. Setting the action in 1934, Rattigan shows his hero, Gregor Antonescu, hiding out in his estranged son’s Greenwich Village apartment to which he lures the chair of American Electric in the hope of securing a life-saving merger. What is shocking is the ruthlessness with which Gregor exploits his son’s sexual charms.Equally astonishing is the normally diplomatic Rattigan’s belief that the play should be performed on his own terms or not at all. To him Gregor is “as evil as Iago” and when the play’s intended star, Rex Harrison, and director, Glen Byam Shaw, sought to soften the text and Laurence Olivier rejected the play for his opening Chichester season, Rattigan dug his heels in. The play mattered hugely to Rattigan because, with his theatrical reputation at its lowest ebbb thanks to the rise of a new Royal Court generation, he felt it was his last chance to prove he was a serious dramatist.View image in fullscreenTerence Rattigan … his own father’s scandal deeply affected his life and work.Photograph: Gordon Anthony/Getty ImagesBut there are more personal reasons behind Rattigan’s emotional investment. At heart, the play is a father-and-son drama and you only have to read the excellent biographies byMichael Darlowand Geoffrey Wansell to realise how crucial to Rattigan’s life and work was his own filial relationship. His father, Frank, was a career diplomat forced to resign after an affair with a Romanian princess: in many ways his father’s antithesis, Rattigan inherited his talent for pretence and belief in masked emotion.But he also used his work to explore the complexities of their relationship. He said ofAdventure Story, his play about Alexander the Great, that the hero’s “physical energy, strategic brilliance and determination were inspired by love of his father”. Conversely in Who Is Sylvia? – written a year later, in 1950 – the sexually voracious hero who stays resolutely married is a thinly disguised portrait of philandering Frank. By the time we get to Man and Boy, Rattigan bases the whole work on a tangled father-son relationship full of social and political antagonism and interdependence.Yet another thread running through the play is that of homosexuality and it is fascinating how often Rattigan, the most discreet of men in relation to sexual disclosure, returns to the theme. David Hare once persuaded me that Crocker-Harris, the schoolmaster hero of Rattigan’sThe Browning Version, is a shrewdly manipulative figure who always ends up with his wife’s lovers. Rattigan’s Alexander the Great enjoys an implicitly gay relationship with his confidant, Hephaestion. In Table Number Seven, the second half ofSeparate Tables, the residents of a private hotel rally to the defence of a bogus major accused of sexual importuning. Initially couched in hetero terms, the major’s lapse is clearly a metaphor for cottaging and it is greatly to Rattigan’s credit that in 1954, three years before the Wolfenden report advocated that “homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence”, he saw a shift in public attitudes.But while Man and Boy was clearly of huge importance to Rattigan, does it matter to us? Audiences will judge for themselves, but it is hard not to see in it intimations of more recent scandals. One inevitably thinks of Robert Maxwell, the Czech-born media mogul who misappropriated the Mirror’s pension fund and who died in mysterious circumstances. His daughter, Ghislaine, was the accomplice of the American financier Jeffrey Epstein, convicted of child sexual abuse offences.The sins of Rattigan’s Gregor are less rank but, while he is heartless, exploitative and dishonest, he has a dynamism and drive that make him – not unlike Lambert Le Roux in David Hare and Howard Brenton’s Pravda – theatrically compelling. Rattigan has grasped the central paradox of drama: that we are fascinated by monsters as long as they embody William Blake’s maxim that “energy is eternal delight”.Man and Boy is at theNational Theatre, London, 30 January to 14 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreTerence RattiganNational TheatreDavid SuchetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For classic rock collective Hardwicke Circus, it was a no-brainer: ‘We thought they’d like to hear some rock’n’roll’Fri 2 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 10.05 ESTShareIt is late October and, 10 kilometres from the frontline in Donetsk, eastUkraine, the inhabitants of a reconditioned ambulance are completely lost. While opening your phone and logging on to a maps app might appear the obvious solution, this would be extremely unwise here: Russian drones are overhead and hunting for any signals.Inside the van are a motley crew: an 81-year-old Irish music industry veteran; a 72-year-old Texas rocker; an Australian keyboardist; a Ukrainian saxophonist; and three twenty-something musicians from Carlisle, Cumbria. Their destination is a military base where they are to perform for Ukrainian troops.Dave Robinson, the Irishman, likens the wayward nature of the tour to when he was managing Jimi Hendrix in 1968. Joe “King” Carrasco, the ebullient Texan, compares it to “playing for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua when they were fighting the Contras”. For the younger, less experienced inhabitants of the ambulance, though, it is a mighty long way from Carlisle and Melbourne to this bleak, chilly no man’s land.“We were more excited than anything,” reflects Jonny Foster, lead singer and guitarist of Hardwicke Circus – now safely back home in Carlisle – as he, alongside Robinson and Carrasco, discuss over a video call what it was like to traverse these real highways to hell. “We just wanted to do our bit to support Ukraine’s war effort and thought the locals might enjoy hearing a live rock’n’roll band.”Hardwicke Circus toured war-torn Ukraine in June of this year, the only British musicians to have done so. The experience made them determined to return, thus their late October-early November trek. The band didn’t undertake these tours to generate money – all proceeds were donated to local Ukrainian charities – nor as a publicity stunt. “We once toured British prisons,” says Foster, “for the same reason: we believe music is both entertainment and art, and all people should have access to it.”View image in fullscreenLiving on the frontline … Hardwicke Circus and their new fans in Ukraine.Photograph: Veronika ZolotoverkhaTeenage brothers Jonny and Tom Foster formed Hardwicke Circus in 2015, and since then have self-released three albums, plus a live-in-Ukraine LP, One Hour Ahead of the Posse. Their classic rock sound might not be fashionable – their sax-accompanied narrative songs suggest Thin Lizzy or mid-1970s era Bruce Springsteen – but regular touring has seen them gather a loyal following. Paul McCartneyasked for Glastonbury to add them to its 2022 lineup(they closed that year’s festival playing the Rabbit Hole stage to a rapturous audience) while Bob Dylan added them to the bill of his Hyde Park concert in 2019.The Fosters were inspired to tour Ukraine after performing in the Czech Republic earlier this year. “We were naive,” admits Jonny, “and thought Ukraine was a short drive over the Czech border – it’s 1,000km across Poland! Back in Carlisle we contacted Derek Eland, a Cumbrian painter who had done a lot to support Ukraine. He linked us with Okazia, a female rock trio in Ukraine, and we approached them about playing dates together. They loved the idea and it became the quickest tour we’ve ever booked!”Remarkably the band weren’t warned off the trip by the UK Foreign Office. “We were waiting to hear someone shout ‘Don’t go!’” says Robinson, “but nobody did. People think we’re mad as a box of snakes” – he laughs – “and maybe we are.”Still they did hit a snag: Hardwicke Circus’s non-Foster members refused to tour Ukraine. “Four of our band got scared,” says Foster, “and their mums forbade them to go.”“Which is understandable,” adds Robinson.“Yeah,” agrees Foster, “Saying, ‘Do you want to come and play in a war zone for no money?’ isn’t appealing to most people.”We knew we weren’t going to end the war, but seeing people sing along, the tension draining from their faces, made it worthwhileInstead the brothers reached out to former member Bill Wilde and Australian keyboardist Conor Morrissey – both London-based – who subsequently signed on. Also joining on guitar was Carrasco, a Tex-Mex musician who has dedicated his life to rocking all over the world. “I started playing in bands as a teenager,” he recalls, “and since then I’ve played everywhere – all over Latin America, Botswana, Zimbabwe, India, Cambodia, Morocco.”The Carrasco connection came via the band’s manager, Dave Robinson, a music industry veteran who is best known for co-founding and managing Stiff Records, the London-based indie label that launched Elvis Costello, Ian Dury, Kirsty MacColl, the Pogues and Madness (who Robinson signed after they played his wedding, then directed their groundbreaking videos).Stiff released Joe “King” Carrasco’s eponymous 1980 album, which failed to match the success of the aforementioned artists. “Joe’s always been a brilliant performer and total rock’n’roller,” says Robinson. “The UK wasn’t ready for him in 1980, but this didn’t faze him.”Carrasco did get a taste of US success: having signed to MCA, he found his videos were played on the fledgling MTV channel, while Michael Jackson sang backing vocals on his 1982 album Synapse Gap (Mundo Total). “We were both recording at the same Hollywood studio complex. Michael was a nice guy who had incredible mic technique,” Carrasco says. “He had a white Rolls-Royce and there were all these teen girls hanging around his car. Michael seemed perplexed by it all.”Carrassco’s brush with fame proved fleeting, ensuring he continued playing bars and touring where most acts never ventured. Robinson invited him to join his youthful charges playing UK dates in 2022. “Great band, in it for all the right reasons,” Carrasco says of Hardwicke Circus.“When Joe heard we were planning to tour Ukraine he said: ‘Count me in’,” says Foster. “He’s really committed to singing for the people.”“And I’m committed to dogs,” adds Carrasco: having discovered in June how Ukraine is now home to many abandoned canines, he subsequently raised funds to buy large amounts of pet food for animal shelters. “We took pet food to one dog shelter just three kilometres from the frontline,” he says. “Here we could feel the intensity of the struggle – that this conflict is a war between good and evil – with the Russians and North Koreans very nearby.”The June tour of Ukraine, which saw the band play eight dates from Lviv in the west to Kharkiv in the north-east, was, all three agree, life-affirming. “We knew we weren’t going to end the war,” says Robinson, “but seeing people smile and sing along, the tension draining from their faces, that made it worthwhile. “Our most popular number was one we’d originally written about Tyson Fury but, for the tour, we changed it to be about Oleksandr Usyk.”Afternoon acoustic concerts in hospitals and schools added another dimension to the tour. “We wanted to bring some light relief to people who have been through so much,” says Foster. “One afternoon we played a set at an amputee hospital and there, lying on a stretcher, was a soldier who had recently had his left leg amputated – blood was seeping through his bandages. He was singing along with us and applauding. That was incredibly moving.”At another venue, a school workshop, they met an autistic teenage girl who was traumatised from having lived for a long period under Russian occupation. ”She really responded when we played music. So much so that we invited her to sing with us, Her teacher later said that our performance saw her begin coming out of her shell.”The impact the June tour made on Hardwicke Circus ensured that they were determined to do it again. “We considered waiting until winter was over,” says Robinson, “but thought: No, let’s show our support now. And off we went.”This time the tour involved plenty of prep: the support of several Carlisle businesses and general fundraising saw the purchase of two emergency evacuation vehicles to donate to the Ukrainian military. Leaving Carlisle, it took the band five days to drive the SUVs, alongside a band van – “Jonny had bought a complete banger for tuppence,” notes Robinson – to Lviv, where warning signs of the forthcoming eastern winter greeted them. “It was getting really cold, heavy rains, and the Russians were doing their worst before winter really kicks in,” he says.An early incident almost ended the tour – and their lives. “I was driving down a steep mountain road on a very wet night,” recalls Robinson, “and the van’s steering lost power. I had to make a snap decision, so drove into a forest road. When we got out we saw we were on the verge of a 200-metre drop. If we’d gone over that we would’ve joined Buddy Holly in rock’n’roll heaven.”With the group’s van now unsafe to drive, Adrian Simpson, a British national whose organisation Mission Aid For Ukraine had provided advice and support, stepped in. “Adrian lent us a reconditioned ambulance,” says Robinson, “and, as we were heading to Donetsk, he advised us to remove the red crosses as Russian drones seek out ambulances – it’s fucking immoral what Putin’s doing. So I got out my penknife and scratched them off.”Touring meant sirens going off, hotels with bunkers, being woken by explosions. It was intense and an incredible timeHardwicke Circus could have left the SUVs in Lviv to be collected, but instead they were determined to deliver the vehicles to military bases near the frontline. And to sing for the soldiers. “We wanted to show our solidarity with those who were doing the fighting,” says Foster. “When we delivered a vehicle to the 81st Brigade it was one of those ‘lost for words’ moments. We’d spent months fundraising and here we were giving the vehicle over to those who needed it. They signed our British flag and we signed their Brigade flag and it was all very emotional.”Travelling by ambulance proved handy as Robinson soon succumbed to pneumonia. “I woke up in hospital not knowing where I was,” he says, “and they kept me there a week. Worst food I’ve ever eaten – but they fixed me.” After eight days recuperating he travelled to Kraków in Poland and then home.The band’s bassist Wilde, meanwhile, had such bad flu that he couldn’t feel his limbs and was put on a coach to Poland. Not long after, the band’s Ukrainian saxophonist Ptashka Khromchenko needed to be hospitalised for bronchitis. The Foster brothers and keyboardist Morrissey came down with flu, meaning only Carrasco, veteran of so many tours, remained unscathed.“The weather was bitter and we were playing concerts in hospitals so picked up viruses,” says Foster. “We soldiered on – when you’re in a nation under attack you don’t complain about feeling poorly.”The concerts – held in Ternopil, Cherkasy, Dnipro, Poltava and Kyiv – were often held in subterranean venues and had to finish before the midnight curfew, and drew largely female audiences, as most men are on the frontline.“Touring meant sirens going off, staying in hotels with bunkers, hearing missiles and drones above us, being woken by explosions,” says Robinson who, even after being hospitalised, felt emboldened. “It was intense and an incredible time.”“It was dangerous, yes,” says Foster, “and there is no guide book, but we have a lot of info we can share if people want to take their art to Ukraine.”“That’s what people in the west need to do,” says Robinson. “Get out there and support Ukrainians. See how they conduct their lives during wartime.”‘For now, music is a weapon’: the Ukrainian musicians playing on as an act of resistanceRead more“Ukrainians fight hard and don’t take no shit,” says Carrasco. “They sleep in their bathtubs to avoid being sprayed with broken glass and don’t complain. Instead, they get up each morning and fight on. Alamo spirit!”After 18 days touring Ukraine and seeing this spirit, it was time for Hardwicke Circus’s surviving members to head home. After instructing the rest of the band to follow Robinson in flying out of Kraków, Foster stayed on to collect their now semi-repaired van. Packing it with band equipment, he drove for five days back to Carlisle.“I kind of collapsed when I got home,” he says. “Exhaustion – I’d driven a five-and-a-half-thousand-mile round trip! But it was worth it. And we all aim on returning to Ukraine in 2026.”“More touring without a safety net,” says Robinson. The three veterans of Hardwicke Circus’s Ukraine campaign all laugh in recognition.Hardwicke Circus continue to fundraise for Ukraine atcrowdfunder.co.uk/p/hardwicke-circusExplore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

She decided to post online about the microaggressions she had endured while appearing in a play some years before, making peace with the fact that it could affect her chances at future roles, and shaking as she typed out the thread. A day passed, “and I just heard my phone goingding, ding, ding.I was convinced it was going to be backlash – but it was people sending their congratulations.” Ikumelo had been nominated for a Bafta for her short, Brain in Gear. “I felt like God was going: ‘Don’t worry.’ It was a beautiful moment.”She won that Baftaand has since scooped another. “When I won the first one, I was living in a small flat, and I felt like the [statuette] was judging me,” she laughs. “I was like, I might have to refurb or move. Now I have an office, so they’re in a very reasonable place.”You get the feeling she should keep a few shelves free. After flirting with TV roles in the US, in 2025 Ikumelo joined the writing and acting cast of NBC’s Office spinoff The Paper. Closer to home, she also shot another series of the show that scooped her the second of those aforementioned awards, for best female comedy performance – the riotous buddy cop comedyBlack Ops(she is still hopeful her brilliantly anxiety-inducing Brain in Gear will make it to a series).We meet just before an early screening of Black Ops, where the first two episodes prompt a stream of gasps and giggles from the audience. Afterwards, Ikumelo says to the crowd: “It’s kind of funny, isn’t it?!” If her rise seems swift, it has been underpinned by years of graft on stage (“Theatre was the guy who refused to marry me … we were living together for 20 years”) and now on screen. Her breakout TV role came in comedian Dane Baptiste’sSunny Da decade ago. Ikumelo then gave her funny bones a workout by writing and starring in another BBC series, the irreverent sketch showFamalam. She remembers the first time she was recognised in the wild. “I was in a play and I was having my little sad lunch outside,” she says. “Some random guy just goes: ‘You finished with that?’ And I went: ‘Oh – did you want it?’” It took her a second to realise he wasn’t asking for her leftovers, but rather riffing off the catchphrase uttered by her character Fat Sam, a chicken-obsessed schoolboy.Black Ops – co-created with Famalam alumnus Akemnji Ndifornyen and writers Joe Tucker and Lloyd Woolf – has seen her further hone her talent for creating and embodying hapless but endearing characters. A thrilling and very silly crime caper about two inexperienced, unsuitable police community support officers forced to go undercover, much of its magic comes from the chemistry between its leads, Dom (Ikumelo) and Kay, played by Hammed Animashaun (Pls Like, The Wheel of Time). “He’s energy on legs!” says Ikumelo. “I’m a bit more introverted, and I can be a curmudgeon. So he does his best work, but he also makes me domybest work.”View image in fullscreenChemistry … Dom (Ikumelo) and Kay (Hammed Animashaun) in the new series of Black Ops.Photograph: BBC/Ricky DarkoSeries one saw the duo thrown into the treacherous underworld of the Brightmarsh gang, presided over by Tevin (Ndifornyen). This time around, they have only gone and got themselves a promotion to MI5. Once again, the series cleverly highlights the gulf between their lives as intrepid crime fighters and their very ordinary – and in the case of Dom, middle-class – existence. While shows such as Top Boy have made urban decay a sexy export, Ikumelo saw a gap in the market for something that operates with a lighter touch, and which diversifies the kinds of Black characters we see on screen. “In terms of what it is to be a Londoner, particularly a Black Londoner, I think it’s important to challenge that,” she says. “Dom is like, I live in De Beauvoir! I don’t know anything about gangs.” Not that the show forgets the hypocrisy of how racedoesaffect who gets in trouble with the law. In season one, Ikumelo recalls: “We realise that there is a deeper world – the gang is serving a bigger, more upper-middle-class auteur.” By contrast, season two sees Kay ushered towards a knife amnesty box as he returns his uniform to the police station.The thrust of the series is a plot to bring down Notting Hill carnival, as orchestrated by a charming spy named Steve (Outlander’s Ed Speleers) who, says Ikumelo, is “so charismatic and suave, you want to hang on his every word”. Cathy Tyson – enjoying a welcome renaissance of late in dramas such as Blue Lights and Boiling Point – joins the cast, too, in a bit of dream casting for Ikumelo. The emotional core of the show, though, remains Dom and Kay (“they’ve evolved into actual friends, there’s a partnership. And that gets tested in some ways,” says Ikumelo, trying to avoid capital-S spoilers). Even as her star continues to rise, it is clear she has a soft spot for making excellent, homegrown comedy. “I love the real workhorse culture they have [in the US],” she says. “But I always miss the rain and the grey, and the cold, damp air. With this show, I’m on home turf … I feel like I’m at my house.”The new series of Black Ops starts on BBC One on 8 January.Explore more on these topicsTelevision2026 culture previewTV comedyComedyGbemisola IkumelointerviewsShareReuse this content"

Maybe it’s the “f” sound on “five.” But 2026 is one step beyond, and it’s where we are now, with every science-fiction-style development – principally the widespread adoption of AI – looking dystopian, or maybe worse. (Doesn’t it feel like in a proper dystopia, the brain-numbing corporate-backed anti-human technology would actually work a bit better?) Didn’t anyone warn us about this?The answer, at least with regards to oursci-fi moviesyears ago (or occasionally months ago) positioned in 2026, is yes and no. Some of those warnings are broadly applicable (global catastrophe) but specifically far-fetched (when mankind is inevitably decimated, we will almost certainly take the ape population with us). Some of them are visionary; others just look like bad green screen. But it’s worth examining where various film-makers, from geniuses to grunts, thought we would be situated by this time in our planet’s evolution. So let’s take a look at some of the movies that have been set in 2026 over the years and see if they have anything to teach us.DoomView image in fullscreenPhotograph: REUTERSWell, this doesn’t bode well. According to the video game adaptation Doom, whose 20th anniversary was recently celebrated by no one, 2026 is the year that humanity discovers a portal to an ancient city on Mars, where the people of Earth are able to establish a research facility. Now, the bad stuff – in terms of plot and in terms of garish cinematic imitations of a first-person-shooter video game – doesn’t really go down for another 20 years in the future, so even if we do discover a portal to Mars this year, we might have some time to avoid true disaster. If we did discover a portal to an ancient Martian city, it’s genuinely difficult to tell whetherElon Muskwould still be super-psyched to send everyone to Mars or would instantly become dejected that the portal wasn’t something he personally paid for, allowing him to claim messianic ownership for mankind’s expansion into the stars. That’s before we even get to the harvesting of Martian chromosomes and subsequent mutations into horrific creatures. (Again, this is closer to 2046, not to be confused with the Wong Kar-Wai film.) In general, Doom is – if nothing else – a good test case for why, exactly, we let Mars become a stretch-goal hope for humanity. Whether in John Carpenter’s chintzy space-westernGhosts of Mars, the more grounded sci-fi ofRed Planet, or the woo-woo mysticism of Mission to Mars, our distant neighbor planet doesn’t tend to serve as a beacon of hope. If anyone wants to make that dubious red-planet real estate sale, maybe they should start with at least making the fantasy version look good.The Marvel DregsView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jessica Miglio/Courtesy of Marvel StudiosOne of the goofiest quirks of the current Marvel Cinematic Universe is how to account for the various world-threatening cataclysms, including a five-year time jump whose events are largely undepicted in the films themselves, the movies have become like a clock radio perpetually running a few minutes fast – only instead of minutes, it’s years. So there’s a whole bunch of Marvel stuff that various wikis helpfully explain to be taking place in 2026. The good ones, such asGuardians of the Galaxy Vol 3and the underrated rompThe Marvels, take place far away from Earth, so they feel pretty unmoored from our sense of time. But the bad stuff is some of the worst Marvel has ever produced: the nonsensically meandering TV showSecret Invasionand the Zoom-call farce ofAnt Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Judging by this stuff, we’re in for a whole lot of frustrating wheel-spinning in 2026, including the accompanying spin that actually, this nonsensical crap unfolding in front of us is essential to whatever happens next. Even worse, in the real world that assertion will probably prove correct.Dawn of the Planet of the ApesView image in fullscreenPhotograph: APHanging around: how Planet of the Apes became Hollywood’s most resilient franchiseRead moreMost of the original five-moviePlanet of the Apescycle is set in the further-flung future of Earth, but the new trilogy that began with 2011’sRise of the Planet of the Apesstarts closer to home, starting its timeline around 2016. So by the time a virus that knocks out most of Earth’s human population has done its damage, and also boosted the intelligence of apes, it’s only 2026, with further human indignities (and simian triumphs) to come. The end-credits sequence of Rise, illustrating how rapidly this virus spreads around the world and set around 2019, looks downright eerie in the wake of the real-world pandemic that would dawn in 2020. By comparison, the movieDawnlooks more abstract; if you can believe it, we’re already six years out from the spread of Covid-19, and humanity, though obviously wounded by the still-spreading virus, hasn’t been annihilated, and our technology certainly hasn’t been knocked out. But this bleakest of the four contemporary Apes movies (at least so far!) still has a substantial bummer in store, suggesting that human and/or ape nature, whatever qualifies as either, will inevitably lead to violent conflict, no matter the work of the best-intentioned among us. We’re at the mercy of those who appeal to others’ worst instincts, even if those instincts don’t represent the majority. Right now, it feels hard to argue with that, even though we probably should.MetropolisView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Moviestore/REX/ShutterstockThe 50 best movies of 2025 in the USRead moreBy far the most prominent depiction of 2026 in cinema is from a movie close to celebrating its centennial. Fritz Lang’s silent classicMetropolistakes place in a futuristic city where rich businessmen lord over the skyscrapers as workers toil underground on the machines that keep everything running. Rich surface resident Freder, scion of the city’s ruler, has his eyes opened to these massive social gaps when he becomes obsessed with Maria, an underground organizer who preaches a coming together of the two halves of the Metropolis. A scientist with more radical plans creates a robot in her likeness, hoping to bring the whole of Metropolis down in flames. Here, a robot designed to imitate a human isn’t a tool of the ruling corporate class, but someone who wants to see them destroyed; it’s one element inverted by reality in a future that otherwise seems to be well on its way. Metropolis also imagines a world where technology depends on old-fashioned manual labor, which seems like a most logical union of rightwing disdain for “unskilled workers” and corporate enthusiasm for an AI bubble. It hasn’t yet come to pass, but it’s easy to picture some somewhat less stylish-looking version of Lang’s city expanding out with the promise of a return to manufacturing. The trickier, harder-to-imagine feat is the ending of the film, where the gap between the haves and the have-nots is bridged with love; not so much with specific policies. Like Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, the movie pleads for coexistence; unlike Dawn, it seems optimistic about the possibility that such coexistence could be possible. Given how the billionaire class (or even the less rarified millionaire class) reacts to any suggestion that they should step closer to the needs of the less fortunate, the idea that facing any degree of extremism might chasten them seems fantastical now – more so than it did a century ago. The robot, the caves of toil, the shimmering skyscrapers ... that all seems plausible enough. For rebalancing economic gaps to seem likely, we might have to wait another year. Or hundred.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsMarvelMetropolisDawn of the Planet of the ApesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I think it was pre-school. My mother was not always a patient teacher, and I was often a slow learner, but the scene, the tableaux, in memory, has the serenity of an icon.My favourite book growing upRosemary Sutcliff’sThe Eagle of the Ninth. It’s a story set in Roman Britain; the Eagle is the lost standard of the ninth legion. I was a boy already obsessed by all things Ancient Roman (the alternative to the kind of boy obsessed with dinosaurs). One of the places I remember reading it is in bed with my dad. On Sunday mornings my brother and I would climb into the big bed. My parents had long since split up. There was a picture on the wall, a modest reproduction of Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. To me, this voluptuous woman gazing at herself in a mirror was my mother. It’s interesting to me how the setting in which you read is such an integral part of the reading experience.The book that changed me as a teenagerI wasn’t quite a teenager (I was 12) and it’s not quite a book, but it definitely changed me. The end of the summer term at school, there was an outdoor production of Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. I was Cobweb, one of Titania’s fairy servants. The play was performed at dusk. All around us, Wiltshire fields and Wiltshire woodland. The atmosphere poured into me: two worlds touching; the overwhelming richness of the language. No doubt the feeling was partly shaped by anticipation of the long holiday. Also, of course, by being a pubescent boy. Theatre is sexy, always.The writer who changed my mindAlbert Camus,The Myth of Sisyphus– his inquiry into why, given the absurdity of life, you might not choose suicide. I was 18, not remotely suicidal, but wanting to be cleverer and a bit French. (These are not despicable ambitions.) And Camus is very cool. These days he would be sponsored by a company making raincoats. His “philosophy” is that of Polish cavalry preparing to charge German tanks. One is to be stylish. One does not make a fuss. One notices everything. One does not imagine that anything can be saved.Amor fati.The book that made me want to be a writerThis is an easy one.The RainbowbyDH Lawrence. We were reading it for A-level. I found the book overwhelming. I felt I was being shown Life. All my own yearning as a 17-year-old (one who was very much in love) was spoken to by this somewhat cantankerous son of a Nottinghamshire miner. The final scenes of the novel forced me on to my feet. I was madly excited. I could think of no better way to spend a life than trying to create something like this myself. It’s worth keeping in mind the shocking fact that in 1915 The Rainbow was censored, and more than 1,000 copies of it were burned. OK to send young men to die like flies in France, but a whisper of sex … No, thank you.The book or author I came back toAs a DH Lawrence fan, I allowed myself to be influenced by the Cambridge critic FR Leavis who (in my understanding) seemed to suggest that if you were for Lawrence you couldn’t be forJoyce. Lawrence was morally serious; Joyce was not. Out of loyalty to Lawrence it took me years to get to Joyce, and it wasn’t until I readDubliners, and specifically The Dead, that I saw what should have been obvious – you don’t have to choose. Hugely different personalities, both precious.Theauthor I rereadRecently I’ve been rereadingEM Forster. I’m not sure what sparked that. I reread them all (with the exception of A Passage to India). I was immensely impressed. He communicates a deep sanity in his novels, and an urgent and still very relevant call to emotional maturity and openness.Where Angels Fear to Tread– early and quite slight – is a big favourite. All his themes are there. Also,A Room With a View. He’s an author whose strong, calm voice – never shrill – we need to hear more of.The book I could never read againCountless. All those thrillers that hung around the house (and that I thoroughly enjoyed as a young teen): Desmond Bagley, Hammond Innes, Alistair MacLean, Ian Fleming. I admire them, their professionalism, their craftsmanship. But to read them again would be like struggling back into my school uniform.Theauthor I discovered later in lifePenelope Fitzgerald. I knew nothing about her until my mid-30s. The first book of hers I read was the last she wrote:The Blue Flower. Thrillingly strange, sometimes very funny, it is, I think, an obvious masterpiece – fragments from the life of an 18th-century German poet who died while still very young. She brought to it a whole long life’s worth of understanding and insight. It’s a portrait of various kinds of madness, but a saner book you won’t find.The book I am currently readingDominion by Tom Holland: a history of Christianity and how it has shaped the culture to the extent that it’s almost invisible (we are the goldfish, says Holland, and Christianity is the water we swim in). I’m very grateful to him. I know more, and am rethinking some of my lazy assumptions. Alongside it, I’m rereadingElizabeth Bishop’scollectedpoems. Nothing flashy about her stuff. Just the calm authority of one who knew, with pen in hand, exactly what she was doing. She used to be somewhat in Robert Lowell’s shadow, but not any more; a poet’s poet (like Marianne Moore, whom she knew well). What seems at first wry and ironic, appears, on rereading, more like heartbreak.My comfort readReally, what I’d like are my old Tintin albums. But where are they? Did I give them away? Hergé is a slightly controversial figure. He didn’t cover himself in glory during the war. I think Tintin and Captain Haddock might not approve of him. But as boys, my brother and I couldn’t get enough of it.The Land in Winter by Andrew Miller is published by Sceptre. To support the Guardian, buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Here’s your complete guide to 2026’s unmissable televisionByStuart Heritage,Kate AbbottandPhil HarrisonFri 2 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 13.34 ESTShareWaiting for the OutAs the writer of conspiracy thriller Utopia and Covid-era relationship drama Together, Dennis Kelly has form for creating darkly perceptive TV drama. This excellent series stars Josh Finan (whose performance in The Responder earned him a Bafta nomination) as Dan, a philosophy teacher with a troubled family past, working in a prison. As he explores issues around freedom, luck and destiny with the inmates, he starts to wonder if he actually belongs behind bars like his abusive father. Soon, his anxieties threaten to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.BBC One, 3 JanuaryCan You Keep a Secret?View image in fullscreenStaying alive … Dawn French and Mark Heap in Can You Keep a Secret?Photograph: BBC/Big Talk Studios/Alistair HeapDawn French has made a new sitcom, which in itself should be cause for celebration. However, Can You Keep a Secret? is written by Simon Mayhew-Archer (producer of This Country and Funboys) and revolves around a couple trying to cope with the windfall they receive when one of them is mistakenly pronounced dead, which is even better. And Mark Heap is in it too. This one could be brilliant.BBC One, 7 JanuaryBlack OpsView image in fullscreenUndercover … Gbemisola Ikumelo and Hammed Animashaun in Black Ops.Photograph: BBC/Ricky DarkoThefirst seasonof this comedy mined belly laughs from institutional racism, starring Gbemisola Ikumelo and Hammed Animashaun as a pair of Black community support officers talked into infiltrating a drug gang. Season two takes things up a notch: Dom and Kay are now working for MI5. It’s not as glamorous as it sounds though – although their admin jobs soon liven up when they’re approached by charismatic spy Steve. What follows finds a perfect balance between espionage and hilarity.BBC One, 8 JanuaryHeated RivalryView image in fullscreenBringing sexy back … Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie in Heated Rivalry.Photograph: Sabrina Lantos/HBOIs ice hockey the sexiest sport on Earth?This showmakes a strong case. Within minutes of meeting, ice-rink nemeses Ilya Rozanov and Shane Hollander are getting it on. And with its near-constant and incredibly raunchy sex scenes, Heated Rivalry is so horny it’s already got certain circles up in arms in the US. Perhaps this is what we all deserve, though: some TV that puts the puck in pucker up.Sky/Now, 10 JanuaryIndustryIt’s all change in this brilliantlybrutal thrillerset in the world of high finance. The departure of Harry Lawtey’s Robert seems to have triggered a reset, so there will be a flurry of new characters led by Whitney Halberstram (Max Minghella), the founder of a flashy payment processing company. Advance reports describe him as “a tornado of cut-throat ambition” so he should fit in just fine. Fans of continuity will be relieved to hear that Harper and Yasmin are still around and creating chaos wherever they go.BBC One, 11 JanuaryA Knight of the Seven KingdomsView image in fullscreenPeter Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms.Photograph: HBO“It’s a hedge knight. It’s like a knight but … sadder.” ThisGame of Thronesprequel leans into the undercurrent of sly humour that always existed within the original. The hedge knight in question is Ser Duncan the Tall (former Irish rugby union player and first-time actor Peter Claffey), an intrepid but hapless adventurer whose eagerness to earn his spurs isn’t always matched by his ability. Look out for plenty of embryonic origin stories, as ancient members of the Houses Targaryen and Baratheon start to establish bloody rivalries.Sky Atlantic/Now, 18 JanuaryHow to Get to Heaven from BelfastView image in fullscreenVoyage of discovery … Sinead Keenan, Caoilfhionn Dunne and Roisin Gallagher in How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.Photograph: Christopher Barr/NetflixHow do you follow a generational classic? Lisa McGee is sticking to home territory for this eight-part comedy drama. LikeDerry Girls, it focuses on a tight-knit group of friends: Saoirse, Robyn and Dara embark on a funny, scary adventure prompted by news of the death of a schoolmate. The brilliance of Derry Girls lay in its ability to find constant comedy and humanity in darkness and danger. This voyage of discovery looks set to repeat the trick.Netflix, FebruaryEuphoriaView image in fullscreenUnforgettable … Zendaya as Rue in Euphoria.Photograph: HBOSet five years down the line, Rue (Zendaya) is now in Mexico and seriously indebted to drug honcho Laurie, Jules (Hunter Schafer) is in art school and Nate and Cassie (Jacob Elordi and Sydney Sweeney) are miserable but about to get married. Sam Levinson’sscandalous high-school epichas been remarkable as both a hit-maker – basically everyone is an A-lister! – and a headline generator. This time, music’s golden girl Rosalía joins the cast. Let’s hope it’s just as unforgettable away from the melee of hormones and horror that is the high-school environment, eh.HBO Max, AprilMalcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair!After his world-conquering stint on Breaking Bad,Bryan Cranstoncould pick any project he liked. And that project was a revival of Malcolm in the Middle, the 00s teen sitcom in which he played an ostentatiously panicky dad. Given that Cranston’s performance in the original was truly exceptional, these four new episodes should be worth the wait.Disney+, 10 AprilMargo’s Got Money TroublesView image in fullscreenA total scream … Elle Fanning in Margo’s Got Money Troubles.Photograph: Allyson Riggs/Courtesy of AppleDavid E Kelley, the long-reigning king of TV’s most covetable trash fromAlly McBealtoThe Undoing, adapts this novel about a hard-up woman who finds her fortune on OnlyFans. Elle Fanning stars as Margo, Nick Offerman plays her ex-wrestler dad Jinx Millet and Michelle Pfeiffer (Kelley’s real-life wife) plays her mum, Shyanne. It’s sure to be a total scream.Apple TV, 15 AprilAmandalandIt is now fair to call Amanda Hughes the Frasier Crane of Motherland. In that show, she was a one-dimensional villain – selfish, aloof, oblivious – but last year’sAmandalanddeepened her into something far more complicated. If the new series is able to continue this pattern, Lucy Punch’s character will become the tragicomic heroine of an entire generation.BBCArmy of ShadowsRonan Bennett follows his hits such as Top Boy and The Day of the Jackal by updating this second world war classic – and placing it in a near-future Britain that has been invaded by America. We follow the burgeoning British resistance fighters who are trying to keep their country intact … and get their freedom back. Explosive stuff.Channel 4A Woman of SubstanceThe ultimate rags-to-riches romp! Brenda Blethyn and Jessica Reynolds star as older and younger versions of Emma Harte, who goes from housemaid to business mogul … then one of the richest woman in the world in the 1980s. The last time Channel 4 showed this drama, based on Barbara Taylor Bradford’s book, 13.8 million people tuned in, instantly making it the broadcaster’s biggest drama ever. They’ve still never hit those giddy heights again. Can they double down?Channel 4BaitBait was created and written by its star,Riz Ahmed. The story of a struggling actor on the verge of a big career breakthrough, it is “easily the most personal thing I’ve ever done”, he has said. However, it is also about what happens when a trippy conspiracy theory throws you into an existential crisis, which might be why he also said: “Maybe I should have just done therapy.”Prime VideoBabiesView image in fullscreenTender and melancholy … Babies.Photograph: BBC/Snowed-In/Amanda SearleWe’re huge fans of Stefan Golaszewski’s tender, funny yet always tinged with melancholy work such as Him & Her and Mum (which still makes us weep just to think of it). His latest show, Babies, sounds like no exception – with Paapa Essiedu and Siobhán Cullen starring as a couple who have to deal with the unparalleled grief of multiple pregnancy losses.BBCBeefThebest show of 2023is back with a new series. The last, in which Steven Yeun and Ali Wong fell into a rapidly escalating disagreement, was an absolute masterpiece. This time round there’s a whole new cast, including Oscar Isaac and Carey Mulligan, and a brand new disagreement. Can it be as good as the first? Can anything?NetflixBlue Planet IIIView image in fullscreenUtterly mind-boggling … a nurse shark glides through a shoal of sardines in Blue Planet III.Photograph: Anoushka Freedman/BBC StudiosDavid Attenborough celebrates his 100th birthday in May 2026 and he’ll be marking it with another landmark natural history epic. In a strong field, the first twoseasonsof Blue Planet are among his most memorable works: not only do the depths of the ocean offer utterly mind-boggling sights but it’s in the sea that humanity’s impact on nature can be most easily seen. Increasingly, Attenborough has refused to ignore environmental issues so this is likely to be a bracing watch as well as a beautiful one.BBC OneBuffy the Vampire Slayer: New SunnydaleBuffy the Vampire Slayer has had aJoss Whedon problemfor a while now. People still love it, but they have a hard time reconciling it with the actions that got its creator cancelled. The solution? New Sunnydale, a brand new Buffy set 25 years after the original. Sarah Michelle Gellar is back, heading up a new cast. Chloé Zhao (of Hamnet fame) has directed the pilot.Disney+California AvenueEver since 2011’s The Shadow Line, Hugo Blick has delighted in appearing every few years with a new, ambitious, boundary-testing standalone miniseries. California Avenue sounds like no exception. It’s about a woman on the run who takes refuge in a caravan park with her 11-year-old child. Erin Doherty, Bill Nighy, Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Burke star.BBCDear EnglandView image in fullscreenStirring stuff … Joseph Fiennes as Gareth Southgate in Dear England.Photograph: BBC/Left BankIt began as a letter, then became a play. Now Gareth Southgate’s 2021 state of the nation address has become a TV show. As with the stage version,Joseph Fienneswill play Southgate, leading a cast that includes Jodie Whittaker and Jason Watkins. If it’s faithful to the play – and it should be, since James Graham has written both versions – this will be stirring stuff indeed.BBCDTF St Louis“I would like you to go about your business and do tasks on your phone, while you sit on my face.” Landing with big NSFW energy – the acronym means “Down to Fuck” – on the new HBO Max channel (launching in the UK in March), it stars Jason Bateman, Linda Cardellini and David Harbour in a tale of bored suburbanites who end up on a hook-up app … until one of them winds up dead.HBO MaxFallingView image in fullscreenThere will be fireworks … Keeley Hawes as Anna and Paapa Essiedu as David in Falling.Photograph: Robert Viglasky/Channel 4Keeley Hawes and Paapa Essiedu play a nun and a Catholic priest who encounter all sorts of emotional turmoil when they fall in love. Written by man of the momentJack Thorne, this is, shockingly, the first love story he has ever penned. There will be fireworks.Channel 4First Day on EarthView image in fullscreenAstonishing … Michaela Coel in First Day on Earth.Photograph: BBCSix years after the astonishingI May Destroy Youpretty much invented a new TV language, Michaela Coel returns with another authored show. Coel is writer, star and executive producer of this drama about a blocked novelist, Henri, who is offered a job on a film in Ghana (the home of her estranged father) and can’t resist a roll of the dice. However, nothing about west Africa – or her father – is as she thought.BBC OneHalf ManView image in fullscreenGuaranteed to get a flood of public interest … Half Man.Photograph: Anne Binckebanck/BBC/Mam Tor ProductionsAs the follow-up toBaby Reindeer, Richard Gadd’s Half Man will surely be hit with a flood of public interest upon release. As yet, nobody knows what the show is – it’s described as being about brothers – but it will star Gadd alongside Jamie Bell, and hopefully won’t result in the inspiration for any of the characters appearing on Piers Morgan.BBC OneLast One Laughing UKAlthough the first season of Last One Laughing – a sort of condensed Big Brother about comedians trying to make other comedians laugh – came with no expectations, the second is already one of the most anticipated of the year. We are very hopeful about the lineup – which this time features everyone from Ultimate Traitor Alan Carr to Diane “Philomena Cunk” Morgan, Mel Giedroyc and David Mitchell. But the best news of all? Defending champion, the sublimeBob Mortimer, will be back too!Prime VideoLine of DutyView image in fullscreenNow we’re sucking diesel … Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar in Line of Duty.Photograph: BBC/World Productions/Steffan Hill/PANow we’re sucking diesel! After a year of rumours, the seventh season of this much-loved police procedural was confirmed in November. But AC-12 is dead, so long live the Inspectorate of Police Standards, which is the catchy moniker under which officers Hastings, Fleming and Arnott will now be working. In a plotline that looks unlikely to stretch plausibility to breaking point, the team will be investigating a detective inspector accused of being a sexual predator.BBC OneMaudHer last show All’s Fair may have brought about a flurry ofzero-star reviews, butGlenn Close’s Maud sounds much better. Close plays “an old killer with a tortured past” who becomes tired of looking after everyone and sets out to begin a second act. Close is never better than when she has a role she can fully sink her teeth into. This sounds like exactly that.Channel 4MayaView image in fullscreenOn the run … Daisy Haggard in Maya.Photograph: Channel 4Her seriesBack to Lifewas often just as sad as it was funny, so it’s no surprise that Daisy Haggard’s next show is a full-blown thriller. Maya is about a woman (Haggard) and her daughter (Bella Ramsey) who flee their lives and begin again in a witness protection programme in rural Scotland, while a pair of hitmen search for them. Everything about this one looks wonderful.Channel 4MintWithin minutes of this drama opening, Shannon (played by Emma Laird) talks about her longing for romance and wanting her life to be magic … before literally soaring off the ground. With its magical realism and the use of camcorder footage, we can certainly expect surreal, experimental things from the first show by Charlotte Regan (who directed the movie Scrapper.) Soon enough, a love interest comes along in the form of Arran – played by Ben Coyle-Larner (AKA musician Loyle Carner.)BBCNumber 10Steven Moffat had us at “Press Gang in Downing Street”, but really Number 10 sounds more like a British West Wing than anything else. Moffat’s series about the inner workings of 10 Downing Street, concerning the individuals who keep such a bizarre residence going, has all the markings of a blockbuster.Channel 4Pride and PrejudiceView image in fullscreenUniversal truth … Pride and Prejudice.Photograph: Ludovic Robert/NetflixAs if the return of Netflix mainstay Bridgerton and the BBC’sThe Other Bennet Sisterweren’t enough to make period drama fans swoon into their smelling salts, here comes Dolly Alderton’s Pride and Prejudice. Will it become as beloved as the Colin Firth version? Let’s wait till Jack Lowden emerges from that lake, shirt sodden and billowing, to find out.NetflixRivalsView image in fullscreenRomp alert … Nafessa Williams in Rivals.Photograph: Ana Blumenkron/Disney+Finally, after far too long, the second series of Disney’s febrile Jilly Cooperadaptation– almost certainly the horniest show ever to revolve round regional TV franchises – will arrive in 2026. Expect bums, boobs, romps, backstabbers, cads, bounders, revenge, perms, poshness, bravado, bitchiness, ego, excess and deception. And bums.Disney+Small ProphetsThis comedy was written by Mackenzie Crook and, like his previous creation, the utterly sublime Detectorists, it looks for magic in the mundane. The series centres on Pearce Quigley’s gently eccentric Michael Sleep – a man who works in a DIY store, hangs out with his dad Brian (Michael Palin) and pines after his beloved partner Clea who disappeared seven years earlier. Then Michael tries to create a homunculus and things start to get weird. Sophie Willan, Jon Pointing and Lauren Patel also star.BBCSpider-NoirNicolas Cage all but stole 2018’s Into the Spider-Verse as Spider-Man Noir, a monochrome 1930s private investigator who also has the powers of Spider-Man. Amazingly, that character is about to get its own series. Even more amazingly, Cage is reprising his role. Even more amazingly, it’s going to be live action. This could be, well, amazing.Disney+The AltruistsIn the mould of The Dropout or Dopesick, The Altruists is a ripped-from-the-headlines drama about Sam Bankman-Fried, the real-life disgraced founder of a collapsed crypto exchange. Bankman-Fried’s fall from grace was certainly spectacular enough to warrant the treatment, so here’s hoping showrunner Graham Moore does it justice. Julia Garner and Anthony Boyle star.NetflixThe BoroughsAfter ending the year with the biggest bang imaginable in the Stranger Things finale, the Duffer Brothers already have their next project in the bag. The Boroughs stars Geena Davis andAlfred Molinaand is described as a sci-fi set in a retirement village, where “a group of unlikely heroes must band together to stop an otherworldly threat from stealing the one thing they don’t have … time”.NetflixThe Boys from BrazilAfter spending the last decade on The Crown, Peter Morgan dives into a story of Nazi hunters in an epic miniseries adapted from Ira Levin’s 70s novel. The ever-intense Jeremy Strong stars as Yakov Liebermann (played by Laurence Olivier in the 1978 film), a Holocaust survivor who has devoted his life to tracking down Nazis on the run – then gets a phone call from Brazil with intel on a fugitive German eugenicist.NetflixThe CageWhen The Responder – starring Martin Freeman as a scouse night cop on the brink of a breakdown – first appeared, it came out of the gates so fully formed and so spectacular that it was inconceivable that this was Tony Schumacher’s first show. And yet it was true. Now comes his second, The Cage, starring the brilliant Sheridan Smith and Michael Socha – about two Liverpool casino workers who discover they’re both robbing from the same safe …. and the same gangster. You wouldn’t want to bet against this one.BBCThe Devil in the White CityThis Martin Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio collaboration – about the serial killer who offed people in his Murder Castle in Chicago in the run-up to the 1893 World’s Fair – has been mooted for way over a decade, starting life as a movie. Will this be the year we finally see it … and as a full series no less?TBAThe Miniature WifeLike Succession meets, er, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, The Miniature Wife sounds like an incredibly timely satire, tackling both romantic power plays and our extreme technological angst. Matthew Macfadyen’s Les has to deal with the fallout after he shrinks his wife Lindy (Elizabeth Banks) to six inches high. Move over, Rick Moranis!Sky/NowThe PittView image in fullscreenLet us watch it – and stat! … Noah Wyle in The Pitt.Photograph: AlamyHow frustrating to see therest of the world fall in lovewith The Pitt – a real-time medical drama starring Noah Wyle of ER fame that swept the awards, reinvigorated network television and has set a template for the future of the medium – when it wasn’t available to watch here. Fortunately that will change soon, just in time for its second season.HBO MaxThe Reluctant VampireRob and Neil Gibbons of Alan Partridge fame have written a sitcom about what Lenny Rush would be like if he had to pretend to be a vampire all the time. The result is billed as “a heartwarming show about finding your own identity while longing to fit in”. Pencil this one in as the next Ghosts.BBCThe TestamentsView image in fullscreenUps the dystopian stakes … Chase Infiniti in The Testaments.Photograph: DisneyThe year after The Handmaid’s Tale ended, in steps Margaret Atwood’ssequel The Testamentsto up the dystopian stakes on our screens. Brace yourself for scandalous kidnappings, teen rebels – and a very fed up Aunt Lydia (still played by the glorious Ann Dowd) trying to take Gilead down from within.Disney+Tip ToeView image in fullscreen‘The fight is on’ … Alan Cumming in Tip Toe.Photograph: Channel 4/Ben BlackallA new Russell T Davies drama is always a treat – and this one comes in the vein of his classics like It’s A Sin and stars David Morrissey and Alan Cumming, no less. Twenty-five years on from Queer As Folk, Davies and his team are going back to Manchester’s Canal Street to shed light on the LGBTQ+ community today amid rising danger and fear. As he has said: “This is a show I had to write because the world is getting stranger, tougher and darker, and frankly, the fight is on.” Bring it.Channel 4TimeFirstit wasStephen Graham with Sean Bean. Thenit wasBella Ramsey, Tamara Lawrance and Jodie Whittaker. Now for the third instalment of Jimmy McGovern’s harrowing but gripping prison drama, David Tennant will be going head to head with Siobhan Finneran, who returns as the prison pastor (only now she’s lost her faith). It’s set in a young offenders institution when chaos hits, so it’s sure to be a riot of violence and raging hormones.BBC OneTomb RaiderFor an absurdly long time, it looked like the only thing to emerge from Amazon’s $100m deal with Phoebe Waller-Bridge was a little-watched documentary about octopuses. But that changes in 2026, because her big new Tomb Raider adaptation will finally arrive, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Let’s hope it was worth the investment.Prime VideoTrinityJed Mercurio has a busy year ahead. As well as the return of Line of Duty, there is also Netflix’s Trinity – a high-stakes drama about a naval officer who becomes entwined with the secretary of defence. Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the officer, Richard Madden is the secretary, and if it’s anything like Bodyguard, this will be all we’ll talk about for weeks.NetflixTwenty Twenty SixView image in fullscreenScathing satire … Hugh Bonneville as Ian Fletcher and Chelsey Crisp as Sarah Campbell in Twenty Twenty Six.Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC/Expectation EntertainmentIt may have its detractors, but John Morton’s Twenty Twelve and W1A were living proof that the BBC is its own biggest critic. Luckily, 2026 will see an update, set round the World Cup. Hughs Bonneville and Skinner return for more scathing satire about what it’s like to be trapped in the bureaucratic nightmare of an organisation unable to work out its own identity.BBC TwoVisionQuestAfter a string of skippable duds, the MCU’s television adventures continue with VisionQuest. Happily, there’s lots to be excited about here. Billed as the final part of a trilogy that began with WandaVision and Agatha All Along, it sounds like it will be an exploration of Marvel’s AI characters, from Vision to Ultron.Disney+WarGeorge Kay is a writer with tremendous pedigree, so his new show War should be highly anticipated purely because of that. However, it also stars Dominic West andSienna Milleras a divorcing high-powered couple (he a tech titan, she a movie star) who resort to underhand methods to get what they deserve. Sure to be shockingly entertaining.Sky Atlantic/NowExplore more on these topicsTelevision2026 culture previewDramaTV comedyDawn FrenchGbemisola IkumelofeaturesShareReuse this content"

Smith’s lawyer has called the allegations ‘false, baseless and reckless’Laura SnapesFri 2 Jan 2026 06.03 ESTLast modified on Fri 2 Jan 2026 12.18 ESTShareWill Smith is being sued by a violinist from his 2025 tour, who claims the rapper and actor exhibited “predatory behaviour” and was “deliberately grooming and priming” him for “further sexual exploitation”. Brian King Joseph is also pursuing the performer and his company Treyball Studios Management for wrongful termination and retaliation in a suit filed in the superior court of California.Joseph alleges that he was hired for the tour in support of Smith’s new album, Based on a True Story, after first appearing on stage with Smith in December 2024. The suit claims that Smith once told Joseph, “You and I have such a special connection that I don’t have with anyone else.”In March 2025, Joseph alleges that his bag and hotel room key went missing at a Las Vegas tour date, and was returned several hours later. That night, Joseph claims he went to his hotel room to find it had been “unlawfully” accessed, with wipes and HIV medication bearing another person’s name left behind, in addition to a note that read: “Brian, I’ll be back no later 5.30, just us <3, Stone F.” Joseph said he concluded that “an unknown individual would soon return to his room to engage in sexual acts” with him.The suit states that members of the tour’s management were “the only individuals with access” to his room. Joseph says that he notified hotel security and representatives for Smith and reported the incident to a non-emergency police line. Joseph claims that he was later “shamed” by a member of Smith’s management team over the incident, and had his contract terminated, with the implication that he had fabricated the event.Joseph’s suit claims that the termination led to him suffering from PTSD and economic loss.Smith’s attorney Allen B Grodsky denied these allegations in a statement to the Daily Mail which read: “Mr Joseph’s allegations concerning my client are false, baseless and reckless.“They are categorically denied, and we will use all legal means available to address these claims and to ensure that the truth is brought to light.” The Guardian has contacted Smith’s representatives.Based on a True Story wasSmith’s first album in 20 years. It touched in part on his assault on Chris Rock at the 2022 Academy Awards. The album was a flop, failing to chart in any major territory and spending one week at No 79 on the UK album downloads chart (not the main album chart).Ina review of the album for Pitchforkrated 2.4/10, critic Stephen Kearse wrote: “Based on a True Story lacks the easy repose of an artist in their comfort zone, or the playfulness of one cutting loose in their sanctum. It is a campaign platform, devoid of perspective or style, uninterested in narrative or even spin, but always on message:Please take me back.”Explore more on these topicsWill SmithnewsShareReuse this content"

Her brother, Austin, is 43.As a child, Jones acted alongside her father in films such as Men in Black II and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and she also appeared in the TV series One Tree Hill.When promoting The Three Burials, Tommy Lee Jones said of his daughter: “She’s a good actress, has her SAG [Screen Actors Guild] card, speaks impeccable Spanish. When she was a baby, I told Leticia, her nurse, to speak to her in Spanish.”He also said that as a teenager, she had balked at the early starts required on film sets. “She had to get up at 5am for her part,” he told theNew Yorker. “One morning, she wouldn’t get out of bed. I said: ‘Honey, this is work.’ But she wouldn’t budge.“So I fired her. Then, without telling me, the production staff went over and woke her and rushed her out to the set just in time.”The pair appeared together frequently on the red carpet, including in October 2018, when he was on the jury of the Tokyo film festival.Tommy Lee Jones, 79, won an Oscar and Golden Globe for his role in The Fugitive and has also acted in films such as JFK, Lincoln, In the Valley of Elah and No Country for Old Men.Explore more on these topicsTommy Lee JonesSan FranciscoCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2013, Duthuit gave the Pompidou Centre Marguerite with a Black Cat, one of Matisse’s best known portraits of his daughter.View image in fullscreenMarguerite, 1901 ou 1906.Photograph: Musée d’Art Moderne de ParisMarguerite, who was Matisse’s favourite subject, was born during his relationship with one of his models, Caroline Joblau, when he was studying art inParis. The artist recognised the child and brought Marguerite to live with his new family, including her half-brothers Jean and Pierre, when he married four years later.Aged six, Marguerite contracted diphtheria and had an emergency tracheotomy. For many years she would disguise the scar with high-necked blouses or ribbons, as the portraits show, until she underwent an operation to repair it when she was 26.Although her health remained fragile, Marguerite joined the French resistance during the second world war, was tortured by the Gestapo, and was threatened with deportation to a Nazi concentration camp.She had taken up painting and was included in group exhibitions during the war, but gave it up to devote herself to being her father’s assistant and agent until his death at 84, in November 1954. She was still cataloguing her father’s work when she died in Paris in 1982, aged 87.Matisse preferred to keep his art in the family rather than sell it, making the donation particularly significant. The 61 pieces will join the 20 Matisse artworks already held by the museum.View image in fullscreenÉtudes pour Marguerite lisant, 1906.Photograph: Jean-Louis Losi/Musée d’Art Moderne de ParisFabrice Hergott, MAM’s director, described the portraits of Marguerite as “extremely beautiful and moving”.“This extraordinarily generous gesture testifies to Madame Duthuit’s deep commitment to and confidence in the museum, which effectively becomes Marguerite’s new home for the decades and centuries to come,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHenri MatisseParisFranceMuseumsEuropePaintingDrawingnewsShareReuse this content"

George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration,” Trump wrote.“Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,” the president added. “He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics.”Referring to the US midterm elections on 3 November,Clooney told the Hollywood Reporterin response: “I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again. We’ll start in November.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Clooney and Amal Clooney pose for a photo before a screening of the film, The Boys in the Boat, in London in 2023.Photograph: Alberto Pezzali/Invision/APThe news that Clooney and his family are becoming French comes before language requirements for citizenship being toughened for everyone else under new immigration rules from 1 January.A junior member of French president Emmanuel Macron’s government had also criticised the decision to award passports despite Clooney speaking poor French.George Clooney says his children have a ‘much better life’ being raised in France than LARead more“Personally, I understand the feeling of some French people of a double standard,” Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior interior minister, told the France Info radio station. “We need to be careful about the message we’re sending.”Her boss, interior minister Laurent Nunez, and the foreign ministry defended the decision.The civil code states that “French nationality may be conferred by naturalisation, upon the proposal of the minister of foreign affairs, to any French-speaking foreigner who applies for it and who contributes through their distinguished service to France’s influence and the prosperity of its international economic relations.”Under the new immigration rules, applicants will need a certificate showing they have a level of French that could get them into a French university. They will also have to pass a civic knowledge test.But Clooney has conceded that his French remains poor. “I love the French culture, your language, even if I’m still bad at it after 400 days of courses,” the actor told RTL radio – in English – in December.His wife, an international human rights lawyer and dual UK-Lebanese national, speaks fluent French.Clooney bought the Domaine du Canadel, a former wine estate, near the Provence town of Brignoles, in 2021. He said it is where his family is “happiest”.Nunez, the interior minister, said he was “very happy” with the actor and his family becoming French, saying the country was lucky to have them.The French foreign ministry said the passport allocation for the Clooneys “meets the conditions set by law” for naturalisation, having “followed a rigorous procedure including security investigations, regulatory naturalisation interviews at the prefecture, and the payment of tax stamps.”George Clooney says replacing Joe Biden with Kamala Harris ‘was a mistake’Read moreThe Clooneys “contribute through their distinguished service to France’s international influence and cultural prestige” through the actor’s role in the film industry, the ministry added, which would “only contribute to maintaining and promoting France’s position in this essential economic sector”.Amal Clooney is “a renowned lawyer” who “regularly collaborates with academic institutions and international organisations based in France,” the ministry added.Approximately 48,800 people acquired French nationality by decree in 2024, according to interior ministry figures.Clooney is not alone in wanting a French passport: Hollywood director Jim Jarmusch announced on Friday that he was also applying, telling French radio that he wanted “a place to where I can escape the United States”.Agence-France Press contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGeorge ClooneyFranceEuropeDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

A central sequence entitled Impasse is inspired by Georges Simenon’s Maigret novels. These poems plunge us into the landscape of the detective hero’s world, a process O’Brien describes as “analogous to dream-life, where certain motifs (cities, railway stations, libraries in my case) recur without ever abolishing the mystery that animates them”. The penultimate poem of the final sequence ushers in an elegiac, pensive tone as the speaker reminds us not to forget “birdsong / the descant of the rising lark / that never ends, composed of silence”. The book reinforces O’Brien’s authority as a chronicler of our times, “love and death consorting as they must”.View image in fullscreenPlasticby Matthew Rice (Fitzcarraldo, £12.99)This book-length poem explores the experiences of a night worker turned poet. Structured as a continuous narrative, it illustrates the frustrations, inequities and relentless cycle of 21st-century manual labour: “The night is proletarian, a morgue of ghosts / given the present is a borderline”. Rice documents the tragic incidents and surreal imaginings that occur within the nightmarish confines of a plastic moulding factory. “Once, in this building, a kid clocked off night shift / for good at the end of a rope / another’s heart gave out at 3am / performing a task as menial as mine.” This sardonic, bleakly moving book interrogates ideas of working-class masculinity and intergenerational trauma, with “hell as an idea of what work could be”; there are glimpses of hope in poetry itself, “the treasure buried in my father’s field”.Retablofor a Door by Michelle Penn(Shearsman, £12.95)Penn’s latest collection draws on the concept of a retablo – a votive created in thanks for protection or a miracle – to explore challenging aspects of female experience. In doing so, she conveys multiple images of womanhood as “a gallery of retablos, every edge, every overcoming”. Divided into seven sections, these vivid and formally innovative poems engage with ideas of performance and becoming, depicting vulnerable moments of self-effacement and discomfort in the search for identity. The exploration of intense emotions culminates in the final poem’s searing assertion of defiance as it champions “the humiliated girls, the taunted girls, the bullied girls and the rejected girls”. Penn envisages their uprising and rebellion as they “nap on the sand’s neck, soak in the ocean / defy the world where women trail girls / behind them like flames”.View image in fullscreenJonah and Meby John F Deane (Carcanet, £12.99)Deane’s poetry shimmers with the luminosity of his Christian faith, explored through various voices. He exhorts us to live a life filled with reverence for “Yeshua – you, water-walker”, to whom the poet comes to “offer poems, petitionary, like prayers”. These lucid, musical poems are attuned to the beauty of nature, “waves of grass under the breeze / and gracious meadows wild with buttercups”. Deane acknowledges the fragmented times we live in – “we know that barbarism / divides us, soul from soul” and “the world faces its nightmares / of wars and violence”. This is an expansive, sonically rich collection, filled with captivating images and resonant phrases that leave us with a sense of wonder. The final poem gestures towards a spiritual departure from life as the speaker envisions slipping “through the red gate”, finding “the longed-for strength”, “towards a long-anticipated rest”.Intimate Architectureby Tess Jolly (Blue Diode, £10)The titular poem of Jolly’s second collection evokes the image of a doll’s house where the walls are “as tender as our honeycomb of chambers / protected by paper-thin membranes”. Many of the poems explore the need for “delicate” boundaries in a relationship between the self and the other. Recalling fairytale, myth and childhood memory, these well-crafted works reveal inner anxieties as they collide with external realities, “the structures we built from our fear of the world”. Jolly skilfully depicts the tensions within human relationships as well as the desire for intimacy, where “those who love her / learn to hold their tongues / as she holds them / at arm’s length – longing / to let herself be held”. Her use of imagery is arresting: “the stars like tiny bulbs so bright / they could, at any moment, shatter”; a forest which “imagines a different story”; the fragility of an anorexic female body, “your flamingo legs … the trick of your stick-insect arms”.Explore more on these topicsPoetryPoetry roundupreviewsShareReuse this content"

The cross-generational lineup and captivating ideas of Riversphere, his first solo release in years, testify to exactly why he has stayed there for 40 years.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Riversphere Vol 1In their 20s, Ballamy and pianist/composer Django Bates frequently joined forces as two mavericks, skilfully respectful of the classic jazz tradition while adventurously and often mischievously transforming it. They were key figures in a gifted UK generation that created some of the sparkiest European jazz of the 1980s and 90s, most influentially in the revolutionary orchestra Loose Tubes, which brought together genres from old-school swing to vaudeville, improv and avant-rock, and on occasion really did get people dancing in the streets.Riversphere likens the interweaving of rivers to the flows of music-making between genres, individuals and across the blurred lines of composition and improv. Ballamy’s beautifully paced and tonally evocative sax sound fronts an A-list quartet with the atmospherically Bill Frisell-ian guitarist Rob Luft, bassist Conor Chaplin and drummer Corrie Dick, while the ever-empathic Laura Jurd and Ballamy’s very promising son Charlie share trumpet roles on three tracks – notably the set’s exquisitely harmonised finale, As Time Passes.The horns and guitar shift from folksy songlike lines to raw note-bending on the opening Harmonique, while wistful guitar and sax long tones delicately drift through softly shifting drum patterns on Unresolved. Frisell’s dreamy Strange Meeting sets slow tenor exhalations floating amid treble-guitar peals, and two yearning Chico Buarque/Jobim songs warmly reflect both Ballamy’s affection for Latin jazz and north-Euro ambient music, and Luft’s versatility as a tone-poet and a nimble postbopper. Volume 2 is already in the pipeline – an intriguing prospect for later this year.Also out this monthKeyboardist Craig Taborn, legendary reeds player Henry Threadgill and trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire are among many jazz stars duetting with double bassistThomas Morganon the latter’s Around You Is a Forest (Loveland) – but Morgan mainly plays the Woods here, his own virtual invention mimicking the sounds of lutes, harps, zithers and more. The machine creates a fascinating soundscape, even if, compared to Morgan’s bass imagination, it sometimes seems to hamper the two-way flexibility of these conversations.Tom Ollendorff’s Where in the World (Fresh Sound New Talent) creatively augments this fine young UK guitarist’s closely attuned regular trio with Blue Note’s US piano star Aaron Parks, on fast, hard-boppish groovers, elegant melodies (all Ollendorff’s) and inventive improv. And the late great UK pianistJohn Taylor’s Tramonto (ECM) is the welcome unveiling of a live recording by the superb 2002 trio (with Americans Marc Johnson on bass and Joey Baron on drums) who made Taylor’s iconic ECM studio set Rosslyn in the same year.Explore more on these topicsMusicJazz album of the monthJazzreviewsShareReuse this content"

The British four-piece are keen to take us back to their early 00s heyday, a time of Met bar table service, where the ladies have “a little prosecco” and the guys have a “nice cold beer”. Musically, it’s a clunkier approximation of their (comparatively) harder-edged hybrid of pop, hip-hop and R&B; think 2002 “low ride” anthem Fly By II but on a Megabus budget.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for ReflectionsIt makes sense that they would want to tap into modern pop’s deep well of nostalgia, but rather than recalling what made Blue originally stand out, Reflections often feels like a tribute to other evergreen boybands. For most of the album’s 13 tracks, the tempo is mid, with the dreary, Westlife-on-a-bad-day Candlelight Fades a particular nadir. The windsweptOne Last Timeand The Day the Earth Stood Still are attacked with gusto, but both feel like Patience-era Take That, while the pleasingly epic opener The Vow is hindered by very un-Barlow lyrics: “You’re a sweet child of mine / You’re like a grape to my vine.”With multiple references to the band’s history, acoustic closer Find That Feeling pleads for a chance to return to the start, “to be young and to be foolish”. Reflections makes you wish they’d focused on more of the latter.Explore more on these topicsBluePop and rockalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

A 0% gin brings some botanical notes to proceedings, but the syrup also works wonderfully just topped with soda water. You’ll need to start the syrup a day ahead.Beetroot and sumac shrubServes1For the beetroot and sumac syrup100mlfresh beetroot juice100gcaster sugar30g sumac100mlfresh lemonFor the shrub50ml beetroot and sumac syrup(see above and method)25ml 0% gin– we useGordon’s Dry 00Soda water, to taste1 rosemary sprig, to garnishPut all the ingredients for the syrup in a saucepan, bring to a gentle simmer and leave to cook for five minutes, stirring so the sugar dissolves. Decant into a clean jar, seal and put in the fridge overnight. The next day, fine strain the syrup, ideally through a piece of muslin, into a second clean jar (or airtight container) and seal. It will keep for a week in the fridge, or a month in the freezer.To build the drink, measure the syrup and 0% gin into a shaker filled with ice, then shake until the shaker is cold to the touch. Strain into a tumbler filled with fresh ice, top with soda water and serve garnished with the rosemary.Connor Wilson, head chef,The Kirkstyle Inn, Slaggyford, NorthumberlandExplore more on these topicsCocktailsThe good mixerFoodVegetablesSoft drinksSpiritsHerbs and spicesrecipesShareReuse this content"

In a month that’s typically grey, dreary and ridiculously long, it’s the little things that spark joy. Granted, I’m not necessarily reaching for anything too rich or heavy, but when I’m craving a bit of sweetness, the likes of this yoghurt panna cotta really hit the spot. If you squint, it could easily be mistaken for a fun breakfast pot.Yoghurt panna cotta with banana and tahini crumbleThe crumble will make more than you need for this, so save the leftovers in an airtight container for a handy crunchy snack.Prep5 minChill2 hr+Cook50 minMakes4For the panna cotta2gelatine sheets300gwhipping cream60ghoney1 tspvanilla bean pastePinch of salt300g Greek yoghurtFor the tahini crumble80g jumbo oats50g plain flour40g light brown sugar2 tbsp sesame seedsPinch flaky sea salt¼ tsp ground cinnamon50g unsalted butter,melted30g tahini2½ tbsp honey2 small bananas,slicedPut the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water, leave to soak for five minutes, until softened, then drain, squeeze out any excess water and set aside.Put the cream, honey, vanilla and salt in a small pan and heat gently until hot, but not boiling. Off the heat, stir in the squeezed gelatine until completely dissolved. Whisk in the yoghurt, then pour the mixture into four small glasses or ramekins, and chill in the fridge for a couple of hours, until set.Meanwhile, make the crumble. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 and line a small baking tray with greaseproof paper. Put the oats, flour, sugar, sesame seeds, salt and cinnamon in a bowl and mix to combine. Stir in the melted butter and tahini, then mix well to coat. Pour on to the lined tray, then bake for 18-22 minutes, until well browned. Remove, leave to cool completely, then break up the crumble into rough pieces.Put the honey and two tablespoons of water in a small pan and heat gently. Add the sliced bananas, cook until they soften a little and the liquid turns syrupy, then take off the heat and leave to cool a little.Spoon the warm bananas on top of the panna cottas, top with some of the tahini crumble and serve.Explore more on these topicsDessertThe sweet spotFoodBakingFruitBreakfastCereals and grainsrecipesShareReuse this content"
