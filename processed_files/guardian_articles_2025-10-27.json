Now Peter Doig is celebrating his love of music with an exhibition at the Serpentine in London that pairs recent paintings with his favourite records played through an extraordinary sound system. So we asked other contemporary artists what music means to them.View image in fullscreenAn extraordinary sound system … Peter Doig’s exhibition House of Music at Serpentine Gallery, London.Photograph: Guy Bell/Shutterstock‘I never tire of Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life’Harold OffehThere was a lot of music in my house growing up. It’s only recently I’ve come to appreciate the richness of it. My family is from Ghana so there was a lot of highlife, afrobeat, African gospel – now I think it’s amazing, but back then it was just my parents’ music. One of my uncles lived with us for a little while. He used to play a lot of Grace Jones, and I grew up with the Island Lifealbum, which was the starting point for my Coversseries. I decided to restage images of performers from the 70s and 80s. All roads lead to Grace Jones.Favourite music:I never get tired of Songs in the Key of Life by Stevie Wonder. It’s a double album and the scope is extraordinary. I loveAs – the soulfulness of it. It’s a ride.Peter Doig: House of Music review – intoxicating paintings with a banging soundtrackRead more‘My life is pretty drenched in music’Ragnar KjartanssonI remember walking to school in Iceland in winter as a teenager listening to the Cure on my Walkman. Plainsong, the first song off their album Disintegration, goes: “It’s so cold, it’s like the cold if you were dead.” That was always fun when it was freezing and I was trying to dress swanky for school, listening to the Cure pumping gorgeous melancholia into me.My studio by the harbour in Reykjavik is kind of a hangout for musicians. Sometimes I’m painting and my friends are playing Bach on the piano. My life is pretty drenched in music. I listen to it as I work, as I do the dishes. I love listening to it with my teenage daughter, it’s an awesome thing to do driving around in the car. You can imagine how happy a moment it was for us whenOlivia Rodrigo collaborated with Robert Smithfrom the Cure.Favouritemusic:At the moment it’s Sabrina Carpenter’s Manchild, but the piece that profoundly affected my approach to art is Dichterliebe by Robert Schumann, deconstructing romanticism at the height of romanticism.View image in fullscreenChris Ofili: ‘Sonic arrangements can be colourful.’Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian‘I mourn the decline of radio’Chris OfiliWhen I worked in my studio in King’s Cross in the late 90s, playing music would help to drown out the urban soundscape. Now, in my hillside studio in Trinidad, insect wings, raindrops and birdlife are my background music, so I have to choose what I play very carefully. Vocals and sonic arrangements stimulate thoughts and emotions and can be colourful too – all considerations when making paintings.I’m still mourning the decline of radio across the airwaves, when music permeated for free through tiny speakers, from passing vehicles, shops and cafes, and big soundsystems. Radio DJs introduced me to so much great music. But just as a reproduction of a Giotto fresco doesn’t compare to seeing it in the Arena Chapel in Padua, some recorded music fails to capture the complexity of hearing it performed live. In Trinidad, hearing steel pan music performed outdoors by an orchestra is hair-raising.Favourite music:These days, I’m listening toSaultin my studio. Interweaving the Black experience, faith, love, spirituality and mystery, their experimental albums ring true for me.‘Fireboy DML revived me when I was making nudes’Joy LabinjoI often listen to the same song over and over again, and I can always recall what I was listening to when I was making a certain body of work. I was obsessed with Peru by Fireboy DML, which came out in 2021, when I was making my nudes for Lagos. It was the height of the pandemic and I had Covid. That song was really helpful. It would bring me alive again after lunch when I was crashing.When I’m painting, what I’m looking for is a trance-like state in which I’m not thinking about the music too much. So familiar songs are most helpful. I’ll listen to new songs in the car, and then once I’ve got a level of familiarity, I can bring them into the studio where it feels more intimate. My Spotify-liked songs are what get me going.Favourite music:Right now it’s Sade’s Babyfather, just for the beat and how it makes me feel relaxed. It’s old, but new to me.‘I listen to people talking about how awful the world is’Jeremy DellerI think an artist’s relationship to music is no different from anyone else’s. However much we think we love music, we’ll never love it as much as theChappell Roanfans I saw on telly at Reading festival this year. Maybe we as adults want to get back to that state of ecstasy. I’ve worked with musicians loads, but I barely have music on when I work at home because it’s too distracting. I tend to listen to people talking about how awful the world is.Favourite music:John Cage’s 4’33”. It helps me think.View image in fullscreenLindsey Mendick: ‘My best friend is a pop star.’Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian‘Self Esteem’s anthems push me to be braver’Lindsey MendickBefore I was thinking of being an artist, I wanted to be a singer. I was a massive Spice Girls fan. When I first started listening to them aged seven, I didn’t realise the world wasn’t tipped in women’s favour. I just saw women taking over the world and being really powerful. My first installation would probably be the shrine to them I created in my childhood bedroom.My best friend is a pop star. She’s calledSelf Esteem. We met about 10 years ago in Sheffield; people said we wouldn’t like each other because we’re both strong female characters. Her songs are anthems for women who don’t fit in the box of what you’re meant to be. They push me to be braver. I use music to pick me up – often sad girl bangers. Sometimes in my studio I sing really forcefully, and my assistants are like, “It’s one ofthesedays …”Favourite music:Beyoncé’s Lemonade. In that album she seemed so empowered, honest and raw.‘I used to listen to opera full blast’Tom HammickI was artist in residence at the ENO and Glyndebourne, so I’ve had to listen to a lot of opera. There’s a connection between the framing of opera – at night, with a spotlight – and the way that, as a romantic painter, I’m picking up on drama. I’m an expressionistic painter, and you can pick colour out of the darkness in the same way that happens in opera.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now I’m in London and I can’t do that so much. But I do play music all the time.Favourite music:Harvest Moon by Neil Young. That’s the most romantic song you’ve ever heard, isn’t it?View image in fullscreen‘I was fascinated by the sound of electricity’ … Haroon Mirza behind the decks.Photograph: Dave Benett/Getty Images for Frieze‘A mixtape became embedded in my psyche’Haroon MirzaListening to electronic music as a teenager was a massive shift. I remember being at a house party; a few of us were tripping. As the night progressed, this 90-minute mixtape was playing on a loop, and it just became embedded in my psyche. It wasn’t until later that I realised it was the sound of electricity I was becoming fascinated by.I used to call myself a composer because my installation and sculptural work is sound-based and unfolds both visually and acoustically through time and space. Then I was asked to propose a commission for the Royal College of Music, and they grilled me. I thought: “There are people who go to music school and train, who can read and write music, who reallyarecomposers.” So I realised it wasn’t going to cut it.Favourite music:My own track: Ceasefire Algorithm. Also, the Korgis’ Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime.‘I photographed the Clash for their first hit’Caroline CoonI’ve always lived on streets annually freed for Notting Hill carnival, where British pop music has been redefined. Early on, the spirit-raising rhythms were steel band calypso and soca. By the 1970s, huge soundsystems blasted out reggae. Naturally, carnival floats and DJ soundsystems appear in my urban landscape paintings.In 1976, like the Clash’s Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon, I was at the carnival when Black youths rioted. This anti-racist protest inspired the Clash’s song White Riot, which became their first hit single with one of my early punk photos of the band on the cover. For me, music and art are inseparable – I like to feel music rhythms in my painting compositions. Choosing what music to play is part of my daily ritual.Favourite music:This summer, A Mass of Life by Frederick Delius has been my favourite, played continuously – fabulous sequences of massed choir colour.View image in fullscreenLaure Provost: ‘The guts of my videos is sound – the image is the facade.’Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian‘I love recording dripping and scratching’Laure ProuvostMine wasn’t a household full of music, but there was a lot of nature – the sound of the wind and birds. Where does music start? Is it birdsong in the garden? The sound of a kettle getting madder and madder with boiling water? Music is everywhere, though of course there are moments when it’s intensified and you’re more conscious of it.I’m from the film and video world, so sound is a material that I work with. I remember Peter Cusack, one of my teachers years ago at Saint Martins, saying, “You have to make your own sound.” I also work with musicians. I’ve worked with people to make a catchy song that takes you galloping through the fields, and to create the sound of a wave splashing in your face. I also love recording things like dripping or scratching on my iPhone. The guts of my videos is sound; the image is the facade.Favourite music:I Put a Spell on You by Screamin’ Jay Hawkins. It’s a classic.Jean-Paul Goude’s best photograph: an androgynous Grace JonesRead more‘I found my way back to art through music’Mark LeckeyWhen I went to art school, learning about theory was an obstacle to creativity. The way I found my way back to making art was through music. If I wanted to make a new work, or I was thinking through ideas, I’d start listening to specific songs that I would use as a blueprint. I’d think: “I want to evoke the same things this song is inducing in me.”What I love about music is that it’s democratic, but it also allows you to access something beyond your own experience. It can be both local and avant garde. Why does art struggle with that?Favourite music:I used to listen toTrip II the Moon (Part 2) by Acenbefore I made anything. It’s the most ecstatic record I know, but undergirding it is a kind of melancholy.Peter Doig: House of Music is atSerpentine South Gallery, London, until 8 FebruaryHarold Offeh: Mmm Gotta Try a Little Harder, It Could Be Sweet is atKettle’s Yard, Cambridge, 15 November to 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingPop and rockOperaClassical musicDance musicRagnar KjartanssonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But he agrees with themJohn CraceReform is no place for racists, and every party has its bad apples. But the benchmark seems to be higher at Farage’s partyMon 27 Oct 2025 14.42 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 17.10 EDTShareIt’s the hottest new competition in Westminster. The accolade some MPs will do anything to win. It’s Racist of the Week. To Robert Jenrick’s intense annoyance, the Tory whip Katie Lamwon it at a canter last week. Chin up, Honest Bob. Your time will come again. Though probably not this week. It may only be Monday but the Reform MP Sarah Pochin has already stretched out a commanding lead. It will take an immense effort from someone to knock Nurse Ratched back into second place.Weirdly, it always seems that those people who complain the loudest about political correctness gone mad and how you can’t say anything these days are the ones who seem to find a way to let everyone know how they feel. It’s almost as though they do protest too much. Poor Sarah. Think how she suffers. Imagine the things she might come up with if only she didn’t have to hold herself back. She is just too good for such a cruel world.Ben Jennings on the Reform row over TV adverts – cartoonRead moreTo recap, Nurse Ratched was appearing on TalkTV when a viewer phoned in to complain about the demographics in adverts. This turned out to be a tipping point for Sarah and there was no stopping her. Her whole life had been blighted by having to see so many brown and black faces on TV. It was like a form of torture for her. She couldn’t even bring herself to pause the ads and then fast forward. Every black face she saw was like a knife to the heart.The number of black and brown facesdrove her mad, she said. What Sarah wants is a world of whiteness. Even a Hovis advert is a trigger for her. What’s wrong with Warburtons’ thick white sliced? That’s the proper bread for a traditional English breakfast. Even our food is now subject to diversity, equity and inclusion laws.At some point over the weekend it was pointed out to Nurse Ratched that what she had said was racist. Sarah was horrified. She had never meant to be discriminatory. She had just phrased her thoughts clumsily. When she had said that she had had enough of black and brown faces on TV adverts, what she had really meant was that she had had enough of black and brown faces on TV adverts.All of which is immensely troubling toNigel Farage. Because Nige has always been clear that Reform is no place for racists. He finds it baffling that those people who do have racist views seem to be invariably attracted to his party. He’d like to get rid of them but you can’t give everyone a questionnaire. And there will always be a few bad apples in any party.There again, the benchmark for racism in Reform may be higher than elsewhere. On Monday, Nige was in London to give a press conference on grooming gangs but the event was largely overshadowed by Pochingate. Would Nige like to condemn his MP? Maybe even suspend the whip? That would have sent out a clear marker that Reform had a zero-tolerance policy on racism.Or maybe not. When you’ve already lost two MPs inside a year, I guess Farage is in no hurry to lose a third. So Nige chose his words carefully. What Nurse Ratched had said was“ugly and unpleasant”. He had let her know what he thought in no uncertain terms. But on balance, he had decided that what she had said was not intentionally racist.She was just stating she was driven mad by seeing so many brown and black faces. This was a lower-order offence. One that was, when you came to think of it, not really racist at all. Basically, she had been right all along. Thereweretoo many black and brown faces in adverts. For Nige, this was the sort of thing we all think but just keep to ourselves. If we all happen to be like Sarah.View image in fullscreenFarage appeared with Ellie-Ann Reynolds, who has stepped down from the grooming gangs inquiry.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn grooming gangs, Nige had co-opted one of the survivors – Ellie-Ann Reynolds, who had stepped down from the inquiry – to join him on stage.Here was his plan: forget what he had said a few months ago about wanting a national inquiry. Now he had got one, he had come to realise it would take years to report, just as the government had said it would. He went on to insist the inquiry was a cover-up. Ellie-Ann said some witnesses had been paid off. We never found out who, or by whom.What Nige wanted instead was an inquiry run by a committee of MPs. While the survivors couldn’t trust social workers and the police because they had been let down by them, they could apparently trust MPs. Even though Ellie-Ann had just said she had previously also been let down by MPs.Then Nige declared he wanted to narrow down the inquiry by widening it to include all 250,000 victims. There was abuse taking place not two miles away from where we were sitting. Grooming gangs were rampant in London, he said. And it was so hard to find these gangs because … He left that sentence hanging.The implication seemed to be that there were so many Asian men in London, it was hard to pick the guilty from the innocent. In northern towns they are presumably all guilty. It was almost as if Nige was just saying the first thing that came into his head. Heaven forbid.We ended with a question on Prince Andrew. Now Nige made a plea for clemency. Andrew had had a rough time. Now was not the time to hound him. People should back off. This sounded suspiciously like the two-tier policing he has always condemned. If you’re posh and white and accused of sex offences then you deserve an even break.

Originally, it was a money-driven choice, but when I turned 15 I became acutely aware of the fashion industry’s damaging impact on the planet and the unethical labour conditions behind high-street brands. I decided that wasn’t something I wanted to be complicit in.Charity shopping became my favourite weekend activity and cheap, mismatched clothes began pouring into my ready-to-explode wardrobe. My obsession for secondhand clothes continued to grow, partly fuelled by social media and new fashion trends.When I moved to London earlier this year, I felt inspired by the big-city fashionistas around me. I was in a new place, with a new job and it was a new season to buy more clothes. I was addicted to Vinted. I scrolled at work, I scrolled in bed – sometimes it was the first thing I’d do after waking up. Shopping on Vinted became my favourite pastime and an easy dopamine hit at any time of the day.Sometimes I’d pick up my phone to reply to a text, and end up with a new top arriving and a dwindling bank account. Half the time I couldn’t remember what I’d ordered and I never felt satisfied with the clothes I had. My shopping may have been eco-friendly, but I was desperately overconsuming and that didn’t agree with my politics.The one change that worked: I was lost in the infinite scroll – until a small ritual renewed my love of readingRead moreI thought back to a traveller I met on a recent trip abroad. She’d been on the road for a year, just her and her backpack. I was intrigued by her wardrobe situation as I couldn’t get my head around wearing the same few outfits for a whole year. She explained her one in, one out policy where if she wants something new, something else has to go.Inspired, I decided to implement this into my new life in London. Adapting this approach has been a success so far. I love wearing my old clothes and styling them in a way that reflects my ever-changing taste. I truly consider new buys and dodge impulsive purchases.If I want a new item, something else goes on Vinted and I earn cash in return. If it hasn’t sold after a month or so, it goes to charity, maintaining a virtuous cycle of secondhand buying and selling. If I want to buy on Vinted, I only use what’s in my in-app pool of credit – known as your Vinted balance.As a gen Z shopper, it’s so easy to fall into overconsuming. Influencers set the bar high: no repeating outfits, only exercising in expensive sets, and retail therapy framed as a self-care ritual. But my new approach has made me more intentional about what I buy and excited about what’s already in my wardrobe.Repeating outfits doesn’t have to be boring and owning the same clothes for years should be standard practice. I’ve brought back some old charity shop buys that I hadn’t worn for ages, and now they’re some of my favourite pieces. They reflect a part of who I am, rather than a lifeless social media trend. And more than anything, mindful shopping has taught me to trust my gut, wear what makes me happy and ignore everything else.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe one change that workedDigital mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I went on holiday and Dave Cummings, who’d written for Harry Enfield and Chums, did the first draft. I came back and took over. A month later, it was all happening. It was really quick.We were given a few millionto shoot over 12 days in Ibiza. The nightclub scenes were all filmed in one day and night at Amnesia. The scene in which Kevin and Perryget puked onby some clubbers was filmed in the afternoon. We invented the Inbetweeners basically! They couldn’t shut the club in the evening, so the crowd weren’t extras. They were actual clubbers, having a good night, and the DJs were actually DJing. I said to DJs Seb Fontaine and Roger Sanchez: “Do you mind if I just come and interrupt your set?”I’d won best actress at Cannes – but most of the parts I was offered afterwards were extremely boringWhen I was that age, it was punk. We’d go and see the Clash and the Pistols. They’d be horrible to us and we’d go: “Brilliant!” I once asked Pistols drummerPaul Cook: “Can you write something funny on my trousers?” So he wrote: “Something funny.” Eyeball Paul, the character played by Rhys Ifans, is our equivalent: the nastier he is to us, the more we like him.The notorious scene in which poo goes into my mouth wasn’t in the script. Originally it was a scene where Kevin and Perry went on a boat trip with the girls, who all ignored them. But when we got to the jetty to film it, there was no sign of the boat. Ed Bye, the director, said: “What the fuck are we going to do?” We had to think of something else. I’d been swimming at the same beach a few years before and there had been a great big human poo next to me. I said: “Get a bit of polystyrene, paint it brown, put some sweetcorn on it like eyes and pull it with fishing line so it looks like it’s going in my mouth. And Kathy, you go in the water and look like you’ve just shat in the sea.”The film is fun and silly, but quite sweet because you feel sorry for Kevin and Perry. It’s very English. When they screened it in America, people hated it so much they wanted to burn the cinema down. In France, the poster read: “Kevin et Perry, un film trash.”I’m a bit too old for a sequel now. I did once write Kevin and Perry Go to Wizard School, but nobody ever replied. That’s the English film industry, I’m afraid.Kathy Burke, played PerryI’d been one of Harry Enfield’s “Chums”, playing Waynetta Slob, Lulu the Toddler and Perry. I’d just won the 1997 best actress award in Cannes forNil By Mouthwhen Harry said he might be able to get funds for a Kevin and Perry movie. Was I up for it? I thought: “Too right, mate!”I left the script to Harry and Dave Cummings. Louisa Rix continued in her role as Kevin’s mum, Mrs Patterson. Perry and Mrs Patterson have this little twinkle between them: Perry is very much in lust with Mrs Patterson and she is very much in amusement with him. It was always great fun working with Louisa.Since we were playing a couple of hormonal, randy teenagers, Harry and I were fitted with electronic penises that worked by remote control. Sexy ladies walked past and – boing! – up went the appendages. The crew were a lively bunch too, and we’d congregate in a bar at the end of a day’s filming and drink Choccy-Woccy, a lethal brandy, vodka and milk chocolate concoction that Rhys Ifans invented. It went down far too easily yet for some reason caused minimal hangovers.A Mind of My Own by Kathy Burke review – a brilliant, blunt and beautiful memoirRead moreWhen we did the press circuit, I was surprised by how many journalists asked if this kind of comedy movie was maybe a bit lowbrow. Most of the parts I’d been offered since Cannes were extremely boring – just carbon copies of my previous roles. As a woman in my mid-30s, when else would I have the opportunity to play a 14-year-old boy? It’s surprising but very lovely that, nearly 30 years on, people still talk to me about Kevin and Perry. They hold a special place in some old hearts. As Perry would say: “Fank yoo!”Harry Enfield and No Chumsbegins touringin March.

One Labour insider said the danger was “ending up with reform as a slogan rather than something people can actually touch”.His comments followed a day of unusually frank conversations among Labour MPs, many of whom privately praisedWes Streeting’s response to the byelection loss in Wales, after he told broadcasters Labour had not told a “compelling enough story” about its achievements. He compared Labour’s third place in Caerphilly to the 2021 Hartlepool byelection, which led Keir Starmer to contemplate resigning as party leader.He told the Sunday Times that Starmer “not only took that result on the chin, he took it to heart” and used it to accelerate his reform of the party in opposition.Labour’s vote share in Caerphillyfell to 11%, with Plaid Cymru surging to victory and Reform UK taking second place, splitting between an anti-establishment local sentiment and populist anger.Several MPs described the health secretary’s tone as “blunt but refreshing”, highlighting an appetite for plainer, more evocative language that cuts through the party’s cautious talk of change.Others still argue that Starmer’s sharp conference pivot, especially his moral attack on Reform UK’s “politics of division” and “racist policies”, could still prove decisive. They believe it came from a progressive place and could reset the conversation before May’s local elections.“It’s the right fight,” one MP said. “The question is whether he’s left himself enough time to win it. We need to double down, not shy away.”Explore more on these topicsLabourDavid LammyWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

Our thoughts are with him and we will fully support him,” Fairhurst told the Guardian.The suspended member of staff was responsible for going through the paperwork to ensure that the right prisoner was being released under the right conditions. However, the manager was checking paperwork that had already been processed by more senior staff, it is understood.Taylor said prisoners being released early, in error or even late was an “endemic problem” that needed to be fixed by Prison Service leaders.“I think it’s symptomatic of the chaos that we’re seeing within the system, where the number of prisoners who were released early has gone up,” he said.“Serious mistakes” had been made at HMP Chelmsford, which was a “very busy” reception prison, while an inspection at HMP Pentonville and unpublished findings at HMP Birmingham showed “serious anomalies” of sentence calculations, Taylor said.“I think it’s very easy to throw an individual at Chelmsford under the bus for this, but this is a systemic problem and the Prison Service needs to take some responsibility as well for failing to fix this issue, which has got much, much worse in the last couple of years,” he added.Fourteen days before someone’s release, a hub manager in the offender unit checks the paperwork to make sure that the right offender is being let out under the right conditions.Two days before a prisoner’s release, a governor-grade manager then checks the paperwork, the licence and the warrant to ensure that the right person is being let out.It is understood that the investigation will centre on whether Kebatu’s status as a prisoner being prepared for deportation was on the paperwork or was missed by someone responsible for carrying out checks.Allegations of sexual assault against Kebatu led toprotests and counter-protests in Epping, where he had been living in asylum accommodation, and eventually outside hotels housing asylum seekers across the country.He was found guilty of five offences after a three-day trial at Chelmsford and Colchester magistrates courts in September, and his sentencing hearing heard it was his “firm wish” to be deported.What does mistaken release of Hadush Kebatu say about state of prisons in England and Wales?Read moreAccording to government figures published in July, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year to March 2025: a 128% increase on 115 in the previous 12 months.View image in fullscreenDavid Lammy pointed to a 30% cut in prison staffing under the Conservative government.Photograph: PRU/AFP/Getty ImagesIn the Commons on Monday, Lammy confirmed stronger release checks on prisoners would come into force immediately.Prisons have been issued with a five page “ticklist” that asks officers to check prisoners’ details, as well as their “tattoos and scars” against a photograph, before they are set for release.However, the extra checks have been criticised by senior prison staff because they will increase workload and put more pressure on a system already struggling to cope.In a statement, the Prison Governors’ Association said the government must reinvest in prisons after “austerity broke our prisons”. “A checklist won’t cut it,” a statement said.Lammy said there had been a 30% cut in prison staffing under the Conservatives, and more than half of frontline prison officers now had less than five years’ experience.He said: “It’s little wonder when the system has been brought to its knees that errors like this happen. We must also be honest that the previous government’s approach to this crisis … has added to a level of complexity and pressure that makes errors more likely.”The shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the incident was a “national embarrassment”.Explore more on these topicsPrisons and probationDavid LammyCrimeEssexUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

At one point a woman turns around and tells him to “shut up”. The protester, thought to be a member of anti-monarchy group Republic, ends by asking: “Should MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?”Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, said: “The royals need to be challenged, and if the politicians won’t do the job and the police won’t investigate, then more and more members of the public will be asking the tough questions.“We want to see broadcasters invite Charles into a studio and ask him the same questions.”The monarchy has come under increasing pressure to resolve the issue of Andrew, with some MPs eager to debate the topic, though the government has so far refused to allocate time in the Commons.Earlier this month, it was announced thatAndrew would no longer use his titlesand honours after the continuing fallout over his links to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child sex offender.Andrew’s announcement came days before the posthumous publication of the memoir of his sex assault accuser, Virginia Giuffre, who died by suicide in April aged 41.In her book, Giuffre repeats her allegations,published in an exclusive extract by the Guardian, that she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions, including when she was 17 and also during an orgy after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew vehemently denies the allegations.There were further calls for action against Andrew when the terms of his residency at theRoyal Lodge, where he lived effectively rent free, were revealed. After mounting anger over his continued residence in the royal mansion with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, also linked to Epstein aftercalling him a “supreme friend”in 2011, the pair have agreed to leave in exchange for two separate residences, according to reports.An anonymous source told the Sun newspaper that Andrew has requested the former home of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Frogmore Cottage, while Sarah Ferguson may relocate to Adelaide Cottage after it is vacated by the Prince and Princess of Wales.Explore more on these topicsKing Charles IIIPrince AndrewJeffrey EpsteinMonarchynewsShareReuse this content"

By way of immediate response the club’s main – and typically publicity-shy – shareholder, Dermot Desmond, has remarkably unleashed on what he branded “self-serving” behaviour by Rodgers. In a further dramatic twist and two decades after leaving the club, Martin O’Neill will return to take charge of Celtic on an interim basis.Celtic confirmed Rodgers had left his position shortly before 10pm on Monday. O’Neill, assisted by Shaun Maloney, will preside over Wednesday’s visit of Falkirk to Celtic Park. Celtic then face Rangers in the League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park on Sunday. It is far from impossible O’Neill will be given an extended run in charge. Ange Postecoglou has been installed as the early favourite and is availableafter leaving Nottingham Forest. The likelihood of the Australian returning to Glasgow has been played down by those close to Celtic.Football Daily | Why Hearts’ historic title tilt shouldn’t come as a surpriseRead moreIt will, however, take considerable time for the dust to settle on the circumstances behind Rodgers’s exit. His final match was Sunday’s3-1 defeat against Heartsat Tynecastle, which leaves Celtic eight points from the summit of Scotland’s top flight. Rodgers had made plain his disquiet over a lack of summer transfer activity, sentiment his paymasters clearly believe fuelled supporter protests aimed at the board.Within 15 minutes of Celtic’s official statement on Rodgers, Desmond issued a savage one of his own. “I want to acknowledge Brendan’s contribution across his two spells as manager, during which he helped deliver success that forms part of the club’s modern history,” said the Irish tycoon. “However, I must also express my deep disappointment at the way the past several months have unfolded.“When we brought Brendan back to Celtic two years ago, it was done with complete trust and belief in his ability to lead the club into a new era of sustained success. Unfortunately, his conduct and communication in recent months have not reflected that trust.View image in fullscreenMartin O’Neill previously managed Celtic from 2000-2005, winning the Scottish title three times.Photograph: Ben Curtis/PA“In June, both [the chief executive] Michael Nicholson and I expressed to Brendan that we were keen to offer him a contract extension, to reaffirm the club’s full backing and long-term commitment to him. He said he would need to think about it. Yet in subsequent press conferences, Brendan implied that the club had made no commitment to offer him a contract. That was simply untrue.” There appeared little chance of Rodgers extending his deal, which was due to end next summer.Desmond added: “Every player signed and every player sold during his tenure was done so with Brendan’s full knowledge, approval, and endorsement. Any insinuation otherwise is absolutely false.”Desmond insisted Rodgers was “given final say over all football matters” and disputed Celtic’s transfer approach has been poor. “When his comments were made publicly, I sought to address them directly,” said Desmond. “Brendan and I met for over three hours at his home in Scotland to discuss the issue. Despite ample opportunity, he was unable to identify a single instance where the club had obstructed or failed to support him. The facts did not match his public narrative.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of the abuse directed at them, and at their families, has been entirely unwarranted and unacceptable.”After the loss at Hearts, Rodgers denied shifting the blame on to others. “I’ve always taken responsibility,” he said. “There’s never been a time that I haven’t. When you’re the manager at Celtic, you’re responsible for the results, despite whatever else happens.

His face received full-thickness burns after a speeding drunk driver hit him while he was out cycling with friends.He said he was “lucky to survive” the crash which also damaged his back and pelvis and caused him to break several ribs on one side of his body.While recovering, he was referred to reconstructive prosthetics, which has opened the Bristol 3D medical centre, the first of its kind in the UK to have 3D scanning, design and printing in a single NHS location.Richards, from Devon, said surgeons tried to save his eye but “they were worried any infection could spread from my eye down the optic nerve to the brain so the eye was removed”.“The decision was then made to go for free flap, taking tissue with blood arteries and veins and plumbing it into my neck, the flap completely covering the side of my face.”He called the process of getting a 3D-printed face “not the most pleasant”. He added: “In the early days of my recovery, I felt very vulnerable, and would not expose myself to social situations.“It took me a long time to feel comfortable about my image, how I thought people looked at me and what they thought of me – but I have come a long way in that respect.Describing the incident that nearly cost him his life, which took place in July 2021, he said: “It was a lovely sunny day, and not long into the ride we were going up a hill on a B road, and this guy comes up behind us at speed, and over the drunk drive limit.“He was on his phone, racing up behind us and we were all in line. He wanted to swerve around us, but there was a car coming the other way, so it was either smash into the car or smash into us.”Richards said his two friends were hit by the car and thrown clear of it but he became trapped under the vehicle. “[I] was rolled along, with the engine and exhaust burning through one side of my body and the other side being crushed by the car.”He said despite his initial “sceptical” feelings towards his treatment, he was happy he had followed through.“I’m glad I’ve followed this treatment process as it has got me to where I am today. I have always said no matter what treatment is offered, if I think there’s a benefit and the risks aren’t too high, I will try anything and have a go and that’s still the case.”Amy Davey, the senior reconstructive scientist at North Bristol NHS trust, said: “Surface scanning patients for prosthetics means that patients can be scanned while moving, and this technology can use that movement to aid the prostheses to accommodate movement.“The 3D printers used involve advanced plastic resins whose properties allow direct application to the skin, with materials that are safe against the skin for long periods.The man who struck Richards was sentenced to three years and banned from driving for seven years but it is believed he was released after one and a half years for good behaviour and for pleading guilty from the start.Richards said: “As you can imagine, I am not best pleased with his reduced sentence as I very nearly lost my life and have to live with all the pain from my injuries on a daily basis.”Explore more on these topicsNHSPlastic surgery3D printingHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump stepped in after that humiliating result, offeringa $20bn (£15bn) currency swap dealand a further $20bn in support for an economy he claimed was “dying” – although the US president indicated such “generosity” would evaporate if Milei failed to win big on Sunday.Milei’s opponents accused Trump of flagrantly meddling in Argentina’s electoral process with his explicit message to voters. Some predicted an anti-Trump backlash, similar to the one felt in neighbouring Brazil as a result ofWashington’s ham-fisted attemptto force its authorities to abandon the coup trial of the former president Jair Bolsonaro.But on Sunday night there was scant sign of voter reprisals over Trump’s intervention. If anything, some suspected the gambit might have paid off by swaying voters’ minds.Diego Guelar, an Argentinian politician and former ambassador to China and the US, voiced unease at how Trump had warned voters “they had to vote for his friend [Milei] or he would abandon them”. But Guelar thought the US president’s “direct intervention”, while “awful”, had worked, with voters accepting “the need for American assistance” and blaming the economic crisis on the opposition.Brian Winter, anArgentinaexpert who edits the Americas Quarterly magazine, said: “It has the appearance of a masterstroke by Donald Trump. He threw a lifeline to somebody who was drowning at just the right moment.”Milei’s libertarian party, La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances), captured nearly 41% of the vote – considerably higher than expected after a miserable spell of corruption scandals and growing economic crisis – compared with his Peronist rivals’ 32%. Argentina’s bonds, stocks and currency, the peso, surged on Monday as Milei celebrated what he called a vindication of his two-year-old “shock therapy” crusade.Winter was still trying to gauge the extent to which Trump’s $40bn rescue package – andpre-election admonition– had affected the result, which underlined how many voters still blamed the Peronists for years of economic chaos, even if they were increasingly disillusioned with Milei.“But the way politics works, Trump will get credit for this,” Winter predicted. “It looks like a bold bet – and not just a bold bet. The appearance, at least, is that he [Milei] showed the value of being an ally to Donald Trump. And this is a White House that is making more use of carrots and sticks in Latin America than any White House in probably 50 years.”Trump’s unexpectedly intense focus on Latin America – which also includes the highly controversial naval buildup off Venezuela’s coast,accusing Mexico’s leadersof narco ties, threateningto forcibly “take back” the Panama canal, and slapping 50% tariffs on Brazil – may not, beyond Milei’s movement, be winning him many friends in the region.But Winter believed it was, for better or worse, influencing people: “He has helped cajole the Mexicans into a more active approach on security and migration. He has convinced the Panamanians to push the Chinese out of the proximity of the canal. He appears to have backtracked on a failing strategy in Brazil – and now both sides are talking about a significant deal on rare earths, critical minerals and potentially other areas.”Trump’s distinctly 19th-century-style doctrine – “rescue packages and loans for his friends and gunboat diplomacy for his enemies” – could easily backfire over time, Winter admitted. “But for now, most of them are producing results.”Above all for Milei, now Trump’s best regional friend, who used X to thank his North American underwriter as the scale of Sunday’s victory became clear.“You are a great friend of the Argentine Republic,” Argentina’s president told Trump, before signing off with a rallying cry they now share: “Maga.”Additional reporting by Facundo IglesiaExplore more on these topicsJavier MileiArgentinaAmericasDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

That needs to change.”She haspromised a range of policiesin next month’s budget to “bear down on” rising costs, which could go some way to counteracting negative headlines about an expected swathe of tax rises to close an anticipated £20bn-£30bn spending gap.Reeves says the government must support the Bank of England in bringing down inflation and the speculation is that her target could be soaring “administered prices”, such as utility bills and transport fares, which the central bank cited in August as a crucial driver of consumer costs.So what are the chancellor’s levers for mitigating a UK inflation rate that the International Monetary Fund has warned is on a pathto be the highest in the G7 groupof countries this year and next?Cut VAT on energyMillions of households are suffering a huge financial hangover from soaring energy prices following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Gas prices have fallen over the last 18 months, but remain two-thirds higher than they were before 2020.Ministers are concerned that poor and middle-income groups are heading into another hard winter made more difficult by hefty utility bill increases.Higher water and council tax bills are already baked into the figures. Energy, on the other hand, could be reduced to save £83 a year on the average bill should Reeves reduce the 5% VAT charge on energy to zero. The energy secretary,Ed Miliband, has hinted that she will.It is tempting because VAT is spelled out on utility bills and a cut would be immediately passed on, slicing about 0.2 percentage points from the consumer prices index (CPI), which in September stood at 3.8%.Adrian Pabst, the deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, says: “This would especially help the 20% to 30% of low-income households, who spend a disproportionate amount of their income on energy.”Freeze fuel dutyEvery year, the chancellor is asked by Treasury officials to link the duty on fuel to an inflation-based escalator, adding about £4.5bn to tax receipts.The link was established by Gordon Brown to push up petrol and diesel prices and discourage short and inefficient journeys. Drivers were also supposed to realise that a more efficient car, or an electric one, would make sense in a world where fuel duty is ratcheted up each year.However, the duty has been frozen in every successive budget since 2012 and this year looks like being the same.Martin Beck, the chief economist at the consultancy WPI Strategy, says oil, which is priced in dollars, is at a four-year low when translated into pounds, giving the chancellor the perfect opportunity to add a little to prices at the pumps without doing terrible harm to household incomes.“But when the chancellor wants to signal her support for hard-pressed families, it would send the opposite message,” he said.Pabst favours a freeze this year, adding that people in the suburbs and rural communities, where public transport is scant and cars a necessity, will be hit at a time when inflation remains high.There is another way to look at the winners and losers, says the Social Market Foundation, an economic thinktank. It found that the combined impact of the fuel duty freeze and 5p duty cut in 2022 has cost the Treasury £100bn since 2011 and could knock £27bn off its coffers over five years.It found that the bottom fifth of earners would receive just 10% of the savings from a freeze, compared with the top fifth, who would pocket 24%.Limit train and bus fare increasesTrain fares in England areexpected to rise by 5.8%next year based on a calculation that adds one percentage point to the retail prices index (RPI) in July.The government has yet to confirm whether the increase for 2026 will apply to regulated fares, which account for about half of rail journeys.Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said Reeves could restrict the rise and also freeze a bus fare capthat increased this yearto £3 from £2.The chancellor could also freeze or cut alcohol and tobacco duties, though a bus fare cap is likely to gain more public sympathy.“Set against these moves is how they all give money away at a time when the chancellor is trying to make huge savings elsewhere,” Dales said.Restrict public sector pay risesReeves wants to raise living standards by bringing down inflation, but that has proved difficult. In the last year, the consumer prices index (CPI) has more than doubled from 1.7% in September 2024 to 3.8% last month.Pay growth has averaged 4.4% in the private sector in the year to August and 6% in the public sector.Kallum Pickering, the chief economist at the stockbroker Peel Hunt, says last year’s public sector pay settlements, which were well above inflation, had two side effects: they ate up the Treasury’s spare funds, and the extra money in the economy pushed up prices.There are pay disputes brewing across Whitehall,the health serviceand the rail industry that could wreck Reeves’s ability to fund tax cuts if they result in a second year of bumper awards.“Reeves needs to avoid a repeat this year,” Pickering says, pointing out that private sector wages growth is falling back rapidly.“Financial markets are also looking for the chancellor to have another crack at welfare, though not cuts to payments, more a reduction of disincentives that discourage young people from getting into the workplace,” he adds.Change the big three taxesCuts to income tax, national insurance or VAT would be very expensive and force the chancellor to raise funds in less conventional and, most likely, problematic ways. Reductions would also feed through to the economy in extra spending, which would increase inflation.However, any move to increase any of the main three taxes would come at a high political price – given the Labour manifesto pledge not to touch them, which the government has repeatedly said it will keep.There are other downsides, too. For example, a 1p rise in VAT could raise about an extra £10bn by the end of the parliament, but in the short term would push up prices and increase inflation, which would undermine the chancellor’s mission to bring down prices growth.Nevertheless, the Resolution Foundationhas suggestedthe Treasury could afford a 2p cut from employee national insurance if it offset that by increasing income tax to generate about £6bn a year in extra receipts from richer households. This is being put forward as a fairer way to raise funds because workers only pay national insurance up to a ceiling, capping their liability, while income tax is paid by all income groups and pensioners.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesBudget 2025Tax and spendingLabourEconomicsBudgetexplainersShareReuse this content"

It’s a relatable watch which makes the cosmos seem smallerJack SealeMon 27 Oct 2025 18.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 18.02 EDTShareThe documentary film-maker James Bluemel has a technique that is more radical than it sounds: he lets the people who were there at the time do the talking. His preference for frontline witnesses, rather than decision-makers who wielded influence from afar and have reputations to protect, has previously enabled his Once upon a Time strand to show unique perspectives on Iraq and Northern Ireland.Political discourse often forgets how conflict defines or destroys the lives of the innocent folk it touches, so it’s easy to see how those testimonies have value – and Once upon a Time has ended up offering big-picture analysis via their mosaics of personal experience. How will that work, though, with space exploration … an extraordinary activity only a select few choose to pursue?Once upon a Time in Space gets there, but it takes time to acclimatise to it. You expect a space documentary to be expansive and majestic; this is restrained and domestic. It starts by skipping quickly past Yuri Gagarin, Neil Armstrong and the first wave of explorers – although a clip of a ticker-tape parade for the returned Apollo 11 crew is one of many fabulous finds from the archive – and concentrates on the Space Shuttle programme, starting from the late 1970s.Two families dominate, each reflecting how the shuttles ended the dominance of white male astronauts. Anna and Bill Fisher marry in 1977, as they are going through the Nasa selection process: Anna gets in first. The birth of their daughter, Kristin, in 1983 means Anna becomes the first mother in space when she completes her initial mission the following year. Entering the shuttle programme at about the same time is Ronald McNair, an African American man whose impoverished upbringing in segregated South Carolina makes him an unlikely spaceman: “There were no Black people doing that,” says McNair’s brother Carl, his representative in this programme. “That wasn’t our world.”Ronald McNair’s story is one of triumph, as his excellence sees him ascend to the top of the space programme and his dashing demeanour – plus a generous spirit that prompts him to directly encourage other Black Americans to put aside their preconceptions of Nasa and get involved – turns him into a beloved celebrity. There is a wonderful clip of the McNair brothers’ dad, car mechanic Carl Sr, speaking with uninhibited pride about Ron to a TV news crew: “I just wish every father could have a son like I have!”View image in fullscreenGenerous spirited … Ronald McNair with the camera he used to capture footage of the first untethered spacewalk by Bruce McCandless, during the Space Shuttle Challenger mission.Photograph: BBC/KEO Films/NasaFisher’s pregnancy, however, provokes wearingly familiar sexism from the press: “Is she a good mother?” asks a 1984 newspaper article, read aloud at the time by Fisher herself. “That will be the question on millions of minds when the first astronaut mother goes up, leaving a year-old daughter behind!” That one-year-old is now CNN journalist Kristin Fisher, who is also interviewed: “It’s a fair question,” she says, “but it’s also a question that people aren’t asking the men.”The Fishers also speak about family life in the shadow of their parents’ risky vocation: Bill and Anna were told by their employers that there was an expectation that one in every 25 launches would fail. “How many other professions have an actual countdown clock to the moment when you might perish?” says Kristin. The episode is, of course, building towards January 1986 and the launch of Challenger, which explodes soon after takeoff and kills all seven astronauts aboard – including McNair. His brother Carl recalls how bewildering it was for the instant of a loved one’s death to be a global news event: “It was all over every station, over and over and over again. My brother dying.”Interesting and affecting as these memories are, they are more a case of relatable experiences – overcoming self-doubt to chase a dream career; growing up unaware of the hard choices one’s parents are facing; grieving for a family member suddenly lost – made remarkable by their unusual context, rather than the regular Once Upon a Time trick of making a complex political situation more comprehensible by showing us its simpler details. The three remaining episodes will look through a wider lens, investigating how America and Russia ended the space race by going into orbit as a joint venture, with those aboard the Mir and International Space Stations enjoying collaborations that turned enmity between superpowers into an absurd concept – until aggression down on Earth made those celestial relationships unsustainable.The more fundamental message is the one contained within Armstrong’s line about man and mankind: this handful of humans, with their ambitions and emotions not much different from anyone else’s, did something incredible on humanity’s behalf. Once Upon a Time in Space opens with a caption reminding us that an era of mass space travel might soon arrive – but watching this, the cosmos already feels a little closer.Once Upon a Time in Space aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s solidly entertaining stuff, if not the best ever adaptation of his workLucy ManganMon 27 Oct 2025 18.05 EDTShareI am not a great horror fan. After watching It: Welcome to Derry, I remember why. It’s because it’s full of horrors. Someone, please hold me.If you are a hardened It fan, I’m sure the new series – co-developed and directed by Andy Muschietti and functioning as a prequel to the 2017 filmIt, which he also directed (as he didthatfilm’ssequeltwo years later, because some people are just built differently, I guess, and don’t find themselves trying to claw their way through solid walls whenever a grinning clown shows up) – will be but a bagatelle. I’m sure the opening sequence, when you’ve barely got comfortable on the sofa, involving a picture-perfect family giving a lift to an unhappy boy and gradually revealing themselves to be liver-eating demons filling the car with blood, gore and a mutant baby swung round by its demented mother via the umbilical cord, is nothing to you. Less viscera-happy people, however, may need a moment. And also be forewarned that this isn’t even the last mutant-birth scene you’re going to see, although it’s interesting to note that the most terrible parts of each are also the most realistic. Truly, the human body has some major design flaws.Anyway. Once this pulverising opener is over, we cut to April 1962 – by which time the unhappy boy, Matty (Miles Ekhardt), has been missing from his hometown of Derry for four months – to meet the children who will make it their mission to find him. Teddy(Mikkal Karim Fidler) is a sensitive soul, conscience-stricken by the knowledge that he and his best friend Phil (less sensitive, likes boobs and theorising about aliens’ presence on Earth, played by Jack Molloy Legault) had to be bribed to attend the friendless Matty’s last birthday party. Lilly (Clara Stack) is suffering at school in the wake of her father being mangled in an accident at the pickle factory – a perfectlyStephen Kingdeath, sitting at the exact juncture of tragic and comic that enables the other kids to turn it into a bullying opportunity. Ronnie (Amanda Christine) was, with her father Hank (Stephen Rider), the last person to see Matty alive (at the cinema where they work). When the girls realise they have both heard Matty’s voice through the pipes in their homes, which come up from the sewers, and tell the boys, the investigation is on. Only briefly for some of them, alas.Meanwhile, what are the adults up to? Important secret cold-war work on the Derry airbase, that’s what! Major Leroy Hanlon (Jovan Adepo) is a newcomer who soon realises there is more going on at his new place of employment than is usual for even the very most important secret cold-war work. Also working on the base is Dick Hallorann (Chris Chalk), and if you just said: “Wait a minute – isn’t he thetelepathic man from The Shining who appears briefly in It, the novel, as the rescuer of, among others, Will Hanlon, who himself goes on to be the father of Mike, one of the main adversaries ofPennywise, that grinning goddamn clown? And wait again! SoMajor Hanlon is going to be … Will’s father? Mike’s grandad? Is that how things are starting to join up?”, I would have to say: well done you, and keep watching with your eagle eyes and clever-old cleverness!View image in fullscreenMiles Ekhardt as Matty begins to regret his choice of transport in Andy Muschietti’s It.Photograph: HBO/SkyThere is also the matter of Derry itself. Its townsfolk are racist, which must be navigated carefully by the ever-vigilant Hanlon family and makes Ronnie’s father an easy target for the police to frame as they come under pressure to find the person responsible for Matty’s disappearance, and then for a variety of other missing children – presumed dead from the amount of blood spatter and guts coating the inside of his cinema.In short, all of Stephen King’s tropes, concerns and set pieces are here. Idyllic small-town American life beneath which malevolence lurks. Supernatural horrors as a metaphor for nuclear and other human-made evils. The innocence of childhood that is no such thing. The endless, exquisite cruelties we can inflict on each other. Unsettling uncanniness brought to such a pitch that it is almost a relief when it reaches tipping point and lets the hellion babies fly free and rip the limbs off tiny victims cowering under theatre seats; or pickle jars fill with paternal body parts begging for a daughter’s kiss in a nightmarish supermarket that is probably commenting on the US’s rapacious capitalist hunger, or something.It: Welcome to Derry is not going to trouble the top tier of TV adaptations in the King pantheon (including the 1990 version of It wherein Tim Curry’s Pennywise made coulrophobics of us all) but it is solidly entertaining stuff – on a par with Under the Dome, say, rather than the dismal recent offering that was The Institute – and should give fans the nightmares of their dreams. The rest of us should hunker down and prepare for the arrival of Amazon’s take on Carrie next year. The girl’s a menace.IT: Welcome to Derry aired on Sky Atlantic and is on Now in the UK, and HBO Max in the US and Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewHorror (TV)TelevisionStephen KingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But with Elon Musk branding it ‘Wokipedia’ and AI looming large, can it survive?Mon 27 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 11.54 EDTShareWikipedia will be 25 years old in January. Jimmy Wales’s daughter will be 25 and three weeks. It’s not a coincidence: on Boxing Day 2000 Wales’s then wife, Christine, gave birth to a baby girl, but it quickly became clear that something wasn’t right. She had breathed in contaminated amniotic fluid, resulting in a life-threatening condition called meconium aspiration syndrome. An experimental treatment was available at the hospital near where they lived in San Diego. Did they want to try it?At the time, Wales was a former trader and internet entrepreneur in his mid-30s. He had co-founded a “guy-oriented search engine” called Bomis, but his real passion was encyclopedias. The money from Bomis had allowed him to found Nupedia, a free online encyclopedia written by experts – but it was proving slow to get off the ground. The laborious process of peer review meant that it only managed to generate 21 articles in its first year (among them “Donegal fiddle tradition” and “polymerase chain reaction”).Suddenly, Wales needed information, and fast. But as he searched for “meconium” on the wider web, desperate to make a better-informed decision about his daughter’s health, all he found was a mixture of first-hand accounts from strangers he had no way of evaluating and highly technical scientific papers he couldn’t understand. “It was like sifting through the debris of a bombed-out library,” he remembers. Ultimately, he and his then wife decided to trust the doctors and go with the new treatment. Their baby, Kira, pulled through. But that terrifying scramble made up his mind: Nupedia was never going to work – it was time for a different approach.We know the rest of the story: his new project, Wikipedia, founded on the principle that anyone could edit it, grew rapidly. By 2002, there were about25,000entries in the English version; by 2006, there were 1m. There are now more than 7m (the digital version of Encyclopedia Britannica has 100,000). Alongside this are 18foreign-languageversions of Wikipedia that have more than 1m articles each, ranging from Arabic to Vietnamese. It has become part of the plumbing of the internet – perhaps even more essential: Diane von Fürstenberg once told Wales that “we all use Wikipedia more often than we pee”.In an online landscape characterised by doom and division, it stands out: a huge, collective endeavour based on voluntarism and cooperation, with an underlying vision that’s unapologetically utopian – to build “a world where every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge”. It has weathered teething troubles (such as a “joke” edit that suggested a loyal aide to Robert F Kennedy was in fact involved inhis and his brother’s assassinations) to become a place in which civility and neutrality are the guiding stars, andlevels of accuracy matchthose of academic textbooks.Wales’s new book, The Seven Rules of Trust, is an attempt to distil the secrets of its success. They include things such as having a strong, clear, positive purpose (the slogan “Wikipedia is an encyclopedia” is a surprisingly powerful reminder that keeps editors honest); assuming good faith and being courteous; refraining from taking sides and being radically transparent. It’s a no-nonsense “lessons learned” book that might otherwise find itself occupying shelf space next to Steven Bartlett’s Diary of a CEO (subtitle: The 33 Laws of Business and Life) – but Wikipedia’s ubiquity, and the way it has dramatically bucked the trend of online toxicity – make it potentially far more significant.I just like doing interesting things. So I get up and I do the most interesting thing I can think of. And Wikipedia is super interesting …I meet Wales at his publishers’ offices near the British Museum in London. It’s a clear autumn morning and we sit in the Duncan Grant-inspired “author’s room” amid brightly coloured cushions and murals. He wears a creased pink linen shirt and slurps coffee while we wait for pastries. It’s the second time we’ve met – the first was at a dinner in July to give journalists a taste of the book, where he showed himself able to hold forth in front of a room of literary editors and reporters in press conference mode. Here he seems a bit more hesitant, chuckling nervously, prone to delivering answers with great big bracketed sections that make us both forget what the question was.“I’m a little bit too shy to do interviews, even though I do,” he tells me, about the process of talking to people about Seven Rules. Traces of his native Alabama have mostly disappeared from his accent after years of living in London, and there’s even the occasional English glottal stop. He moved here in 2012 to be with Kate Garvey, a former aide to Tony Blair, whom he met at the World Economic Forum in Davos. They are married and have two daughters together. “It’s a funny thing when I say that I’m shy to people, because they’re like, ‘Oh, you do a lot of public speaking’, but yeah, that’s not the same thing.” You wouldn’t call him socially awkward, exactly, but neither does he present as completely Ted Talk ready. Instead, he’s ordinary, approachable, with none of the bombast of some of his internet mogul peers.Wales turns 60 next year. His direct contemporaries include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. All of them have had profound influence on our lives, but only one of them has failed to become a billionaire.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pål Hansen/The GuardianThere’s an easy story to tell about this; that as “the good guy of the internet” Wales used his entrepreneurial skills in the service of a higher calling. What does he make of that kind of talk? “I don’t know. I mean, it’s embarrassing,” he laughs. Is there a part of him that likes the epithet, though? “Of course, no, it’s great. I mean, I’m very proud of Wikipedia.” But the idea that he renounced astronomical amounts of money in order to make the world a better place is wide of the mark. “I don’t see it like that. Early in my career, in the career of Wikipedia, a lot of journalists were asking that question, thinking I was going to be some kind of communist because, like, why would you be doing this thing as a nonprofit? But I’m not. I’m actually quite in favour of business and capitalism and all that.” (He’s currently president of Fandom, an ad-funded entertainment site that hosts user-edited pages, owned by private equity firm TPG Capital). “I just like doing interesting things. So I get up and I just do the most interesting thing I can think of. And Wikipedia is super interesting … I go and I visit with Wikipedians all around the world and go to schools and things like that. I meet prime ministers.”“And actually, on the money front,” he continues, “I live here in London. How many bankers in the City make far more money than I ever will? Loads of them. How many of their lives are dramatically less interesting than mine? I would say almost all of them.”Back in 2006, comedian Stephen Colbert did a bit about Wikipedia, saying it was the harbinger of a distortedform of reality called “Wikiality”(“if enough other users agree … it becomes true”), and encouraging viewers of The Colbert Report to introduce edits containing bogus stats about elephants. It almost collapsed the site. Fast forward to 2025 and it seems that Wikipedia might be the antidote to “alternative facts”, with lessons not just for the web, but for society more broadly.Not everyone is convinced. On the day I meet Wales, Musk suggests to his 228 million followers on X that “Wikipedia should be called Wokipedia (or Dickipedia 😂)”. It’s the latest salvo in Musk’s rolling campaign to discredit the nonprofit site and generate interest in his own “Grokipedia” project, a plan for an AI-based encyclopedia that will be “a massive improvement over Wikipedia” and “a necessary step towards the xAI goal of understanding the universe”.Musk’s hostility aside, does Wales see artificial intelligence in general as a threat? If people are increasingly relying on AI summaries, might Wikipedia’s dominance turn out to have been a blip? “I don’t think so,” he says, “but, I mean, that’s obviously on a lot of people’s minds these days.” It would be ironic, given that the site’s free licensing model means it can be used by anyone for anything – including as training data for large language models. “There are definitely threats to the web, but they’re not necessarily coming from AI,” he says. “I think the bigger threat is the rise of authoritarianism, governments, regulations, which make it harder to have a truly open global web where people are free to share ideas.” It’s true that Wikipedia is blocked in China, and faces sporadic censorship in Russia and elsewhere. Wales’s stance on this is not to give an inch –he has said: “We have a very firm policy, never breached, to never cooperate with government censorship in any region of the world.”Elon and I have been friendly. Even now, he’s much nicer to me in private than you might thinkWhat about his billionaire peers? Do they have any influence? Musk messaged him the morning after the 2024 US presidential election, not to crow over Donald Trump’s victory, but to complain about a Wikipedia article in which a friend of his was described as “far right”. When Wales checked, it had already been changed, and he judged that it was a reasonable call, though he won’t tell me whose page it was. “I mean, the circumstances were a little surprising, but it’s, you know, completely legitimate.” He says people are always messaging him saying they’ve seen something on a page that doesn’t look right. Wales will take a look, but he doesn’t hand out favours: changes have to conform to the usual rules about fairness and proper sourcing.Does he still regard Musk, the world’s richest man, as a friend? “Friends is probably a little strong. I mean, not, not that –” he sputters, editing himself in real time. “I want to be careful how I say that, only because I’ve met him maybe five or six times, so that I would be overstating to say friends. We’ve been friendly, and even now he’s much nicer to me in private than you might think. I mean, he’s got a big public persona, and that’s a little bit different from the private Elon, who I think is more thoughtful.” It’s a weird strategy, isn’t it, to be so aggressive in public, if that’s not what you’re actually like? “I don’t know. It’s a good question. I have this general rule of, like, I can’t speculate about what goes on in Elon Musk’s head. I have no idea – I’m as at a loss as anybody.”Musk’s attacks are rooted in a belief that Wikipedia has an in-built leftwing bias. In this, he joins the likes ofTucker Carlson, who recently said: “It’s an emergency, in my opinion, that Wikipedia is completely dishonest.” There’s a sense that Maga has Wikipedia in its sights.Wales is frustrated by this, but isn’t going to get drawn into a slanging match. “It’s annoying, but one of the things that I’ve said to [Musk] is if you really want to help, the right way is not to misstate the facts,” he says firmly. “Saying that Wikipedia has been taken over by ‘woke’ activists is just false. But if you think Wikipedia has some bias in it – and, of course, that’s always something we have to think about and grapple with – then going around saying it has been taken over by ‘crazed trans Hamas supporters’, or whatever you think, is doing two things. One, it’s telling kind and thoughtful conservatives that Wikipedia is not the place for you, and that’s a shame. And it’s also telling [activists], here’s your new home, which means we have to deal with them. We want to communicate to everybody that Wikipedia is not a very comfortable place for extremists. If you want to rant about things and you want to be super biased, then go on, write your own blog. What we’re looking for is kind and thoughtful people who care more about getting it right and being calm and factual.”Seven Rules is particularly strong on the importance of not taking sides, arguing that if people believe an institution isn’t neutral, trust evaporates. Crucially, that happens even if it’s biased in your favour. Wales citeswork by Cory Clarkat the University of Pennsylvania that looked at how people responded to political stands taken by all sorts of organisations, from newspapers to dental clinics to sports leagues. “When people thought a group was politicised against their own political position, they trusted the group less. No surprise there. But when people thought the group had taken sides and was politically aligned with them … they still trusted them less.”He brings up his own example: “I remember during the first Trump administration reading a hard news story in the Washington Post, which was doing great reporting, and I loved this story. But at the end, I’m like: ‘That was a rant against Donald Trump, and they interpreted every piece of evidence in the most negative possible way.’” This annoyed him even though he was on the “side” of the reporter (earlier, Wales tells me: “I really can’t bear Donald Trump, he’s just appalling.”). “Do I feel like I’ve gotten the full picture to make up my own mind, or do I feel like I’ve been fed something that I probably already agree with? I think that’s problematic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And that’s my happy place.’ Wales in 2005 in his office in St Petersburg, Florida.Photograph: Gary Bogdon/The New York Times/eyevineAt the same time, neutrality and civility has its limits, doesn’t it? I mention a clever op-ed by Larry David that made this point, calledMy Dinner With Adolf, in which the comedian imagines breaking bread with the worst man in history. He ends with the line: “I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came. Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn’t mean that we have to hate each other.” What does Wales think about the risk that, in giving a fair hearing to all sides, you can fail in the moral duty to call out real wickedness?“So I think we can make a distinction here between what I ought to do, what you ought to do, versus what anencyclopediaought to do,” he says. “Hitler is always a terrible example, but it actually is a great example in this case: it’s like, the Hitler entry doesn’t have to be a rant against Hitler. You just write down what he did, and it’s a damning indictment right there … you don’t need to add ‘PS, he’s a horrible person’. You just say: ‘These are the facts, draw your own conclusions.’” In Seven Rules, he quotes a Ukrainian Wikipedia editor who puts his personal feeling to one side to maintain the policy of strict neutrality: “The neutral facts are still on the side of Ukraine, right?”I’m not gonna go into space with my rocket. I like it here on Earth. There’s oxygenThis separation of fact and sentiment seems pretty unusual nowadays. It’s no great mystery why: in the book, Wales talks about “an entire class of ‘content creators’ who have effectively been trained by social media algorithms to play up outrage, fear, and hate at every opportunity”. Part of the reason this has happened is because of the lack of guiding principles among web 2.0’s major players. “Unlike Wikipedia, social media platforms have no purpose beyond selling eyeballs to advertisers, so there was nothing steering the development of norms toward civility and constructive conversation,” he writes.Is that inevitable, given the profit motive? Or, to put it another way: did money make the web go bad, spawning everything from democracy-destroying deepfakes to AI slop? No, says Wales. For him, the real poison is a lack of ethics. And that’s the result of poor commercial instincts, rather than commerce itself. “I’ve said this to people at Facebook: if the public becomes convinced that you’re destroying western civilisation, you’ve got a big business problem. And I think that’s proving to be true, as they’re in decline.” Other than that, he’s a “pathological optimist” and still feels pretty good about the internet in general. “Google search, the internet as a whole – like, it’s amazing, you know? So we can sometimes get a little jaded and forget that, and just say: Oh, people are being really mean on Twitter. Yeah, that’s true. So my recommendation is just don’t go to Twitter any more.”Wales enjoyed a modest but comfortable childhood in Huntsville, Alabama, the son of a grocery store manager and a schoolteacher. He spent “countless hours” reading The World Book Encyclopedia his mother had bought from a door-to-door salesman, eagerly awaiting the updates that arrived by post once a year. When he became a trader in Chicago in the 90s, he “loved it” because “it was very mathematical”. He maintains he doesn’t really envy the digital tycoons whose fortunes have far eclipsed his own. “I’m just a geek. I literally work every day in an office in my basement, right? And that’s my happy place. I’ve got my two computers, and I’ve got my treadmill. I’m not gonna go into space with my rocket. I like it here on Earth. There’s oxygen.”And while Wikipedia isn’t Wales’s cash cow, it still needs to make money. Regular users will be familiar with banners (sometimes emblazoned with Wales’s face) soliciting funds. Where do all those donations go? “Our finances are super transparent, so you can just go and look. They go to programmers, bandwidth, hardware, the tech side of things. There’s accounting, finance, legal, PR, and then we make grants.”In late 2024, using the slogan “Stop donating to Wokepedia”, various rightwing accounts (including Musk’s) shared graphs purporting to show that Wikipedia’s parent foundation spent “$50m of their total $177m budget on diversity, equity, and inclusion”. Were they referring to some of that grant money? He starts his answer with the weary “Yeahhh” of someone who’s had to patiently explain a position many times, before setting out what he sees as the bigger picture: “For a lot of people and a lot of companies, DEI is, sadly, just a tack-on, right? It’s like, ‘Oh, we need to do this thing to not look horrible’, and that’s unfortunate … for us, Wikipedia is completely global. It’s a free encyclopedia for every single person on the planet in their own language. So diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to the mission. We actually care about people who are native speakers of Swahili being active in Wikipedia, because that’s our goal: an encyclopedia for everyone. It isn’t ‘woke nonsense’. It is all about the mission.“The grants were basically outreach to groups to say: can we bring in more women editors? Can we bring in more African American editors, people who have different knowledge bases? It was 100% all related to improving Wikipedia.” He sees the criticisms as “completely invalid” and again makes the point that the online right’s scorched-earth approach to its perceived enemies makes addressing any real issues all the more difficult. “You know, I think there’s a legitimate question – we should ask ourselves this for every grant we make. Does it work? Should we do more funding like this, or less funding like this? One of the things that I always encourage in my role on the board is pilot projects, and being experimental.” He worries that this important culture of trial and error is under threat. “Throughout the whole NGO sector, throughout corporate funding of things, there’s a chilling effect going on, where work that would be perfectly sensible and valid, companies are shying away from it because they don’t want to be tarred as ‘go woke, go broke’.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pål Hansen/The GuardianIn some ways, Wikipedia has been the canary in the coalmine for many of today’s hot-button issues – rows over diversity, the use of language, concerns about anonymity, trolling and misinformation. During the pandemic, when quackery and conspiracism were rife, a group of editors made it their mission to police medical misinformation on the site. Crucially, they tried to maintain everyone’s trust while doing so, citing evidence and recording every twist and turn of the debate in the editors’ “talk” pages, which are preserved for ever. At the time,Wales said: “I think a lot of organisations can help with misinformation by simply being more transparent, more open … Just saying, ‘Well, I’m a reporter from the BBC, and I’m telling you this’, that isn’t enough to prove it to people any more … you actually have to show your work, you have to explain how you came to some conclusion.” I wonder if British politics could benefit from a similar approach. It’s an area where Wales has more than a few connections – in the run-up to the 2015 election, he was in talks to advise Ed Miliband on digital strategy; Garvey’s connections meant that Tony and Cherie Blair attended their wedding, where Alastair Campbell played the bagpipes; Alexis Kirschbaum, the editorial director who shepherded Seven Rules through to publication, is married to former culture secretary James Purnell.“For a government that actually has a massive majority,” he says of Keir Starmer’s administration, “they seem very timid and lacking in pursuing bigger ideas, and I think that is part of the problem … I would rather see them taking some bold actions that I disagree with than just sort of dithering around and not getting anything done. Be more clear about what it is that you are going to accomplish, and then actually do it.”It’s tempting to ask what the nerd in the basement is doing offering advice to an elected government. But the improbability of what he’s achieved – an information-sharing platform based on cooperation in an era of profound polarisation – may mean that he’s worth listening to. Does he feel as if he’s in “legacy mode” now, passing on what he’s learned to the world? “I mean, in part yes, in part hopefully no. I remember there was a Wired magazine story probably 15 years ago that said something like: ‘He doesn’t need to do anything else.’ Well, hold on! I’m still very active.” Is it annoying to always be “the Wikipedia guy”? “It’s not a bad guy to be, so it’s OK,” he chuckles. “In 100 years’ time, when people look back on this era, they’re going to look at the Wikipedia community and say, ‘Well, that was actually quite a crazy time, and there was a little oasis of nice people doing something good.’”And then there’s family – his daughters Ada and Jemima, with Garvey, and, of course, Kira. How is she doing, a quarter of a century later? “Kira is fantastic. She’s turned out great. She’s into airplanes. She came to visit, and I got her a pilot lesson, you know, just a trial lesson, for fun. She loved it.” And she never says: ‘Dad, why didn’t you monetise your massive website?’ “No, no, no,” he laughs. “She’s like me. She’s a super geek.”The Seven Rules of Trust: Why It Is Today’s Most Essential Superpower is published by Bloomsbury on 28 October (£22).

This can affect how rested we feelShayla LoveMon 27 Oct 2025 13.47 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 14.04 EDTShareIn 2018, Hannah Scott, a sleep researcher at Flinders University, waited for a woman to fall asleep.This can take time when the subject is connected to equipment measuring brain activity, eye movement, heart rate and muscle activation. But about 30 minutes after the woman closed her eyes, Scott saw the telltale signs of sleep from the electroencephalogram, or EEG: a shift to lower-frequency brainwaves.The woman progressed into deep sleep, and “was there for quite a while”, Scott said. Then, the woman suddenly woke up, saying she had to go to the bathroom. As Scott detached her from the machines, the participant apologized, saying she felt terrible she hadn’t been able to fall asleep yet.“She was absolutely adamant that she hadn’t slept,” Scott said, who had just watched her sleeping.When a person is sleeping, but doesn’t know they are, this is called sleep state misperception. If woken up, a person will say they were awake the whole time.It’s a frequent issue in insomnia, said Matthew Reid, a neuroscientist and sleep researcher at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. An insomniac may say they have barely slept, but when tested in a sleep lab, they might actually be sleeping a normal number of hours per night. This leads to a conundrum: how does someone feel rested when they are sleeping enough – but just not realizing it?This experience, which afflicts a significant number of insomniacs, has had various names: paradoxical insomnia, subjective insomnia, sleep state misperception and, most recently, subjective-objective sleep discrepancy.By any name, the phenomenon reveals that we don’t always know when we’re asleep or awake, and that our beliefs about sleep influence how rested we feel. At the same time, researchers are finding that people with paradoxical insomnia may not be entirely wrong; there may be something real that lies between sleeping and wakefulness.What is paradoxical insomnia?Paradoxical insomnia is a subcategory of insomnia. People with it report that they only sleep a few hours a night and don’t feel rested. But sleep studies show they are getting more sleep than that – sometimes even a typical amount.People with insomnia seem to suffer from straightforward problems: trouble falling asleep, staying asleep and getting enough sleep to feel rested. Their sleep issues make them tired during the day; they have difficulty concentrating, and feel irritable and grumpy.But total sleep timedoesn’t always differ by muchbetween healthy sleepers and people with insomnia. On average, according to one meta-analysis, insomniacs sleep just23 minutesless per night than healthy sleepers. If time asleep isn’t the whole story, what is?Of course, some people need more sleep than others. But it turns out some people don’t perceive their sleep accurately. They do not seem to remember that they did sleep. They may sleep a full night, but not feel rested. These studies revealed that insomnia can be a more complex experience than it appears.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’In 1959, French doctorsfirst describeda patient whose observed sleep time didn’t match up with how many hours she thought she slept. The doctors named the conditionfausse insomnieor false insomnia, and believed it was caused by her being overly worried about sleep. Since then, many sleep doctors and researchers have noticed that insomniacs’ sleep complaints don’t always align with the amount of sleep they are observed to get.Researchers don’t have a unified estimate of exactly how prevalent paradoxical insomnia is because it has multiple names. But it’s far from rare, Reid said. Bysome accounts, about half of people with insomnia sleep less than six hours a night, while the other half sleep more than six hours, an amount comparable to good sleepers’ sleep time.Who experiences paradoxical insomnia?Many people – even good sleepers – may think they’re still awake in the early stages of sleep. But people with paradoxical insomnia are more likely to think they’re awake after the first two hours. They are also more likely to report feeling awake during REM sleep, when almost all good sleepers will report accurately that they were sleeping. Inserial awakeningstudies, people with insomnia who are woken up multiple times throughout the night will report being awake when they had actually been asleep more often than good sleepers.Thomas Andrillon, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute, has a hunch that awareness during sleep is more nuanced than previously believed. In experiments aboutmemory and learning during sleep, he would see someone sleep, confirmed by their brain activity in real time. Afterwards, they would insist they hadn’t slept. Andrillon realized he had experienced this himself, and that plenty of others did, too – such as his students, who would fall asleep in class, but have no idea they had drifted off.Most people have gone through this, even if they’re not insomniacs. For instance, when I’m trying to sleep before an early morning flight, I usually feel like I haven’t even slept an hour. Yet I can recall a dream about, say, sleeping through my alarm, which tells me otherwise. I’ve sat next to a family member on an overnight flight who peacefully passes out, only to arrive at our destination and complain they didn’t sleep.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But brain imaging done by Andrillon and his colleagues is suggesting that insomniacs with discrepancies between their sleep and wake times might not be entirely wrong. Instead, they might be noticing a unique altered state of consciousness.Sleep researchers determine someone is sleeping when they lose awareness of the world around them, and when their brain activity shifts to high-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations. EEG readouts will feature sleep signatures like slow waves and sleep spindles, or specificburstsin activity.But commonly used observational techniques might miss the nuances of brain activity during the transition into sleep, or the moments between sleep stages, Andrillon said. The technology might not be sensitive enough to capture “wake-like” brain activity that could explain the feeling of being awake while sleeping. Andrillon said that when other researchers have studied deeper areas of the brain, they foundsigns of arousal, even when people seemed asleep.“The fact that they look like they’re sleeping is true only at a superficial level,” Andrillon said. “When you dive a bit more in the details of the brain activity, you see signs of wakefulness that you will typically not see during normal or standard sleep.” Experts are now shifting to the term subjective-objective sleep discrepancy, or SOSD, rather than paradoxical insomnia or sleep state misperception.Ina studyfrom March, in a group of more than 800 people with insomnia, 24% had subjective-objective sleep discrepancies. Andrillon and his colleagues found differences in the physiological profile between the two kinds of insomniacs. People with SOSD didn’t wake up very often, but when they did, their waking state was tainted with signatures of sleep, which could influence their judgment about not sleeping well or not having slept, he said. Conversely, the sleep of insomniacs without SOSD had wake-like features, meaning their sleep was of a lesser quality.Are there solutions for paradoxical insomnia?CBT-I, or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is a well-researched and effective way to improve sleeping habits. It seems to help people with SOSD, too. In astudyfrom last year, Scott and colleagues found CBT-I had no difference in positive outcomes for people with regular insomnia, compared with those who had SOSD. Other studies have shown that CBT-Icanimprove issues related toSOSD.It won’t be useful to become overly worried about whether you’re getting the perfect amount of sleep, Scott said. There is an association between SOSD and anxious or worried thoughts about sleep, so try not to pile on additional worries. “People who have [SOSD] tend to have certain thoughts, very often involving rumination about worries of the day, worries of not sleeping, not being able to sleep,” Andrillon said.Instead, a helpful tool for paradoxical insomnia could be a strategy called paradoxical intention, which encourages poor sleepers to stop trying so hard to sleep.Previously, people who could not tell they were asleep were perceived to have flawed judgment. Actually, SOSD is a reminder that we don’t know everything about what it means to be asleep, and to know that we have slept. “We’re going back to it and seeing that it’s actually pretty real,” Andrillon said. “We have just been overlooking this aspect of sleep.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyThe secrets of sleepSleepHealthHealth & wellbeingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But instead of wrapping it in toilet paper and tossing it into a bin, she put the tampon in a special plastic sample container, screwed the lid on tight and mailed it to an address in Oakland, California.The address was that of NextGen Jane (NGJ), a Bay Area-based startup founded in 2014. And now Julia Carr, NGJ’s clinical research coordinator, stands in the company’s lab under a fume hood happily decanting a mixture of the woman’s blood and a preservation solution into a test tube. She will go on to pipette out small amounts to freeze and store for later analysis. NGJ has obtained about 2,500 menstrual blood samples this way – from women volunteering to send in their used tampons – for its research. That Carr is dealing with their period blood does not gross her out in the slightest. “This is a beautiful project for women’s science, and we are exploring a novel sample type,” she says.[Menstrual blood] is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasureChristine MetzNGJ is one of a handful of small, mostly women-led “femtech” startups that, alongside a few academic research teams, are in a race to develop blood tests using menstrual effluent collected non-invasively at home. Usually, we use urine, saliva and, of course, blood drawn from our veins to test for a range of medical conditions. The FDA-approved Cologuard test allows people to collect their own feces and send them off for screening for colon and rectal cancer. These groups ask: why not also a fluid that half the world’s population produces monthly for a long stretch of their lives?The big emphasis is on diagnosing gynaecological and reproductive health conditions for people who send in their period blood for analysis. But that blood could also be used to help track hormones, screen for cancers, monitor diseases such as diabetes and boost stem cell research. If Theranos became shorthand for Silicon Valley junk science, its proponents put menstrual-blood testing at the other end of the spectrum: an underexplored sample source whose clinical potential is only now being examined with scientific care.View image in fullscreenNextGen Jane’s collection kit.Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane“It is an obvious biological specimen that has been totally neglected,” says Christine Metz, who co-leads the Research OutsmartsEndometriosis(Rose) project out of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health. “It is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasure.”No one had given much thought to analyzing menstrual effluent – which contains a mix of tissue from the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) as well as circulating blood and vaginal fluid – for the purpose of medical testing until the mid-2010s, when the Rose project and companies such as NGJ arrived on the scene. (“You matter PERIOD,” reads a tag in one of the stalls of NGJ’s arty, graffiti-decorated bathroom.) Whatlittle work that had been done to test period blood beforewas mostly concerned with distinguishing menstrual from circulating blood, for police forensic purposes.That it was overlooked for so long is not exactly surprising to those in the field. Women – their bodies, their health concerns – have been understudied due to a combination of historical exclusion from clinical research, persistent gender bias and societal stigma around menstruation and reproductive health. Much to do with women’s health research is woefully underfunded.An “ick” factor has slowed research with menstrual blood specifically, according to Renate van der Molen, an immunologist at Radboud University medical center in the Netherlands who uses the fluid to study various gynecological conditions. “It is thought of as dirty, a bit stinky and useless … People hesitate to give a sample,” she says.Yet tapping menstrual blood makes sense, she says. Not only is it non-invasive and easy to obtain but, most importantly, it is unique in that it contains cells and molecules that reflect the state of a uterus. It can deliver messages to doctors that other bodily fluids may not. It is just “so different” from blood drawn from a vein, says Van der Molen.All told, the startups and research groups see huge potential, even if it is early days. And one of the holy grails the field is hotly pursuing is endometriosis.Diagnosing endometriosisHaving an easy test for diagnosing endometriosis would be a breakthrough, says Abigail Trotter, a 23-year-old living with endometriosis from Pennsylvania. That’s why she sent her period blood to NGJ.From 24/7 pain to tolerable symptoms, Botox is helping people living with endometriosisRead moreEndometriosis – in which tissue similar to the uterus’s endometrial lining grows outside the uterus in spots known as lesions, causing severe pelvic pain and heavy bleeding, and making it harder to get pregnant – is a debilitating disease. It is estimated to afflict more than 10% of women of reproductive age. Not only is there no cure and limited treatment options, but confirming a diagnosis can be a nightmare: the only way to do it is via laparoscopic surgery, typically performed under general anaesthesia. Because endometriosis presents differently in different people and its symptoms resemble those of other conditions, it can take years to even get to the surgical diagnostic stage.Trotter was surgically diagnosed with endometriosis late last year, after nearly a decade of pelvic pain and period problems. “All the years you go without it being diagnosed it is spreading, wreaking havoc on your inner parts,” she says. The surgery itself resulted in an under-the-skin infection that laid her so low she missed six weeks of work at the veterinary clinic where she is employed as a technician. (She recently underwent further surgery to remove her lesions robotically and is recovering well.) “A surgical procedure just to have it diagnosed … [That] really does need change,” she says.Trotter came across NGJ’s work while recuperating from her diagnostic surgery andgot in touch to receive a collection kit. She wanted to help other women avoid what she went through.Developing a non-invasive, at-home test for endometriosis became NGJ’s main focus in 2021, though the company had been asking menstruators to mail in their used tampons for much longer.After receiving enough samples, the company started hunting for molecular signals of gynaecological conditions by analyzing DNA, RNA and proteins. Particularly strong differences in messenger RNA, the molecule that tells cells which proteins to make and when, between women with and without endometriosis stood out.View image in fullscreenRidhi Tariyal.Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane“We leaned in,” says co-founder and CEO Ridhi Tariyal, noting that the company has fine-tuned its collection kit and is now confirming the approach works. (She remained tight-lipped about which exact biomarkers NGJ is focused on.) Tariyal adds that NGJ’s trove of stored samples provides it with a “jumping-off point” to explore other molecular signals for different gynaecological conditions in the future.Other players such as the Rose project are trying to develop a test for endometriosis using a predominantly cellular rather than molecular approach, looking for abnormalities in the whole live cells in the period blood of people with the disease. There are differences in the quantity and shape of certain cells in women who have endometriosis versus women who don’t, explain Metz and her co-lead Peter Gregersen. “From that combination we can develop a diagnostic,” says Metz.Rather than tampons, the Rose project collects samples with menstrual cups, so it can get the whole live cells. (Indeed, the perception that period blood is just dead material is wrong.)So does Katherine Burns, an associate professor of environmental and public health sciences at the University of Cincinnati, who is also working on a test for endometriosis based on a different set of cellular abnormalities, and who herself lives with endometriosis.Yet menstrual cup collection, as it stands, could be a barrier. The cups can be messy, prone to spills and difficult to insert and remove, particularly for someone who has pelvic pain or has not had their period long (endometriosis starts in the teenage years, and the earlier the condition can be diagnosed the better). Developing a more comfortable and less spillable cup is a goal, say Metz and Gregersen.Beyond endometriosis, proponents point to several gynaecological conditions that menstrual blood could help diagnose – including other disorders of the endometrium such as adenomyosis and chronic endometritis, as well as fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome, and ovarian and endometrial cancers. Many of these conditions also go undetected for years and, in some cases, can only be confirmed through invasive procedures such as an endometrial biopsy.Ultimately whichever method proves to be best at detecting endometriosis and when it might become available to buy remains to be seen. All require further studies, including in teens, and none are yet seeking regulatory approval. (While full FDA approval is the gold standard, there is a less tightly regulated but still legitimatepathwaythat allows companies to bring tests to market more quickly.)Nonetheless, the good news for those with endometriosis, Burns notes, is that there are multiple irons in the fire. “We are all working towards the same goal to help diagnose endometriosis without surgery,” she says. “Do I hope and wish and pray that any of them are correct? You bet.”Making testing a realityBeyond endometriosis, some startups and research groups are experimenting with a grab bag of other conditions and period blood collection techniques.German startup Theblood, founded in 2022, is exploring how to use period blood collected via a menstrual cup to provide women with health status reports. It envisages an at-home test for hormone levels related to fertility, cycle health and perimenopause, typically done via a standard blood draw. It is also looking at inflammation markers with the aim of identifying patterns that might point toward chronic conditions earlier, and has studied using menstrual blood tomonitor vitamin levels.[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s healthSara NaseriIn May, researchers at ETH Zürich in Switzerlandunveiled a prototype menstrual padwith a non-electronic sensor that changes color in the presence of certain proteins in menstrual blood that could indicate disease, including potentially cancer.Then there is Qvin, another ambitious Bay Area-based startup also founded in 2014, which may be farthest ahead in the race to make menstrual blood testing a reality.Last year, the company became the first to receive FDA approval for a special menstrual pad and test for women already diagnosed with diabetes to track blood sugar levels – an A1C test but using period blood rather than blood from a vein. The pad has a special collection strip where a small amount of blood pools and dries before it is mailed in to Qvin for analysis.However, Qvin has stopped offering the test directly on its website for the time being and pivoted to include a different market: governments and health organisations, particularly in the global south, seeking inexpensive and more convenient ways of detecting diseases for the millions of women they serve.“[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s health,” says co-CEO Sara Naseri. “We can make it easy for women to get information about what’s going on in their body, and get it early.”View image in fullscreenQvin’s standing kit and Q-pad for blood sample collection.Photograph: Courtesy of QvinBut only if Qvin’s pads are able to test a menstrual blood sample for more conditions than diabetes. It is selling its pad system to research institutions and large healthcare companies to encourage the development of more tests, including for endometriosis, and looking into getting additional FDA approvals of its own, like a test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), which is linked to cervical cancer and currently screened for with a Pap smear, and another for various sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Indeed, it hasalready secured approval in Thailandfor the former. A big advantage of the pad over tampons or cups is it is the most widely used menstrual product worldwide, says Naseri.Kate Clancy is a biological anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she is using period blood to study endometriosis lesions, as well as author of the book Period,which investigates the overlooked science of menstruation.She has watched with interest as the field unfolds. Some of what she sees, she likes – including using period blood to test for endometriosis. “Conditions that actually affect the uterus I absolutely see a use case; it totally makes sense,” she says.But she is skeptical of menstrual blood testing where a standard blood test already exists, such as A1C for diabetes or hormone testing to assess reproductive health. “Why wait until a person menstruates?” she says, adding that if an argument for the menstrual blood tests is that they increase women’s access to healthcare, the real answer lies in addressing the societal issues that limit access.She also raises a broader concern: while diagnostic tests provide clear answers, definitively confirming or ruling out conditions, a wave of new menstrual blood-based screening tests – which might, for instance, flag signs of cancer or STIs in healthy populations – could end up being burdensome, adding extra steps to confirm results and potentially needless anxiety.And she urges caution around menstrual blood tests marketed more for health and wellness rather than medical purposes. Because they are not making medical claims, they are often less regulated and may sell insights about hormone balance or vitamin levels that have not been clinically validated.“We are a ways from good translational work,” Clancy says.A potential stem cell sourceThere is a “medical miracle” that happens once a month in women’s bodies, when the endometrial lining that is shed during menstruation regenerates, thickening explosively as new blood vessels sprout from existing ones, says Thomas Ichim, a scientist and biotech entrepreneur who co-authoreda 2007 paperon the discovery of stem cells in menstrual blood. It is stem cells in the endometrium – some of which slough off into period blood – that drive that process. “It’s logical to think that you can use those cells to stimulate blood vessel production in somebody else,” Ichim says.In other words, menstrual fluid does not just have diagnostic and screening potential.Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than thatBrendan HarleyThe big promise of stem cells is that one day they will be used by doctors to regenerate damaged tissue. (To date,virtuallyallstem cell-based therapies are experimental.) And when they were first discovered in menstrual blood, a flurry of research began exploring applications for treating gynaecological disorders, among other diseases.Theoretically, menstrual blood could be a plentiful source of stem cells: donors could give by menstrual cup instead of undergoing an invasive biopsy to harvest them from bone marrow, as is practice now.But little of the initial increase in research ever advanced; according toone recent estimate, just 0.25% of the adult stem cell research in recent years has involved menstrual blood-derived stem cells. Without a solid understanding of their basic utility, these stem cells are probably decades away from yielding therapies, says Brendan Harley, a tissue engineer also at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (he and Clancy are married).View image in fullscreen‘Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,’ says researcher Caroline Gargett. ‘[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.’Photograph: Andrew Brookes/Getty Images/Image Source“Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than that,” he says.Fundamental work, he believes, is being held back in the US by the lack of funding and that ick factor– that anything related to menstrual blood is seen as dirty. “I think it has permeated folks’ thinking about using it for regenerative medicine,” Harley says.In 2004, researcher Caroline Gargettpublished her discoveryof stem cells in the human endometrium, setting the scene for their later discovery in menstrual blood. These days Gargett, who works at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia, uses stem cells from the endometrium in her own work: helping treat pelvic organ prolapse. She says they have greater regenerative potential and longer-lived effects than those in menstrual blood, though getting them requires invasive endometrial biopsy. “A lot of people have just gone, ‘well let’s try,’ with stem cells in period blood, without really understanding” the intricacies, she says. (For instance, menstrual blood contains a mixture oftrue stem cells and stem cell-like cells, making it more challenging to isolate a pure, reliable sample.)Yet she envisions an alternative use for menstrual blood. She would like to grow tiny, personalized models of the uterine lining for women with endometriosis, so-called “organoids”, from the fragments of endometrial tissue in their period blood. Each woman’s “miniorgan” would be stored in a ‘menstrual fluid biobank’ and used to test how they respond to different drugs.“Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,” Gargett says. “[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.”Stained panties, male guards and no privacy: what it’s like to have your period in prisonRead moreFunding remains the biggest hurdle for period blood testing, say those in the field. While NGJ and Qvin, the Bay Area companies, have bagged roughly $20m in funding each since their inception over a decade ago, it is a small sum compared with vast amounts of cash sloshing around in Silicon Valley. The Rose project has no funding in place for the work of developing a better menstrual cup. Burns has had to pause development on her test for endometriosis because it is unfunded. Gargett has not yet secured funding for her biobank, though she continues to try.In a spot of good news, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched a $10mmenstruation science initiativeearlier this year. “This is frontier science,” says Linda Griffith, director of MIT’s center for gynaepathology research and the initiative’s leader.Meanwhile, NGJ wants to keep the flow of blood incoming: as the startup’s CEO Tariyal, not one to miss an opportunity, says: “If you’re thinking about how you can contribute, give us your tampon.”"

It was reported as if it would be ofreal consequenceto his political future – but enough time has passed, I figure, to confirm that it was not. Why did some seriously consider this a turning point? Because Jenrick had said something genuinely explicit and unambiguous – no dog whistle, no gesture, no disguise, no metaphor. Though he claimed “it’s not about skin colour”, it was a naked reference to race and an evident rebuke to British communities where there was a predominance of people of colour.The lack of consequence, however, was unsurprising, because within the public sphere the question of racism has been rigged for quite some time and the rules around who gets to say what about race in Britain have been rewritten. What Jenrick did, then, was to truly test the boundaries by outraging them – and signal what those in public life can now get away with saying after a concerted effort to erode the dignity of public racial discourse. His colleagues have wasted no time in answering this call. Katie Lam, a so-calledrising star of the Conservative party, last week called for legally settled familiesto be deportedto make the UK “culturally coherent”. How quickly the goalposts move.Public discourse on race has never been free from defensiveness, denial and attempts to undermine it. But still, over the years, as the prevailing ideology of the mainstream right has been reconfigured, so too has its approach to race. The old one-nation Tories still bought into a liberal consensus – that there was such a thing as systemic disadvantage against racial minorities, and this was reflected across key areas of policy, from health to justice to education.David Cameron had no issues publicly discussing racism. If anything, it was a key feature of his modernisation of the right. It even put himat odds with Oxford Universitywhen, in stating that the low number of Black students matriculated there was “disgraceful”, he misled on the real figures. He went on to bluntly say that Britain “still has a problem with racism” and work cross-party with David Lammy to tackle racial biasin the justice system. Theresa May didn’t mince her words on race and racism, either: during her time as home secretary, she criticised the police force for being “too white”. May was, to my mind, the only home secretary and prime minister to take seriously the fact that police powers, particularly on stop and search, needed reform because of theirmisapplication to Black men. Years after her premiership, May would say that she was “woke and proud”.This is not written in praise of Cameron or May. Austerity politics had a disproportionate impact onminority communitiesand May’s hostileimmigration legacy includesthe Windrush scandal, one of the greatest modern injustices against Black Britons (though I wonder how much public outcry there would be if this story broke today). These are deprivations and harms that cannot be forgiven simply because they acknowledged the existence of racism. And yet, they acknowledged it. There was some recognition of reality, and some level of consensus that Britain must work better for Black people and other minorities.So how did the right shift the dial so drastically that racism became the great unsayable? Well, resentment brewed. The idea that ethnic minorities and particularly Black people were beginning to enjoy some kind of special consideration took hold. In 2012, Linda Bellos, then chair of the Institute of Equality and Diversity Practitioners, warned of this when May looked tojettison parts of the Equality Act– specifically, to repeal a clause that imposed a “socio-economic duty” on authorities. Bellos said: “People will get the impression that black people have additional advantages … because this government walked away from something that could have been beneficial to the white working class.”Irrespective of this, under austerity and decades of neglect the white working classes, as well as other working-class communities, did get poorer. But the idea of whiteness as an axis of disadvantage was premised on the outcome of white school pupils, whopersistently underperformedcompared with their peers from other ethnic groups. The idea of a cohesive disaffected “white working class” that was the specific victim of racial injury became popularly deployed by politicians in the late 2010s,sowing divisionbetween disadvantaged groups and even driving andobscuring the reality of inequalityin certain regions in the UK, particularly after Brexit.View image in fullscreen‘The discourse on race became increasingly narrow during Boris Johnson’s premiership.’Photograph: Victoria Jones/PAAll the while, the mean position of the right in Britain became further entrenched in anti-migrant sentiment, adopting a growing notion that Britain was not working for its “native” population. There was no “white privilege”: in fact, too many privileges and advantages had been conferred ongroups that were “other”. The conversation around race and racism became increasingly dislocated from examinations of systemic bias or oppression, and fixated on individuals and the label of “racist” as a means of character assassination. This trend was particularly prominent during Boris Johnson’s premiership, where assessments of his “rightwing provocation” focused on past statements about Muslim women wearing burqas being like “letterboxes”, andlanguage used in a 2002 articlereferring to “flag-waving piccaninnies” and tribal warriors with “watermelon smiles”. These were unambiguously racist statements. And yet the media obsession with them indicated a narrowing of the discourse on race: it became a question of what someone thinks and feels, which is moredifficult to ascertainbecause few public figures admit to being racist, rather than of the real material effects of racism, which became increasingly marginalised.So now here we are, in 2025, facing an onslaught of racially charged rhetoric around migration, communities and integration, with the public sphere totally gutted of its faculties to deal with it. That is because racism has become thoroughly detached from “serious” politics. To discuss it is ridiculous, protest-y, an inconvenience. And not a single claim or allegation of racism is allowed to pass without a confected frenzy over how charged it is to even raise the subject. Last month, when the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, was asked if she thought Nigel Farage was racist, she said that he was “worse than racist” for his dog-whistle politics. On similar lines, Lammy claimed that Farage “flirted with Hitler Youth” as a schoolboy (he was forced to walk back from this statement). What was apparent from the public reaction to these comments was the belief not only that it was wrong to level what has been reduced to a petty, personal jab at a political opponent, but also that it was an unserious matter. Borders, Channel crossings,“Boriswave” migration: those are real areas of concern to British people. What flirtations Farage, or Johnson, have had with racist language are not. And racism is reduced to that: language. Not outcomes in education, health, employment or justice. Of course, within this rigged arena, Jenrick experiences no consequences for talking about a lack of white faces. The question isn’t what discipline he might face but, having come out unscathed, how much further can he go?This has been one of the key successes of British ultra-conservatives – the question of race can confidently be undermined in the public sphere. It is evidently burdensome for even Keir Starmer –delayed and limp as he wasafter the summer of riots, and the recent far-right demonstrations in Westminster – to name racism and provide reassurances to people of colour in the UK. Meanwhile, the right has set its sights on burning down any movement for the progress or systemic correction for the outcomes of British minorities. Why else would Rupert Lowe, who was elected the Reform MP for Great Yarmouth and now sits as an independent, be so fixated on the existence of the 10,000 Black Interns Foundation, which provides paid work experience and internships to Black students and graduates? Lowe revels inthe word “racism”being stripped of its meaning and power, yet he describes the programme as “racist filth”, and the Spectatorbacks him up. The reality is that the legal profession continues to suffer from “chronic underrepresentation of Black talent” – but in this inverted reality where“two-tier justice” mythsprevail even where there is real, evidencedanti-Black racism in policing, facts are of no relevance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t want to ruminate on whether it’s better or worse to say these things on a TalkTV phone-in than at a private dinner. I don’t want to speculate on why shadow home secretary Chris Philp was happy to tell Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday that he wouldn’t have used Pochin’s “language”, yet was unable to call her racist. (He later told Times Radio: “Yes, it was racist.”) I don’t want to wonder which bits of the language he wouldn’t have used, if not for the racist bits. I don’t want to dive into the new bigot-ology – like Kremlinology, only less rewarding – where smart liberal minds apply themselves to what kind of advantage Conservatives and Reform MPs might seek, when they nudge right up to race hate then back away at the last minute, squirming in the margin of space they’ve created for themselves with their meaningless caveats. I don’t want to go near any of this bad-faith slurry, but the problem with racists is that if you ignore them, they don’t go away.It feels like decades now, because it is, that we’ve spent discussing just how racist you’re allowed to be in public before you get “cancelled”. Since Michael Howard’s “are you thinking what we’re thinking?” election campaign in 2005, with its whiny, arse-covering rider – “it’s not racist to impose limits on immigration” – doing nothing to alter its poisonous innuendo (“are you secretly thinking people of colour are not as good? Shhh, don’t say it, just join our warm, silent embrace”), we’ve been pointlessly engaging on what the angry people aren’t allowed to say. If cancellation worked, how come getting cancelled is often so lucrative? Since when did we all have to start demonising migrants to prove we’re listening to “legitimate concerns”? How is it that calling someone racist is now more verboten than being racist?This is all the free speech debate ever was: a battle to establish the worst possible thing we could say about one another. Can I say you don’t belong? Can I say you don’t exist? Can I say you give me the ick when I see you on the telly? Can I say there are too many of you in Birmingham? If you ask me to stop thinking it, you’re the thought police. If you ask me to think it but not say it, you risk my wrath, which you’ll pay for at the ballot box. Just do yourself a favour and surrender to the new normal, in which nastiness is the highest value.Freedom of speechis an absolute liberty: it either trumps everything or it means nothing. And nobody ever needed freedom of speech to say something nice.Nigel Farage is cosying up to the US anti-abortion group that challenged Roe v Wade. Women in Britain should know that | Zoe WilliamsRead moreThe debate is always changing its focus. It can camp for months on the issue of whether Graham Linehan is right to publicly obsess about trans people, then suddenly move to Elon Musk’s God-given right tocall for a civil war in the UK, but free speech’s subject is always the same: it only wants to talk about itself. While we roll around in the mud with this pig, we never check back in with what we used to expect from “unfree” speech: debate whose purpose was other than to demean and insult one another.Discourse that is conducted through a prism of civility, rather than freedom, has a lot of generosity in it. People want to share their expertise, they want to represent their perspective persuasively, they’re open, they’re often thoughtful or funny. You know you’re debating a thing, rather than the freedom or otherwise to say the thing, because there’s a lot of love in the room. And that isn’t because you all agree; it’s because it’s not possible to meaningfully communicate – say what you mean, listen to others – without generating warmth.While we wrangle over whether Pochin represents the rock bottom of racist language, or whether there’s still more-racist she could have been, some warped idea of fair-mindedness chases us into a cul-de-sac of self-doubt. Free speech as a device has mashed all opinion into one qualitative mulch, in which nobody has the right to say any view is any more interesting, more generative, more authentic or more enriching than any other. But we can see that this is wrong; we can see that racism is worthless. This is the real cost of the free speech debate – so distracted by what is and isn’t permissible, we’ve forgotten how to state the bleeding obvious.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The then US ambassador, Spruille Braden, had other ideas about who should win the national election that year, and he openly campaigned against Perón in Buenos Aires. Braden’s action stands out as one of the most brazen instances of US interference in Argentina’s politics.Until now.The Argentine president, Javier Milei, whowon a resounding midterm victoryon Sunday, has received ample support from Donald Trump. Ahead of the congressional elections, Trump endorsed Milei and warned: “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.” Washington extended a$20bn currency swap lineto the government – money aimed at stabilising financial volatility that would have undermined Milei’s chances. The US treasury even intervened directly, buying more than abillion dollarsof pesos to slow the currency’s freefall in recent weeks.Trump’s bailout of Argentina is not an act of economic prudence (economists across the spectrum sayit makes no sense), but of ideological finance. The goal is to shore up an ally in the US’s back yard and discredit opponents, especially the leftwing Perónist tendency in Argentinian politics that Trumpequates with his own domestic opponents. Historically, Washington dressed up these types of ideological interventions as serving the greater good, defined in terms of US interests. But Trump has dispensed with even that pretence. For him, foreign policy is not strategic: it’s anchored by personal loyalties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brazil’s government has weatheredpunitive sanctionsagainst officials in retaliation for prosecuting the former president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who attempted a coup. The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, has beenpersonally sanctioned by Scott Bessent’s treasury department. Venezuela faces lethal US strikes on vessels off its coast. The disciplinary message to the region is clear: Washington will use its financial and military power to reward obedience and punish dissent.For Argentina, this kind of interference has a long pedigree. Braden’s crusade against Juan Perón was also driven by ideological paranoia. Yet the approach failed. Perón’s supporters rallied under the slogan “Braden o Perón”, painting the fight as a stark choice between foreign interference and national sovereignty. Perón won, and his political legacy hasdefined Argentine politicsever since. He later quipped that if Braden had not existed, “we would have had to invent him”.Perón’s voters 80 years ago weren’t just motivated by the symbolism of US interference. They voted to reject a political status quo that was deaf to their needs. Likewise, for an electorate exhausted by years of economic and social crises, Milei and Trump’s campaign succeeded by focusing voters’ energies on the failures of the old political establishment.Do populists always crash the economy?Read moreStill, Milei’s voters had numerous motivations. “A significant portion of Milei’s vote, I would say a little over half of what he obtained, is an electorate that is still hopeful and confident about the future,” says Shila Vilker, director of Argentine pollster firm Trespuntozero. Another significant chunk were concerned that US financial assistance would be conditional on the election’s results. Some were scared of the unknown, others wanted to reject Perónism.Having won the election, Milei’s challenge will now be to manage monetary policy. The government had been burning through reserves to maintain the peso’s value. US assistance was explicitly a stopgap.A temporary influx of dollars will not rescue a programme that is failing its own electorate – and in the longer term, Argentine voters are unlikely to be swayed by foreign patronage.Trump’s attempts to weaponise foreign policy in the region have often misfired. In Brazil, his assault on democratic institutions helped to bolster the popularity of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Panama, the government’s deference to American demands overChina’s access to the canalhas sparked domestic anger. For now, Milei has bucked this trend. He has secured a minority in congress that shields his austerity agenda from legislative vetoes. His symbolic victory was also enormous: he won by a single point in Buenos Aires province,a bastion of Perónism.That Milei’s libertarian experiment already needs rescuing underscores its failure. Inflation has eased, but austerity haschoked growth and gutted subsidiesfor transport, energy, health and education, making it harder for the country’s poor to make it to the end of the month. Wages are6% lessin real terms than they were just before Milei took office, and aBig Mac costs morein Argentina than in New York. Confidence in the government has plummeted, and belief in a “better future” hasfallen from 48% to 34% in 2025.Trump’s foreign policy is ideological, but it’s also markedly volatile. On Sunday he met with his ideological enemy Lula da Silva, who, despite US tariffs and sanctions, has spiritedly refused to compromise on the prosecution of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro. After months of acrimony, Lula and Trump are now reportedly working to reach a trade agreement. For all Trump’s bluster about friendship, his interventions lay bare a truth that Latin America has long understood: Washington’s priorities seldom align with the needs of those who live with their consequences.Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires; she edits the Latin America Daily BriefingDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But sometimes we all need an Eeyore aroundMon 27 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 07.02 EDTShareI’m hungry for wisdom from others on dealing with midlife challenges, such as existential reckonings, fading relevance, developing a neck like a Salvador Dalí clock and a newfound passion for A Place in the Sun (just me? I can’t get enough of retirees’ apartment-complex conundrums). Most recently, I discovered Jamie Oliver’s words on turning 50 in an interview withGood Housekeeping: “I think if you’re going to have a good go at the second half of your life, you have to edit away all the noise,” he said. “Just be with lovely people. I’m avoiding negative people – ‘mood hoovers’ – and getting better at saying no.”My first thought was: isn’t there a tension between “avoiding negative people” and “getting better at saying no”? Doesn’t that mean he has to avoidhimself? I know – it’s exactly the kind of thing a mood hoover would say, and that’s because I am one. Although in our community we actually prefer the expression “energy vampire”. Please avoid “wet blanket” or “fun sponge” too – all this comparing us to utilitarian household items is offensive; we have feelings (albeit mainly negative ones). I’ll accept “downbeat cashmere throw”, at a pinch.Perhaps you’re one too. Are you less the life and soul of the party and more its accountant or undertaker? Does your detailed response to “How are you?” have your interlocutor edging away uncomfortably? Do you greet “fun” activity suggestions with an expression that makes you look like you’ve swallowed a slug? Do you strongly identify with Eeyore; has a psychic ever told you your aura is grey?If so, you’re one of us, but it’s OK. Despite a whole self-help-inspired trend urging people to get rid of friends who “drain” them, I’d argue we offer real value. I reckon a mood hoover would have said something discouraging – or at least made a slug-swallowing face – when Jamie described his plan to write akids’ bookwith an Australian First Nation main character without consulting Indigenous communities, which could have prevented a whole lot of problems, upset and offence.

Don’t worry, the wellness industry has a very pricey solution for youViv GroskopLion’s mane mushroom, maca root, collagen concoctions: there’s a menopause gold rush out on social media’s wild frontierMon 27 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 15.53 EDTShareAwoman gets to a certain age and all she wants is to be left alone. No chance. Writing in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health, a group of academics warned recently of a “menopause gold rush” leaving women vulnerable to financial exploitation, misinformation and, frankly, a sweat-inducingly gigantic avalanche of advertising. A lot of this activity has been driven by – guess what? – social media. One respondent told the researchers: “Everything I know about the menopause I learned on Instagram from other women.” As gold rushes go, this has got to be the one you’d least like to see dramatised in a Hollywood movie: “Quick, Bianca, activate the algorithmic analysis of the campaign for the vitamin B6 supplement!”The academics warned of “a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit”. So now, instead of talking about the treatment and management of menopause, we are talking about how to cope with an equally pernicious condition and one that seems to have no cure or end: the ubiquitous commercialisation of menopause.Whereas alucky minorityof womencan sail through the naturally occurring real-life menopause without any symptoms at all, the entirely manufactured condition known as “meno marketing” is now likely to affect 100% of the adult population. This is purely my personal guesstimate. But algorithm or no, I find it hard to believe that even men have escaped the clutches of the Instagram ads for bladder pills, vitamin supplements, health-giving smoothies, calming gels, collagen concoctions and skincare solutions, all formulated with menopause in mind and often cheerfully pushed by celebrities with followings of all ages and genders. “Christmas is coming – why not treat your mum?”I don’t want to spoil anyone’s retail therapy. And if maca root, ashwagandha orlion’s mane mushroom(all offered with menopause in mind) are your poison and you want to consume them with your eyes wide open, then be my guest. But do we really have to have so many things with exotic names marketed to us endlessly as the easy-to-swallow solution to a highly complex andunder-researched issue?There would surely be an outcry if anyone prescribed lipstick as an essential menopause aid. (For topical application. Although, frankly, there are days when I would eat anything.) But it struck me recently that the mood-enhancing effect of lipstick might be as significant as any medical placebo. And it’s certainly a cheaper and more reliable pick-me-up than many of the menopause aids on the market. Indeed, I became so convinced of this genius money-spinner that I looked it up to see if anyone else had already thought of it. And, lo and behold, there are already several brands of lip balm marketed under the banner of “menopause management”.The biggest problem with menopause is that there are about13 million womenin the UK experiencing it at any one time. And the slowly dawning realisation that these women might be slightly underserved after centuries of demonising female ageing has unfortunately coincided with the high-water mark of aggressive capitalism. The impulse to rinse the market has eclipsed the need for public education.I wouldn’t mind if it weren’t so nakedly foolish. After all, as far as market segmentation goes, this seems like the least niche market ever. How can 13 million human beings all benefit from the same specialist products in the same way at the same time? The truth is, you can’t. But the algorithm doesn’t care about that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In menopause, you can have a nonexistent experience (some women don’t notice it happening and have no symptoms). Or you can feel so bad that you start to think life is not worth living:one in 10women in this cohort have suicidal thoughts. Or you can be in between those two extremes, with any combination of the 100-plus documented menopausal symptoms. No two women’s experiences of the “same” life event are necessarily remotely alike. In short, this demographic is so vague and meaningless as to be a marketer’s dream.I suspect this would all be less annoying if there were – as the academics recommended – a proper information campaign about symptoms, treatment and expectations. As things stand, my guess is that most of us know far more about the contraceptive pill than we do about hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It’s pretty obvious who stands to benefit from that state of affairs and it’s certainly not menopausal women.We need a happy medium in the world of menopause, where it is a phenomenon that is neither constantly being marketed at us nor swept shamefully under the carpet. We have gone from a time when the word was barely spoken aloud to an era when it’s hard to find a podcast that is not discussing testosterone gel. The sad thing is, I’m not sure we are any better informed about menopause, HRT, hormones or women’s cycles than we were 20 years ago. Buying the social-media-marketed equivalent of a shovel – the biggest money-spinner in the original gold rush – is not going to make anything better.Viv Groskop is a comedian and author of How to Own the Room:Womenand the Art of Brilliant SpeakingExplore more on these topicsMenopauseOpinionWomenWomen's healthSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

That will endanger us allDanny Stone is chief executive of the Antisemitism Policy TrustMon 27 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 07.04 EDTShareThe Metropolitan police has beenlauded in some quartersfor deciding that it will no longer investigate so-called non-crime hate incidents, in order to allow officers to “focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations”. Against the context of headlines describing the Met as the “thought police”, something was bound to give. “Goodbye and good riddance to ‘non-crime’” wasone joyful take in the Spectator.But make no mistake: this is a shortsighted, premature announcement. It threatens the victim-led approach to policing thatresulted from the Macpherson inquiry, which followed the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and egregious police failures. It’s bad for society, for vulnerable people in society and for policing.The bar for illegal hate is high in the UK, and rightly so. Not every incident reported to the police is a crime, but it is right that people feel safe – especially when at their most vulnerable – and are encouraged to report what has happened. It is sensible that harm can be identified and extremism prevented. Too often in the debate about these non-crime incidents – bogged down in the trenches of the culture wars – the view of those they are there meant to protect is absent.There are three principal ways in which police response to non-crime hate incidents benefits both the police and society. First, they can help protect vulnerable individuals. One tragic example is inthe case of Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her severely disabled daughter Francesca Hardwick following a decade of torment by local youths. Though there were 33 incidents reported to the police, they targeted different members of Pilkington’s family at different locations, and the dots were not connected. Many of those incidents should have been recorded as non-crime hate incidents. The Independent Police Complaints Commission’sreport foundthat the failure to consider the overall harm to the family prevented the interventions that could have protected them and prevented the tragedy.The second benefit is that cumulative behaviours can be better understood and addressed. The case of two men prosecuted in 2009 under the Public Order Act for inciting racial hatred was not only important for establishing precedents about UK jurisdiction relating to online hate, but provides a good example of how a picture of racial incitement can be proved from individual posts that might not constitute illegal activity when considered in isolation.The third benefit is that non-crime hate incidents form the backbone of intelligence that can assist in diagnosing harm, and failing integration. The Commission for Racial Equality once had local race equality councils and other bodies that could feed evidence of local tensions, particularly around elections, into a central knowledge bank. That function no longer exists. Non-crime hate incidents can help police to better understand and ultimately provide interventions to prevent scenes like those we have seen around migrant hotels.Many arguments have been marshalled against non-crime hate incidents but they do not stand up to scrutiny. Fears are raised about data retention and disclosure, despite no known example being cited of the release of such information as part of any formal disclosure process. Critics say these incident types lead to a “chilling effect” on free expression, but the same critics express themselves freely – in parliament, in the media and elsewhere.They cite the cases relating to police contact withAllison Pearson of the Daily Telegraphorthe writer Graham Linehan, but in both instances, these were cases of alleged crimes, not non-crimes, and even then both investigations were dropped by police.The police statement about its intention to drop non-crime hate incidents makes little sense. While these incidents won’t be investigated, they will – according to the force – still be recorded. However, in reality, they weren’t investigated anyway – there is no power of arrest in relation to a non-crime hate incident.The fact is that if non-crime hate incidents are abolished, something will be required in their place. If the Crown Prosecution Service judges something not to be illegal, do we ignore it? Surely most people would wish to see the incidences of men dancing in celebration of the heinous 7 October attacks at least forming part of the intelligence picture. I fear without this approach, we will be gazing into a future of multiple public inquiries, exploring why action was not taken to prevent serious harm.This is not to say that the reporting or handling of non-crime hate incidents doesn’t require reform, and that is whya review is taking place.To judge the outcome of that review before the investigation has concluded is premature, and the police pronouncement about its intention to stop investigating these incidents risks skewing the balance between genuine concerns relating to what form they take and the protection extended to the people who will pay the price of abolishing them. Look beyond the headlines, and think about them.Danny Stone is chief executive of the Antisemitism Policy TrustDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This will be the ninth election for theTweede Kamer(second chamber), the Dutch parliament’s legislative chamber, in this still young century. In some ways the Netherlands has become the Italy of the 21st century, plagued by political fragmentation, governmental instability, and radicalisation (accompanied, increasingly often,by violence).This election is a direct result of this fragmentation and instability. The far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by Geert Wilders dominated the last ruling coalition, but stillpulled the plugin July, after less than a year. The various lessons that the Dutch media, political parties, and voters have drawn from this tumultuous experience should be relevant beyond the Netherlands, given that most European countries are struggling with a similar challenge: how to deal with the increasing electoral, ideological and political success of the far right.Like everyone else, the Dutch media was taken by surprise that Wilders let “his government” fall and have tried to make sense of it. Compared to 2002, when an even more chaoticcoalitionfell after just 12 weeks, there is a lot less debate about whether the far right should have a role in Dutch politics – almost as if it has become impossible to imagine a Dutch future without it.This is not surprising, as most Dutch media remain a (largely voluntary) hostage of the far right. The man himself barely graces the media with appearances or interviews, yet Wilders has beenthe most discussed politicianon Dutch television. And in his physical absence, the media have given Joost Eerdmans, leader of the radical right JA21 party, disproportionate prominence, while a tacticalleadership changein the extreme-right Forum for Democracy (FVD), where Lidewij de Vos has succeeded Thierry Baudet, did exactly what it was intended to do, by returning the party to the spotlight.Dutch political parties have mostly helped to normalise and rationalise the far right. Some rightwing parties haveruled outfuture coalition agreements with Wilders and the PVV: not because of Wilders’ anti-constitutional ideology but for his “immature” and “irresponsible”behaviour. In fact, rightwing parties continued to pass far-right policies in parliament after Wilders left the coalition. These included the “strictest asylum policy ever”, a (stricter)burqa banand even an “antifa ban” – strikingly, the latter a proposal of the FVD, the only far-right party that is supposed to be excluded from power by acordon sanitaire(fire wall), at least nationally.Even “centrist” politicians continue to normalise the far right. Rob Jetten has moved his socially liberal D66 party to the right on issues such as culture and immigration, embracing a kind of communitarian patriotism, and does not rule out governing with the radical right JA21 or the radicalised farmers’ party, BBB. Frans Timmermans, leader of the centre-left GreenLeft/Labour(GL/PvdA), has sharpened the party’simmigration policies, spoken of a “refugee problem”, and appeared on the far right’s favourite TV programme, Vandaag Inside – ironically, to the chagrin of many of the programme’sloyal viewers.But as always, voters still seem to prefer the original to the growing number of far-right copycats. Although Wilders’ PVV has lost some support,roughly 4% downon the last election result, it is clearly the most popular party in the country.Most volatility comes from the implosion of two of the newer parties,the BBBandPieter Omtzigt’s New Social Contract (NSC), which were in the outgoing coalition but now poll at 2.5% and 0%, respectively. Their voters seem to have gone (or returned) mostly to the Christian Democrats (CDA), which is slated to be the big winner. The conservative VVD, the former party of ex-prime minister Mark Rutte which has dominated Dutch politics this century, is expected to lose about a third of its already diminished 2023 electorate, mostly to the radical-right JA21.The left, unable to break the far right’s stranglehold onthe media (particularly the chatshows), remains rather marginal and stagnant – despite the recent merger of the Greens and Labour into GL/PvdA.Interestingly, polls show that the main movement is within the three electoral blocs, ie the far right, the centre-right, and the left. Each bloc maintains largely the samesupport– 35%, 40%, and 25% respectively – but within the far-right bloc, JA21 becomes the second biggest (after PVV), while in the centre-right bloc CDA, and possibly D66, overtake the VVD.Of course, opinion polls can be wrong, and increasingly in the Netherlands they are wrong, as more and more people wait until election day to make up their minds. Still, there is no doubt that the coalition formation process will be hard and long, even by Dutch standards.Almost all parties have excluded Wilders, but some (such as the VVD) have also ruled out doing deals with the centre-left. So, even if the GL/PvdA became the biggest “democratic” party, Timmermans would still need a change of heart from the VVD to become prime minister at the head of a broad centre-right coalition. Alternatively, the Christian Democrat leader Henri Bontebal could lead a centre-right government which involved less personal friction but would still be vulnerable to instability.Whatever the eventual outcome, one thing is already clear: despite the far right’s evident failure in governing theNetherlands, it retains a magnetic hold over the country. Party politics remains fragmented yet dominated by the mainstreaming and normalisation of far-right frames and politicians. Liberal democratic parties devote more energy to fighting each other than the far right. As far as acordon sanitaireholds, it does not extend to all far-right parties (like JA21) and rejects its behaviour rather than its ideology. These are trends that we see both in the European parliament and in many other European countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now as then, Mr Streetingsuggested, a historic rout in a heartland seat should compel Labour to change the “pace and scale” of its ambition.It is a superficially plausible analogy, but one to treat with care. Four years ago, Hartlepool confirmed the view of influential figures around Sir Keir that if Labour was to succeed it would be through ruthlessly expunging the leftish influence of most of its members, in favour of a top‑down, centralised approach. The politics that subsequentlyemergedwas technocratic, cautious to a fault and contemptuous of those who dared to remain within a supposed “ideological comfort zone”.What Labour strategically requires now is something close to the opposite. Lucy Powell’selectionas Labour’s new deputy leader – on a low turnout that testified to deep internal disenchantment – was a bottom-up rebuke to that effect. Ms Powell was the only cabinet ministersackedin the reshuffle prompted by the resignation of her predecessor, Angela Rayner. That has liberated her to articulate theviewthat a “course correction” is required: one that dials down the “command and control” style behaviour at the top, and starts to treat traditional Labour instincts and convictions on issues such as inequality and poverty as electoral assets rather than liabilities.Although she will have no direct policy portfolio, Ms Powell expects to attend cabinet meetings. If Sir Keir is wise, he will welcome her reappearance as an opportunity to reset relations with the wider party, rather than as a threat. As a former deputy chief of staff to Ed Miliband, Ms Powell has affiliations with the soft left, but can hardly be considered an inveterate rebel. Had herwarningsover the government’s doomed proposals to cut disability benefits been heeded, the prime minister may have avoided at least one of the humbling episodes that have punctuated his first 16 months in office.Unlike Ms Rayner, Ms Powell will not enjoy the status that comes with combining the role of deputy leader with that of deputy prime minister. She will also have to tread a fine line. Ahead of what will be a tumultuous set of local elections in May, playing the role of a critical friend could deliver unintended gifts to political opponents. But her lobbying for a bolder assertion ofLabourvalues and priorities – challenging Reform UK rather than allowing it to set the terms of debate in areas such as immigration – should be listened to by a government in dire need of reconnecting with the wider public.The seeds of Labour’s precipitate decline in the polls were sown in the aftermath of last year’s election, when the winter fuel allowance wasremovedfrom about 10 million pensioners. That was a catastrophic misjudgment regarding what the public wanted – and expected – from a Labour administration. Plaid Cymru’s spectacularwinin Caerphilly demonstrated that a generous politics of the common good can see off Nigel Farage, if prosecuted with vigour and confidence. Labour’s route to recovery lies in rediscovering its social democratic soul, and uniting other progressive forces around it. That Ms Powell now has her seat back at the cabinet table, and can make that case at the top of Labour, is welcome news.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is the leading infectious killer of the continent, responsible fornearly600,000 deaths a year. Cases are rising and there is an urgent need for more funding, yet western donor countries are instead cutting back on aid. We still hear brave talk about eliminating malaria. But an expertreportnow warns of a potential resurgence that could add almost a million more deaths to the annual toll by the end of the decade.Most of the money to fight the mosquito-borne disease – 59% – comes through the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Its executive director, Peter Sands,saidlast week at the World Health Summit in Berlin that of the three killers, the one that kept him awake at night was malaria.This could be the canary in the coalmine. Malaria kills far more quickly than HIV or tuberculosis. The impact of funding cuts and aid diversions and thescrappingof USAID by Donald Trump, which housed so much global health expertise, will be seen in the malaria figures faster than in most other diseases. But mankind’s despoliation of the environment is also in play.The climate crisis is altering rainfall patterns and enabling the spread of mosquitoes. The parasites they carry have developed someresistancein east Africa to the artemisinins, the best drugs we have against the disease. It happened with chloroquine and with every other malaria drug, and undermines the effectiveness of artemisinin-impregnated bed nets as well. There was a window of real opportunity while the drugs had full power, but it’s closing. The other hope is vaccines, and some have been developed and rolled out, but although they offer about 50% protection against death from malaria in the first year – for a child fortunate enough to get vaccinated – they do not stop transmission.Cases surged in 2023, the latest for which we have figures, reaching 263m, which was 11m higher than in the previous year. The report, from a group of agencies including Malaria No More UK and the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, supports the call of the Global Fund for more money. Data analysis shows the damage that will be done if malaria control slips – and the hugely positive impact on African lives and economies if pressure on the parasite can be maintained. Reaching a2030 annual funding targetwould save 1.86 million lives and boost African GDP by $231bn, as healthy children stay in school and become economically productive rather than a cost to society. But a 20% cut would lead to 82,000 more deaths and a drop in GDP of $5.14bn. A severe cut in funding would mean 990,000 more deaths as malaria prevention collapses, and a GDP drop of $83 billion.Worryingly, the second scenario is already on the cards: Germany has promised €1bn to the Global Fund, which is a 23% cut on previous contributions.Malariais a really hard disease to beat, but it can be done and it would surely be unthinkable to let the killing climb again. The UK, rumoured to be considering a 20% cut, and other countries, must find the funds however tight their budgets, to save voiceless children’s lives.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This is not because they were “looney lefties”, but because they were likely seeking something to deal with the “British crisis” that you identify in your editorial (The Guardian view on the Caerphilly byelection: Labour’s collapse in its Welsh heartland signals a wider loss, 24 October). The populism of Corbynism was not the answer to the country’s malaise, but rather a symptom of it. Nigel Farage realised this, and until those controlling the direction of Labour do likewise, its decline will continue.Colin BurkeCartmel, CumbriaYou appear to have assumed that because Reform didn’t win in Caerphilly that immigration must not have been an important issue. In fact, there are many voters for whom immigration is important but who reject the xenophobia ofReform UK, the Tories and Labour. This would seem to be just as plausible an explanation for both Reform’s failure to win and the collapse in support for Labour.Daniel OwenTorrington, DevonThe prime minister’s advisers will doubtless react to the Caerphilly result with more of the same Reform-lite policies that have caused support for the government to crash. A reset is needed, including no more back-room deals with property developers and lobbyists, respect for environmental concerns, democratic oversight of infrastructure development, restoration of our protest rights and a halt to City deregulation. Above all,Labourshould put the country above petty party tribalism and work with others to agree a liberal consensus against the dangers of the far right and big tech.Paul KeelingWelling, KentGiven the Reform UK leader’s habit of disappearing from view whenever an election result doesn’t go his party’s way (Reform swaggered into Caerphilly, ready for a coronation.

Sadly, Labour’s white paper on post-16 education and skills does nothing of the kind.Its focus is entirely on skills for employment. Post-16 education must be “employer focused”, yet this – the mantra of decades past – has been a highway to failure. The proportion ofadults in further educationis now at its lowest since the 1940s. The decline began in the 1990s, when meeting the needs of employers – rather than on all-round provision for life – became the obsession. After theTreasury’s 2006 Leitch reviewcalled for further “strengthening employer voice” in the system, participation went into freefall.The white paper says nothing about education for democracy; community, equality and social inclusion receive hardly a mention. Only universities (not further education) are encouraged to develop “civic plans”.One might have thought that “post-16 education” meant education for adults. But this mixed bag is no radical approach. It is the failed recipe of decades past, with the odd new herb. It has no “broad and generous, humane and liberal spirit”. Tawney and otherLaboureducationists and politicians of the past must be turning in their graves.John HolfordEmeritus Robert Peers professor of adult education, University of NottinghamIt was heartening to read your leader on further education colleges. It is a drumbeat that’s rarely given due prominence in the press. When colleges were taken away from local education authority (LEA) control in 1993, they gained much desired freedom but paid heavily by losing any political voice. MPs gave their attention to universities and local authorities listened to school parents.As an LEA education officer who transferred to be a college manager, I saw how important that political power was to halt the year-on-year cuts to college budgets. We should despair but not be surprised at the burgeoning group of 16- to 24-year-olds not in education, employment or training (Neet), or the lack of opportunities for adults.A light-touch piece of research I did 20 years ago demonstrated clearly that for every £1 spent to help a Neet individual, about £1,000 would be saved by the taxpayer in future costs. Every further education college lecturer can provide a host of examples of Neet individuals successfully integrated into education and work. Please keep beating the drum for them.Iain StrathGreat Gransden, CambridgeshireIt is no surprise that in my 30-plus years of involvement with changing vocational courses, GCSEs and A-levels have never been renamed. I was truly a man of letters (YTS: youth training scheme; CPVE: certificate of pre-vocational education; GNVQ: general national vocational qualification; and T-levels) – all of which have struggled for acceptance. The erosion of further education colleges reflects the entrenched academic superiority that deprives us of the tradespeople and care workers we so badly need. Post-16 options have to include fully funded and respected vocational alternatives for the long term, not the political short term.Rob EllettPuddletown, DorsetHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

They are essential to building a Britain that is both prosperous and sustainable. The environment is not a barrier to growth – and certainly not an internet meme – but the bedrock of our economy, our health and our national wellbeing.This crude and dishonest campaign against environmental protections won’t build a single new home. It will only erode public trust, needlessly inflame culture wars and further degrade the natural world that we all depend on.This government should stop pitting people against nature and start working with those striving to ensure that new developments benefit both.Sally HaynsCEO, Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental ManagementExplore more on these topicsEnvironmentThe TraitorsHousingCommunitiesXTelevisionClimate crisislettersShareReuse this content"

But given that they have spent almost 800 days top of the table since last being champions in 2004, nothing will be taken for granted at this stage. After an outlay of more than £250m in the summer, Mikel Arteta has a formidable squad that has been able to cope with injuries to important players such as Kai Havertz and Martin Ødegaard – a problem that derailed them in three successive runner-up finishes.There is also a new steely determination epitomised by their meagre defence, which has conceded three goals in 13 games in all competitions and only one from open play. A group that has learned and grown from its experiences is highly motivated to go one better, starting with their manager. The question is whether Liverpool orManchester Citycan recover to sustain a challenge that could make Arsenal nervous, especially if Viktor Gyökeres continues to struggle for goals. They have managed only five from open play and are heavily reliant on set pieces, although stopping Gabriel Magalhães and co is easier said than done.Ed AaronsThe team’s spine is strongIt’s probably too soon to anoint Arsenal as champions but their form makes ominous reading for the rest of the crowd, especially their defensive record. Gyökeres, Eberechi Eze and Martín Zubimendi have strengthened Mikel Arteta’s side but solid foundations are the significant pieces of the puzzle. For a while now William Saliba and Gabriel have ensured the soft centre is no more. Arteta’s old boss, Pep Guardiola, is surely his biggest rival for the title from here, with City capable of going on a similar run. Erling Haaland’s prolific form – he is the Premier League’s leading scorer with 11 and has outscored eight teams – means City simply cannot be discounted. Afterdefeat at Aston Villaon Sunday, Guardiola insisted he was far from reaching for the panic button when asked about the gap to the summit, clearly enthused by elements of his side’s display. On another day City could have won and only three points would separate the sides.Ben FisherSquad depth will be testedOf course the race is not over. Aside from the obvious – the clocks have just gone back and all the teams have 87 points left to play for – reservations over Arsenal’s ability to go the distance are well founded. In their favour, the league leaders are more experienced and resolute this season with greater strength in depth than their rivals. But Arteta’s side have a reputation as nearly men for a reason, their injury record is poor and whether they can handle the pressure of leading from the front is unknown. There is also a sense that Arsenal have edged clear thanks to the inconsistency of the competition rather than outstanding form.Inconsistency leads us on to City and Liverpool, teams in transition (necessary or otherwise) and stuttering as a consequence, but whose talent is unquestionable. Guardiola’s and Arne Slot’s ability to deliver aPremier Leaguetitle is proven. City are re-emerging but are only a Haaland injury away from trouble. Liverpool’s title defence is worse than their last one after nine games (20 points in 2020-21 compared with 15 now) but, daft as it sounds, they are capable of turning things around providing Slot discovers his best XI and big‑money signings finally make an impact. But maybe Bournemouth under the brilliant Andoni Iraola will continue to disrupt the usual suspects?Andy HunterBelief will be vitalArsenal’s defence is the Ebenezer Scrooge of the Premier League and the telling bellwether of why Arteta’s team may well be crowned champions. Liverpool’sfourth consecutive league defeaton Saturday, at Brentford, leaves them seven points behind the Gunners and in a freefall a seemingly flailing Slot is struggling to arrest. Of the other traditional contenders City also lost at the weekend as Guardiola continues to rue the anterior cruciate ligament injury Rodri sustained last September. Rodri was missing at Villa with a hurt hamstring, the latest problem hampering his attempt to regain consistent fitness, and it was notable that Guardiola eschewed the supposed deputy, Nico González, for Tijjani Reijnders in the XI, then replaced the latter for the former on 66 minutes: a sure sign the manager remains unsure who best fills the Rodri role when the Spanish midfielder is absent.Chelsea, the last team before City or Liverpool to win the league (in 2016-17), also went down – last gaspat home against Sunderland– and their eight-point deficit to Arsenal can be cast as a chasm. Of the rest, Manchester United, Sunderland, Tottenham and Bournemouth are unlikely candidates for obvious reasons. With Areta’s side also being the division’s joint second highest scorers with 16, their only glass half empty scenario is the question of mental courage. In the three second-place finishes of the past three seasons can be found a question of hard nosed belief. The glaring example came in 2022-23 when, on 1 April, they held an eight-point advantage over City (who had a game in hand) before capitulating, taking only three points from the next available 12 and ending five points behind Guardiola’s champions.

Not quite yet. The margin for error for the chasing pack is almost gone but Arsenal have some awkward games before Christmas. Come through those unscathed and they will appear unstoppable. A slip or two will give others hope. But Arsenal look so strong. A defence to rival Chelsea’s 2004-05 vintage ensures calm. Arsenal have faced one shot on target in their past three games: absurd. Equally, they are 17th for goals from open play. Ugly wins could easily turn into frustrating draws.Others lack that durability. Chelsea are too up and down. Tottenham are poor at home and lack individual quality. Liverpool are in a top-four fight now. City have Haaland but are in transition. It’s not being patronising to say that Bournemouth simply have a great chance of Champions League qualification. It leaves us in the strange position of wondering whetherManchester Unitedare quietly dangerous. Their underlying numbers are good and they should benefit from no European football. United, though? Are we really relying on United? It’s basically there for Arsenal. They may get nervous but only if there is pressure on their lead. Still, let’s see where they are after they go to Villa Park on 6 December.Jacob SteinbergThe season has barely begunThe clocks have just gone back, we’re not quite out of October and there are still an awful lot of hard yards to be covered. Arsenal have started impressively but they don’t look invincible. Tottenham, City and Liverpool are only five, six and seven points back respectively. At this stage of a campaign those sorts of gaps can easily be closed. And let’s not forgetBournemouth. Only four points off the top, lacking European distractions and in possession of an outstanding manager, they have surely earned the right to dream.Arteta will know better than to indulge in any title fantasies as he approaches a potentially season defining November fixture list featuring league trips to Burnley,Sunderland– who have only five fewer points – and Chelsea plus a home derby with Tottenham. Given that, in between, there are Champions League dates with Slavia Prague and Bayern Munich, the road ahead looks hazardous. Moreover, every team ebb and flow to some extent over 38 league games. Some specifically tailor pre-season training to try to ensure strong run-ins and accept slightly slow starts as an inevitable side effect. At some point Alexander Isak will surely start scoring again; Liverpool’s title defence is not quite over. Do not write City off either.Louise TaylorRivals lack consistencyNo title race is ever done before the quarter-way point, but Arsenal are in an extremely strong position. Finishing second three times in succession has, perhaps unfairly, created a now-or-never dynamic, and for now they seem to be responding to that with efficiency and ruthlessness. Their defensive solidity means that, even if they don’t play well, they only have to score once to win and their exceptional ability from dead balls makes that more likely than not. Vitally, they can win games in two different ways. Their squad looks the most coherent in the division, with multiple players in most positions; they’ve opened up a four-point gap despite being without Ødegaard, Havertz and Noni Madueke.But it’s not just that Arsenal look very good; it’s that it’s very hard to see who could put together a consistent enough run to overhaul them.Liverpool, as Slot keeps admitting, have been worked out; City are also trying to accommodate a number of new players and seem overreliant on Haaland; and Chelsea are blunt without Cole Palmer and look short at the back. Under pressure, there’s a chance any leader can crumble; but nobody looks capable of applying that pressure.Jonathan WilsonExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalManchester CityLiverpoolManchester UnitedTottenham HotspurChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

This year, with four meetings remaining, the title run-in reaches its decisive phase with a three-way fight between the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and the Red Bull ofMax Verstappen. Divining the outcome is a decidedly tricky affair.As recently asthe Dutch GP in Augustit appeared a two-way battle between the McLaren drivers would decide it. However, with Red Bull managing to apply upgrades that have unlocked the performance of the RB21, the equation is far more complex. Their car can now be as good, if not better, than the McLaren but the margins are small and neither team can be entirely sure who will have the edge on a given weekend.It makes for a fascinating finale, one made all the more intriguing by the human factor. Norris leads the championship by one point from Piastri, with Verstappen 36 points off the lead. Were the three protagonists on similar points it would be all but impossible not to back Verstappen’s experience and ruthless execution to see him through. As it is he still needs a little fortune in the form of DNFs or both McLarens having a terrible weekend.In the absence of this, it is Norris who carries the experience over his teammate and has been on much better form in recent races, which has perhaps given him just enough momentum to edge him over the line.São Paulo Grand PrixInterlagos, 9 NovemberLast year’s winnerMax VerstappenThe majestic, sweeping circuit in São Paulo should favour the McLaren. A mix of opening and closing fast sectors with a tight midsection, the high altitude allows teams to run a higher downforce setup. McLaren have enjoyed a strong aero-efficiency and should excel in the medium to high-speed corners on the quick sections of the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, if it is dry.However, last year in the wet Verstappen gave another masterclasscoming from 17th to win the race, in one of his greatest performances. It all but sealed his fourth title which he delivered at the next round in Las Vegas. The Red Bull is more competitive now than it was at this point last year and rain is expected over the weekend in São Paulo. With a sprint race thrown in, Brazil could once more be pivotal in turning the title race. In the wet it will be advantage Verstappen while the two McLaren drivers must ensure they make no mistakes.Predicted winnerVerstappenLas Vegas Grand PrixLas Vegas Strip Circuit, 23 NovemberLast year’s winnerGeorge RussellThe preponderance of straights on the street circuit of Vegas make for a low-downforce track and that combined with slow corners and cold temperatures all mitigate against McLaren who have had a poor record here since the race was first held in 2023. Neither driver has qualified or finished higher than sixth.The track layout does not play to the strengths of the MCL39 and similarly the cool temperatures mitigate its tyre management advantage. Mercedes and Ferrari in contrast have found Vegas suited to their cars and they will expect to be fighting at the front once more. However, since Red Bull’s aero overhaul they have been enormously strong on the low-downforce tracks and with their ability to now run at a lower ride height too, of the title contenders Verstappen will expect to win big on the Strip.Predicted winnerVerstappenQatar Grand PrixLusail International Circuit, 30 NovemberLast year’s winnerVerstappenA meeting with the final sprint race of the season so another opportunity for a potential swing, McLaren would consider this very much in their wheelhouse. A fast track dominated by flowing high-speed long corners, requiring a reasonably high downforce.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen celebrates with his Red Bull team after winning in Qatar last year.Photograph: Peter Fox/Getty ImagesYet last year having taken a one-two in the sprint, both McLarens failed to deliver in the race. They qualified poorly and Norris was given a penalty for failing to slow under yellows in the race, taking him out of contention. Red Bull in contrast hooked up their car pretty much perfectly and Verstappen delivered. This season they would expect to at least be nipping at the heels of McLaren if not better but Norris and Piastri will expect to emerge on top in Qatar.Predicted winnerPiastriAbu Dhabi Grand PrixYas Marina Circuit, 7 DecemberLast year’s winnerLando NorrisA circuit that must be considered all but perfect for the McLaren, which may be crucial if, as expected, this fight goes to the wire. Straights and fast corners favour their aero efficiency as does the smooth surface and the absence of some of the slower, tight turns removed with the reconfiguration of 2021.Norris won from pole last year to seal the constructors’ championship for McLaren, but again the team are unlikely to enjoy such an advantage over Red Bull this time and Verstappen has won four of the last five races in Abu Dhabi. If it is the title decider and if it is close, it may be a matter of who can hold their nerve when it counts to close it out.Predicted winnerNorrisPredicted 2025 drivers’ championNorrisExplore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OneanalysisShareReuse this content"

In each case there were incidents that can serve as good educational pieces for understanding the calls that match officials make.Starting at Old Trafford, the yellow card for Patrick Dorgu after fouling Yankuba Minteh, when the Brighton man looked as if he was through on goal, frustrated a lot of people. Everybody screams: “Last man, you’ve got to go” – which is absolutely false. Just because you’re the last defender it doesn’t mean you have to be sent off. In this kind of incident, the referee awards a foul and then has to consider the criteria of what fits the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreThere are four factors, and they are really important: the distance from goal, whether the attacking player is in possession of the ball, their direction of travel and the number of covering defenders. The key detail here is that the likelihood of Minteh getting possession is very slim. The ball is rolling through to the goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, who would be able to pick it up. With that in mind, the on-field decision of yellow card is confirmed because the attacker has knocked the ball too far. The phraseology “last man” doesn’t come into play.An earlier incident involved Luke Shaw and Georginio Rutter in the buildup to United’s third goal, where Shaw appears to cause Rutter to lose control of possession by grabbing his shirt. There’s no question Shaw does have a little hold as the Brighton forward runs past him in the centre circle, but I think the important word here is “little”. It’s fleeting, it’s not sustained holding, and the way Rutter goes to ground does not fit with the contact made. He goes to ground theatrically to show the referee that he has been fouled but Anthony Taylor allows play to continue.Taylor had a really good view of this and the guidance this season has been to not penalise for minimal contact, only sustained holding so, in my opinion, this was the right decision. Bryan Mbeumo goes on to score at the end of the move, so the incident was looked at by the video assistant referee as part of the attacking phase of play (APP) in the buildup. What we’ve seen in the Premier League is that the window for looking at the APP is narrower now and we don’t want to be going back and re-refereeing, so this was a good quick check by the VAR, Michael Oliver, and the goal was allowed to stand.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk makes contact with Dango Ouattara on the edge of the penalty area.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesAtBrentford, there was plenty of discussion around penalty decisions. The first came early when Cody Gakpo went to ground in the Brentford penalty area. But James Collins, the Brentford defender, doesn’t challenge, he just plants his foot. Gakpo goes to ground very easily, he throws his arms in the air, his body language is suggesting he’s been fouled. It’s definitely not a penalty but the question is: did he try to deceive the referee? Should he have received a yellow card for simulation?There is an argument for that because of the theatrical action of Gakpo, though some people will say: no caution, play on. These are the fine margins in relation to simulation when there is minimal contact because you’ve got to start thinking about several things at once: is he avoiding contact? Is he initiating contact? Is it instigating contact? All of this happens in a split second. In this instance, there’s maybe slight contact but it’s so theatrical I think if a yellow card was awarded for simulation, you couldn’t have too many complaints.Also in this game, we have another incident that serves as a good educational piece, this one relating to the process of VAR and penalties. At half-time we have a change of referee where Tim Robinson, who was the fourth official, replaces Simon Hooper. Robinson comes on to the field and 15 minutes later sees Virgil van Dijk kick the bottom of Dango Ouattara’s foot. He blows the whistle and awards a free-kick to Brentford.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Quite clearly Van Dijk does catch Ouattara, so it was a foul and that is check complete. The second part is whether the contact is inside or outside the penalty area. Here, the key thing is that the line on the edge of the penalty area belongs to the goalkeeper. He could claim a cross on the line and it would not be handball; it’s part of the area. That’s relevant here because the contact is on the line and the check here is not a subjective call, it’s factual: is it inside or is it outside?That’s why Robinson doesn’t go to the monitor: you don’t need to when it’s a factual decision. What he does do is give the crowd a description of the incident, explaining that the offence occurred inside the penalty area and not outside, therefore resulting in a penalty kick.Chris Foy is a former Premier League refereeExplore more on these topicsRefereesLaws of footballManchester UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionBrentfordLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

Sale, in contrast to the in-form Saints, are seventh in the Prem with two wins from five matches.Borthwick has a wealth of options in the back-line and the Northampton wing Tommy Freeman is being strongly considered to start at outside-centre. Mitchell backed his clubmate,who scored four tries against Saracenslast Friday, to thrive if he switches from the wing to No 13.“I think it will be good. He’s a quality player who has a lot of facets to his game with his power and how he works in the air,” Mitchell said. “His confidence is through the roof and his form is amazing. We knew when he came through the academy that he’s got everything: speed, power, height. He understands the game. We know if he puts that all together he’s one hell of a player.”The hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie has welcomed the “Test-match animal” Tom Curry, his Sale teammate, back into the England fold. Curry has recovered from having surgery on a wrist problem after the Lions tour and is in contention to start in the back row against the Wallabies.“He’s built differently,” said Cowan-Dickie, who will reach 50 England caps if he plays at Twickenham. “I think he showed that in the Lions. It’s a cliche: ‘He’s a Test-match animal,’ – but he is. For his game and mental approach, he could have not played for a year, and I’d still put him in my team.”Curry appeared six times for the British & Irish Lions in Australia but has missed the start of Sale’s domestic campaign due to the surgery. “He’s a workhorse,” Cowan-Dickie said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s one of these best back-rowers, if not the best back-rower in the world so I’m buzzing that he’s on my team.”Cowan-Dickie has also endured serious injuries himself since his England debut in 2015. “I’ve stuck around – they don’t call me the cockroach for no reason,” Cowan-Dickie joked. “I’ve had a lot of injuries. Would I be here today if I didn’t play through them? Maybe not. I think it’s made me robust.”Cowan-Dickie also said he is continuing to the feel benefits of giving up alcohol. “Loving it – I’ve not thought about once,” he said. “I don’t know how long it has been: 17 or 18 months, and I feel way better for it.

Emotion clogged his throat after he had belonged to three Ashes-winning England squads, while never feeling he fulfilled his immense wicket-taking talent, and having ended up lost and broken on the 2013-14 tour of Australia.Finn tried again but stifled crying choked his reading. He looked up and nodded at the encouraging producer. His mouth almost crumpled but, this time, he got through it.“I learned that the stuff in the book is still raw and emotional, more so than I realised,” the amiable and intelligent former fast bowler says now. He maintains eye contact throughout our interview, his honesty matching the book’s unflinching tone.Crunch time nears for Australia as selectors try to fit Ashes batting puzzle pieces together | Martin PeganRead more“When you’re talking to a therapist, you learn how to not let it extrapolate to a point where it’s really bad. But writing the book, and reading it, evoked emotions that still hurt me.”Finnhad a fine career, playing 126 times for England across three formats and taking 254 wickets. In his 36 Tests he took 125 wickets. When he retired two years ago, Mike Atherton’s tribute included this telling line: “For all the ups and downs, only 24 fast or fast-medium bowlers have taken more Test wickets for England.”But Finn is candid. “A lot of those emotions are still there: embarrassment, shame, letting people down. They remain because I could and should have done a lot more.”The 36-year-old listens intently when I suggest that pride should be his dominant emotion. He nods. “I’m very proud I came back the way that I did. I’m really proud of the resilience. I’m actually a more rounded and better person but reading those last pages meant deep-down emotions came to the surface.”View image in fullscreenSteven Finn: ‘I was so mean and harsh on myself because I had that desperation to make the most of my height, bounce and pace.’Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianFinn took 14 wickets in the first three Tests of England’s crushing victory in Australia in 2010-11. But problems with his run-up and shattered psyche meant he did not play at all in the 2013-14 Ashes. England lost 5-0 andhe was sent home, in misery, during the white‑ball internationals. Ashley Giles, England’s coach in the shorter formats, said he was“not selectable”.Finn’s book includes extracts from the diaries he wrote in Australia and he says: “They make me feel sad. I was so mean and harsh on myself because I had that desperation to make the most of my height [6ft 7in], bounce and pace. Every fast bowler craves such positives and I was naturally gifted with those.”In 2013, Finn was “at my wits’ end after the first Test. We’d been in Australia for a month and I was making no progress, despite how hard I was working, and how desperately I wanted it to be better. That’s counterintuitive because the more you tense up, the less likely you are to find that rhythmical flow. I was banging my head against a brick wall and it exacerbated to the point when Ashley Giles arrived and thought: ‘Christ, this isn’t right.’”Giles’s chosen phrasehaunted Finn for years. “I hope I don’t sound harsh on Ashley but it was clumsy language and I think it damaged me.”David Saker, England’s bowling coach, had persuaded him to shorten his run-up – and Finn’s technique and mentality were shot to pieces. Richard Johnson, his Middlesex bowling coach, worked painstakingly to rebuild him. Rather than running, Finn was reduced to walking to the wicket in an attempt to liberate his mind. He could eventually jog and then run with a ball; but Finn still had to overcome the doubts wrapped around his tangled mind.His return to Test cricket in July 2015 wasan extraordinary triumph. Finn took eight wickets in thethird Ashes Test at Edgbaston, and helped England to win the Ashes.Has he watched those glorious highlights recently? “No, but a long time ago I put together this PowerPoint presentation about how to withstand the crosswinds that blow you off course – whether it’s your mindset or external judgment – and how you can still reach your end goal. For me it culminated in those wickets at Edgbaston.”View image in fullscreenFinn took eight wickets at Edgbaston to help England win the Ashes in 2015.Photograph: Philip Brown/ReutersDid he share his presentation in public? “I did it to an empty auditorium and never got further than that. I was planning for life after cricket and trying to show how the adversity I faced was related to sport, business and life. At Edgbaston my mindset was completely clear and free again. I still smile when I think about it so I might try and use the PowerPoint one day. But, back then, my life went down a different path.”Finn could not shake the lingering demons and he was besieged again by anxiety. He now believes he had failed to understand the depths to which he had sunk in 2013. “[Depression] wasn’t really spoken about by men back then. Jonathan Trott went home on that tour [with mental health difficulties] and was vilified by the press, supporters, everyone. That put my guard up because I thought you can’t display vulnerability.”Andy Flower was England’s coach on that fateful tour and, while he did show Finn some compassion, his antidote to mental turmoil was rooted in hard work. “That was my mindset throughout the tour,” Finn says as he flogged himself in solitary net sessions. “It took me being removed from the international environment, losing my central contract after I came home from Australia [and the 2017‑18 Ashes] with my knee surgery to finally speaking to an independent psychologist.”Finn sobbed after being asked a few questions by the psychologist. “I allowed myself to be vulnerable and the tears were extreme. I struggled to deal with it for the next six years. It’s only since I’ve stopped playing cricket that I feel freer.”He pauses. “I went on medication for a while because there were moments when it really flared up.”Was he on medication during the latter years of his career? “Yes. I’ve never told anyone that before, apart from my close family.”Did the medication help? “It did … but you feel a bit dead.”As a Test cricketer he was not helped by the fact that Flower believed that no fast bowler should concede more than three runs an over – especially around 2011-12. “The way we played, bowling dry, worked,” Finn concedes. “It won us games, got us to No 1 in the world, won us an away Ashes.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Maybe, yes, but I probably wouldn’t have played in a great team and won a lot of things. But, looking at it selfishly, I’d have loved to play under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum who empower their bowlers to try and take wickets.”View image in fullscreenFinn would ‘have loved to play under Ben Stokes’.Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty ImagesMcCullum played with Finn for Otago, for a short period, and briefly at Middlesex in T20. “It was liberating to be captained by him,” Finn says. “If he thought you were being too defensive he’d say: ‘Fuck it. Back yourself.’ His mantra is that cricket should be enjoyed. The more you embrace it, the more you’re going to get out of yourself.“McCullum and Stokes channel people’s energy towards the positive by trying to remove the external pressure. I know I would have responded better to them.”Finn heads to Australia next month to work as a television pundit and he is enthusiastic: “I think this is England’s best chance in 15 years to win the Ashes. This England team won’t be bullied by Australia. In 2013‑14 we were bullied by Mitchell Johnson. In 2017-2018 we were bullied by their entire team. Same in 2021-22. This team, led by Stokes, won’t take a backward step.“You need that mindset and positivity, and you need Australia to be in a little turbulence, which I think they are without Pat Cummins. I’m not sure about their openers. [Marnus]Labuschagne is scoring runs[domestically], but he’s been out of the Test team. How are they going to fit in their all-rounders [Beau] Webster and [Cameron] Green? There are a lot more question marks about Australia.”As a towering speedster, Finn must be happy that England have opted for aseriously quick pace attack? “Yes, but I’d like a more nuanced view. Some pitches have much more useful conditions for seam than pure pace.”Who is England’s key bowler? “Jofra Archer has got a massive part to play because of his ability to trouble a really settled middle order in [Travis] Head and [Steve] Smith. His pace, bounce and hostility could rip out the heart of their team. Jofra is probably our most important bowler.”View image in fullscreenFinn (back row, right) was part of England’s 2010-11 win in Australia.Photograph: Gareth Copley/PAMark Wood bowled brilliantly in the previous Ashes series in Australia, despite England losing 4‑0, and Finn says: “His pace and carry is really threatening in that part of the world. He has skill as well and he’ll never give up. They all offer something. The bounce Gus Atkinson gets, and using his wobble seam in the right conditions, could be a real threat. Brydon Carse is lionhearted and will run in all day. Josh Tongue is capable of bowling magic spells from his awkward angle.”The fitness of Stokes, especially as a bowler, is crucial. “It will be hard for him to be fit for all five Tests,” Finn says. “But I know how hard he’s working and he is critical to England because the shape and the angle he has on the ball is really threatening. I just hope that, when he wants to bowl a 15‑over spell, someone taps him on the shoulder and says: ‘Not today.’”Finn has become an outstanding pundit whose empathy deepens his analysis. “I really enjoy the punditry. But my experiences of being built up really high when I started playing, and kicked when I was down, makes me realise it’s important to have balance.”He recently took a bespoke coaching course alongside Wood, Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan and Sarah Taylor. The competitive side of coaching appeals to Finn, as does the prospect of helping young bowlers to fulfil their potential: “I’d like to be an empathetic coach who understands individuals and listens. It’s important you have a clear direction of how you want to play. But empathy is critical. I enjoy writing and I’d like to develop as a broadcaster, but I definitely wouldn’t shut the door on the coaching because I’d find it rewarding.”England look to dodge lightning strike after familiar crumble in opening ODIRead moreFinn lights up when explaining that “I get so much joy and satisfaction from working for TMS [Test Match Special]. After I retired I threw myself into TMS and did a tour of India with Aggers [Jonathan Agnew] for the World Cup. I found a really safe, happy place.”All the dark doubts of the past melt away and Finn, looking serene, smiles when I ask him what he hopes to be doing 10 years from now. “I would absolutely love to be the voice of TMS. A massive line of people would like to do the same thing – but that would be the ultimate dream.”The Ashes Files: My Pride and Pain in Cricket’s Most Intense Series, by Steven Finn, is published on 6 NovemberIn the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111.

They said he spoke too much; they replied that, yeah, theywouldsee him outside; they told him talk is cheap. And that was just the players: there was more from the preachers in their pulpits, men who never lose.On the eve of the clásico, the teenager who claims he left fear behind in Mataró suggested that Real Madrid rob and moan, or so it goes. He also offered a reminder thatthe last time he had been at the Santiago Bernabéu– a kid withblaugranabraces, a glint in his eye and a right foot they didn’t know he had –he beat them 4-0. But that was then and this was now. And, an adult now, exactly a year on,he was beaten back. He knew, they told him so.Bellingham scores clásico winner as Real Madrid pull clear of BarcelonaRead moreWhen the final whistle went on a wild, intense 262nd clásico that was a little like old times, as Lamine Yamal and Dani Carvajal came together post game, Madrid’s captain did the old jibber-jabber gesture. It had been hard enough keeping up with everything that happened in the 105 minutes that went before, a match of 38 shots, three goals scored and three more disallowed; now it was impossible.Suddenly there were players everywhere, racing in and out of sight and piling in, police pulling people apart. In the middle of the melee, Thibaut Courtois was accepting the invitation to continue this down the tunnel. Vinícius was being held back,himtelling someoneelsethey talk to much. Raphinha was running to stop his countryman, Antonio Rüdiger there too. “It was like when we young,” Aurélien Tchouaméni said.In April, Tchouaméni had written: “They celebrate our defeats like we will never win again. We’ll be back.” Madrid had just lost aclásico Copa del Rey final 3-2in extra time, a collective breakdown greeting the final whistle, ice cubes flying. A fortnight later, they were beaten again. In four clásicos, Madrid had lost four times, league, cup and Super Cup going to their rivals. They had conceded four, five, three and four. But there is always tomorrow and it turned out Tchouaméni was right.Only once had Barcelona ever won five clásicos in a row, Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking run concluding withthat5-0against José Mourinho’s side, and it wouldn’t happen again. On Sunday, Madrid ended Hansi Flick’s perfect record in charge, beating Barcelona 2-1 to go five points clear at the top of the table.Madrid had needed this. The celebration said so, players dancing in circles. So did the noise, the Bernabéu louder and more edgy than on a clásico day for years: “incredible,” Jude Bellingham called it. The coach said so too. Asked if this was a weight off his shoulders, if there had been a psychosis around important matches, an obsession, Xabi Alonso shot back: “That’s you lot’s thing.” But he did admit that this was “not just three points, but where we come from and what it means to us; the boys needed that feeling of winning a big game.”View image in fullscreenDani Carvajal doesn’t miss the opportunity to taunt Lamine Yamal after the final whistle.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesLast season Madrid had not won any. Fourteen times they were defeated: Lille, Milan, Liverpool, Athletic, Espanyol, Betis, Atlético, Valencia and Arsenal all beat them. There wasn’t a single win against a truly big side. Carlo Ancelotti went and was replaced by Alonso but it continued. Madrid won five games at the Club World Cup, signs of a structure emerging, an idea, butthen came Paris Saint Germain.That belongs to last season, Alonso said. But the next season,hisseason, started with six wins in a row until Atlético came andputfivepast them. It was all well and goodbeating Oviedo, Mallorca and Osasuna but what about the big teams? Now at last they had beaten one of them too. And it wasn’t just that Madrid won, it was the way they won.Barcelona had players out: Joan García, Gavi, Dani Olmo, Robert Lewandowski and Andreas Christensen were all missing. So too Raphinha,whose significancemay at least be fully recognised in absentia. Others weren’t fully fit, Jules Koundé and Lamine Yamal among them. On the bench they had five players who hadn’t started a league game, two more who had started only once; two 17-year-olds, four 18-year-olds and two who are 19. And a centre-back, Ronald Araújo, whoended it up front again. Even their manager was missing, Flick suspended and stuck in a radio cabin. Marcus Sorg, his assistant, has been on the touchline three times: he has lost all of them.Much is made of Barcelona’s vulnerable high line, but they did not attack well on Sunday. Of all the things that were said to Lamine Yamal on Sunday, perhaps the most telling came from Vinícius during the game, taunting the teenager by telling him: “You’re all backwards passes.” As for that backline, more porous than before with Iñigo Martínez leaving, the pressure on passers dropping and the timing off, Levante made six clear chances against them,Rayo five,Sevilla five, Girona three. Last year theycaught Kylian Mbappé offside eight timesin an open clásico; yet, lost amid the defeats, was that in the last meetinghe got a hat-trick, Madrid always likely to get opportunities now.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowReal Sociedad 2-1 Sevilla, Girona 3-3 Oviedo, Espanyol 1-0 Elche, Athletic Club 0-1 Getafe, Valencia 0-2 Villarreal, Mallorca 1-1 Levante, Real Madrid 2-1 Barcelona, Osasuna 2-3 Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano 1-0 AlavésMondayReal Betis v Atlético Madrid (8pm GMT)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Playing like this, especially. This was a start as well as an end in itself. “In the future we’re going to need a lot of what we did today,” Alonso said. They put the ball in the net five times – three ruled out for offside – missed a penalty, took 23 shots and scored twice, the surprise that it was only that many. Mbappé got one, from just right of the centre again, the doubt about he and Vinícius occupying the same, left-sided spaces allayed. Bellingham got the other. “A tap-in,” he said afterwards, speaking in Spanish. “People say it’s easy but it’s about how I understand the game.” Wojciech Szczesny madeninesaves.For an hour or so, Madrid went forBarcelona, chances happening quicker than you could note them down. They pressed all the way to Szczesny; from his feet and those of the full-backs, the ball tended to be given back to them. They didn’t let Pedri play, Eduardo Camavinga taking particular responsibility. Bellingham was superb, scoring one, setting up the other with a wonderful turn and pass, and forcing the penalty.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham scored one and assisted the other in Real Madrid’s 2-1 win.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersIf intermittent, Vinícius went at Koundé, described in one paper as “defending like a security guard at the Louvre” – although attention was drawn more to the Brazilian’s furious reaction to being substituted, stomping off and straight down the tunnel on 71 minutes shouting: “I’ll leave the team.”That was about the time that the pace dropped and Barcelona took control. But while Pedri led and Lamine Yamal came inside, little really came of it. “We didn’t suffer much,” Carvajal insisted. And if a glorious pass from Lamine Yamal should have set up Koundé, who miscontrolled on his chest, and if Carvajal took a risk barging over Araújo, the better chances remained Madrid’s. All the way to the moment when Lamine Yamal was definitively defeated and it all kicked off.It had started with the YouTuber Ibai Llanos suggesting Porcinos were the Kings League’s Real Madrid, but it wasn’t going to end there. Lamine Yamal, an 18-year-old sitting with a bunch of mates in a streamer’s studio previewing a seven-a-side league for influencers and celebrities – silliness and shit-stirring as standard –laughed and replied: “Yeah, they rob, they moan.” That was followed, as the storm started, by an Instagram post of him at the Bernabéu last year: he stands blurred, defeated fans in sharp focus behind him. The message was clear: he was not about to back down.It was like Lamine Yamal. Heavy is the head that wears the crown but he likes taking the pressure for himself,performing his own coronationafter every goal. It’s not bragging if you can back it up, as Muhammad Ali said, and no one seemed to mind whenhe put Adrien Rabiot in checkmate. Not everyone saw the funny side this time, those who live by confrontation and noise handing out lessons in ethics and etiquette, a single line soon the centre of everything. In the pre-match press conference, when Alonso was asked about it for thefourthtime despite not saying anything to the first three, dismissing talk of extra motivation what with it being a clásico, he replied: “This again?”Twenty-four hours later, victory secured and asked about it again, Madrid’s manager rightly noted: “I don’t want to take the focus from what truly matters,” but fear not: everyone else would do that. “I’m the one who caused all this fuss,” Llanos lamented. Frenkie de Jong called the fallout “exaggerated”, insisted that Lamine Yamal hadn’t explicitly said Madrid were robbers, and that Carvajal could always call him rather than make gestures on the pitch. As for Tchouaméni, he smiled and said: “I like it. It’s only words; there’s no bad intentions. If he wants to talk, no problem.”Between them, they had cut through the bullshit, only it wasn’t just bullshit any more. It was there and it mattered to some. “Talk is cheap,”Bellingham wrote on Instagramwhen it was all over, Elvis Presley’s “A Little Less Conversation” accompanying his post. Madrid had been waiting to win at last and waiting for Lamine Yamal too, fans and players. Now he had lost as they could speak, the roar that little louder, the release that little greater. The rivalry even, something like it used to be. And what, the former Madrid midfielder Guti asked, is this game without a ruckus? “In those years back then, it all happened,” Alonso said. “It’s football, it’s the clásico.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid1012272Barcelona1013223Villarreal108204Espanyol103185Atletico Madrid96166Real Betis95167Rayo Vallecano102148Elche101149Athletic Bilbao10-11410Getafe10-21411Sevilla1011312Alaves1001213Celta Vigo10-21014Osasuna10-31015Levante10-4916Mallorca10-4917Real Sociedad10-4918Valencia10-6919Oviedo10-12720Girona10-137Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballBarcelonaReal MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are no friendlies in football. We want to win every game. We want to perform well.”Sarina Wiegman said she was looking forward to the meeting at Derby’s Pride Park. “They are a top-level team and will challenge us in the way we want to be challenged,” the head coach said. “I’m not really looking back at the World Cup semi-final – it was an incredible semi-final by the way. They have a new coach and we have moved on.”Eleven of the Australia squad named by Joe Montemurro for games against Wales and England are playing in the WSL. One of them, the Arsenal defender Steph Catley, said that would bring its advantages. “You play against them and know the strengths and weaknesses of each player,” she said. “I don’t think it changes it too much though.”Australia beat Wales 2-1 on Saturday, Sam Kerr starting for the first time since an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in January 2024. They have won two of Montemurro’s four games, defeating then drawing with Slovenia in June and losing to Panama in July, with England their first major test under the former Arsenal manager.England lost 2-1 to Brazil on Saturdayafter conceding first for the fourth time in as many games. In the preceding three, at the Euros, they came back and the team ended up lifting a second title. Wiegman denied there was an endemic problem.“In the Spain game we started well and we could have scored and taken a 1-0 lead,” she said ofthe final, before reflecting on other Euros matches. “In the Italy game we could have scored and taken a 1-0 lead. Inthe Sweden gamewe didn’t start that well. Inthe France gamewe started really well and they scored the first goal. So, I don’t agree that we always have slow starts. Last Saturday we didn’t start well enough. We had to get more physical. We talked about that in the review of the match. The players felt the same.

In exchange, Israel has agreed to hand over 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli.Hamas’s military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, said on Monday it would deliver the body of a deceased hostage at 9pm local time, Reuters reported. Israeli media confirmed the IDF was working with the Red Cross to receive the remains in the evening.Hamas has so far returned the remains of 15 of those held captive but some of the others are believed to be in areas beyond theyellow line marking the Israeli withdrawal. If the identity of the deceased hostage delivered on Monday is confirmed, it would mean the remains of 12 hostages remain in Gaza. Hamas says it faces obstacles to locating them in the rubble left by the bombardment.“At the request of the parties, the International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday accompanied a party to the conflict as the party searched for the remains of the deceased past the IDF-designated ‘yellow line’,” said Sarah Davies, an ICRC spokesperson.“The parties to the conflict determined the modalities of the operation and entrusted the ICRC to act as a neutral intermediary. The ICRC was not involved in those negotiations.”Davies added: “The ICRC was not involved in the search for the deceased nor does it take part in the physical recovery of remains.” A Red Cross official confirmed that the party it accompanied on the search was Hamas.View image in fullscreenMembers of the ICRC watch an excavator digging, reportedly in a search for bodies in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood east of Gaza City, on Monday.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/ShutterstockUnder international humanitarian law, it is the responsibility of the parties involved in a conflict to search for, collect, and retrieve human remains.On Saturday, Donald Trump issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the militant group. “Hamas is going to have to start returning the bodies of the deceased hostages, including two Americans, quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action,” Trump wrote on his social media platform.As the 48-hour deadline neared, Hamas, accompanied by the ICRC, joined Egyptian teams authorised by Israel to search for remains beyond the line marking the Israeli military’s pullback insideGaza. An Israeli spokesperson said the Egyptian team would use excavator machines and trucks in the search.Footage published by Qatar’s Al Araby network appeared to show members of Hamas’s “Shadow Unit” – part of the group’s military wing tasked with guarding hostages – accompanying a Red Cross vehicle in al-Mawasi near Rafah, which lies outside Israeli military control. The news was later corroborated by Israeli and Palestinian media.Shosh Bedrosian, an Israeli government spokesperson, said representatives of Hamas, alongside the Red Cross and the Egyptian technical team, “have been permitted to enter beyond the yellow line position in Gaza under close [Israeli army] supervision to identify the location of our hostages”.Felesteen, the largest news outlet in circulation in Gaza before the war, described by Israel as a “Hamas daily”, said on Monday: “Members of the Qassam brigades accompanied teams from the International Committee of the Red Cross during field visits to areas beyond the yellow line in the Gaza Strip and the city of Rafah, to inspect sites believed to contain the bodies of Israeli soldiers and prisoners.”The search for the bodies of Israeli hostages has become one of the most sensitive issues in the ceasefire. The effort to locate the remains has proved difficult, given the presence of an estimated 60m tonnes of debris across the strip, where, according to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 10,000 Palestinians are recorded as missing, buried under the rubble.View image in fullscreenStaff from the ICRC have been working with an Egyptian team and machinery in the search.Photograph: Omar Ashtawy/APAImages/ShutterstockHamas has said it does not know the precise whereabouts of all the bodies, saying it has lost contact with several of its units that had been holding the captives and were reportedly killed during Israeli bombardments.However, on Sunday an Israeli government spokesperson said Hamas knew the whereabouts of the bodies. “If Hamas made more of an effort, they would be able to retrieve the remains of our hostages,” the spokesperson said.Although Trump has conceded that some of the bodies are difficult to reach, he said “others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not”. “It may have to do with the disarming of Hamas,” he added.Washington said it had received assurances from Hamas that the group would disarm, though no timeline has been set. The militant organisation remains reluctant to surrender its weapons without firm guarantees about the future of its fighters.Israel has made Hamas’s disarmament a central objective, describing it as a key condition for bringing an end to the two-year war.Yet on Sunday, Hamas’s chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the group’s weapons were “tied to the existence of occupation and aggression”. “If the occupation ends, these weapons will be handed over to the state,” he said. It remained unclear whether he was alluding to the still-unformed Palestinian governing authority expected to take over Gaza’s administration once Hamas relinquishes control.Another key element in cementing the truce will be the creation of a stabilisation force that will operate within the territory. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose diplomats took part in the ceasefire negotiations, had expressed his government’s willingness to take part in the force.However, on Monday the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said only countries that were “at least fair” to Israel could send troops to secure Gaza and ruled out Turkey’s participation. He said: “During the last four years and even before that, Erdoğan led a hostile approach against Israel. It is not reasonable for us to let their armed forces enter [the] Gaza Strip.”Explore more on these topicsHamasIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Hayes maintained his innocence and claimed during his original trial that he was taking part in an “industry-wide” practice, accusing regulators ofmaking him a scapegoat.Hayes is now seeking recompense for the suffering he says he faced as a result of his original ruling.He is suingUBSfor “malicious prosecution”, and says UBS conducted a “fundamentally flawed” investigation in order to pin the blame on Hayes.Efforts to sue UBS come months after the UK supreme courtoverturned a decade-old rulingagainst Hayes in July. That decision was based on faults in the original trial, with the original judge determined to have given “inaccurate and unfair” instructions to the jury that found Hayes guilty on charges of conspiracy to defraud. This meant the former banker was ultimately deprived of a fair trial.However, the supreme court judges stopped short of fully exonerating Hayes, saying there was “ample evidence” that could have led a jury, if properly directed, to find him guilty. “But the jury was not properly directed,” the ruling explained, adding: “The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.”Commenting on the lawsuit against UBS, Hayes said: “It has taken me over a decade to overturn my wrongful conviction and clear my name. My legal team are now rightlyfully holding UBS to account for scapegoating me in order to save billions in fines and protect its senior executives.“My life was ruined by the bank’s actions – I lost my liberty and my marriage, missed out on my son’s childhood, and my physical and mental health suffered terribly. UBS also destroyed my reputation and career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One said they had expected a budget as high as £2bn to hit the target.RenewableUK, an industry lobby group, said the budget would cover only about a quarter of the 20 gigawatts of projects that have planning permission and would be eligible. The group’s executive director of policy, Ana Musat, said: “The budget announced today will not maximise investment in new offshore wind farms.”Renewables provided about half of the UK’s electricity during 2024, with wind accounting for30% of generationfor the first time – overtaking gas power stations. Further huge investments in wind and solar would be necessary to meet the target of completely removing carbon emissions from British electricity supplies by 2030.Government sources have previously saidministers might consider abandoning the 2030 target– long seen as hugely ambitious by experts – if it were to add too much to household bills. The Labour government’s clean electricity target is opposed by theConservativeparty andReform, who say they would ditch net zero policies.A government source disputed that the 2030 target was in question, saying the initial budget for offshore wind showed “big backing by the Treasury”.Wind power developers, expected to include the energy companies SSE, RWE and ScottishPower, will be invited to bid to build offshore wind projects, which would be eligible to receive the new funds.In a change from previous years, the final budget could rise higher if ministers consider enough projects provide value for money – potentially surpassing the£1.1bn allocated to offshore wind last year. The contracts would also last 20 years, rather than 15, in order to try to attract lower prices.Chris Stark, the civil servant wholeads the UK’s clean power efforts under Miliband, said he expected the bids to exceed the funding allocated for fixed offshore wind. The government was prepared to “contract more offshore wind generation if we see value for money for the consumer”, he said in a social media post.Michael Shanks, the minister of state for energy, said: “This auction is another step towards delivering the clean power this country needs to end our reliance on volatile global gas prices, ensuring our energy security and bringing down bills for good.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If prices are below that bar, called a strike price, the government tops up the difference, while generators must pay back the government for any earnings above that price. The whole budget would be spent only if energy prices were to stay lower than expected for a sustained period of time.Jess Ralston, head of energy at theEnergyand Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “Every bit of free wind and sun power that we harness means we need to buy less foreign gas from abroad, boosting our energy security.”Explore more on these topicsWind powerRenewable energyEnergyEd MilibandnewsShareReuse this content"

Scientists this monthwarned that a tipping point had been reachedwhereby corals around the world are set to be wiped out due to global heating, which is raising heat to intolerable levels in our oceans.“We’re running out of time,” said Ross Cunning, lead author of the new Florida study and a research biologist at Shedd Aquarium. “Extreme heatwaves are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change, and without immediate, ambitious actions to slow ocean warming and boost coral resilience, we risk the extinction of even more corals from reefs in Florida and around the world.”Planet’s first catastrophic climate tipping point reached, report says, with coral reefs facing ‘widespread dieback’Read moreThe new research,published in the Science journal, analyzed the fate of staghorn (Acropora cervicornis) and elkhorn (Acropora palmata) corals off the Florida coast following a severe marine heatwave in 2023, which raised temperatures on Florida’s fraying coral reefs to their highest levels in over 150 years.The two species are complex, reef-building corals and are named because they resemble, respectively, the antlers of stags and elks. However, researchers who conducted diver surveys of more than 52,000 colonies of the species, across 391 sites along Florida’s coast, found widespread, often devastating, losses.Along the Florida Keys, mortality rates reached 98% and even 100%, revealing a complete annihilation of the corals. In south-east Florida, where temperatures have been cooler, mortality rates were lower, at about 38%.The twoAcroporaspecies had alreadysufferedfrom decades of localized impacts in Florida, such as poor water quality coming from pollutants that wash off the land, as well as disease. But the 2023 heatwave has proved fatal for these heat-sensitive species.The 2023 event caused the ninth episode of bleaching on the Florida reef – aprocesswhereby corals become heat-stressed andexpel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to become ghostly white. If temperatures remain elevated, the corals die off completely.Globally, coral reefs are among the ecosystems most vulnerable to the human-caused climate crisis. This poses a major threat to a quarter of all ocean life that relies upon what are essentially the rainforests of the sea, as well as hundreds of millions of people who depend upon corals to support fish that they can consume and gain an income from.Corals also act as a barrier to protect our shorelines from powerful storms, which are themselves being worsened by rising global temperatures.In a desperate attempt to prevent a death spiral of threatened corals, scientists have established repositories ofAcroporain aquariums and offshore coral nurseries. Attempts havebeen made to reseed corals on reefs in Florida, too, in an effort to regain some of the 90% of coral cover lost off the state in the past four decades.But as global heating continues to escalate, there is little hope of long-term survival of these species without major interventions, researchers warn.“Elkhorn corals, in particular, are some of the most important wave-breaking coral species in the region,” said Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami and another study co-author.“They used to be common on shallow reef crests in the Caribbean, and if we want our reefs to continue protecting our coastlines from flooding during storms, its worth taking extraordinary measures to ensure we don’t lose these corals altogether.”Explore more on these topicsCoralMarine lifeOceansFloridaClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump authorized a federal disaster declaration – which frees up crucial federal assistance – on Thursday, nearly a week after being requested by Dunleavy.“This is directly keeping funding out of the hands of disaster survivors who need it,”wroteemergency management expert Samantha Montano in a post on social media, alsocallingthe delay “absolutely insane”.“This disaster is of a severity that the request would have normally been signed within a day of receiving a governor’s request. Not doing so is a deeply alarming departure from what Americans have come to expect from the federal government in times of disaster,” Montano said.View image in fullscreenPeople from Tuntutuliak, Alaska, arrive in Bethel on 17 October on an Alaska national guard helicopter.Photograph: Marc Lester/APA presidential disaster declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist with state, local and tribal authorities in recovery.

The city has taken the rare step ofdeclaring its own civil emergency– despite the storm itself having struck 500 miles to the west.In addition to the delayed federal response, a majority of westernAlaska’s weather balloon network was not operatingduring the landfall of the storm last weekend due to staffing constraints inflicted by the Trump administration, current and former National Weather Service officials have confirmed to the Guardian.The remnant circulation of Typhoon Halong was able to maintain considerable strength overnear-record warm waters of the Bering Seaand packed winds exceeding 100mph in addition to record coastal flooding before taking a rare track from the tropical Pacific directly to Alaska.Meteorologists said Trump’s cuts in weather balloons probably negatively affected the weather forecast, which had large errors in the day before landfall – complicating the warning process in advance of one of the most destructive storms in state history.“It seems likely that that had some effect on the model performance,” wrote Rick Thoman, a former National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist, ina post for the Conversation. “This one’s final track and intensity weren’t clear until the storm was within 36 hours of crossing into Alaska waters. That’s too late for evacuations in many places.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

KYUK, a Native-owned public radio station in Bethel, the largest town in the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta,lost 70% of its funding last monthwhen the Trump administration dissolved the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.In April, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the parent organization of the NWS,instituted what it called “degraded operations”in response to staffing cuts made by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”. Among the steps wasreducing the number of weather balloon launchesin some of its most remote offices in the midwest and Alaska – limiting the amount of information meteorologists have to make warning decisions.“We have been managing up here,” an Alaska-based federal meteorologist said. “We are understaffed, though. It seems like there is more on all our plates with the staffing shortages.” The meteorologist requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.In an emailed statement to the Guardian, a Noaa spokesperson, Kim Doster, wrote: “The NWS Alaska region remains adequately staffed to meet its mission of protecting lives and property. Despite the difficulty of forecasting weather events across the northern Pacific and Bering Sea given the lack of data availability over the open ocean, the NWS models in this instance did identify the potential for a high impact event days in advance, allowing IDSS (Impact-Based Decision Support Services) to begin communicating with public officials and emergency responders as early as October 9th.”The crisis has drawn attention tothe region’s worsening vulnerability to rising sea levelsdue to the climate crisis, and to the Trump administration’s cuts to federal grants aimed at helping the region mitigate disaster risks.In particular,a $20m Environmental Protection Agency grant was terminatedby the Trump administration earlier this year that was intended in part to improve flood protection to the same communities hit by last week’s storm.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Parkinson and Tom Little, the prosecutor in charge of the case, said the evidence given by Collins was behind the decision, while Collins said he was surprised that prosecutors had decided to pull the charges.Collins admitted that before the case collapsed, it was made clear to him by prosecutors that “they were looking for a precise formulation of words” in his statement, but insisted he could only give evidence on the basis of Tory government policy between 2021 and 2023.However, he said he would have detailed the range of threats posed by China under cross-examination. “The way I would have answered the question under cross-examination would have been to go through all of the areas where I have specified in my witness statements … the range of threats that we see from China,” Collins told the committee.He said he included language in his final witness statement reflecting the Labour government’s policy on the request of counter-terrorism police, and that he drew the relevant line from a minister’s answer to a parliamentary question. Collins said no political pressure had been placed on him to reflect Labour’s position and that he had never discussed the details of the case with Jonathan Powell, the national security adviser.Parkinson said the insertion of that line, which mirrors language used to describe China in the Labour manifesto, did not contribute to the decision to pull charges. He stressed that it was what was missing from Collins’s evidence, rather than what it contained, that led to the decision.“Ultimately, the issue in this case is that we were not able to provide the evidence to sustain the case in respect of one essential element, which was the element that China was an enemy, as was required by the statute,” Parkinson told the committee.Asked whether he ever had “the feeling that the government wanted this case to fail”, Parkinson said: “Nothing reached me.” The DPP told peers and MPs that no “reasonable jury” could have been properly directed to conclude China was a threat to the UK’s national security.‘You’re in spy territory’: how two UK nationals got tangled in a Chinese espionage rowRead moreMPs have questioned why prosecutors did not continue with the case and allow a jury to make a decision based on the charges. Parkinson and Little argued that because of Collins’s evidence, lawyers for the defence could have made a submission there was “no case to answer”, meaning the case would never have reached a jury.Collins said the first time he became aware the trial could collapse was at a meeting with prosecutors on 3 September. Little said he had articulated prosecutors’ concerns about his evidence at a meeting on 14 August.Asked to compare the Labour government’s policy towards China and the approach the Conservatives had pursued, Collins said there were no major differences.“I think there are differences in points of emphasis,” he told the committee. “There are definitely differences in the language that is used. The Labour government at the moment has been quite clearly wanting to ensure that it engages with China. However, the previous Conservative government also wanted to engage with China.”Explore more on these topicsEspionageChinaCrown Prosecution ServicenewsShareReuse this content"

A total of 121 (52%) said that family or friends in Afghanistan had been threatened by the Taliban.Olivia Clark, the executive director of Refugee Legal Support, which conducted the research in partnership with academics from Lancaster and York Universities, said: “This research lays bare the devastating human consequences of the MoD data breach. By centring Afghan voices and documenting their experiences, it fills a critical gap in understanding the real-world impact of the breach.“Afghans who served alongside UK forces have faced renewed threats, violent assaults, and even the killing of family members after their personal details were exposed.Writing Hawa review – Afghan woman fights for freedom as the Taliban close inRead more“The UK government must act urgently to ensure their safety, accelerate relocation applications, and provide proper redress for those whose lives have been put at risk.”Details of nearly 19,000 people who had applied to move to the UK after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan wereleaked mistakenlyin February 2022 by a British official. The previous government found out about this in August 2023 when details were posted on Facebook.A superinjunction blocking reporting about the breach was subsequently imposed preventing details being reported until July of this year, when it was lifted.The Daily Telegraphreportedin July that more than 200 former Afghan soldiers and police officers were killed in the wake of the data breach. However, it is not known how many of them had their names included on the data leak list.However, an MoD spokesperson referred to a previous review, arguing “it is highly unlikely that merely being on a spreadsheet would be grounds for an individual to be targeted”.A former Afghan National Army member inAfghanistan, who took part in the research, said: “The delay between the discovery of the data breach in 2023 and the communication in July 2025 is deeply concerning and unacceptable. Waiting almost two years to inform individuals that their personal data was compromised has put many lives at risk unnecessarily.“Immediate notification could have allowed us to take protective measures much earlier. This delay shows a serious lack of urgency and responsibility from the Ministry of Defence, especially considering the sensitive nature of our backgrounds and the high-risk environment we live in.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He cited evacuation of farmers, barbers and gardeners before some members of the UK special forces who were likely to be at higher risk from theTaliban.One British Afghan who submitted evidence described the MoD’s failure to protect sensitive information as “a reckless breach and betrayal of trust” while others said highly qualified Afghans who had been brought to the UK were working in jobs they were overqualified for, such as delivery driving.A resettlement scheme for those affected by the breach, the Afghanistan Response Route, set up in April 2024 after Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government learned of the breach, has enabled 4,500 Afghans so far to arrive in the UK.An MoD spokesperson said:“The independent Rimmer review, conducted based on existing assessments, expertise and reflections from current Afghanistan work, focused on those most able to provide a high level of insight into the current situation as of spring 2025, and concluded that it is highly unlikely that merely being on the spreadsheet would be grounds for an individual to be targeted.”Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceAfghanistanSuperinjunctionsData protectionTalibannewsShareReuse this content"

She said: “Three years of finding out my journey and who I am it feels like ages, so actually I can’t imagine …”Her lawyer, Tom Price KC, asked Wandelt if she disliked the McCanns. She said: “No, I always defended them, I still even now defend them.”She said she “never” meant any harm to the family.Wandelt also told her trial she believed the police were “not interested” in finding Madeleine and that she believed the girl’s parents had been “misled” by officers.Asked why she had contacted Gerry McCann directly, she said: “Because I think they were misled because if the police treated their daughter’s case the way they treated me, I’m not surprised they didn’t find their daughter, and I think they should know because my case is just an example of how police [are] still abusing cases.“It is 18 years since Madeleine disappeared … the police are not interested in finding Kate and Gerry’s daughter, that is my opinion.”Wandelt became emotional when talking about her contact with Madeleine’s sister Amelie McCann and the memories she had of her childhood, adding that she had been through “three years of hell” and still did not know who she was.Wandelt told the stalking trial she had “tried everything”, including contacting Interpol, the Metropolitan police and missing persons charities, before she went to the McCanns.She told the court: “I did not want to contact Kate and Gerry and the McCann family until I contacted every single person I can.”Questioned about hate she had received from members of the public, Wandelt said: “There was a bounty on my head … I don’t know if it was a joke but someone did this … I was getting a lot of hate, people wishing I would die.”Wandelt told the court that she had limited memories of her childhood and “could only remember abuse” after experiences with her step-grandfather. She told the court she had self-harmed and attempted suicide after she was abused by him.Wandelt said a sketch of a suspect in the Madeleine case looked “quite similar to the person who abused me” and had the same surname, which she said was a “big factor” in her believing she was the girl.She told the court she had not known how big Madeleine’s story was before she read about the case, and denied claiming to be Madeleine for attention or money.Asked about her motivation to claim to be Madeleine, she told the court she “could not be able to heal from my trauma if I never fully know who I am”.Wandelt said she had spoken to her parents many times about taking a DNA test, partly because they look different to her, which they refused. She told the court she still questions her identity.Wandelt and her co-defendant, Karen Spragg, 61, of Caerau Court Road in Caerau, Cardiff, both deny one count of stalking between June 2022 and February this year.Wandelt will continue her evidence on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

But those who appeared on the ballot on Saturday – the former first lady Simone Gbagbo and three former ministers Jean-Louis Billon, Ahoua Don Mello and Henriette Lagou Adjoua – were unable to make headway.‘Dare to change’: Ivory Coast heads to the polls as rivals seek to oust OuattaraRead moreThe result trumps Ouattara’s winning margins in his previous three victories, including his 2015 win, when he secured 83% of the vote. Lagou Adjoua, who also contested in 2015, improved her previous record of 0.89% by getting 1.15%.On Sunday evening, Billon, a former trade minister, congratulated Ouattara in a concession statement on social media, saying his decision had been informed by partial results he had seen. Billon ended up being runner-up with 3% of the tally.Barring any surprise from the Constitutional Council during the stipulated five-day period, the octogenarian, who has been in office since 2011, will lead the world’s largest cocoa producer until 2030. Ouattara has supervised high economic growth rates and vast infrastructural development, but has been accused of crony capitalism and a clampdown on opposition to his rule.Despite 8.7 million people being registered to vote, the election was marked by low turnout in urban areas, especially within the commercial capital of Abidjan. At multiple polling units in the densely populated communes of Yopougon and Cocody, officials said fewer than 50 voters had come in by midday.The CEI said turnout was approximately 50%.Some observers said the low turnout inadvertently led to what has been the country’s most peaceful election in years. In 2010, after the former president Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat to Ouattara, a deadlock ensued that led to the death of an estimated 3,000 people in the months that followed. Ten years later, more than 50 people were killed as Ouattara secured a controversial third mandate.Before the vote, there had been tensions as youths ransacked the electoral commission’s office in Yamoussoukro, the political capital, leading the authorities to declare a curfew from 10pm to 6am on the eve of the election and after voting ended. Earlier this month, more than 250 protesters were arrested, with 32 handed three-year sentences, leaving the country on edge.Human rights groups had also noted the heavy deployment of security personnel before and during the election, raising alarm about the sidelining of prominent opposition figures and a clampdown on dissent.Explore more on these topicsIvory CoastAlassane OuattaraAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The cuts come months after the retail giant’s CEOwarned white-collar employeestheir jobs could be taken by artificial intelligence.The Seattle-based technology firm is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning Tuesday, media outlets includingReutersandthe Wall Street Journalreported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, as it tries to cut costs and undo the vast recruitment drive it embarked on at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which unleashed an extraordinary – but fleeting – surge in demand for online shopping.While the layoffs would represent a small portions of Amazon’s sprawling global workforce of 1.55 million employees, they would hit about 10% of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees.CNBCcalled it the largest layoff in the company’s history.Amazon declined to comment. Shares in the firm, which is scheduled to report quarterly earnings later this week, rose 1.2% on Monday.Other giants of the internet have likewise backtracked on the major hiring undertaken during the coronavirus pandemic. Microsoft; Meta, parent of Whatsapp, Instagram and Facebook; and Alphabet, parent of Google and YouTube, have all laid off tens of thousands of workers in the past three years.Back in June, the group’s CEO, Andy Jassy, told employees that AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – and generative AI systems such as chatbots would require fewer employees in some areas.“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy wrote in a memo to staff.In recent years, Amazon has been trimming smaller numbers of jobs across multiple divisions, including devices, communications, podcasting and others.This week’s wave of cuts is expected to affect a wide variety of divisions within Amazon, including human resources, known as people experience and technology, devices and services and operations, among others. Fortunereportedthat as many as 15% of the firm’s HR roles could be hit, citing multiple sources familiar with Amazon’s plans.Managers of affected teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following notifications that will start going out via email tomorrow morning, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources.Jassy has been undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by reducing the number of managers, and introduced an anonymous complaint line for claims of inefficiencies that has elicited about 1,500 responses and more than 450 process changes, he said earlier this year.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

The aircraft … did not violate the borders of other states,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So listen now,” he said at the time.The systemmade headlines in 2019after a failed test in the Arctic causedan explosionthat killed at least five scientists.Putin’s boasts aside, experts have cast doubt on the missile’s supposed invincibility.“Russia’s nuclear-powered cruise missile Burevestnik isn’t invincible … Nato aircraft could intercept it,” Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute, in Monterey, California, wrote on X. “The problem is that Burevestnik represents another step in an arms race that offers no victory for either side.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Kremlin has recently criticised Trump’s push to develop a missile shield – known asthe Golden Dome–which he claimswould make the US impervious to attack.Last November, Moscow lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, a move widely seen as signalling its readiness to respond aggressively to perceived threats.Soon after, Russia deployed its new nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile on the battlefield in Ukraine.The timing of Russia’s Burevestnik testing is notable, coming amid the Kremlin’s intensified nuclear posturing and a break in US-Russia talks over the war in Ukraine.Last week, Putin oversaw drills of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces, which included practice missile launches. He also warned of a “very serious, if not crushing, response” should Ukraine carry out further strikes deep inside Russian territory with western-supplied missiles.View image in fullscreenThe Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile was first unveiled in 2018 when images of its production line were released.Photograph: YoutubeRussian state television on Sunday openly framed the drills as a warning to the west.Sergei Karaganov, a hawkish and influential foreign policy analyst, said during a talkshow that the exercise amounted to “a rehearsal for a first strike, intended as punishment or a warning in the event of further aggression against Russia”.Relations between Putin and Trump took a serious hit after the US administration announced surprise sanctions last Wednesday on two of Russia’s largest oil producers and around three dozen of their subsidiaries – measures that could severely undermine Moscow’s vital energy revenues.Further irritation with Washington was evident in an interview over the weekend by Russia’s veteran foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who said the Trump administration’s position on the war in Ukraine had “radically changed”.In the interview with a Hungarian reporter, Lavrov criticised Trump’s call for Russia and Ukraine to freeze the frontlines and agree to a ceasefire – an idea Moscow has rejected.Explore more on these topicsRussiaUkraineDonald TrumpVladimir PutinUS foreign policyNuclear weaponsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The finding, part of an update on how the chatbot handles sensitive conversations, is one of the most direct statements from the artificial intelligence giant on the scale of how AI can exacerbate mental health issues.In addition to its estimates on suicidal ideations and related interactions, OpenAI also said that about 0.07 of users active in a given week – about 560,000 of its touted800m weekly users– show “possible signs of mental health emergencies related to psychosis or mania”. The post cautioned that these conversations were difficult to detect or measure, and that this was an initial analysis.As OpenAI releases data on mental health issues related to its marquee product, the company is facing increased scrutinyfollowing a highly publicized lawsuitfrom the family of a teenage boy who died by suicide after extensive engagement with ChatGPT. The Federal Trade Commission last month additionallylaunched a broad investigationinto companies that create AI chatbots, including OpenAI, to find how they measure negative impacts on children and teens.ChatGPT ‘upgrade’ giving more harmful answers than previously, tests findRead moreOpenAI claimed in its post that its recentGPT-5 updatereduced the number of undesirable behaviors from its product and improved user safety in a model evaluation involving more than 1,000 self-harm and suicide conversations. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.“Our new automated evaluations score the new GPT‑5 model at 91% compliant with our desired behaviors, compared to 77% for the previous GPT‑5 model,” the company’s post reads.OpenAI stated that GPT-5 expanded access to crisis hotlines and added reminders for users to take breaks during long sessions. To make improvements to the model, the company said it enlisted 170 clinicians from its Global Physician Network of health care experts to assist its research over recent months, which included rating the safety of its model’s responses and helping write the chatbot’s answers to mental-health related questions.“As part of this work, psychiatrists and psychologists reviewed more than 1,800 model responses involving serious mental health situations and compared responses from the new GPT‑5 chat model to previous models,” OpenAI said. The company’s definition of “desirable” involved determining whether a group of its experts reached the same conclusion about what would be an appropriate response in certain situations.AI researchers and public health advocates have long been wary of chatbots’propensity to affirm users’ decisionsor delusions regardless of whether they may be harmful, an issue known as sycophancy. Mental health experts havealso been concernedabout people using AI chatbots for psychological support and warned how it could harm vulnerable users.The language in OpenAI’s post distances the company from any potential causal links between its product and the mental health crises that its users are experiencing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

If the regulator is still unsatisfied, it will start the next phase of its investigation.However, Greencore and Bakkavor welcomed the decision, saying the regulator did not raise any competition concerns about 99% of the revenues of the combined group. The CMA in its ruling did not find a risk of market dominance in Italian chilled ready meals and own-label salads, leaving chilled sauces as the only area of concern.Dalton Philips, the chief executive of Greencore, said the CMA process had been “constructive” and that its phase 1 decision “is a welcome one”.“I am really grateful to my colleagues at Greencore and Bakkavor in successfully getting us to this point and we are now working with the CMA and Bakkavor for the benefit of all our stakeholders to complete the Bakkavor transaction early next year,” he said.Mike Edwards, the chief executive of Bakkavor, added the CMA’s decision provided “welcome clarity which means we can collectively work at pace and stay on track to complete the transaction in early 2026”.Analysts at the broker RBC Capital Markets said chilled sauces represent just 1% of the two companies’ combined revenues, as both manufacturers supply pasta sauces to large retailers in the UK.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That investigation made it harder for the company to win work. It bounced back initially, before the coronavirus pandemic added to its woes.Petrofac has been trying to restructure its finances for more than a year, and a formal plan was approved by the high court in May. It has debts of that may be approaching $4bn (£3bn), according to ajudgmentfrom July in a case brought by some creditors.But the company told investors on Thursday that the cancellation of a contract by TenneT, a European electricity grid operator and its biggest customer, meant that a solvent restructuring was no longer possible. The TenneT contract was to build offshore wind projects off the Dutch coast.The company said: “Having carefully assessed the impact of TenneT’s decision, the board has determined that the restructuring, which had last week reached an advanced stage, is no longer deliverable in its current form.”Administration will cast doubt over the future of parts of the business, particularly in the Middle East, which struggled particularly during the pandemic. However, it is thought that the UK arm has been performing relatively well, and could be of interest to external buyers.Labour promised in its general election manifesto not to grant licences for new oil and gas fields in the North Sea, and Miliband is consulting on legislation that will set out the government’s plans; a full timeline is yet to be announced. The issue has left the energy secretary grappling with the competing challenges of tackling the climate crisis, while also safeguarding jobs and energy security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Its market value at the time was about £20m.A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “The UK arm of Petrofac has not entered administration and is continuing to operate as normal, as an in-demand business with a highly skilled workforce and many successful contracts.“Petrofac’s administration is a product of longstanding issues in their global business.

The scope of the agreement covers passenger vehicles within EU markets and will contribute to Nissan’s commitment towards zero emissions in a sustainable way, while continuing to support the EU’s 2050 decarbonisation target.”It added that it had entered into the agreement to “ensure the business is better able to comply with EU regulations and continue the transition towards our own goal of zero emissions”.Chinese exports of EVs to the EU are already posing an existential crisis to the European car industry but are now, like Tesla, helping traditional car firms meet their decarbonisation targets courtesy of an EU regulation that in effect allows car firms to “pool” emissions.The EU has alreadyextended the period for compliancewith emissions rules from one year to three years, fuelling fears this will further delay the already slow take-up of EVs in the EU, particularly in southern Europe, but also in key states such as France and Germany.Fredrik Eklund, responsible for carbon credits trading at the Chinese-owned Swedish brand Polestar, which only makes electric vehicles, said: “It risks delaying the transition from legacy cars to EVs. We are already seeing car manufacturers pushing at the 2027 expiry date, but from our point of view and from the point of view of society, we really don’t want to delay this.”Under the rules, car manufacturers have to meet emissions targets of 93.6g of CO2per kilometre.But under the car pooling arrangement, car manufacturers can pay electric car companies to use their zero emissions record to average out the pollution from sales of their combustion engine cars to avoid fines.The industry in the past has said the 2025 emissions targets could have led to as much as €15bn (£13.03bn) in fines.The latest car pooling agreement, confirmed by Nissan, mirrors that of other companies who have teamed up with other big name electric car brands including Tesla and Polestar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It was the summer of 2000 and DeJohnette was in London to play with Keith Jarrett’s Standards Trio. Referring to him in my first question as a “drummer” felt reasonable enough, but DeJohnette didn’t appreciate being pigeonholed and shot back instantly: “I’m a complete musician.” A few days later, sitting in the Royal Festival Hall watching the Standards Trio, a moment of transcendent magic thrilled me as Jarrett sustained a long sequence of repeated notes high up on the piano and DeJohnette powered the music forwards with a labyrinthian drum solo as harmonically searching as anything Jarrett had played. Complete musician indeed.“The idea of improvisation,” DeJohnette told me, “is tied up in the very nature of our existence. We don’t expect our life to evolve without changing and we never know what’s round the corner – why should music be any different?” He further explained that each part of his drum kit he considered to be a musical being “in its own right”. He designed and tuned his cymbals to his own specification. Mix the sound of cymbals with the drums and then “you think harmonically on the kit,” he added. The sounds inside DeJohnette’s head could never be contained by the conventions of drum technique. He was also a pianist of considerable merit – who released a solo piano album, Return, in 2016 – and every facet of his musicianship seemed to be on display all of the time, untilhis death this week aged 83.View image in fullscreenJack DeJohnette.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsMany drummers tune their kit to a bespoke design, but DeJohnette’s playing exhibited a life-force that was entirely his own. To hear him play on What I Say from Miles Davis’s album Live-Evil is to marvel at apparently superhuman drive as he maintained an impactful funk/rock beat for 20 minutes. DeJohnette, who also played on Davis’s epoch-defining Bitches Brew, had by 1970 become the trumpeter’s drummer of choice in a meeting of mighty musical minds. His drums rooted What I Say deep in the Earth and allowed Davis, and subsequently saxophonist Gary Bartz, all the space they needed to explore, while DeJohnette packed his playing with rattling rhythmic asides – keeping a continual discussion with the other musicians.His own 1968 debut album, The DeJohnette Complex, immediately proposed that his was a voice intimately connected with a jazz scene exploding in a thousand directions around him, while he remained doggedly independent. The compositions DeJohnette wrote for his album were harmonically ornate and asserted jazz/rock energy while also occasionally leaning towards free-form improvisation. He featured himself playing melodica, and his folky melodic inventions soared.The DeJohnette Complex demonstrated that DeJohnette’s aesthetic was indeed delightfully complex and, after leaving Davis, he was signed to ECM Records. In 1976 he releasedUntitled, a hectic quintet album, but also Pictures in which he played piano, drums and organ, and duetted on some tracks with guitarist John Abercrombie, an album that was sparse and bare-bones in contrast to Untitled.His 1981 ECM album with saxophonist John Surman, The Amazing Adventures of Simon Simon, became a landmark moment for both musicians, and a much-loved classic too. Surman and DeJohnette played their usual instruments while also doubling on keyboards and synthesisers, subsuming their own identities inside lavishly orchestrated soundscapes of pastoral tones. Another essential album was Oneness, recorded in 1997, which dealt up large-scale structures with pieces such as Free Above Sea and Priestesses of the Mist, their titles mirroring the elemental force unleashed by the music. Listening to that album around the time of its release, I was reminded of an earlier encounter with DeJohnette, when I heard his group Special Edition play in Leeds during the late 1980s. This performance was in no hurry to stake out its terrain, as ambient, slow-burn forms gradually telescoped towards rhythmic blows.‘Jazz isn’t about perfection’: drummer Billy Cobham on Miles Davis, Massive Attack and still learning at 80Read moreTalking to DeJohnette all those years later, these ideas of stress-testing form and scale made more sense. He told me how he loved playing those funk figurations with Davis because “I could sit in grooves and let them saturate me”, but also spoke of his desire to generate more wide-angled musical soundscapes, always open-ended and therefore healthy for the brain. He complained about the “safe confines” of pop music with its repetitive patterns. “With improvisation, though,” he said, “you’re open to a full range of possibilities. People are capable of being very creative but only seem to tap into their potential when there is a major earthquake or something. But if people were more conscious of our place within nature, stopped abusing the Earth and put things back into it, we would have a healthier environment and society.”No question that DeJohnette heard his music as modelling those idealist aspirations. “Art is the spiritual equivalent of that purification, which is passed to us as energy – and all artists have to draw on that.”Explore more on these topicsJazzMiles DaviscommentShareReuse this content"

As 12-year-old Alex-Li Tandem gets Big Daddy’s autograph (the start of an obsession), his own daddy drops dead from a brain tumour. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel doesn’t quite live up to the prologue. The critical heavyweights of the time didn’t pull their punches:“A poky, pallid successor” (Michiko Kakutani, who hadrapturously reviewedWhite Teeth, in the New York Times), “cartoonish” and full of“misplaced ironies and grinning complicities”(James Wood in the LRB). Others were more generous. Whatever. Smith was just getting stuff out the way.View image in fullscreen7The Wife of Willesden (2021)Given Smith’s talent for dialogue, it was only a matter of time before she wrote a play. Her first, and only, work for the stage is a riotous reworking of The Wife of Bath’s Tale from Canterbury Tales, transported to an open-mic night at a pub on the Kilburn High Road. Chaucer’s Alyson becomes Alvita, a five-times married Jamaican-born British woman in her mid-50s. Her voice, “brash, honest, cheeky, salacious, outrageous, unapologetic is one I’ve heard and loved all my life”, Smith writes in the introduction. “She’s been that bitch since 1983,” the audience is told. First performed at Kilburn’s Kiln theatre, it transferred to the National in London (you can still watch it on theirwebsite) and to New York. Bawdy and brave, here is a woman speaking her truth down the centuries.View image in fullscreen6The Fraud (2023)Smith’s first foray into historical fiction is based on the Tichborne trial of 1873, when an East End-born butcher living in Australia claimed to be the long-lost heir to a fortune. She found the story on herdoorstep: the scamster is buried in an unmarked grave in Willesden, where the novel, like nearly all Smith’s fiction, is set. With its dangerous populist hero, peddling conspiracy theories and fake news, this Victorian drama has plenty of contemporary resonances. The writing is as smart and assured as ever. Many criticsloved it. But, perhaps because it rests on plot (never Smith’s strongest point) rather than character, for me the novel lacks the flesh-and-blood vitality of her earlier fiction. We read Smith to show us how we live now.5Swing Time (2016)“I wanted to express how it is to be in the world as a black woman,” Smithsaidof her more sombre fifth novel. In 1982, two little girls from neighbouring estates meet at a dance class in a Willesden church hall. Reinvention, celebrity, motherhood and – ahead of its time – cultural appropriation are all touched upon in a novel that zigzags deftly through time and place. Smith is at her sharpest on the subtle codes of class and race. From Barbies and the Argos catalogue to goths and MTV, she captures growing up in the 80s and 90s, to a soundtrack of Michael Jackson and Rakim. If the social commentary becomes a little heavy-footed at times, the central story of female friendship, in all its jealousies, rivalries and betrayals, never falters.View image in fullscreen4NW (2012)Childhood loyalties and the conflicting yearnings for freedom and belonging are also at the heart of Smith’s most experimental novel. It is fair to say that critical opinion was divided: “clunky”, “weirdly contrived”, with “paper doll characters”, snipedKakutaniagain;“a joyous, optimistic, angry masterpiece”, “her best”, cried others. Set in north-west London – obviously – NW covers familiar Smith territory, but with the spirit of Woolf rather than Dickens on her shoulder. The optimism of her early fiction has been replaced by “existential bleakness”, in Smith’s words. If you read novels to know what thingsfeellike, what the author calls“the concrete ‘thingyness’ of people”, rather than for what happens, you will sink into the thirtysomething lives of Leah and Natalie against the Kilburn summer of 2010. If not, move on. Magnificent in parts; infuriating as a whole.View image in fullscreen3Feel Free: Essays (2018)In the UK we are suspicious of the essay form – too intellectually showy, perhaps – whereas in the US it is a badge of distinction; all the cool writers are at it. Thank goodness, then, for Smith, who has emerged as one of our liveliest thinkers as well as storytellers. The subjects in thiscollectionrange from Justin Bieber to Brexit, Jay-Z to Hanif Kureishi, Joni Mitchell to Schopenhauer, the climate emergency, her childhood bathroom, and joy, all corralled by a formidable intellect and wit. Here is Smith thinking on the page about the things that matter most to her (books, music, film, injustice, freedoms of one kind or another). Be warned: reading Smith’s essays will make you realise you have floated through life with the critical acuity of an amoeba. But you will emerge better for it. And she is always great company. A new collection,Dead and Alive, is out this month.2White Teeth (2000)“White Teeth is the literary equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing 10-year-old,” Smith herself, then anonymously and now famously, opined in the small literary magazine Butterfly. Everyone else was busy comparing her to Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi and even Dickens. This noisy, sunny story of two second world war veterans, best friends Archie Jones from Reading and Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim, and their extended families, who have fetched up in Willesden, turned out to be the novel everyone was waiting for. Smith arrived with a voice that was at once funny, fearless, philosophical and hip, and which was perfectly suited to the hopefulness of a new millennium: publishing’s answer to Cool Britannia. While the plot is slightly preposterous, the author was clearly preposterously talented. Twenty-five years later, White Teeth remains a landmark of British fiction.View image in fullscreen1On Beauty (2005)“One may as well begin with Jerome’s emails to his father,” begins Smith’s third novel, to signal that what follows is a reworking of EM Forster’s classic Howards End. What chutzpah! Two families, the liberal Belseys and the establishment Kippses (Forster’s Schlegels and Wilcoxes), from New England and Kilburn respectively, become fatefully intertwined. Art, faith, rap, race, pain and death are all wrapped up in a comic campus novel and bravura literary homage. On Beauty is the only Smith novel to have been shortlisted for the Booker prize (howisthat?); it won the Orange, now Women’s prize. Martin Amis said he read everything by Smith “with a constant smile of admiration”; this book makes your face ache. Much is made of the precocity of White Teeth. Smith was only 30 (the same age as Forster) when she pulled off this erudite, expansive and affecting novel. The author turns 50 this month.

Among many other elements, fretting about invisibility seems to be a recently acquired national trait. Virtually every group featured here, from the LGBTQ+ crowd, to uprooted Syrian refugees to local fishers and diehard Brexiters, complains of being overlooked, neglected or misunderstood in some way.Director Jessi Gutch shadows seven Folkestonians, the better to map the faultlines in the national psyche: Syrian exile Heba, not quite as fully integrated into UK culture as her younger brother and sister; barber and Only Fools and Horses proselytiser Nathan, who holds a torch for the British working class; black artist Josie, whose work explores the relationship between land and identity; Dan, the son of a fisher who as drag performer Dita advocates for gay rights; fishers Alan and John, now forced for lack of catch to chaperone cross-Channel swimmers; and gnomic Brexiter Neil, who says, “We live on an island and we’re allowed to have a mentality. Whether that’s an island mentality, I don’t know.”Gutch hopes for a United Kingdom able to embrace the “other”, and finds Brexitland to not yet be a lost cause. Nathan finds unlikely converts to the cult of Del Boy in a pair of Serbian tourists. Dan’s father, clearly rattled when he first found out about his son’s sexuality, attends one of his drag shows. Even Neil is doing outreach work with Iraqi asylum seekers. Gutch recognises her own prejudices, admitting that she had initially forgotten to include the fishers – but this candour underlines a lack of curiosity about “traditional” England – which comes out sometimes as condescension, as in a cheap dig about Neil’s manner of preferred breakfast eggs. It’s this that hems the film into liberal platitudes, rather than delving into a deeper understanding of the issues.One thing Gutch does very well though, is film the grey veil of the Channel; a mysterious and imposing threshold between Britain and elsewhere and, for too many migrants, between life and death. Envisaging the division is one thing – but bridging it feels like too much to ask for in a narratively overneat final tea party where the interviewees break bread.Blue Has No Borders is at thePalace Cinema Broadstairson 27 October,then touring.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsMigrationBrexitEuropean UnionEuropeForeign policyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Luckily, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory has plenty of that and a lot more besides. I don’t care if you’ve just received a terminal diagnosis or found out your wife’s been having an affair with Chris Martin, you stick this film on and you’ll smile.‘Stole my heart’: why My Best Friend’s Wedding is my feelgood movieRead moreThe last time I watched it, before rewatching for this article, was with my wife and infant son in the week after his birth. He was too busy crapping himself to understand what was going on so the film was obviously just for us. Why would two thirtysomethings choose to watch a children’s film from the 1970s? Perhaps we were nostalgic for our own lost childhoods of watching it every Christmas and bank holiday, perhaps we were excited for the near future of a new childhood, or perhaps because this is a film where a man eats a microphone instead of answering a reporter’s question. No hands. Just eats it and goes back to his meal like it was nothing. Silly, odd and utterly joyous. And the silliest, oddest and most joyous thing of all is Wonka himself.No one has ever been better cast thanGene Wilderas Willy Wonka. And yet it almost didn’t happen. Wilder told the director that he would only take the part if he let him introduce the character as having a limp in the now iconic scene where Wonka emerges from his factory. It was a complete deal-breaker. An incredulous Mel Stuart, the director, asked him why the hell he wanted to do that, to which Wilder replied: because “from that point on, no one will know whether I’m telling the truth or lying.” The level of thought, dedication and detail Wilder obviously put into his performance shines through in every scene and makes you believe that this strange man really exists somewhere and can perform miracles. The Pure Imagination song/scene where he shows the children the factory for the first time is a case in point. Look (not very) closely and you can see how ropey the set and props really are but Wilder conjures magic, turning the polystyrene mushrooms into an edible wonderland. There’s no suspending of disbelief, you just believe.Wilder’s Wonka is an excitable, irascible, funny, odd, unpredictable and philosophical creation with a penchant for quoting poetry and Shakespeare. I’m sorry, Chalamet, but no one will ever better it. No one will ever again be sampled by Aphex Twin into the hit song We Are the Music Makers. Wilder is Wonka, Wonka is Wilder.Beyond the inspirational genius and deeper meanings, the film is also just very funny. It has a bone-dry, almost macabre, sense of humour and tone that you nearly forget until you watch it again. From Charlie’s schoolteacher screaming “class dismissed” immediately on hearing about the Golden Ticket competition, to Veruca Salt and her father’s interplay, Charlie complaining of yet another dinner of “cabbage water” and Wonka seemingly completely indifferent to the mortal danger he’s put the other children in, it makes you laugh. Laugh like you did before you got old. Even the dreaded boat scene has the same brio and unbridled zest for life that runs throughout. This is a world we should aspire to live in, where the colours are brighter and the chocolate sweeter.Watching Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is like stepping through a door back into childhood, not just for nostalgic reasons but because it reminds you that anything is possible with a little imagination. As adults we are often prisoners of our own lack of imagination and the idea of playing around or being silly is too quickly dismissed. But what is life really about if not to imagine and be as silly as possible whenever you get the chance because the truth is your chances are running out. As Wonka himself says “a little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men”.Decades after the film came out, Wilder was speaking about what it still means to people. He said: “Every four and a half years I get a new generation [of children] and I see when I’m walking down the street, their eyes light up, they saw Willy Wonka! It’s funny, it’s good.” Like when he finally hugs Charlie at the end of the film, if that doesn’t make you feel good, nothing will.Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is available on HBO Max in the US and to rent digitally in the UK and AustraliaExplore more on these topicsGene WilderMy feelgood movieRoald DahlAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ortega returns to his home town in a remote forested region on the border withArgentina, on a mission to investigate a local legend that a man called Canuto, from his grandfather’s generation, was transformed into a jaguar.The film is at once a documentary on this subject and a record of the fictional re-enactment that Ortega is staging using local people – and, in a way, it is a film about itself. He speaks to his aged grandfather and to villagers about their customs and beliefs and their fraught relationship with the military tyranny of the time; it wasa period notorious for thedesaparecidos– the “disappeared”– which provides an enigmatic political context for Canuto’s vanishing and the authorities who appropriated their lands without compensation. There are also sharp comments on a certain high-handed “white architect” who designed an award-winning wooden community centre for them, which the community itself regards as exasperatingly flimsy and unfit for purpose, and which they plan to break up for lumber.The film works in a kind of real-time immersive way, showing scenes in the community at unbroken length . So: does anyone appearing on camera fully believe that Canuto was transformed into a jaguar? Or is the whole idea mysticalised and relativised to such an extent that we question our assumptions about every aspect of asking that question? It could be that Canuto met a horrible end, political or otherwise, and the “jaguar” myth was devised by the collective hivemind to process their shock and grief. It’s an intriguing study.Canuto’s Transformation is on True Story from 31 October.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsIndigenous peoplesBrazilArgentinaAmericasreviewsShareReuse this content"

Standard critical guidance applies: what will doubtless be catnip for fans is likely to prove varyingly baffling for newcomers, arriving late to a frenetic game offering few chances for catchup. The latter camp might, however, cling to the Halloween-adjacent release date as a partial decryption device: Fujimoto’s teenage hero Denji (voiced by Kikunosuke Toya) has a chainsaw-wielding demon squatting in his soul, suggesting the twin influences of Tobe Hooper and Shinya Tsukamoto.The fallout from this will be, to coin a phrase, exaggerated – but the underlying emotions remain legible, maybe even relatable. Dopey slacker Denji is torn between two romantic prospects: notionally nice girl Makita, who appeals to his cultured side, and freckled, jade-eyed waitress Reze, who invites our boy to break into school after hours to skinny-dip. She’s a gal to elevate his heart rate; pity she’s also hellbent on ripping Denji’s heart out.The film’s artistry is undeniable: director Tatsuya Yoshihara and team sketch ultra-photorealistic urban environments, making it only more striking when Reze pulls a grenade-pin from her neck, exploding her earthly form, and when a possessed Denji, bearing chainsaws for arms, launches a counterattack atop his shark familiar.Before a final descent into exhausting city trashing, its gleeful perversity is semi-interesting: what the success of these titles tells us is that there’s an audience whose desires aren’t currently being met by Hollywood pencil-pushers. Man, is it male-oriented, though. From Denji’s frilly pink fantasies to the fact Reze becomes more pornographic in appearance the more demonic she gets, Yoshihara is not shy about courting those who might have felt uniquely wronged by the opposite sex. “What a rush!” Denji squawks, in one such incel-friendly indelicacy. “I just cut off a beautiful woman’s leg.”Chainsaw Man: The Movie – Reze Arc is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeMangaScience fiction and fantasy filmsJapanComics and graphic novelsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Back then, his debut album Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby went multiple-platinum, he was seen as the new Prince and told the world he was a genius. However, D’Arby’s career plummeted after the critical savaging of his more experimental second album and in 2001 he changed his name to “create a new identity that wasn’t traumatised by the ‘fall from grace’.” He walks on for his first UK tour in almost a quarter of a century to a hero’s welcome.

The fledgling rapper had been getting into trouble at his school in London so, in a bid to rectify this, they packed him off to boarding school in Enugu inNigeria. “Some people out there just didn’t understand me,” says Knucks, as we talk at his record label’s office. “Like, in Britain people are saying, ‘Go home.’ But people in Nigeria were like, ‘You don’t belong here either.’”Boarding school proved to be a challenging couple of years for Knucks, whose real name is Afamefuna Ashley Nwachukwu. He swiftly picked up a handful of “nemeses”, including the most popular boy in the year, who threatened him on his first day and warned him to stay away from his girlfriend. Miles from the place he called home, and without amenities such as a washing machine, Knucks found solace in a friendship with the school cook. “She was my mother figure,” he says. “If I was sad or homesick, I would go to her.”When I returned from Nigeria the temperature had changed. Everyone was talking about Giggs and Talkin’ da HardestTales from Knucks’s two years in Nigeria feed into his new album, A Fine African Man, which finds the 30-year-old reflecting on “where I stand in the world, what kind of person I am, how my values are influenced by things that happened back then”. On the song Cut Knuckles, he compares the luxuries of his current life (“Now I’m watchin’ the brand new stuff that I got gettin’ tumble dried”) with memories of having to handwash his clothes in Enugu (“No washing machine / Man wasn’t a teen / But was washin’ my clothes by hand / Cut knuckles, the water stang”).Knucks has spent the past decade taking his narrative-driven, conscious lyricism to the very top of British rap. When his breakthrough single,21 Candles, was released on SoundCloud in 2015, his musings on the impermanence of friendships marked him out as relatable and introspective, vulnerable even. You can hear those qualities again on new track Are You Okay?, which contemplates the limits of fame and money; and on Three Musketeers from his 2022 debut album Alpha Place, which is about his experience of survivor guilt, and on which he reflects on being the only one of his trio of closest friends to have escaped the daily battles and tensions of his Kilburn housing estate. Alpha Place racked up millions of streams and earned the Mobo award foralbum of the year, in a win shared with Little Simz (for herSometimes I Might Be Introvert).Knucks tells me it was during the summer before secondary school that he first got into making music with friends from his estate. When he got to secondary school there was a recording studio, so “during lunchbreaks, me and seven friends went and recorded eight-bar after eight-bar”. Grime was the obsession of the schoolyard before he was sent to Nigeria, but when he returned in 2008, “the temperature had changed”. Road rap was in: “Everyone was talking about Giggs. Talkin’ da Hardest had just come out.”View image in fullscreen‘At lunch we recorded eight-bar after eight-bar’ … Knucks.Knucks was using soul samples and “high-pitched female vocals”, rather than the electronic production of grime, and as he absorbed classic albums by Nas and MF Doom, his transition towards hip-hop continued. Nas’s Illmatic was particularly foundational to shaping his own music, even inspiring the name of Knucks’s first mixtape, Killmatic. “The rawness, the lyricism, the stories, how hungry Nas was: I saw a lot of that in myself.”It wasn’t only the musical landscape that was changed when Knucks returned from Nigeria. In northwest London, he had been surrounded by diverse communities, but by the time of his return to the UK, his family had relocated to Watford in Hertfordshire, where he attended a “very white” school. Before, Knucks had been known as Afamefuna or Afam. Now he felt humiliated whenever his name was butchered in assemblies. When the headmaster suggested he go by his middle name, Ashley, he “jumped at it”.Does he regret dropping his Nigerian name? Yes and no. It was an adaptation strategy, he says. Plus everyone just calls him Knucks now anyway (a shortening of his nickname “Knuckles”, which came from a playground game and hisfavourite Sonic character). Still, he also felt some shame about it, he says, something he documents on new track My Name Is My Name, and across the album in general. (A Fine African Man is, after all, an acrostic of Afam.)View image in fullscreen‘No washing machine / Man wasn’t a teen / But was washin’ my clothes by hand’ … Knucks.Knucks has traversed drill, soul, jazz infusions and classic boom-bap hip-hop over his career – and now he’s tapping into West African cadences. Nigerian influences suffuse the album. When he visited in 2023, he stood at the bus stop by his old boarding school and recorded the conductors, eventually incorporating these field recordings into the tracks. On Masquerade there’s the use of an ogene, a cowbell-like instrument used during masquerades in Igboland, and the ojà flute, which you may recognise from Nigerian singer Kcee’samapiano hit Ojapiano. “I’m making an effort to put these instruments in there so people from home can relate to it on a deeper level,” says Knucks.With his parents having been strict enough to send him to boarding school in Nigeria, I wonder how they responded to his rap aspirations. Knucks says they were actually warm to the idea, but also insisted he go to university. (He graduated from UCA Rochester with a degree in animation and computer graphics). They also had confidence in his manager and mentor, Nathan “NRG” Rodney. Before he died in a car crash in 2018, Rodney had become one of the great influences in Knucks’s life, helping him course-correct whenever egotistic or selfish instincts took him in wayward directions. Knucks’s voice shakes when talking about NRG’s death: “It put me in a rut, because I had mad love for him. He was like an older brother.”You can sense Rodney’s guidance in A Fine African Man’s blossoming maturity. Four years ago, when Knucks’s father was transferring money to friends and relatives in Nigeria, the rapper asked if he could add some for someone else he considered family: the cook who had looked after him at boarding school. She had become bedbound and unable to work, and when the money reached her she was apparently moved to find she had made such an impression on Knucks. Her story is retold on the album’s track Yam Porridge, which includes intimate memories of her own late father.“I made the effort to tell the story from her perspective,” says Knucks, “and to leave myself out until the end.”A Fine African Man is released on 31 October on NoDaysOffExplore more on these topicsHip-hopRapNigeriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

There he is – in shows such as Parts Unknown and No Reservations – a gonzo gourmand trekking to backstreet nooks and favela hideouts in parts of the world where celebrity chefs fear to tread. In Beirut and Congo; savouring calamari and checking out graffiti in Tripoli; slurping rice noodles and necking bottles of cold beer with Barack Obama in Hanoi, Vietnam. One course follows another, evenings drift past midnight and he’s still chewing the fat with locals, hungry for stories – about drugs, dissidence, gristly local politics.But Bourdain, who killed himself aged just 61 in 2018, had always seen himself as a writer. His mother was an editor at the New York Times, and his youthful crushes were mostly beatniks and outlaws – Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Lester Bangs, Hunter S Thompson. (Orwell too – especially his account of a dishwasher’s life in Down and Out in Paris and London.) A college dropout, he later signed up for a writing workshop with famed editor Gordon Lish. His earliest bylines appeared in arty, downtown publications; two crime novels (Bone in the Throat, Gone Bamboo) got decent reviews but sold poorly.Things turned around after the publication in 2000 of his bestselling memoir Kitchen Confidential. It portrayed New York’s restaurants as sweatshops, military trenches, last chance saloons for a whole bevy of social misfits. For Bourdain they were refuges. A teenager who’d been into Abbie Hoffman and Eldridge Cleaver, he later became a heroin addict, a fan of the Ramones and the Voidoids, a dive bar denizen. Week by week the city was getting Bloomberged, mom’n’pop stores giving way to salad bars and frozen-yoghurt parlours: with its swaggering, screw-faced evocation of a rawer, less pasteurised New York, his was a book of mourning as much as it was one of celebration.By 2011 HarperCollins had given Bourdain his own publishing imprint. By 2016 The New Yorker was describing him as “not actually a star … a nebula”. Now his agent Kimberly Witherspoon has compiled The Anthony Bourdain Reader, drawn not only from his best-known books, but also handwritten short stories, chapters from unfinished novels, something he calls “Another Pointless Journalistic Play” and ghost-themed comics featuring Japanese spirits with a fondness for preying on balls of flesh located inside human anuses. There’s even a travel diary entry from 1973: “My stomach and intestines hurt. I have contributed more shit and more vomit to the Florence sewer system than I did at home in a year.”This head-to-tail editorial approach won’t be to everyone’s taste. Bourdain’s fictional writing lacks the urgency and gamey flavour of his journalistic dispatches. “Good food, good eating, is all about blood, organs, cruelty and decay,” he once wrote, and some of the most memorable passages involve noshing on a braised bat (“imagine braised inner tube, sauced with engine coolant”), sampling the still-beating heart of a cobra (“like chewing on a rubber dog toy”), watching farm workers plunge a knife into a pig’s thorax (“the screaming penetrated the fillings in my teeth, echoed through the valley”). Is this the “food and travel porn” that at one stage he fears he may be guilty of producing?At his worst, Bourdain’s carnivorousness and his screeds against vegans, Peta supporters or anyone campaigning against toxic chemicals read like libertarian shtick, manna for Top Gear stans. Complaining that people can no longer smoke in bars, he huffs, “it’s only a matter of time before some well-intentioned health Nazi busts into your bedroom and yanks that post-intercourse cigarette right outta your hand”. Then again, Christopher Hitchens might applaud his anti-Kissinger diatribe: “While Henry continues to nibble nori rolls and remake at A-list parties, Cambodia, the neutral nation he secretly and illegally bombed, invaded, undermined, and then threw to the dogs, is still trying to raise itself up on its one remaining leg.”Some of the loveliest passages come when Bourdain writes with just-so tenderness and precision about his family: a journey with his brother to La Teste-de-Buch in France among whose sand dunes they holidayed as young men; the outsize pleasure he takes in his five-year-old daughter nibbling on Pecorino and an anchovy. I suspect Bourdain will be read in years to come less as a writer about food than of food work. Everywhere he lands – whether in struggling bistros, mob joints or midtown nightclubs – he warms to the subaltern caste of underpaid toilers slicing and sizzling and sweating away.One of them, a century ago, was Irish-born Mary Mallon, later demonised as Typhoid Mary. In his passionate defence of her, he talks about what it’s like to grow old as a cook. The pains in the back, the knees. Perhaps the heart. “Where once you would have turned your head to cough, you turn no longer. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom? Maybe … Unwashed hands, an errant cigarette ash, a roasted chicken dropped on a dirty kitchen floor and retrieved on the bounce … We’ve been there, you and me and Mary.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Chris Kraus uses the phrase a lot, making it wilfully jaded in its repetitions. “He could make a fresh start.” “They decided to make a fresh start.” And all along, here she is, making her own fresh start, because this seems a new kind of book – documentarian, genuinely novelistic. But then it turns out to be packed with the same dilemmas and styles as the old ones.Kraus is an artist who became a writer almost accidentally with her 1997 cult classicI Love Dick, comprised of letters to an unreceptive lover, turning confessional female writing from abjection into assassination. She carried on writing, but the three subsequent fascinating and rebarbative novels lacked the shock and immediacy the letter form brought to the voice of I Love Dick. It didn’t help that she was a renegade artist who’d become a large-scale low-rent landlord, so there was a lot about real estate deals. It makes sense that she now wants to try out new kinds of material, looking outwards to other people’s stories, at a time when she says Trumpian politics makes confessional writing redundant.The Four Spent the Day Together is in three parts, straddling three generations – all unable to escape their pasts. There’s the story of Emma and Jasper, versions of Kraus’s parents, moving from the Bronx to rural Connecticut. There’s the story of Kraus herself, in the persona of Catt Greene, reckoning with the belated success of I Love Dick, the rise of Trump, and her addict husband Paul. And there’s the story of the murder of one lost young man by another in a town long abandoned by progressive politics only 80 miles from Catt’s cottage in rural Minnesota.As a reader drawn to honed writing of the kind Kraus herself tends to eschew, I was seduced by the novelistic voice of the first sectionAs a reader drawn to honed writing of the kind Kraus herself tends to eschew, I was seduced by the novelistic voice of the first section. There’s a new quality of attentiveness that makes room for minutiae, like the bucket that the young Catt dislodges from ice at the opening of the book, aided by her beloved father. “I found an ice toy!” she says; “a nice toy”, he responds, “the elliptical meanings of words rolling around in their mouths like hard candy”. Kraus writes Emma’s story with curiosity and intimacy. “Emma felt like she’d stepped into a dream – not hers, exactly.”I was destined to be disappointed when I hoped this new voice could last out the book. Kraus says here that she resents the pleasure readers like me have taken from I Love Dick; she’s committed to disjunction, to the untidy aesthetics she shares with her hero Kathy Acker, and the blankness and repetitiveness of her previous novels reasserts itself in the middle section. Catt is attempting to do up 36 run-down apartments in Albuquerque’s worst neighbourhoods while moving between Minnesota and LA, failing to help Paul control his drinking. She feels helpless as Paul moves between underfunded jobs as an addiction therapist in a world driven by the anger and fear that powers Trump’s victory. There are several pages about Catt being cancelled on Twitter, her occupation changed from “writer” to “landlord” on Wikipedia. Kraus still seems to care a little too much about this. At one point she says she’s investigating the murder so that before leaving Minnesota, “she might be able to learn something about an America that her Twitter detractors would not understand, would not even see”.So then we come to the murder itself – and the titular day spent by the victim with the murderer and his friends. Kraus has great source material, and knows hour by hour what happened when Brandon came to visit Brittney after meeting her on an app where she sold sex pictures. He was hoping for sex but seems affably to have spent the day alongside her friends, mooching around getting his car mended and paying for snacks and drugs, before being shot by Brittney’s boyfriend Micah – a young, mentally ill man who has frequently been hospitalised for violent rage.Catt gets obsessed by the story, and I was fascinated by the way that Kraus’s dual urges towards responsible documentation and reckless transgression tussle in this section.But I’d have liked her to go further into her own obsessions here. The most interesting character is Brittney, who comes alive partly through Catt’s identification with her – another bright, bullied girl going off the rails in a troubled, forgotten town. Kraus tells us that Catt speaks to Brittney in jail, but she doesn’t dramatise these conversations. The whole section feels oddly unfinished, to the extent that Kraus’s narration ends almost mid-paragraph, and we’re left with 30 pages of the source material. We’re back where Kraus began, with letters – though these now take the forms of misspelt text messages. We’re in a world where desperation is monotonous and ugly and seems destined to remain so; where fresh starts are impossible, which may be what she wanted us to see all along.The Four Spent the Day Together by Chris Kraus is published by Scribe (£16.99).

The Séance of Blake Manor sounds like the stuff of cosy Sunday evening entertainment. Thankfully, this folk-horror drama has much more to offer than a bit of fun for Agatha Christie fans.It’s October 1897, and you play as private investigator Declan Ward, sent to the aforementioned manor – now a grand hotel – to discover the whereabouts of one of its guests, Evelyn Deane, who has gone missing in mysterious circumstances. What you discover is a gothic mansion filled with eccentrics: from a psychic researcher wielding a spirit camera to a vodouist oungan and a Brazilian woman tracing her family roots. They are here to attend a grand seance that will take place on All Hallow’s Eve, when the phantasmagoric barrier between the worlds of the living and the dead is at its thinnest. But as you discover while you wander the ornate rooms and meticulously planned gardens via first-person viewpoint, each participant has a secret – some deadly, some tragic – and many know more about young Miss Deane than they’re letting on.View image in fullscreenAbsolutely gripping … The Séance of Blake Manor.Photograph: Spooky Doorway/Raw FuryWhat follows is, in some ways, an archetypal detective adventure, told in the visual style of a graphic novel, the art heavily inspired by the works of Mike Mignola (Hellboy) and Eduardo Risso (100 Bullets). You talk to suspects and witnesses, explore rooms for hidden clues and useful items, and slowly draw up a list of culprits. All the while, the game has an internal clock and a timetable of events that your investigations must fit into. The clock only ticks forward if you’re actively searching a location or interrogating a guest, so you must make efficient use of your detective skills, and you always need to make sure you’re in the right place at the right time to eavesdrop on clandestine meetings, or to catch useful talks on spiritualism, mythology and the history of the manor that take place in the grand drawing room.All your findings can be examined and connected via a series of graphical inventory screens, which include an evolving mind map of clues and actions. It can be overwhelming to begin with, all these systems suddenly booting into life with every letter, key and clue you discover, but you gradually get the hang of things and realise that making your own notes is a must. While it’s not as structurally innovative asBlue Prince, the game has interesting ways of prompting you in certain directions, including a word game deduction system that gets you to create hypotheses of motives and backstories with which to confront suspects.As your investigation unfolds, you begin to understand that this isn’t simply a cosy little period adventure. It is a game with a point to make. The mansion has been built on top of a site of ancient historical and religious importance, transforming it into a colonialist symbol, while the wealth of the visitors is contrasted with the poverty of the hotel’s staff in subtle and meaningful ways. This is a game about appropriation and sociocultural destruction as much as it is about one character disappearing, and as we learn about folklore and paganism, we also come to understand what the manor and its rich owners – the troubled Blake family – really represent. Woven into this is the theme of diaspora, with several guests arriving from colonised countries, seeking the answers to complex family mysteries. Here too are tales of drug addiction, abuse and grief, all carefully woven into the central narrative. There are also some genuinely spine-tingling moments as apparitions appear at the edges of your vision and things go bump in the night.The result is an absolutely gripping detective tale and a beautifully researched work of interactive folk horror to stand alongside the recent Strange Antiquities and Wadjet Eye’s seminal The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow. It completely immerses you in its world of clashing cultures and supernatural revenge, managing to explore complex themes of colonial trauma, religion and identity within the confines of a single location and event. It will have you rushing to the bookshop or library to read more about spiritualism, folklore and ancient Irish history.Sure, The Séance of Blake Manor is an autumnal treat filled with spooky scenes but it is also that most joyous of discoveries: a game that challenges, delights, thrills and educates in equal measure.The Séance of Blake Manor is out now, £16.75Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

Playwright John Morton and director Jimmy Fay wring maximum dark humour from this dystopian two-hander, set in 2048 at the end of days. As Liam (Patrick O’Kane) and Edel (Anna Healy) are bunkered in a remote cottage on a mountainside, gradually being engulfed by smoke and fire, they have no idea how many more hours they have left before everything is obliterated.In the high stakes of this drama, the focus is not on possible causes of the global catastrophe, but on bringing this long-married couple to crisis point as their time is running out. What plays out, bleakly, are the different ways each character attempts to reach some kind of reckoning with their lives: through drugs and alcohol, manic boogieing or tentative prayer. While Edel tries to contact their adult children and friends, to stay in touch with the outside world on patchy phone connections, the conversations and media bulletins all bring news of death and horror.Ingeniously designed by Maree Kearns (set) and Chris Warner (sound) as a graveyard for obsolete technology, their barricaded cottage is dominated by looping digital time signals, flashing numbers and ancient video screens. As Liam hammers out his memoirs in “hard prose” on a manual typewriter, his persistence seems driven by a churning sense of guilt; he is writing a confession. “Everything is your fault”, he mutters, blaming himself, for reasons hinted at and later spelled out unnecessarily.His hands never far from his shotgun, Liam initially seems the more volatile of the pair, but Edel has her own recklessly destructive impulses. In O’Kane and Healy’s riveting, emotionally nuanced performances, their confrontations escalate dangerously. With or without the apocalyptic premise, the intensity of their portrait of a marriage burns through.Until 15 November at Lyric, Belfast, as part ofBelfast international arts festival, which runs until 9 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

There are signs here of a playwright stretching her imagination and intellectual inquiries in audacious, engaging ways.And it half works. Longlisted for theWomen’s prize for playwriting, the play begins as a romance between two flat-earthers, Honey (Fanta Barrie) and Christopher (Ross O’Donnellan), and opens up into an endeavour narrative. We see them travel to the empty vastness of the Antarctic to find an apparent barrier which marks the end of the world – in order to prove the Earth is flat.They meet soon after Honey’s sister has died of cancer. Christopher is carrying his own trauma after a divorce that has left him estranged from his daughter. Both are vulnerable, disenchanted and tussling with questions around meaning and truth.The play shuttles back and forth in time, from their first meeting to a treacherous fall into a ravine. For a while it looks like it will enterTouching the Voidterritory. Cat Fuller’s original set of icy shards and Jamie Lu’s sound design of arctic winds bring good atmosphere. It turns, organically, into a play about conspiracy theory, the distrust of “official” facts and the rise of misinformation. The nature of truth is at the heart of Honey and Christopher’s endeavour. Covid conspiracies are mentioned, as well as the Iraq war andErin Brockovich, while the moon landings are designated “fake.” It very much reflects the anxieties of our present moment, carrying shades of a film likeBugonia.Under the direction of Imy Wyatt Corner, there is pace and jeopardy but that stalls when the play turns more absurdist, with a talking penguin and the appearance of a conspiracy theory guru amid the snow. Both figures, acted by O’Donnellan, are amusing but these hallucinatory episodes are merely spoken, as if at a lectern. The performance seems to halt altogether and the play enters a purely discursive mode.It turns in on itself, too, to become self-referential. This is theatre, we are reminded, and truths are merely stories. The meta ending is a cop-out, almost a betrayal of what has been built beforehand, and its relativism leaves flat-earth theories on a par with storytelling and science. Is this what the play seeks to say? It’s all too muddy and approximate, although some of the questions raised do linger.If this is a flawed play, it is heroically so with sparks of beautiful writing, good ideas and ambition. Norman is one to watch.At the Arcola theatre, London, until 15 NovemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

After a stint in the US, he settled in the Austrian town of Kirchstetten, where he lived until his death in 1973.The public-school educated poet was in his mid-50s when he met the working-class twentysomething. “Glad our worlds of enchantment / Are so several / Neither is tempted to broach”, Auden later wrote in his poem. “I cannot tell a / Jaguar from a Bentley / And you never read”.View image in fullscreenThe front of a card from the Kurka collection.Photograph: Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH), ViennaTheir relationship appears reminiscent of the famed bond between painter Francis Bacon and his lover George Dyer, a gang-affiliated East End petty crook in London. But whereas Dyer breaking into Bacon’s apartment is a modern myth compounded by the Daniel Craig-starring biopic Love Is the Devil, in Auden’s case it was true.Though Kurka had completed an apprenticeship and was in work, he was struggling for cash. When Auden lent him his Volkswagen Beetle before embarking on a trip to the US, the young man and two accomplices used the vehicle to carry out a series of car burglaries, culminating in a break-in at the poet’s own home.They were arrested after a police chase, found in possession of stolen goods worth 34,000 Austrian schilling (the equivalent of about €20,000 today) and put on trial.Since the car was registered in Auden’s name, the court case risked making public the relationship between the young criminal and the writer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But unlike Christopher Isherwood, he was never an activist for gay rights.” Enjoying a high degree of respectability as a professor, the English writer also regularly visited the local church. “He blended in and tried to live a normal life.”View image in fullscreenA 1961 letter from Auden to Kurka.Photograph: Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH), ViennaSince same-sex acts were still a criminal offence in Austria, Kurka’s trial risked stirring up controversy around the poet, who had won a Pulitzer in 1948 and was in close contention for the Nobel prize in literature at the time.An innuendo-filled article in Austrian newspaper Kurier on 16 October 1962 did not name Auden, who had become a dual US-UK citizen in 1946, but referred only to “one of those Americans who got stuck in old Europe with its different, much freer way to live and let live”.Instead of testifying against Kurka, Auden asked his own longstanding lawyer to recommend a good advocate to defend him. Kurka was sentenced to 15 months in prison, his wife to eight.“The whole episode was a turning point in their relationship, and a positive one,” says Neundlinger. “Auden did not know whether Kurka would give away intimate information when interviewed by police – the fact that he didn’t seems to have strengthened their ties.”“Both learned a lesson,” Auden wrote in Glad. “But for which we might still beStrichundFreier” – translated as “streetwalker and john”. None of Kurka’s letters to Auden have been recovered, but in those the poet wrote from trips to New York or Berlin back to Vienna, he is warm and candid. The older man sent Kurka and his wife money to pay for flights to visit him, as well as for English lessons, and complained about feeling abandoned by his partner, the American poet Chester Kallman. “I feel a little bit lonely and wish you were here,” he wrote in November 1964.“There may have been an idea that their relationship was purely sexual or transactional in nature”, says Neundlinger, but “these letters show they enjoyed a long and intense friendship”.Explore more on these topicsWH AudenPoetryManuscripts and lettersnewsShareReuse this content"

A press representative for ECM, the record label that released many of his recordings, confirmed the news, while his personal assistant added that he died from congestive heart failure.Able to bring dynamic, highly musical playing to open-minded free jazz, R&B-leaning instrumental grooves and everything in between, DeJohnette is perhaps best known as the drummer in Davis’s fusion period, contributing to albums such as Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson and On the Corner. He was also celebrated as a regular sideman and bandleader on elegant, progressive fusion releases from ECM in the 1980s.DeJohnette was born in Chicago in 1942 and played piano from the age of five or six, as he remembered, continuing the instrument alongside the drums which he picked up in his early teens. “Piano and drums are part of the percussion family,” he later said. “There’s no separation: learning one thing feeds the other.”He started out singing doo-wop in a vocal group and playing rock’n’roll, but was gradually drawn towards jazz, and from the late 1950s had his own trio. He guested with Sun Ra and his Arkestra, fraternised with the city’s avant-garde names such as Muhal Richard Abrams and Roscoe Mitchell, and sat in for a waylaid Elvin Jones in John Coltrane’s band when they played in Chicago: “A really great, physical and spiritual experience,” DeJohnette said of the latter gig.View image in fullscreenDeJohnette with Miles Davis, Chick Corea and Dave Holland.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsHe dropped out of college and moved to New York in the mid-1960s to pursue music more seriously, packing his drums along with just $28 to his name. He quickly picked up work with Freddie Hubbard and Jackie McLean, and then a more sustained collaboration with Charles Lloyd in his quartet where he played alongside Keith Jarrett – one of his frequent collaborators over the years in various units.Time with pianist Bill Evans led him to the edge of Davis’s band at the end of the 1960s, as Davis was bringing in electric instrumentation and forging beyond the boundaries of post-bop. When drummer Tony Williams left, DeJohnette was called up. “I think playing with Miles, with Dave Holland, Chick Corea and Wayne Shorter was a very exciting period,” DeJohnette said of a band that produced Bitches Brew, Big Fun and a series of acclaimed live LPs. “We always couldn’t wait to get on the bandstand to see what kind of mischief we could get into.”Davis would have his band work up monumental grooves, starting with DeJohnette: “I’d start something and if it was OK he wouldn’t say anything and it would continue, then he’d cue each instrument in and get something going. When it would start percolating, then Miles would then play a solo over that and then let it roll, let it roll until he felt it had been exhausted.”After making Live-Evil in a septet, which DeJohnette called one of his favourites of the era due to its “funky sound, grungy sound, dirty kind of sound”, he left Davis in 1971, explaining: “I wanted to play a little freer. Miles was moving into a more specific thing that he wanted from the drums, not as much freedom to elaborate.”DeJohnette also recorded his debut under his own name in 1968, The DeJohnette Complex – the first of around 50 LPs he eventually made as a bandleader or co-leader, including forays back into piano-playing.View image in fullscreenDeJohnette in 1989.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesHis ECM relationship began in 1973 with Ruta and Daitya, a duo album with Jarrett, and as well as releases in his own groups such as Compost, Gateway and New Directions, DeJohnette played with Jan Garbarek, Pat Metheny and others for the label.DeJohnette became a regular feature on albums for Sonny Rollins from the 1970s onwards, made a number of recordings with Herbie Hancock, and later became a part of Wadada Leo Smith’s Golden Quartet – in among a huge number of other recordings. He also appeared in the Blues Brothers sequel, Blues Brothers 2000.Throughout, he brought a studied musicality to the drums rather than treating them as a mere backbeat. “I am hearing orchestrally,” he said. “I guess one example would be the cymbals are to my drum set what the sustain pedal is on the acoustic piano. So I am hearing colours.”A two-time Grammy winner, most recently in 2022 as Skyline (a collaboration with Ron Carter and Gonzalo Rubalcaba) won best jazz instrumental album, DeJohnette was also named a National Endowment for the ArtsJazzMaster in 2012.DeJohnette was married twice, first to Deirdre Davenport, who he met at junior college in Chicago. He met his second wife, Lydia, backstage at Ronnie Scott’s in London in 1966 and she later moved to the US with him. They had two daughters, Farah and Minya. He named a track after Lydia on his 2001 album Time & Space, made with Dave Holland.Explore more on these topicsJazzMiles DavisnewsShareReuse this content"

Making the film had, he said in 2021,“screwed up my life quite decently”.Andrésen’s death was announced on Sunday by Kristian Petri and Kristina Lindström, the co-directors ofThe Most Beautiful Boy in the World,a 2021 documentary about the actor.Petri told Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheterthat Andrésen died on Saturday, while Lindström remembered him as “a brave person.” No cause of death was given.View image in fullscreenBjörn Andrésen, pictured in Venice, Italy, in a still from the documentary The Most Beautiful Boy in the World.Photograph: MantarayFilm 2021Andrésen was born in Stockholm in 1955. After the suicide of his mother when he was 10, he was raised by his grandmother, who pushed him into acting and modelling because, he later said, “she wanted a celebrity in the family”.His performance in Death in Venice made him an overnight star, but the experience was not all positive. Visconti took him to a gay nightclub with a group of men when he was just 16, which made him feel “very uncomfortable”.“I knew I couldn’t react. It would have been social suicide. But it was the first of many such encounters,” he said.He said he would have told Visconti to “fuck off” if he were still alive and that the director “didn’t give a fuck” about his feelings, adding: “I’ve never seen so many fascists and assholes as there are in film and theatre. Luchino was the sort of cultural predator who would sacrifice anything or anyone for the work.”After Death in Venice, Andrésen went to Japan, where the film had been a big hit. There, he became a pop star and model, appeared in several commercials and gained a huge female following. “You’ve seen the pictures of the Beatles in America?” he told the Guardian in 2003. “It was like that. There was a hysteria about it.”Andrésen’s aspirations lay in music, and he became an accomplished pianist and musician. He continued to act, appearing in more than 30 movies and TV series, mostly made inSweden. He described his career as “chaos” and claimed Tadzio had haunted him into adulthood. “My career is one of the few that started at the absolute top and then worked its way down,” he said. “That was lonely.”Andrésen made headlines in 2003 when he objected to feminist Germaine Greer using a photograph of himself on the cover of her book The Beautiful Boy without asking him. Some of his objectionsrelated to his experience with Visconti, he said: “Adult love for adolescents is something that I am against in principle. Emotionally perhaps, and intellectually, I am disturbed by it – because I have some insight into what this kind of love is about.”But Greer’s publisher Thames and Hudson rejected his objections, saying it did not need his permission – only that of the photographer, David Bailey.Ageing helped anonymise Andrésen and he eventually found peace in being an actor. In 2019 he appeared in a small role in Ari Aster’s horror filmMidsommarplaying an elderly man who has his face smashed in with a mallet while sacrificing himself at a pagan ceremony. Andrésen was delighted by the role, saying: “Being killed in a horror movie is every boy’s dream.”Andrésen had two children with his ex-wife, the poet Suzanna Roman: a daughter, Robine, and a son, Elvin, who died of sudden infant death syndrome at nine months old.Explore more on these topicsFilmSwedenEuropeMidsommarnewsShareReuse this content"

Her mother Christine wants the world to know what the police, crown prosecution service and media got wrongMon 27 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 06.09 EDTShareWhen Christine Flack was invited by Disney to make a documentary about her daughter Caroline, one that would focus on the last few months before her suicide in 2020, of course she had to think hard. Why put Caroline back under the spotlight, expose her to more scrutiny, when tabloids and talkshows and social media had long since moved on?“I knew there could be as many bad outcomes as good outcomes,” says Christine. “Certain things will be picked up and stories might come out, including ones that aren’t true. But I’d been trying for four years to understand what happened and I still had so many questions. I’d come to a brick wall so I went ahead.” She pauses for a moment before adding: “And whatever happens next, I always say that no one can do anything worse to me now. Nothing worse can happen than Caroline dying.”Caroline Flack was one of Britain’s most successful presenters – and also one of the most talked about – when she was arrested in December 2019 and charged with assaulting her partner, Lewis Burton. She lost her job as the host of Love Island – she stepped down in order to not detract attention from the show. She lost her home – it was so besieged by the press that she never went back there after her arrest. She felt she lost the public, too, especially with the drip-drip of damning (crucially, incorrect) detail in tabloids and across social media.View image in fullscreenCaroline Flack on Love Island, 2019.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockWhen she took her life nine weeks later, in February 2020, the narrative shifted. Now there were tributes to her talent as well as stories of her struggle with mental illness. The criminal case was awkwardly glossed over and grouped in with this, as sad evidence of her troubled mind. The correctness of her prosecution, though, was barely questioned. (Celebrities can’t expect special treatment, said the pundits.) Even Nazir Afzal, a former prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS),appeared on breakfast TVto stress that “We as a country have said we need to take domestic abuse seriously”. The CPS, he insisted, could only “follow the evidence”.In Caroline Flack: Search for the Truth, Christine Flack attempts to do just this, to follow the evidence. For years, she has been haunted by the possibility that Caroline did, in fact, receive “special treatment” and was prosecuted only because the police and CPS feared the scrutiny that came with a celebrity like Caroline. They couldn’t be seen to do nothing. For Christine, understanding the decision to charge is to know why her daughter died – because she has no doubt that it was a factor in her suicide. “A different person could perhaps have come out the other side and it would be OK,” says Christine. “Not Caroline.”View image in fullscreenCaroline and Christine Flack.Photograph: Christine FlackAs Caroline’s mother, Christine had always been braced for crisis. The family had grown up in Norfolk, where Christine still lives. (Caroline’s father is not in the film – he and Christine divorced many years ago, and he is unwell.) Caroline had two older siblings as well as her twin, Jody. “As a little girl, she really had highs and lows,” says Christine. “She’d either be really laughing or really crying. I had to collect her from school a few times when they couldn’t stop the crying – but that was her and that continued.”Though Caroline had planned a future in musical theatre, she was sidetracked by the success of her presenting career. As the jobs got bigger, her life did, too. In her final decade, she was rarely out of the public eye and fronted some of TV’s biggest shows – X Factor, I’m a Celebrity, Love Island. She dated Prince Harry and Harry Styles. She won Strictly – and a Bafta. In December 2018, just over a year before she died, she found time to make her West End debut as Roxie Hart in Chicago.View image in fullscreenFlack collecting the Bafta for Love Island in 2018.Photograph: James Gourley/Bafta/ShutterstockWith all these highs, though, were the lows she kept hidden. There were spells in hospital, or she would check herself in just to be safe. One doctor suggested that Caroline had bipolar disorder, although no formal diagnosis was ever made. “Her work was her main coping mechanism,” says Christine. Caroline’s career was her escape, which was partly why she kept it separate. She didn’t even have a regular doctor as she was too scared details might be leaked to the press. “She was really ashamed,” says Flack. “She didn’t want to be known for that.”Flack never slept without her phone right next to her. “It would ring and you’d know in a second whether it was going to be something fun, a ‘Mum! Guess what?’, or if you needed to get in your car and go to her.”On the night of Caroline’s arrest, 13 December 2019, it was Jody, Caroline’s twin, who called Christine to tell her that Caroline was in a central London police cell. The previous night, Caroline and Burton had been out separately, returning late to Caroline’s flat in north London. They had both been drinking, and went to bed. Burton was sleeping when a woman messaged him. Caroline read it. She was drunk, angry and upset when she went to wake him. The inquest heard that she later told police: “I had his phone in one hand and mine in the other. I whacked him round the head. There was no excuse for it. I was just upset. I admit I did it. He was cheating on me.”The inquest heard that a huge row ensued where Caroline became hysterical. When Burton threatened to call the police, Caroline begged him not to. (“If you call the police, I’m done.”) When he did, she harmed herself and by the time police arrived, she was seriously injured, frenzied and half-naked. Burton went back to his home – the knock to his head required no medical intervention. Caroline’s phone was taken as evidence as the likely weapon and she was admitted to hospital, where treatment took 12 hours.Then she was arrested.Domestic violence needs to be taken seriously. I know how bad it is. But this wasn’t that“While Jody was outside the police station, a police officer went out and told her: ‘It’s all right – the CPS has thrown it out. Just wait here for her,’” says Christine. That initial CPS document judged that prosecuting wasn’t in the public interest because there was no history of domestic violence and Caroline was 40 with no previous convictions. It noted that Caroline had repeatedly admitted the assault and that the injured party, Burton, did not support a prosecution. The document concluded: “There is nothing so serious about this incident which means the guidelines [to issue a caution] need to be diverted from.” For context,out of 1.4m domesticabuse-related incidents attended by police in England and Wales in the year ending March 2024, 49,046 resulted in a charge. About 3.5%.Shortly after, though, a detective inspector came on duty and intervened. She had a shooting to deal with that night, as well as a vulnerable missing person and, according to the documentary, this DI had no history of challenging CPS decisions. But she chose to appeal against this one, arguing that there had been no clear admission of guilt (the coroner found that Caroline had admitted to hitting Burton) and that “she has caused significant injury” to Burton. As a result, Caroline was charged with assault by beating.The bail conditions prevented Caroline from contacting Burton and this left her further isolated in the weeks ahead. (Burton wroteon social media that not being able to see his girlfriend was “heartbreaking”.) In cases of alleged domestic abuse, where there is a previous history and a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour, no-contact bail conditions are vital to protect vulnerable victims. They can save lives. In this case? A one-off incident sparked by an alleged infidelity, a victim who was 6ft 3in? Christine doesn’t understand it.View image in fullscreenChristine Flack … ‘I’ve tried for years to speak to people in the public field. Getting their perspectives is what made the film worthwhile.’Photograph: Amit Lennon/The GuardianShe knows she is treading a very fine line here. Christine is adamant that she doesn’t want to minimise the harms caused by domestic abuse. “Domestic violence needs to be taken seriously,” she says. “I know how bad it is. I know people who have been frightened to go home, who have been through horrendous times, trapped in controlling, abusive relationships and nothing has been done to help. I have family members who have experienced it. But this wasn’t that.”In the documentary, Nazir Afzal agrees that, in his words, it “makes no sense”. In the immediate aftermath of Caroline’s death, he had publicly defended the prosecution without knowing the details. Having agreed to examine the evidence for the documentary, he now says he would have reached a different conclusion. It was a one-off incident with no previous history, he says, with no coercive and controlling dynamic, and Burton had remained adamant that Caroline shouldn’t be prosecuted, repeatedly stating that he regretted calling the police. “The worst thing that should have happened is a caution,” he tells Christine in the film. Caroline’s celebrity status is Afzal’s only explanation for the charge. “I can’t think of any reason [for the CPS] to proceed other than being scared of what would have been said about them.”View image in fullscreenCaroline Flack in 2017.Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty ImagesIn response, a CPS spokesperson stated: “A person’s celebrity status never influences whether a case is taken forward. We are satisfied that the prosecution was correctly brought.” A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police pointed out that police engaged with a number of independent reviews of their conduct on the case. “While there was organisational learning for us on points of process, no misconduct has been identified.”For Christine, speaking to Afzal has been bittersweet. “It’s twofold,” she says. “I hate it – because he’s saying there was no need for it to have happened. But I hope people listen to him. I’ve tried for years to speak to people in the public field. Getting their perspectives is what made the film worthwhile.”The speed at which Caroline’s life unravelled was startling. Her home was under siege, so she moved into a hotel, barely leaving her room. The next morning brought headlines including “Caroline whack!” (the Sun) and “Flack attack!” (Daily Star). Within days, she had“stepped down” from Love Island. Within weeks, she was watchingsomeone else host it. Her texts to friends and family from this time are painful to read: “I’ve lost it all and so publicly.” “Am lowest I’ve ever been in my life.”View image in fullscreenCaroline and Christine hugging outside Highbury Corner Magistrates Court, London, on 23 December 2019.Photograph: Mark R Milan/GC ImagesThe first magistrate hearing, two days before Christmas 2019, gave a glimpse of what might lie ahead. “The CPS assigned a top prosecutor,” says Christine. “Again – why?” In laying out the charges, the CPS barrister stated that Caroline had hit Burton with a lamp and caused “significant injury”. The room, the lawyer said, had been “like a scene from a horror movie”. “All the blood was Caroline’s,” says Christine. “That just wasn’t understood.” The use of the lamp is something Caroline and Burton absolutely denied – and certainly no lamp was ever removed from the scene in evidence. Still, the headlines ran with “Mad Flack beat lover with lamp” (Daily Star). On New Year’s Day, the Sun ran a leaked picture of Caroline’s bedroom taken on the night of the incident. “Photo shows attack carnage” read the front page.“To Caroline, it felt like there was no way out,” says Christine. The implication that this “carnage” was blood spilled by Burton because of injuries inflicted by Caroline while he slept was certainly career-ending. But to correct it with the truth was to reveal her most private self, something she’d kept closely guarded for most of her life and her greatest shame. What she dreaded, should the trial proceed, was the release of police body cam footage. Caroline saw no way forward once the world had seen her barely clothed, drunk, hysterical, injured. (“I don’t think I can cope with the shame of it all” read one of her texts.)There were times, in clear moments, when she did see a path through. “We spoke every day and if she didn’t see me, she saw Jody,” says Christine. “She had good friends that she trusted. On Christmas Day, she came home and she wanted to play games and do things, it was just lovely.” Caroline had begun making plans, too, and was speaking to a documentary team about sharing her experience, explaining herself. “At one point, she said, ‘I think I’m just going to live in Ibiza’ which is a place she loved,” says Christine. “I wish she had! One day she’d feel as if she could cope, then the next, something else would happen. There is always a way forward. I want everyone to know that.”On 14 February, Caroline learned that attempts by her legal team to have the case thrown out had failed. The following day, she took her life.It was Jody who found her. “By the time I arrived, the police were there, and Caroline was lying on the floor,” says Christine. “They wouldn’t let me touch her. I’ll never forget that.” She barely remembers the period beyond, though. “Covid came a month later and I do remember that I was pleased for lockdown,” she says. “You lose someone, the whole world keeps going and you see all the things that Caroline should be doing. I loved lockdown because everything stopped.”View image in fullscreenChristine with Jody and Caroline in the 1980s.Photograph: Christine FlackSlowly, in the months ahead, the questions began to form. Was Caroline treated the same as anyone else by police and CPS or was she treated differently? Did the media coverage push her to suicide? “I think I’ve got as many answers as I can now,” says Christine. “I hope this programme can set the record straight. I wish I’d done it before Caroline died. At the time, though, in the middle of it, we were being told to stay silent, that it would all be OK and the charges would be dropped. Caroline was telling me, ‘Mum, don’t say anything.’”In moments, Christine has blamed herself. “I’ve asked myself, ‘Why didn’t you do this?’ ‘Why didn’t you do that?’ Sometimes, if I’m low, I think about what she must have felt that day she died. That’s the part I hate the most.” More often, though, Christine thinks about the good times. There were many. “At home, I’ve got so much of her stuff but it’s not depressing,” she says. “I’ve got her glitterball from Strictly on a shelf, her awards, her front pages and covers. Jody has a room full of Caroline’s things, her scripts, her shows. Someone gave us a beautiful portrait they’d painted of Caroline in a shoot she’d done with syrup running down her head.“My memories now are usually fun,” she continues, “because that’s what Caroline was like in our life. When she walked into a room, she could change everything, she could lift the day.”Caroline Flack: Search for the Truth is on Disney+ from 10 NovemberIn the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Adventurous and irresponsible, she’s happier than she has ever beenPaula CocozzaMon 27 Oct 2025 03.00 EDTShareAlese Johnstonwas sitting on the couch one Sunday morning, reading the Wall Street Journal, when she came across an article by a 60-year-old writer who felt he’d become boring – always telling his friends the same stories. “I do that,” Johnston thought. “So a couple of weeks later, when I turned 70, I committed to doing 70 new things over the course of the year.”Johnston set up a website,Fabulous70.com. She made a spreadsheet, and started filling it with ideas. The only rule was: “It had to be something I’d never done before.” Her first “first” was to eat a nem – a type of spring roll – at a supper club where she lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.She also attended a conference to learn her erotic blueprint – “it pushed a lot of boundaries, but was transformative” – and as a result, she says, has “had some of the best sex of my life”. Over the next 12 months, she took a pole-dancing class and a flying lesson, ate her dessert before her main, walked new trails, minted a meme coin and got a Brazilian wax.From then on, when she got together with friends, “that was the first question they would ask me: ‘What did you do that was new this week?’ I couldn’t even go to the chiropractor’s office without having to report what I had done.”“We ought not accept excuses from ourselves,” she says now. “I didn’t realise how much I had been doing that.”View image in fullscreenJohnston experienced her first Kansas City Chiefs game.Photograph: Jessica Johnston-MyersTwo years before embarking on her project, Johnston got divorced. She and her husband had been married for 30 years. “But I just realised I wasn’t being me. It became important to explore who I really was at this age, and to be honest with myself,” she says.“I think I was always trying to be responsible. For use of my time, use of my money.” Until her late 60s, she stayed in when her partner didn’t want to go out, rather than socialise alone. “You always get that question: ‘Where’s your husband?’”Therapy helped. She kept a journal. “And one of the questions I had to answer was: what do I want? Which is not something I’d spent a lot of time with. That was life-altering, to sit down and be honest about what I wanted” – rather than what her partner, daughter or grandchild wanted. “That’ll teach you some things,” she says.One day, she says, she woke up and realised: “I don’t need anybody else’s permission. It’s actually OK to be a little irresponsible. The world does not end because you go out on your own. So now I do.”The fear of irresponsibility had always been there. “If you want to analyse my childhood, my dad was the fastest belt in the west,” she says. “You did not argue with him. There were beatings coming. That’s just how he ran his household. So I was always a little gun-shy.”Johnston grew up on a farm, 45 miles from where she lives now, and was “scared of my own shadow”. Even now, she feels a “kneejerk reaction, to duck. You always think you’re in trouble for doing the wrong thing. Learning to let go of that is a huge step.”Against her father’s wishes, she went to college in her late teens, where she studied art. Her first marriage, in her 20s, didn’t last long. To enable Johnston to support herself as a single parent, her grandmother sent her to night school. “I learned to code, back in the 1980s, before it was mainstream,” Johnston says.She became a banking consultant, helping to write code on the big mainframes that ran the banks, moving data when banks were bought out or sold. These days, she is an entrepreneur. She is in the process of launching a new project which aims to combat loneliness and foster longevity.Johnston is 71 now, with her 70 missions completed, but she still looks for new experiences. “It has become who I am,” she says. “I’m much more adventurous. I thrive on learning new things. I feel as if I’ve found myself. This is really the best season of my life.”Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60?Explore more on these topicsHappinessA new start after 60Health & wellbeingHobbiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Many of us will reach for rakes and leaf grabbers – tried and tested tools that remain perfectly sufficient for the job for most people. However, for those of you with a larger garden, deciduous trees or a growing disinclination for thankless, laborious jobs (as I do as I get older), I’ve tested a selection ofelectric leaf blowers and garden vacuumsdesigned to reduce the physical load.A lack of leavesThe trouble is, you can’t produce a test like this overnight. I contacted the first supplier in August, gathering review samples over the late summer. In the end, I had 10 leaf blowers ready to test, but one serious hurdle – the leaves were still on the trees.I lined up contingency plans. I slowly gathered hedge trimmings, until someone tidied the bags I’d been hoarding and took them to the recycling centre. I gave our bay trees a serious haircut, which smelled amazing, but it didn’t yield many leaves. I was on the verge of raiding my local woods for anything left of last year’s fall. But then the horse chestnut trees on a neighbouring street gave up after the dry summer and started ditching their leaves. I’m a little worried for them – they dropped long before the other trees even started changing colour – but it didn’t stop me gleefully filling a couple of bulk bags, dragging them back to my house and tipping them on to my lawn.Blowing up a stormView image in fullscreenThe ‘satisfying’ testing setup.Photograph: Andy Shaw/The GuardianFrom then on, the testing ran smoothly. I timed the battery life, and ensured a decent air speed of at least 45mph, using the anemometer I have to measure the airflow throughvacuum cleaners.It was the leaf-blowing tests I enjoyed the most, though. For each blower, I tipped a 14-litre bucket full of leaves in front of a marker, then had to dig deep into my reserves of self-control not to kick the pile around the garden. Instead, I cranked up the power of the blower I was testing and blasted a hole into the middle of the leaf pile. It wasn’t quite as satisfying as redistributing piles of leaves with my feet, but it came a very close second.I measured how far leaves travelled and how big a hole was created, to get an idea of the overall power and the working area of each one. My favourite blower,the Milwaukee M18 Fuel Blower FBLG3-802, sent leaves an impressive distance, despite being light and easy to carry around. For smaller jobs, the svelteBosch Universal leaf blower 18V-130would do well – with a much narrower working angle for focused, targeted blowing.After all this, I had leaves all over the place. Thankfully, half of the blowers I tested were also garden vacuums (theStihl SHA 56proved particularly efficient at sucking up leaves). Testing and tidying up at the same time?

As it turned out, the recipes had been converted in-house by the publisher, using a straightforward formula to change celsius to fahrenheit. What no one had noticed was that the conversion also needed to take into account the oven setting: fan-forced versus conventional heat. Many American ovens, it seems, still don’t have a fan function. Reader, there were tears.Scarred by that experience, the first thing I did when I signed my next American contract was to find a tester in Australia and the US who could bake every recipe in their own kitchens before a single page went to print.View image in fullscreenSmall differences in flour, sugar, cream and oven temperatures across countries can affect your cake: Pictured:Helen Goh’s pineapple pudding cake with salted tamarind caramel.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian. Food styling: Lucy Turnbull. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Catarina CardosoIt’s not just oven temperature, of course. Subtle differences in measurements and ingredient types in recipes can trip up even experienced cooks. In Australia and the UK, baking is mostly metric: grams and millimetres rule, but tablespoons in Australia are 20ml while in the UK and US it is 15ml. It seems minor but that extra teaspoon can affect delicate batters or dough, so I often revert to teaspoons, which is 5ml in every country, to avoid any surprises.Australian “plain flour” is equivalent to American “all purpose” while the UK’s “strong flour” is bread flour. Self-raising flour (“self-rising” in the US) exists in all three countries but differs in protein content and leavening. American self-rising flour is soft and light, perfect for their biscuits and pancakes, but less sturdy for cakes or scones. US “cake flour”, used to produce a soft, fine crumb in cakes, is not easy to come by in Australia and the UK, so techniques such as folding batter gently, so as not to overwork the gluten, is important.Caster sugar, the go-to for baking in Australia and the UK, is considered a specialist ingredient in the US where it is sold as “superfine sugar”. American bakers mostly use regular granulated sugar, so instructions to cream butter and sugar, especially for a light cake batter or pavlovas, can take longer.Cream can be a minefield. I remember making my favourite lemon loaf cake at a baking demo in the US and only realising too late that the “heavy cream” listed as the equivalent of UK double cream was thinner than what I usually use at home. The resulting cake was dense, heavy and lacking the rich, silky mouthfeel I expected. The difference may seem small, but as I discovered, fat content has a huge impact on the texture of baked goods.In the UK, all types of cream are readily available in supermarkets, but in Australia, double cream is usually a specialty item, sold only at select shops. I recently had an experience on Australian live television while assembling a cake sandwiched with whipped cream: the double cream called for in the recipe thickened into something almost like clotted cream after just a few turns of a hand whisk – I stopped just short of it turning into butter!View image in fullscreen‘The difference may seem small, but as I discovered, fat content has a huge impact on the texture of baked goods’: Helen Goh, pastry chef, author and recipe developer.Photograph: John DavidUK double cream (about 48% fat) is rich and whippable; single cream (about 18%) is pourable; clotted cream (55-60%) is spoonable. Australian thickened cream (about 35% fat, stabilised) and pure cream (about 35%) are versatile, while US heavy cream (36-40%) is closest to UK double cream.So, when converting recipes, it’s crucial to consider both fat content and stability. Sometimes that means adding a little mascarpone to American heavy cream to mimic the richness of UK double cream, or slightly diluting a very rich Australian premium double cream with cold milk and adjusting whipping speed or temperature to achieve the right consistency.Baking internationally can be confusing. But by understanding each country’s ingredients, you can more accurately translate recipes while preserving texture and flavour – and that home-baked goodness.View image in fullscreenFor children and adults alike: Helen Goh’s strawberry iced finger buns.Photograph: Laura Edwards/Murdoch BooksHelen Goh’s strawberry iced finger buns – recipeI sometimes buy finger buns from the supermarket, ostensibly for the kids, but the truth is I love them as much as they do. But while it’s joyous sinking your teeth into those pillowy soft buns on day one, there’s something slightly disturbing when they remain eversoft on days three or four. What is even in them? So I thought I’d have a go at making my own.Asking you to boil the milk and then let it cool might seem a bit crazy, but there’s method in the madness. Boiling the milk breaks down the proteins and results in a softer, more tender bread. It also makes the milk more effective in hydrating the flour, improving the texture of the dough. But make sure to cool the milk before mixing in the yeast – that’s essential to get the rise.Makes12For the milk bread150ml full-cream milk2 tsp active dried yeast30g caster sugar375g plain flour75ml water, boiling hot15g milk powder¾ tsp fine sea salt1 egg50g unsalted butter, cut into 1 cm pieces, then left to softenVegetable oil, for greasingFor the icing60g strawberries, hulled and roughly chopped300g icing sugar½ tsp vanilla bean paste20g liquid glucose(optional)To make the bread, put the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Set aside to cool to 38C (cool enough to touch) then whisk in the yeast and two teaspoons of the sugar. Let it stand to allow the yeast to activate and froth, about five minutes.Meanwhile, place 75g of the flour in a small heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling water over and mix with a spoon to form a stiff, shaggy paste. Cover the bowl and set aside to cool.Ten baking tips (and life lessons) from Australia’s best bakersRead morePut the remaining 300g of flour, the milk powder, salt and remaining 20g of sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and stir with a whisk to combine. Add the flour and water paste, the yeast/milk mixture and the egg and mix with the dough hook on a low speed for about two minutes, until a scraggly dough forms.Add the butter, a little at a time, until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium and knead for about three minutes, until smooth. Scrape the dough out on to a clean work surface and knead gently for a couple of minutes, then shape into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, around one to two hours, depending on the temperature of the room.Meanwhile, prepare a baking tin (approximately 35 × 25 cm measured across the base) by lining it with baking paper.When the dough has doubled in size, knock it down with your fist and turn it out on to a clean work surface. Cut it into 12 equal pieces, roughly 60g each. Taking one piece at a time, press the dough into a rough square approximately 10cm. Starting from the side closest to you, roll up into a small log, pinching and smoothing the ends and seam to seal, creating a little sausage. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, and place them 2cm apart on the lined baking tray.Cover the tray loosely with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for 45 to 60 minutes, until doubled in size.When the buns are well risen, preheat the oven to 170C fan.

Not only were they an unexpected hit with my 18-month-old, but, after trying one myself, I instantly crossed out the saffron arancini at the top of my list for an upcoming lunch party and replaced it with a delirious, “OMG make these fritters!” Not bad for a five-ingredient dish, and a lot less faff than arancini.Beetroot, apple and feta frittersServe with a green salad and the dip alongside for a filling dinner on a cold evening.Prep15 minCook20 minServes2-42apples(I used Discovery)2 medium beetroot, peeled and grated1egg200g feta, crumbled60g self-raising flour(gluten-free if you have it)Olive oil,for fryingFor the dip3 heapedtbsp Greek yoghurt3 heapedtbsp mayonnaise½ lemon, juice and zestA pinch of sea saltGrate the apples skin and all into a clean tea towel, then twist and squeeze the towel over the sink to remove as much moisture as you can. Tip the grated apple into a large bowl, then add the grated beetroot, egg and crumbled feta, and mix well. Scatter in the flour and mix again.Put a half-teaspoon of oil in a large, nonstick frying pan, and bring to a medium heat. Scoop out ping-pong-ball-sized pieces of mixture, and pat out each one into a neat round. Fry the fritters in batches for two to three minutes on each side, until evenly browned, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining fritter mixture.While you’re frying, whisk the yoghurt, mayo and lemon juice and zest, then season to taste. Serve the fritters hot, with the dip alongside, and a green salad if you wish.Explore more on these topicsFoodQuick and easyVegetablesMain courseFruitGluten-freeSnacksrecipesShareReuse this content"

I scatter them, roughly chopped, over my morning yoghurt and fruit bowl, and when I feel an attack of the munchies coming on, I try (although I often fail) to reach for a handful of them in place of something sugary. These nutrient-dense superstars are high on the list of nutritionists’ favourite anti-inflammatory foods, and while all their health benefits are obviously terrific, I love them simply because they bring rich, buttery flavour, interest, and delightful texture to my cooking.Almond crusted chicken schnitzel (pictured top)Traditionally, schnitzels are coated in crisp breadcrumbs, but this delicious version using almonds and cornflour makes this nuttily delicious and suitable for anyone avoiding gluten.Prep5 minCook45 minServes44 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts50g parmesan, roughly chopped250g blanched almondsZest of1 lemon50gcornflourSea saltand black pepper2 eggs, lightly beaten1tbspdijon mustardLemon wedges, to servePut a chicken breast between two sheets of baking paper, then use a rolling pin to beat the chicken until it’s about 1.5cm thick all over. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.Put the parmesan in a food processor and blitz until finely chopped. Add the almonds and blitz again until you have a coarse crumb. Transfer to a shallow bowl and stir in the lemon zest.Place the cornflour in a separate shallow bowl and season generously. Combine the eggs, mustard, and a tablespoon of water in a shallow bowl and whisk to combine. Dust the chicken evenly in cornflour, shake off any excess, then dip into the egg mixture and press into the almond mixture, coating evenly. Place on a baking tray lined with baking paper.To cook the schnitzels, put a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat, then pour in 1cm oil. When the oil is hot, fry two schnitzels for five or six minutes on each side, until golden and cooked through. Repeat with the remaining schnitzels, using a little more oil if needed. Serve with lemon wedges, salad, some potatoes or a side of pickles.Harissa baked hake with olives and walnut salsaView image in fullscreenRavinder Bhogal’s harissa baked hake with olives and walnut salsa.Baked fish is so light that the addition of chopped nuts in the salsa gives it some heft.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Ultra 3 is Apple’s answer to adventure watches such asGarmin’s Fenix 8 Prowhile being a full smartwatch for the iPhone with all the trimmings. As such, it is not cheap, costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399) – £50 less than2023’s model– sitting above the £369-plusSeries 11and £219 Watch SE 3.From the outside it doesn’t look like a lot has changed for the Ultra 3 over itstwo-year-old predecessor. Available in natural or black titanium, it is exactly the same size but squeezes in a slightly bigger screen with smaller bezels making it the largest on an Apple Watch.The display is much brighter when viewed at an angle, which makes seeing it at a glance a lot easier, and now shows ticking seconds when idle like theSeries 10and 11. It is very bright, covered by super-hard sapphire glass and has one of the very best screens on a watch.View image in fullscreenThe chunky crown and armoured side button help prevent accidental presses during workouts while still making them easy to use with gloves.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ultra 3 has the same S10 chip asthe Series 11and the same excellent touch-free gestures. Double tap your thumb and index finger to press buttons or scroll, or flick your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss alarms, notifications or return to the watch face.Apple has managed to fit a 6% larger battery into the Ultra 3, which lasts a good three-plus days between charges with general usage and sleep tracking over night. Most people will need to put it on the charger every third night, which is a good day longer than any other Apple Watch, although some way behind the week-long battery of adventure watchrivals from Garminand others.The watch fully charges in about two hours, hitting 50% in 30 minutes via the included USB-C magnetic charging puck.Satellite and 5GThe watch supports 5G, if you have a compatible phone plan, and has noticeably stronger cellular reception in weaker signal areas for 4G. Apple has also brought its free satellite SOS messagingfrom the iPhoneto the Ultra 3, which allows you to contact the emergency services via text using satellites when out of cellular signal range. Satellites can also be used for Find My location tracking and messages to friends and loved ones, although the latter is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico, and both need a compatible cellular data plan.The Ultra 3 runs the same recentwatchOS 26 softwareas the Series 11 and other Apple Watches, which introduced a revamped design and some new watch faces. In addition, the Ultra 3 has an attractive new Waypoint watch face, which has a live compass that shows points of interest around you. It joins a few other information-dense Ultra-exclusive faces, including the Wayfinder and Modular Ultra.View image in fullscreenA selection of faces for the Ultra 3, including the new Exactograph (top left), Waypoint (top middle) and Flux (top right) and a shot of the always-on display off angle.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsCase size:49 x 44mmCase thickness:12mmWeight:61.8gProcessor:S10Storage:64GBOperating system:watchOS 26Water resistance:100 metres (10ATM)Sensors:HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, dual-band GPS, compass, altimeterConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, wifi n, NFC, UWB, satellite, optional 5G/eSIMTop-notch sport and health trackingView image in fullscreenThe domed sapphire glass sensor cluster on the back records most of the health metrics, sitting comfortably on the wrist.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ultra supports the same comprehensive health and fitness-tracking capabilities as thestandard Apple Watch. That includes a wealth of heart health monitoring, such as ECG, abnormal rhythm notifications, blood oxygen tracking, and new hypertension alerts that analyse 30-days of readings for signs of high blood pressure.It has Apple’s new sleep score metric, which makes it easier to understand your tracked sleep, plus wrist temperature monitoring, cycle tracking with ovulation estimation and many other tools.The Ultra builds on the workout tracking of the standard Apple Watch in a couple of ways. The extra action button in the side can be used to quickly start a workout, but unlike Apple’s other watches you can wait until you have a GPS lock before starting the exercise by pressing it again.View image in fullscreenThe precision start feature is exclusive to the Ultra, but should be on the standard Apple Watch, too.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe best bit is a dual-band GPS system that boosts tracking accuracy in tricky environments, such as dense urban areas with tall buildings or in woods. It’s a feature found onthe top running watchesand has been improved since theinitial Ultrato become one of the most accurate on the market, matching or beating the very best in urban GPS stress tests.It also tracks a good number of metrics including the usual distance, pace and cadence, plus running power and dynamics, training load and heart rate zones. It can be loaded with structured workouts such as intervals, and it has a very good track detection mode for doing laps. The Ultra has similarly good cycling, swimming and triathlon profiles, plus diving to 40-metre depths and at least 22 other activities.View image in fullscreenThe bright orange action button can be customised to trigger different features, including workouts, a torch, stopwatch, voice memos or other actions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianCombined with the large and bright screen, and the decent 11 to 14-hour battery life when tracking running at its highest accuracy levels, the Ultra 3 makes for a surprisingly good sports watch.The Ultra also supports Apple’s newWorkout Buddy AI coach, which works with walks, runs, hikes, cycling and various other training workouts, giving you pep-talks before, during and after activities via Bluetooth headphones. But it requires you to carry an iPhone 15 Pro or later for it to work, which is a drag.SustainabilityApple says the battery should last more than1,000 full charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for£95. Damage repairs cost£489.The watch contains more than 40% recycled material, including cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impactin its report.PriceThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 comes in a choice of two colours and multiple bands costing from£749(€899/$799/A$1,399).VerdictThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, baddest and best Apple Watch the company makes but it isn’t a massive leap over previous models.Other than satellite SOS messaging, which could genuinely save your life in an emergency, the rest of the watch is simply a refinement of the Ultra 2.But the added battery life is very welcome, so is a bigger and fancier screen in the same size watch. New software features are great and the wrist-flick gesture for dismissing things is the best thing added to any Apple Watch in recent memory.The Ultra is still a rarer sight than other models, so if you wanted a less ubiquitous Apple Watch this is it. While those looking for a dedicated top-priced sports watch might overlook it in favour of a Garmin or similar, the Ultra 3 has all the ingredients to be a first-rate training companion – as long as you can charge it more frequently – while still being the best smartwatch you can get with an iPhone.The Ultra 3 is the best Apple Watch. Just don’t expect it to be a massive upgrade over older Ultra models.Pros:fantastic screen, rugged yet sophisticated design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, three-day battery life, 5G and satellite SOS/messaging, top health tracking, great activity tracking with dual-band GPS, extra action button, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre dive-ready, long software support.Cons:very expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, no big upgrade on previous Ultra models, shorter battery life than adventure watch rivals.View image in fullscreenThe Ultra 3 is a big Apple Watch, but fairly compact and easy to slip under cuffs compared with the adventure watch competition.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsApple WatchAppleWearable technologyGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A Haribo Starmix 22-pack from Tesco now costs £3, up from £2.35 last year.Meanwhile, the price of chocolate on shop shelves climbed by 18.1% in the year to September, according to official figures.To keep yourHalloweenoutlay low, bulk-buy and check packets. “Choose individually wrapped treats – they last longer, stay hygienic and reduce waste if they’re not all handed out,” says Zoe Morris, a savings expert from VoucherCodes. “Only buy sweets your household enjoys – that way, any leftovers won’t go to waste.”Morris recommends comparing the cost per kilogram, but if you are giving a treat to each person who comes, the number in each bag will be as important.At the time of writing, the retailer B&M was selling aTricky Treats Popping Candy multipackof 36 sweets for £1. At Morrisons there is a 16-pack ofSwizzels Luscious Lolliesfor £1.25 – or £1 if you have a More Card – while Asda has theHaribo Share the Happy22-bag multipack, for £1.98.DIY your costumesRaiding your wardrobe and using clothes you already own is one of the best ways to save. A black top paired with some DIY ears made with an old headband and some black card cut into triangles, makes for a mysterious black cat.While a vampire costume from Amazon costs about £20, your local charity shop may have a cheap white shirt that you can accessorise with a length of black material and makeup. These can also be reused or repurposed.‘A little mix of classy and gore always works’: costume and makeup pros on how to win HalloweenRead moreGet creative with props: stick some googly eyes on a black umbrella and attach dangling thick strands of fabric to make a spooky spider, or add fake blood stains (flour, water and red food colouring) to some damaged old clothes to be a zombie.Ditch the wasteful decorBritish shoppers buy an average of 10 Halloween items every year,a report for Gumtree in 2024 found, with many ending up in landfill.“People think impressive Halloween decorations require expensive props from specialist shops, but some of the most effective scares come from simple materials you already have,” says Jessie Brooks, the product manager at the art kit website Davincified.This includes cutting out spooky shapes on cardboard (from £1 a pack at The Works) – think bats, spiders or creepy hands, and hanging them from ceilings or on doors and windows.Make floating ghosts using white balloons or old white sheets, and glow sticks (£1.50 for apack of 15 from Tesco). Plant pots could be styled to look like pumpkin jack-o'-lanterns by using a marker pen, or sticking on adhesive felt in the shape of the eyes, nose and mouth.If you do want to purchase decorations, make sure they can be reused year after year. Cancer Research stocks aspider doorstop for £6.99– perfect to display in October but practical all year round. Look ahead, and go to charity shops during November to pick up people’s no-longer-wanted bits from this Halloween often at a fraction of the price.Plan shared activities“Hosting at home, or heading to a house party, can also be much cheaper than going out,” says James Andrews, a money expert at the website Be Clever With Your Cash.For families, some Halloween activities and days out could cost a family of four more than £130, with Legoland Windsor’s Brick or Treat events starting at £34 a head.For a low-cost alternative, host a Halloween party withcheap, or free, games. These could include apple bobbing (a six-pack bag of apples fromAsda costs 99p). Place them in a big bowl of water and participants have to grab an apple with their mouths. Or pin the wart on the witch’s nose – a Halloween version of pin the tail on the donkey.You could recreate the theme park experience by putting together a living room haunted house, using DIY decorations and fancy dress. Use string to make spiders’ webs, add cardboard-cutout silhouettes to windows for a spooky feel and download a free sound effects app. Hide your phone or speaker while the noises of creaking doors, distant screams or chains rattling play in the background.“Halloween is all about creativity,” says Andrews. “And with a little planning, you can enjoy all the thrills without giving your wallet a fright.”Save on your pumpkinMost supermarkets have discounts at this time of year. Sainsbury’s was selling carving pumpkins for£2(or £1.75 with a Nectar card), while Asdadoes one for £1.88. For those on an even tighter budget, Tesco’s munchkin pumpkins are60p(or two for £1 with a Clubcard), and Aldi’s only 42p.Have a day out at a free-to-enter pumpkin patch. There are many around the UK, includingOrway Porch farmin Devon,Doddington Hallin Lincolnshire, andSouth farm in Rodmell, East Sussex.And do not think the pumpkin has to be thrown away after it has been carved – if it is in a good state and washed, eat it. Roast the body and blend the flesh for soups and purees. There are many seasonalrecipes to choose from. Try pumpkin and parmesan crumble, Mauritian curry or a pickle.However, do not use any that have been left outside or exposed to flames, because of bacteria.Get deals on spooky filmsNothing conjures up the Halloween spirit more than a horror film, or a family-friendly spooky movie. Look out for offers on films to watch at home –Sky Storehas newly released films such as Weapons and 28 Years Later on sale.Makethe most of TV streaming, as many have added seasonal films. Netflix has movies such as Beetlejuice and The Witches, Disney+ has The Nightmare Before Christmas and Hocus Pocus, and Amazon Prime streams classics such as Corpse Bride.‘People think impressive decorations require expensive props. But some of the most effective scares come from simple materials you already have’Jessie Brooks, DavincifiedMany of these services offer free trials, so you could sign up to one, binge-watch all the scary films you like, and then cancel before you are rolled over into a full paid-for subscription.Alternatively, save on fees by opting for a with-ads service – at Disney+ and Netflix they now cost £5.99 a month.Some cinemas do special deals.Cineworldis hosting Halloween screenings for £5.99 a ticket – with films including A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy’s Revenge and The Descent. If you are in London,Time Outhas opened a popup outdoor cinema, with tickets going for £6.66. Films being shown include Addams Family Values and Gremlins.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksHalloweenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bidfoodused a fleet management company,VMS, to arrange repairs and provide a hire car. Since then, I have had no meaningful updates from VMS. The manager assigned to my case is unavailable when I ring, and promised callbacks don’t materialise. In the meantime, I have received five penalty charge notices (PCNs) for unpaid Ulez (ultra-low emission zone) charges, indicating that my car has been driven without my knowledge.BN,BrightonThus begins one of the most extraordinary cases I have ever investigated. Soon afterwards, I received an almost identical complaint fromNCin Hertfordshire. Her car was damaged by a lorry belonging to food wholesaler Bidfood in June.VMS, which is contracted by Bidfood to log claims and manage repairs after such incidents, towed it away and provided a hire car. Like BN, she is still awaiting news of its return and has to continue monthly personal contract purchase payments for a vehicle she has no access to. “I’ve had radio silence from VMS,” she writes.This is where the tale darkens. Both vehicles, I discovered, were taken by VMS to its contracted repair shop in Kent, called Cobra Coachworks. The repairs were duly carried out and paid for.They have been held effectively to ransom there ever since, along with about 23 other vehicles, because of an unrelated commercial dispute between Cobra and VMS.How do I know? Because VMS and Cobra both readily told me.Cobra’s managing director, Greg Ebeling, said he was refusing to release them because of money he alleges VMS owes for unrelated contracts. He added that he was also retaining the 23 other vehicles brought in by VMS on behalf of other clients, including Iceland.VMS confirmed this figure but won’t tell me how many of those were owned by members of the public. Iceland declined to comment.According to VMS, Cobra is demanding it pays £189,000 in arrears, that have nothing to do with the vehicles, but has failed to provide evidence of any debt.VMS, which is paid hire fees by Bidfood for the vehicles it provides affected owners from its fleet, seems to have been remarkably cavalier about the saga.It appointed a solicitor to write to Cobra demanding the return of BN and NC’s cars the day after I intervened last month, and only then appears to have considered upping the ante. The solicitor tells me: “We have highlighted that our client may be forced into seeking an injunction for release of vehicles, and that any separate alleged monetary dispute should be dealt with under normal court procedure and protocols, as opposed to using vehicles as attempted leverage.”Extraordinarily, Bidfood says it wasn’t told of NC’s case until August, a month after her car was repaired and paid for, and was unaware of BN’s predicament until I alerted it in September.“There have been unacceptable delays by VMS Global and the withholding of vehicles, following disputes with garages they engaged to undertake repairs,” it says. “These issues were not escalated to us as they should have been. Given the unacceptable service that both members of the public and Bidfood have received, we have ended our relationship with VMS Global.”It says it would continue to work with VMS to secure the release of the two cars, and advised the vehicle owners to report them to the police as stolen. The police told both it was a civil matter.And what of the PCNs issued to BN for unpaid Ulez charges while his car was in Cobra’s possession?‘Crash for cash’: moped riders target your insurance detailsRead moreEbeling, who tells me all the vehicles were being “securely stored”, claimed a Ulez camera happens to be bang outside the entrance to the premises where cars are taken, and therefore triggers a fine each time they are removed for out-of-hours parking.But how come the five PCNs show BN’s car was clocked in various parts of London: in Tooting, North Finchley and a housing estate. Ebeling, who has paid the fines, did not respond.Ebeling promised VMS and me that both cars would be returned two weeks ago. They weren’t.BN finally got his car back a week ago, nine months after it was taken, with 46 extra miles on the clock.NC was promised hers this week, but on the day of delivery was informed that Cobra had lost the keys. It was returned the following afternoon.Both drivers suspect that without press intervention they would still be waiting.Explore more on these topicsMoneyConsumer championsConsumer affairsConsumer rightsMotoringfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In contrast, men needed to reach 530 minutes, or nearly nine hours, a week to see the same effect.The study builds on previous work that suggests women benefit more than men from the same amount of exercise, but that women are generally less physically active and less likely to meet recommended exercise targets.UnderNHS guidelines, men and women aged 16 to 64 should take at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, each week, combined with muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.But the latest work stresses the need for tailored advice for men and women, and highlights the substantial health benefits women can achieve with only moderate amounts of exercise. Globally, one in three women die of cardiovascular disease.“Compared with male individuals, females derive equivalent health benefits with only half the exercise time,” the authors write inNature Cardiovascular Research. “The findings might have potential to encourage females to engage in physical activity,” they add.Dr Jiajin Chen at Xiamen University in China and his colleagues analysed data from activity trackers worn by middle-aged volunteers enrolled in theUK Biobank project. They first looked at 80,243 participants who did not have coronary heart disease. In this group, women who met the 150-minute weekly exercise target had a 22% lower risk of developing heart disease over eight years of follow-up, compared with those who did not. For men, the risk was 17% lower.Further analysis showed that women could reduce their heart disease risk by 30% through exercising for 250 minutes a week, a benefit men only achieved on reaching 530 minutes of physical activity each week.The most striking result emerged from data on more than 5,000 men and women who already had coronary heart disease. Here, the researchers found that the risk of dying during the follow-up period was three times lower for women who met the weekly exercise target than for similarly active men.New AI tool can predict a person’s risk of more than 1,000 diseases, say expertsRead moreProf Yan Wang, a senior author on the paper, said the work showed both sexes could gain “substantial cardiovascular benefits” from physical activity and recommended everyone, regardless of their sex, to take regular exercise.But he added that, globally, more women than men were not meeting physical activity targets. “We particularly hope that our findings could encourage physically inactive females to become more active, thereby reducing their cardiovascular risk,” he said.It is unclear why exercise may benefit women more than men, but scientists point to differences in sex hormones, muscle fibres and the ability to break down sugar to produce energy as potential factors.In anaccompanying article, Dr Emily Lau, a women’s cardiovascular health specialist at Massachusetts General hospital, writes: “This study provides further evidence that one size really does not fit all and challenges us to move from conversation to action. It is time to embed sex-specific strategies into guidelines and to develop tailored interventions to optimise cardiovascular health for women.”Explore more on these topicsHealthHeart diseaseWomen's healthMen's healthMedical researchFitnessnewsShareReuse this content"

After Marple, everything turned green as the valleys narrowed. It was a classic northern autumn day: the clouds were low, the mizzle and mist were closing in and the world was grey-filtered but for the glow of dead leaves all around.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.South-east of Manchester is a bit of an unknown for me. Between the city and the Derbyshire borough of High Peak, you don’t quite enter national park territory, but it’s nonetheless a charming and eye-calming landscape. TheMancunian Kinder Scout trespassers of 1932probably came this way, as do Pennine Way-farers bound for Edale. But the region is also post-industrial and close to conurbations. The Steel Cotton Rail Trail, whichofficially launched earlier this monthafter several years of planning, hopes to bring together elements of the land and the heritage while also drawing walkers and cyclists to areas of the Peak District perhaps ignored by those who rush for the main spine of the Pennines.Map of the trailThe 62-mile (100km) trail has been split into 14 day-friendly sections between the rail termini at Manchester and Sheffield, with stops along theHope Valley Linemarking the start and end points. There’s something for everyone. Urban explorers will enjoy the metropolitan mooches at either end, summit fiends will love the middle hill and moor sections, while those with young families or old dogs can opt for canal and riverside walks.I was the only passenger to alight at Chinley, a small, smartish-looking village in the Blackbrook valley. I soon found a sticker to show that I was on the right track; way marking is now complete along the route. I also had printouts of the handy pdf maps posted on the website. GPX files are available, but I didn’t want to spend the day looking phone-ward.View image in fullscreenEdale to Chinley on the Steel Cotton Rail Trail.The route, sloping downward, took me past a cafe and on to thePeak Forest Tramway Trail. As anyone who has been out on a recent country walk will know, 2025 has been a mast year, with an abundance of fruit and nuts falling from trees. I could hear the loud crunch of dry acorns and beech nuts as I began my walk towards the west.The tramway – serviced by horse and gravity-powered vehicles – opened in 1796 and carried on operating right up till the 1920s. Limestone, quarried all around the area, was taken out along these tracks. While much of the primary and heavy industrial plant has gone, I passed a polymer factory close to Chinley and I was rarely far from traffic (the mighty A6, England’s longest road once upon a time, was just beyond the curtain of trees) or light industrial units. Some people probably prefer the illusion of “real nature” but I like ambling through parts of the countryside where work and wilderness rub along. Anyway, I was always able to look down and let the golds, reds and ochres of leaf litter blur my ruminations.Some prefer the illusion of ‘real nature’ but I like ambling through parts of the countryside where work and wilderness rub alongSoon I came toBugsworth Basinon the Peak Forest canal – once the largest and busiest inland port on the canal system and the only one to survive intact. An information sign alluded to “canal mania”, the period between 1790 and the 1810s when dozens of cuts were made across England and Wales by speculators banking on “faster” logistics. In 1808, workers shifted sufficient limestone to fill 2,000 canal boats. A vital raw material, it was used in buildings, chemical manufacturing and agriculture. Limestone historians will probably challenge the steel and cotton of the trail’s name – cities edging out town and country, as ever – but you could also make a case for calling it the Millstone Grit Trail or the Coal Trail; this part of the world produced so much for Victorian Britain.I swerved right, joining the River Goyt. Despite its guttural name, the Goyt is a lovely river. It threads a pastoral squiggle from soggy moorland just east of Macclesfield all the way to Stockport, where it runs into the Mersey. As well as the new trail, I was also walking on sections of theGoyt Wayand a long-distance path called theMidshires Way. The path passed close to Furness Vale station on the Manchester-Buxton line – an alternative railway option to get to this section of the trail.View image in fullscreenThe Torrs Millennium walkway along the river Goyt in New Mills, Derbyshire.Photograph: Washington Imaging/AlamyIt was a mellow, easy walk all the way to New Mills, a town I only knew hitherto as the home town of punk/Oi! band Blitz, but which is a very dramatic constellation of magnificent bridges and stone viaducts, vertiginous gorges, fast-flowing water, the oldest community-owned hydro scheme in the land, some lovely llamas in a bosky paddock, and the sweeping steel Millennium Walkway. I’d passed a couple of rural pubs already, but New Mills has plenty of food and drink for those stopping or pausing here.I continued along the canyon – pastTorr Vale Mill, the UK’s longest-running textile mill till its closure in 2000 – and used the Goyt Way to enter Mousley Bottom nature reserve, a pretty patch of woodland occupying an area previously used as a landfill site, gasworks and sewage works.For an autumn amble, the 14 new walks are almost perfect and where you will catch several of the moods of this magical seasonI left the river behind at Hague Bar, and headed for Strines, to complete my two-stage, 6.5-mile walk, where I knew the train was hourly (it’s half-hourly from the larger stations). As fate would have it, just when I needed to speed up, the path went up too – quite sharply, in fact, as it ascended a green lane. After all the level walking, the views were suddenly much bigger, and the mist had burned off too. I was half-tempted by theFox Inn, a Robinsons’ pub in the tiny hamlet of Brookbottom, but given my now terrible thirst, bursting lungs and the one-hour wait, I knew the rest stop could easily morph into a three-pint siesta-inducer. So, I struggled on and actually jogged down to Strines to make the train for Piccadilly with three minutes to spare.View image in fullscreenThe Fox Inn in Brookbottom near New Mills.Photograph: John Fryer/AlamyThis new rail-pegged walking (and, along many sections, cycling) trail will be welcome in Manchester, where it links up nicely with the also quite new 200-mile orbitalGM Ringway. It may also tempt Sheffielders to look beyond the obvious Edale-Kinder Scout hikes – though Edale is a start/finish point for a nice 7.5-mile leg of the Steel Cotton Rail Trail. More frequent, reliable trains would make these walking trails really attractive. But for an autumn amble, the 14 new walks are almost perfect. Choose your challenge and altitude, decide whether you want trees or moors, towns or fields, and you will catch several of the moods of this magical season.Read more about and download guides at theSteel Cotton Rail TrailExplore more on these topicsTravelUnited Kingdom holidaysEngland holidaysEurope holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingRail travelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What desperation drove early humans to think, “Time to smash open this forbidding, rock-like blob and eat whatever godforsaken, gelatinous mess it disgorges”?Well, younger diners don’t agree – they’ve gone mad for oysters. They’re “cool” now, according to the Times: one vendor says sales are up 10% on last year, and oyster bars and market stalls are generating the kind of queues normally seen at Chappell Roan gigs and matcha pop-ups.How can they afford it? Oysters cost the earth, don’t they?Historically, oysters were cheap as chips – a working-class staple of the 18th and 19th centuries. They are dearer now, but bars’oyster “happy hours”, at which you can get them for £1 apiece, are very popular.I still don’t get it – you can get tastier, more filling and Instagrammable food for less than that.Well, it’s a trend, perhaps partially attributable to influencer and oyster obsessiveGeorgiana Davies– she boggles young minds by eating vast numbers, including 70 for breakfast at one happy hour.Seventy!

But when things go wrong, they go extremely wrong. “You can get very sick from eating raw oysters,” theUS Center for Disease Control warns.There’s a risk of infection, from the likes ofnorovirus, or worse – the potentially deadly vibrio bacteria.Deadly? I thought they just gave you a dodgy tummy.A vibrio vulnificus infection can lead to limb amputation and even death: two people in Louisiana died this summer after eating contaminated oysters.This confirms all my prejudices about oysters.And yet people keep coming back. As chef Richard Corrigan said to the Times, “It’s a brave person indeed, the person who puts an oyster in their mouth, but after that really, the passion hits you.”“Passion”, eh?They’re said to be an aphrodisiac– maybe the youth are hoping to revive their notoriouslyflagging sex lives?Oysters do contain lots of zinc, which isimportant for male sexual functionespecially, but it’s probably a stretch to say they boost libido.Pfff.

Science suggests that the former is the case.“Our body changes how it handles alcohol as we age,” says Adam Taylor, professor of anatomy at Lancaster medical school. The main reason is declining liver function.“Alcohol is metabolised in the liver,” says Taylor. “The liver’s primary function is to detoxify things – break them down and make them into usable units of currency for the body, or get rid of them if they’re harmful.”As we get older, toxic byproducts of alcohol linger in the bodyThe liver breaks down alcohol with the help of enzymes, but as we get older it produces fewer of them, meaning toxic byproducts such as acetaldehyde – the compound responsible for many hangover symptoms – linger in the body.It’s not just the liver. The body’s water content drops by about 5% after the age of 55, partly because levels of muscle, where a lot of it is stored, decrease. Less water means alcohol is more concentrated in the bloodstream, and dehydration caused by its diuretic qualities – a key culprit behind hangover headaches and grogginess – hits harder.Kidney function also declines with age, slowing the removal of waste products. “You get this buildup of waste products in the body that have a longer circulating time to exert their effects,” says Taylor.Can you prevent hangovers getting worse? No. But, if you do drink alcohol, alternating alcoholic drinks with water and sticking to recommended weekly limits can help.Once a hangover strikes, there’s no magic cure. “Time is the only thing that will fix it,” says Taylor. “Time, water and paracetamol.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleIs it true that …AlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But those who appeared on the ballot on Saturday – the former first lady Simone Gbagbo and three former ministers Jean-Louis Billon, Ahoua Don Mello and Henriette Lagou Adjoua – were unable to make headway.‘Dare to change’: Ivory Coast heads to the polls as rivals seek to oust OuattaraRead moreThe result trumps Ouattara’s winning margins in his previous three victories, including his 2015 win, when he secured 83% of the vote. Lagou Adjoua, who also contested in 2015, improved her previous record of 0.89% by getting 1.15%.On Sunday evening, Billon, a former trade minister, congratulated Ouattara in a concession statement on social media, saying his decision had been informed by partial results he had seen. Billon ended up being runner-up with 3% of the tally.Barring any surprise from the Constitutional Council during the stipulated five-day period, the octogenarian, who has been in office since 2011, will lead the world’s largest cocoa producer until 2030. Ouattara has supervised high economic growth rates and vast infrastructural development, but has been accused of crony capitalism and a clampdown on opposition to his rule.Despite 8.7 million people being registered to vote, the election was marked by low turnout in urban areas, especially within the commercial capital of Abidjan. At multiple polling units in the densely populated communes of Yopougon and Cocody, officials said fewer than 50 voters had come in by midday.The CEI said turnout was approximately 50%.Some observers said the low turnout inadvertently led to what has been the country’s most peaceful election in years. In 2010, after the former president Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat to Ouattara, a deadlock ensued that led to the death of an estimated 3,000 people in the months that followed. Ten years later, more than 50 people were killed as Ouattara secured a controversial third mandate.Before the vote, there had been tensions as youths ransacked the electoral commission’s office in Yamoussoukro, the political capital, leading the authorities to declare a curfew from 10pm to 6am on the eve of the election and after voting ended. Earlier this month, more than 250 protesters were arrested, with 32 handed three-year sentences, leaving the country on edge.Human rights groups had also noted the heavy deployment of security personnel before and during the election, raising alarm about the sidelining of prominent opposition figures and a clampdown on dissent.Explore more on these topicsIvory CoastAlassane OuattaraAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

A ban on public gatherings has been in effect since the day of the election and many businesses remain closed for fear of unrest. In the economic capital, Douala, there have been widespread complaints about internet restrictions that Camtel, the state operator, has blamed on a “technical incident”.View image in fullscreenOpposition supporters protested in Douala on Sunday, with clashes between demonstrators and police that left four people dead.Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/ReutersFour people were killed on Sunday in clashes between security forces and supporters of the opposition in Douala.Within hours of the official announcement, Tchiroma wrote on Facebook that two people had been killed after shots were fired at civilians outside his home in the northern city of Garoua. He gave no other details and the incident has yet to be independently verified.“Shooting point-blank at your own brothers – I can’t help but wonder if you’re mercenaries,” he posted. “Kill me if you want, but I will liberate this country by any means necessary. What blatant impunity.”Tchiroma had claimed victory two days after the election, which took place on 12 October, publishing a tally that showed he had secured 54.8 % of the votes, to Biya’s 31.3%. His team said his victory was based on results representing 80% of the electorate that they had collated.He also called for protests if the constitutional council were to announce “falsified and distorted results”. The ruling Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement dismissed his claims, urging him to wait for the official results.View image in fullscreenIssa Tchiroma Bakary, of the Cameroon National Salvation Front (FSNC), said he would ‘liberate this country by any means necessary’.Photograph: Desire Danga Essigue/ReutersThe situation has been particularly volatile in Tchiroma’s home town of Garoua, where youths on motorcycles gathered with crude weapons outside his residence in anticipation of his possible arrest.There have also been protests in the capital, Yaoundé, as well as in neighbourhoods in other parts of Cameroon including Bafoussam and Douala, two of the country’s most populous cities. In a video posted on social media at the weekend, Tchiroma claimed security personnel had attempted to breach his residence to arrest him.Biya is only the second head of state to lead Cameroon since independence from France in 1960. He has ruled with an iron fist, repressing all political and armed opposition, and holding on to power through social upheaval, economic disparity and separatist violence.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsCameroonAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It then released a statement saying it had “extended control over the city of El Fasher from the grip of mercenaries and militias”.The Popular Resistance, a local pro-army militia, responded on Sunday that the army was in “more fortified positions” and that residents were still “resisting in the face of terrorist militias”.The UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher,said he was “deeply alarmed”by reports of fighters pushing further into the city and cutting off escape routes, calling for an immediate ceasefire, access for humanitarian aid and safe passage for civilians who wanted to leave.Map of El FasherMap of El FasherHowever, the RSF said it was committed to providing “safe corridors for all those who wish to move to other locations, as well as the necessary protection for all those in the city”.Sudan has been torn apart by civil warsince April 2023, when a power struggle between the military and the RSF descended into open warfare in the capital, Khartoum, and spread rapidly across the country.On thesecond anniversary of the start of the conflict, more than 13 million people had been displaced and half the 51 million population needed food aid.Although Sudan’s armyrecaptured Khartoumin March 2025, enabling many residents to return, fighting has continued to rage in the country’s south and west. In May 2024, the RSF laid siege to El Fasher, in the western Darfur region.In August, theUN said more than 600,000 people had been displacedfrom the city, while 260,000 still trapped there were cut off from aid.Videos showed RSF fighters celebrating in front of the El Fasher garrison, which had been abandoned by the army. Others circulating online, which could not be independently verified, appeared to show the RSF berating a group of men seated on the ground, accusing them of being soldiers, and RSF vehicleschasing people fleeing.El FasherA telecommunications blackout and Starlink satellite internet outages are severely limiting access to independent information from El Fasher. However, according to people who had managed to leave the city whospoke to Sky News, some people who tried to flee were killed by the RSF.Meanwhile, the Sudanese Journalists Syndicateexpressed concernover the arrest of Muammar Ibrahim, noting that videos showing the reporter surrounded by RSF fighters had gone viral on social media and demanding his “immediate and unconditional release”.If the RSF’s capture of the city is confirmed, it would mean the militia – led by the warlordMohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti – controls all five of Darfur’s states. Analysts have warned that this could herald the effective partition of Sudan.Map of SudanMap of SudanDagalo was sworn in as head of the RSF’s parallel government in August, in the city of Nyala. The militia also increased theintensity of the siege of El Fasher.This month, RSF drone and artillery strikeskilled at least 60 peoplein a displacement shelter in the city.Sudan’s military government hasaccused the United Arab Emiratesof supplying arms to the RSF, which the Emiratis have denied. In April, a leaked UN experts report found “multiple” flights from the UAE where transport planes made apparently deliberate attempts to avoid detection as they flew into bases in Chad, where arms smuggling across the border into Darfur has been monitored.View image in fullscreenChildren displaced by RSF attacks in Tawila, North Darfur.Photograph: ReutersThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Monday that there was “more and more an external interference” that was undermining the path to a ceasefire and political solution to Sudan’s civil war.“It’s high time for the international community to talk clearly, to all countries that are interfering in this war, and that are providing weapons to the parties to the war, to stop doing that,” Guterres told a press conference on the sidelines of the Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur.He added: “It is clear that … it is not only a Sudanese problem, with the army and Rapid Support Forces fighting each other.”Sudan’s army and the RSF have been accused of committing war crimes in the civil war. The RSF and allied militias have attacked non-Arab ethnic groups in Darfur, with fighters saying they wouldforce women to have “Arab babies”, according to a UN report published in November 2024.The RSF grew out of theJanjaweed Arab militias, which were accused of committing genocideunder the orders of former president Omar al-Bashirin Darfur in 2003.In January, the US governmentformally declared that the RSF had committed genocide.Agence France Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDarfurSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Authorities fear it will unleash catastrophic flooding, landslides and extensive infrastructure damage.In the south-western parish of St Elizabeth, winds are already becoming ferocious, with one tree falling on to electricity poles and knocking out power.The parish also borne the brunt ofHurricane Beryl, which caused historic levels of destruction in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada and Jamaica last year. Some people say they have only recently completed work on their properties after Beryl.mapThe director of the Meteorological Service of Jamaica, Evan Thompson, has warned that no part of the island is likely be spared Melissa’s deadly combination of rapid intensification and snail-paced advance.“If it continues as projected in terms of the turn toward the island, we should therefore on Tuesday look for the hurricane-force winds starting to impact southern coastal areas and then gradually spreading as the system moves closer to the coastline,” he said.He said the rapid strengthening of the hurricane was notable: “That is something that would not always happen, and this is usually indicative of the kind of warm waters that we’re experiencing that we believe is somewhat related to climate change.”graphicDesrick Kenton, who lives in Portland on the north-east coast, said the rattling of his zinc roof persuaded him to head to a shelter. Asked why he thought some people were refusing to move, he said: “The spirit of God has to touch some of the people before they move. But I tell them despite the fact you may have a concrete structure it doesn’t matter, if you are living in a low-lying area, sort out yourself and move out to the best shelter.”Leslie Burton, a farmer who also lives in Portland, has been without power. “Some of the little things in my refrigerator I have to dispose of and my neighbours are in the same problem,” he said, adding that he was concerned about his animals.“I tried to put some zinc [coverings] over them but the breeze blew them away,” he said. He said he had to find a way to protect them, because they are his livelihood. “I do all the preparations even for my house but now I just have to hope for the best,” he said.Maria Douglas, a shop owner in Portland, is also without electricity. “My ice-cream is melting. I have to be giving them away as well as drinks. The meat is still frozen but I’m not sure how long those will last, so it’s gonna be a big loss. We didn’t expect the electricity to go off so early otherwise we could have been better organised.”Ava Brown, an author and publisher who ownsthe Black River film festival, is in St Elizabeth, which is expected to be one of the worst-affected areas. She said that despite taking every possible precaution, she was scared. “I am a single mom so I had one of my neighbours help me to batten down my windows. We had to move certain things away from the house.,” she said. “I’m really scared. It’s scary because, for example, you worry about how to ration the food.”Jason Henzell, the chair of Jakes hotel in Treasure Beach, a popular tourist destination, said he decided to leave his St Elizabeth home and relocate his family to Kingston as he saw the effects of the storm.Henzell said that despite his efforts to “lead by example” and encourage other residents to leave the area and seek shelter elsewhere, some have chosen to remain.“Jamaicans are very deep in their faith. And I don’t say that as a means of mockery. I mean it with a tremendous amount of sincerity and respect. So, as a people, we (tend) to think that we can pray something away. And for the most part, we have been spared. So there is a feeling as though the Lord is going to protect us. He’s going to take [the hurricane] into a different direction. And that faith and belief has saved us on many occasions. But you know … at some point, the luck is going to run out, the blessings are going to run out. And I just, I hope and pray this is not that day, but it is looking like it is that day.”Category 5 is the highest on the Saffir-Simpson scale with sustained winds exceeding 157mph (250km/h). The chief meteorologist at AccuWeather, Jonathan Porter, said Melissa would be the strongest hurricane in recorded history to hit Jamaica directly.He said critical infrastructure including the island’s main international airport and power plants was located along the coast in Kingston, where a storm surge of up to 4 metres (13ft) was expected.“This can become a true humanitarian crisis very quickly, and there is likely going to be the need for a lot of international support,” he said.One of the main concerns for Jamaican officials is getting people in low-lying and flood-prone areas on the coast and elsewhere into almost 900 shelters.The country’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, announced late on Sunday that he had signed a compulsory evacuation order for several communities along the south coast, which will empower the country’sOffice of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Managementto remove people from high-risk areas after some refused to leave.Residents in Port Royal, a small fishing village in Kingston,saidat the weekend they did not want to move because they would not feel safe in shelters where their belongings could be stolen and women could be at risk.View image in fullscreenA Port Royal resident awaits the arrival of Hurricane Melissa.Photograph: Octavio Jones/ReutersBefore a 1692 earthquake submerged most of Port Royal, it was one of the biggest cities in theCaribbean. Today it is considered one of the communities most vulnerable to hurricanes and is on the compulsory evacuation list.Jamaica’s health minister, Christopher Tufton, said people who refused to move risked putting more pressure on already vulnerable healthcare services.“The concerns are more with the people who are not evacuating,” he said. “But generally, we do have some vulnerabilities in some of our institutions. We have about three hospitals that are close to the coast – Falmouth, Black River and Hanover. They are right on the shoreline, on the coastline. So those could see some flooding if a surge is high enough.” There were plans to evacuate patients to higher ground if necessary, he said.On Monday morning local time, Melissa was about 135 miles (220km) south-west of Kingston and about 320 miles south-west of Guantánamo in Cuba, the US National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had maximum sustained wind speeds of 160mph and was moving west at 3mph, the agency said.Some parts of eastern Jamaica could receive up to a metre (40in) of rain while western Haiti could get 40cm (16in), it said. “Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely.”Explore more on these topicsJamaicaHurricanesExtreme weatherAmericasCaribbean (Weather)Caribbean (World news)newsShareReuse this content"

The storm’s winds escalated from 70mph to 140mph in just a day, one of the fastest intensifications on record in the Atlantic Ocean.On Monday morning, the US’s National Hurricane Center upgraded Melissa further to a category 5 storm, with winds of up to 160mph (260km/h). The hurricane is inching slowly towards Jamaica, where it is feared it will cause catastrophic flooding and landslides, before crossing Cuba and the Bahamas by Wednesday.Hurricane Melissa strengthens to category 5 as evacuations ordered in Jamaica’s capitalRead moreScientists say this is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification of its wind speed and power. This sort of intensification has been linked to the human-caused climate crisis, which is causing oceans to become hotter.“That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now – around 30C [86F], which is 2 to 3C above normal,” said Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, in the United Kingdom. “And it’s not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.”Last year, the world’s oceans were thewarmest on record, continuing a recent trend of record-breaking marine heat. Climate Central, a climate non-profit, hassaidthat the extra heat in the Atlantic has been made about 700 times more likely due to the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation and other human activities.“Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather,” said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, a US-based research group.“It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,” she added.A 2023studyhad found that Atlantic hurricanes are now more than twice as likely as before to intensify rapidly from minor storms to powerful and catastrophic events.Climate scientists have long warned that warming oceans – driven by greenhouse gas emissions – are making such explosive storm development more common. “We’re living in a warmer world, and that means hurricanes are more likely to intensify quickly, especially near coastlines,” Deoras said.The impact of climate change is putting lives at risk on islands and in coastal areas, Placky said. “With 90% of our extra heat going into our oceans, we’re seeing these oceans warm and they’re rising. And that plays out with sea level rise. So even outside of any storm, the water levels are getting higher. They’re creeping away at our coastlines and they’re going farther inland,” she said.A storm like Melissa only compounds these impacts, according to Placky. “These storms are really ripping away at the coastal infrastructure of these islands,” she said.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) predicted a busier-than-usual Atlantic hurricane season this year, with 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine hurricanes and two to five major hurricanes. After a slow start, that has been largely accurate so far.The Associated Press contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsHurricanesJamaica (World news)Jamaica (Weather)AmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Trump stepped in after that humiliating result, offeringa $20bn (£15bn) currency swap dealand a further $20bn in support for an economy he claimed was “dying” – although the US president indicated such “generosity” would evaporate if Milei failed to win big on Sunday.Milei’s opponents accused Trump of flagrantly meddling in Argentina’s electoral process with his explicit message to voters. Some predicted an anti-Trump backlash, similar to the one felt in neighbouring Brazil as a result ofWashington’s ham-fisted attemptto force its authorities to abandon the coup trial of the former president Jair Bolsonaro.But on Sunday night there was scant sign of voter reprisals over Trump’s intervention. If anything, some suspected the gambit might have paid off by swaying voters’ minds.Diego Guelar, an Argentinian politician and former ambassador to China and the US, voiced unease at how Trump had warned voters “they had to vote for his friend [Milei] or he would abandon them”. But Guelar thought the US president’s “direct intervention”, while “awful”, had worked, with voters accepting “the need for American assistance” and blaming the economic crisis on the opposition.Brian Winter, anArgentinaexpert who edits the Americas Quarterly magazine, said: “It has the appearance of a masterstroke by Donald Trump. He threw a lifeline to somebody who was drowning at just the right moment.”Milei’s libertarian party, La Libertad Avanza (Liberty Advances), captured nearly 41% of the vote – considerably higher than expected after a miserable spell of corruption scandals and growing economic crisis – compared with his Peronist rivals’ 32%. Argentina’s bonds, stocks and currency, the peso, surged on Monday as Milei celebrated what he called a vindication of his two-year-old “shock therapy” crusade.Winter was still trying to gauge the extent to which Trump’s $40bn rescue package – andpre-election admonition– had affected the result, which underlined how many voters still blamed the Peronists for years of economic chaos, even if they were increasingly disillusioned with Milei.“But the way politics works, Trump will get credit for this,” Winter predicted. “It looks like a bold bet – and not just a bold bet. The appearance, at least, is that he [Milei] showed the value of being an ally to Donald Trump. And this is a White House that is making more use of carrots and sticks in Latin America than any White House in probably 50 years.”Trump’s unexpectedly intense focus on Latin America – which also includes the highly controversial naval buildup off Venezuela’s coast,accusing Mexico’s leadersof narco ties, threateningto forcibly “take back” the Panama canal, and slapping 50% tariffs on Brazil – may not, beyond Milei’s movement, be winning him many friends in the region.But Winter believed it was, for better or worse, influencing people: “He has helped cajole the Mexicans into a more active approach on security and migration. He has convinced the Panamanians to push the Chinese out of the proximity of the canal. He appears to have backtracked on a failing strategy in Brazil – and now both sides are talking about a significant deal on rare earths, critical minerals and potentially other areas.”Trump’s distinctly 19th-century-style doctrine – “rescue packages and loans for his friends and gunboat diplomacy for his enemies” – could easily backfire over time, Winter admitted. “But for now, most of them are producing results.”Above all for Milei, now Trump’s best regional friend, who used X to thank his North American underwriter as the scale of Sunday’s victory became clear.“You are a great friend of the Argentine Republic,” Argentina’s president told Trump, before signing off with a rallying cry they now share: “Maga.”Additional reporting by Facundo IglesiaExplore more on these topicsJavier MileiArgentinaAmericasDonald TrumpUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

The Peronist opposition, Fuerza Patria, secured 31.7%.The Peronists remain the largest bloc by three seats. But when Milei’s party is combined with the centre-right PRO party of the former president Mauricio Macri – which has voted with the government over the past two years – the president now has a larger bloc than the opposition to push through his libertarian policies.Milei’s victory has surprised Argentine analysts and many say that even the government itself did not expect such an overwhelming result, given the recent blows to the libertarian’s popularity fromcorruption allegations involving his sisterand the current economic crisis.The government had played down expectations, considering anything between 30% and 35% a satisfactory outcome, especially after Milei’s heavy defeat in the provincial elections in Buenos Aires in September, when he lost to the Peronists by 14 percentage points.View image in fullscreenSupporters of the Peronist coalition Fuerza Patria after the election results were announced.Photograph: Martin Cossarini/ReutersThis time, Milei’s party turned the tide, winning in Argentina’s largest electoral district, home to about 40% of the electorate.“I am the king of a lost world,” Milei sang as he took the stage in front of hundreds of supporters at a hotel in Buenos Aires. He began his speech by saying: “Today we passed the tipping point – the construction of a great Argentina begins.”The president hailed the US bailout as “something unprecedented, not only in Argentine history but in world history, because the US has never offered support of such magnitude”.“Now we are focused on carrying out the reforms that Argentina needs to consolidate growth and the definitive takeoff of the country – to make Argentina great again,” the president said.View image in fullscreenA woman holds a sign critical of the Trump-Milei relationship.Photograph: Emiliano Lasalvia/AFP/Getty ImagesTrump offered his congratulations on Sunday night, calling the win for Milei’s party a “landslide victory”.On Monday, Trump said: “He had a lot of help from us. He had a lot of help. I gave him an endorsement, a very strong endorsement,” Trump said, also crediting some of his top officials, including the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, who oversaw the financial assistance to Argentina. “We are sticking with a lot of the countries in South America. We focus very much on South America.”For the political scientist Miguel de Luca, Trump’s support was decisive in preventing the country’s economy from deteriorating further in recent weeks. “But I don’t think it influenced voters’ decisions,” he said.Marketsreacted sharplyto the surprise victory: shares rose more than 40% in pre-market trading and the Merval index posting its biggest one-day jump in 30 years, up almost 32%. Dollar-denominated sovereign bonds climbed as much as 23%. The result is being seen as a renewed wave of optimism that Milei’s austerity plan and the US bailout could succeed.View image in fullscreenCardboard cutouts depicting Milei and Trump in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Photograph: Matías Baglietto/NurPhoto/ShutterstockUp for grabs in the election were 127 of the 257 seats in the lower house and a third of the senate, 24 of its 72 seats. Milei’s party secured 64 lower house seats and 13 in the senate.The new seats in the lower house, combined with those already held, allow the government to meet its main goal for this election: securing at least a third of the lower house to sustain presidential vetoes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst ThingFree daily newsletterOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Midterms in Argentina are typically setbacks for sitting presidents, and he is only the third to have achieved a better result than when first elected.Even with a working majority when his party is combined with PRO, Milei still needs about 20 more deputies to pass laws and reforms – meaning he will have to negotiate with governors outside his coalition, who wield significant influence over members of congress.“Milei comes out stronger from the election and wins a second chance,” said De Luca. “It remains to be seen whether he takes advantage of it by opening negotiations with moderate governors or continues with his ‘governing alone’ style, without allies.”Milei began his administration almost two years ago with his “chainsaw” spending cuts,slashing tens of thousands of public jobsand freezing investment in infrastructure, healthcare, education and even the supply of medicines for pensioners.He managed to bring down inflation from more than 200% in 2023 to about 30% in September, and achieved the country’s first fiscal surplus in 14 years. Economic activity grew by 0.3% in August 2025 after three consecutive months of decline.But purchasing power has plummeted: most Argentinians say they are struggling to make ends meet, more than 250,000 jobs have been lost and about 18,000 businesses have closed.The libertarian’s popularity also took a hit when Milei promoted a cryptocurrency that later collapsed;his sister and most powerful cabinet member, Karina Milei, wasimplicated in an alleged corruption scheme; and one of his party’s leading candidates withdrew from Sunday’s election after admitting to having received $200,000 from a businessman accused of drug trafficking in the US.View image in fullscreenKarina Milei, the president’s sister, is also his most powerful cabinet member.Photograph: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty ImagesTo prevent the peso from devaluing, the government burned through its dollar reserves, even after taking a $20bn loan (of which $14bn has been disbursed) from the International Monetary Fund, and was forced to turn to Trump, who came to the rescue with a $40bn bailout.Trump’s stance was seen by many in the country as interference in the election, and some predicted that – owing to anti-American sentiment among parts of the population – it could backfire on Milei.Although voting is compulsory, turnout was the lowest since the return to democracy in 1983, at 67.85%, surpassing the previous record low of 71% set in 2021.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaJavier MileiAmericasUS foreign policyDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Does the West have a muscle and resilience, when the autocrats and dictators think they can wage war for another year, and the democratic countries will become fed up?“No. We have to show that we are even more putting stronger support against violence. It’s not only onUkraine. It’s against violence, against war, and that’s a signal also for China and the Indo-Pacific area.”Finland is ready for the next crisis, with stockpiled food and 72-hour kits – Europe should be too | Miika IlomäkiRead moreEnding the Ukraine conflict required a three-pillar approach, he said: tougher sanctions on the Russian economy and energy exports; stronger military assistance to Ukraine; and the use of long-range weapons to destroy factories for drones and missiles.But Trump has resisted pressure to allow Ukraine to use American Tomahawk cruise missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia. Despite lobbying from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and calls for long-range capabilities on Friday from the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, Trump has argued the weapons are too complex and require years of training.View image in fullscreenChina is aiding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by giving them military components and industrial cooperation, Häkkänen says.Photograph: Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesHäkkänen said any weakness in resolve would embolden China.“If there will be some kind of military conflict in the Indo-Pacific area, caused by China, Russia will be somehow involved, through supporting China or something like that,” he said.“We see now that Russia, by their own resources, cannot continue this kind of warfare, but China is helping them a great deal. They are giving a lot of money to support their economy, from energy exports, and giving them a lot of military components and industrial cooperation.”Finland shares a land border of more than 1,300km with Russia and considers Putin a permanent threat to European security. The country joined the Nato alliance in 2023 and its president, Alexander Stubb, has secured close ties with Trump.Häkkänen said China’s president, Xi Jinping, should take note of the resolve shown by the global democratic alliance, including the “coalition of the willing”, of which Australia is a member.China considers Taiwan part of its territory and foreign policy experts believe Beijing is aiming to be capable of making a military move against its independence as early as 2027, amid increased military activity in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.While criticising countries not pulling their weight with Ukraine, Häkkänen said he was optimistic about possible peace.“European countries have in the last month or so chosen really good steps in supporting Ukraine, investing heavily in our own defence.”Cooperation on the war could have broader flow-on effects for Australia’s trade ties with Europe.Finland is seeking to expand defence industrial and space ties with Australia. Its political state secretary for foreign affairs, Pasi Rajala,has visited Australia and New Zealand in recent months.Häkkänen, who has met the defence minister, Richard Marles, said Australia had played a “tremendous” role as one of the biggest non-Nato contributors supporting Ukraine.“It’s a big political message here in Europe, that Australia has been a part of the support,” he said. “That will send the signal that if Australia has some challenges in security or defence, Europe knows that we have to be in the same family.”Tom McIlroy travelled to Finland as a recipient of the EU-Qantas journalism prizeExplore more on these topicsUkraineChinaRussiaVladimir PutinFinlandNatoAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Now, however, people in populated areas are being urged to learn how to protect themselves following a spate of attacks, as the animals leave their natural habitats in search of food.Bear encounters are generating almost daily headlines. In the past week in Akita prefecture, the animals attacked a jogger and a walker inbuilt-up areas, while another terrorised four people before holing up inside a nearby house. None of the victims was seriously injured.However, some encounters have been fatal: according to the environment ministry, nine people have died across the country since April – the highest annual total on record.Japan relaxes bear-shooting laws amid rise in attacksRead moreIn response, authorities and media are stepping up their advice on how toavoid a nasty encounter.The consensus is that anyone who finds themselves face to face with a bear should avoid eye contact and sudden movements, and back away slowly without turning their back on the animal. They should not attempt to run or scale a tree – feats that bears perform with far greater speed and agility than humans.If a mauling seems inevitable, experts advise victims to lie on the ground face down and protect their heads and necks.In a study released at the weekend, experts at Akita University said those measures tended to result in less serious injuries after surveying 70 people who had been injured in attacks in Akita prefecture – a bear hotspot. All seven of the respondents who had laid face down and used their hands to protect their head and neck escaped serious injury, the study said.Other preventative measures include carrying a bell or whistle while out walking, and staying in groups, since bears rarely approach multiple people. Repellent spray is considered the most effective precaution, but is not easily available inJapan. The list of don’ts includes hiking at dusk and dawn, when bears are at their most active, and never to discard food or other rubbish.There are an estimated 44,000 Asian black bears in Japan – found in many areas but particularly in the north – and 12,000 larger Ussuri brown bears, found on the northernmost island of Hokkaido.Changing behaviouramong Japan’s large and growing bear population is thought to be behind the surge in incidents, particularly in Hokkaido and other regions in the north.Hungry bears have been spotted in towns and villages – places they were once reluctant to roam – amid adecline in harvestsof acorns and beechnuts, according to experts.There is also evidence that warmer winters caused by theclimate crisisare forcing the animals to hibernate later than usual, which raises the likelihood of an encounter. And rural depopulation has created zones of overgrown farmland that blur the naturalsatoyamawoodland that separates mountains from villages.Akita and other local governments are struggling to address the surge in attacks, amid a shortage of licensed hunters. The prefecture’s governor, Kenta Suzuki, said on social media that he was considering asking Japan’s military – the self-defence forces – for help, according to the Kyodo news agency.The environment minister, Hirotaka Ishihara, last week called the rise in attacks a “serious problem”, telling reporters the government was committed to training more hunters and “managing the bear population”.Residents in areas that have experienced rises in bear attacks are taking matters into their own hands. One hardware store in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, has a section devoted to bells and whistles, while it is struggling to meet demand for repellent spray, which can be rented for up to five days, according to the public broadcaster NHK.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificWildlifeAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Their respective teams will start “immediately” to discuss tariffs and other matters, he said.An agreement between the US and China reduces the chances of an all out global trade war that threatened car production across Europe and the UK.It comes after months of escalated trade tensions between the two economic super-powers, triggered by Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcement outside the White House in April.With just days to go before their current tariff truce was due to end, Xi showed he had no intention of submitting to Trump’s threats of 100% tariffs.Instead he turned the screws on the US,imposing controls on exports of rare earth mineralsincluding magnets a critical element used for electronic window and boot openings in cars.Trump accused Beijing, which controls 60% of global production and 90% of the refineries of rare earths, of “becoming very hostile” and trying to hold the world “captive”.Beijing also hit the US agriculture sector hard, stopping buying soya beans from the US. China is the US’s biggest soya bean customer, importing half of all $24bn (£18bn) in exports in 2024.“I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,” Bessent told reporters after he and US trade representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng and Li for their fifth round of in-person discussions since May.Bessent said he anticipates that a tariff truce with China will be extended beyond its 1 November expiry date, and that China will revive substantial purchases of US soya beans after buying none in September and instead sourcing the crop from Brazil and Argentina.US soya bean farmers “will feel very good about what’s going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years” once the deal’s terms are announced, Bessent told ABC.Greer said both sides agreed to pause some punitive actions and found “a path forward where we can have more access to rare earths from China, we can try to balance out our trade deficit with sales from the United States.”Tensions between Brazil and the United States have also escalated since August when Trump increased tariffs on imports of most Brazilian goods to 50% from 10% in August.“We agreed that our teams will meet immediately to advance the search for solutions to the tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian authorities,” Lula said in a social media post after the meeting.Trump had linked the tariff move to what he called a “witch-hunt” against Jair Bolsonaro, the South American country’s former president.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpChinaXi JinpingTariffsAsia PacificInternational tradeTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The US lawsuit said evidence clearly disproved this “grotesque narrative”, which had become “a campaign of global humiliation” and “relentless bullying on a worldwide scale”.The French trial for online harassment is separate to the US court action and relates to a legal complaint filed byBrigitte Macronin 2024. Ten defendants – eight men and two women, aged 41 to 60 – are being tried in Paris’s criminal court, accused of online harassment targeting Brigitte Macron. If convicted, they face up to two years in prison.The defendants, who deny all wrongdoing, have been accused of making numerous malicious comments about Brigitte Macron’s gender and sexuality, even equating her age difference with her husband to “paedophilia”, according to prosecutors.The court heard Brigitte Macron had told police the online comments were “hateful” and that it was very hard for her grandchildren to hear it being said that their grandmother was a man.Jérôme A, a 49-year-old IT technician, was asked about nine social media posts in 2024, which he reposted or wrote, about Brigitte Macron being a man or having a penis. He told the court he had a relatively small Twitter account. He said: “It was just a joke … I wanted to be sarcastic, nothing more.” He added that he had posted “in a satirical spirit”.Jérôme A told the head judge: “Like a lot of people, I’m asking why I’m here today. Today, you can send people to court for tweets.”He said that Brigitte Macron, “as a very powerful person, should accept being criticised”. He denied harassment and said he believed he had not broken the law.Another defendant, Jérome C, a debt adviser, told the court he liked posting on social media from his sofa in the evening. “It was just humour,” he said. “Do you need a permit inFranceto crack a joke?”He also told the court that he had shared posts about Brigitte Macron being a man or a paedophile in order to “inform” others. He denied harassment.The Macrons’ US lawsuit has stated that the accusation that Brigitte Macron was born a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux is completely false and Trogneux is in fact Brigitte Macron’s 80-year-old brother. He lives in the northern French town of Amiens, where he grew up with Brigitte and four other Trogneux siblings in a family famous for its local chocolate business. He was present in public alongside Brigitte at Emmanuel Macron’s two presidential inaugurations in 2017 and 2022.Among the defendants, who have all denied wrongdoing, is Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, 41, a publicist known on social media as “Zoé Sagan” and often linked with conspiracy theory circles.View image in fullscreenAurélien Poirson-Atlan arrives at court on the first day of the cyberbullying trial.Photograph: Teresa Suárez/EPAThe defendants also include a woman already the subject of a defamation complaint filed by Brigitte Macron in 2022: Delphine J, 51, a self-proclaimed spiritual medium.In 2021, she posted a four-hour interview with the self-described independent journalist Natacha Rey on her YouTube channel, alleging that Brigitte Macron had once been a man called Jean-Michel Trogneux.The two women, who denied wrongdoing, were ordered to pay damages to Brigitte Macron and her brother in 2024 but their conviction was overturned on appeal. The appeal court verdict did not imply that the claims that Brigitte Macron is a man were true, but instead judges ruled that the case against the women did not fit the definition of defamation.Brigitte Macron and Jean-Michel Trogneux have taken the case to France’s highest appeals court, thecour de cassation.The Macrons’ relationship has long been a topic of comment online. Brigitte Macron, 24 years older than her husband, first met Emmanuel Macron when she was a French teacher at his Jesuit secondary school in Amiens, directing him in a school play.The Macrons’ US lawsuit stated: “Through the school’s theatre programme, president Macron and Mrs Macron formed a deeper intellectual connection.” It added: “At all times the teacher-student relationship between Mrs Macron and President Macron remained within the bounds of the law.”Brigitte Macron, who has three children from her first marriage, divorced in 2006. She and Emmanuel Macron married the following year, when he was 30.Explore more on these topicsBrigitte MacronEmmanuel MacronFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister said the deal would boost theNatoalliance, despite criticism of Turkey’s increasingly authoritarian administration.The deal was signed as Erdoğan’sjailed chief political opponent, Ekrem İmamoğlu, faced fresh charges including alleged links to British intelligence.The jet, also known as the Eurofighter, isa joint projectbetween the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain, and has been one of the Royal Air Force’s key aircraft for two decades, including in Iraq, andintercepting Russian planessince Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The order comes after the managing director of the Typhoon programme, Richard Hamilton, told reporters in July that hewas “really confident”of receiving export orders to preserve the Warton production line in Lancashire.Starmer described the deal as a landmark agreement and “a win for British workers, a win for our defence industry, and a win for Nato security”.BAE Systems will assemble Turkey’s jets in the UK and the first delivery is expected in 2030. The order will secure the jobs of about 500 workers at the company’s Warton site and benefit a facility making front fuselages at Samlesbury, 12 miles (20km) to the east. It will also give work to factories across Europe, where partner countries make sections of the aircraft.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan exchange copies of the agreement at the presidential complex in Ankara.Photograph: Necati Savaş/EPAThe UK’s desire to drum up export orders to help economic growth has, however, meant overlooking concerns about some of its buyers’ human rights records.Erdoğan’s critics have condemned the fresh charges against İmamoğlu as a blatant attempt to keep the president’s chief rival out of Turkish politics. The former mayor of Istanbulhas been in jail since Marchon corruption charges.İmamoğlu denied the latest charges, writing on X: “Such slander, lies and conspiracy wouldn’t even cross the devil’s mind. We are facing shameful immorality that can’t be described with words.”An Istanbul court has issued an arrest order against him and two others – Merdan Yanardağ, the editor-in-chief of the television news channel Tele1, and İmamoğlu’s former campaign manager Necati Özkan.The trio are accused of links with a fourth man, Hüseyin Gün, who in turn is accused of conducting espionage activities on behalf of foreign states, including holding meetings with theformer head of MI6 Richard Moore. Before running the UK overseas intelligence services, Moore was the UK ambassador to Turkey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That includes the threat of possible legal changes to criminalise same-sex marriage.“While negotiations on this multi-billion-pound sale take place, a massive crackdown on human rights is taking place in the country,” she said. “The main opposition party is facing relentless attacks. Its presidential candidate and mayor of Istanbul Ekrem İmamoğlu and his campaign director have also been remanded on ‘espionage’ charges.”A spokesperson for the prime minister said: “We have raised the arrests, including that of the Istanbul mayor and protesters, with the Turkish government at a number of levels. The UK is a staunch supporter of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.”Starmer focused on Turkey’s role as a Nato member amid increased concern about Russia’s plans. “At either ends ofEurope, the UK and Turkey are vital to tackling the challenges of our time and this will allow our armed forces to work even closer together as we deter threats and protect our national interests,” he said.The Typhoon is also operated by Austria, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The sale of the jet to Riyadh only came after Germany dropped concerns about human rights that were highlighted by the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. US intelligence agencies came to the conclusion that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman,had approved the murder.BAE’s chief executive, Charles Woodburn, said: “Typhoon is an export success story and demonstrates how investment in defence can fuel significant economic growth and returns across the UK. Today’s announcement extends Typhoon production and preserves crucial sovereign skills which underpin the UK’s defence and security.”Explore more on these topicsAerospace industryBAE SystemsForeign policyTurkeyEuropeHuman rightsNatonewsShareReuse this content"

In Roccaraso, a popular resort in Abruzzo’s Apennines that became overcrowded last season after beingpromoted by a TikTok star, the cost of a daily ski pass is expected to rise to €60.Meanwhile, the cost of seasonal ski passes will range from between €755 per adult in Roccaraso to as much as €1,800 in the Aosta valley.The cost of hiring ski equipment has also gone up, as have hotel and restaurant prices.Gabriele Melluso, the president of Assoutenti, said the price rises, which ski resort operators blame on higher energy prices, the cost of maintaining resorts and higher demand for better quality equipment, were “completely unjustified and unacceptable […] both because inflation in Italy is under control and energy tariffs, which had increased costs for ski resort operators in 2022, have returned to normal.”He added that prices were now so high that the less wealthy had been forced to forgo their traditionalsettimana bianca, or ski holiday, altogether.He noted a sharp decline in mountain tourism during the 2024-2025 season, with 1 million fewer Italians hitting the slopes compared with the previous year owing to the rising cost.Despite the price rises, Italy is still a cheaper place to ski in westernEuropethan Switzerland, France and Austria.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The aircraft … did not violate the borders of other states,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In exchange, Israel has agreed to hand over 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli.Hamas’s military wing, the al-Qassam brigades, said on Monday it would deliver the body of a deceased hostage at 9pm local time, Reuters reported. Israeli media confirmed the IDF was working with the Red Cross to receive the remains in the evening.Hamas has so far returned the remains of 15 of those held captive but some of the others are believed to be in areas beyond theyellow line marking the Israeli withdrawal. If the identity of the deceased hostage delivered on Monday is confirmed, it would mean the remains of 12 hostages remain in Gaza. Hamas says it faces obstacles to locating them in the rubble left by the bombardment.“At the request of the parties, the International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday accompanied a party to the conflict as the party searched for the remains of the deceased past the IDF-designated ‘yellow line’,” said Sarah Davies, an ICRC spokesperson.“The parties to the conflict determined the modalities of the operation and entrusted the ICRC to act as a neutral intermediary. The ICRC was not involved in those negotiations.”Davies added: “The ICRC was not involved in the search for the deceased nor does it take part in the physical recovery of remains.” A Red Cross official confirmed that the party it accompanied on the search was Hamas.View image in fullscreenMembers of the ICRC watch an excavator digging, reportedly in a search for bodies in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood east of Gaza City, on Monday.Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/ShutterstockUnder international humanitarian law, it is the responsibility of the parties involved in a conflict to search for, collect, and retrieve human remains.On Saturday, Donald Trump issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the militant group. “Hamas is going to have to start returning the bodies of the deceased hostages, including two Americans, quickly, or the other countries involved in this great peace will take action,” Trump wrote on his social media platform.As the 48-hour deadline neared, Hamas, accompanied by the ICRC, joined Egyptian teams authorised by Israel to search for remains beyond the line marking the Israeli military’s pullback insideGaza. An Israeli spokesperson said the Egyptian team would use excavator machines and trucks in the search.Footage published by Qatar’s Al Araby network appeared to show members of Hamas’s “Shadow Unit” – part of the group’s military wing tasked with guarding hostages – accompanying a Red Cross vehicle in al-Mawasi near Rafah, which lies outside Israeli military control. The news was later corroborated by Israeli and Palestinian media.Shosh Bedrosian, an Israeli government spokesperson, said representatives of Hamas, alongside the Red Cross and the Egyptian technical team, “have been permitted to enter beyond the yellow line position in Gaza under close [Israeli army] supervision to identify the location of our hostages”.Felesteen, the largest news outlet in circulation in Gaza before the war, described by Israel as a “Hamas daily”, said on Monday: “Members of the Qassam brigades accompanied teams from the International Committee of the Red Cross during field visits to areas beyond the yellow line in the Gaza Strip and the city of Rafah, to inspect sites believed to contain the bodies of Israeli soldiers and prisoners.”The search for the bodies of Israeli hostages has become one of the most sensitive issues in the ceasefire. The effort to locate the remains has proved difficult, given the presence of an estimated 60m tonnes of debris across the strip, where, according to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 10,000 Palestinians are recorded as missing, buried under the rubble.View image in fullscreenStaff from the ICRC have been working with an Egyptian team and machinery in the search.Photograph: Omar Ashtawy/APAImages/ShutterstockHamas has said it does not know the precise whereabouts of all the bodies, saying it has lost contact with several of its units that had been holding the captives and were reportedly killed during Israeli bombardments.However, on Sunday an Israeli government spokesperson said Hamas knew the whereabouts of the bodies. “If Hamas made more of an effort, they would be able to retrieve the remains of our hostages,” the spokesperson said.Although Trump has conceded that some of the bodies are difficult to reach, he said “others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not”. “It may have to do with the disarming of Hamas,” he added.Washington said it had received assurances from Hamas that the group would disarm, though no timeline has been set. The militant organisation remains reluctant to surrender its weapons without firm guarantees about the future of its fighters.Israel has made Hamas’s disarmament a central objective, describing it as a key condition for bringing an end to the two-year war.Yet on Sunday, Hamas’s chief negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the group’s weapons were “tied to the existence of occupation and aggression”. “If the occupation ends, these weapons will be handed over to the state,” he said. It remained unclear whether he was alluding to the still-unformed Palestinian governing authority expected to take over Gaza’s administration once Hamas relinquishes control.Another key element in cementing the truce will be the creation of a stabilisation force that will operate within the territory. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, whose diplomats took part in the ceasefire negotiations, had expressed his government’s willingness to take part in the force.However, on Monday the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said only countries that were “at least fair” to Israel could send troops to secure Gaza and ruled out Turkey’s participation. He said: “During the last four years and even before that, Erdoğan led a hostile approach against Israel. It is not reasonable for us to let their armed forces enter [the] Gaza Strip.”Explore more on these topicsHamasIsraelGazaPalestineMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I wouldn’t want to be 5,000 miles anywhere near the Netanyahu regime,” he toldthe Sunday Times magazine,referring to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.Radiohead announce first tour dates since 2018 – and face boycott from pro-Palestine campaignersRead moreThe interview with members of the British band – whose UK No 1 albums include OK Computer and Kid A – took place before this month’s ceasefire agreement betweenIsraeland Hamas.The band kick off their first tour in seven years next month, playing 20 shows in five European cities. Before the dates were officially confirmed, the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel had already shared a statement calling for a boycott of the tour, as a result of band member Jonny Greenwood’s performance in Tel Aviv in 2024.Radiohead’s 2016-2018 A Moon Shaped Pool world tour ignited a backlash when the group performed in Tel Aviv, despite boycott calls andpublic criticism from cultural figures including British director Ken Loach.In astatement on Xat that time, responding directly to Loach, Yorke said: “Playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing the government. We’ve played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others. As we have in America. We don’t endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America.”Yorke has previouslycriticised the pro-Palestine boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement, calling it “patronising in the extreme” and “offensive”.Yorke hinted at some regret over the decision to play in Tel Aviv in 2017 in the new interview, saying he was “horrified” when a “clearly connected high up” Israeli came to their hotel to thank them for playing.The band’s stance on Israel has dogged its members for years.Yorke briefly walked off stage during a solo gig in Australialast year after a pro-Palestinian heckler shouted “how many dead children will it take for you to condemn the genocide in Gaza”.He later released a statementsaying the incident in Melbourne left him “in shock that my supposed silence was somehow being taken as complicity”, and called Netanyahu and his administration “extremists” who “need to be stopped”.Yorke’s bandmate Greenwood is married to an Israeli artist and has faced sustained criticism from boycott advocates for his longtime collaboration with Israel-born rock musician Dudu Tassa. In 2024, Greenwood joined protests in Israel calling for the removal of Netanyahu.TheRadioheadguitarist told the Sunday Times magazine that he spent a lot of time in Israel with family and was “not ashamed of working with Arab and Jewish musicians”.– Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsRadioheadThom YorkeJonny GreenwoodIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

One Labour insider said the danger was “ending up with reform as a slogan rather than something people can actually touch”.His comments followed a day of unusually frank conversations among Labour MPs, many of whom privately praisedWes Streeting’s response to the byelection loss in Wales, after he told broadcasters Labour had not told a “compelling enough story” about its achievements. He compared Labour’s third place in Caerphilly to the 2021 Hartlepool byelection, which led Keir Starmer to contemplate resigning as party leader.He told the Sunday Times that Starmer “not only took that result on the chin, he took it to heart” and used it to accelerate his reform of the party in opposition.Labour’s vote share in Caerphillyfell to 11%, with Plaid Cymru surging to victory and Reform UK taking second place, splitting between an anti-establishment local sentiment and populist anger.Several MPs described the health secretary’s tone as “blunt but refreshing”, highlighting an appetite for plainer, more evocative language that cuts through the party’s cautious talk of change.Others still argue that Starmer’s sharp conference pivot, especially his moral attack on Reform UK’s “politics of division” and “racist policies”, could still prove decisive. They believe it came from a progressive place and could reset the conversation before May’s local elections.“It’s the right fight,” one MP said. “The question is whether he’s left himself enough time to win it. We need to double down, not shy away.”Explore more on these topicsLabourDavid LammyWes StreetingnewsShareReuse this content"

The state of California was not immediately available for comment.Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, told the New York Times it was “truly shocking that one of the biggest polluters on the planet would be opposed to transparency”, adding that the laws “have already been upheld in court and we continue to have confidence in them.”Exxon is asking the court to block the enforcement of the laws, which is set to begin in 2026. The company already reports emissions and climate risks voluntarily, using different methodologies, it said in the lawsuit.But the laws would force the company to adopt the state’s preferred frameworks for emissions and risk reporting, which it finds “misleading and counterproductive”, the lawsuit says.To calculate its emissions, Exxon uses a method established by the global non-profit oil and gas industry association Ipieca, which wascreated in 1974to allow a UN environmental group to interface with polluting industries. But under one of the two California laws, it would have to use a methodology known as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, developed by the research group World Resources Institute and business network World Business Council for Sustainable Development.That framework sends “the counterproductive message that large companies are uniquely responsible for climate change no matter how efficiently they satisfy societal demand for energy, goods, and services”, the lawsuit says.The California law also requires companies to report their global emissions footprint. But Exxon argues that the rule should apply only to emissions created by company activity within California’s borders, since the a vast majority of Exxon’s business operations occur outside the state.The second 2023 California law that Exxon is challenging requires companies to disclose the threat that climate change poses to their business operations, and how they plan to address them. That would require it to speculate “about unknowable future developments”, Exxon argued.It also claimed that the law conflicts with existing federal securities laws, which already regulate what publicly traded companies must disclose regarding financial and environmental risks.Taken together, the two laws constitute overreach by California officials, the lawsuit argues. The laws aimed to “to shape public opinion and shame private parties disfavored by the State,” Exxon said.Supporters of the California rules say they discourage greenwashing from companies.“The disclosure requirements would really pull back the curtain on the biggest climate destroyers in the oil industry,” Hollin Kretzmann, a senior attorney at the environmental advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity,told the Guardianafter they were passed.Last year, business interests including the US Chamber of Commerce, California Chamber of Commerce, and American Farm Bureau Federation sued California over the same two laws. A judgedenieda motion from the business groups to block the laws, but the case is still proceeding with a trial date expected in October 2026.The US Securities and Exchange Commission had also been working to implement new federal climate disclosure rules, and was nearing completion toward the end of Joe Biden’s term in the White House. Those rules also faced legal challenges; in March, the agency voted to end its legal defense of the rules.Explore more on these topicsExxonMobilCaliforniaOil and gas companiesOilWest CoastClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Scientists this monthwarned that a tipping point had been reachedwhereby corals around the world are set to be wiped out due to global heating, which is raising heat to intolerable levels in our oceans.“We’re running out of time,” said Ross Cunning, lead author of the new Florida study and a research biologist at Shedd Aquarium. “Extreme heatwaves are increasing in frequency and severity due to climate change, and without immediate, ambitious actions to slow ocean warming and boost coral resilience, we risk the extinction of even more corals from reefs in Florida and around the world.”Planet’s first catastrophic climate tipping point reached, report says, with coral reefs facing ‘widespread dieback’Read moreThe new research,published in the Science journal, analyzed the fate of staghorn (Acropora cervicornis) and elkhorn (Acropora palmata) corals off the Florida coast following a severe marine heatwave in 2023, which raised temperatures on Florida’s fraying coral reefs to their highest levels in over 150 years.The two species are complex, reef-building corals and are named because they resemble, respectively, the antlers of stags and elks. However, researchers who conducted diver surveys of more than 52,000 colonies of the species, across 391 sites along Florida’s coast, found widespread, often devastating, losses.Along the Florida Keys, mortality rates reached 98% and even 100%, revealing a complete annihilation of the corals. In south-east Florida, where temperatures have been cooler, mortality rates were lower, at about 38%.The twoAcroporaspecies had alreadysufferedfrom decades of localized impacts in Florida, such as poor water quality coming from pollutants that wash off the land, as well as disease. But the 2023 heatwave has proved fatal for these heat-sensitive species.The 2023 event caused the ninth episode of bleaching on the Florida reef – aprocesswhereby corals become heat-stressed andexpel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to become ghostly white. If temperatures remain elevated, the corals die off completely.Globally, coral reefs are among the ecosystems most vulnerable to the human-caused climate crisis. This poses a major threat to a quarter of all ocean life that relies upon what are essentially the rainforests of the sea, as well as hundreds of millions of people who depend upon corals to support fish that they can consume and gain an income from.Corals also act as a barrier to protect our shorelines from powerful storms, which are themselves being worsened by rising global temperatures.In a desperate attempt to prevent a death spiral of threatened corals, scientists have established repositories ofAcroporain aquariums and offshore coral nurseries. Attempts havebeen made to reseed corals on reefs in Florida, too, in an effort to regain some of the 90% of coral cover lost off the state in the past four decades.But as global heating continues to escalate, there is little hope of long-term survival of these species without major interventions, researchers warn.“Elkhorn corals, in particular, are some of the most important wave-breaking coral species in the region,” said Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami and another study co-author.“They used to be common on shallow reef crests in the Caribbean, and if we want our reefs to continue protecting our coastlines from flooding during storms, its worth taking extraordinary measures to ensure we don’t lose these corals altogether.”Explore more on these topicsCoralMarine lifeOceansFloridaClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

But Braun has said, if the state doesn’t redraw its maps, “probably, we’ll have consequences of not working with theTrump administrationas tightly as we should.”John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, highlighted the opposition in a statement on Monday.“Between the overwhelming opposition from Hoosiers and the relentless pressure from Washington – including but not limited to Vice-President [JD] Vance taking two taxpayer-funded trips to the state, threats to cut federal funding, and phone calls from President Trump – Governor Braun clearly called this special session solely because he got orders from Washington,” he said. “Hoosiers do not want a mid-decade gerrymander.”Also on Monday, the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, isreportedlyheaded to Illinois to meet with local leaders about redrawing the congressional maps. Jeffries will meet with the Illinois legislative Black caucus and Black members of Congress, a nod to the fact that Black lawmakers will be needed to pass a new map, according to Punchbowl News.Last week, the Illinois senate Black caucus warned that it wouldn’t support a new map if it dilutes the Black voting population, Punchbowl noted. There are three historically Black districts among Illinois’s 17 congressional seats. Only three of the state’s seats are held by Republicans.Explore more on these topicsIndianaUS politicsTrump administrationUS CongressHouse of RepresentativesnewsShareReuse this content"

No half measures, and no gamesmanship.” NBC Newsfirst reportedthe letter.Americans brace for food stamps to run out: ‘The greatest hunger catastrophe since the Great Depression’Read moreA “clean” continuing resolution is a temporary spending bill that keeps the government running at current funding levels without attaching other political demands. Republicans say they have offered that in their measure, but Democrats argue the bill shortchanges key services and are using their power in the Senate to push for a deal onhealth insurance subsidiesthat expire at year’s end.Because of this stalemate, hundreds of thousands of federal andWashington DCgovernment employees are either working without pay or furloughed. The union represents workers across nearly every federal agency, from Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers and army nurses to food safety inspectors and veterans affairs staff, many of whom are now lined up at food banks after missing their second paycheck, Kelley said.“These are patriotic Americans – parents, caregivers, and veterans – forced to work without pay while struggling to cover rent, groceries, gas and medicine because of political disagreements in Washington,” Kelley said. “That is unacceptable.”But the crisis extends beyond federal workers: roughly 42 million Americans who receive food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programface losing their benefitsas soon as 1 November if the shutdown continues, after the US agriculture department warned states it would run out of money to pay for the program.Senate Democrats have blocked a Republican-backed continuing resolution 12 times, demanding commitments on extending Affordable Care Act health subsidies. Three Democrats and one independent who caucus with the party have broken ranks to support the measure, but it remains short of the 60 needed to advance.

The cuts come months after the retail giant’s CEOwarned white-collar employeestheir jobs could be taken by artificial intelligence.The Seattle-based technology firm is planning to cut as many as 30,000 corporate jobs beginning Tuesday, media outlets includingReutersandthe Wall Street Journalreported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, as it tries to cut costs and undo the vast recruitment drive it embarked on at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which unleashed an extraordinary – but fleeting – surge in demand for online shopping.While the layoffs would represent a small portions of Amazon’s sprawling global workforce of 1.55 million employees, they would hit about 10% of its roughly 350,000 corporate employees.CNBCcalled it the largest layoff in the company’s history.Amazon declined to comment. Shares in the firm, which is scheduled to report quarterly earnings later this week, rose 1.2% on Monday.Other giants of the internet have likewise backtracked on the major hiring undertaken during the coronavirus pandemic. Microsoft; Meta, parent of Whatsapp, Instagram and Facebook; and Alphabet, parent of Google and YouTube, have all laid off tens of thousands of workers in the past three years.Back in June, the group’s CEO, Andy Jassy, told employees that AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – and generative AI systems such as chatbots would require fewer employees in some areas.“It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” Jassy wrote in a memo to staff.In recent years, Amazon has been trimming smaller numbers of jobs across multiple divisions, including devices, communications, podcasting and others.This week’s wave of cuts is expected to affect a wide variety of divisions within Amazon, including human resources, known as people experience and technology, devices and services and operations, among others. Fortunereportedthat as many as 15% of the firm’s HR roles could be hit, citing multiple sources familiar with Amazon’s plans.Managers of affected teams were asked to undergo training on Monday for how to communicate with staff following notifications that will start going out via email tomorrow morning, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources.Jassy has been undertaking an initiative to reduce what he has described as an excess of bureaucracy at the company, including by reducing the number of managers, and introduced an anonymous complaint line for claims of inefficiencies that has elicited about 1,500 responses and more than 450 process changes, he said earlier this year.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsAmazonnewsShareReuse this content"

Their respective teams will start “immediately” to discuss tariffs and other matters, he said.An agreement between the US and China reduces the chances of an all out global trade war that threatened car production across Europe and the UK.It comes after months of escalated trade tensions between the two economic super-powers, triggered by Trump’s “liberation day” tariff announcement outside the White House in April.With just days to go before their current tariff truce was due to end, Xi showed he had no intention of submitting to Trump’s threats of 100% tariffs.Instead he turned the screws on the US,imposing controls on exports of rare earth mineralsincluding magnets a critical element used for electronic window and boot openings in cars.Trump accused Beijing, which controls 60% of global production and 90% of the refineries of rare earths, of “becoming very hostile” and trying to hold the world “captive”.Beijing also hit the US agriculture sector hard, stopping buying soya beans from the US. China is the US’s biggest soya bean customer, importing half of all $24bn (£18bn) in exports in 2024.“I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday,” Bessent told reporters after he and US trade representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese vice-premier He Lifeng and Li for their fifth round of in-person discussions since May.Bessent said he anticipates that a tariff truce with China will be extended beyond its 1 November expiry date, and that China will revive substantial purchases of US soya beans after buying none in September and instead sourcing the crop from Brazil and Argentina.US soya bean farmers “will feel very good about what’s going on both for this season and the coming seasons for several years” once the deal’s terms are announced, Bessent told ABC.Greer said both sides agreed to pause some punitive actions and found “a path forward where we can have more access to rare earths from China, we can try to balance out our trade deficit with sales from the United States.”Tensions between Brazil and the United States have also escalated since August when Trump increased tariffs on imports of most Brazilian goods to 50% from 10% in August.“We agreed that our teams will meet immediately to advance the search for solutions to the tariffs and sanctions against Brazilian authorities,” Lula said in a social media post after the meeting.Trump had linked the tariff move to what he called a “witch-hunt” against Jair Bolsonaro, the South American country’s former president.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpChinaXi JinpingTariffsAsia PacificInternational tradeTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

According to IMF data, Athens has tackled a budget overspend that raced to 210% as a proportion of GDP in 2020.Amid tax cuts for high earners, the US is expected to run annual budget deficits of more than 7% over the next five years, while Italy is due to cut its spending shortfall this year to 2.9%, allowing it to meet a 3% limit set by Brussels a year early, in analysis first reported in theFinancial Times.Trump increased US government spending and cut federal taxes in the “big, beautiful bill”, passed by Congress in the summer, forcing the White House to rely more heavily on borrowing to fund annual spending.The US president reversed efforts under the previous Biden administration to limit the size of the US deficit, offering tax cuts that will benefit mostly middle and high income groups. He has also pledged to build a “golden dome” defence shield, which could cost almost $1tn.Spending increases could push the budget deficit higher by $7tn a year by the time Trump is due to leave office in January 2029.Both Italy and Greece have committed to maintaining primary budget surpluses, which entail cuts in spending to below the incomes from tax receipts.Italy’s growth rate is expected to average 0.5% over the next couple of years. Its population is falling due to a declining birthrate and a level of emigration that hit 200,000 last year, but Italy has seen average household incomes recover.Lorenzo Codogno, the head of Lorenzo Codogno Macro Advisors and a former chief economist at Italy’s treasury department, said there was pressure on Giorgia Meloni’s government to increase spending in the wake of Trump’s tariffs and his demands for bigger European defence budgets.He said: “The economy and public finances remain vulnerable to a sudden negative shift in the global scenario.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For a while, it seemed like they would get it.Ghislaine Maxwell,Epstein’s ex-girlfriend, wasfound guiltyof sex trafficking four years ago for her involvement in the late financier’s sexual abuse of teen girls – andsentencedto 20 years’ imprisonment.Meanwhile, banks who had done business with Epstein, although not admitting wrongdoing, paidhundreds of millionsin settlements to victims. Donald Trump even made releasing the Epstein investigative files part of his campaign platform, and doubled down on his promise to do so early this year.In the end, Trump’s justice department did not release these files, and his administration has become embroiled in reports about social ties between him and Epstein. Congressional promises to release files have lagged, due to political jockeying and justice department foot-dragging.But two new lawsuits could shed light on Epstein’s activities amid the stalemate – regardless of their outcome.These lawsuits, filed by an anonymous plaintiff against Bank of America and the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), allege that these financial powerhouses illicitly enabled Epstein’s sex trafficking. The suits are helmed by Sigrid S McCawley, of Boies Schiller Flexner, and Brad Edwards of Edwards Henderson, who have long represented Epstein victims.“Epstein committed these crimes by means of not only his own extraordinary wealth and power, but through access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including BNY,” one lawsuit claims. “Egregiously, BNY had a plethora of information regarding Epstein’s sex trafficking operation but chose profit over protecting the victims.”The Bank of America suit echoes these allegations, claiming the institution “knowingly provided the financial support and the veneer of institutional legitimacy for Epstein and his co-conspirators to fuel their international sex trafficking organization under the guise of non-criminal business activities”. The suit also said Bank of America neglected to file suspicious activity reports.Longtime attorneys who spoke to the Guardian said proving such a case would be difficult. But they also identified possible outcomes which could provide solace to accusers or disclosure of long-sought information.Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who founded West Coast Trial Lawyers, said evidence has to show that an institution’s actions led to harm.“I don’t think the lawsuit has much of a chance of success – and obviously I am on the side of the victims, and I want them to get answers and criminal justice and compensation,” Rahmani said. Some claims might be too tangential from a legal standpoint.“It all comes down to evidence,” Rahmani said. A lawyer would need to prove causation, which would mean “but for the defendant’s conduct, the injury wouldn’t have occurred”. In this instance, that would boil down to “but for the bank’s conduct, the victim maybe wouldn’t have been trafficked”, Rahmani explained.An attorney would also have to go beyond a “but for” measure. “It’s not just ‘but for’ causation. It also has to be a substantial factor: that is the legal test. So whatever misconduct there was, if there was any misconduct … the defendant’s misconduct has to have been a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff harm.“By engaging in a business relationship with Epstein, is that a substantial factor? I don’t know.”Liability aside, suits like this could put institutions on notice that relationships with those accused of wrongdoing can have damaging implications for them.“It’s a PR nightmare,” he said. If the banks try to get these suits dismissed and fail, Rahmani expects a swift settlement. “No one wants to go litigate any of the Epstein-related cases.”Eric Faddis, a trial attorney, former prosecutor and founder of the Colorado law firm Varner Faddis, said companies can be liable. In this situation, “whether the banks have liability is going to hinge, in part, on what the banks knew, whether they had any knowledge of alleged abuse or criminal wrongdoing”, and somehow provided assistance to Epstein.“But even then, I think it’s going to be difficult to sort of loop the banks into some kind of sex-trafficking scheme. The banks would probably not be privy to the details of allegations,” Faddis said. While Epstein’s Florida conviction was public, “it’s not illegal for a bank to have a client who’s an unsavory person”.“It is illegal for a bank to somehow be complicit in the criminal activity of a client, but those two issues are very different, and so I think that it’s going to be a tough lawsuit against the banks.”That said, important aspects of the litigation could help Epstein survivors.“The lawsuits have the potential to reveal more information about the ongoing Epstein saga,” Faddis said. “Even though there have been sort of walls put up at every turn for folks seeking this information, when there’s a lawsuit, there’s a discovery process, and that discovery process often requires disclosure of information that was not previously public.”Edwards said in a statement that the suits could have a deterrent effect and accomplish what lawmakers had failed to do.“The lawsuits are necessary for complete justice for the victims ofJeffrey Epstein– as well as for future would-be victims who will suffer from similar trafficking organizations – if our financial institutions are not held accountable for the essential role each plays, either in providing the necessary infrastructure for the illegal operation or recognizing the financial component of these crimes and putting an end to it.He added: “We have a far better chance of making a real difference than Congress, because we know the facts and history of the case and are not motivated by politics but rather by a genuine desire to make a real difference and to protect the survivors, who have already suffered tremendously.“We approach these matters without any political agenda and thus cannot be deterred by shutdowns, protecting wealthy politically connected individuals, or the other embarrassing partisan gamesmanship you and the rest of the world have had to watch unfold recently.”McCawley said in a statement: “As Congress works toward unraveling how Jeffrey Epstein was able to orchestrate his criminal sex-trafficking enterprise for decades without detection, we are taking another important step forward toward justice for survivors.”Asked or comment on the lawsuit, BNY said in a statement: “The claims in the lawsuit are meritless, and we will vigorously defend against it.”Bank of America’s statement similarly remarked: “We will vigorously defend ourselves in this matter.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Hayes maintained his innocence and claimed during his original trial that he was taking part in an “industry-wide” practice, accusing regulators ofmaking him a scapegoat.Hayes is now seeking recompense for the suffering he says he faced as a result of his original ruling.He is suingUBSfor “malicious prosecution”, and says UBS conducted a “fundamentally flawed” investigation in order to pin the blame on Hayes.Efforts to sue UBS come months after the UK supreme courtoverturned a decade-old rulingagainst Hayes in July. That decision was based on faults in the original trial, with the original judge determined to have given “inaccurate and unfair” instructions to the jury that found Hayes guilty on charges of conspiracy to defraud. This meant the former banker was ultimately deprived of a fair trial.However, the supreme court judges stopped short of fully exonerating Hayes, saying there was “ample evidence” that could have led a jury, if properly directed, to find him guilty. “But the jury was not properly directed,” the ruling explained, adding: “The convictions are therefore unsafe and cannot stand.”Commenting on the lawsuit against UBS, Hayes said: “It has taken me over a decade to overturn my wrongful conviction and clear my name. My legal team are now rightlyfully holding UBS to account for scapegoating me in order to save billions in fines and protect its senior executives.“My life was ruined by the bank’s actions – I lost my liberty and my marriage, missed out on my son’s childhood, and my physical and mental health suffered terribly. UBS also destroyed my reputation and career.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The news was also sharedduring a morning meeting of CBS Evening News staff.CBS News staffers react to Bari Weiss being named editor-in-chief: ‘It’s utterly depressing’Read more“I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me – the work, the audience’s attention and the honor of being a part of the network’s history – and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who’ve made me a better journalist and a better human,” wrote Dickerson, who has been serving as co-anchor of CBS Evening News.Bari Weiss, thenew CBS News editor-in-chief, is expected to revamp the evening news and has been working to find a new anchor. She is interested in Bret Baier, an anchor on the rightwing Fox News,Status reported, although Baier is under contract at Fox for several more years.Dickerson’s planned departure from the network comes after Shari Redstone, the previous owner of CBS’s parent company, Paramount, agreed to a settle a lawsuit with the Trump administration over a 60 Minutes interview with then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. While legal experts said the lawsuit had little merit, Redstone needed approval from federal regulators to sell the company to an entertainment company backed by the billionaire Larry Ellison.Some observers and CBS employees saw the move as Redstone in effect bribing Trump and sacrificing journalistic integrity to serve her business interests.Away from the news division, the network alsoabruptly announcedthe cancelation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert shortly before Paramount’stakeover by Skydance Mediawas finalized, prompting widespread criticism.Regulators ultimately approved the deal, and the company’s new CEO, David Ellison, has also faced criticism for hiring a Trump ally as the network’s ombudsman and appointing Weiss, who does not have any broadcast journalism experience and has frequently attacked news organizations like the New York Times, as the editor-in-chief.A longtime 60 Minutes executive producerleft the network in Aprilbecause he said he had lost his journalistic independence. The president and chief executive officer of CBS News resigned in May because she said it had “become clear the company and I do not agree on the path forward”.Ex-60 Minutes producer Bill Owens says bosses discouraged him from covering Gaza and TrumpRead moreWhile Dickerson did not mention concerns about the future of the station in his departure announcement, he was among those who criticized the settlement.“We pride ourselves on our BS detector, so it ought to work on ourselves, too,” Dickerson said on CBS Evening News Plus in July.“When it doesn’t, the stakes are real, a loss of public trust, the spread of misinformation,” he continued. “The Paramount settlement poses a new obstacle. Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?”Tom Cibrowski, president of CBS News, said that Dickerson “epitomizes the very best of journalism”.One CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said they were saddened, but not surprised, by Dickerson’s departure. “He’s an excellent journalist, good human being, and someone you want in a newsroom,” the staffer said.His exit probably spells the end of the two-anchor format on CBS Evening News, which the network debuted in late January, but has not improved the show’s fortunes. It was unclear whether Dickerson’s co-anchor, Maurice DuBois, would remain with the program.Explore more on these topicsCBSUS television industryTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

However, he said that readers ultimately look for books written by famous authors.“We are programmed deep in our DNA to be comforted by the authority and the reliability of big brand names, and that applies more than ever to the names of big writers,” he said.“There will be some shoddy content out there so people will turn increasingly to sources of authority for reassurance,” he said.Bloomsbury sales have been increased by a roster of high-profile authors in recent years, including the fantasy author Sarah J Maas, whose popularity has risen on TikTok.Maas, the author behind the “romantasy” series A Court of Thorns and Roses, has sold more than 70m copies of her books in English across the world. All of the titles have been published by Bloomsbury.Last week the publisher, which is headquartered in London and employs about 1,000 people, experienced a share rise of as much as 10% in a single day after it reported a 20% jump in revenue in its academic and professional division in the first half of its financial year, largely thanks to an AI licensing agreement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But given that they have spent almost 800 days top of the table since last being champions in 2004, nothing will be taken for granted at this stage. After an outlay of more than £250m in the summer, Mikel Arteta has a formidable squad that has been able to cope with injuries to important players such as Kai Havertz and Martin Ødegaard – a problem that derailed them in three successive runner-up finishes.There is also a new steely determination epitomised by their meagre defence, which has conceded three goals in 13 games in all competitions and only one from open play. A group that has learned and grown from its experiences is highly motivated to go one better, starting with their manager. The question is whether Liverpool orManchester Citycan recover to sustain a challenge that could make Arsenal nervous, especially if Viktor Gyökeres continues to struggle for goals. They have managed only five from open play and are heavily reliant on set pieces, although stopping Gabriel Magalhães and co is easier said than done.Ed AaronsThe team’s spine is strongIt’s probably too soon to anoint Arsenal as champions but their form makes ominous reading for the rest of the crowd, especially their defensive record. Gyökeres, Eberechi Eze and Martín Zubimendi have strengthened Mikel Arteta’s side but solid foundations are the significant pieces of the puzzle. For a while now William Saliba and Gabriel have ensured the soft centre is no more. Arteta’s old boss, Pep Guardiola, is surely his biggest rival for the title from here, with City capable of going on a similar run. Erling Haaland’s prolific form – he is the Premier League’s leading scorer with 11 and has outscored eight teams – means City simply cannot be discounted. Afterdefeat at Aston Villaon Sunday, Guardiola insisted he was far from reaching for the panic button when asked about the gap to the summit, clearly enthused by elements of his side’s display. On another day City could have won and only three points would separate the sides.Ben FisherSquad depth will be testedOf course the race is not over. Aside from the obvious – the clocks have just gone back and all the teams have 87 points left to play for – reservations over Arsenal’s ability to go the distance are well founded. In their favour, the league leaders are more experienced and resolute this season with greater strength in depth than their rivals. But Arteta’s side have a reputation as nearly men for a reason, their injury record is poor and whether they can handle the pressure of leading from the front is unknown. There is also a sense that Arsenal have edged clear thanks to the inconsistency of the competition rather than outstanding form.Inconsistency leads us on to City and Liverpool, teams in transition (necessary or otherwise) and stuttering as a consequence, but whose talent is unquestionable. Guardiola’s and Arne Slot’s ability to deliver aPremier Leaguetitle is proven. City are re-emerging but are only a Haaland injury away from trouble. Liverpool’s title defence is worse than their last one after nine games (20 points in 2020-21 compared with 15 now) but, daft as it sounds, they are capable of turning things around providing Slot discovers his best XI and big‑money signings finally make an impact. But maybe Bournemouth under the brilliant Andoni Iraola will continue to disrupt the usual suspects?Andy HunterBelief will be vitalArsenal’s defence is the Ebenezer Scrooge of the Premier League and the telling bellwether of why Arteta’s team may well be crowned champions. Liverpool’sfourth consecutive league defeaton Saturday, at Brentford, leaves them seven points behind the Gunners and in a freefall a seemingly flailing Slot is struggling to arrest. Of the other traditional contenders City also lost at the weekend as Guardiola continues to rue the anterior cruciate ligament injury Rodri sustained last September. Rodri was missing at Villa with a hurt hamstring, the latest problem hampering his attempt to regain consistent fitness, and it was notable that Guardiola eschewed the supposed deputy, Nico González, for Tijjani Reijnders in the XI, then replaced the latter for the former on 66 minutes: a sure sign the manager remains unsure who best fills the Rodri role when the Spanish midfielder is absent.Chelsea, the last team before City or Liverpool to win the league (in 2016-17), also went down – last gaspat home against Sunderland– and their eight-point deficit to Arsenal can be cast as a chasm. Of the rest, Manchester United, Sunderland, Tottenham and Bournemouth are unlikely candidates for obvious reasons. With Areta’s side also being the division’s joint second highest scorers with 16, their only glass half empty scenario is the question of mental courage. In the three second-place finishes of the past three seasons can be found a question of hard nosed belief. The glaring example came in 2022-23 when, on 1 April, they held an eight-point advantage over City (who had a game in hand) before capitulating, taking only three points from the next available 12 and ending five points behind Guardiola’s champions. Also, we are only nine matches in.Jamie JacksonQuick GuideArsenal's next nine league fixturesShow1 NovBurnley(a)8 NovSunderland(a)23 NovTottenham(h)30 NovChelsea(a)3 DecBrentford(h)6 DecAston Villa(a)13 DecWolves(h)21 DecEverton(a)27 DecBrighton(h)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Difficult period still to comeIs the title race done? Not quite yet. The margin for error for the chasing pack is almost gone but Arsenal have some awkward games before Christmas. Come through those unscathed and they will appear unstoppable. A slip or two will give others hope. But Arsenal look so strong. A defence to rival Chelsea’s 2004-05 vintage ensures calm. Arsenal have faced one shot on target in their past three games: absurd. Equally, they are 17th for goals from open play. Ugly wins could easily turn into frustrating draws.Others lack that durability. Chelsea are too up and down. Tottenham are poor at home and lack individual quality. Liverpool are in a top-four fight now. City have Haaland but are in transition. It’s not being patronising to say that Bournemouth simply have a great chance of Champions League qualification. It leaves us in the strange position of wondering whetherManchester Unitedare quietly dangerous. Their underlying numbers are good and they should benefit from no European football. United, though? Are we really relying on United? It’s basically there for Arsenal. They may get nervous but only if there is pressure on their lead. Still, let’s see where they are after they go to Villa Park on 6 December.Jacob SteinbergThe season has barely begunThe clocks have just gone back, we’re not quite out of October and there are still an awful lot of hard yards to be covered. Arsenal have started impressively but they don’t look invincible. Tottenham, City and Liverpool are only five, six and seven points back respectively. At this stage of a campaign those sorts of gaps can easily be closed. And let’s not forgetBournemouth. Only four points off the top, lacking European distractions and in possession of an outstanding manager, they have surely earned the right to dream.Arteta will know better than to indulge in any title fantasies as he approaches a potentially season defining November fixture list featuring league trips to Burnley,Sunderland– who have only five fewer points – and Chelsea plus a home derby with Tottenham. Given that, in between, there are Champions League dates with Slavia Prague and Bayern Munich, the road ahead looks hazardous. Moreover, every team ebb and flow to some extent over 38 league games. Some specifically tailor pre-season training to try to ensure strong run-ins and accept slightly slow starts as an inevitable side effect. At some point Alexander Isak will surely start scoring again; Liverpool’s title defence is not quite over. Do not write City off either.Louise TaylorRivals lack consistencyNo title race is ever done before the quarter-way point, but Arsenal are in an extremely strong position. Finishing second three times in succession has, perhaps unfairly, created a now-or-never dynamic, and for now they seem to be responding to that with efficiency and ruthlessness. Their defensive solidity means that, even if they don’t play well, they only have to score once to win and their exceptional ability from dead balls makes that more likely than not. Vitally, they can win games in two different ways. Their squad looks the most coherent in the division, with multiple players in most positions; they’ve opened up a four-point gap despite being without Ødegaard, Havertz and Noni Madueke.But it’s not just that Arsenal look very good; it’s that it’s very hard to see who could put together a consistent enough run to overhaul them.Liverpool, as Slot keeps admitting, have been worked out; City are also trying to accommodate a number of new players and seem overreliant on Haaland; and Chelsea are blunt without Cole Palmer and look short at the back. Under pressure, there’s a chance any leader can crumble; but nobody looks capable of applying that pressure.Jonathan WilsonExplore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalManchester CityLiverpoolManchester UnitedTottenham HotspurChelseaanalysisShareReuse this content"

But it was Jordan Love who was able to control the gameOliver ConnollyMon 27 Oct 2025 07.34 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 14.09 EDTShareIt all started so well. And then it fell apart.For two quarters, it looked like Aaron Rodgers might conjure one of those nights, the sort that ends with a smirk, a wink, and a reminder that he can match any of the league’s young pups. It was the first time in his career that he played against Green Bay, where he spent nearly two decades, won four MVPsand a lone Super Bowl. But the NFL rarely cares for nostalgia.The Packers’ 35–25 win over the Steelers became something more revealing: a portrait of where both teams – and both quarterbacks – stand.The Steelers took a 16-7 lead into the half. The game was played at their speed. They ran the ball effectively, Rodgers spread it around efficiently and kicker Chris Boswell nailed three 50-plus efforts to take the lead.But things flipped in the third quarter. The Packers have a young, athletic defense with All-Pro-caliber players at every level. And for two quarters, they made Rodgers look old. Up front, Micah Parsons ripped through double and triple teams. In the middle, Edgerrin Cooper and Quay Walker patrolled with speed and range, thumping everything in sight. On the back end, the Packers’ secondary – with an average age of 26 – flew to the ball, anchored by deep safety Xavier McKinney.It was a sharp contrast to Rodgers’ Steelers, who are built in a different image: heavy, methodical, defined by structure rather than creative freedom. Their offense runs through jumbo personnel packages, leaning on the ground game and trusting Rodgers to convert on third downs. It works when everything is tidy. But when the rhythm is disrupted or they fall behind the sticks, this version of Rodgers can no longer bend a game to his will.Everybody hates Russ: how the NFL’s nicest guy became its most resented | Andrew LawrenceRead moreHe’s 41 now, and the signs are visible. The brain still sees the openings, but the legs can’t quite keep up. His age has hamstrung his creativity; the moments where he used to escape, reset, and improvise have waned. Rodgers remains one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the league. He is money in the quick game, getting the ball out in a flash to anyone and everyone. He finished the night 24 of 36 for 219 yards and two touchdowns. That efficiency is a poor substitute for the magic of old.There are still glimpses here and there, like his early bomb down the sideline to Roman Wilson. It was a throwback to the old Rodgers, bouncing around the pocket, extending a play and whipping a deep shot beyond the coverage. A few plays later, he hit DK Metcalf on a slant for a touchdown, the kind of timing throw that only looks simple because he’s made it so for 18 years.Roman Wilson takes the top off the defense!GBvsPIT on NBCStream on@NFLPlus+ Peacockpic.twitter.com/5z0GrNBxUa— NFL (@NFL)October 27, 2025That version of Rodgers remains dangerous. He can win games. But after the half, the Packers’ defense cranked up to a different level. They dared Rodgers to hold the ball, escape the pocket and make plays on the move. He couldn’t keep up.Rodgers spent the second half with his eyes on Parsons, even when there were options down the field or Parsons wasn’t in his area code. The Green Bay-era Rodgers would have moved and found open targets. He’d have pointed and laughed at Parsons. But on Sunday, he couldn’t avoid the near-constant pressure and was harassed on more than 50% of his dropbacks and dropped three times.This is how it goes with ageing players: the mind is still willing, but the body isn’t always able. Rodgershascreated more out of structure over the past three weeks than at any time in the past two seasons, but against one of the league’s better fronts, escaping without being rocked was his only victory.Instead, he was forced to watch Jordan Love do his best impression of peak-Rodgers on the other side of the field. Love was sharp and decisive, completing 29 of 37 passes for 360 yards and three touchdowns, spreading the ball to 10 different receivers. At one point, he had completed 20 passes in a row, taking the easy stuff underneath, ripping heaters down the field and showing off his playmaking chops.Jordan Love is a freakpic.twitter.com/jBpFcfwfZB— Eli Berkovits (@BookOfEli_NFL)October 27, 2025“He played great, played fantastic,” Rodgers said of Love post-game. “He’s had a really nice season. He’s been really efficient with the football. He’s opportunistic, though. I felt like he was very patient tonight. They took the run solutions. He took the checkdowns, moved in the pocket well. He played outstanding.”For the Packers, this is what progress looks like. They have the look of a team gelling at the right moment, one that can control the game on either side of the ball. For the Steelers, it was another reminder that experience alone doesn’t guarantee anything. Their plan – to grind, to lean on veterans and trust their defense – can only go so far. They have the league’s most expensive defense, but their big-name secondary was carved open by Love all night. Their roster sits in the league’s familiar middle ground: capable of beating anyone, vulnerable to everyone.Still, even in defeat, this was Rodgers’ night. We have lived with many variations of Rodgers over his 21-year career. Young Rodgers. Post-Favre Rodgers. Arrogant Rodgers. MVP Rodgers. Defiant Rodgers. Kooky Rodgers. Sad-Jets Rodgers. The is-he-finished Rodgers. But Sunday was a fresh take. Rodgers was almost wistful. He didn’t snarl at a former team, as he did inWeek One after beating the Jets. Asked about the “Go Pack Go” chants that filled the Steelers’ stadium as the game slipped away, he smiled. “I heard that chant for 18 years,” he said. “Packers fans travel really well. First time in a while I’ve used silent count for a home game. That’s a credit to those Packers fans.”Thisseemedlike a Rodgers at peace. He recognizes where he’s at. The arm is still there. His brain still works at double speed. But football’s clock keeps ticking – and he can no longer match the league’s best throw-for-throw. In seeking to join the rare club of quarterbacks who have beaten all 32 teams, he fell short. And he watched from the sideline as he experienced something he inflicted on the league for 18 years: a Green Bay quarterback shredding a defense with a combination of precision and wow throws. The passing of the torch was almost too on the nose.MVP of the weekView image in fullscreenTua Tagovailoa talks with his opposite number, Kirk Cousins, after Sunday’s game.Photograph: Mike Stewart/APTua Tagovailoa, QB, Miami Dolphins.For a week, Tagovailoa was a punchline. After the worst performance of his career, he looked adrift, unsure of himself, his team and how long he would remain in Miami. Then Sunday happened. The Dolphins rolled into Atlanta and right over the Falcons, 34-10, behind a throwback performance from their quarterback.Tagovailoa completed 20 of 26 passes for 206 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 138.6. He was efficient when in rhythm and showed off his playmaking chops out of structure, throwing a dart on the run to Malik Washington to give the Dolphins an early lead.Seven days earlier, the headlines were about excuses and errant throws. Tagovailoa had tried to explain away his struggles by half-heartedlylobbing teammates under the bus, then doubled down with a scattershot display against Cleveland that ended with him on the bench. That was the version with two working eyes. This week, Tagovailoa played through an infection that left his left eye swollen. “Probably one of the worst experiences I’ve had in terms of waking up,” Tagovailoa said post-game. “I’m just glad I was able to go out there and play.”Somehow, one-eyed Tagovailoa saw everything clearly. Back in his role as facilitator, he helped snap Miami’s three-game skid and, for now, silenced the noise about his job security.Stat of the weekView image in fullscreenMyles Garrett has been brilliant but even he can’t save the Browns.Photograph: Sue Ogrocki/APFive. That’s the number of sacks Myles Garrett put up against the Patriots. The best pass-rusher in the league put on a show in New England, despite the Browns being leveled 32-13. Garett had a hat-trick of sacks in the first half, two of them in the red zone to end drives and one forcing a fumble. He finished with seven pressures, one of them flushing Drake Maye from the pocket and forcing the quarterback into an interception.Garrett is a one-man avalanche. But watching him annihilate the Patriots while the Browns are blown out on the scoreboard felt like the perfect microcosm for his career. Do you think he regrets rescinding hisoffseason trade requestin exchange for a bumper payday? Garrett cited a “desire to win” when he asked out of Cleveland. Nothing has changed since then, except for his market-resetting contract. Even when he puts together a historic performance, the Browns cannot hang with upper-tier teams.Video of the weekWhen your team’s ownerpublicly criticizesyour ability to throw the forward pass, what do you do? You call for yourrunning backto throw the ball with the game on the line, obviously. That’s what Aaron Glenn and the Jets did to complete a comeback, 39-38 win over the Bengals.Breece Hall double clutches and throws a touchdown to Mason Taylor!NYJvsCIN on CBS/Paramount+https://t.co/HkKw7uXVntpic.twitter.com/yQ6gDM4nen— NFL (@NFL)October 26, 2025The chutzpah!After Woody Johnson’s critique, Justin Fields put together his most efficient game of the season, completing 65% of his passes. That may say more about the Bengals’ defense than the Jets’ offense, but Fields was able to take advantage of Cincy’s ropey group in the fourth quarter, leading three touchdown drives in the fourth quarter.Credit to Glenn, too. Down 14 late in the game, the Jets scored and then went for two. The initial try was ruled short, but Glenn challenged the ruling and it was overturned, making it a six-point game. Both decisions – going for it and the challenge – paid off, with the late touchdown allowing the Jets to kick an extra point to take the lead.Glenn has had a touch of Nathaniel Hackett-itis early in his head coaching tenure. He has consistently bungled the clock and mismanaged his timeouts. But with his team staring down another disappointing loss, he took the gutsy, albeitanalytically minded move, and it hit.Elsewhere around the leagueView image in fullscreenJosh Allen was in the middle of the action, as usual.Photograph: Erik Verduzco/APIt was another historic day for Josh Allen. He became only the second quarterback in league history with 70 career rushing touchdowns, rushing for two scores as the Bills beat the Panthers 40-9. Coming off a bye, the Bills’ offense was stodgy early. But their defense forced turnovers, and the offensive line manhandled the Panthers. Bye weeks are a time for teams to self-scout. It feels notable that Buffalo opted to run their offense through their two most reliable options: running back James Cook and receiver Khalil Shakir. The pair combined for 304 yards and three touchdowns on 25 touches. It wound up a blowout. But the usage of Cook and Shakir signaled that the Bills will be active before the trade deadline, hunting for another explosive receiver.There was more tush-push controversy in Philadelphia. On fourth-and-one, Jalen Hurts leapt forward on the push and reached the ball out to clear the line to gain. As he reached, the ball was ripped out by the Giants’ Kayvon Thibodeaux. But the officials blew the whistle for forward progress, canceling out Thibodeaux’s turnover.You can't possibly call this forward progress and call the play dead. You just can't.He's literally getting pushed. The point of the TUSH PUSH.Everything about how this is being officiated is rough.pic.twitter.com/121n8uO815— Jordan Schultz (@Schultz_Report)October 26, 2025It was a ridiculous call. The shove already has enough ingrained advantages without officials calling forward progress on a playdesignedto have a player pushed forward. It eliminates any risk for Hurts when he reaches out for the first-down marker. Add that to missingblatant false starts, and the play becomes literally indefensible. If Thibodeaux’s rip is not a fumble, then the case against the push will no longer be about the spirit of the play (a laughable claim, anyway) but rather that the officials and the rulebook are not equipped to handle it.The Jets’ win was overshadowed bythe death of their longtime centerNick Mangold, who was seeking a kidney transplant, at the age of 41. Mangold spent his entire career with the Jets and was universally popular across the NFL thanks to his humor and approachability. He was also an excellent player: a seven-time Pro Bowler, a two-time All-Pro and a strong candidate for induction in the hall of fame. He was married with four children. “One of the kindest people I’ve ever met,” wrote former Jets running back Thomas Jones on social media. “One of the greatest interior linemen to ever play the game.”The Colts wagon rolled to 7-1 behind another huge day from Jonathan Taylor. Indy’s running back scored three touchdowns in a 38-14 win over the Titans, marking the fourth time this year he’s scored three touchdowns in a game. Eight weeks in, Taylor should sit near the top of any MVP standings.The Cowboys were thumped 44-22 by the Broncos. For the first time this season, Dak Prescott looked frazzled, struggling to break down Denver’s blitz-and-disguise defense. With the offense struggling, Dallas had no chance. The defense spent another Sunday afternoon struggling to slow down the run, rarely worrying the quarterback, missing tackles, blowing assignments and failing to cover anyone down the field. It feels like the masterplan of fielding a mini-Bengals in the NFC is not going to work.The Giants lost running back Cam Skattebo, who had become a cult hero in his rookie season, to a gruesome ankle injury in their defeat to the Eagles. He will almost certainly miss the rest of the season. “I saw him on the ground with his leg trapped,” said Giants offensive lineman Greg Van Roten. “When he pulled it out, you could see his foot was the wrong way. Obviously, that is not normal. I just wanted him to stay down, called the trainers out, get the cart. Put the [ankle] back basically. It’s hard to see stuff like that.”How about the Ravens? They were without Lamar Jackson againafter the quarterback was a late scratch, but found enough from Snoop Huntley to coast past the Bears 30-16. Baltimore’s defense finally turned up, stymying Chicago’s resurgent run game and holding Caleb Williams to a 44% success rate. It was a must-win for the Ravens, who are now 2-5 after anightmarish start to the year.Explore more on these topicsAaron RodgersNFLGreen Bay PackersPittsburgh SteelersUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They said he spoke too much; they replied that, yeah, theywouldsee him outside; they told him talk is cheap. And that was just the players: there was more from the preachers in their pulpits, men who never lose.On the eve of the clásico, the teenager who claims he left fear behind in Mataró suggested that Real Madrid rob and moan, or so it goes. He also offered a reminder thatthe last time he had been at the Santiago Bernabéu– a kid withblaugranabraces, a glint in his eye and a right foot they didn’t know he had –he beat them 4-0. But that was then and this was now. And, an adult now, exactly a year on,he was beaten back. He knew, they told him so.Bellingham scores clásico winner as Real Madrid pull clear of BarcelonaRead moreWhen the final whistle went on a wild, intense 262nd clásico that was a little like old times, as Lamine Yamal and Dani Carvajal came together post game, Madrid’s captain did the old jibber-jabber gesture. It had been hard enough keeping up with everything that happened in the 105 minutes that went before, a match of 38 shots, three goals scored and three more disallowed; now it was impossible.Suddenly there were players everywhere, racing in and out of sight and piling in, police pulling people apart. In the middle of the melee, Thibaut Courtois was accepting the invitation to continue this down the tunnel. Vinícius was being held back,himtelling someoneelsethey talk to much. Raphinha was running to stop his countryman, Antonio Rüdiger there too. “It was like when we young,” Aurélien Tchouaméni said.In April, Tchouaméni had written: “They celebrate our defeats like we will never win again. We’ll be back.” Madrid had just lost aclásico Copa del Rey final 3-2in extra time, a collective breakdown greeting the final whistle, ice cubes flying. A fortnight later, they were beaten again. In four clásicos, Madrid had lost four times, league, cup and Super Cup going to their rivals. They had conceded four, five, three and four. But there is always tomorrow and it turned out Tchouaméni was right.Only once had Barcelona ever won five clásicos in a row, Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking run concluding withthat5-0against José Mourinho’s side, and it wouldn’t happen again. On Sunday, Madrid ended Hansi Flick’s perfect record in charge, beating Barcelona 2-1 to go five points clear at the top of the table.Madrid had needed this. The celebration said so, players dancing in circles. So did the noise, the Bernabéu louder and more edgy than on a clásico day for years: “incredible,” Jude Bellingham called it. The coach said so too. Asked if this was a weight off his shoulders, if there had been a psychosis around important matches, an obsession, Xabi Alonso shot back: “That’s you lot’s thing.” But he did admit that this was “not just three points, but where we come from and what it means to us; the boys needed that feeling of winning a big game.”View image in fullscreenDani Carvajal doesn’t miss the opportunity to taunt Lamine Yamal after the final whistle.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesLast season Madrid had not won any. Fourteen times they were defeated: Lille, Milan, Liverpool, Athletic, Espanyol, Betis, Atlético, Valencia and Arsenal all beat them. There wasn’t a single win against a truly big side. Carlo Ancelotti went and was replaced by Alonso but it continued. Madrid won five games at the Club World Cup, signs of a structure emerging, an idea, butthen came Paris Saint Germain.That belongs to last season, Alonso said. But the next season,hisseason, started with six wins in a row until Atlético came andputfivepast them. It was all well and goodbeating Oviedo, Mallorca and Osasuna but what about the big teams? Now at last they had beaten one of them too. And it wasn’t just that Madrid won, it was the way they won.Barcelona had players out: Joan García, Gavi, Dani Olmo, Robert Lewandowski and Andreas Christensen were all missing. So too Raphinha,whose significancemay at least be fully recognised in absentia. Others weren’t fully fit, Jules Koundé and Lamine Yamal among them. On the bench they had five players who hadn’t started a league game, two more who had started only once; two 17-year-olds, four 18-year-olds and two who are 19. And a centre-back, Ronald Araújo, whoended it up front again. Even their manager was missing, Flick suspended and stuck in a radio cabin. Marcus Sorg, his assistant, has been on the touchline three times: he has lost all of them.Much is made of Barcelona’s vulnerable high line, but they did not attack well on Sunday. Of all the things that were said to Lamine Yamal on Sunday, perhaps the most telling came from Vinícius during the game, taunting the teenager by telling him: “You’re all backwards passes.” As for that backline, more porous than before with Iñigo Martínez leaving, the pressure on passers dropping and the timing off, Levante made six clear chances against them,Rayo five,Sevilla five, Girona three. Last year theycaught Kylian Mbappé offside eight timesin an open clásico; yet, lost amid the defeats, was that in the last meetinghe got a hat-trick, Madrid always likely to get opportunities now.Quick GuideLa Liga resultsShowReal Sociedad 2-1 Sevilla, Girona 3-3 Oviedo, Espanyol 1-0 Elche, Athletic Club 0-1 Getafe, Valencia 0-2 Villarreal, Mallorca 1-1 Levante, Real Madrid 2-1 Barcelona, Osasuna 2-3 Celta Vigo, Rayo Vallecano 1-0 AlavésMondayReal Betis v Atlético Madrid (8pm GMT)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Playing like this, especially. This was a start as well as an end in itself. “In the future we’re going to need a lot of what we did today,” Alonso said. They put the ball in the net five times – three ruled out for offside – missed a penalty, took 23 shots and scored twice, the surprise that it was only that many. Mbappé got one, from just right of the centre again, the doubt about he and Vinícius occupying the same, left-sided spaces allayed. Bellingham got the other. “A tap-in,” he said afterwards, speaking in Spanish. “People say it’s easy but it’s about how I understand the game.” Wojciech Szczesny madeninesaves.For an hour or so, Madrid went forBarcelona, chances happening quicker than you could note them down. They pressed all the way to Szczesny; from his feet and those of the full-backs, the ball tended to be given back to them. They didn’t let Pedri play, Eduardo Camavinga taking particular responsibility. Bellingham was superb, scoring one, setting up the other with a wonderful turn and pass, and forcing the penalty.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham scored one and assisted the other in Real Madrid’s 2-1 win.Photograph: Susana Vera/ReutersIf intermittent, Vinícius went at Koundé, described in one paper as “defending like a security guard at the Louvre” – although attention was drawn more to the Brazilian’s furious reaction to being substituted, stomping off and straight down the tunnel on 71 minutes shouting: “I’ll leave the team.”That was about the time that the pace dropped and Barcelona took control. But while Pedri led and Lamine Yamal came inside, little really came of it. “We didn’t suffer much,” Carvajal insisted. And if a glorious pass from Lamine Yamal should have set up Koundé, who miscontrolled on his chest, and if Carvajal took a risk barging over Araújo, the better chances remained Madrid’s. All the way to the moment when Lamine Yamal was definitively defeated and it all kicked off.It had started with the YouTuber Ibai Llanos suggesting Porcinos were the Kings League’s Real Madrid, but it wasn’t going to end there. Lamine Yamal, an 18-year-old sitting with a bunch of mates in a streamer’s studio previewing a seven-a-side league for influencers and celebrities – silliness and shit-stirring as standard –laughed and replied: “Yeah, they rob, they moan.” That was followed, as the storm started, by an Instagram post of him at the Bernabéu last year: he stands blurred, defeated fans in sharp focus behind him. The message was clear: he was not about to back down.It was like Lamine Yamal. Heavy is the head that wears the crown but he likes taking the pressure for himself,performing his own coronationafter every goal. It’s not bragging if you can back it up, as Muhammad Ali said, and no one seemed to mind whenhe put Adrien Rabiot in checkmate. Not everyone saw the funny side this time, those who live by confrontation and noise handing out lessons in ethics and etiquette, a single line soon the centre of everything. In the pre-match press conference, when Alonso was asked about it for thefourthtime despite not saying anything to the first three, dismissing talk of extra motivation what with it being a clásico, he replied: “This again?”Twenty-four hours later, victory secured and asked about it again, Madrid’s manager rightly noted: “I don’t want to take the focus from what truly matters,” but fear not: everyone else would do that. “I’m the one who caused all this fuss,” Llanos lamented. Frenkie de Jong called the fallout “exaggerated”, insisted that Lamine Yamal hadn’t explicitly said Madrid were robbers, and that Carvajal could always call him rather than make gestures on the pitch. As for Tchouaméni, he smiled and said: “I like it. It’s only words; there’s no bad intentions. If he wants to talk, no problem.”Between them, they had cut through the bullshit, only it wasn’t just bullshit any more. It was there and it mattered to some. “Talk is cheap,”Bellingham wrote on Instagramwhen it was all over, Elvis Presley’s “A Little Less Conversation” accompanying his post. Madrid had been waiting to win at last and waiting for Lamine Yamal too, fans and players. Now he had lost as they could speak, the roar that little louder, the release that little greater. The rivalry even, something like it used to be. And what, the former Madrid midfielder Guti asked, is this game without a ruckus? “In those years back then, it all happened,” Alonso said. “It’s football, it’s the clásico.”PosTeamPGDPts1Real Madrid1012272Barcelona1013223Villarreal108204Espanyol103185Atletico Madrid96166Real Betis95167Rayo Vallecano102148Elche101149Athletic Bilbao10-11410Getafe10-21411Sevilla1011312Alaves1001213Celta Vigo10-21014Osasuna10-31015Levante10-4916Mallorca10-4917Real Sociedad10-4918Valencia10-6919Oviedo10-12720Girona10-137Explore more on these topicsLa LigaEuropean club footballBarcelonaReal MadridfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This year, with four meetings remaining, the title run-in reaches its decisive phase with a three-way fight between the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and the Red Bull ofMax Verstappen. Divining the outcome is a decidedly tricky affair.As recently asthe Dutch GP in Augustit appeared a two-way battle between the McLaren drivers would decide it. However, with Red Bull managing to apply upgrades that have unlocked the performance of the RB21, the equation is far more complex. Their car can now be as good, if not better, than the McLaren but the margins are small and neither team can be entirely sure who will have the edge on a given weekend.It makes for a fascinating finale, one made all the more intriguing by the human factor. Norris leads the championship by one point from Piastri, with Verstappen 36 points off the lead. Were the three protagonists on similar points it would be all but impossible not to back Verstappen’s experience and ruthless execution to see him through. As it is he still needs a little fortune in the form of DNFs or both McLarens having a terrible weekend.In the absence of this, it is Norris who carries the experience over his teammate and has been on much better form in recent races, which has perhaps given him just enough momentum to edge him over the line.São Paulo Grand PrixInterlagos, 9 NovemberLast year’s winnerMax VerstappenThe majestic, sweeping circuit in São Paulo should favour the McLaren. A mix of opening and closing fast sectors with a tight midsection, the high altitude allows teams to run a higher downforce setup. McLaren have enjoyed a strong aero-efficiency and should excel in the medium to high-speed corners on the quick sections of the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, if it is dry.However, last year in the wet Verstappen gave another masterclasscoming from 17th to win the race, in one of his greatest performances. It all but sealed his fourth title which he delivered at the next round in Las Vegas. The Red Bull is more competitive now than it was at this point last year and rain is expected over the weekend in São Paulo. With a sprint race thrown in, Brazil could once more be pivotal in turning the title race. In the wet it will be advantage Verstappen while the two McLaren drivers must ensure they make no mistakes.Predicted winnerVerstappenLas Vegas Grand PrixLas Vegas Strip Circuit, 23 NovemberLast year’s winnerGeorge RussellThe preponderance of straights on the street circuit of Vegas make for a low-downforce track and that combined with slow corners and cold temperatures all mitigate against McLaren who have had a poor record here since the race was first held in 2023. Neither driver has qualified or finished higher than sixth.The track layout does not play to the strengths of the MCL39 and similarly the cool temperatures mitigate its tyre management advantage. Mercedes and Ferrari in contrast have found Vegas suited to their cars and they will expect to be fighting at the front once more. However, since Red Bull’s aero overhaul they have been enormously strong on the low-downforce tracks and with their ability to now run at a lower ride height too, of the title contenders Verstappen will expect to win big on the Strip.Predicted winnerVerstappenQatar Grand PrixLusail International Circuit, 30 NovemberLast year’s winnerVerstappenA meeting with the final sprint race of the season so another opportunity for a potential swing, McLaren would consider this very much in their wheelhouse. A fast track dominated by flowing high-speed long corners, requiring a reasonably high downforce.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen celebrates with his Red Bull team after winning in Qatar last year.Photograph: Peter Fox/Getty ImagesYet last year having taken a one-two in the sprint, both McLarens failed to deliver in the race. They qualified poorly and Norris was given a penalty for failing to slow under yellows in the race, taking him out of contention. Red Bull in contrast hooked up their car pretty much perfectly and Verstappen delivered. This season they would expect to at least be nipping at the heels of McLaren if not better but Norris and Piastri will expect to emerge on top in Qatar.Predicted winnerPiastriAbu Dhabi Grand PrixYas Marina Circuit, 7 DecemberLast year’s winnerLando NorrisA circuit that must be considered all but perfect for the McLaren, which may be crucial if, as expected, this fight goes to the wire. Straights and fast corners favour their aero efficiency as does the smooth surface and the absence of some of the slower, tight turns removed with the reconfiguration of 2021.Norris won from pole last year to seal the constructors’ championship for McLaren, but again the team are unlikely to enjoy such an advantage over Red Bull this time and Verstappen has won four of the last five races in Abu Dhabi. If it is the title decider and if it is close, it may be a matter of who can hold their nerve when it counts to close it out.Predicted winnerNorrisPredicted 2025 drivers’ championNorrisExplore more on these topicsFormula One 2025Lando NorrisOscar PiastriMax VerstappenMcLarenRed BullFormula OneanalysisShareReuse this content"

Now the league is getting its dueRead moreA pair of indictments were unsealed last week and nearly three dozen people – most notably, Billups and Rozier – were arrested by federal officials.Rozier was arrested because federal officials allege he conspired with associates to help them win bets based on his statistical performance in a 2023 game. The charges are similar to those former Toronto player Jontay Porter faced before he was banned from the league by its commissioner, Adam Silver, in 2024.Sportsbooks detected unusual patterns of wagers on the game in question – prop bets involving Rozier were flagged and immediately brought to the NBA’s attention – and the league investigated the matter but did not find enough evidence to conclude that Rozier broke any rules.“While the unusual betting on Terry Rozier’s ‘unders’ in the March 2023 game was detected in real time because the bets were placed legally, we believe there is more that can be done from a legal/regulatory perspective to protect the integrity of the NBA and our affiliated leagues,” the league told its teams. “In particular, proposition bets on individual player performance involve heightened integrity concerns and require additional scrutiny.”The league will also look at injury reports. The NBA publishes an injury report every hour, and teams are required to disclose statuses of players within certain windows of time before their next game. The NBA added the injury report several years ago in the interest of transparency.The injury statuses can be used by bettors to decide which wagers to make – and if gamblers get that information before the rest of the public, it’s tantamount to insider trading. Former NBA player Damon Jones faces charges because officials said he tipped off bettors about the health status of two Los Angeles Lakers players. The details in that indictment clearly show that Jones was discussing the availability of LeBron James and former Lakers center Anthony Davis with bettors before their statuses for certain games was known publicly. There is no indication that James or Davis had any knowledge of what Jones was alleged to be doing.There were other examples of such tipping with other clubs, federal officials said.“With sports betting now occupying such a significant part of the current sports landscape, every effort must be made to ensure that players, coaches, and other NBA personnel are fully aware of the dire risks that gambling can impose upon their careers and livelihoods; that our injury disclosure rules are appropriate; and that players are protected from harassment from bettors,” the memo said.The league also said it is seeking input from teams, if they have any ideas on how to best proceed going forward.Explore more on these topicsNBAGamblingBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Sunday’s victory over Crystal Palace was Mikel Arteta’s side’s third by that margin in nine Premier League games. Last season, Arsenal managed that result five times in the league, while also drawing 1-1 in seven matches. Clean sheets in just half of those might have made for an intriguing title race. For all the noise surrounding Arsenal’s attacking talent, their defence is just as vital. It is their solidity at that end of the pitch that will probably lead them to glory, with three goals conceded in nine top-flight games so far. Sunday also marked a century of games across all competitions since they have conceded more than twice. The last to put three past David Raya? Luton – remember them? – backin December 2023.Sam DallingMatch report:Arsenal 1-0 Crystal PalaceView image in fullscreenDavid Raya and Gabriel Magalhães congratulate each other after Arsenal’s latest clean sheet.Photograph: Clive Mason/Getty Images2Elliott must wait for a chanceAston Villa earned a statement victory against Manchester City to make it four straight top-flight wins but Harvey Elliott, who joined from Liverpool last month in search of game time, was a high profile absentee. Unai Emery explained Elliott’s performances across a total of 167 minutes in a Villa shirt simply did not warrant a place in the matchday squad, particularly given the return to form of Morgan Rogers and the rebirth of Emiliano Buendía, who was forced off against City approaching the half-hour and left Villa Park on crutches. Elliott was withdrawn at half-time on his sole league start for Villa, against his former club Fulham last month, and last featured as a 86th-minute substitute at Feyenoord at the start of October. Elliott left Anfield in search of regular minutes but has found them hard to come by. “I spoke with him about it,” Emery said. “My advice was: keep going. He is a very good player. Our demands are on a high level. He needs time to work and wait for his moment.”Ben FisherMatch report:Aston Villa 1-0 Man City3Kayode offers more than long throwsThe temptation with a player such as Michael Kayode is to overprioritise the aspect of the game at which he is exceptional, which is to say his long throws. But even without the prodigious distance he can hurl a ball, the 21-year-old Italian is an extremely promising full-back. He has the physicality and energy of the modern defender and, while it may be more chaotic than graceful, his dribbling style is effective. Again and again against Liverpool, his forward surges carriedBrentfordout of trouble and created opportunities. Sometimes he ended up on the left and never seemed entirely comfortable shooting with his left foot, but Kayode did play two important passes, two-thirds of his crosses found a Brentford player and he ended up with a passing accuracy of 87%. He has started every league game, allowing Kristoffer Ajer to move to the left, with Keane Lewis-Potter becoming an option off the bench.Jonathan WilsonMatch report:Brentford 3-2 Liverpool4Mbeumo and Cunha clicking for UnitedAfter Bryan Mbeumo’s double tookManchester Unitedto a third consecutive Premier League win on Saturday night, the forward said he was aiming to emulate last season’s 20 league goals for Brentford – or do even better. “I try to not set limits on myself, on what I can reach. I’m just going to work and try to do as best as possible,” said the Cameroon international, who has four goals in nine league appearances, and five in 10 in all competitions for United. Matheus Cunha’s fine opener from distance against Brighton was the Brazilian’s first goal, 10 games in for Ruben Amorim’s team, easing pressure on him. “I think he took some off his shoulders today,” Mbeumo said. “He was waiting for it. We were waiting for it for him as well. So we are very happy for him.”Jamie JacksonMatch report:Manchester United 4-2 Brighton5Van de Ven steps up for SpursWithout the services of the injured captain, Cristian Romero, among others, there were concerns from Tottenham fans that they might lose their undefeated road record at Everton. They need not have worried as the Dutch giant Micky van de Ven stepped into the Romero-shaped void and more than filled it. Van de Ven was handed the captain’s armband at Hill Dickinson Stadium and the 6ft 4in defender responded by muscling in two headers from set plays to take his tally to five goals in all competitions. Perhaps concerningly, he is now out on his own as Tottenham’s top scorer this season. Van de Ven was also required to show the kind of basic defensive instincts that Spurs lacked under Ange Postecoglou. As part of a back line that made 53 clearances, Van de Ven excelled. Playing on the road suits Thomas Frank’s team. They do not need to make the running, can sit in defensively and fall back on set pieces for their threat. At home againstChelseaon Saturday, Spurs and Van de Ven will need to show their more expansive side, especially if Romero is still absent.Tom BassamMatch report:Everton 0-3 TottenhamView image in fullscreenTottenham’s Micky van de Ven scores the first of his two goals at Everton.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters6Chelsea feel Palmer’s absence in defeatThis was the first time Chelsea have properly felt the absence of Cole Palmer this season. They have mostly coped well during the playmaker’s absence with a persistent groin problem but they needed his ingenuity during their 2-1 home defeat against Sunderland. João Pedro, operating in Palmer’s No 10 position, was poor and has been out of form for a while, while Enzo Maresca’s wide players were largely blunt and predictable. “We didn’t create a lot,” said the Chelsea manager, who continues to encounter problems against teams who set up with low blocks. The hosts did not move the ball with enough speed and they ran out of ideas long before the end, and Sunderland’s stoppage-time winner. The concern with Maresca is that his football sometimes becomes rigid and formulaic. Palmer has the imagination to open up stubborn defences by altering angles and doing the unexpected. He was missed on Saturday; Chelsea are eagerly awaiting his return.Jacob Steinbergskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His energy in midfield was a leading reason for Nottingham Forest finding space so tight, and it was his robbing of Elliot Anderson that led to Junior Kroupi scoring the second, clinching goal. Alongside him, Alex Scott was given free hand to add his loose-limbed creativity to attack. Where last season, Iraola was often down to bare bones, at one point capable of fielding only 12 senior players, he now has options for the battles ahead. Ryan Christie and Lewis Cook, previous constants, were kept in reserve. “I have to take even more difficult decisions,” said a manager granted the novel luxury of choice – “internal competition”, as he termed it. On current form, his performance against Forest the latest demonstration of his box-to-box capabilities, Adams appears to be an easy selection.John BrewinMatch report:Bournemouth 2-0 Nottingham Forest8Win on the road boosts Clarets’ hopesNow five points clear of the bottom three,Burnleypicked up their first away win this season at Molineux. For a side that set a second-tier record on the road last season with 49 points and 14 wins, fans might have hoped it would not take the Clarets this long to secure points away from Turf Moor in the top flight. That being said, Scott Parker’s side conceded 16 goals in 46 games last season; they have leaked one more so far this season in 37 fewer matches. Such is the difference in level between the two divisions, but that does not have to be a negative for Burnley. Three important points, taken right at the death after losing a two-goal lead, adds to the tally and puts them in 16th – eight points above their winless opponents.Peter LansleyMatch report:Wolves 2-3 BurnleyView image in fullscreenBurnley players celebrate after Lyle Foster’s late winner at Molineux.Photograph: Nigel French/PA9Shirt-pulling is still going uncheckedAt the start of this season, there was a big song and dance about referees supposedlyclamping down on holding and shirt-pulling. The clocks have only just gone back but that initiative seems to have gone the way of the late summer sun. Anyone seeking confirmation of this only needed to be at St James’ Park on Saturday to see Nick Woltemade’s shirt tugged so hard, and so persistently, by Fulham’s Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey that the only surprise was the fabric did not tear. The Newcastle centre-forward’s gangly 6ft 6in frame – allied to his preference for wearing slightly oversized tops – dictates there is plenty of shirt for his markers to pull, but surely referees should be offering Woltemade more protection? The German’s technical skills are a joy to watch and he should have been afforded more freedom to express them on a day when Bruno Guimarães’s 90th-minute goal secured Eddie Howe’s side a much needed win, and consigned Fulham to a fourth straight defeat.Louise TaylorMatch report:Newcastle 2-1 Fulham10Calvert-Lewin proving an asset for LeedsGoals are hard to come by for Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has scored only once since joining Leeds on a free transfer this summer. However, the former Everton striker has quickly become critical to Daniel Farke’s structure and style of play, despite his struggles in front of goal. Sending direct passes down the pitch for Calvert-Lewin to either hold up or flick on was a regular feature of the victory against West Ham. It helped relieve the pressure the visitors were putting Leeds under, offering an ideal outlet. There is plenty of focus on set pieces under Farke and Calvert-Lewin is a constant threat when the ball is sent into the box. Out of contract at Everton, Calvert-Lewin took a long time to find a new club but he may have found the right one at Elland Road. He offered plenty of endeavour on Friday but did not receive the level of service a striker needs to thrive. If he can add goals soon, he will become an even greater asset.Will UnwinMatch report:Leeds 2-1 West HamPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal913222AFC Bournemouth95183Tottenham Hotspur910174Sunderland94175Man City910166Man Utd91167Liverpool92158Aston Villa91159Chelsea961410Crystal Palace931311Brentford901312Newcastle911213Brighton9-11214Everton9-31115Leeds9-51116Burnley9-51017Fulham9-5818Nottm Forest9-12519West Ham9-13420Wolverhampton9-122Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen talking points from the weekend footballArsenalAston VillaBrentfordManchester UnitedTottenham HotspurChelseafeaturesShareReuse this content"

By way of immediate response the club’s main – and typically publicity-shy – shareholder, Dermot Desmond, has remarkably unleashed on what he branded “self-serving” behaviour by Rodgers. In a further dramatic twist and two decades after leaving the club, Martin O’Neill will return to take charge of Celtic on an interim basis.Celtic confirmed Rodgers had left his position shortly before 10pm on Monday. O’Neill, assisted by Shaun Maloney, will preside over Wednesday’s visit of Falkirk to Celtic Park. Celtic then face Rangers in the League Cup semi-final at Hampden Park on Sunday. It is far from impossible O’Neill will be given an extended run in charge. Ange Postecoglou has been installed as the early favourite and is availableafter leaving Nottingham Forest. The likelihood of the Australian returning to Glasgow has been played down by those close to Celtic.Football Daily | Why Hearts’ historic title tilt shouldn’t come as a surpriseRead moreIt will, however, take considerable time for the dust to settle on the circumstances behind Rodgers’s exit. His final match was Sunday’s3-1 defeat against Heartsat Tynecastle, which leaves Celtic eight points from the summit of Scotland’s top flight. Rodgers had made plain his disquiet over a lack of summer transfer activity, sentiment his paymasters clearly believe fuelled supporter protests aimed at the board.Within 15 minutes of Celtic’s official statement on Rodgers, Desmond issued a savage one of his own. “I want to acknowledge Brendan’s contribution across his two spells as manager, during which he helped deliver success that forms part of the club’s modern history,” said the Irish tycoon. “However, I must also express my deep disappointment at the way the past several months have unfolded.“When we brought Brendan back to Celtic two years ago, it was done with complete trust and belief in his ability to lead the club into a new era of sustained success. Unfortunately, his conduct and communication in recent months have not reflected that trust.View image in fullscreenMartin O’Neill previously managed Celtic from 2000-2005, winning the Scottish title three times.Photograph: Ben Curtis/PA“In June, both [the chief executive] Michael Nicholson and I expressed to Brendan that we were keen to offer him a contract extension, to reaffirm the club’s full backing and long-term commitment to him. He said he would need to think about it. Yet in subsequent press conferences, Brendan implied that the club had made no commitment to offer him a contract. That was simply untrue.” There appeared little chance of Rodgers extending his deal, which was due to end next summer.Desmond added: “Every player signed and every player sold during his tenure was done so with Brendan’s full knowledge, approval, and endorsement. Any insinuation otherwise is absolutely false.”Desmond insisted Rodgers was “given final say over all football matters” and disputed Celtic’s transfer approach has been poor. “When his comments were made publicly, I sought to address them directly,” said Desmond. “Brendan and I met for over three hours at his home in Scotland to discuss the issue. Despite ample opportunity, he was unable to identify a single instance where the club had obstructed or failed to support him. The facts did not match his public narrative.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club and fuelled hostility towards members of the executive team and the board. Some of the abuse directed at them, and at their families, has been entirely unwarranted and unacceptable.”After the loss at Hearts, Rodgers denied shifting the blame on to others. “I’ve always taken responsibility,” he said. “There’s never been a time that I haven’t. When you’re the manager at Celtic, you’re responsible for the results, despite whatever else happens. So that responsibility is on me.”Explore more on these topicsCelticBrendan RodgersMartin O'NeillScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

This season, for the first time, all games not played during the Saturday 3pm blackout are being shown live, but there is only one broadcast slot reserved for a Friday.Any Boxing Day fixture selection is likely to prove controversial, even if there is only one match, given the absence of most public transport. Despite a commitment to announce its TV picks for December and January by 15 October, the league has amended its fixture programme only until 22 December. The EFL has a full Boxing Day programme.The last time Boxing Day fell on a Friday, in 2014, there was a full round of top-flight games, with Raheem Sterling scoring for Liverpool in a 1-0 win against Burnley and Wayne Rooney recording a brace and an assist for Robin van Persie in a 3-1 Manchester United victory over Newcastle.

In this kind of incident, the referee awards a foul and then has to consider the criteria of what fits the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreThere are four factors, and they are really important: the distance from goal, whether the attacking player is in possession of the ball, their direction of travel and the number of covering defenders. The key detail here is that the likelihood of Minteh getting possession is very slim. The ball is rolling through to the goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, who would be able to pick it up. With that in mind, the on-field decision of yellow card is confirmed because the attacker has knocked the ball too far. The phraseology “last man” doesn’t come into play.An earlier incident involved Luke Shaw and Georginio Rutter in the buildup to United’s third goal, where Shaw appears to cause Rutter to lose control of possession by grabbing his shirt. There’s no question Shaw does have a little hold as the Brighton forward runs past him in the centre circle, but I think the important word here is “little”. It’s fleeting, it’s not sustained holding, and the way Rutter goes to ground does not fit with the contact made. He goes to ground theatrically to show the referee that he has been fouled but Anthony Taylor allows play to continue.Taylor had a really good view of this and the guidance this season has been to not penalise for minimal contact, only sustained holding so, in my opinion, this was the right decision. Bryan Mbeumo goes on to score at the end of the move, so the incident was looked at by the video assistant referee as part of the attacking phase of play (APP) in the buildup. What we’ve seen in the Premier League is that the window for looking at the APP is narrower now and we don’t want to be going back and re-refereeing, so this was a good quick check by the VAR, Michael Oliver, and the goal was allowed to stand.View image in fullscreenVirgil van Dijk makes contact with Dango Ouattara on the edge of the penalty area.Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty ImagesAtBrentford, there was plenty of discussion around penalty decisions. The first came early when Cody Gakpo went to ground in the Brentford penalty area. But James Collins, the Brentford defender, doesn’t challenge, he just plants his foot. Gakpo goes to ground very easily, he throws his arms in the air, his body language is suggesting he’s been fouled. It’s definitely not a penalty but the question is: did he try to deceive the referee? Should he have received a yellow card for simulation?There is an argument for that because of the theatrical action of Gakpo, though some people will say: no caution, play on. These are the fine margins in relation to simulation when there is minimal contact because you’ve got to start thinking about several things at once: is he avoiding contact? Is he initiating contact? Is it instigating contact? All of this happens in a split second. In this instance, there’s maybe slight contact but it’s so theatrical I think if a yellow card was awarded for simulation, you couldn’t have too many complaints.Also in this game, we have another incident that serves as a good educational piece, this one relating to the process of VAR and penalties. At half-time we have a change of referee where Tim Robinson, who was the fourth official, replaces Simon Hooper. Robinson comes on to the field and 15 minutes later sees Virgil van Dijk kick the bottom of Dango Ouattara’s foot. He blows the whistle and awards a free-kick to Brentford.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Quite clearly Van Dijk does catch Ouattara, so it was a foul and that is check complete. The second part is whether the contact is inside or outside the penalty area. Here, the key thing is that the line on the edge of the penalty area belongs to the goalkeeper. He could claim a cross on the line and it would not be handball; it’s part of the area. That’s relevant here because the contact is on the line and the check here is not a subjective call, it’s factual: is it inside or is it outside?That’s why Robinson doesn’t go to the monitor: you don’t need to when it’s a factual decision. What he does do is give the crowd a description of the incident, explaining that the offence occurred inside the penalty area and not outside, therefore resulting in a penalty kick.Chris Foy is a former Premier League refereeExplore more on these topicsRefereesLaws of footballManchester UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionBrentfordLiverpoolcommentShareReuse this content"

There are no friendlies in football. We want to win every game. We want to perform well.”Sarina Wiegman said she was looking forward to the meeting at Derby’s Pride Park. “They are a top-level team and will challenge us in the way we want to be challenged,” the head coach said. “I’m not really looking back at the World Cup semi-final – it was an incredible semi-final by the way. They have a new coach and we have moved on.”Eleven of the Australia squad named by Joe Montemurro for games against Wales and England are playing in the WSL. One of them, the Arsenal defender Steph Catley, said that would bring its advantages. “You play against them and know the strengths and weaknesses of each player,” she said. “I don’t think it changes it too much though.”Australia beat Wales 2-1 on Saturday, Sam Kerr starting for the first time since an anterior cruciate ligament injury sustained in January 2024. They have won two of Montemurro’s four games, defeating then drawing with Slovenia in June and losing to Panama in July, with England their first major test under the former Arsenal manager.England lost 2-1 to Brazil on Saturdayafter conceding first for the fourth time in as many games. In the preceding three, at the Euros, they came back and the team ended up lifting a second title. Wiegman denied there was an endemic problem.“In the Spain game we started well and we could have scored and taken a 1-0 lead,” she said ofthe final, before reflecting on other Euros matches. “In the Italy game we could have scored and taken a 1-0 lead. Inthe Sweden gamewe didn’t start that well. Inthe France gamewe started really well and they scored the first goal. So, I don’t agree that we always have slow starts. Last Saturday we didn’t start well enough. We had to get more physical. We talked about that in the review of the match. The players felt the same.

The season before that, all three promoted sides were relegated. The fear was that the gulf between the Premier League and Championship had become too big, with the increasing stratification of the English game essentially making it impossible for the promoted sides to survive, much less to thrive. It’s a self-perpetuating issue; the longer the other 17 remain in the Premier League, fattened on television rights, the harder it will be for teams coming up to make an impression.There was a need for the promoted sides to put up a better fight than they managed last season when, between them, Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton collected just 59 points. Nine games into this season, not quite a quarter of the way through, Sunderland, Leeds and Burnley already have 38 points between them. None of the three are currently in the relegation zone. But most striking have been the performances of Sunderland, who have taken 17 points already and, to widespread surprise, lie fourth in the table.Their fixture list, it should be said, has been kind. Looking at the table on Saturday morning, Sunderland had faced only one side in the top half. Starting with a home game against West Ham was about as gentle as introductions come. They faced Nottingham Forest when they were locked in thestrange Ange Postecoglou slump, and Aston Villa when they were still in their early-season funk. They’ve also beaten Brentford and Wolves at home.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s actionRead moreDefeat at Manchester United before the international break suggested they might struggle against better opponents, which was why Saturday’s game at Chelsea was so important. Could they win away? Could they challenge the elite? Was their positive start an illusion created by the fixture list? As they went 1-0 down inside four minutes, the signs were not good. But they battled back, equalized midway through the halfand won itwith a classic counterattack in injury-time. A smash-and-grab? Not really: Sunderland had the better xG.Against Villa when the left-back Reinildo was sent off and against United having gone 2-0 down, Sunderland had switched to three at the back. At Stamford Bridge, manager Régis Le Bris started with a 5-4-1, despite the injury to centre-back Omar Alderete, who has been perhaps their greatest triumph of recruitment, a tough but classy ball-playing centre-back discovered at Getafe. That meant Dan Ballard in the middle with Nordi Mukiele to his right (it’s frankly inexplicable that a central defender of such quality joined Sunderland from Paris Saint-Germain for just £9.5m ($12.6m) plus £2.5m ($3.3m) in potential add-ons) and the on-loan Lutsharel Geertruida to his left. Geertruida was a full-back in Arne Slot’s title-winning Feyenoord side in the Netherlands, and until Saturday had played in midfield for Sunderland.Having two players so comfortable on the ball in the back three allowed them to step up and form an extra man in midfield where necessary. The shape was 5-4-1, which Chelsea found extremely hard to break down, but it wasn’t a passive system. Rather, when Sunderland chose to press they did so with ferocious conviction, inspired by Noah Sadiki, whose remarkable stamina has drawn comparison with N’Golo Kanté. In a young side, midfielder Granit Xhaka has emerged as a real leader, a player of quality and incisiveness but also steel.Arsenal’s perfect weekend and Liverpool thrown into crisis – Football WeeklyRead moreSunderland have benefited, clearly, from spending £160m ($213m) on 13 permanent signings in the summer, although they also raised £45m ($60m) in sales, most notably Jobe Bellingham to Borussia Dortmund. But they have spent wisely. Last season, as he oversaw the second part of Southampton’s slide back into the Championship, Ivan Jurić observed that he had expected his players to be inferior technically and tactically, but he had been taken aback by how they had been physically overwhelmed. Sunderland seem to have been very aware of the potential issue, signing only notably powerful players.But that’s not to suggest they are only a physical side. Their preference, as it was in most of their better performances last season, is to sit deep, absorb pressure and play on the break. There is a clear plan and it says much for both the recruitment and Le Bris’s coaching that there has been so little apparent disruption despite the arrival of the wave of new signings.It’s extremely unlikely that Sunderland will remain fourth. Their fixture list in the second half of the first half of the season is much harder than in the first, they will lose perhaps as seven players to the Africa Cup of Nations and there probably will be some sort of regression to the mean. Realistically, though, they are probably only six wins from safety and that was always the primary goal – one that, evenamid the euphoriaof the playoff final win over Sheffield United in May, few fans seemed to believe possible.That’s not just good for Sunderland, but also for English football. After two seasons in which the promoted sides have barely even made up the numbers, reigniting the idea that a side can come up and actually have fun is vital for the pyramid.This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.Subscribe for free here.Have a question for Jonathan?

Wednesday are bottom on -6 points after the chair, Dejphon Chansiri, placed the club into administration last Friday,triggering an automatic 12-point penalty.Wednesday have failed to pay wages on time for five of the past seven months. An independent commission hearing will determine the sanction for the non-payment of March’s and May’s player wages. Wednesday are expected to be charged with further breaches this season, thought to relate to the non-payment of wages in June, July and September, for which they could also be docked points. If Wednesday are deducted further points, it is expected the penalties would apply this season.Dejphon Chansiri and everything that has gone wrong at Sheffield WednesdayRead moreKris Wigfield of the club’s administrator, Begbies Traynor, revealed a huge financial boost in the buildup to Wednesday’s defeat at home to Oxford after Chansiri in effect ended his 10-year reign. “Since the announcement, over £200,000 has been spent in the club shop, and we sold 9,000 tickets for the match in just 24 hours,” Wigfield said. “The kiosks were packed with fans buying food and beer, and every bit of that support matters more than you can imagine.”Wigfield said he has fielded interest from parties interested in acquiring Wednesday. The club and the EFL are hopeful of a quick sale. “Within the numerous inquiries we’ve had, we certainly think that there are already four or five interested parties that look like the real deal,” Wigfield said. “By the end of November, if things go well, we might know who’s going to buy the football club.”Wednesday, who are under five financial embargoes, are prohibited from paying fees for players until the summer of 2027 after breaching the 30-day rule for a second time. In June the EFL imposed a three-window fee restriction after the club exceeded 30 days of late payments between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025, and that has been extended after repeated breaches. Wednesday can appeal.The EFL served Wednesday a notice of withdrawal of membership on Friday, after the club entered administration, as per regulations, but immediately suspended the notice as work with the administrators moves towards a positive solution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, he was the voice of reason.While Antonio Conte debuted a new line of complaint, putting aside a career’s worth of laments about employers failing to back him in the transfer market to this time protest that Napoli had bought himtoo manynew players, McTominay said simply: “It’s football. You have to take it on the chin.”Juventus sack manager Igor Tudor after miserable eight-game winless runRead more“There’s always another game coming quick,” he continued. It just so happened that the next one, four days later, would be at home to the Inter side who Napoli pipped to theSerie Atitle last year.The timing was inauspicious. Napoli had lost their previous game, against Torino, as well. The defending champions were having a wobble, whereas Inter arrived on the back of seven consecutive wins in all competitions. As Conte would later put it: “They were coming here to kill us off.”An apt metaphor for the opening exchanges. Inter were hunting in packs, isolating Napoli’s defenders as they sought to play out from the back. Nicolò Barella pounced on Leonardo Spinazzola, dispossessing him and sending the ball to Lautaro Martínez, whose first-time shot demanded a save from Vanja Milinkovic-Savic at the near post.Inter’s tails were up, but they could not draw blood. Instead, they were stung by a bad refereeing decision at the other end. Frank Anguissa’s artful flick released Giovanni Di Lorenzo into the area, but the latter player was put under pressure by Henrikh Mkhitaryan before being dispossessed by Francesco Acerbi. The referee, Maurizio Mariani, well positioned, saw no infringement. Play continued back up towards halfway.But the linesman Daniele Bindoni believed he had seen Mkhitaryan impede Di Lorenzo. Replays suggested this was, at best, six of one and half a dozen of the other, but Mariani accepted his assistant’s verdict and pointed to the spot. Italy’s refereeing designator, Gianluca Rocchi, had spoken again last week about wanting to see fewer “rigorini” – borderline penalties – awarded, yet here was another in a high-profile game.Kevin De Bruyne converted, then immediately clutched his right hamstring. He left the pitch in tears, Napoli’s delight made bittersweet. The club confirmed on Monday that the Belgian suffered “a high-grade tear in his right thigh” and he is reportedly set to be out for several months.View image in fullscreenKevin De Bruyne faces another spell on the sidelines after reaggravating a hamstring injury he had surgery on in 2023.Photograph: Andrea Staccioli/Insidefoto/ShutterstockInter hit the post twice in the remaining minutes before the interval. Despite trailing, they had been the better team. Did the half-time pause undo them, allowing them time to stew over the penalty injustice? Inter’s president, Beppe Marotta, would later say that the decision “instilled a bitterness” in the players. “It impacted our approach in the second half.”Or maybe he was rationalising after the event. Because another event that shaped the game was the sensational goal scored by McTominay shortly after play resumed.Inter’s defence was complicit, allowing the Scot to run behind them on to a cross-field pass from Spinazzola. Still, by the time the ball came down, spinning awkwardly away from goal outside the box, the threat did not seem so great. Until he smashed it first-time back across his body and into the bottom corner of the net.An outrageous finish, straight from the pages of Roy of the Rovers. Another reminder of why he was named Serie A’s Most Valuable Player last season.Quick GuideSerie A resultsShowMilan 2-2 Pisa, Parma 0-0 Como, Udinese 3-2 Lecce, Napoli 3-1 Inter, Cremonese 1-1 Atalanta, Torino 2-1 Genoa, Verona 2-2 Cagliari, Sassuolo 0-1 Roma, Fiorentina 2-2 Bologna, Lazio 1-0 JuventusWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.He had made a slower start to this campaign. McTominay scored Napoli’s first goal on the opening weekend, away to Sassuolo, but had not found the net again for his club until last week’s defeat to PSV. He has been starting in a wider position since De Bruyne’s arrival, playing on the left of a 4-1-4-1 instead of forming part of a midfield three.That this latest goal should arrive after the Belgian left the pitch will only fuel debates about whether Napoli’s headline summer signing has hindered their most important player. For better or worse, though, the dilemma is likely to be set aside now for some time. De Bruyne underwent surgery on his right hamstring in 2023 but has continued to suffer injuries to that muscle since, and Napoli confirmed on Monday that he has a “high-grade lesion” and will be sidelined for several months.McTominay’s goal was not the final word on Saturday. Inter pulled one back within five minutes, winning a penalty of their own when Alessandro Buongiorno handballed. Hakan Calhanoglu buried the spot-kick, grabbed the ball and sprinted back toward halfway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But Inter had already lost theirs. A confrontation between Denzel Dumfries and the Napoli substitute Mathías Olivera escalated when Conte got involved, leading others to join in. The scuffle ended with Martínez throwing crude insults at his former manager and getting similar in return.View image in fullscreenAnger boiled over on the touchline as Antonio Conte (far right) could not help but exchange words with his former player Lautaro Martínez (far left) in Napoli’s win.Photograph: Piccirillo/ShutterstockMeanwhile, Napoli stayed on mission. From a throw-in at halfway, David Neres served a one-touch pass to Anguissa, who dribbled 30 yards, sidestepped two defenders and then wrongfooted everyone again with his finish. Another brilliant goal by a player whose centrality to Napoli’s success has not always received enough recognition.A 3-1 win delivered Napoli back to the top of the table, after Milan’s surprising draw at home to last-placed Pisa on Friday. Roma pulled level on 18 points after they beat Sassuolo on Sunday.The title race, for now, looks wide open, but this was a statement result for Napoli against opponents who Conte described as “the strongest team in the league”. On paper, and on the pitch, Inter had looked better in the early part of this season. But this defeat – even affected by a terrible refereeing decision – felt like a weighty one in what is becoming an increasingly bitter rivalry.Conte was sure to make the most of his moment, needling Inter for sending Marotta out to speak to the press afterwards. “Leave these things to those who participated in the match,” he said. “I have always defended myself. I have never asked my presidents to play ‘dad’.”Something of a historical rewrite there, from a man who complained several times while at Inter that he would like directors to come out andspeak to the press more. Maybe that too is intended, words chosen to get a reaction, another chance to get under his former club’s skin. Or perhaps Conte just loves a fight. He and Martínez famously fell out on the way to winning a league title together at Inter, before Romelu Lukaku got them together with some boxing gloves to throw afew fake punches and then hug it all out.He is hardly about to change his ways now, 20 years into a coaching career that has brought him six league titles, spread across four clubs and two countries. The great blessing for Conte at Napoli is that his fire can be balanced on the pitch by McTominay’s ice.“We had a great reaction after the Champions League defeat,” said the player on Saturday. “This was a great night. Top. And now what we need is continuity.”PosTeamPGDPts1Napoli87182Roma85183AC Milan87174Inter Milan88155Bologna86146Como84137Atalanta86128Juventus81129Udinese8-21210Lazio841111Cremonese8-11112Torino8-61113Sassuolo8-11014Cagliari8-2915Parma8-4716Lecce8-6617Verona8-7518Fiorentina8-5419Pisa8-7420Genoa8-73Explore more on these topicsSerie AEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sale, in contrast to the in-form Saints, are seventh in the Prem with two wins from five matches.Borthwick has a wealth of options in the back-line and the Northampton wing Tommy Freeman is being strongly considered to start at outside-centre. Mitchell backed his clubmate,who scored four tries against Saracenslast Friday, to thrive if he switches from the wing to No 13.“I think it will be good. He’s a quality player who has a lot of facets to his game with his power and how he works in the air,” Mitchell said. “His confidence is through the roof and his form is amazing. We knew when he came through the academy that he’s got everything: speed, power, height. He understands the game. We know if he puts that all together he’s one hell of a player.”The hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie has welcomed the “Test-match animal” Tom Curry, his Sale teammate, back into the England fold. Curry has recovered from having surgery on a wrist problem after the Lions tour and is in contention to start in the back row against the Wallabies.“He’s built differently,” said Cowan-Dickie, who will reach 50 England caps if he plays at Twickenham. “I think he showed that in the Lions. It’s a cliche: ‘He’s a Test-match animal,’ – but he is. For his game and mental approach, he could have not played for a year, and I’d still put him in my team.”Curry appeared six times for the British & Irish Lions in Australia but has missed the start of Sale’s domestic campaign due to the surgery. “He’s a workhorse,” Cowan-Dickie said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Would I be here today if I didn’t play through them? Maybe not. I think it’s made me robust.”Cowan-Dickie also said he is continuing to the feel benefits of giving up alcohol. “Loving it – I’ve not thought about once,” he said. “I don’t know how long it has been: 17 or 18 months, and I feel way better for it.

With his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri finishing only fifth and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in third, the Briton now leads Piastri by one point and Verstappen by 36. Piastri had held the title leadsince the Saudi Arabian Grand Prixbut Norris has moved to the front as the championship enters its final run-in.Lando Norris hits the front in title race with emphatic F1 Mexico City GP winRead moreHe has struggled for much of the season, particularly in qualifying, not enjoying the feel of the grip from the front axle as much as he would like while Piastri enjoyed a strong run of results. Norris has since made a concerted effort to adapt to it and has demonstrated very good form in recent races just as the Australian’s performances have dipped.“Certainly when the car was winning and Oscar was winning, the last thing I could do is use the excuse that my car is not good enough,” said Norris. “I wasn’t getting to grips and wasn’t finding a way to make it work, and I’m finding a better way to make it work now.“It’s as simple as that. Of course, it gives you good confidence.”McLaren’s team principal, Andrea Stella, noted that Norris excels in the low-grip conditions as was the case in Mexico and made the most if it, having been all but untouchable and felt the team as a whole had emerged well from the weekend especially after the recent resurgence in form of Verstappen and Red Bull.“It will just strengthen Lando’s confidence and it will be important for the final four races,” Stella said. “Both Lando and Oscar go into the final four races with reasons to be confident. The team also goes into the final four races with more understanding of how to extract performance from the car consistently.”He also felt both drivers and McLaren had every reason to expect to be competitive at the remaining meetings in Brazil, Las Vegas, Qatar and Abu Dhabi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His wife, Debra, was awarded $8m, according to a court document.A player’s foreseeable death raises existential questions for college footballRead moreA physician diagnosed Robert Geathers with dementia several years ago, The Times and Democrat newspaper in Orangeburg reported. Geathers now has trouble with day-to-day tasks such as dressing himself and helping making meals.Other physicians who testified at the trial said Geathers displayssymptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease found in former football players who received repeated blows to their heads while playing. CTE can be diagnosed only posthumously.The couple’s attorneys argued to jurors that blows Geathers took during practices and games for the historically Black school in Orangeburg caused trauma that didn’t show up until decades later, the newspaper reported.Geathers’s attorney, Bakari Sellers, said the NCAA knew about concussion risks since the 1930s, and when Geathers’s college career ended, but didn’t tell coaches or players about those risks until later.“All of the information they knew, they withheld,” Sellers told jurors, adding that “their job was to keep the boys safe.”The verdict can be appealed. In a statement released through a spokesperson, the NCAA said on Saturday that it disagreed with the verdict and that it was “prepared to pursue our rights on post-trial motions and on appeal, if necessary.”“The NCAA has prevailed in every other jury trial around the country on these issues,” and the South Carolina State team standards “followed the knowledge that existed at the time, and college football did not cause Mr Geathers’ lifelong health problems,” the statement said.NCAA trial attorney Andy Fletcher said at the trial that Geathers has several health conditions that influence dementia-like symptoms, and that the NCAA’s football rules committee is composed of representatives of member schools that could propose rules.“There’s going to be head-hits. That’s inherent to the game. You can’t take head-hits out of football,” Fletcher said in closing arguments.According to the newspaper, the jury determined the NCAA “unreasonably increased the risk of harm of head impacts to Robert Geathers over and above the risks inherent to playing football.” And it also determined the NCAA “voluntarily assumed duties to protect the health and safety of Robert Geathers” and that the NCAA “negligently breached their duties” to him.After the trial, Sellers said the result provided justice: “I felt good to hug Debra Geathers. She gets to go home and tell her husband some good news.”Explore more on these topicsConcussion in sportNCAACollege sportsCollege footballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The result was so dispiriting that fans in Tiger Stadium chanted “Fire Kelly”. Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, also weighed in on social media on Saturday night, writing: “I think @LSUSports and the LSU Board of Supervisors needs to rethink their actions to raise ticket prices for next year after tonight’s showing!”Bill Belichick built an empire on control. But UNC is letting chaos reign | Andrew LawrenceRead moreAccording to CBS Sports, Landry also was involved in Sunday’s discussions that led to Kelly’s ousting. Because LSU is part of the Louisiana State University System, Kelly is a public employee, and a part of his salary comes from public funds. However, most of his compensation comes from bonuses and incentives, which is derived from private sources such as donors and corporate sponsors.Kelly will be owed about $54m in a contract buyout,according to reports. He was in the fourth year of a 10-year contract worth around $100m.“We will continue to negotiate his separation and will work toward a path that is better for both parties,” Woodward said.The development is an awkward one for Woodward, who was Texas A&M’s athletic director when that university hired Jimbo Fisher, only to have tobuy him out for a historic $77mafter he struggled to win consistently during his six seasons there from 2018 to 2023.LSU (5-3, 2-3 Southeastern Conference) opened their season 4-0 to climb as high as No 3 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll, but the Tigers dropped three of their last four to fall out of the poll released on Sunday. It’s the second year in a row LSU have tumbled out of the Top 25 during the latter half of the season.Those nosedives are in sharp contrast to the successes of Kelly’s predecessors at LSU.Nick Saban went 13-1 and won the 2003 national championship in his fourth season, Les Miles went 12-2 and won the 2007 BCS Championship in his third season and Ed Orgeron went 15-0 before winning the College Football Playoff National Championship. Kelly, on the other hand, led the Tigers to the 2022 Citrus Bowl, the 2023 ReliaQuest Bowl and the 2024 Texas Bowl.“I will not compromise in our pursuit of excellence and we will not lower our standards,” said Woodward, an LSU graduate who was hired to his current post in 2019, the same year the Tigers won the national title under Orgeron.While Kelly did not coach LSU to a playoff berth, he oversaw quarterback Jayden Daniels’ development into a Heisman Trophy winner in 2023.The 64-year-old Kelly, who became Notre Dame’s winningest coach before jumping to Baton Rouge, becomes the third high-profile coach to be fired in as many Sundays after Penn State dismissed James Franklin on 12 October and Florida fired Billy Napier a week later.UCLA, Virginia Tech, Oklahoma State, Oregon State, Arkansas, UAB and Colorado State also have ousted their head coaches since this season began.Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsLouisiananewsShareReuse this content"

But with Elon Musk branding it ‘Wokipedia’ and AI looming large, can it survive?Mon 27 Oct 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 11.54 EDTShareWikipedia will be 25 years old in January. Jimmy Wales’s daughter will be 25 and three weeks. It’s not a coincidence: on Boxing Day 2000 Wales’s then wife, Christine, gave birth to a baby girl, but it quickly became clear that something wasn’t right. She had breathed in contaminated amniotic fluid, resulting in a life-threatening condition called meconium aspiration syndrome. An experimental treatment was available at the hospital near where they lived in San Diego. Did they want to try it?At the time, Wales was a former trader and internet entrepreneur in his mid-30s. He had co-founded a “guy-oriented search engine” called Bomis, but his real passion was encyclopedias. The money from Bomis had allowed him to found Nupedia, a free online encyclopedia written by experts – but it was proving slow to get off the ground. The laborious process of peer review meant that it only managed to generate 21 articles in its first year (among them “Donegal fiddle tradition” and “polymerase chain reaction”).Suddenly, Wales needed information, and fast. But as he searched for “meconium” on the wider web, desperate to make a better-informed decision about his daughter’s health, all he found was a mixture of first-hand accounts from strangers he had no way of evaluating and highly technical scientific papers he couldn’t understand. “It was like sifting through the debris of a bombed-out library,” he remembers. Ultimately, he and his then wife decided to trust the doctors and go with the new treatment. Their baby, Kira, pulled through. But that terrifying scramble made up his mind: Nupedia was never going to work – it was time for a different approach.We know the rest of the story: his new project, Wikipedia, founded on the principle that anyone could edit it, grew rapidly. By 2002, there were about25,000entries in the English version; by 2006, there were 1m. There are now more than 7m (the digital version of Encyclopedia Britannica has 100,000). Alongside this are 18foreign-languageversions of Wikipedia that have more than 1m articles each, ranging from Arabic to Vietnamese. It has become part of the plumbing of the internet – perhaps even more essential: Diane von Fürstenberg once told Wales that “we all use Wikipedia more often than we pee”.In an online landscape characterised by doom and division, it stands out: a huge, collective endeavour based on voluntarism and cooperation, with an underlying vision that’s unapologetically utopian – to build “a world where every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge”. It has weathered teething troubles (such as a “joke” edit that suggested a loyal aide to Robert F Kennedy was in fact involved inhis and his brother’s assassinations) to become a place in which civility and neutrality are the guiding stars, andlevels of accuracy matchthose of academic textbooks.Wales’s new book, The Seven Rules of Trust, is an attempt to distil the secrets of its success. They include things such as having a strong, clear, positive purpose (the slogan “Wikipedia is an encyclopedia” is a surprisingly powerful reminder that keeps editors honest); assuming good faith and being courteous; refraining from taking sides and being radically transparent. It’s a no-nonsense “lessons learned” book that might otherwise find itself occupying shelf space next to Steven Bartlett’s Diary of a CEO (subtitle: The 33 Laws of Business and Life) – but Wikipedia’s ubiquity, and the way it has dramatically bucked the trend of online toxicity – make it potentially far more significant.I just like doing interesting things. So I get up and I do the most interesting thing I can think of. And Wikipedia is super interesting …I meet Wales at his publishers’ offices near the British Museum in London. It’s a clear autumn morning and we sit in the Duncan Grant-inspired “author’s room” amid brightly coloured cushions and murals. He wears a creased pink linen shirt and slurps coffee while we wait for pastries. It’s the second time we’ve met – the first was at a dinner in July to give journalists a taste of the book, where he showed himself able to hold forth in front of a room of literary editors and reporters in press conference mode. Here he seems a bit more hesitant, chuckling nervously, prone to delivering answers with great big bracketed sections that make us both forget what the question was.“I’m a little bit too shy to do interviews, even though I do,” he tells me, about the process of talking to people about Seven Rules. Traces of his native Alabama have mostly disappeared from his accent after years of living in London, and there’s even the occasional English glottal stop. He moved here in 2012 to be with Kate Garvey, a former aide to Tony Blair, whom he met at the World Economic Forum in Davos. They are married and have two daughters together. “It’s a funny thing when I say that I’m shy to people, because they’re like, ‘Oh, you do a lot of public speaking’, but yeah, that’s not the same thing.” You wouldn’t call him socially awkward, exactly, but neither does he present as completely Ted Talk ready. Instead, he’s ordinary, approachable, with none of the bombast of some of his internet mogul peers.Wales turns 60 next year. His direct contemporaries include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. All of them have had profound influence on our lives, but only one of them has failed to become a billionaire.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pål Hansen/The GuardianThere’s an easy story to tell about this; that as “the good guy of the internet” Wales used his entrepreneurial skills in the service of a higher calling. What does he make of that kind of talk? “I don’t know. I mean, it’s embarrassing,” he laughs. Is there a part of him that likes the epithet, though? “Of course, no, it’s great. I mean, I’m very proud of Wikipedia.” But the idea that he renounced astronomical amounts of money in order to make the world a better place is wide of the mark. “I don’t see it like that. Early in my career, in the career of Wikipedia, a lot of journalists were asking that question, thinking I was going to be some kind of communist because, like, why would you be doing this thing as a nonprofit? But I’m not. I’m actually quite in favour of business and capitalism and all that.” (He’s currently president of Fandom, an ad-funded entertainment site that hosts user-edited pages, owned by private equity firm TPG Capital). “I just like doing interesting things. So I get up and I just do the most interesting thing I can think of. And Wikipedia is super interesting … I go and I visit with Wikipedians all around the world and go to schools and things like that. I meet prime ministers.”“And actually, on the money front,” he continues, “I live here in London. How many bankers in the City make far more money than I ever will? Loads of them. How many of their lives are dramatically less interesting than mine? I would say almost all of them.”Back in 2006, comedian Stephen Colbert did a bit about Wikipedia, saying it was the harbinger of a distortedform of reality called “Wikiality”(“if enough other users agree … it becomes true”), and encouraging viewers of The Colbert Report to introduce edits containing bogus stats about elephants. It almost collapsed the site. Fast forward to 2025 and it seems that Wikipedia might be the antidote to “alternative facts”, with lessons not just for the web, but for society more broadly.Not everyone is convinced. On the day I meet Wales, Musk suggests to his 228 million followers on X that “Wikipedia should be called Wokipedia (or Dickipedia 😂)”. It’s the latest salvo in Musk’s rolling campaign to discredit the nonprofit site and generate interest in his own “Grokipedia” project, a plan for an AI-based encyclopedia that will be “a massive improvement over Wikipedia” and “a necessary step towards the xAI goal of understanding the universe”.Musk’s hostility aside, does Wales see artificial intelligence in general as a threat? If people are increasingly relying on AI summaries, might Wikipedia’s dominance turn out to have been a blip? “I don’t think so,” he says, “but, I mean, that’s obviously on a lot of people’s minds these days.” It would be ironic, given that the site’s free licensing model means it can be used by anyone for anything – including as training data for large language models. “There are definitely threats to the web, but they’re not necessarily coming from AI,” he says. “I think the bigger threat is the rise of authoritarianism, governments, regulations, which make it harder to have a truly open global web where people are free to share ideas.” It’s true that Wikipedia is blocked in China, and faces sporadic censorship in Russia and elsewhere. Wales’s stance on this is not to give an inch –he has said: “We have a very firm policy, never breached, to never cooperate with government censorship in any region of the world.”Elon and I have been friendly. Even now, he’s much nicer to me in private than you might thinkWhat about his billionaire peers? Do they have any influence? Musk messaged him the morning after the 2024 US presidential election, not to crow over Donald Trump’s victory, but to complain about a Wikipedia article in which a friend of his was described as “far right”. When Wales checked, it had already been changed, and he judged that it was a reasonable call, though he won’t tell me whose page it was. “I mean, the circumstances were a little surprising, but it’s, you know, completely legitimate.” He says people are always messaging him saying they’ve seen something on a page that doesn’t look right. Wales will take a look, but he doesn’t hand out favours: changes have to conform to the usual rules about fairness and proper sourcing.Does he still regard Musk, the world’s richest man, as a friend? “Friends is probably a little strong. I mean, not, not that –” he sputters, editing himself in real time. “I want to be careful how I say that, only because I’ve met him maybe five or six times, so that I would be overstating to say friends. We’ve been friendly, and even now he’s much nicer to me in private than you might think. I mean, he’s got a big public persona, and that’s a little bit different from the private Elon, who I think is more thoughtful.” It’s a weird strategy, isn’t it, to be so aggressive in public, if that’s not what you’re actually like? “I don’t know. It’s a good question. I have this general rule of, like, I can’t speculate about what goes on in Elon Musk’s head. I have no idea – I’m as at a loss as anybody.”Musk’s attacks are rooted in a belief that Wikipedia has an in-built leftwing bias. In this, he joins the likes ofTucker Carlson, who recently said: “It’s an emergency, in my opinion, that Wikipedia is completely dishonest.” There’s a sense that Maga has Wikipedia in its sights.Wales is frustrated by this, but isn’t going to get drawn into a slanging match. “It’s annoying, but one of the things that I’ve said to [Musk] is if you really want to help, the right way is not to misstate the facts,” he says firmly. “Saying that Wikipedia has been taken over by ‘woke’ activists is just false. But if you think Wikipedia has some bias in it – and, of course, that’s always something we have to think about and grapple with – then going around saying it has been taken over by ‘crazed trans Hamas supporters’, or whatever you think, is doing two things. One, it’s telling kind and thoughtful conservatives that Wikipedia is not the place for you, and that’s a shame. And it’s also telling [activists], here’s your new home, which means we have to deal with them. We want to communicate to everybody that Wikipedia is not a very comfortable place for extremists. If you want to rant about things and you want to be super biased, then go on, write your own blog. What we’re looking for is kind and thoughtful people who care more about getting it right and being calm and factual.”Seven Rules is particularly strong on the importance of not taking sides, arguing that if people believe an institution isn’t neutral, trust evaporates. Crucially, that happens even if it’s biased in your favour. Wales citeswork by Cory Clarkat the University of Pennsylvania that looked at how people responded to political stands taken by all sorts of organisations, from newspapers to dental clinics to sports leagues. “When people thought a group was politicised against their own political position, they trusted the group less. No surprise there. But when people thought the group had taken sides and was politically aligned with them … they still trusted them less.”He brings up his own example: “I remember during the first Trump administration reading a hard news story in the Washington Post, which was doing great reporting, and I loved this story. But at the end, I’m like: ‘That was a rant against Donald Trump, and they interpreted every piece of evidence in the most negative possible way.’” This annoyed him even though he was on the “side” of the reporter (earlier, Wales tells me: “I really can’t bear Donald Trump, he’s just appalling.”). “Do I feel like I’ve gotten the full picture to make up my own mind, or do I feel like I’ve been fed something that I probably already agree with? I think that’s problematic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And that’s my happy place.’ Wales in 2005 in his office in St Petersburg, Florida.Photograph: Gary Bogdon/The New York Times/eyevineAt the same time, neutrality and civility has its limits, doesn’t it? I mention a clever op-ed by Larry David that made this point, calledMy Dinner With Adolf, in which the comedian imagines breaking bread with the worst man in history. He ends with the line: “I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came. Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn’t mean that we have to hate each other.” What does Wales think about the risk that, in giving a fair hearing to all sides, you can fail in the moral duty to call out real wickedness?“So I think we can make a distinction here between what I ought to do, what you ought to do, versus what anencyclopediaought to do,” he says. “Hitler is always a terrible example, but it actually is a great example in this case: it’s like, the Hitler entry doesn’t have to be a rant against Hitler. You just write down what he did, and it’s a damning indictment right there … you don’t need to add ‘PS, he’s a horrible person’. You just say: ‘These are the facts, draw your own conclusions.’” In Seven Rules, he quotes a Ukrainian Wikipedia editor who puts his personal feeling to one side to maintain the policy of strict neutrality: “The neutral facts are still on the side of Ukraine, right?”I’m not gonna go into space with my rocket. I like it here on Earth. There’s oxygenThis separation of fact and sentiment seems pretty unusual nowadays. It’s no great mystery why: in the book, Wales talks about “an entire class of ‘content creators’ who have effectively been trained by social media algorithms to play up outrage, fear, and hate at every opportunity”. Part of the reason this has happened is because of the lack of guiding principles among web 2.0’s major players. “Unlike Wikipedia, social media platforms have no purpose beyond selling eyeballs to advertisers, so there was nothing steering the development of norms toward civility and constructive conversation,” he writes.Is that inevitable, given the profit motive? Or, to put it another way: did money make the web go bad, spawning everything from democracy-destroying deepfakes to AI slop? No, says Wales. For him, the real poison is a lack of ethics. And that’s the result of poor commercial instincts, rather than commerce itself. “I’ve said this to people at Facebook: if the public becomes convinced that you’re destroying western civilisation, you’ve got a big business problem. And I think that’s proving to be true, as they’re in decline.” Other than that, he’s a “pathological optimist” and still feels pretty good about the internet in general. “Google search, the internet as a whole – like, it’s amazing, you know? So we can sometimes get a little jaded and forget that, and just say: Oh, people are being really mean on Twitter. Yeah, that’s true. So my recommendation is just don’t go to Twitter any more.”Wales enjoyed a modest but comfortable childhood in Huntsville, Alabama, the son of a grocery store manager and a schoolteacher. He spent “countless hours” reading The World Book Encyclopedia his mother had bought from a door-to-door salesman, eagerly awaiting the updates that arrived by post once a year. When he became a trader in Chicago in the 90s, he “loved it” because “it was very mathematical”. He maintains he doesn’t really envy the digital tycoons whose fortunes have far eclipsed his own. “I’m just a geek. I literally work every day in an office in my basement, right? And that’s my happy place. I’ve got my two computers, and I’ve got my treadmill. I’m not gonna go into space with my rocket. I like it here on Earth. There’s oxygen.”And while Wikipedia isn’t Wales’s cash cow, it still needs to make money. Regular users will be familiar with banners (sometimes emblazoned with Wales’s face) soliciting funds. Where do all those donations go? “Our finances are super transparent, so you can just go and look. They go to programmers, bandwidth, hardware, the tech side of things. There’s accounting, finance, legal, PR, and then we make grants.”In late 2024, using the slogan “Stop donating to Wokepedia”, various rightwing accounts (including Musk’s) shared graphs purporting to show that Wikipedia’s parent foundation spent “$50m of their total $177m budget on diversity, equity, and inclusion”. Were they referring to some of that grant money? He starts his answer with the weary “Yeahhh” of someone who’s had to patiently explain a position many times, before setting out what he sees as the bigger picture: “For a lot of people and a lot of companies, DEI is, sadly, just a tack-on, right? It’s like, ‘Oh, we need to do this thing to not look horrible’, and that’s unfortunate … for us, Wikipedia is completely global. It’s a free encyclopedia for every single person on the planet in their own language. So diversity, equity and inclusion are fundamental to the mission. We actually care about people who are native speakers of Swahili being active in Wikipedia, because that’s our goal: an encyclopedia for everyone. It isn’t ‘woke nonsense’. It is all about the mission.“The grants were basically outreach to groups to say: can we bring in more women editors? Can we bring in more African American editors, people who have different knowledge bases? It was 100% all related to improving Wikipedia.” He sees the criticisms as “completely invalid” and again makes the point that the online right’s scorched-earth approach to its perceived enemies makes addressing any real issues all the more difficult. “You know, I think there’s a legitimate question – we should ask ourselves this for every grant we make. Does it work? Should we do more funding like this, or less funding like this? One of the things that I always encourage in my role on the board is pilot projects, and being experimental.” He worries that this important culture of trial and error is under threat. “Throughout the whole NGO sector, throughout corporate funding of things, there’s a chilling effect going on, where work that would be perfectly sensible and valid, companies are shying away from it because they don’t want to be tarred as ‘go woke, go broke’.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Pål Hansen/The GuardianIn some ways, Wikipedia has been the canary in the coalmine for many of today’s hot-button issues – rows over diversity, the use of language, concerns about anonymity, trolling and misinformation. During the pandemic, when quackery and conspiracism were rife, a group of editors made it their mission to police medical misinformation on the site. Crucially, they tried to maintain everyone’s trust while doing so, citing evidence and recording every twist and turn of the debate in the editors’ “talk” pages, which are preserved for ever. At the time,Wales said: “I think a lot of organisations can help with misinformation by simply being more transparent, more open … Just saying, ‘Well, I’m a reporter from the BBC, and I’m telling you this’, that isn’t enough to prove it to people any more … you actually have to show your work, you have to explain how you came to some conclusion.” I wonder if British politics could benefit from a similar approach. It’s an area where Wales has more than a few connections – in the run-up to the 2015 election, he was in talks to advise Ed Miliband on digital strategy; Garvey’s connections meant that Tony and Cherie Blair attended their wedding, where Alastair Campbell played the bagpipes; Alexis Kirschbaum, the editorial director who shepherded Seven Rules through to publication, is married to former culture secretary James Purnell.“For a government that actually has a massive majority,” he says of Keir Starmer’s administration, “they seem very timid and lacking in pursuing bigger ideas, and I think that is part of the problem … I would rather see them taking some bold actions that I disagree with than just sort of dithering around and not getting anything done. Be more clear about what it is that you are going to accomplish, and then actually do it.”It’s tempting to ask what the nerd in the basement is doing offering advice to an elected government. But the improbability of what he’s achieved – an information-sharing platform based on cooperation in an era of profound polarisation – may mean that he’s worth listening to. Does he feel as if he’s in “legacy mode” now, passing on what he’s learned to the world? “I mean, in part yes, in part hopefully no. I remember there was a Wired magazine story probably 15 years ago that said something like: ‘He doesn’t need to do anything else.’ Well, hold on! I’m still very active.” Is it annoying to always be “the Wikipedia guy”? “It’s not a bad guy to be, so it’s OK,” he chuckles. “In 100 years’ time, when people look back on this era, they’re going to look at the Wikipedia community and say, ‘Well, that was actually quite a crazy time, and there was a little oasis of nice people doing something good.’”And then there’s family – his daughters Ada and Jemima, with Garvey, and, of course, Kira. How is she doing, a quarter of a century later? “Kira is fantastic. She’s turned out great. She’s into airplanes. She came to visit, and I got her a pilot lesson, you know, just a trial lesson, for fun. She loved it.” And she never says: ‘Dad, why didn’t you monetise your massive website?’ “No, no, no,” he laughs. “She’s like me. She’s a super geek.”The Seven Rules of Trust: Why It Is Today’s Most Essential Superpower is published by Bloomsbury on 28 October (£22).

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The Ultra 3 is Apple’s answer to adventure watches such asGarmin’s Fenix 8 Prowhile being a full smartwatch for the iPhone with all the trimmings. As such, it is not cheap, costing from £749 (€899/$799/A$1,399) – £50 less than2023’s model– sitting above the £369-plusSeries 11and £219 Watch SE 3.From the outside it doesn’t look like a lot has changed for the Ultra 3 over itstwo-year-old predecessor. Available in natural or black titanium, it is exactly the same size but squeezes in a slightly bigger screen with smaller bezels making it the largest on an Apple Watch.The display is much brighter when viewed at an angle, which makes seeing it at a glance a lot easier, and now shows ticking seconds when idle like theSeries 10and 11. It is very bright, covered by super-hard sapphire glass and has one of the very best screens on a watch.View image in fullscreenThe chunky crown and armoured side button help prevent accidental presses during workouts while still making them easy to use with gloves.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ultra 3 has the same S10 chip asthe Series 11and the same excellent touch-free gestures. Double tap your thumb and index finger to press buttons or scroll, or flick your wrist quickly away from you and back to dismiss alarms, notifications or return to the watch face.Apple has managed to fit a 6% larger battery into the Ultra 3, which lasts a good three-plus days between charges with general usage and sleep tracking over night. Most people will need to put it on the charger every third night, which is a good day longer than any other Apple Watch, although some way behind the week-long battery of adventure watchrivals from Garminand others.The watch fully charges in about two hours, hitting 50% in 30 minutes via the included USB-C magnetic charging puck.Satellite and 5GThe watch supports 5G, if you have a compatible phone plan, and has noticeably stronger cellular reception in weaker signal areas for 4G. Apple has also brought its free satellite SOS messagingfrom the iPhoneto the Ultra 3, which allows you to contact the emergency services via text using satellites when out of cellular signal range. Satellites can also be used for Find My location tracking and messages to friends and loved ones, although the latter is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico, and both need a compatible cellular data plan.The Ultra 3 runs the same recentwatchOS 26 softwareas the Series 11 and other Apple Watches, which introduced a revamped design and some new watch faces. In addition, the Ultra 3 has an attractive new Waypoint watch face, which has a live compass that shows points of interest around you. It joins a few other information-dense Ultra-exclusive faces, including the Wayfinder and Modular Ultra.View image in fullscreenA selection of faces for the Ultra 3, including the new Exactograph (top left), Waypoint (top middle) and Flux (top right) and a shot of the always-on display off angle.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianSpecificationsCase size:49 x 44mmCase thickness:12mmWeight:61.8gProcessor:S10Storage:64GBOperating system:watchOS 26Water resistance:100 metres (10ATM)Sensors:HR, ECG, spO2, temp, depth, dual-band GPS, compass, altimeterConnectivity:Bluetooth 5.3, wifi n, NFC, UWB, satellite, optional 5G/eSIMTop-notch sport and health trackingView image in fullscreenThe domed sapphire glass sensor cluster on the back records most of the health metrics, sitting comfortably on the wrist.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe Ultra supports the same comprehensive health and fitness-tracking capabilities as thestandard Apple Watch. That includes a wealth of heart health monitoring, such as ECG, abnormal rhythm notifications, blood oxygen tracking, and new hypertension alerts that analyse 30-days of readings for signs of high blood pressure.It has Apple’s new sleep score metric, which makes it easier to understand your tracked sleep, plus wrist temperature monitoring, cycle tracking with ovulation estimation and many other tools.The Ultra builds on the workout tracking of the standard Apple Watch in a couple of ways. The extra action button in the side can be used to quickly start a workout, but unlike Apple’s other watches you can wait until you have a GPS lock before starting the exercise by pressing it again.View image in fullscreenThe precision start feature is exclusive to the Ultra, but should be on the standard Apple Watch, too.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianThe best bit is a dual-band GPS system that boosts tracking accuracy in tricky environments, such as dense urban areas with tall buildings or in woods. It’s a feature found onthe top running watchesand has been improved since theinitial Ultrato become one of the most accurate on the market, matching or beating the very best in urban GPS stress tests.It also tracks a good number of metrics including the usual distance, pace and cadence, plus running power and dynamics, training load and heart rate zones. It can be loaded with structured workouts such as intervals, and it has a very good track detection mode for doing laps. The Ultra has similarly good cycling, swimming and triathlon profiles, plus diving to 40-metre depths and at least 22 other activities.View image in fullscreenThe bright orange action button can be customised to trigger different features, including workouts, a torch, stopwatch, voice memos or other actions.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianCombined with the large and bright screen, and the decent 11 to 14-hour battery life when tracking running at its highest accuracy levels, the Ultra 3 makes for a surprisingly good sports watch.The Ultra also supports Apple’s newWorkout Buddy AI coach, which works with walks, runs, hikes, cycling and various other training workouts, giving you pep-talks before, during and after activities via Bluetooth headphones. But it requires you to carry an iPhone 15 Pro or later for it to work, which is a drag.SustainabilityApple says the battery should last more than1,000 full charge cycleswith at least 80% of its original capacity and can be replaced for£95. Damage repairs cost£489.The watch contains more than 40% recycled material, including cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, rare earth elements, steel, titanium and tungsten. Apple offers trade-in and free recycling for devices, and breaks down the watch’s environmental impactin its report.PriceThe Apple Watch Ultra 3 comes in a choice of two colours and multiple bands costing from£749(€899/$799/A$1,399).VerdictThe Ultra 3 is the biggest, baddest and best Apple Watch the company makes but it isn’t a massive leap over previous models.Other than satellite SOS messaging, which could genuinely save your life in an emergency, the rest of the watch is simply a refinement of the Ultra 2.But the added battery life is very welcome, so is a bigger and fancier screen in the same size watch. New software features are great and the wrist-flick gesture for dismissing things is the best thing added to any Apple Watch in recent memory.The Ultra is still a rarer sight than other models, so if you wanted a less ubiquitous Apple Watch this is it. While those looking for a dedicated top-priced sports watch might overlook it in favour of a Garmin or similar, the Ultra 3 has all the ingredients to be a first-rate training companion – as long as you can charge it more frequently – while still being the best smartwatch you can get with an iPhone.The Ultra 3 is the best Apple Watch. Just don’t expect it to be a massive upgrade over older Ultra models.Pros:fantastic screen, rugged yet sophisticated design, double-tap and wrist-flick gestures, three-day battery life, 5G and satellite SOS/messaging, top health tracking, great activity tracking with dual-band GPS, extra action button, 100-metre water resistance and 40-metre dive-ready, long software support.Cons:very expensive, only works with an iPhone, no third-party watch faces, no big upgrade on previous Ultra models, shorter battery life than adventure watch rivals.View image in fullscreenThe Ultra 3 is a big Apple Watch, but fairly compact and easy to slip under cuffs compared with the adventure watch competition.Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The GuardianExplore more on these topicsApple WatchAppleWearable technologyGadgetsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In other words, there is no tangible difference when it comes to how sharp an image appears to our eyes.“At a certain viewing distance, it doesn’t matter how many pixels you add. It’s just, I suppose, wasteful because your eye can’t really detect it,” said Dr Maliha Ashraf, the first author of the study from the University of Cambridge.Ashraf and colleagues, writing in the journal Nature Communications, report how they set about determining the resolution limit of the human eye, noting that while 20/20 vision implies the eye can distinguish 60 pixels per degree (PPD), most people with normal or corrected vision can see better than that.The ‘remarkable’ implant that can restore sight – podcastRead more“If you design or judge display resolution based only on 20/20 vision, you’ll underestimate what people can really see,” Ashraf said. “That’s why we directly measured how many pixels people can actually distinguish.”The team used a 27in, 4K monitor mounted on a mobile cage that enabled it to be moved towards or away from the viewer. At each distance, 18 participants with normal vision, or vision corrected to be normal, were shown two types of image in a random order. One type of image had one-pixel-wide vertical lines in black and white, red and green or yellow and violet, while the other was just a plain grey block. Participants were then asked to indicate which of the two images contained the lines.“When the lines become too fine or the screen resolution too high, the pattern looks no different from a plain grey image,” Ashraf said. “We measured the point where people could just barely tell them apart. That’s what we call the resolution limit.”The researchers found the human eye can resolve more detail than commonly thought, revealing the average was 94 PPD for greyscale images viewed straight on, while for red and green patterns it was 89 PPD. For yellow and violet patterns it was lower, at 53 PPD.In another experiment, 12 of the participants were presented with white text on a black background and vice versa, again at various distances, and were asked to indicate when the text looked as sharp as a sharp reference version.“The resolution at which people stopped noticing differences in text matched what we saw with the line patterns,” Ashraf said.The researchers have released a chart that shows different screen sizes and viewing distances, along with the nearest standard resolution that reaches or slightly exceeds the visual limit for most people.“In other words, if your setup falls into one of those squares, you wouldn’t gain any visible benefit from going higher,” Ashraf said.The team have also created afree online calculatorthat allows users to enter their viewing distance along with the size and resolution of their screen, with the results indicating whether the setup is above or below the resolution limit of the human eye. As a result, users can explore whether a higher-resolution screen with more pixels would make a difference to what they see.“If someone already has a 4K, 44-inch TV and watches it from about 2.5 metres away, that’s already more detail than the eye can see,” Ashraf said. “Upgrading to an 8K version of the same size wouldn’t look any sharper.”Explore more on these topicsTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Séance of Blake Manor sounds like the stuff of cosy Sunday evening entertainment. Thankfully, this folk-horror drama has much more to offer than a bit of fun for Agatha Christie fans.It’s October 1897, and you play as private investigator Declan Ward, sent to the aforementioned manor – now a grand hotel – to discover the whereabouts of one of its guests, Evelyn Deane, who has gone missing in mysterious circumstances. What you discover is a gothic mansion filled with eccentrics: from a psychic researcher wielding a spirit camera to a vodouist oungan and a Brazilian woman tracing her family roots. They are here to attend a grand seance that will take place on All Hallow’s Eve, when the phantasmagoric barrier between the worlds of the living and the dead is at its thinnest. But as you discover while you wander the ornate rooms and meticulously planned gardens via first-person viewpoint, each participant has a secret – some deadly, some tragic – and many know more about young Miss Deane than they’re letting on.View image in fullscreenAbsolutely gripping … The Séance of Blake Manor.Photograph: Spooky Doorway/Raw FuryWhat follows is, in some ways, an archetypal detective adventure, told in the visual style of a graphic novel, the art heavily inspired by the works of Mike Mignola (Hellboy) and Eduardo Risso (100 Bullets). You talk to suspects and witnesses, explore rooms for hidden clues and useful items, and slowly draw up a list of culprits. All the while, the game has an internal clock and a timetable of events that your investigations must fit into. The clock only ticks forward if you’re actively searching a location or interrogating a guest, so you must make efficient use of your detective skills, and you always need to make sure you’re in the right place at the right time to eavesdrop on clandestine meetings, or to catch useful talks on spiritualism, mythology and the history of the manor that take place in the grand drawing room.All your findings can be examined and connected via a series of graphical inventory screens, which include an evolving mind map of clues and actions. It can be overwhelming to begin with, all these systems suddenly booting into life with every letter, key and clue you discover, but you gradually get the hang of things and realise that making your own notes is a must. While it’s not as structurally innovative asBlue Prince, the game has interesting ways of prompting you in certain directions, including a word game deduction system that gets you to create hypotheses of motives and backstories with which to confront suspects.As your investigation unfolds, you begin to understand that this isn’t simply a cosy little period adventure. It is a game with a point to make. The mansion has been built on top of a site of ancient historical and religious importance, transforming it into a colonialist symbol, while the wealth of the visitors is contrasted with the poverty of the hotel’s staff in subtle and meaningful ways. This is a game about appropriation and sociocultural destruction as much as it is about one character disappearing, and as we learn about folklore and paganism, we also come to understand what the manor and its rich owners – the troubled Blake family – really represent. Woven into this is the theme of diaspora, with several guests arriving from colonised countries, seeking the answers to complex family mysteries. Here too are tales of drug addiction, abuse and grief, all carefully woven into the central narrative. There are also some genuinely spine-tingling moments as apparitions appear at the edges of your vision and things go bump in the night.The result is an absolutely gripping detective tale and a beautifully researched work of interactive folk horror to stand alongside the recent Strange Antiquities and Wadjet Eye’s seminal The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow. It completely immerses you in its world of clashing cultures and supernatural revenge, managing to explore complex themes of colonial trauma, religion and identity within the confines of a single location and event. It will have you rushing to the bookshop or library to read more about spiritualism, folklore and ancient Irish history.Sure, The Séance of Blake Manor is an autumnal treat filled with spooky scenes but it is also that most joyous of discoveries: a game that challenges, delights, thrills and educates in equal measure.The Séance of Blake Manor is out now, £16.75Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

The then US ambassador, Spruille Braden, had other ideas about who should win the national election that year, and he openly campaigned against Perón in Buenos Aires. Braden’s action stands out as one of the most brazen instances of US interference in Argentina’s politics.Until now.The Argentine president, Javier Milei, whowon a resounding midterm victoryon Sunday, has received ample support from Donald Trump. Ahead of the congressional elections, Trump endorsed Milei and warned: “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.” Washington extended a$20bn currency swap lineto the government – money aimed at stabilising financial volatility that would have undermined Milei’s chances. The US treasury even intervened directly, buying more than abillion dollarsof pesos to slow the currency’s freefall in recent weeks.Trump’s bailout of Argentina is not an act of economic prudence (economists across the spectrum sayit makes no sense), but of ideological finance. The goal is to shore up an ally in the US’s back yard and discredit opponents, especially the leftwing Perónist tendency in Argentinian politics that Trumpequates with his own domestic opponents. Historically, Washington dressed up these types of ideological interventions as serving the greater good, defined in terms of US interests. But Trump has dispensed with even that pretence. For him, foreign policy is not strategic: it’s anchored by personal loyalties.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brazil’s government has weatheredpunitive sanctionsagainst officials in retaliation for prosecuting the former president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who attempted a coup. The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, has beenpersonally sanctioned by Scott Bessent’s treasury department. Venezuela faces lethal US strikes on vessels off its coast. The disciplinary message to the region is clear: Washington will use its financial and military power to reward obedience and punish dissent.For Argentina, this kind of interference has a long pedigree. Braden’s crusade against Juan Perón was also driven by ideological paranoia. Yet the approach failed. Perón’s supporters rallied under the slogan “Braden o Perón”, painting the fight as a stark choice between foreign interference and national sovereignty. Perón won, and his political legacy hasdefined Argentine politicsever since. He later quipped that if Braden had not existed, “we would have had to invent him”.Perón’s voters 80 years ago weren’t just motivated by the symbolism of US interference. They voted to reject a political status quo that was deaf to their needs. Likewise, for an electorate exhausted by years of economic and social crises, Milei and Trump’s campaign succeeded by focusing voters’ energies on the failures of the old political establishment.Do populists always crash the economy?Read moreStill, Milei’s voters had numerous motivations. “A significant portion of Milei’s vote, I would say a little over half of what he obtained, is an electorate that is still hopeful and confident about the future,” says Shila Vilker, director of Argentine pollster firm Trespuntozero. Another significant chunk were concerned that US financial assistance would be conditional on the election’s results. Some were scared of the unknown, others wanted to reject Perónism.Having won the election, Milei’s challenge will now be to manage monetary policy. The government had been burning through reserves to maintain the peso’s value. US assistance was explicitly a stopgap.A temporary influx of dollars will not rescue a programme that is failing its own electorate – and in the longer term, Argentine voters are unlikely to be swayed by foreign patronage.Trump’s attempts to weaponise foreign policy in the region have often misfired. In Brazil, his assault on democratic institutions helped to bolster the popularity of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. In Panama, the government’s deference to American demands overChina’s access to the canalhas sparked domestic anger. For now, Milei has bucked this trend. He has secured a minority in congress that shields his austerity agenda from legislative vetoes. His symbolic victory was also enormous: he won by a single point in Buenos Aires province,a bastion of Perónism.That Milei’s libertarian experiment already needs rescuing underscores its failure. Inflation has eased, but austerity haschoked growth and gutted subsidiesfor transport, energy, health and education, making it harder for the country’s poor to make it to the end of the month. Wages are6% lessin real terms than they were just before Milei took office, and aBig Mac costs morein Argentina than in New York. Confidence in the government has plummeted, and belief in a “better future” hasfallen from 48% to 34% in 2025.Trump’s foreign policy is ideological, but it’s also markedly volatile. On Sunday he met with his ideological enemy Lula da Silva, who, despite US tariffs and sanctions, has spiritedly refused to compromise on the prosecution of the former president, Jair Bolsonaro. After months of acrimony, Lula and Trump are now reportedly working to reach a trade agreement. For all Trump’s bluster about friendship, his interventions lay bare a truth that Latin America has long understood: Washington’s priorities seldom align with the needs of those who live with their consequences.Jordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires; she edits the Latin America Daily BriefingDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Bring on the frog costumes and naked cyclistsMon 27 Oct 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 11.33 EDTShareWhen Donald Trump declared Portland, Oregon, “a hellhole” overtaken by “the Radical Left’s reign of terror”, Portlanders took to the streets not as an angry mob, but as frogs. They showed up in inflatable costumes by the dozens. Clowns came out dancing. Naked cyclists rode among unicycles, chiming bike bells and honking rubber horns. A band of gray-haired banjo players incited not a riot but a folk-song singalong. It seemed that the more absurd the accusation, the sillier the response.As the attacks on democracy and mischaracterizations of millions of Americans become more extreme, the reasons for outrage grow. Reading the news is infuriating. But while anger can temporarily mobilize us, it is exhausting and disempowering in the long term. Constant rage doesn’t feel good to most of us. As we buckle into this new normal of uncertainty, I’m glad to see we’re showing up with creativity, humor, music, all tools that are central to who we are and how we cope. The administration’s performance of power and control are being met not with protest: but with play.In childhood we play to become who we are, and in adulthood we play to express and sustain who we are. To be playful in this moment in history is not to take it lightly. In fact, the seriousness of this time requires a resilience learned and practiced in play. I’m not proposing we pause the work of defending our rights to play as a kind of self-care, or that joy is in and of itself a kind of resistance. I’m proposing that a playful mindset will make us more agile amid the unknowns, and resilient through adversity. Through play we actively cultivate the skills we need to persevere through uncertainty.Uncertainty is not something we’re going to fix. Kristalina Georgieva, head of the IMF, said last week: “Buckle up: uncertainty is the new normal.” Comfort with uncertainty can be learned in free play – an activity that is freely chosen, personally directed and intrinsically motivated. This is the type of play I advocate for in my work as a toy and playground designer. In the two decades that I’ve been at it, countless adults have asked for my help in reconnecting with their playful nature. Grownups need play too, especially now. A playful mindset helps us release judgment, embrace possibility and reframe success. Plus it feels good. All of these can be strategies to cope with the unfamiliar place the world finds itself in.As a queer person of indeterminate gender, I’ve had no shortage of reasons to be outraged. I’ve been denied equal rights, discriminated against, and physically assaulted for who I am, which is reflected in how I look. Like many with similar stories, I persist. We find each other on dancefloors and parties, as marginalized people have done for millennia. Queer people have always used play as protest. The Stonewall Uprising was a reaction to oppression; we mark the occasion with a parade. To honor our elders and peers – their struggle and pain, their joy and love – we play. We gather, we dance, we dress up, we mourn and celebrate. Our play is how we both experience our resilience and express it. It’s how we reject mischaracterizations that seek to shame and silence us. Play is how we resist. I’ve carried this deep certainty of play’s essential value into my work as a designer and educator. By helping people – both children and adults – access the richness of free play, I know that I am also giving them a tool to express freedom.Last weekend, I joined millions who took to the streets forNo Kings rallies. Many of us, whether inspired by the response modeled in Portland or led by our own instincts, showed up playfully. Participants were encouraged to wear yellow, a tall order for New Yorkers, known for wearing black. Among the sea of odd and creative combinations of yellow dress, I saw inflatable animals of various species, papier-mache caricatures, Muppet costumes and superheroes. There was a band playing Yankee Doodle with kitchen utensils. There were aliens offering to take us to their leader and drag queens with “No Kings” sashes.I strapped a vintage toy to my head because it seemed like the right thing to do, and walked with a brigade of clowns. I asked them, “Why clown today?” and heard the following:“Clowning is how I access childlike wonder, joy and positivity.”“The nose is how I reject the dehumanizing things going on, and invite others to join me.”And my favorite – “It’s what I had.” She may have meant “This is the costume I had”, but I took it to mean, “This is the tool I have on hand.”Boycotts, strikes and more protests: organizers on what’s next for No KingsRead moreAs we inched past Penn Station, the clowns reminded me of the importance of being playful for those who need positivity and wonder, but who can’t access it in the midst of trauma or duress. I’ve met clowns who work in refugee camps and hospitals; some are volunteers and some work for the government in countries who fund such things. At this rally in midtown Manhattan, the clowns were met with elation and glee. I heard “thank you” more than a few times.One particular moment at No Kings will stick with me. Peppered among the protest signs, which ranged from denunciations of ICE to “You know it’s bad if New Yorkers are walking this slowly”, I noticed a group handing out bold-lettered badges that read simply, “NOT OK”. It’s true, we are not OK. Our neighbors are forcefully disappeared from the streets, our cities are threatened with martial law, our bodily autonomy is under direct attack, and any legal recourse is risky and hobbled. For those of us who oppose the program of this administration, every day comes with a flood of overwhelming and despairing news. Yet here we were in the middle of 7th Ave, basking in the warmth of sunlight and strangers, as a clown offered their own red nose in exchange for another demonstrator’s NOT OK badge. Both protesters laughed and added each other’s precious gifts to their costumes.

It faces two key critiquesMon 27 Oct 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 13.46 EDTShareWhat, exactly, isCongressfor? In the secondTrump administration, it can be hard to tell. The power to declare war, long considered a crucial legislative power, has become a murky prerogative of the executive branch in the years since September 11; Trump, in recent months, has claimed even more of that power for himself, conducting strikes onvessels in the Caribbean.The power of the purse seems to have largely been stripped from Congress, too; now, under the office of management and budget director, Russell Vought, much of the power to appropriate federal funds has also defaulted to the presidency, with theWhite House claiming the abilityto abort congressionally authorized expenditures and seeking toredirect the money elsewhere. It’s not like they’re passing any laws, either; virtually all legislation must now be crammed into budget reconciliation bills, massive perennial must-spend omnibus legislation that can circumvent the filibuster. But when those don’t pass – and increasingly, they don’t – the government simply shuts down. At least, that is, big parts of the government do – and it’s not clear how many people notice. Currently, the government has been shut down all month; there are no signs of it reopening anytime soon. But the executive branch keeps on humming along.And so the question of control of Congress can seem somewhat moot. Why should Americans care who holds a majority in a body that has largely abolished itself?How ‘screw Trump’ messaging may help California’s Proposition 50 prevailRead moreAnd yet Proposition 50, California’s redistricting referendum that could deliver five additional House seats to the Democrats if it is embraced by voters in a special election next month, has captured the political imagination of liberals across the country. In part, it is a belated response to trends happening elsewhere: Republican-controlled states have long embraced dramatic partisan gerrymandering while large Democratic-controlled states such as California, New York and Washington draw their maps via non-partisan independentcommissions, an asymmetry that has led to closely divided House control and a longstanding sense, by Democrats, that their party is bringing a knife to a gun fight. The California measure is explicitly intended as a countermove to a mid-decade redistricting that recently passed in Texas, which installed maps that will give Republicans an additional five seats in the state’s congressional delegation next year; similar redistricting moves are under way in states such asMissouriandIndiana. (Democrats in Virginiaare also following California’s lead in seeking to redistrict.)TheCaliforniameasure seems likely to pass, as Democratic and liberal voters respond with fear and anger to Trump’s authoritarian consolidation of power and look for ways to check his worst impulses. But Prop 50 is not without controversy. Some critics warn that the move could backfire, with Democratic-controlled states’ efforts to redistrict setting off a retaliatory cycle in which Republican-controlled states do even more to draw their maps so as to foreclose any possibility of Democratic competitiveness. Others have critiqued the measure on more purely ideological pro-democracy grounds: a district that is drawn in such a way that the outcome of the election is never really in doubt, they say, is one that cannot be said to be truly representative: it means, necessarily, that the power of dissenting voices is muted, and that the process of deliberation, argument and persuasion that is supposed to characterize a healthy democratic process will be confined only to primary elections, if it happens at all.It is worth taking each of these objections on their own terms. The first critique, that Prop 50 will spur conservatives to redraw their own maps in retaliation, fails as a causal argument: it does not make sense to say thatRepublicanswill be made to behave in antidemocratic ways by Democrats’ actions when they are already doing so without those actions. The Republican party, I would observe, has not needed any incentive of retaliation or revenge to redraw maps that secure permanent seats for themselves: they have been willing to do this for its own sake, in the total absence of Democratic reciprocation, for years.It is only after the battle against Trumpism has been won that we can mourn what fighting it has made usThe second critique, I think, is more substantive, reflecting not just a tactical disagreement about how to confront the Republicans’ anti-democracy turn, but a kind of melancholic desire for a different country than the one that the US has become. It is true that in a better world – in the world that mostDemocrats, I think, yearn for and aspire to – Prop 50 would be distasteful to our principles, and not mandated by our situation. It is not good to pack and crack disfavored demographics; it is not good for politicians to select their voters, instead of the other way around; it is not good that elections are rendered non-competitive. That these measures have become necessary in order to slow the authoritarian creep of Trump’s power and lessen the amount of suffering he is able to inflict is sad; it is a sign of how far we have fallen from something more like a democracy. But they are necessary. It is only after the battle against Trumpism has been won that we can mourn what fighting it has made us.If Congress does not in practice have lawmaking, war making or appropriations power, what is it, exactly, that Prop 50’s five new Democratic house members will be sent to Washington to do? One thing that Congress still retains is subpoena power, and the power to investigate. Even in our era of sclerotic politics and congressional atrophy, it has made use of that power to great effect. In 2027, if Prop 50 passes and California’s new Democrats are sworn in, they will find themselves a part of a body with the power to investigate Trump, to televise their hearings into his actions and to compel members of his inner circle to testify. It’s not nothing, and more importantly, it’s not anything that any Republican would do.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsUS CongressOpinionHouse of RepresentativesDemocratsCaliforniaTexasRepublicansTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Can you WFH too?Read moreKarlene Chandler lived two hours’ travel away from Westpac’s nearest corporate office. Her working from home hadn’t been a problem before January this year, when Westpac reversed its prior approval for her flexible work conditions, and instead demanded she comply with company policy to work two days a week at an office.Chandler challenged the policy under section 65 of the Fair Work Act. This holds that workplaces must enfranchise workers they’ve employed for more than 12 months with the accommodation of working from home to meet the obligations of various life or carer circumstances.You know – like parenting a school-age child.Chandler had been employed by Westpac for more than 20 years. Fair Work noted her work for the banking group had been completed “very successfully” and she and her team had “performed at a very high level” under working-from-home conditions.Yet somehow doing her job and doing it well wasn’t the issue for Westpac. Fair Work noticed in its judgment the$133bn companycould not actually provide “reasonable business grounds” for denying Chandler’s request.What Westpac did provide, in response to Chandler’s challenge, should be listed in a textbook as the purest definition of “cultural miff”.Apparently, Chandler’s “present circumstances had arisen because of life choices and preferences of the applicant and without the imprimatur of Westpac”.Yep, Chandler had moved house – and had children, can you even believe it? – without considering the delicate fee-fees of Westpac management’s corporate culture in these decisions that weren’t about her job nor impeded her capacity to do it.Demonstrated here was the Australian corporate equivalent of aprima noctalevel of entitlement, in which the cultural habits of workplace management are so ingrained they override the reality of the work itself.Because while Westpac has been arguing to the commission there was an inherent value in employees attending an office in-person, it is simultaneously running operations across hundreds of locations in Australia, as well as in the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, mainland China and the Asia-Pacific region, and I don’t think everyone involved is starting their day with a person-to-person meeting and pep rally.I think they’re using the miracle of modern telecommunications to service core business, which is – spoiler alert – why capitalism didn’t collapse when the killer virus Covid-19 trapped the entire corporate world in their homes for a year.So let’s drill into just what is being defended when multibillion-dollar corporations literally argue that allowing Chandler to simultaneously do her job and manage the school run might “undermine the bank’s ability to enforce its work-from-home policy on other employees”.Doing so may clarify for failed Australian prime-ministerial aspirant Peter Dutton why his forced-return-to-work policy for public servants blew up in his face last election and why he was obliged to retract it.Women won the right to equal pay in Australia in 1969, to equal pay for work of equal value in 1972 and the right to work without sex discrimination in 1984. But as we’ve taken our place as supposedly equal partners in the workplace, we haven’t seen commensurate enfranchisement of equality in the home.Women make up more than 70% ofprimary carers. In 2021, when Chandler moved south of Sydney, 54% of families reported the primary carer of the household’s children was a woman;in only 4%was it a man. Current research identifies Australian women’s “triple-care burden” of simultaneously managing parenting responsibilities, caring for elderly relatives and going through perimenopause themselves – all while holding down jobs.‘No-brainer’: why Victoria’s work from home laws could benefit the regionsRead more“Performing at a very high level” at work in such circumstances should get you a bloody medal, not a trip to Fair Work.Westpac’s complaint about “life choices and preferences” performs an energetically emetic function when you consider how absolutely uninterested corporate Australia has been in making those choices any easier. If Westpac decides it wants private-sector urban housing to become an actual thing in this country, its leadership on such a novel development would be much appreciated. Meanwhile, it is staggering that while women arehalf of the workforce, a mere 4% of the 7,000+ corporations that report to theWorkplace Gender Equality Agencyprovide any form of on-site childcare for employees, while the overwhelming majority provide no childcare assistance at all. At all.Research demonstrates the majority of work-from-home experiences report job performance gains fromimproved concentration and engagementwithreduced work-life conflict. In fact, one of the strongest risks associated with work-from-home is collapsed boundaries between home and work,leading to overwork.Sure, there are jobs that will always oblige in-person contact, and no one is saying that face-to-face engagement can’t be useful if efficiently managed.But anyone who has ever sat in a team meeting drawing doodles while their brain screams a list of all the other work-related tasks they could otherwise be doing is right to wonder just why any employer is still so invested in maintaining the overheads of enforced office attendance.It’s about maintaining traditional hierarchies in which management can simultaneously abrogate responsibility to the community while maintaining cultural habits of control. I don’t think any modern worker needs to delve very deep into the empirical research to work out the cultural cohort who perceives most benefit from that.Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsIndustrial relationsOpinionWestpacWomenBusinessWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

CDs. Clothes. Piles of e-waste. Drawers of kitchen utensils rarely used. Pens! How many pens does a household need?! Then there’s my non-digital archive – dozens of notebooks, clipped articles, jottings and research material spanning almost 40 years in journalism and authorship of 10 books. All must be culled while I have the wherewithal.‘Pack plenty of blankets or towels’: how to start thrifting secondhand furnitureRead moreMy parents, well into their 80s when they could no longer live quite so independently, were extricated from a family home that was not only decaying around them – but jam-packed with stuff.Every cupboard and each drawer in every room was full. I recall the house was already overflowing with things when my mum and dad were in their early 70s and an older aunt died … and left everything to my father. He seemed to take it all. Think bad ceramic figurines and other knick-knacks, dozens of tea towels, doilies (to which I have a visceral aversion), white goods and old televisions (straight into the double garage to accompany the kitchen cupboards and sink that had been replaced in my parents’ 1970s renovation), yet another dining set and countless books mostly about British royals and the Irish famine (go figure!).In fairness to our parents, their house alsoharboured the childhood detritusof their progeny. School books and uniforms. Other clothes. Obsolete sporting goods. Leads and blankets and baskets – even food – for long dead, fondly remembered pets.Circumstances dictated we deal with Mum and Dad’s belongings when they downsized to a smaller, safer and more manageable home while they still had acuity a few years before they died. I’m surethe great shedding of thingsfelt like something of a liberation for them – although Dad did keep retrieving items from the skip.We’ve just been through this process again with another close relative who is less conscious of what’s happening. It’s been a distressing, painful, even traumatic process – a form of intense grieving, really, for a loved one still living.Anyway, it has delivered me to this place of reflection where I must further declutter and liberate myself from stuff. A starting point, of course, is to curb consumption; to “just stop buying shit’’ as a mate who recently dramatically downsized puts it.Do I really need to replace my phone every two years? Could my next laptop be recycled rather than brand new?Outgrown but not outworn: how toy swaps are tackling waste in Australia, one teddy at a timeRead moreTo that end, I’ve started borrowing from the library rather than buying books and as I look about the shelves all around me right now, I’m wondering if so many of the beloved titles I see but haven’t read in years might better serve other readers. Perhaps if I haven’t reread a book inside three years it should go? If I need it again, I can always borrow it.Thoughts of legacy become more poignant with age. What of true importance will I leave behind – beyond landfill? Will my kids’ sadness be compounded by their guilt for cursing me while they throw the detritus of my life into skips or recycle what they can at thrift shops?All of these thoughts are, of course, knotted up with issues of global, national and community economic and social injustice in a world where the homeless, starving and oppressed – people who’ve literally had everything taken from them – are omnipresent.With that in mind, it’s got to be far better for the privileged to leave this world with less. To give it away to those who might use and value it – and to otherwise diminish our stuff well before we expect to die.Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnistExplore more on these topicsRecyclingOpinionEthical and green livingWasteOlder peoplecommentShareReuse this content"

That will endanger us allDanny Stone is chief executive of the Antisemitism Policy TrustMon 27 Oct 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 07.04 EDTShareThe Metropolitan police has beenlauded in some quartersfor deciding that it will no longer investigate so-called non-crime hate incidents, in order to allow officers to “focus on matters that meet the threshold for criminal investigations”. Against the context of headlines describing the Met as the “thought police”, something was bound to give. “Goodbye and good riddance to ‘non-crime’” wasone joyful take in the Spectator.But make no mistake: this is a shortsighted, premature announcement. It threatens the victim-led approach to policing thatresulted from the Macpherson inquiry, which followed the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence and egregious police failures. It’s bad for society, for vulnerable people in society and for policing.The bar for illegal hate is high in the UK, and rightly so. Not every incident reported to the police is a crime, but it is right that people feel safe – especially when at their most vulnerable – and are encouraged to report what has happened. It is sensible that harm can be identified and extremism prevented. Too often in the debate about these non-crime incidents – bogged down in the trenches of the culture wars – the view of those they are there meant to protect is absent.There are three principal ways in which police response to non-crime hate incidents benefits both the police and society. First, they can help protect vulnerable individuals. One tragic example is inthe case of Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her severely disabled daughter Francesca Hardwick following a decade of torment by local youths. Though there were 33 incidents reported to the police, they targeted different members of Pilkington’s family at different locations, and the dots were not connected. Many of those incidents should have been recorded as non-crime hate incidents. The Independent Police Complaints Commission’sreport foundthat the failure to consider the overall harm to the family prevented the interventions that could have protected them and prevented the tragedy.The second benefit is that cumulative behaviours can be better understood and addressed. The case of two men prosecuted in 2009 under the Public Order Act for inciting racial hatred was not only important for establishing precedents about UK jurisdiction relating to online hate, but provides a good example of how a picture of racial incitement can be proved from individual posts that might not constitute illegal activity when considered in isolation.The third benefit is that non-crime hate incidents form the backbone of intelligence that can assist in diagnosing harm, and failing integration. The Commission for Racial Equality once had local race equality councils and other bodies that could feed evidence of local tensions, particularly around elections, into a central knowledge bank. That function no longer exists. Non-crime hate incidents can help police to better understand and ultimately provide interventions to prevent scenes like those we have seen around migrant hotels.Many arguments have been marshalled against non-crime hate incidents but they do not stand up to scrutiny. Fears are raised about data retention and disclosure, despite no known example being cited of the release of such information as part of any formal disclosure process. Critics say these incident types lead to a “chilling effect” on free expression, but the same critics express themselves freely – in parliament, in the media and elsewhere.They cite the cases relating to police contact withAllison Pearson of the Daily Telegraphorthe writer Graham Linehan, but in both instances, these were cases of alleged crimes, not non-crimes, and even then both investigations were dropped by police.The police statement about its intention to drop non-crime hate incidents makes little sense. While these incidents won’t be investigated, they will – according to the force – still be recorded. However, in reality, they weren’t investigated anyway – there is no power of arrest in relation to a non-crime hate incident.The fact is that if non-crime hate incidents are abolished, something will be required in their place. If the Crown Prosecution Service judges something not to be illegal, do we ignore it? Surely most people would wish to see the incidences of men dancing in celebration of the heinous 7 October attacks at least forming part of the intelligence picture. I fear without this approach, we will be gazing into a future of multiple public inquiries, exploring why action was not taken to prevent serious harm.This is not to say that the reporting or handling of non-crime hate incidents doesn’t require reform, and that is whya review is taking place.To judge the outcome of that review before the investigation has concluded is premature, and the police pronouncement about its intention to stop investigating these incidents risks skewing the balance between genuine concerns relating to what form they take and the protection extended to the people who will pay the price of abolishing them.

Don’t worry, the wellness industry has a very pricey solution for youViv GroskopLion’s mane mushroom, maca root, collagen concoctions: there’s a menopause gold rush out on social media’s wild frontierMon 27 Oct 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 15.53 EDTShareAwoman gets to a certain age and all she wants is to be left alone. No chance. Writing in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health, a group of academics warned recently of a “menopause gold rush” leaving women vulnerable to financial exploitation, misinformation and, frankly, a sweat-inducingly gigantic avalanche of advertising. A lot of this activity has been driven by – guess what? – social media. One respondent told the researchers: “Everything I know about the menopause I learned on Instagram from other women.” As gold rushes go, this has got to be the one you’d least like to see dramatised in a Hollywood movie: “Quick, Bianca, activate the algorithmic analysis of the campaign for the vitamin B6 supplement!”The academics warned of “a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit”. So now, instead of talking about the treatment and management of menopause, we are talking about how to cope with an equally pernicious condition and one that seems to have no cure or end: the ubiquitous commercialisation of menopause.Whereas alucky minorityof womencan sail through the naturally occurring real-life menopause without any symptoms at all, the entirely manufactured condition known as “meno marketing” is now likely to affect 100% of the adult population. This is purely my personal guesstimate. But algorithm or no, I find it hard to believe that even men have escaped the clutches of the Instagram ads for bladder pills, vitamin supplements, health-giving smoothies, calming gels, collagen concoctions and skincare solutions, all formulated with menopause in mind and often cheerfully pushed by celebrities with followings of all ages and genders. “Christmas is coming – why not treat your mum?”I don’t want to spoil anyone’s retail therapy. And if maca root, ashwagandha orlion’s mane mushroom(all offered with menopause in mind) are your poison and you want to consume them with your eyes wide open, then be my guest. But do we really have to have so many things with exotic names marketed to us endlessly as the easy-to-swallow solution to a highly complex andunder-researched issue?There would surely be an outcry if anyone prescribed lipstick as an essential menopause aid. (For topical application. Although, frankly, there are days when I would eat anything.) But it struck me recently that the mood-enhancing effect of lipstick might be as significant as any medical placebo. And it’s certainly a cheaper and more reliable pick-me-up than many of the menopause aids on the market. Indeed, I became so convinced of this genius money-spinner that I looked it up to see if anyone else had already thought of it. And, lo and behold, there are already several brands of lip balm marketed under the banner of “menopause management”.The biggest problem with menopause is that there are about13 million womenin the UK experiencing it at any one time. And the slowly dawning realisation that these women might be slightly underserved after centuries of demonising female ageing has unfortunately coincided with the high-water mark of aggressive capitalism. The impulse to rinse the market has eclipsed the need for public education.I wouldn’t mind if it weren’t so nakedly foolish. After all, as far as market segmentation goes, this seems like the least niche market ever. How can 13 million human beings all benefit from the same specialist products in the same way at the same time? The truth is, you can’t. But the algorithm doesn’t care about that.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In menopause, you can have a nonexistent experience (some women don’t notice it happening and have no symptoms). Or you can feel so bad that you start to think life is not worth living:one in 10women in this cohort have suicidal thoughts. Or you can be in between those two extremes, with any combination of the 100-plus documented menopausal symptoms. No two women’s experiences of the “same” life event are necessarily remotely alike. In short, this demographic is so vague and meaningless as to be a marketer’s dream.I suspect this would all be less annoying if there were – as the academics recommended – a proper information campaign about symptoms, treatment and expectations. As things stand, my guess is that most of us know far more about the contraceptive pill than we do about hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It’s pretty obvious who stands to benefit from that state of affairs and it’s certainly not menopausal women.We need a happy medium in the world of menopause, where it is a phenomenon that is neither constantly being marketed at us nor swept shamefully under the carpet. We have gone from a time when the word was barely spoken aloud to an era when it’s hard to find a podcast that is not discussing testosterone gel. The sad thing is, I’m not sure we are any better informed about menopause, HRT, hormones or women’s cycles than we were 20 years ago. Buying the social-media-marketed equivalent of a shovel – the biggest money-spinner in the original gold rush – is not going to make anything better.Viv Groskop is a comedian and author of How to Own the Room:Womenand the Art of Brilliant SpeakingExplore more on these topicsMenopauseOpinionWomenWomen's healthSocial mediacommentShareReuse this content"

It was reported as if it would be ofreal consequenceto his political future – but enough time has passed, I figure, to confirm that it was not. Why did some seriously consider this a turning point? Because Jenrick had said something genuinely explicit and unambiguous – no dog whistle, no gesture, no disguise, no metaphor. Though he claimed “it’s not about skin colour”, it was a naked reference to race and an evident rebuke to British communities where there was a predominance of people of colour.The lack of consequence, however, was unsurprising, because within the public sphere the question of racism has been rigged for quite some time and the rules around who gets to say what about race in Britain have been rewritten. What Jenrick did, then, was to truly test the boundaries by outraging them – and signal what those in public life can now get away with saying after a concerted effort to erode the dignity of public racial discourse. His colleagues have wasted no time in answering this call. Katie Lam, a so-calledrising star of the Conservative party, last week called for legally settled familiesto be deportedto make the UK “culturally coherent”. How quickly the goalposts move.Public discourse on race has never been free from defensiveness, denial and attempts to undermine it. But still, over the years, as the prevailing ideology of the mainstream right has been reconfigured, so too has its approach to race. The old one-nation Tories still bought into a liberal consensus – that there was such a thing as systemic disadvantage against racial minorities, and this was reflected across key areas of policy, from health to justice to education.David Cameron had no issues publicly discussing racism. If anything, it was a key feature of his modernisation of the right. It even put himat odds with Oxford Universitywhen, in stating that the low number of Black students matriculated there was “disgraceful”, he misled on the real figures. He went on to bluntly say that Britain “still has a problem with racism” and work cross-party with David Lammy to tackle racial biasin the justice system. Theresa May didn’t mince her words on race and racism, either: during her time as home secretary, she criticised the police force for being “too white”. May was, to my mind, the only home secretary and prime minister to take seriously the fact that police powers, particularly on stop and search, needed reform because of theirmisapplication to Black men. Years after her premiership, May would say that she was “woke and proud”.This is not written in praise of Cameron or May. Austerity politics had a disproportionate impact onminority communitiesand May’s hostileimmigration legacy includesthe Windrush scandal, one of the greatest modern injustices against Black Britons (though I wonder how much public outcry there would be if this story broke today). These are deprivations and harms that cannot be forgiven simply because they acknowledged the existence of racism. And yet, they acknowledged it. There was some recognition of reality, and some level of consensus that Britain must work better for Black people and other minorities.So how did the right shift the dial so drastically that racism became the great unsayable? Well, resentment brewed. The idea that ethnic minorities and particularly Black people were beginning to enjoy some kind of special consideration took hold. In 2012, Linda Bellos, then chair of the Institute of Equality and Diversity Practitioners, warned of this when May looked tojettison parts of the Equality Act– specifically, to repeal a clause that imposed a “socio-economic duty” on authorities. Bellos said: “People will get the impression that black people have additional advantages … because this government walked away from something that could have been beneficial to the white working class.”Irrespective of this, under austerity and decades of neglect the white working classes, as well as other working-class communities, did get poorer. But the idea of whiteness as an axis of disadvantage was premised on the outcome of white school pupils, whopersistently underperformedcompared with their peers from other ethnic groups. The idea of a cohesive disaffected “white working class” that was the specific victim of racial injury became popularly deployed by politicians in the late 2010s,sowing divisionbetween disadvantaged groups and even driving andobscuring the reality of inequalityin certain regions in the UK, particularly after Brexit.View image in fullscreen‘The discourse on race became increasingly narrow during Boris Johnson’s premiership.’Photograph: Victoria Jones/PAAll the while, the mean position of the right in Britain became further entrenched in anti-migrant sentiment, adopting a growing notion that Britain was not working for its “native” population. There was no “white privilege”: in fact, too many privileges and advantages had been conferred ongroups that were “other”. The conversation around race and racism became increasingly dislocated from examinations of systemic bias or oppression, and fixated on individuals and the label of “racist” as a means of character assassination. This trend was particularly prominent during Boris Johnson’s premiership, where assessments of his “rightwing provocation” focused on past statements about Muslim women wearing burqas being like “letterboxes”, andlanguage used in a 2002 articlereferring to “flag-waving piccaninnies” and tribal warriors with “watermelon smiles”. These were unambiguously racist statements. And yet the media obsession with them indicated a narrowing of the discourse on race: it became a question of what someone thinks and feels, which is moredifficult to ascertainbecause few public figures admit to being racist, rather than of the real material effects of racism, which became increasingly marginalised.So now here we are, in 2025, facing an onslaught of racially charged rhetoric around migration, communities and integration, with the public sphere totally gutted of its faculties to deal with it. That is because racism has become thoroughly detached from “serious” politics. To discuss it is ridiculous, protest-y, an inconvenience. And not a single claim or allegation of racism is allowed to pass without a confected frenzy over how charged it is to even raise the subject. Last month, when the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, was asked if she thought Nigel Farage was racist, she said that he was “worse than racist” for his dog-whistle politics. On similar lines, Lammy claimed that Farage “flirted with Hitler Youth” as a schoolboy (he was forced to walk back from this statement). What was apparent from the public reaction to these comments was the belief not only that it was wrong to level what has been reduced to a petty, personal jab at a political opponent, but also that it was an unserious matter. Borders, Channel crossings,“Boriswave” migration: those are real areas of concern to British people. What flirtations Farage, or Johnson, have had with racist language are not. And racism is reduced to that: language. Not outcomes in education, health, employment or justice. Of course, within this rigged arena, Jenrick experiences no consequences for talking about a lack of white faces. The question isn’t what discipline he might face but, having come out unscathed, how much further can he go?This has been one of the key successes of British ultra-conservatives – the question of race can confidently be undermined in the public sphere. It is evidently burdensome for even Keir Starmer –delayed and limp as he wasafter the summer of riots, and the recent far-right demonstrations in Westminster – to name racism and provide reassurances to people of colour in the UK. Meanwhile, the right has set its sights on burning down any movement for the progress or systemic correction for the outcomes of British minorities. Why else would Rupert Lowe, who was elected the Reform MP for Great Yarmouth and now sits as an independent, be so fixated on the existence of the 10,000 Black Interns Foundation, which provides paid work experience and internships to Black students and graduates? Lowe revels inthe word “racism”being stripped of its meaning and power, yet he describes the programme as “racist filth”, and the Spectatorbacks him up. The reality is that the legal profession continues to suffer from “chronic underrepresentation of Black talent” – but in this inverted reality where“two-tier justice” mythsprevail even where there is real, evidencedanti-Black racism in policing, facts are of no relevance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reform MP Sarah Pochin openlycomplains about advertsbeing “full of Black people, full of Asian people” (she later apologised, but maintained that these adverts were “unrepresentative of British society”). As Oxford addresses its underrepresentation of Black students, the Telegraph investigates the university and accuses it of “social engineering”. Multicultural Britain is “yookay”, a corruption of the social order caused by successive generations of migrants. In the summer, GB News vox-popped a Black autistic man, humiliating him for his lack of knowledgeof British history. This was seen as a step too far, and even condemned by Tommy Robinson. Yet it was another means of testing the boundaries of acceptable discourse. What is practised on the fringes soon becomes mainstream. And it doesn’t take long. At Tory conference, Jenricktargeted Lammyfor getting his Tudor history wrong and not knowing which blue cheese paired with port.

This will be the ninth election for theTweede Kamer(second chamber), the Dutch parliament’s legislative chamber, in this still young century. In some ways the Netherlands has become the Italy of the 21st century, plagued by political fragmentation, governmental instability, and radicalisation (accompanied, increasingly often,by violence).This election is a direct result of this fragmentation and instability. The far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by Geert Wilders dominated the last ruling coalition, but stillpulled the plugin July, after less than a year. The various lessons that the Dutch media, political parties, and voters have drawn from this tumultuous experience should be relevant beyond the Netherlands, given that most European countries are struggling with a similar challenge: how to deal with the increasing electoral, ideological and political success of the far right.Like everyone else, the Dutch media was taken by surprise that Wilders let “his government” fall and have tried to make sense of it. Compared to 2002, when an even more chaoticcoalitionfell after just 12 weeks, there is a lot less debate about whether the far right should have a role in Dutch politics – almost as if it has become impossible to imagine a Dutch future without it.This is not surprising, as most Dutch media remain a (largely voluntary) hostage of the far right. The man himself barely graces the media with appearances or interviews, yet Wilders has beenthe most discussed politicianon Dutch television. And in his physical absence, the media have given Joost Eerdmans, leader of the radical right JA21 party, disproportionate prominence, while a tacticalleadership changein the extreme-right Forum for Democracy (FVD), where Lidewij de Vos has succeeded Thierry Baudet, did exactly what it was intended to do, by returning the party to the spotlight.Dutch political parties have mostly helped to normalise and rationalise the far right. Some rightwing parties haveruled outfuture coalition agreements with Wilders and the PVV: not because of Wilders’ anti-constitutional ideology but for his “immature” and “irresponsible”behaviour. In fact, rightwing parties continued to pass far-right policies in parliament after Wilders left the coalition. These included the “strictest asylum policy ever”, a (stricter)burqa banand even an “antifa ban” – strikingly, the latter a proposal of the FVD, the only far-right party that is supposed to be excluded from power by acordon sanitaire(fire wall), at least nationally.Even “centrist” politicians continue to normalise the far right. Rob Jetten has moved his socially liberal D66 party to the right on issues such as culture and immigration, embracing a kind of communitarian patriotism, and does not rule out governing with the radical right JA21 or the radicalised farmers’ party, BBB. Frans Timmermans, leader of the centre-left GreenLeft/Labour(GL/PvdA), has sharpened the party’simmigration policies, spoken of a “refugee problem”, and appeared on the far right’s favourite TV programme, Vandaag Inside – ironically, to the chagrin of many of the programme’sloyal viewers.But as always, voters still seem to prefer the original to the growing number of far-right copycats. Although Wilders’ PVV has lost some support,roughly 4% downon the last election result, it is clearly the most popular party in the country.Most volatility comes from the implosion of two of the newer parties,the BBBandPieter Omtzigt’s New Social Contract (NSC), which were in the outgoing coalition but now poll at 2.5% and 0%, respectively. Their voters seem to have gone (or returned) mostly to the Christian Democrats (CDA), which is slated to be the big winner. The conservative VVD, the former party of ex-prime minister Mark Rutte which has dominated Dutch politics this century, is expected to lose about a third of its already diminished 2023 electorate, mostly to the radical-right JA21.The left, unable to break the far right’s stranglehold onthe media (particularly the chatshows), remains rather marginal and stagnant – despite the recent merger of the Greens and Labour into GL/PvdA.Interestingly, polls show that the main movement is within the three electoral blocs, ie the far right, the centre-right, and the left. Each bloc maintains largely the samesupport– 35%, 40%, and 25% respectively – but within the far-right bloc, JA21 becomes the second biggest (after PVV), while in the centre-right bloc CDA, and possibly D66, overtake the VVD.Of course, opinion polls can be wrong, and increasingly in the Netherlands they are wrong, as more and more people wait until election day to make up their minds. Still, there is no doubt that the coalition formation process will be hard and long, even by Dutch standards.Almost all parties have excluded Wilders, but some (such as the VVD) have also ruled out doing deals with the centre-left. So, even if the GL/PvdA became the biggest “democratic” party, Timmermans would still need a change of heart from the VVD to become prime minister at the head of a broad centre-right coalition. Alternatively, the Christian Democrat leader Henri Bontebal could lead a centre-right government which involved less personal friction but would still be vulnerable to instability.Whatever the eventual outcome, one thing is already clear: despite the far right’s evident failure in governing theNetherlands, it retains a magnetic hold over the country. Party politics remains fragmented yet dominated by the mainstreaming and normalisation of far-right frames and politicians. Liberal democratic parties devote more energy to fighting each other than the far right. As far as acordon sanitaireholds, it does not extend to all far-right parties (like JA21) and rejects its behaviour rather than its ideology. These are trends that we see both in the European parliament and in many other European countries.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Let’s celebrate the haunting beauty of Australia’s gum trees this HalloweenJess HarwoodFrom skeletal spectres to portals to the underworld, eucalypts have the power to thrill and chillSun 26 Oct 2025 21.07 EDTLast modified on Sun 26 Oct 2025 21.14 EDTShareThe spooky season is upon us and, whileHalloweenis not a longstanding tradition here down under, we love treats, dressing up and telling ghost stories. Halloween is here to stay, so why not make it a truly Australian festival?If you’ve ever caught sight of an owl roosting in an old, hollowed-out eucalypt or the silhouette of twisted gum branches reaching like fingers across the moon and felt a touch of mystery and magic, then consider the haunting side of Australia’s beloved trees:1. Ghost gums aglow on moonlit nightsView image in fullscreenIf I ask you to picture Australia’s ghost gums, you’ll likely conjure up sunny images of bone-white tree trunks set against rich red rock escarpments, such as in Albert Namatjira’s beloved paintings. But catch them at night under a full moon to see their full, ghostly glory! Their branches become a skeletal spectre in the desert, their stark trunks luminescent apparitions.Named after their ghostly white bark, a number of ghost gum species are widespread in central Australia.Eucalyptus aparrerinjais probably the most recognisable species (although its taxonomy is a live issue), found from Western Australia across the south of the Northern Territory to Barcaldine in Queensland.If you can, why not take yourself on a walk to see these trees at night?2. Ancient giants to give you the tinglesView image in fullscreenSetting foot in a tingle forest in WA is a portal to past worlds. Eucalypts are ancient, they’re first in the fossil record52m years ago. While Australia experienced huge climatic shifts since the continent was part of Gondwana, the south-west of WAexperienced much less change. The fact the forest here is dominated by tingle trees, especially the red tingle (Eucalyptus jacksonii),also gives it an otherworldly and prehistoric feel.RIP plastic pumpkins: simple tricks for a greener HalloweenRead moreThese trees can have a base circumference as large as 20 meters and some old giants manage to live on, despite beinghollowed out by fireover generations.As you step inside the hollow of these trees through the gaping mouth in its trunk, it’s a bit like crossing over a threshold to the other side. The air is damp, earthy and close. Sound is muted by the soft ground and woody walls of the tree. Are you now in the underworld? If you gaze up into the dark core of the tree, it’s like peering into its very soul.Go visit them, you’re sure to get the tingles.3. Witchy trees with a message from the futureView image in fullscreenThe haunting form of the Miena cider gum (Eucalyptus gunnii divaricata) looks as though it’s from a book of spells as its branches twist and turn in all directions. Miena dieback looks even more scary and, to be honest, if you want to be truly spooked for Halloween this year, nothing is more terrifying than the dual climate and biodiversity crises impacting our landscapes.The Miena cider gum is endemic to Tasmania and isone of the most cold-toleranteucalypts. But as the climate heats populations are dramatically declining. Listed as endangered, the story this gum tells of the warming climate and its impact on our trees is enough to send a chill down your spine.4. Zombie eucalyptsView image in fullscreenWe have all seen those blackened trunks rising out of charred earth in the aftermath of a bushfire and wondered: will they return from the dead?Contrary to popular belief, not all eucalypts can survive bushfires.Ninety per cent can resprout. Resprouting eucalypts reshoot green leaves, some from a lignotuber (a woody swelling at or just under the ground), a few from the stem, but many from both. Unlike spotting a zombie, seeing the new green shoots springing forth from ashen bark is a welcome return from the other side.5. The ghoulish hands of the warty yateView image in fullscreenA warty yate flower bud.Illustration: Dr Dean Nicolle/Currency Creek ArboretumFinally, I asked Dr Dean Nicolle, a scientist and eucalypt expert who has planted every species of eucalypt at his Currency Creek Arboretum in South Australia, which eucalypt spooked him the most.Dean suggested the warty yate (Eucalyptus megacornuta). Knobbly, warty and full of character, the flower buds of this tree look like drawings of ghoulish hands from a book by the Brothers Grimm. The long, finger-shaped parts are the bud caps, called the opercula. I’ve included Dean’s photo here instead of a drawing, otherwise you might not believe it was real.Happy Halloween, here’s wishing you a spooky eucy season!Explore more on these topicsTrees and forestsOpinionClimate crisisHalloweenBushfirescommentShareReuse this content"

It is the leading infectious killer of the continent, responsible fornearly600,000 deaths a year. Cases are rising and there is an urgent need for more funding, yet western donor countries are instead cutting back on aid. We still hear brave talk about eliminating malaria. But an expertreportnow warns of a potential resurgence that could add almost a million more deaths to the annual toll by the end of the decade.Most of the money to fight the mosquito-borne disease – 59% – comes through the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Its executive director, Peter Sands,saidlast week at the World Health Summit in Berlin that of the three killers, the one that kept him awake at night was malaria.This could be the canary in the coalmine. Malaria kills far more quickly than HIV or tuberculosis. The impact of funding cuts and aid diversions and thescrappingof USAID by Donald Trump, which housed so much global health expertise, will be seen in the malaria figures faster than in most other diseases. But mankind’s despoliation of the environment is also in play.The climate crisis is altering rainfall patterns and enabling the spread of mosquitoes. The parasites they carry have developed someresistancein east Africa to the artemisinins, the best drugs we have against the disease. It happened with chloroquine and with every other malaria drug, and undermines the effectiveness of artemisinin-impregnated bed nets as well. There was a window of real opportunity while the drugs had full power, but it’s closing. The other hope is vaccines, and some have been developed and rolled out, but although they offer about 50% protection against death from malaria in the first year – for a child fortunate enough to get vaccinated – they do not stop transmission.Cases surged in 2023, the latest for which we have figures, reaching 263m, which was 11m higher than in the previous year. The report, from a group of agencies including Malaria No More UK and the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, supports the call of the Global Fund for more money. Data analysis shows the damage that will be done if malaria control slips – and the hugely positive impact on African lives and economies if pressure on the parasite can be maintained. Reaching a2030 annual funding targetwould save 1.86 million lives and boost African GDP by $231bn, as healthy children stay in school and become economically productive rather than a cost to society. But a 20% cut would lead to 82,000 more deaths and a drop in GDP of $5.14bn. A severe cut in funding would mean 990,000 more deaths as malaria prevention collapses, and a GDP drop of $83 billion.Worryingly, the second scenario is already on the cards: Germany has promised €1bn to the Global Fund, which is a 23% cut on previous contributions.Malariais a really hard disease to beat, but it can be done and it would surely be unthinkable to let the killing climb again. The UK, rumoured to be considering a 20% cut, and other countries, must find the funds however tight their budgets, to save voiceless children’s lives.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Now Peter Doig is celebrating his love of music with an exhibition at the Serpentine in London that pairs recent paintings with his favourite records played through an extraordinary sound system. So we asked other contemporary artists what music means to them.View image in fullscreenAn extraordinary sound system … Peter Doig’s exhibition House of Music at Serpentine Gallery, London.Photograph: Guy Bell/Shutterstock‘I never tire of Stevie Wonder’s Songs in the Key of Life’Harold OffehThere was a lot of music in my house growing up. It’s only recently I’ve come to appreciate the richness of it. My family is from Ghana so there was a lot of highlife, afrobeat, African gospel – now I think it’s amazing, but back then it was just my parents’ music. One of my uncles lived with us for a little while. He used to play a lot of Grace Jones, and I grew up with the Island Lifealbum, which was the starting point for my Coversseries. I decided to restage images of performers from the 70s and 80s. All roads lead to Grace Jones.Favourite music:I never get tired of Songs in the Key of Life by Stevie Wonder. It’s a double album and the scope is extraordinary. I loveAs – the soulfulness of it. It’s a ride.Peter Doig: House of Music review – intoxicating paintings with a banging soundtrackRead more‘My life is pretty drenched in music’Ragnar KjartanssonI remember walking to school in Iceland in winter as a teenager listening to the Cure on my Walkman. Plainsong, the first song off their album Disintegration, goes: “It’s so cold, it’s like the cold if you were dead.” That was always fun when it was freezing and I was trying to dress swanky for school, listening to the Cure pumping gorgeous melancholia into me.My studio by the harbour in Reykjavik is kind of a hangout for musicians. Sometimes I’m painting and my friends are playing Bach on the piano. My life is pretty drenched in music. I listen to it as I work, as I do the dishes. I love listening to it with my teenage daughter, it’s an awesome thing to do driving around in the car. You can imagine how happy a moment it was for us whenOlivia Rodrigo collaborated with Robert Smithfrom the Cure.Favouritemusic:At the moment it’s Sabrina Carpenter’s Manchild, but the piece that profoundly affected my approach to art is Dichterliebe by Robert Schumann, deconstructing romanticism at the height of romanticism.View image in fullscreenChris Ofili: ‘Sonic arrangements can be colourful.’Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian‘I mourn the decline of radio’Chris OfiliWhen I worked in my studio in King’s Cross in the late 90s, playing music would help to drown out the urban soundscape. Now, in my hillside studio in Trinidad, insect wings, raindrops and birdlife are my background music, so I have to choose what I play very carefully. Vocals and sonic arrangements stimulate thoughts and emotions and can be colourful too – all considerations when making paintings.I’m still mourning the decline of radio across the airwaves, when music permeated for free through tiny speakers, from passing vehicles, shops and cafes, and big soundsystems. Radio DJs introduced me to so much great music. But just as a reproduction of a Giotto fresco doesn’t compare to seeing it in the Arena Chapel in Padua, some recorded music fails to capture the complexity of hearing it performed live. In Trinidad, hearing steel pan music performed outdoors by an orchestra is hair-raising.Favourite music:These days, I’m listening toSaultin my studio. Interweaving the Black experience, faith, love, spirituality and mystery, their experimental albums ring true for me.‘Fireboy DML revived me when I was making nudes’Joy LabinjoI often listen to the same song over and over again, and I can always recall what I was listening to when I was making a certain body of work. I was obsessed with Peru by Fireboy DML, which came out in 2021, when I was making my nudes for Lagos. It was the height of the pandemic and I had Covid. That song was really helpful. It would bring me alive again after lunch when I was crashing.When I’m painting, what I’m looking for is a trance-like state in which I’m not thinking about the music too much. So familiar songs are most helpful. I’ll listen to new songs in the car, and then once I’ve got a level of familiarity, I can bring them into the studio where it feels more intimate. My Spotify-liked songs are what get me going.Favourite music:Right now it’s Sade’s Babyfather, just for the beat and how it makes me feel relaxed. It’s old, but new to me.‘I listen to people talking about how awful the world is’Jeremy DellerI think an artist’s relationship to music is no different from anyone else’s. However much we think we love music, we’ll never love it as much as theChappell Roanfans I saw on telly at Reading festival this year. Maybe we as adults want to get back to that state of ecstasy. I’ve worked with musicians loads, but I barely have music on when I work at home because it’s too distracting. I tend to listen to people talking about how awful the world is.Favourite music:John Cage’s 4’33”. It helps me think.View image in fullscreenLindsey Mendick: ‘My best friend is a pop star.’Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian‘Self Esteem’s anthems push me to be braver’Lindsey MendickBefore I was thinking of being an artist, I wanted to be a singer. I was a massive Spice Girls fan. When I first started listening to them aged seven, I didn’t realise the world wasn’t tipped in women’s favour. I just saw women taking over the world and being really powerful. My first installation would probably be the shrine to them I created in my childhood bedroom.My best friend is a pop star. She’s calledSelf Esteem. We met about 10 years ago in Sheffield; people said we wouldn’t like each other because we’re both strong female characters. Her songs are anthems for women who don’t fit in the box of what you’re meant to be. They push me to be braver. I use music to pick me up – often sad girl bangers. Sometimes in my studio I sing really forcefully, and my assistants are like, “It’s one ofthesedays …”Favourite music:Beyoncé’s Lemonade. In that album she seemed so empowered, honest and raw.‘I used to listen to opera full blast’Tom HammickI was artist in residence at the ENO and Glyndebourne, so I’ve had to listen to a lot of opera. There’s a connection between the framing of opera – at night, with a spotlight – and the way that, as a romantic painter, I’m picking up on drama. I’m an expressionistic painter, and you can pick colour out of the darkness in the same way that happens in opera.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I remember being at a house party; a few of us were tripping. As the night progressed, this 90-minute mixtape was playing on a loop, and it just became embedded in my psyche. It wasn’t until later that I realised it was the sound of electricity I was becoming fascinated by.I used to call myself a composer because my installation and sculptural work is sound-based and unfolds both visually and acoustically through time and space. Then I was asked to propose a commission for the Royal College of Music, and they grilled me. I thought: “There are people who go to music school and train, who can read and write music, who reallyarecomposers.” So I realised it wasn’t going to cut it.Favourite music:My own track: Ceasefire Algorithm. Also, the Korgis’ Everybody’s Got to Learn Sometime.‘I photographed the Clash for their first hit’Caroline CoonI’ve always lived on streets annually freed for Notting Hill carnival, where British pop music has been redefined. Early on, the spirit-raising rhythms were steel band calypso and soca. By the 1970s, huge soundsystems blasted out reggae. Naturally, carnival floats and DJ soundsystems appear in my urban landscape paintings.In 1976, like the Clash’s Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon, I was at the carnival when Black youths rioted. This anti-racist protest inspired the Clash’s song White Riot, which became their first hit single with one of my early punk photos of the band on the cover. For me, music and art are inseparable – I like to feel music rhythms in my painting compositions. Choosing what music to play is part of my daily ritual.Favourite music:This summer, A Mass of Life by Frederick Delius has been my favourite, played continuously – fabulous sequences of massed choir colour.View image in fullscreenLaure Provost: ‘The guts of my videos is sound – the image is the facade.’Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian‘I love recording dripping and scratching’Laure ProuvostMine wasn’t a household full of music, but there was a lot of nature – the sound of the wind and birds. Where does music start? Is it birdsong in the garden? The sound of a kettle getting madder and madder with boiling water? Music is everywhere, though of course there are moments when it’s intensified and you’re more conscious of it.I’m from the film and video world, so sound is a material that I work with. I remember Peter Cusack, one of my teachers years ago at Saint Martins, saying, “You have to make your own sound.” I also work with musicians. I’ve worked with people to make a catchy song that takes you galloping through the fields, and to create the sound of a wave splashing in your face. I also love recording things like dripping or scratching on my iPhone. The guts of my videos is sound; the image is the facade.Favourite music:I Put a Spell on You by Screamin’ Jay Hawkins. It’s a classic.Jean-Paul Goude’s best photograph: an androgynous Grace JonesRead more‘I found my way back to art through music’Mark LeckeyWhen I went to art school, learning about theory was an obstacle to creativity. The way I found my way back to making art was through music. If I wanted to make a new work, or I was thinking through ideas, I’d start listening to specific songs that I would use as a blueprint. I’d think: “I want to evoke the same things this song is inducing in me.”What I love about music is that it’s democratic, but it also allows you to access something beyond your own experience. It can be both local and avant garde. Why does art struggle with that?Favourite music:I used to listen toTrip II the Moon (Part 2) by Acenbefore I made anything. It’s the most ecstatic record I know, but undergirding it is a kind of melancholy.Peter Doig: House of Music is atSerpentine South Gallery, London, until 8 FebruaryHarold Offeh: Mmm Gotta Try a Little Harder, It Could Be Sweet is atKettle’s Yard, Cambridge, 15 November to 1 MarchExplore more on these topicsArtPaintingPop and rockOperaClassical musicDance musicRagnar KjartanssonfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I went on holiday and Dave Cummings, who’d written for Harry Enfield and Chums, did the first draft. I came back and took over. A month later, it was all happening. It was really quick.We were given a few millionto shoot over 12 days in Ibiza. The nightclub scenes were all filmed in one day and night at Amnesia. The scene in which Kevin and Perryget puked onby some clubbers was filmed in the afternoon. We invented the Inbetweeners basically! They couldn’t shut the club in the evening, so the crowd weren’t extras. They were actual clubbers, having a good night, and the DJs were actually DJing. I said to DJs Seb Fontaine and Roger Sanchez: “Do you mind if I just come and interrupt your set?”I’d won best actress at Cannes – but most of the parts I was offered afterwards were extremely boringWhen I was that age, it was punk. We’d go and see the Clash and the Pistols. They’d be horrible to us and we’d go: “Brilliant!” I once asked Pistols drummerPaul Cook: “Can you write something funny on my trousers?” So he wrote: “Something funny.” Eyeball Paul, the character played by Rhys Ifans, is our equivalent: the nastier he is to us, the more we like him.The notorious scene in which poo goes into my mouth wasn’t in the script. Originally it was a scene where Kevin and Perry went on a boat trip with the girls, who all ignored them. But when we got to the jetty to film it, there was no sign of the boat. Ed Bye, the director, said: “What the fuck are we going to do?” We had to think of something else. I’d been swimming at the same beach a few years before and there had been a great big human poo next to me. I said: “Get a bit of polystyrene, paint it brown, put some sweetcorn on it like eyes and pull it with fishing line so it looks like it’s going in my mouth. And Kathy, you go in the water and look like you’ve just shat in the sea.”The film is fun and silly, but quite sweet because you feel sorry for Kevin and Perry. It’s very English. When they screened it in America, people hated it so much they wanted to burn the cinema down. In France, the poster read: “Kevin et Perry, un film trash.”I’m a bit too old for a sequel now. I did once write Kevin and Perry Go to Wizard School, but nobody ever replied. That’s the English film industry, I’m afraid.Kathy Burke, played PerryI’d been one of Harry Enfield’s “Chums”, playing Waynetta Slob, Lulu the Toddler and Perry. I’d just won the 1997 best actress award in Cannes forNil By Mouthwhen Harry said he might be able to get funds for a Kevin and Perry movie. Was I up for it? I thought: “Too right, mate!”I left the script to Harry and Dave Cummings. Louisa Rix continued in her role as Kevin’s mum, Mrs Patterson. Perry and Mrs Patterson have this little twinkle between them: Perry is very much in lust with Mrs Patterson and she is very much in amusement with him. It was always great fun working with Louisa.Since we were playing a couple of hormonal, randy teenagers, Harry and I were fitted with electronic penises that worked by remote control. Sexy ladies walked past and – boing! – up went the appendages. The crew were a lively bunch too, and we’d congregate in a bar at the end of a day’s filming and drink Choccy-Woccy, a lethal brandy, vodka and milk chocolate concoction that Rhys Ifans invented. It went down far too easily yet for some reason caused minimal hangovers.A Mind of My Own by Kathy Burke review – a brilliant, blunt and beautiful memoirRead moreWhen we did the press circuit, I was surprised by how many journalists asked if this kind of comedy movie was maybe a bit lowbrow. Most of the parts I’d been offered since Cannes were extremely boring – just carbon copies of my previous roles. As a woman in my mid-30s, when else would I have the opportunity to play a 14-year-old boy? It’s surprising but very lovely that, nearly 30 years on, people still talk to me about Kevin and Perry. They hold a special place in some old hearts. As Perry would say: “Fank yoo!”Harry Enfield and No Chumsbegins touringin March.

But do the insides match the outsides?Oliver WainwrightMon 27 Oct 2025 01.00 EDTShareAcluster of serrated concrete bunkers has landed in the heart of Princeton University’s leafy campus in New Jersey, sending tremors through this tweeOxbridge fantasyland of gothic turrets and twiddly spires. The new addition’s brute, blank facade gives little away from the outside. Wrapped in rows of vertical grey ribs, contrasting with the arched windows of the surrounding stately stone halls, it has the look of a secure storage facility, keeping a beady eye out through a single cyclopean window.The vault-like quality is fitting. This bulky new bastion is a repository for the university’s astonishing collection of art and antiquities – a 117,000-strong haul spanning everything from Etruscan urns and medieval staircases to expressionist paintings and contemporary sculpture. Previously housed in a hodgepodge of extensions and additions accrued over decades, the collection can now shine in its own purpose-built castle.A Roman mosaic pavement, excavated in the 1930s, depicts a drinking contest that could be straight from the student barThe building might need its thick skin – and not just to deter Louvre heist copycats. ThePrinceton University Art Museumis the first major project by the Ghanaian-British architect David Adjaye to open since 2023, whenthree women accused him of sexual assault and harassment. Adjaye has denied the allegations and no charges were brought against him, but the scandal saw his meteoric rise swiftly turn into a dramatic fall from grace. Numerous projects around the world were cancelled. But Princeton pressed on.View image in fullscreenShowcase … some of the museum’s 117,000 objects on display in the grand hall.Photograph: Courtesy of the Princeton University Art Museum“We were about 60% complete,” says museum director James Steward. “So we couldn’t exactly tear the building down.” Instead, the university distanced itself from Adjaye Associates and handed over day-to-day coordination toCooper Robertson, museum specialist architects, who had been intimately involved since the beginning. Adjaye has not been on site and has not been invited to the opening – which, in a ghoulish turn, will take place on Halloween.We were about 60% complete. So we couldn’t exactly tear the building downThe allegations cast a cloud over what is one of the finest art museums to be built anywhere in recent years. For once, the absence of a celebrity creator allows attention to fall on those who led the project after Adjaye stepped back – chiefly Marc McQuade, former associate principal at Adjaye; Erin Flynn, partner at Cooper Robertson; and Ron McCoy, Princeton’s in-house architect. Together they have conjured a place of rare substance and craft that revels in its theatrical spatial effects and sensuous material details, standing at the historic centre of Princeton’s campus with a timeless air.As you approach the complex, which is partly hunkered down in a hollow, the blunt facades of the nine raised gallery pavilions seem to soften at ground level, with terraces and ramps leading you into the museum on all four sides. The principal entrance, beneath a low overhang, opens into a dramatic four-storey space, where acolossal mosaic figure by the artist Nick Caveleans forward in a riotous gesture of welcome. Passing through this pharaonic canyon, visitors reach a lower, darker entrance space, before reaching a lofty welcome gallery where daylight floods in through upper windows, and a grand staircase beckons to the galleries, mirroring a 15th-century limestone staircase from Mallorca, displayed on the wall opposite.“We wanted it to feel like an open thoroughfare,” says chief curator Juliana Ochs Dweck, standing at the crossing of two routes that slice through the building, north-south and east-west, following the line of pre-existing paths across the campus. “If the students happen to see a couple of works on their way through, and get interested in the arts, that’s a bonus.”View image in fullscreenEnticing views … the grand stair and orientation galleryPhotograph: Richard Barnes/Courtesy of the Princeton University Art MuseumBeneath her feet, protected by a glass floor, is a third-century Roman mosaic pavement. Excavated from a site near Antioch in the 1930s by a team of Princeton archaeologists, it depicts a drinking contest that could be straight from the student bar. Nearby hangs a vibrant pink and green abstraction by the great minimalistFrank Stella, painted the year he graduated.Continuing along “the artwalk”, you come to the grand hall, a triple-height space where hefty concrete buttresses jut out overhead, supporting two-metre-deep wooden glulam beams that frame skylights above. Corner glazing provides tempting views of the ceramics collection that awaits upstairs, while sliding oak panels can close the windows off for events, as retractable seating and a stage cleverly slide out. The space has inescapable echoes of Louis Kahn’sYale Center for British Art, only beefed up. The sandblasted concrete gives a rugged, geological quality, the sheer size of the structural components lending a brawny heft. There are hints of Ivy League one-upmanship: this is Kahn on weight-gain formula.It’s nice to have a sit-down on your travels between Africa, Asia and the ancient Mediterranean, via the AmericasUpstairs, the sequence of galleries is brilliantly judged, switching size, height and colour to avoid museum fatigue, and banishing that all too familiar feeling of traipsing through endless indistinguishable white rooms. “This is not a museum that has embraced a white cube display approach since at least the 1980s,” says Steward, who has been director here since 2009, co-curating around 150 exhibitions. “We used colour as a way to grapple with the design flaws of our previous building.”Each of the 32 galleries has a different hue, ranging from pale greens to deep blues, with some walls upholstered in richly patterned fabrics, echoing the stately drawing rooms where some works once hung. Immaculate display cases designed byGoppion of Milanallow dense groupings of objects to sing, from netsuke sculptures to snuff bottles. Behind the scenes, the mechanics have been cleverly tucked away into the V-shaped wooden beams that span the ceilings, carrying the air-handling and lighting tracks, while daylight is brought in via reflective solar tubes, spreading an even wash across the rooms.Tucked into the corners of the building, three chapel-like spaces offer visitors a more contemplative encounter with certain works. Entirely lined in timber, with built-in furniture and picture windows framing views back out to the campus, these sequestered rooms provide welcome moments of respite between the nine themed gallery zones. It’s nice to have a sit-down on your travels between Africa, Asia and the ancient Mediterranean via the Americas. While the previous museum had an unfortunate upstairs-downstairs separation, with many visitors never reaching the African and Asian galleries below, the new building puts everything on one level, roughly doubling the display area in the process. With no clear order or hierarchy, the idea is that you wander at will.View image in fullscreenGesture of welcome … the mosaic by artist Nick Cave.Photograph: Joseph Hu/Princeton University Art Museum“We want people to get productively lost,” says Steward. “The hope is that visitors will have accidental encounters on their way from A to B. We put our temporary exhibition space, and the restaurant, as far from the front door as possible, to force people to encounter different things on the way.”There are plenty more details to enjoy, from the auditorium with its walls of pink felt-covered ribs, to the chainmail curtains that seal the galleries off after hours (the public areas will be open until 10.45pm every night). Then there are the study rooms and endless seating nooks built into the walls, both inside and out, as well as terracing that extends into the landscape, providing a venue for outdoor events in the warmer months. The impressive quality of construction – particularly unusual in the US – is the product, says McQuade, of endless prototyping and material testing, a testament to the client’s exacting standards and the precision of the contractor, LF Driscoll.‘It has a heroic, Roman quality’: how Arkansas’s timber university building could revolutionise architectureRead moreDavid Adjaye’s institutional work, at scale, has often been disappointing. HisIdea Storesin London are flimsy exercises in jollying up public libraries – and they are now showing their age. HisNational Museum of African American History and Culture, in Washington DC, sports a dazzling skin, butit is clumsy and underwhelming inside. HisSugar Hill housingin Harlem, New York, similarly prioritises its eye-catching wrapper at the expense of the homes within. As they have grown in size, Adjaye’s projects have all too often giventhe impression of someone in a hurry.Whatever caused the Princeton museum to be leagues ahead – perhaps a combination of experienced lead architects, collaborative contractors and a model client – its success is clearly down to much more than one man, whose name still hangs above the office door.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureMuseumsDavid AdjayePrinceton UniversityHigher educationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the summer of 2000 and DeJohnette was in London to play with Keith Jarrett’s Standards Trio. Referring to him in my first question as a “drummer” felt reasonable enough, but DeJohnette didn’t appreciate being pigeonholed and shot back instantly: “I’m a complete musician.” A few days later, sitting in the Royal Festival Hall watching the Standards Trio, a moment of transcendent magic thrilled me as Jarrett sustained a long sequence of repeated notes high up on the piano and DeJohnette powered the music forwards with a labyrinthian drum solo as harmonically searching as anything Jarrett had played. Complete musician indeed.“The idea of improvisation,” DeJohnette told me, “is tied up in the very nature of our existence. We don’t expect our life to evolve without changing and we never know what’s round the corner – why should music be any different?” He further explained that each part of his drum kit he considered to be a musical being “in its own right”. He designed and tuned his cymbals to his own specification. Mix the sound of cymbals with the drums and then “you think harmonically on the kit,” he added. The sounds inside DeJohnette’s head could never be contained by the conventions of drum technique. He was also a pianist of considerable merit – who released a solo piano album, Return, in 2016 – and every facet of his musicianship seemed to be on display all of the time, untilhis death this week aged 83.View image in fullscreenJack DeJohnette.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsMany drummers tune their kit to a bespoke design, but DeJohnette’s playing exhibited a life-force that was entirely his own. To hear him play on What I Say from Miles Davis’s album Live-Evil is to marvel at apparently superhuman drive as he maintained an impactful funk/rock beat for 20 minutes. DeJohnette, who also played on Davis’s epoch-defining Bitches Brew, had by 1970 become the trumpeter’s drummer of choice in a meeting of mighty musical minds. His drums rooted What I Say deep in the Earth and allowed Davis, and subsequently saxophonist Gary Bartz, all the space they needed to explore, while DeJohnette packed his playing with rattling rhythmic asides – keeping a continual discussion with the other musicians.His own 1968 debut album, The DeJohnette Complex, immediately proposed that his was a voice intimately connected with a jazz scene exploding in a thousand directions around him, while he remained doggedly independent. The compositions DeJohnette wrote for his album were harmonically ornate and asserted jazz/rock energy while also occasionally leaning towards free-form improvisation. He featured himself playing melodica, and his folky melodic inventions soared.The DeJohnette Complex demonstrated that DeJohnette’s aesthetic was indeed delightfully complex and, after leaving Davis, he was signed to ECM Records. In 1976 he releasedUntitled, a hectic quintet album, but also Pictures in which he played piano, drums and organ, and duetted on some tracks with guitarist John Abercrombie, an album that was sparse and bare-bones in contrast to Untitled.His 1981 ECM album with saxophonist John Surman, The Amazing Adventures of Simon Simon, became a landmark moment for both musicians, and a much-loved classic too. Surman and DeJohnette played their usual instruments while also doubling on keyboards and synthesisers, subsuming their own identities inside lavishly orchestrated soundscapes of pastoral tones. Another essential album was Oneness, recorded in 1997, which dealt up large-scale structures with pieces such as Free Above Sea and Priestesses of the Mist, their titles mirroring the elemental force unleashed by the music. Listening to that album around the time of its release, I was reminded of an earlier encounter with DeJohnette, when I heard his group Special Edition play in Leeds during the late 1980s. This performance was in no hurry to stake out its terrain, as ambient, slow-burn forms gradually telescoped towards rhythmic blows.‘Jazz isn’t about perfection’: drummer Billy Cobham on Miles Davis, Massive Attack and still learning at 80Read moreTalking to DeJohnette all those years later, these ideas of stress-testing form and scale made more sense. He told me how he loved playing those funk figurations with Davis because “I could sit in grooves and let them saturate me”, but also spoke of his desire to generate more wide-angled musical soundscapes, always open-ended and therefore healthy for the brain. He complained about the “safe confines” of pop music with its repetitive patterns. “With improvisation, though,” he said, “you’re open to a full range of possibilities. People are capable of being very creative but only seem to tap into their potential when there is a major earthquake or something. But if people were more conscious of our place within nature, stopped abusing the Earth and put things back into it, we would have a healthier environment and society.”No question that DeJohnette heard his music as modelling those idealist aspirations. “Art is the spiritual equivalent of that purification, which is passed to us as energy – and all artists have to draw on that.”Explore more on these topicsJazzMiles DaviscommentShareReuse this content"

Back then, his debut album Introducing the Hardline According to Terence Trent D’Arby went multiple-platinum, he was seen as the new Prince and told the world he was a genius. However, D’Arby’s career plummeted after the critical savaging of his more experimental second album and in 2001 he changed his name to “create a new identity that wasn’t traumatised by the ‘fall from grace’.” He walks on for his first UK tour in almost a quarter of a century to a hero’s welcome. The flowing dreadlocks have gone, but his glistening pate suits him and he retains his impish grin, quipping: “I only went out for some cigarettes, but took 23 years.”Maitreya’s band the Sugar Plum Pharaohs bring the funk and high-ranged backing vocals. His own voice, very briefly raspy, remains an astonishing instrument, capable of airy sweetness and gut-wrenching raw power. The extended high falsetto note at the end of Delicate receives its own spontaneous ovation. The Academy is busy rather than full, but the singer feels the love. “This is what clubs are for,” he yells.View image in fullscreen“Get up outta your rockin’ chair, grandma!” … Sananda Maitreya and band.Photograph: Wes OrshoskiThe set list, split by an interval, spans decades and genres, from psychedelic funk to pretty balladry. Billy Don’t Fall, a Motown-y gem from that ill-fated second album, is sung with sublime emotion.

A beautifully plaintive Let Her Down Easy and soulful Holding on to You suggest that he never stopped writing terrific songs, even if fewer people heard them. “Get up outta your rockin’ chair, grandma!” he yells, by way of the introduction to a stupendously funky Dance Little Sister, which has the whole crowd singing.

The fledgling rapper had been getting into trouble at his school in London so, in a bid to rectify this, they packed him off to boarding school in Enugu inNigeria. “Some people out there just didn’t understand me,” says Knucks, as we talk at his record label’s office. “Like, in Britain people are saying, ‘Go home.’ But people in Nigeria were like, ‘You don’t belong here either.’”Boarding school proved to be a challenging couple of years for Knucks, whose real name is Afamefuna Ashley Nwachukwu. He swiftly picked up a handful of “nemeses”, including the most popular boy in the year, who threatened him on his first day and warned him to stay away from his girlfriend. Miles from the place he called home, and without amenities such as a washing machine, Knucks found solace in a friendship with the school cook. “She was my mother figure,” he says. “If I was sad or homesick, I would go to her.”When I returned from Nigeria the temperature had changed. Everyone was talking about Giggs and Talkin’ da HardestTales from Knucks’s two years in Nigeria feed into his new album, A Fine African Man, which finds the 30-year-old reflecting on “where I stand in the world, what kind of person I am, how my values are influenced by things that happened back then”. On the song Cut Knuckles, he compares the luxuries of his current life (“Now I’m watchin’ the brand new stuff that I got gettin’ tumble dried”) with memories of having to handwash his clothes in Enugu (“No washing machine / Man wasn’t a teen / But was washin’ my clothes by hand / Cut knuckles, the water stang”).Knucks has spent the past decade taking his narrative-driven, conscious lyricism to the very top of British rap. When his breakthrough single,21 Candles, was released on SoundCloud in 2015, his musings on the impermanence of friendships marked him out as relatable and introspective, vulnerable even. You can hear those qualities again on new track Are You Okay?, which contemplates the limits of fame and money; and on Three Musketeers from his 2022 debut album Alpha Place, which is about his experience of survivor guilt, and on which he reflects on being the only one of his trio of closest friends to have escaped the daily battles and tensions of his Kilburn housing estate. Alpha Place racked up millions of streams and earned the Mobo award foralbum of the year, in a win shared with Little Simz (for herSometimes I Might Be Introvert).Knucks tells me it was during the summer before secondary school that he first got into making music with friends from his estate. When he got to secondary school there was a recording studio, so “during lunchbreaks, me and seven friends went and recorded eight-bar after eight-bar”. Grime was the obsession of the schoolyard before he was sent to Nigeria, but when he returned in 2008, “the temperature had changed”. Road rap was in: “Everyone was talking about Giggs. Talkin’ da Hardest had just come out.”View image in fullscreen‘At lunch we recorded eight-bar after eight-bar’ … Knucks.Knucks was using soul samples and “high-pitched female vocals”, rather than the electronic production of grime, and as he absorbed classic albums by Nas and MF Doom, his transition towards hip-hop continued. Nas’s Illmatic was particularly foundational to shaping his own music, even inspiring the name of Knucks’s first mixtape, Killmatic. “The rawness, the lyricism, the stories, how hungry Nas was: I saw a lot of that in myself.”It wasn’t only the musical landscape that was changed when Knucks returned from Nigeria. In northwest London, he had been surrounded by diverse communities, but by the time of his return to the UK, his family had relocated to Watford in Hertfordshire, where he attended a “very white” school. Before, Knucks had been known as Afamefuna or Afam. Now he felt humiliated whenever his name was butchered in assemblies. When the headmaster suggested he go by his middle name, Ashley, he “jumped at it”.Does he regret dropping his Nigerian name? Yes and no. It was an adaptation strategy, he says. Plus everyone just calls him Knucks now anyway (a shortening of his nickname “Knuckles”, which came from a playground game and hisfavourite Sonic character). Still, he also felt some shame about it, he says, something he documents on new track My Name Is My Name, and across the album in general. (A Fine African Man is, after all, an acrostic of Afam.)View image in fullscreen‘No washing machine / Man wasn’t a teen / But was washin’ my clothes by hand’ … Knucks.Knucks has traversed drill, soul, jazz infusions and classic boom-bap hip-hop over his career – and now he’s tapping into West African cadences. Nigerian influences suffuse the album. When he visited in 2023, he stood at the bus stop by his old boarding school and recorded the conductors, eventually incorporating these field recordings into the tracks. On Masquerade there’s the use of an ogene, a cowbell-like instrument used during masquerades in Igboland, and the ojà flute, which you may recognise from Nigerian singer Kcee’samapiano hit Ojapiano. “I’m making an effort to put these instruments in there so people from home can relate to it on a deeper level,” says Knucks.With his parents having been strict enough to send him to boarding school in Nigeria, I wonder how they responded to his rap aspirations. Knucks says they were actually warm to the idea, but also insisted he go to university. (He graduated from UCA Rochester with a degree in animation and computer graphics). They also had confidence in his manager and mentor, Nathan “NRG” Rodney. Before he died in a car crash in 2018, Rodney had become one of the great influences in Knucks’s life, helping him course-correct whenever egotistic or selfish instincts took him in wayward directions. Knucks’s voice shakes when talking about NRG’s death: “It put me in a rut, because I had mad love for him. He was like an older brother.”You can sense Rodney’s guidance in A Fine African Man’s blossoming maturity. Four years ago, when Knucks’s father was transferring money to friends and relatives in Nigeria, the rapper asked if he could add some for someone else he considered family: the cook who had looked after him at boarding school. She had become bedbound and unable to work, and when the money reached her she was apparently moved to find she had made such an impression on Knucks. Her story is retold on the album’s track Yam Porridge, which includes intimate memories of her own late father.“I made the effort to tell the story from her perspective,” says Knucks, “and to leave myself out until the end.”A Fine African Man is released on 31 October on NoDaysOffExplore more on these topicsHip-hopRapNigeriafeaturesShareReuse this content"

With a novel about a pot-smoking Chinese‑Jewish autograph hunter, the dangers of fame and the shallowness of pop culture, of course.The Autograph Manbegins in full wisecracking throttle with three boys in the back of a car on their way to watch a wrestling match between Big Daddy and Giant Haystacks at the Royal Festival Hall. As 12-year-old Alex-Li Tandem gets Big Daddy’s autograph (the start of an obsession), his own daddy drops dead from a brain tumour. Unfortunately, the rest of the novel doesn’t quite live up to the prologue. The critical heavyweights of the time didn’t pull their punches:“A poky, pallid successor” (Michiko Kakutani, who hadrapturously reviewedWhite Teeth, in the New York Times), “cartoonish” and full of“misplaced ironies and grinning complicities”(James Wood in the LRB). Others were more generous. Whatever. Smith was just getting stuff out the way.View image in fullscreen7The Wife of Willesden (2021)Given Smith’s talent for dialogue, it was only a matter of time before she wrote a play. Her first, and only, work for the stage is a riotous reworking of The Wife of Bath’s Tale from Canterbury Tales, transported to an open-mic night at a pub on the Kilburn High Road. Chaucer’s Alyson becomes Alvita, a five-times married Jamaican-born British woman in her mid-50s. Her voice, “brash, honest, cheeky, salacious, outrageous, unapologetic is one I’ve heard and loved all my life”, Smith writes in the introduction. “She’s been that bitch since 1983,” the audience is told. First performed at Kilburn’s Kiln theatre, it transferred to the National in London (you can still watch it on theirwebsite) and to New York. Bawdy and brave, here is a woman speaking her truth down the centuries.View image in fullscreen6The Fraud (2023)Smith’s first foray into historical fiction is based on the Tichborne trial of 1873, when an East End-born butcher living in Australia claimed to be the long-lost heir to a fortune. She found the story on herdoorstep: the scamster is buried in an unmarked grave in Willesden, where the novel, like nearly all Smith’s fiction, is set. With its dangerous populist hero, peddling conspiracy theories and fake news, this Victorian drama has plenty of contemporary resonances. The writing is as smart and assured as ever. Many criticsloved it. But, perhaps because it rests on plot (never Smith’s strongest point) rather than character, for me the novel lacks the flesh-and-blood vitality of her earlier fiction. We read Smith to show us how we live now.5Swing Time (2016)“I wanted to express how it is to be in the world as a black woman,” Smithsaidof her more sombre fifth novel. In 1982, two little girls from neighbouring estates meet at a dance class in a Willesden church hall. Reinvention, celebrity, motherhood and – ahead of its time – cultural appropriation are all touched upon in a novel that zigzags deftly through time and place. Smith is at her sharpest on the subtle codes of class and race. From Barbies and the Argos catalogue to goths and MTV, she captures growing up in the 80s and 90s, to a soundtrack of Michael Jackson and Rakim. If the social commentary becomes a little heavy-footed at times, the central story of female friendship, in all its jealousies, rivalries and betrayals, never falters.View image in fullscreen4NW (2012)Childhood loyalties and the conflicting yearnings for freedom and belonging are also at the heart of Smith’s most experimental novel. It is fair to say that critical opinion was divided: “clunky”, “weirdly contrived”, with “paper doll characters”, snipedKakutaniagain;“a joyous, optimistic, angry masterpiece”, “her best”, cried others. Set in north-west London – obviously – NW covers familiar Smith territory, but with the spirit of Woolf rather than Dickens on her shoulder. The optimism of her early fiction has been replaced by “existential bleakness”, in Smith’s words. If you read novels to know what thingsfeellike, what the author calls“the concrete ‘thingyness’ of people”, rather than for what happens, you will sink into the thirtysomething lives of Leah and Natalie against the Kilburn summer of 2010. If not, move on. Magnificent in parts; infuriating as a whole.View image in fullscreen3Feel Free: Essays (2018)In the UK we are suspicious of the essay form – too intellectually showy, perhaps – whereas in the US it is a badge of distinction; all the cool writers are at it. Thank goodness, then, for Smith, who has emerged as one of our liveliest thinkers as well as storytellers. The subjects in thiscollectionrange from Justin Bieber to Brexit, Jay-Z to Hanif Kureishi, Joni Mitchell to Schopenhauer, the climate emergency, her childhood bathroom, and joy, all corralled by a formidable intellect and wit. Here is Smith thinking on the page about the things that matter most to her (books, music, film, injustice, freedoms of one kind or another). Be warned: reading Smith’s essays will make you realise you have floated through life with the critical acuity of an amoeba. But you will emerge better for it. And she is always great company. A new collection,Dead and Alive, is out this month.2White Teeth (2000)“White Teeth is the literary equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing 10-year-old,” Smith herself, then anonymously and now famously, opined in the small literary magazine Butterfly. Everyone else was busy comparing her to Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie, Hanif Kureishi and even Dickens. This noisy, sunny story of two second world war veterans, best friends Archie Jones from Reading and Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim, and their extended families, who have fetched up in Willesden, turned out to be the novel everyone was waiting for. Smith arrived with a voice that was at once funny, fearless, philosophical and hip, and which was perfectly suited to the hopefulness of a new millennium: publishing’s answer to Cool Britannia. While the plot is slightly preposterous, the author was clearly preposterously talented. Twenty-five years later, White Teeth remains a landmark of British fiction.View image in fullscreen1On Beauty (2005)“One may as well begin with Jerome’s emails to his father,” begins Smith’s third novel, to signal that what follows is a reworking of EM Forster’s classic Howards End. What chutzpah! Two families, the liberal Belseys and the establishment Kippses (Forster’s Schlegels and Wilcoxes), from New England and Kilburn respectively, become fatefully intertwined. Art, faith, rap, race, pain and death are all wrapped up in a comic campus novel and bravura literary homage. On Beauty is the only Smith novel to have been shortlisted for the Booker prize (howisthat?); it won the Orange, now Women’s prize. Martin Amis said he read everything by Smith “with a constant smile of admiration”; this book makes your face ache. Much is made of the precocity of White Teeth. Smith was only 30 (the same age as Forster) when she pulled off this erudite, expansive and affecting novel. The author turns 50 this month.

It is her name that will be remembered in relation to the discovery of the lost king, long after Richard Taylor has faded into obscurity.”“That is the story I wanted to tell, and I am happy I did.”Coogan, Baby Cow and Pathe were not represented in court and did not attend.In the film, Taylor, played by Lee Ingleby, is shown as antagonistic towards Langley, played by Sally Hawkins, who spearheads the dig and is sidelined by academics when they seek to take credit for the discovery. Langley’s husband is played by Coogan, who co-wrote the script with Jeff Pope.In 2022, Taylor told the BBC: “I’m portrayed as kind of a bullying, cynical, double-crossing, devious manipulator, which is bad, but then when you add to that I behave in a sexist way and a way that seems to mock Richard III’s disabilities, you start to get into the realm of defamation.”Bennett said in his statement to the court that Langley “caused the remains to be found by driving forward a project to search for them” in the car park in Leicester city centre more than 500 years after the monarch’s death. He said the University of Leicester had also played a “crucial role in providing funds and academic expertise” for the project, with Taylor the “key coordinator of the university’s involvement”.Speaking outside court, Taylor, now chief operating officer at Loughborough University, said he had felt “cross” and “completely helpless” when the film was released. He said the outcome of his libel case represented “success and vindication” after “a long and gruelling battle”.Taylor said Langley’s initiation of the project and “driving confidence” had made it possible for Richard III to be found. He added: “Hers was a remarkable contribution. But it did not extend to leading the archaeological search or scientific analysis, for which she was neither qualified nor experienced.“There have been moments over the last three years when I thought, when Philippa Langley approached me for the university’s support, I perhaps should have put the request in the bin, but I didn’t, and I think I was right not to do that.“It was a fantastic piece of academic work involving volunteers, involving the Richard III Society, involving academics, from many, many universities, on an international scale. I think it’s a truly remarkable discovery, a really strong piece of teamwork.”A joint statement from Coogan, Pathe and Baby Cow said: “As a distributor and producer recognised for bringing complex, real-life stories to audiences, we are deeply aware of the responsibility that comes with such portrayals and approach each project with care, integrity, and a commitment to authenticity.“We remain incredibly proud of this film and are pleased this matter has now been settled.”Explore more on these topicsSteve CooganRichard IIInewsShareReuse this content"

After a stint in the US, he settled in the Austrian town of Kirchstetten, where he lived until his death in 1973.The public-school educated poet was in his mid-50s when he met the working-class twentysomething. “Glad our worlds of enchantment / Are so several / Neither is tempted to broach”, Auden later wrote in his poem. “I cannot tell a / Jaguar from a Bentley / And you never read”.View image in fullscreenThe front of a card from the Kurka collection.Photograph: Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH), ViennaTheir relationship appears reminiscent of the famed bond between painter Francis Bacon and his lover George Dyer, a gang-affiliated East End petty crook in London. But whereas Dyer breaking into Bacon’s apartment is a modern myth compounded by the Daniel Craig-starring biopic Love Is the Devil, in Auden’s case it was true.Though Kurka had completed an apprenticeship and was in work, he was struggling for cash. When Auden lent him his Volkswagen Beetle before embarking on a trip to the US, the young man and two accomplices used the vehicle to carry out a series of car burglaries, culminating in a break-in at the poet’s own home.They were arrested after a police chase, found in possession of stolen goods worth 34,000 Austrian schilling (the equivalent of about €20,000 today) and put on trial.Since the car was registered in Auden’s name, the court case risked making public the relationship between the young criminal and the writer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But unlike Christopher Isherwood, he was never an activist for gay rights.” Enjoying a high degree of respectability as a professor, the English writer also regularly visited the local church. “He blended in and tried to live a normal life.”View image in fullscreenA 1961 letter from Auden to Kurka.Photograph: Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities (ACDH), ViennaSince same-sex acts were still a criminal offence in Austria, Kurka’s trial risked stirring up controversy around the poet, who had won a Pulitzer in 1948 and was in close contention for the Nobel prize in literature at the time.An innuendo-filled article in Austrian newspaper Kurier on 16 October 1962 did not name Auden, who had become a dual US-UK citizen in 1946, but referred only to “one of those Americans who got stuck in old Europe with its different, much freer way to live and let live”.Instead of testifying against Kurka, Auden asked his own longstanding lawyer to recommend a good advocate to defend him. Kurka was sentenced to 15 months in prison, his wife to eight.“The whole episode was a turning point in their relationship, and a positive one,” says Neundlinger. “Auden did not know whether Kurka would give away intimate information when interviewed by police – the fact that he didn’t seems to have strengthened their ties.”“Both learned a lesson,” Auden wrote in Glad. “But for which we might still beStrichundFreier” – translated as “streetwalker and john”. None of Kurka’s letters to Auden have been recovered, but in those the poet wrote from trips to New York or Berlin back to Vienna, he is warm and candid. The older man sent Kurka and his wife money to pay for flights to visit him, as well as for English lessons, and complained about feeling abandoned by his partner, the American poet Chester Kallman. “I feel a little bit lonely and wish you were here,” he wrote in November 1964.“There may have been an idea that their relationship was purely sexual or transactional in nature”, says Neundlinger, but “these letters show they enjoyed a long and intense friendship”.Explore more on these topicsWH AudenPoetryManuscripts and lettersnewsShareReuse this content"

A press representative for ECM, the record label that released many of his recordings, confirmed the news, while his personal assistant added that he died from congestive heart failure.Able to bring dynamic, highly musical playing to open-minded free jazz, R&B-leaning instrumental grooves and everything in between, DeJohnette is perhaps best known as the drummer in Davis’s fusion period, contributing to albums such as Bitches Brew, Jack Johnson and On the Corner. He was also celebrated as a regular sideman and bandleader on elegant, progressive fusion releases from ECM in the 1980s.DeJohnette was born in Chicago in 1942 and played piano from the age of five or six, as he remembered, continuing the instrument alongside the drums which he picked up in his early teens. “Piano and drums are part of the percussion family,” he later said. “There’s no separation: learning one thing feeds the other.”He started out singing doo-wop in a vocal group and playing rock’n’roll, but was gradually drawn towards jazz, and from the late 1950s had his own trio. He guested with Sun Ra and his Arkestra, fraternised with the city’s avant-garde names such as Muhal Richard Abrams and Roscoe Mitchell, and sat in for a waylaid Elvin Jones in John Coltrane’s band when they played in Chicago: “A really great, physical and spiritual experience,” DeJohnette said of the latter gig.View image in fullscreenDeJohnette with Miles Davis, Chick Corea and Dave Holland.Photograph: David Redfern/RedfernsHe dropped out of college and moved to New York in the mid-1960s to pursue music more seriously, packing his drums along with just $28 to his name. He quickly picked up work with Freddie Hubbard and Jackie McLean, and then a more sustained collaboration with Charles Lloyd in his quartet where he played alongside Keith Jarrett – one of his frequent collaborators over the years in various units.Time with pianist Bill Evans led him to the edge of Davis’s band at the end of the 1960s, as Davis was bringing in electric instrumentation and forging beyond the boundaries of post-bop. When drummer Tony Williams left, DeJohnette was called up. “I think playing with Miles, with Dave Holland, Chick Corea and Wayne Shorter was a very exciting period,” DeJohnette said of a band that produced Bitches Brew, Big Fun and a series of acclaimed live LPs. “We always couldn’t wait to get on the bandstand to see what kind of mischief we could get into.”Davis would have his band work up monumental grooves, starting with DeJohnette: “I’d start something and if it was OK he wouldn’t say anything and it would continue, then he’d cue each instrument in and get something going. When it would start percolating, then Miles would then play a solo over that and then let it roll, let it roll until he felt it had been exhausted.”After making Live-Evil in a septet, which DeJohnette called one of his favourites of the era due to its “funky sound, grungy sound, dirty kind of sound”, he left Davis in 1971, explaining: “I wanted to play a little freer. Miles was moving into a more specific thing that he wanted from the drums, not as much freedom to elaborate.”DeJohnette also recorded his debut under his own name in 1968, The DeJohnette Complex – the first of around 50 LPs he eventually made as a bandleader or co-leader, including forays back into piano-playing.View image in fullscreenDeJohnette in 1989.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesHis ECM relationship began in 1973 with Ruta and Daitya, a duo album with Jarrett, and as well as releases in his own groups such as Compost, Gateway and New Directions, DeJohnette played with Jan Garbarek, Pat Metheny and others for the label.DeJohnette became a regular feature on albums for Sonny Rollins from the 1970s onwards, made a number of recordings with Herbie Hancock, and later became a part of Wadada Leo Smith’s Golden Quartet – in among a huge number of other recordings. He also appeared in the Blues Brothers sequel, Blues Brothers 2000.Throughout, he brought a studied musicality to the drums rather than treating them as a mere backbeat. “I am hearing orchestrally,” he said. “I guess one example would be the cymbals are to my drum set what the sustain pedal is on the acoustic piano. So I am hearing colours.”A two-time Grammy winner, most recently in 2022 as Skyline (a collaboration with Ron Carter and Gonzalo Rubalcaba) won best jazz instrumental album, DeJohnette was also named a National Endowment for the ArtsJazzMaster in 2012.DeJohnette was married twice, first to Deirdre Davenport, who he met at junior college in Chicago. He met his second wife, Lydia, backstage at Ronnie Scott’s in London in 1966 and she later moved to the US with him. They had two daughters, Farah and Minya. He named a track after Lydia on his 2001 album Time & Space, made with Dave Holland.Explore more on these topicsJazzMiles DavisnewsShareReuse this content"

Developed by the team behind the more recent films, the supernatural horror is set in 60s America, following the events of a small town with missing locals, plucky kids, gruesome goings-on and suspicious new residents. Bill Skarsgård reprises his role as the evil clown, but it’s not just him doing the petrifying.

It uses archive footage and extraordinary accounts to tell the human story of astronomical exploration – starting with Anna Lee Fisher, the first mother in space, and the brother of Ronald McNair, one of the first Black astronauts, who says his family went “from slavery to space in four generations”.HRPanorama: The King of Jordan and the Children of Gaza8pm, BBC OneWith his country bordering both Israel and the occupied West Bank, King Abdullah II of Jordan has long lobbied for peace in the region.

There he is – in shows such as Parts Unknown and No Reservations – a gonzo gourmand trekking to backstreet nooks and favela hideouts in parts of the world where celebrity chefs fear to tread. In Beirut and Congo; savouring calamari and checking out graffiti in Tripoli; slurping rice noodles and necking bottles of cold beer with Barack Obama in Hanoi, Vietnam. One course follows another, evenings drift past midnight and he’s still chewing the fat with locals, hungry for stories – about drugs, dissidence, gristly local politics.But Bourdain, who killed himself aged just 61 in 2018, had always seen himself as a writer. His mother was an editor at the New York Times, and his youthful crushes were mostly beatniks and outlaws – Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs, Lester Bangs, Hunter S Thompson. (Orwell too – especially his account of a dishwasher’s life in Down and Out in Paris and London.) A college dropout, he later signed up for a writing workshop with famed editor Gordon Lish. His earliest bylines appeared in arty, downtown publications; two crime novels (Bone in the Throat, Gone Bamboo) got decent reviews but sold poorly.Things turned around after the publication in 2000 of his bestselling memoir Kitchen Confidential. It portrayed New York’s restaurants as sweatshops, military trenches, last chance saloons for a whole bevy of social misfits. For Bourdain they were refuges. A teenager who’d been into Abbie Hoffman and Eldridge Cleaver, he later became a heroin addict, a fan of the Ramones and the Voidoids, a dive bar denizen. Week by week the city was getting Bloomberged, mom’n’pop stores giving way to salad bars and frozen-yoghurt parlours: with its swaggering, screw-faced evocation of a rawer, less pasteurised New York, his was a book of mourning as much as it was one of celebration.By 2011 HarperCollins had given Bourdain his own publishing imprint. By 2016 The New Yorker was describing him as “not actually a star … a nebula”. Now his agent Kimberly Witherspoon has compiled The Anthony Bourdain Reader, drawn not only from his best-known books, but also handwritten short stories, chapters from unfinished novels, something he calls “Another Pointless Journalistic Play” and ghost-themed comics featuring Japanese spirits with a fondness for preying on balls of flesh located inside human anuses. There’s even a travel diary entry from 1973: “My stomach and intestines hurt. I have contributed more shit and more vomit to the Florence sewer system than I did at home in a year.”This head-to-tail editorial approach won’t be to everyone’s taste. Bourdain’s fictional writing lacks the urgency and gamey flavour of his journalistic dispatches. “Good food, good eating, is all about blood, organs, cruelty and decay,” he once wrote, and some of the most memorable passages involve noshing on a braised bat (“imagine braised inner tube, sauced with engine coolant”), sampling the still-beating heart of a cobra (“like chewing on a rubber dog toy”), watching farm workers plunge a knife into a pig’s thorax (“the screaming penetrated the fillings in my teeth, echoed through the valley”). Is this the “food and travel porn” that at one stage he fears he may be guilty of producing?At his worst, Bourdain’s carnivorousness and his screeds against vegans, Peta supporters or anyone campaigning against toxic chemicals read like libertarian shtick, manna for Top Gear stans. Complaining that people can no longer smoke in bars, he huffs, “it’s only a matter of time before some well-intentioned health Nazi busts into your bedroom and yanks that post-intercourse cigarette right outta your hand”. Then again, Christopher Hitchens might applaud his anti-Kissinger diatribe: “While Henry continues to nibble nori rolls and remake at A-list parties, Cambodia, the neutral nation he secretly and illegally bombed, invaded, undermined, and then threw to the dogs, is still trying to raise itself up on its one remaining leg.”Some of the loveliest passages come when Bourdain writes with just-so tenderness and precision about his family: a journey with his brother to La Teste-de-Buch in France among whose sand dunes they holidayed as young men; the outsize pleasure he takes in his five-year-old daughter nibbling on Pecorino and an anchovy. I suspect Bourdain will be read in years to come less as a writer about food than of food work. Everywhere he lands – whether in struggling bistros, mob joints or midtown nightclubs – he warms to the subaltern caste of underpaid toilers slicing and sizzling and sweating away.One of them, a century ago, was Irish-born Mary Mallon, later demonised as Typhoid Mary. In his passionate defence of her, he talks about what it’s like to grow old as a cook. The pains in the back, the knees. Perhaps the heart. “Where once you would have turned your head to cough, you turn no longer. Wash your hands after going to the bathroom? Maybe … Unwashed hands, an errant cigarette ash, a roasted chicken dropped on a dirty kitchen floor and retrieved on the bounce … We’ve been there, you and me and Mary.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Standard critical guidance applies: what will doubtless be catnip for fans is likely to prove varyingly baffling for newcomers, arriving late to a frenetic game offering few chances for catchup. The latter camp might, however, cling to the Halloween-adjacent release date as a partial decryption device: Fujimoto’s teenage hero Denji (voiced by Kikunosuke Toya) has a chainsaw-wielding demon squatting in his soul, suggesting the twin influences of Tobe Hooper and Shinya Tsukamoto.The fallout from this will be, to coin a phrase, exaggerated – but the underlying emotions remain legible, maybe even relatable. Dopey slacker Denji is torn between two romantic prospects: notionally nice girl Makita, who appeals to his cultured side, and freckled, jade-eyed waitress Reze, who invites our boy to break into school after hours to skinny-dip. She’s a gal to elevate his heart rate; pity she’s also hellbent on ripping Denji’s heart out.The film’s artistry is undeniable: director Tatsuya Yoshihara and team sketch ultra-photorealistic urban environments, making it only more striking when Reze pulls a grenade-pin from her neck, exploding her earthly form, and when a possessed Denji, bearing chainsaws for arms, launches a counterattack atop his shark familiar.Before a final descent into exhausting city trashing, its gleeful perversity is semi-interesting: what the success of these titles tells us is that there’s an audience whose desires aren’t currently being met by Hollywood pencil-pushers. Man, is it male-oriented, though. From Denji’s frilly pink fantasies to the fact Reze becomes more pornographic in appearance the more demonic she gets, Yoshihara is not shy about courting those who might have felt uniquely wronged by the opposite sex. “What a rush!” Denji squawks, in one such incel-friendly indelicacy. “I just cut off a beautiful woman’s leg.”Chainsaw Man: The Movie – Reze Arc is in cinemas now.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation in filmAnimeMangaScience fiction and fantasy filmsJapanComics and graphic novelsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Playwright John Morton and director Jimmy Fay wring maximum dark humour from this dystopian two-hander, set in 2048 at the end of days. As Liam (Patrick O’Kane) and Edel (Anna Healy) are bunkered in a remote cottage on a mountainside, gradually being engulfed by smoke and fire, they have no idea how many more hours they have left before everything is obliterated.In the high stakes of this drama, the focus is not on possible causes of the global catastrophe, but on bringing this long-married couple to crisis point as their time is running out. What plays out, bleakly, are the different ways each character attempts to reach some kind of reckoning with their lives: through drugs and alcohol, manic boogieing or tentative prayer. While Edel tries to contact their adult children and friends, to stay in touch with the outside world on patchy phone connections, the conversations and media bulletins all bring news of death and horror.Ingeniously designed by Maree Kearns (set) and Chris Warner (sound) as a graveyard for obsolete technology, their barricaded cottage is dominated by looping digital time signals, flashing numbers and ancient video screens. As Liam hammers out his memoirs in “hard prose” on a manual typewriter, his persistence seems driven by a churning sense of guilt; he is writing a confession. “Everything is your fault”, he mutters, blaming himself, for reasons hinted at and later spelled out unnecessarily.His hands never far from his shotgun, Liam initially seems the more volatile of the pair, but Edel has her own recklessly destructive impulses. In O’Kane and Healy’s riveting, emotionally nuanced performances, their confrontations escalate dangerously. With or without the apocalyptic premise, the intensity of their portrait of a marriage burns through.Until 15 November at Lyric, Belfast, as part ofBelfast international arts festival, which runs until 9 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The Séance of Blake Manor sounds like the stuff of cosy Sunday evening entertainment. Thankfully, this folk-horror drama has much more to offer than a bit of fun for Agatha Christie fans.It’s October 1897, and you play as private investigator Declan Ward, sent to the aforementioned manor – now a grand hotel – to discover the whereabouts of one of its guests, Evelyn Deane, who has gone missing in mysterious circumstances. What you discover is a gothic mansion filled with eccentrics: from a psychic researcher wielding a spirit camera to a vodouist oungan and a Brazilian woman tracing her family roots. They are here to attend a grand seance that will take place on All Hallow’s Eve, when the phantasmagoric barrier between the worlds of the living and the dead is at its thinnest. But as you discover while you wander the ornate rooms and meticulously planned gardens via first-person viewpoint, each participant has a secret – some deadly, some tragic – and many know more about young Miss Deane than they’re letting on.View image in fullscreenAbsolutely gripping … The Séance of Blake Manor.Photograph: Spooky Doorway/Raw FuryWhat follows is, in some ways, an archetypal detective adventure, told in the visual style of a graphic novel, the art heavily inspired by the works of Mike Mignola (Hellboy) and Eduardo Risso (100 Bullets). You talk to suspects and witnesses, explore rooms for hidden clues and useful items, and slowly draw up a list of culprits. All the while, the game has an internal clock and a timetable of events that your investigations must fit into. The clock only ticks forward if you’re actively searching a location or interrogating a guest, so you must make efficient use of your detective skills, and you always need to make sure you’re in the right place at the right time to eavesdrop on clandestine meetings, or to catch useful talks on spiritualism, mythology and the history of the manor that take place in the grand drawing room.All your findings can be examined and connected via a series of graphical inventory screens, which include an evolving mind map of clues and actions. It can be overwhelming to begin with, all these systems suddenly booting into life with every letter, key and clue you discover, but you gradually get the hang of things and realise that making your own notes is a must. While it’s not as structurally innovative asBlue Prince, the game has interesting ways of prompting you in certain directions, including a word game deduction system that gets you to create hypotheses of motives and backstories with which to confront suspects.As your investigation unfolds, you begin to understand that this isn’t simply a cosy little period adventure. It is a game with a point to make. The mansion has been built on top of a site of ancient historical and religious importance, transforming it into a colonialist symbol, while the wealth of the visitors is contrasted with the poverty of the hotel’s staff in subtle and meaningful ways. This is a game about appropriation and sociocultural destruction as much as it is about one character disappearing, and as we learn about folklore and paganism, we also come to understand what the manor and its rich owners – the troubled Blake family – really represent. Woven into this is the theme of diaspora, with several guests arriving from colonised countries, seeking the answers to complex family mysteries. Here too are tales of drug addiction, abuse and grief, all carefully woven into the central narrative. There are also some genuinely spine-tingling moments as apparitions appear at the edges of your vision and things go bump in the night.The result is an absolutely gripping detective tale and a beautifully researched work of interactive folk horror to stand alongside the recent Strange Antiquities and Wadjet Eye’s seminal The Excavation of Hob’s Barrow. It completely immerses you in its world of clashing cultures and supernatural revenge, managing to explore complex themes of colonial trauma, religion and identity within the confines of a single location and event. It will have you rushing to the bookshop or library to read more about spiritualism, folklore and ancient Irish history.Sure, The Séance of Blake Manor is an autumnal treat filled with spooky scenes but it is also that most joyous of discoveries: a game that challenges, delights, thrills and educates in equal measure.The Séance of Blake Manor is out now, £16.75Explore more on these topicsGamesIndie gamesPCreviewsShareReuse this content"

After Marple, everything turned green as the valleys narrowed. It was a classic northern autumn day: the clouds were low, the mizzle and mist were closing in and the world was grey-filtered but for the glow of dead leaves all around.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.South-east of Manchester is a bit of an unknown for me. Between the city and the Derbyshire borough of High Peak, you don’t quite enter national park territory, but it’s nonetheless a charming and eye-calming landscape. TheMancunian Kinder Scout trespassers of 1932probably came this way, as do Pennine Way-farers bound for Edale. But the region is also post-industrial and close to conurbations. The Steel Cotton Rail Trail, whichofficially launched earlier this monthafter several years of planning, hopes to bring together elements of the land and the heritage while also drawing walkers and cyclists to areas of the Peak District perhaps ignored by those who rush for the main spine of the Pennines.Map of the trailThe 62-mile (100km) trail has been split into 14 day-friendly sections between the rail termini at Manchester and Sheffield, with stops along theHope Valley Linemarking the start and end points. There’s something for everyone. Urban explorers will enjoy the metropolitan mooches at either end, summit fiends will love the middle hill and moor sections, while those with young families or old dogs can opt for canal and riverside walks.I was the only passenger to alight at Chinley, a small, smartish-looking village in the Blackbrook valley. I soon found a sticker to show that I was on the right track; way marking is now complete along the route. I also had printouts of the handy pdf maps posted on the website. GPX files are available, but I didn’t want to spend the day looking phone-ward.View image in fullscreenEdale to Chinley on the Steel Cotton Rail Trail.The route, sloping downward, took me past a cafe and on to thePeak Forest Tramway Trail. As anyone who has been out on a recent country walk will know, 2025 has been a mast year, with an abundance of fruit and nuts falling from trees. I could hear the loud crunch of dry acorns and beech nuts as I began my walk towards the west.The tramway – serviced by horse and gravity-powered vehicles – opened in 1796 and carried on operating right up till the 1920s. Limestone, quarried all around the area, was taken out along these tracks. While much of the primary and heavy industrial plant has gone, I passed a polymer factory close to Chinley and I was rarely far from traffic (the mighty A6, England’s longest road once upon a time, was just beyond the curtain of trees) or light industrial units. Some people probably prefer the illusion of “real nature” but I like ambling through parts of the countryside where work and wilderness rub along. Anyway, I was always able to look down and let the golds, reds and ochres of leaf litter blur my ruminations.Some prefer the illusion of ‘real nature’ but I like ambling through parts of the countryside where work and wilderness rub alongSoon I came toBugsworth Basinon the Peak Forest canal – once the largest and busiest inland port on the canal system and the only one to survive intact. An information sign alluded to “canal mania”, the period between 1790 and the 1810s when dozens of cuts were made across England and Wales by speculators banking on “faster” logistics. In 1808, workers shifted sufficient limestone to fill 2,000 canal boats. A vital raw material, it was used in buildings, chemical manufacturing and agriculture. Limestone historians will probably challenge the steel and cotton of the trail’s name – cities edging out town and country, as ever – but you could also make a case for calling it the Millstone Grit Trail or the Coal Trail; this part of the world produced so much for Victorian Britain.I swerved right, joining the River Goyt. Despite its guttural name, the Goyt is a lovely river. It threads a pastoral squiggle from soggy moorland just east of Macclesfield all the way to Stockport, where it runs into the Mersey. As well as the new trail, I was also walking on sections of theGoyt Wayand a long-distance path called theMidshires Way. The path passed close to Furness Vale station on the Manchester-Buxton line – an alternative railway option to get to this section of the trail.View image in fullscreenThe Torrs Millennium walkway along the river Goyt in New Mills, Derbyshire.Photograph: Washington Imaging/AlamyIt was a mellow, easy walk all the way to New Mills, a town I only knew hitherto as the home town of punk/Oi! band Blitz, but which is a very dramatic constellation of magnificent bridges and stone viaducts, vertiginous gorges, fast-flowing water, the oldest community-owned hydro scheme in the land, some lovely llamas in a bosky paddock, and the sweeping steel Millennium Walkway. I’d passed a couple of rural pubs already, but New Mills has plenty of food and drink for those stopping or pausing here.I continued along the canyon – pastTorr Vale Mill, the UK’s longest-running textile mill till its closure in 2000 – and used the Goyt Way to enter Mousley Bottom nature reserve, a pretty patch of woodland occupying an area previously used as a landfill site, gasworks and sewage works.For an autumn amble, the 14 new walks are almost perfect and where you will catch several of the moods of this magical seasonI left the river behind at Hague Bar, and headed for Strines, to complete my two-stage, 6.5-mile walk, where I knew the train was hourly (it’s half-hourly from the larger stations). As fate would have it, just when I needed to speed up, the path went up too – quite sharply, in fact, as it ascended a green lane. After all the level walking, the views were suddenly much bigger, and the mist had burned off too. I was half-tempted by theFox Inn, a Robinsons’ pub in the tiny hamlet of Brookbottom, but given my now terrible thirst, bursting lungs and the one-hour wait, I knew the rest stop could easily morph into a three-pint siesta-inducer. So, I struggled on and actually jogged down to Strines to make the train for Piccadilly with three minutes to spare.View image in fullscreenThe Fox Inn in Brookbottom near New Mills.Photograph: John Fryer/AlamyThis new rail-pegged walking (and, along many sections, cycling) trail will be welcome in Manchester, where it links up nicely with the also quite new 200-mile orbitalGM Ringway. It may also tempt Sheffielders to look beyond the obvious Edale-Kinder Scout hikes – though Edale is a start/finish point for a nice 7.5-mile leg of the Steel Cotton Rail Trail. More frequent, reliable trains would make these walking trails really attractive. But for an autumn amble, the 14 new walks are almost perfect. Choose your challenge and altitude, decide whether you want trees or moors, towns or fields, and you will catch several of the moods of this magical season.Read more about and download guides at theSteel Cotton Rail TrailExplore more on these topicsTravelUnited Kingdom holidaysEngland holidaysEurope holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingRail travelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s possible to bake a global gateauGet our weekend culture and lifestyle emailHelen GohMon 27 Oct 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Mon 27 Oct 2025 18.55 EDTShareWhen Sweet, the baking book I co-authored with Yotam Ottolenghi, came out in the United States in 2017, my excitement at seeing so many people bake from it was matched only by my horror at what I saw them pulling from their ovens on Instagram: pale cakes with thick, dark exteriors.Posts from Australian and British readers showed no alarming results and I quickly realised something had gone awry in the American translation. As it turned out, the recipes had been converted in-house by the publisher, using a straightforward formula to change celsius to fahrenheit. What no one had noticed was that the conversion also needed to take into account the oven setting: fan-forced versus conventional heat. Many American ovens, it seems, still don’t have a fan function. Reader, there were tears.Scarred by that experience, the first thing I did when I signed my next American contract was to find a tester in Australia and the US who could bake every recipe in their own kitchens before a single page went to print.View image in fullscreenSmall differences in flour, sugar, cream and oven temperatures across countries can affect your cake: Pictured:Helen Goh’s pineapple pudding cake with salted tamarind caramel.Photograph: Matthew Hague/The Guardian. Food styling: Lucy Turnbull. Prop styling: Anna Wilkins. Food styling assistant: Catarina CardosoIt’s not just oven temperature, of course. Subtle differences in measurements and ingredient types in recipes can trip up even experienced cooks. In Australia and the UK, baking is mostly metric: grams and millimetres rule, but tablespoons in Australia are 20ml while in the UK and US it is 15ml. It seems minor but that extra teaspoon can affect delicate batters or dough, so I often revert to teaspoons, which is 5ml in every country, to avoid any surprises.Australian “plain flour” is equivalent to American “all purpose” while the UK’s “strong flour” is bread flour. Self-raising flour (“self-rising” in the US) exists in all three countries but differs in protein content and leavening. American self-rising flour is soft and light, perfect for their biscuits and pancakes, but less sturdy for cakes or scones. US “cake flour”, used to produce a soft, fine crumb in cakes, is not easy to come by in Australia and the UK, so techniques such as folding batter gently, so as not to overwork the gluten, is important.Caster sugar, the go-to for baking in Australia and the UK, is considered a specialist ingredient in the US where it is sold as “superfine sugar”. American bakers mostly use regular granulated sugar, so instructions to cream butter and sugar, especially for a light cake batter or pavlovas, can take longer.Cream can be a minefield. I remember making my favourite lemon loaf cake at a baking demo in the US and only realising too late that the “heavy cream” listed as the equivalent of UK double cream was thinner than what I usually use at home. The resulting cake was dense, heavy and lacking the rich, silky mouthfeel I expected. The difference may seem small, but as I discovered, fat content has a huge impact on the texture of baked goods.In the UK, all types of cream are readily available in supermarkets, but in Australia, double cream is usually a specialty item, sold only at select shops. I recently had an experience on Australian live television while assembling a cake sandwiched with whipped cream: the double cream called for in the recipe thickened into something almost like clotted cream after just a few turns of a hand whisk – I stopped just short of it turning into butter!View image in fullscreen‘The difference may seem small, but as I discovered, fat content has a huge impact on the texture of baked goods’: Helen Goh, pastry chef, author and recipe developer.Photograph: John DavidUK double cream (about 48% fat) is rich and whippable; single cream (about 18%) is pourable; clotted cream (55-60%) is spoonable. Australian thickened cream (about 35% fat, stabilised) and pure cream (about 35%) are versatile, while US heavy cream (36-40%) is closest to UK double cream.So, when converting recipes, it’s crucial to consider both fat content and stability. Sometimes that means adding a little mascarpone to American heavy cream to mimic the richness of UK double cream, or slightly diluting a very rich Australian premium double cream with cold milk and adjusting whipping speed or temperature to achieve the right consistency.Baking internationally can be confusing. But by understanding each country’s ingredients, you can more accurately translate recipes while preserving texture and flavour – and that home-baked goodness.View image in fullscreenFor children and adults alike: Helen Goh’s strawberry iced finger buns.Photograph: Laura Edwards/Murdoch BooksHelen Goh’s strawberry iced finger buns – recipeI sometimes buy finger buns from the supermarket, ostensibly for the kids, but the truth is I love them as much as they do. But while it’s joyous sinking your teeth into those pillowy soft buns on day one, there’s something slightly disturbing when they remain eversoft on days three or four. What is even in them? So I thought I’d have a go at making my own.Asking you to boil the milk and then let it cool might seem a bit crazy, but there’s method in the madness. Boiling the milk breaks down the proteins and results in a softer, more tender bread. It also makes the milk more effective in hydrating the flour, improving the texture of the dough. But make sure to cool the milk before mixing in the yeast – that’s essential to get the rise.Makes12For the milk bread150ml full-cream milk2 tsp active dried yeast30g caster sugar375g plain flour75ml water, boiling hot15g milk powder¾ tsp fine sea salt1 egg50g unsalted butter, cut into 1 cm pieces, then left to softenVegetable oil, for greasingFor the icing60g strawberries, hulled and roughly chopped300g icing sugar½ tsp vanilla bean paste20g liquid glucose(optional)To make the bread, put the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat. Set aside to cool to 38C (cool enough to touch) then whisk in the yeast and two teaspoons of the sugar. Let it stand to allow the yeast to activate and froth, about five minutes.Meanwhile, place 75g of the flour in a small heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling water over and mix with a spoon to form a stiff, shaggy paste. Cover the bowl and set aside to cool.Ten baking tips (and life lessons) from Australia’s best bakersRead morePut the remaining 300g of flour, the milk powder, salt and remaining 20g of sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer and stir with a whisk to combine. Add the flour and water paste, the yeast/milk mixture and the egg and mix with the dough hook on a low speed for about two minutes, until a scraggly dough forms.Add the butter, a little at a time, until incorporated. Increase the speed to medium and knead for about three minutes, until smooth. Scrape the dough out on to a clean work surface and knead gently for a couple of minutes, then shape into a ball and place in a lightly greased bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, around one to two hours, depending on the temperature of the room.Meanwhile, prepare a baking tin (approximately 35 × 25 cm measured across the base) by lining it with baking paper.When the dough has doubled in size, knock it down with your fist and turn it out on to a clean work surface. Cut it into 12 equal pieces, roughly 60g each. Taking one piece at a time, press the dough into a rough square approximately 10cm. Starting from the side closest to you, roll up into a small log, pinching and smoothing the ends and seam to seal, creating a little sausage. Repeat with the remaining pieces of dough, and place them 2cm apart on the lined baking tray.Cover the tray loosely with plastic wrap and leave in a warm place for 45 to 60 minutes, until doubled in size.When the buns are well risen, preheat the oven to 170C fan. Bake for about 18 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.View image in fullscreenTo make the icing, place all the ingredients in a food processor and blitz together until smooth. Drizzle over the tops of the cooled buns, and allow the icing to set before eating.This recipe is an edited extract from Baking & the Meaning of Lifeby Helen Goh, photography by Laura Edwards.

Not only were they an unexpected hit with my 18-month-old, but, after trying one myself, I instantly crossed out the saffron arancini at the top of my list for an upcoming lunch party and replaced it with a delirious, “OMG make these fritters!” Not bad for a five-ingredient dish, and a lot less faff than arancini.Beetroot, apple and feta frittersServe with a green salad and the dip alongside for a filling dinner on a cold evening.Prep15 minCook20 minServes2-42apples(I used Discovery)2 medium beetroot, peeled and grated1egg200g feta, crumbled60g self-raising flour(gluten-free if you have it)Olive oil,for fryingFor the dip3 heapedtbsp Greek yoghurt3 heapedtbsp mayonnaise½ lemon, juice and zestA pinch of sea saltGrate the apples skin and all into a clean tea towel, then twist and squeeze the towel over the sink to remove as much moisture as you can.

I scatter them, roughly chopped, over my morning yoghurt and fruit bowl, and when I feel an attack of the munchies coming on, I try (although I often fail) to reach for a handful of them in place of something sugary. These nutrient-dense superstars are high on the list of nutritionists’ favourite anti-inflammatory foods, and while all their health benefits are obviously terrific, I love them simply because they bring rich, buttery flavour, interest, and delightful texture to my cooking.Almond crusted chicken schnitzel (pictured top)Traditionally, schnitzels are coated in crisp breadcrumbs, but this delicious version using almonds and cornflour makes this nuttily delicious and suitable for anyone avoiding gluten.Prep5 minCook45 minServes44 small boneless, skinless chicken breasts50g parmesan, roughly chopped250g blanched almondsZest of1 lemon50gcornflourSea saltand black pepper2 eggs, lightly beaten1tbspdijon mustardLemon wedges, to servePut a chicken breast between two sheets of baking paper, then use a rolling pin to beat the chicken until it’s about 1.5cm thick all over.
