However, we also believe in shopping smarter, and there’s no denying that it’s often the best time of year to buy big-ticket items that you genuinely need and have planned to buy in advance, or stock up on regular buys such as skincare and cleaning products.Retailers often push offers that are not as good as they seem, with the intention of clearing out old stock, so we only recommend genuine deals. We assess the price history of every product where it’s available, and we won’t feature anything unless it is genuinely lower than its average price – and we will always specify this in our articles.We only recommend deals on products that we’ve tested or have been recommended by product experts. What we choose to feature is based on the best products at the best prices chosen by our editorially independent team, free of commercial influence.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The best Black Friday deals under £50: from £40-50The best-looking umbrellaView image in fullscreenOswin Hyde Joseph Handcrafted Umbrella, all colours now £49 (was £75)£49 at Debenhams£49 at BurtonLook and feel like a million dollars for less than fifty quid with this glorious Oswin Hyde brolly, correctly named “best-looking umbrella” in Pete Wise’s roundup of thebest umbrellasyou can buy.

As Ben Wilson explains in his four-starreview, this versatile game is a sim offline and a whole other beast online, where it’s purely an esport with shots and goals prioritised over defending.

Then, when I was less young, I thought it was to not have enough food, and now I am perfectly wise, I know that those things don’t matter at all, because you can always go to the shop. The important thing is not to look harried, and to not look that way, you need to not be that way.It’s a psychodynamically interesting thing, to invite people into your home: intimate and familial; generous – your friends will want to repay that by making you happy, and if you’re stressed instead, they’ll leave with an inchoate sense of guilt and discomfort. Every catering decision, guest list and to-do list should be made with this at the front of your mind: am I the kind of person who can put the finishing touches on a croquembouche and chat about Dolly Parton at the same time? Am I going to spend the whole night man-marking that friend who goes back a long way but now has some dicey views about 5G and Albanians? Do I absolutely need to clean the skirting boards?How to be a good guestSome absolute basics: you can be a bad guest even if you don’t go, by texting 20 minutes ahead and saying you can’t make it. Never do this. Cancel a week ahead, or apologise the next day. I read once that you should never arrive with flowers; send them earlier in the day. That sounds like the kind of thing posh people do, but it’s good not to arrive with something that immediately creates a task. Only bring flowers to someone you know well enough that you can find a vase and sort it yourself. I have a friend who arrives everywhere with a big bag of ice, which is weirdly useful and also, an icebreaker. You just go, “Look, ice!”I have another friend who arrives everywhere with a gigantic watermelon, and it’s hard to say how useful that is, but it’s also an ice-breaker. Don’t stick rigidly to other guests you know best – it creates cliques. Incorporate anyone standing alone, or if that’s you, gatecrash a clique. I have no prescription about what mood you should be in or what topics you should introduce. The chemical reaction between authentic selves is what the whole thing is supposed to be all about.Howto draw up a guest listThere’s a lot of subjectivity here: I have a friend who curates her guest lists incredibly carefully, pictures the room in her head like an Elizabethan masque, mentally pairing off friends who share a love of the Fall or whose mothers were both impossible in the same way. I also have friends who have a list of anchor guests, people without whom the party cannot occur, and all other invites will revolve around whether they are liked or disliked by the anchors, and all of that works – you can definitely engineer some fast friendships. I, by contrast, invite everyone in my phone, which throws up some surprises, like the vet. I had a party for the general election and invited the Ocado delivery guy (he came; he was fun).How to dressFor the general party, there is no rule, except – again – consistency. If you’re the kind of person (my brother) who would go to Buckingham Palace bare-chested in dungarees, then you’ll be comfortable whatever you’re wearing. But if you’re someone who feels nicety quite keenly, you should take multiple soundings ahead from everyone else you know who’s going – otherwise you’ll be embarrassed, and you won’t take a good time with you. If there’s any kind of theme, take it seriously: it’s your signal that you’re happy to be there, and grateful for the invitation. Unless everyone knows you’re a curmudgeon and they like you anyway, in which case, the dungarees are still fine.How to handle different dietary preferences and culturesI’m ashamed to say this, but it never naturally occurred to me – I had to be toldmultiple times –that people with allergies, intolerances, preferences and cultural requirements around food need to be accommodated more thoughtfully than just putting something out for them that they’re not allergic to. I’ve served bone marrow with a vegan at the table; I’ve handed a vegetarian a beer when I’ve just put out smoked salmon and not washed my hands; I’ve had aChristmasparty that was maybe 70:30 godless: Muslim, and everything on the buffet that was not made of pork sat directly next to something that was. Create separate areas if it’s a stand-up party; consider, if you have a lot of vegetarians, leaving meat out altogether. Whether it’s a preference or a blue-lights EpiPen emergency, people shouldn’t have to confront a thing they don’t like everywhere they look. These days I keep the voice of my vegan friend in my head: her mum used to try to serve her pasta and meatballs, with the meat just fished out, and she said, “If I cooked a stew of human fingers, and just removed the fingers, would you find that distasteful?”What’s in your brain larder?Nigella Lawson’s golden rule (one of about a million, all of them gold), was not to try out something new for the first time when you have a bunch of people round (see first principles: don’t get stressed). This will inevitably mean that there will be things you’ve made a hundred times, and you’ve done that because they’re easy and showstopping and delicious (I’ve been making aslow-roast lamb with feta, peppers and dillfrom Sainsbury’s magazine for 20 years now) but also, that you’re a bit bored by them. I have two friends who cater each other’s parties, a dazzling fix.Howto do placementBoy/girl/boy/girl is the kind of thing gen Z laughs at us for, because it’sso1950s. But if you don’t stick to it, it’s amazing how easily you can end up totally gender segregated, which makes for a weird table, asymmetrical levels of laughter, and everyone getting fomo. Always separate couples. Martha Stewart arranged a table to a pattern of threes – neutral, interesting, boring – because two boring people next to each other will create a cold zone that can spread, and two interesting people next to each other is a waste.How to drinkThis depends how old you are. In teenagehood, the foothills of binge drinking, getting drunk and incapable is mortifying, because it makes you look immature. By your 20s and 30s, it’s the handful of people who were lit up like a Christmas tree that made the evening memorable, and it’s fine if tonight that’s going to be you. By your 40s and 50s, realistically, being drunk isn’t going to make you do an interesting thing, like get off with your childhood sweetheart or set fire to a gazebo. It’s just going to make you tired and slow-witted, irascible and insensitive or repetitive and obsessional. So, however many drinks you have to stick to to avoid being any of those things, that’s how you should drink.Howto introduce people if you can’t remember their namesUgh, you know, an etiquette expert will say, “Just be frank, and say, ‘I’m so sorry, I’ve lost your name,’” but they don’t understand how mortifying it is when you’ve known someone 20 years and your brain has somehow voided this only bit of information about them that matters. I used to turn to the person I was introducing the forgeteeto, and say, “I’m so sorry, I’ve forgottenyourname,” hoping that would trigger a cacophony where everyone just said their own name at once. Then I got caught out horribly by someone saying, “How can you have forgotten Tim’s name? You’ve been best friends since 1996.” Now I just create diversions: “Didn’t you two meet that time we went to [insert weird activity, such as mudlarking or fireworks] in [insert a season or an area, not a year, which is too specific].” There will be a moment of confusion, and then they will say, “No, I wasn’t there. Hi, I’m Ben.”Howto deal with tricky peopleIt really depends on what kind of tricky; if they’re boring, you, as the host, have to rescue anyone they’ve cornered, and this is a whole-evening task, so you either have to put not-boring people on a rota for it or not invite them. Same if they’re a boor. A lot of people have a thing they do when they’re drunk – take their clothes off, start an argument, start crying, or break things – and you are absolutely fine to say, “You’re doing that thing you do when you’re drunk.” Even the most bellicose pisshead will take this rebuke in the spirit of fond acceptance.Howto leaveIt actually doesn’t matter, so long as you’re consistent. I have a friend who always does a French exit (slip off quietly before anyone’s noticed – also known, incomprehensibly, as the Irish goodbye) and nobody ever says, “Was Charlotte in a bad mood?” – whereas if I did that, people would think I’d been kidnapped. If you’re leaving first, don’t say, “Does anyone want to share an Uber?”, because you’ll clear the table; but if you’re leaving penultimately, definitely do say that, because there’s a good chance you should already have left. Don’t cue up for ages that you can’t stay long because of the babysitter or tomorrow’s early start or whatever – it casts a pall unnecessarily. Most important: once you’ve decided to leave, actually leave; don’t stand for ages in your coat, having one last conversation.Explore more on these topicsChristmasWinter food 2025Social etiquettefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The TV series was broadcast at prime time on both sides of the Atlantic, and ABC in the US even changed its name to ABeatlesC in its honour. The three accompanying albums (the first time the Beatles had allowed outtakes from their recording sessions to be officially released) sold in their millions. Its success helped kickstart the latterday Beatles industry, a steady stream of officially sanctioned documentaries, reissues, remixes, compilations and expanded editions, predicated on two ideas: that the Beatles’ archive contains fathomless bounty; and that the band’s story is so rich there’s no limit to the number of times it can fruitfully be retold in fresh light.For a while, those ideas seemed to hold true, but recently, it’s been hard not to think the Beatles’ Apple Corps might be trying to feed an insatiable appetite for content from an increasingly bare cupboard. You can marvel at the highlights of Peter Jackson’s TV series Get Back and still wonder whether the director wasn’t stretching his material a little thin; whether nearly eight hours of it – plus a separate Imax film of the Beatles’ final live performance on the roof of Apple’s London HQ,anda reissue ofthe original 1970 Let It Bedocumentary – might have been rather too much of a good thing.Last year’sMartin Scorsese-produced Beatles ’64, meanwhile, just re-edited familiar footage – much of it from the Maysles Brothers’ 1964 documentary, What’s Happening! The Beatles in the USA, reissued in 1991 as The First US Visit, then again by Apple in 2004 – and spliced it with new interviews that suggested everything that needed to be said about the events of 1964 had already been said, and the two surviving Beatles had run out of new angles on a subject they had been answering questions about for 60 years.A similar sense of pointlessness attends the new version of Anthology. It arrives with a fourth album of outtakes, but 23 of its 36 tracks have been previously released, which means vinyl buyers are being asked to cough up nearly 70 quid for 50 minutes of “new” music, most of which is pretty inconsequential to all but the most banzai Fabs devotee. There’sno sign of Carnival of Light, the near-mythic Stockhausen-influenced experiment the band recorded during the Sgt Pepper sessions, nor the fabled 27-minute version of Helter Skelter. Instead, you have to make do with a wobbly first take of their cover of Carl Perkins’ Matchbox.View image in fullscreenRock aristocracy … George Martin, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison in The Beatles Anthology.Photograph: PRThere’s also an “all-new” episode of the TV series, concentrating on the making of the original Anthology documentary and Free as a Bird and Real Love, the twoJohn Lennondemos the surviving members worked up into songs in the mid-90s. These events are now as far in the past as Beatlemania was when the Anthology series was produced: bizarrely, the footage from 30 years ago – a riot of ponytails, mullets, leather waistcoats and stonewashed denim – looks more dated than that from the 60s, the clothes sported by 90s rock aristocrats having yet to pass into the realm of classic style.The problem is, the new episode isn’t all-new at all. It’s essentially the bonus material from the 2003 DVD edition of Anthology padded out to 50 minutes: the three surviving Beatles being interviewed together at George Harrison’s home and at Abbey Road, loosely jamming old rock’n’roll songs – and an early McCartney effort, Thinking of Linking – on acoustic guitars and ukuleles; working on the new tracks at Paul McCartney’s home studio with producer Jeff Lynne; and sitting at a mixing desk while George Martin plays them multitrack recordings from the 60s.Some of the footage is sweet – there’s a lovely moment where Ringo addresses his bandmates with a plaintive “I like hanging out with you guys” – and some of it is oddly telling: you could divine a lot from George Harrison’s visible exasperation as the sessions for Free as a Bird and Real Love drag on. (Off camera, he famously refused to work on a third Lennon demo, Now and Then, deeming it “fucking rubbish”. McCartney and Starr eventually finished the track in 2023, 22 years after Harrison’s death.)McCartney has a funny story about getting Abbey Road’s recalcitrant engineers to keep working on Beatles sessions past their allotted hours by covertly dosing the studio’s tea urn with amphetamines. It’s nice to see them together and more or less happy, although you can’t miss a certain tension between Harrison and McCartney. When Martin plays the multitrack of the latter’s You Never Give Me Your Money, Harrison suggests it sounds “a bit cheesy”. McCartney is noticeably unamused.None of it is essential or particularly insightful. Like the Anthology 4 album, it’s been flammed together to suggest added value, that there’s something new to say about a subject that may well have been exhausted.The Beatles Anthology is on Disney+ now.

Six ways to connect with friends – even when busyIf you aren’t getting the quality time or intimacy you need, try these connection experiments to shake up interactionsElle HuntWed 26 Nov 2025 12.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 12.03 ESTShareLately, life has felt like Groundhog Day: work, gym, sleep, repeat. Between a punishing work schedule, the grim weather and my desire to hibernate, my social life has suffered. I feel dissatisfied, restless and isolated. But I have plenty of friends and active group chats – I can’t belonely, surely?Wrong!I have made a common error, according to Don Martin, content creator and host of the podcast Head on Fire. Even people with busy social lives can feel lonely if they aren’t getting the quality time or intimacy they need.Like me, Martin felt his needs weren’t being met. Researching the topic for his new audiobookWhere Did Everybody Go?, he found that loneliness is simply defined as the gap between the connection you want and the connection you’re getting.“You can feel lonely in a crowded room,” Martin points out.I’m terrible on the field. But my amateurism might actually have benefitsRead moreHaving realised this himself through the pandemic, Martin sought out new approaches to socialising – such as playing Animal Crossing with friends online – and shed other commitments in favour of more meaningful ones.“I’d confused being really busy with being socially fulfilled,” he says. Instead, we need to be proactive and flexible about our interactions.Inspired by Martin’s connection experiments, I tried six ways to shake up my interactions for two weeks.Send a voicenote instead of a text …I live alone and work from home. On a typical day, there are usually four or five WhatsApp threads active on my computer. They scratch the itch for collegial chat. Yet the half-hearted conversations and continual ping of messages can be more of a distraction than a source of connection.One morning, a friend texts, asking how my day is going. We’ve never done this before, but I reply with a (short!) voice note. She responds in kind, pointing out her status on WhatsApp: “no voice notes plz”. “But I will make an exception for you,” she adds magnanimously.It’s only a brief check-in, commiserating over punishing workloads, but hearing her voice is a definite boost – more personal and immediate than text.Or make a video callIn the pilot of Girls, Marnie Michaelsranksthe modes of communication, from least intimate (Facebook) to most (face-to-face). After my voice note success, I decide to ramp things up a notch – to themuch-malignedvideo call. I’m sure younger generations are happy FaceTiming away, but none of my friends indulge. Typically, my only video calls are with immediate family or professional Zooms.But I’m shaking up my social routines, so I spontaneously opt to video-call a friend. She picks up, with a confused “Hello?”Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, 'Well Actually', then 'Read more on living a good life in a complex world,' then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say 'More from this section'I don’t blame her – I’m not sure we’ve ever spoken on the phone. But we (and her cute dog) chat for about 20 minutes. When I hang up, I’m in a better mood, thanks to the face-to-face connection.Martin considers video-calling a better approximation of in-person connection than messaging. “Look somebody in the whites of their eyes,” he jokes. “Then you can start picking up on those non-verbal cues … It can be a much more fulfilling conversation, and it takes less time.”If you feel shy about initiating, make your friends call you, Martin suggests: “When you’ve been scrolling for three hours, and gotten lost down that rabbit hole – maybe that’s a time to text a friend and say, ‘Listen: call me right now.’”Set up a regular, standing planWhen I feel overwhelmed with work, it often doesn’t occur to me to socialise. This is when standing plans shine. Every Wednesday morning, I video chat with another friend who works from home in another city. I also play asocial football gameevery two weeks and attend a pub quiz monthly.There’s no effort involved, and I rarely feel like canceling, even at my busiest. I think of them as social scaffolding, load-bearing social routines that withstand even the most hostile schedules.It turns out Martin has something similar. Three or four times a week, he calls a close friend on his drive to work. These check-ins allow them to stay connected, since they only see each other in person a couple of times a month.View image in fullscreenDon Martin (left), content creator and host of the podcast Head on Fire.Composite: The Guardian/Don Martin“That regular connection with somebody makes whatever comes next a little easier to deal with … It also doesn’t take anything away from the time when we are together,” Martin says.To further reinforce my social scaffolding, I propose to another friend that we start a weekly Zoom in the new year. He replies enthusiastically: “Monday is good for me!”Carve out time to playOne of my favourite ways to spend time with friends is a boozy boardgame night. Unfortunately, few of my local friends share this interest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Socialising digitallycan be seen as inferiorto meeting up in person, but it’s often the only option. Plus it can be fun.“Where we get social media wrong is vilifying it as a whole,” says Martin. “The screen can be a fulfilling way to connect with people.”I feel my energy slipping one afternoon, so I text a friend to suggest we attempt the online version of my favourite boardgame,Codenames. Sure, there’s a bit of a learning curve, but also some of the same thrills as playing in person – and it’s definitely more restorative than my usual break activity (making a cup of tea and staring into the middle distance).Over the following week, I play Codenames with three different people. Some rounds are even nail-biters. (The popular board game Wavelength also hasa digital adaptation.)Send a “thinking-of-you” text …One of my friends has been juggling parenthood, a chest infection and an intense job. I try to let her know I’m thinking of her by sending the odd text or photo, with no expectation of a reply.“Consistency is great; constancy should not be a requirement for anybody,” Martin agrees. “It’s too much to put on someone.”More from Why am I like this:I’m an adult. Why do I regress under my parents’ roof?I like my own company. But do I spend too much time alone?People say you’ll know – but will I regret not having children?One Saturday morning, just as I’m about to grimly knuckle down to some work, a photo of a different friend at a mezcaleria in Oaxaca pops up on my phone, reminding me of our backpacking trip over a decade ago. I send her a screenshot and she replies, asking if I’m free for a call. Usually, a spontaneous phone call feels like an intrusion and sends me fleeing offline. This time I instantly call her back – and with video.We talk for about an hour, our longest conversation in over a year, during which time we’ve both become homeowners. We take each other on a virtual house tour, pointing out where the other will sleep on visits. It’s delightful. I eventually settle in at my computer in a much more optimistic, peaceable mood.…or ask to text lessWhile consistency is important, so is a sense of control, Martin discovered – not feeling like “a passive participant in your own life”, he says.This is why a steady stream of texts can sometimes feel more like a drain than a boost. We might be better off thinking through what we consider “quality time” and seeking that out.My most active text thread, with a man I have recently started seeing, pings morning to night. I don’t want to stop talking, and I’ve already eased him into voice notes. But I suggest that instead of laboriously tapping out every relevant story from our pasts, we save them up for when we next meet.Fortunately, he’s not put off by my reference to an “agenda”. At the pub the following week, we get through most of our list – so much more enjoyable than the glancing treatment the anecdotes would have received over text. We’ve already started another agenda for our next meeting.After two weeks of experimenting, I’m struck by how much I’ve enjoyed it – and how willing my friends have been to join in. Maybe everyone is seeking new ways to stay in touch amid busy lives.There is no one-size-fits-all approach to staving off loneliness, Martin says. “What worked for you last year, last week, might not work for you now.”We also have more agency than we might think. Martin characterises it as putting together a “toolkit, rather than a map”. We could all benefit from being more proactive in our friendships, just as we’re encouraged to do in romantic relationships: for instance, explaining how much connection we need and how we prefer to communicate, he says.With that said, my friends can expect more video calls from now on.Where Did Everybody Go?by Don Martin is available wherever audiobooks are soldExplore more on these topicsWell actuallyWhy am I like this?FriendshipfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But equally interesting is the leaked material itself and where it may have come from.Thestory covers two intercepted phone calls: one between Witkoff and top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, and another between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev,who has been deeply involved in negotiationswith the Trump White House.Bloomberg’s story was published without any byline or dateline, presumably because noting where the story was written or who wrote it could give clues as to the identity of the source. Bloombergsaysonly that it has “reviewed and transcribed audio” of the two phone calls, without giving any hint as to the sourcing or any checks done to verify authenticity.Given the agency’s reputation for rigorous reporting however, it can be assumed that the source was considered to be very trustworthy before a decision was made to publish.Ushakov, who was on both of the calls, appeared to confirm the authenticity of the recordings on Wednesday: although he claimed some of it was “fake”, he said he would not comment on the rest because the calls were confidential, and said leaking such discussions is “of course unacceptable”.In an interview with the newspaper Kommersant, Ushakov said some of his conversations were conducted on encrypted government channels, but suggested the calls with Dmitriev and Witkoff may have been made over WhatsApp. “There are certain conversations on WhatsApp that, generally speaking, someone might somehow be able to listen to,” he said.The content of the calls provides proof of what many already suspected about Witkoff’s closeness to the Russian position in negotiations. The question of who took the highly unusual step of leaking such sensitive audio to a news agency is more complicated.“It’s really hard to speculate. It could be 100m different things, including somebody on the Russian side trying to hurt Witkoff’s reputation,” said Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief.Trump envoy Witkoff reportedly advised Kremlin official on Ukraine peace dealRead moreRussian intelligence agencies have a long pedigree ofintercepting and releasing sensitive political calls, but there is no obvious motive for Moscow to have compromised Ushakov, a key aide to Vladimir Putin, and Witkoff, Russia’s friendliest interlocutor in the Trump administration. However, givenreportsof splits in the Kremlin elite over who manages relations with the US, nothing can be ruled out.Ukraine may have the motive to make the call public – Kyiv is extremely uneasy with Witkoff’s role in negotiations and would be keen to undermine his position, as well as publicise the shocking extent of collaboration between the Kremlin and the White House adviser. But the risk of a catastrophic bust-up with the Americans if caught would probably give Ukrainian officials pause for thought, and it would also be an impressive technical coup for Ukrainian agencies to be able to monitor a WhatsApp call that took place outside Ukrainian territory.One senior former intelligence official said that while any number of agencies could have intercepted the call, the most likely source was someone inside the US system.“There are different ways of intercepting calls, including traditional signals intelligence methods, cyber-attacks, and having access to the devices, so anything is theoretically possible, but my strong suspicion is that this came from the US side, and if that’s the case, you have two entities who are capable of doing this, the CIA and the NSA,” said the official.There are many people inside US intelligence agencies unhappy with the current administration and its policies on Ukraine and Russia, but leaking audio of the call would be a difficult and potentially extremely dangerous move for any disgruntled employee.One notable detail is that Bloomberg obtained audio of the recording, rather than just a transcript or report of the call, suggesting the source was either directly involved in intelligence collection or senior enough to obtain the raw audio. Another former intelligence official suggested a European intelligence service horrified at Witkoff’s pro-Russian position was most likely to be behind the leak.What makes the publication so surprising is that, if the interception of Ushakov’s calls was part of a longstanding penetration, releasing the information would probably cause him to change his device and communication habits, and thus would close down a fruitful intelligence window for whichever agency had obtained it.“It’s completely unsurprising that any number of agencies might have got hold of this recording, but it’s extremely surprising that someone would leak it,” said one of the former officials.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsRussiaUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

We did Elephant Stone and they were lovely. Then as Manchester turned into Madchester I got to know them really well. I went to the great gig they did in Blackpool; I went to Spike Island. It was a fantastic time to be together and the Haçienda was the glue. There was no VIP area in the club, so punters would walk around and think: “There’s Mani!”View image in fullscreenPeter Hook.Photograph: Bass Guitar Magazine/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesI had the Roses in my Suite 16 studio doing demos for what was going to be the second album, until they scrapped it. I got to know Mani and his wife, Imelda. We had a wild period. Then after our various bands stopped playing live we startedFreebass, with three bass players: myself, Mani and Andy Rourke, who’d been in the Smiths. The band was ill-fated – too many chefs – and eventually we fell out badly after a row over a gig.Mani slagged me offbut God bless him, the very next day he phoned me up andapologised. That was Mani. Once we were no longer working together, we became friends and after that every day spent with him was a total pleasure.When people say Mani could be a clown or joker, it isn’t the right word. Yes, he was very entertaining. He was a man of the people, very funny and very irreverent. But he also had an intensity and didn’t suffer fools gladly. He was very passionate about things he believed in, whether Man United or standing up for his mates. If he felt something was wrong, or there was some sort of injustice, he was very tenacious. Once you had Mani on your side, you were rocking. He was a fighter and never gave an inch but he was everybody’s friend and nobody had a bad word about him.When the Roses reformed, he was desperate for it to be like it was at the start – it broke his heart when it wasn’tWhen he was on form, he was a wonderful soul. He’d been too young to be a mod so always had a thing about scooters. One day he came to my house with one of those “human cannonball” crash helmets on and looked like Crazy Frog. An hour later I heard this strange noise and it was Mani, kicking his flooded scooter, because it was a wet day and the moisture had got in the engine. He must have kicked that scooter for an hour and a half but then, incredibly, it started. That’s the magic of the man: he never let anything beat him.From a bass-playing point of view, he was the best. Everybody wanted to be him. Mani joining the Stone Roses made the difference. He was a groove artist and into groovy music. I recently watched him playing Fool’s Gold on Instagram and thought: “How is he playing that?” Like Andy Rourke, Mani played very melodically – which I do, but Mani was much subtler. I always tried to compete with the guitar but Mani wove around it. That’s a great skill, but I didn’t care what he played. He could have banged the thing on the floor for all I care: he was Mani.He was in two of the coolest bands of all time: the Stone Roses andPrimal Scream. I actually auditioned for the Primals and they said I was too much like New Order, so when Mani got the job he was straight on the phone to me. “Hey No 2” – he always called me No 2 – “it’s No 1 here.” Rourkey was “No 3”: the level of banter between the three of us was amazing.View image in fullscreen‘The music he DJ’d reflected his bass playing’ … Mani DJing in 2003.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesAll Mani wanted to do was play and most of all he loved playing to people. When the Roses reformed, he was desperate for it to be like it was at the start and it broke his heart when it wasn’t. But it was nice after all they’d been through, financially and otherwise, that they got that final payday that enabled him and Imelda to have a lovely life. Once they got their boys, they were absolutely made up. They were a great little family.Mani’s writhing, relentless bass was the Stone Roses’ secret sauce – it taught indie kids how to dance | Alexis PetridisRead moreWhen he was no longer playing, he started DJing and the music he played reflected his bass playing: funk and soul. He never stopped working and was so looking forward to the speaking tour he’d just announced. It’s heartbreaking that he’s gone before it started and my heart breaks for those two boys, losing both their parents so soon after each other.The outpouring of grief and sadness when Mani died has been really quite remarkable. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it, for a pop star, certainly not for a long time. At the moment every Manchester legend is asking themselves “Will I get that when I die?” But I can safely say that Mani will never be forgotten.As told to Dave SimpsonExplore more on these topicsMusicStone RosesPrimal ScreamPeter HookfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The OBR said the threshold freeze would bring an additional 780,000 people into paying the basic rate of income tax; 920,000 into paying the higher rate; and another 4,000 would pay the additional rate.Budget 2025: key points at a glanceRead moreIn a series of well-trailed measures, the chancellor targeted the rich via a new council tax surcharge for properties worth more than £2m and announced a 2p tax increase on income from dividends, savings and property. Contributions to “salary sacrifice” pension schemes, on which employers pay no national insurance, will be capped at £2,000 from 2029 – bringing in a significant £4.7bn a year.Reeves later told journalists that she did not believe she had broken the Labour manifesto with the threshold freeze. “If you read the manifesto, we are very clear, we say ‘the rates of income tax, NI and VAT’, but if you are asking does this have a cost for working people, I acknowledge it does,” she said.The OBR said the tax squeeze would hit living standards, with real disposable household income scheduled to rise by just 0.25% a year over the forecast period – weaker than it expected in March..Financial markets responded positively as Reeves more than doubled the financial buffer she has left against her fiscal rules to £21.7bn, from less than £10bn in her spring statement.Yields on 10-year government bonds, or gilts, which move in the opposite direction to prices, were down 0.07 percentage points at 4.41% by late on Wednesday, lowering the cost of government borrowing..Labour MPs hailed the chancellor’s decision to spend £3bn a year on scrapping the controversial two-child benefit limit in full, a move the government said would lift 450,000 children out of poverty.“I don’t intend to preside over a status quo that punishes children for the circumstances of their birth,” the chancellor said to cheers from the Labour backbenches.Reeves also promised to bear down on inflation with a package of cost-of-living measures, including removing green subsidies from household energy bills and freezing rail fares.Levies on energy bills will now be paid out of general taxation, which the Treasury said could reduce bills by an average of £150 a year from next April.Labour MPs and ministers praised the budget as a shift leftwards – saying it had bought Keir Starmer and Reeves time from a much-rumoured leadership challenge.“This shows we are a full-blooded Labour government. In an ideal world we would have wanted welfare to come first but we are where we are. People want us to make an argument – so this is one. Wealthiest pay more and we protect those with greatest need,” one senior strategist said.But several others said the OBR showed the fundamental weakness in the economy remained – and that the deep reservations about Starmer’s leadership would not be calmed by this budget. “This does nothing to move the fundamentals,” one minister said. “Yet again there was an opportunity for boldness which has led to nothing much.”Another minister said: “This buys them a few months with backbenches and bond markets and it further cements hatred with my voters. But it delays the now inevitable reckoning.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was responding to weaker economic forecasts from the OBR, which now expects average GDP growth of 1.5% over the next five years – 0.3% slower than previously expected..Alongside the threshold freeze and the mansion tax, other revenue raisers announced by Reeves included a £1.1bn increase in tax on online gambling and a 3p-a-mile levy on electric vehicles. Rishi Sunak’s 5p cut to fuel duty was extended to next summer, but it will start to rise from next September.Gilt yields began falling even before Reeves stood up in the House of Commons, as traders digested the OBR’s budget document, mistakenly published on the watchdog’s website about 40 minutes before she was due to begin speaking.Jonas Goltermann, the deputy chief markets economist at CapitalEconomics, said: “The gilt market is breathing a sigh of relief after the much-anticipated UK budget announcement today delivered less bad news than feared and the chancellor appears to have, so far, come out of a fraught fiscal process a bit stronger.”Some analysts highlightedthe heavily backloaded natureof Reeves’s plans, however, with borrowing set to be higher over the next three years, and the bulk of the tax rises scheduled for the end of the parliament, to ensure she can meet her fiscal rule of covering day-to-day spending with taxes..“To bear down on borrowing in later years and deliver that increase in ‘headroom’, the chancellor is relying heavily on tax rises towards the back end of the parliament,” said Helen Miller, the director of theInstitute for Fiscal Studies(IFS). “More borrowing for the next few years, then a sharp adjustment. Spend now, pay later.“It’s one thing to promise a reduction in borrowing, and another to actually deliver it.”Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, welcomed the moves on cutting the cost of living but echoed the IFS’s caution. “This budget leaves much of the fiscal repair job to 2028 and beyond. Economic winds could change dramatically between now and then. The chancellor has taken the sensible step to increase her wiggle room at the start of the parliament but the effects will be felt at the end,” she said.Reeves addressed MPs in parliament on Wednesday night warning them that they would see a negative response on the newspaper front pages – but telling them it was up to them to sell the budget to voters.“Now, we’ve got to win the argument, and we’ve got to win the argument every single day. We have to win the argument for the budget. We’ve got to campaign on the budget – and that is what we must now do,” she said.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, dismissed Reeves’ statement as a “Benefits Street budget,” accusing her of “making ordinary people pay for her incompetence and her inability to face down Labour’s tax-hungry leftwing backbenchers”.Soft-left MPs said it was a victory for those who had spent time since the welfare rebellion pushing the party leftwards. The revived Tribune group of MPs, likely to be a vehicle for any future leadership battle for a leftwing candidate, praised the chancellor, calling it a “Labour budget, demonstrating Labour values”.But in a warning shot it said the budget should be “the start of a wider programme of modernisation. Future tax reforms must aim for simplicity, sustainability, and fairness – ensuring that hard work is rewarded, unearned income and wealth are taxed more consistently, and those with the broadest shoulders should continue to contribute proportionately to national renewal.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityBenefitsEnergy billsPublic financeUS Government borrowingnewsShareReuse this content"

She once again refers to the £22bn “black hole” in the public finances left by the Conservatives, saying that taxes on the wealthiest have helped close the gap and fund the NHS.She criticises opponents who think the only good thing the state can do is “get out of the way”.“Working people demanded and deserved change,” she says. “I said there would be no return to austerity and I meant it … I said I would cut the cost of living and I meant it … I said I would cut debt and borrowing and I meant it.”Rowena Mason,Whitehall editor:Reeves has mounted a defence of her approach of sticking to her fiscal rules, and opting squarely for tax rises rather than spending cuts to balance the books.Income tax and national insuranceIncome tax and national insurance thresholds will befrozen for another three yearsfrom 2028, continuing a freeze implemented by the previous government. This will bring more people into higher tax bands.Reeves admits this decision will “affect working people” but says changes to the tax system will ensure the wealthiest contribute the most.Headline rates of income tax, VAT and national insurance will not go up, which Reeves says means Labour has kept its manifesto pledge not to raise taxes on working people.RM:A three-year freeze on income tax thresholds is slightly longer than was expected and is the single biggest tax-raising measure in the budget. It is considered a “stealth tax” measure as it is less noticeable and controversial than an increase in the headline rate of income tax, but millions of people will pay more tax as they are dragged into higher bands.LiveTax, pensions and energy bills: How the 2025 budget could affect you – videoProperty and council taxThe basic and higher rates of tax on property, dividend and savings incomewill go up by two percentage points each.From April 2028 there will be a high-value council tax surcharge – AKA the “mansion tax” – for properties worth more than £2m, of £2,500 a year, rising to £7,500 for properties worth more than £5m.RM:The changes to council tax will satisfy Labour MPs– and some unions– who have long been pushing for a mansion tax. However, it does not appear to be a huge revenue raiser, so some may think it should have gone further. There is some potential for gripes about the surcharge where it may distort the property market around the £2m mark– but it is much less likely to cause a headache for the chancellor than a full revaluation of the council tax system. The chancellor also set the cap at £2m rather than the original plan for a lower tax limit, to avoid upsetting voters in London, where house prices are higher than the rest of the country.PensionsFrom April 2029, there will be a £2,000 cap on the amount that can be put into a pension and shielded from national insurance contributions through salary sacrifice. Contributions above that level will be taxed in the same way as other employee pension contributions.Removing tax benefits from salary-sacrifice pension schemes is forecast to raise £4.7bn in extra national insurance contributions, the OBR says.RM:This is a huge revenue raiser and chancellors have traditionally shied away from it, fearing a backlash. However, there is a fairness argument that can be applied to the idea of puttingnationalinsurance on pension contributions, as pensioners do not pay it in the same way that they pay income tax. It will not hugely affect those earning lower and middle wages, but experts say it may affect behaviour of higher earners andmean their cash is spread into other investments instead, if the tax benefits are less obvious.Isa reformFrom 6 April 2027 the annual Isa cash limit will be set at £12,000, down from £20,000. The government will publish a consultation in early 2026 on the implementation of a new, simpler Isa product to support first time buyers to buy a home.RM:This is a blow for saversbut people will still be able to invest up to £20,000 in a stocks and sharesIsa. Those over 65 have also been exempted from the changes, as the government continues to woo pensioners inan attempt to neutralise the hostility created byits decision to scrap the winter fuel allowance – before partlyU-turning.Energy billsThe energy company obligation (ECO) scheme – a home insulation scheme – introduced by the Conservatives will be scrapped, Reeves says.She says £150 will come off bills next year as a result.RM:This is a flagship measure to help people with the cost of living that the government will hopepeople actually notice on their energy bills– without it being offset by rises in the cost of fuel. The main criticism will be that theECO scheme helped low-income households insulate their homes– which is the best way of bringing down bills in the long term.Two-child benefit limit“The biggest barrier to equal opportunity is child poverty,” says Reeves, as sheabolishes the two-child limitfor universal credit and tax credit, costing the Treasury £3bn by 2029-30.RM:This part of the budget has got the loudest cheers from Labour MPs. Reeves and Keir Starmer had held out against lifting the limit, believing it was not affordable– and even removed the whip from MPs who voted to get rid of it. It means their decision to lift it now has huge political symbolism, showing that Reeves is taking a measure in keeping with Labour values to tackle child poverty– helping 450,000 children and worth £5450 to low-income families. While Labour will be ecstatic that the hated cap is gone, the Conservatives will go on the attack over the decision, saying it is a sign that Reeves is increasing spending on welfare at a time when she is raising taxes on workersNational minimum wageThe minimum wage for 18- to 20-year-olds will go up from £10 to £10.85 an hour from April, while the national living wage will go up from £12.21 to £12.71 an hour.RM:A boost for low-paid workers is another measure to help people with the cost of living. It will also help increase income tax take, and willput pressure on companies in sectors such as hospitality and care.Milkshake taxDairy-based drinks such as milkshakes and canned lattesare being added to the sugar tax. The levy will also be tougher overall, with the threshold for its application cut from 5g for each 100ml to 4.5g.RM:The extension of the levy is a sign the government and health experts think this tax is working. It is targeted at stopping young people in particular getting hooked on sugary drinks that contribute to obesity and tooth decay. Critics of “sin taxes” will always say they erode personal choice and responsibility, but there are no signs that they are widely unpopular with the public.Fuel dutyFuel dutyhas once again been frozen, for another five months at least, until September 2026. The rate has been frozen since 2010-11. It will go up with inflation after that, ending 15 years of freezes.RM:Fuel duty has long appeared to be the politically impossible tax to raise, despite the effects of fossil fuels on the environment. It has been frozen for more than a decade after campaigning by motorists’ groups and newspapers such as the Sun. Reeves’s focus on the cost of living means that will continue for another five months– but it ispoised to rise after that. There is still scope for Reeves to cancel that rise at the spring statement, but this could be the start of the process by which it finally goes up.Electric vehiclesAs expected, there will be new excise duty on electric cars, payable alongside vehicle excise duty,at 3p a milefor electric cars and 1.5p for plug-in hybrids, to help double funding for road maintenance in England.RM:The small print from the Office for Budget Responsibilitysuggests that this will discourage electric car take-up. However, it will eventually raise about £1.9bn a year– and work towards solving the long-term problem of lower receipts from fuel duty as the UK moves towards greener vehicles.Schools and the NHSRepeating what was in the spending review, Reeves refers to an extra £5m for secondary school libraries and £18m to upgrade playgrounds.She promises that a saving of £4.9bn from a variety of efficiencies will be spent on more nurses and GP appointments, together with £300m of investment in tech to improve patient services and 250 new local patient health centres.RM:Reeves has not talked much about what her£26bn of tax riseswill be spent on– aside from increasing headroom. But the government is investing more in public services from the NHS to schools as set out in the spending review, and the chancellor is very clear that the age of austerity is over.Welfare and apprenticeshipsReeves claims 15,000 people will get back into work, a figure confirmed today, due to reforms to universal credit.About £300m of taxpayer subsidies will be removed for those using their disability benefits to drive Motability vehicles – including imposing VAT on payments for higher-value cars and ending relief from insurance premium tax.There will be funding to make sure that apprenticeships are free for small and medium-sized enterprises.RM:Reeves has shied away from making deep cuts to the welfare bill after an outcry from Labour MPs. The proposed end to tax breaks to the Motablity scheme have the potential to cause a further backlash among Labour MPs and disability groups as it will make it more expensive for disabled people to access the scheme.Tobacco and alcohol dutyNothing new here, as tobacco continues to rise at two percentage points above the retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation, while alcohol goes up in line with RPI.RM:Putting up taxes on harmful products each year is essential for the chancellor, as falling consumption of tobacco in particular shows revenue going down every year.Growth and inflation forecastsThe Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) – in a document released early in what appears to have been an extraordinary blunder – has predicted growth of 1.5% for this year, up from the 1% it predicted in March. After that, the forecast is for 1.4% growth next year and 1.5% every year thereafter until 2030. That means that every year from 2026 has been downgraded. Previously, forecasts were for 1.9% in 2026, then hovering between 1.7% and 1.8%.Inflation appears to be running very slightly hotter than predicted in March, coming in at 3.5% this year compared with a forecast of 3.2%, then 2.5% in 2026 (up from 2.1%). Thereafter it is as you were, at 2% every year.RM:The growth figures for this year are relatively positive for the chancellor, who fought the election on the basis that Labour would improve national prosperity. However, the years after that are looking worse than expected. Reeves gets round this by saying she expects to beat the forecasts in future.On top of that, the inflation figures will be a worry, as voters are very concerned about the cost of living and rising prices are a very obvious way in which they feel a squeeze on their household finances in daily life. Reeves has repeatedly said she will tackle inflation but the budget does not appear to have many measures to grip this.Government borrowingBorrowing in 2025-26 is predicted to be £138.3bn, falling to £112.1bn the year after, then £98.5bn in 2027-28, £86.9bn in 2028-29, £67.9bn in 2029-30 and £67.2bn in 2030-31. That means borrowing is slightly higher next year, but it is predicted to be lower than forecast in March by the end of the period, in 2030.Reeves says that according to the IMF the UK will reduce borrowing more over the rest of this parliament than any other G7 economy. She says the government finances will reach a surplus of £3.9bn in 2029, £21.7bn the year after and £24.6bn the year after that.RM:Reeves has made reducing borrowing a priority to bring down the amount of debt interest being paid, and debt to GDP will fall in every year of the forecast. In keeping with her insistence that she will stick to her financial rules, the chancellor has resisted the calls of those within her party who think she should be borrowing more to invest– in defiance of the jitters of financial markets.Gambling dutyFrom April 2026, remote gaming duty, levied on online casinos,will rise from 21% to 40%. Bingo duty of 10% is abolished.There will be a new online-only rate of general betting duty, which is levied on operators’ income from sports betting. High street bookies will still pay the current rate of 15% but for online, the duty will rise to 25%, with a carve-out for horse racing. Casino gaming duty bands will be frozen.Reeves says the measures will raise more than £1bn a year by 2031.Devolution and regionsThere will be £13bn of “flexible funding” for seven mayors to invest in skills, business support and infrastructure.An additional £370m for the Northern Ireland Executive, £505m for the Welsh government and £820m for the Scottish government.Wales will be the host for two “AI growth zones”, creating more than 8,000 jobs, supported by a £10m investment in the semiconductor sector.In Scotland, there will be £14m for low-carbon technologies in Grangemouth, £20m to renew infrastructure in Inverclyde and £20m to redevelop Kirkcaldy town centre and seafront.RM:Labour is facing difficult elections next year inWales, where it is threatened by Plaid Cymru and Reform, and in Scotland against the SNP. Reeves devotes quite a long passage in her speech to how the government is spending more inScotland and Wales, where she flags new AI zones bringing jobs.Energy and North SeaReeves promises to cut red tape holding back investment in nuclear power investment, based on a report by John Fingleton.Alongside the budget the government published its North Sea future plan, whereby new offshore fossil fuel projects will be able to move aheadas long as they are linked to existing fields.RM:The push for nuclear energy does seem finally to have some new vigour under Ed Miliband as energy secretary but it has suffered years of delay and indecision that make it hard to take promises of red tape being slashed seriously.Business taxesThere will be an expansion of entrepreneurial investment schemes and there will be a three-year stamp duty holiday on the purchase of shares in companies newly listed in the UK.Reeves is also launching a consultation on how to attract more entrepreneurs. “If you build here, Britain will back you,” she says.There will be a 40% allowance to allow businesses to write off more of their upfront investment costs.There will be permanently lowered business rates for 750,000 retail, hospitality and leisure businesses, paid for higher rates on properties worth more than £500,000, used by “warehouse giants”. There will be £4.3bn of support for properties that receive a large increase in their bill.Customs duty will apply to parcels of any value, to stop online retailers undercutting high street retailers on price.Other measuresReeves reiterated the previously announced freezein rail faresand prescription charges.The chancellor will exempt payments from the compensation scheme for the infected blood scandal from inheritance tax.Capital gains tax relief on shares sold by business owners will be cut in half. The decision to restrict employee ownership trust capital gains tax relief from 100% to 50% comes because the scheme is on course to cost £20bn, 20 times the original estimate.Closing remarks“Choices” is the theme of Reeves’s speech. As she closes she refers to “my choices: not austerity, not reckless borrowing, but cutting tax, cutting waiting lists and cutting the cost of living. Those are Labour choices, promised and delivered by this budget promised and delivered by this Labour government”.RM:Reeves will be breathing her biggest sigh of relief that thebond markets have not reacted badly to her budget, meaning no jump in the cost of government borrowing. Her second confidence boost will come from Labour MPs, who were extremely happy about the end to the two-childlimit for universal credit, which kept children in poverty. Asfor the wider public, many voters may be relieved that there was no income tax rise and only the wealthiest will be affected by the mansion tax, whilelower energy bills will also be good news for households. Given the measures were less drastic than first briefed, it remains to be seen whether the Conservative attacks on the chancellor for the overall £26bn package of tax increases while raising benefits will have much cut-through.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025EconomicsRachel ReevesTaxnewsShareReuse this content"

He is paid thenational living wage (NLW)of £12.21 for workers aged 21 and over. He pays £1,930 in income tax and £772 in national insurance (NI) contributions. This results in a monthly take-home pay of £1,627 after tax, or £19,520 a year. On 1 April 2026 the NLW rate will increase 50p – 4.1% – to £12.71 an hour. His annual income tax bill will rise to £2,112 and NI to £845, leaving him with £1,681 a month, an increase of £54.SingleAverage earnerView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerAmir is earning the UK’s typical (median) wage of £38,000 in his marketing job. He pays £5,086 a year in income tax and NI of £2,034. His monthly take-home pay is £2,573, or £30,880 a year. With no changes to “big three” – income tax, national insurance and VAT – not a lot will be different in 2026. Traditionally income tax bands keep pace with inflation, but they will remain frozen until 2031. This means a greater proportion of pay is taxed than would otherwise be expected. He will benefit from the average £150 cut to energy bills promised and one-year freeze on regulated rail fares.Couple, two childrenBoth working, one high earnerView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerTash is a management consultant earning £63,000, while Mo earns £28,000 as a part-time teacher. Tash pays £3,000 a year into her pension using her company’s salary sacrifice scheme, which enables her to retain her child benefit entitlement and save on NI. After tax they have a combined monthly income of £5,941. However, from 2029 there will be a cap of £2,000 on pension contributions through salary sacrifice schemes and, at current NI rates, paying in £3,000 will cost her an extra £20.Couple, two childrenBoth working, the higher earner is a small business ownerView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerJim owns a building company and pays himself by drawing a salary up to the NI threshold of £12,570 and taking £85,000 in dividends on top. Lily earns £25,000 as an office administrator. Their combined annual income tax and NI bill is £24,950, leaving £8,135 a month to live on. However, the increased rates of dividend income tax from 2026 mean their annual bill will increase by £1,690. This leaves them £7,994 a month.Single parentSole incomeView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerJessica earns £50,000 as an accounts manager. She receives £26.05 a week child benefit for her son, totalling £1,355 a year. Her annual income tax bill is £7,486 and £2,994 for NI, leaving her with monthly take-home pay of £3,406. The frozen thresholds mean any pay rise will lead to her becoming a higher-rate taxpayer (the 40% ratekicks in at £50,271). Her child benefit payments will increase and she will also bank the promised energy bill savings.Low income familyOne income plus universal creditView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerThe Smith family have three children and live in a rented flat in the Midlands. Jack works 35 hours a week in a distribution centre and is paid the NLW. His partner Mia isn’t working. After tax and NI his take-home pay is £1,627 a month. This is topped up with a monthly universal credit and child benefit payment totalling £1,457.Under the two-child cap parents could only claim universal credit or tax credits for their first two children. The decision to abolish this rule , and the uprating of benefits, mean the family should be able to claim £304 a month for their third child. They will also benefit from the 2026 uplift in the NLW.Senior managerOne income, approaching retirementView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerJane is keen to retire and, with her mortgage paid off, has been using her company’s salary sacrifice scheme to pay £20,000 a year into her pension pot. Saving for her retirement this way results in a combined annual income tax and NI bill of £25,143, which leaves this higher-rate taxpayer £6,655 a month to live on. She is affected by the new cap on salary sacrifice contributions from April 2029. If she continues to save this way the new restrictions will mean paying an extra £360 in NI each year.CoupleTwo incomes, saving to buy a houseView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerWith one partner earning £55,000 and the other on £51,360, the freeze on tax thresholds means that although their take home-pay is not affected by the budget in real terms, their purchasing power is falling. These renters are saving up to buy their first home and both have been putting their spare cash into cash Isas. However, as part of a drive to get people to invest in the stock market the amount that can be saved in a cash Isa is being reduced from £20,000 to £12,000 a year for under-65s in April 2027. The couple are worried their rent might go up if their landlord looks to pass on higher income tax on rental income when the rates increase in 2027.Low income pensionerNew state pensionerView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerGeorge’sbasic state pensionis worth £241 a week, £963 a month or £11,550 a year. He qualifies for £200 winter fuel payment. Next year, under the“triple lock”policy, the basic and new state pension payments will go up by 4.8% to £184.92 and £241.30 a week respectively. However, Age UK warns the decision to freeze the income tax personal allowance for another three years will drag more older people into paying income tax, including some on low and modest incomes (the government has pledged to ease the administrative burden for pensioners whose sole income is the state pension).Affluent pensionersRetired couple with private pensionsView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerBrian and Joan receive the new state pensions alongside their respective retirement pots, resulting in a combined income of £60,000. Their annual income tax bill is £6,972, leaving them with £4,419 a month to spend. From April 2026 they will receive the state pension increase worth £1,150 a year to the couple, adding £230 to their income tax bill. The pair own a £2m home in a leafy London suburb so face paying the new “mansion tax” – AKA the high value council tax surcharge – of £2,500 from 2028.DriverElectric car ownerView image in fullscreenIllustration: Leon EdlerThe chancellor announced a new tax for electric and hybrid car drivers. From April 2028, electric car drivers will pay a road charge of 3p a mile, while plug-in hybrid drivers will pay 1.5p a mile, with the rates going up each year with inflation. The tax is expected to add up to about £255 a year for the average EV driver, according to the online platform Carwow. Meanwhile, the decision to keep the 5p fuel duty cut in place until September 2026 results in a saving of more than £3 a tank for drivers of petrol and diesel cars.Figures rounded to the nearestpoundTax and national insurance calculations provided by accountantsBlick RothenbergBenefits calculations byChild Poverty Action GroupExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025TaxPensionsEconomicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The yield – in effect the interest rate – on 10-year UK government bonds initially dropped by four basis points, while the pound jumped by 0.3% on the news that the chancellor had built a significantly larger than anticipated fiscal buffer.View image in fullscreenRichard Hughes, the OBR chair.Photograph: Charlie J Ercilla/AlamyWhen asked about the leak, the OBR first suggested that any issue lay elsewhere. But within minutes, Downing Street realised the independent watchdog had uploaded its critical economic and fiscal outlook report – the key document that rules on the budget – well ahead of time.In the moments before her speech, the chancellor was seen checking her phone as the news broke. Treasury minister Torsten Bell, sat behind Reeves, passed his phone down and MPs hurriedly shuffled handwritten notes along the frontbench.By the time Reeves took to the dispatch box at 12.35pm, the OBR had been forced into issuing a humbling apology and had launched an internal investigation.Details of the budget are supposed to be a closely held secret until the chancellor announces them to MPs in the Commons. However, high-profile breaches have happened several times before, in an increasingly leaky process.Budget 2025 calculator: find out if you are better or worse offRead moreMost recently,the London Evening Standard tweeted an image of its front page revealing the main announcements of George Osborne’s 2013 budgetbefore the then chancellor was due to speak. In 1996, the then Daily Mirror editor, Piers Morgan, returned a leaked copy of Ken Clarke’s budget speech.Back in 1947, the Labour chancellorHugh Dalton was forced to resign after giving a journalist details of his budgetwhile on his way to the chamber. The news made the early evening papers before Dalton finished his speech.Highlighting the gravity of the latest budget breach, Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, suggested in the Commons that the leak could “constitute a criminal act”. He told MPs: “It is utterly outrageous that this has happened.”Richard Hughes, the chair of the OBR, has said he will continue to lead the watchdog unless he loses the confidence of the chancellor, the Treasury committee or parliament. Reeves’s spokesperson said she has “full confidence” in Hughes.“The document was unintentionally uploaded to our website too early,” Hughes told a tense press conference in Westminster. “We’ve initiated an investigation into how and why it happened. It was a mistake in the OBR.”View image in fullscreenGeorge Osborne, the chancellor in 2013, when details of the budget were published in advance.Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PAA Whitehall insider said the mistake was most probably down to human error. “Quite possibly by someone quite junior … no doubt in the middle of the worst day of their working life.”Metadata shows the accidentally published PDF was last modified at 3.10am on Tuesday 25 November.“I guess they created the page, got it ready, and then didn’t realise people would just guess the link,” an economist close to the OBR said. “They should have put it behind a password until the time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One former insider said there were tight checks to stop leaks, including a requirement to use a “secure gateway” to access the documents when away from the office.The leak will provide fresh ammunition for the watchdog’s critics, however. WithinLabourranks, the timing of its productivity downgrade – blowing a multibillion-pound hole in the chancellor’s tax and spending plans on budget day – has caused particular consternation.“I hope this is the beginning of the end,” one government source said. “It’s time to shut it down,” said another.Earlier this month,the TUC urged Reeves to launch a comprehensive review of the OBR, accusing it of being a “cheerleader for austerity” since its creation under Osborne in 2010.Labour MP Jeevun Sandher, an aide at the Department for Business and Trade, said: “The OBR has got their key judgments wrong for 14 years, consistently underestimating the impact of public spending [cuts] on growth. Today they’ve released the forecast document early. Completely unacceptable.”Budget 2025: what it means for youRead moreThere was also significant enthusiasm across Whitehall for Reeves’s decision to stick to one fiscal event a year but two OBR forecasts – meaning she would not necessarily take corrective action next spring in response to the forecast.“This was the original sin that led to the welfare debacle,” one adviser said. “It’s good we’ve realised we don’t actually have to kneecap ourselves twice a year.”However, Labour critics and those close to the watchdog warned that the government had exposed itself to criticism long before the OBR leak, after months of kite-flying and speculation in the run-up to the budget.“This disappointing trend in relation to budget briefings has been growing for a number of years and under successive governments, but appears to have reached an unprecedented high,” said Nusrat Ghani, the deputy speaker of the Commons, who presided over Reeves’s budget speech.“This all falls short of the standards that the House expects.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityHouse of CommonsReutersEconomic policyLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The aggregate hit to the public finances was just £5.5bn – not even wiping out the “headroom” against Reeves’s fiscal rules.But to make space for higher spending and build a buffer against her rules to impress the bond markets, Reeves announced £26bn worth of tax rises by 2029-30.She and Keir Starmer had flirted with the idea of busting the letter of their manifesto pledge and raising income tax, before reverting to the stealthier approach of extending the freeze on income tax thresholds, which usually increase each year in line with inflation.In Wednesday’s lengthy statement, Reeves was blunt: “I am asking everyone to make a contribution.” But she insisted she had minimised the cost for most, through tax changes aimed at ensuring the wealthy pay their share.Why should a landlord pay lower tax than their tenant, she asked, and why should savings be taxed at a lower rate than wages? Several measures in Wednesday’s statement addressed these inequities – including the council tax changes for high-value properties and a 2p increase in income tax on savings and property income.When it came to the economic picture, Reeves’s approach has taken on noticeably more urgency than at last year’s budget.Then, she focused on increasing public investment, in everything from roads to tech, which she sees as key to improving the UK’s soggy productivity; and slower-burn changes, such as planning reform.But employers complained that she was also squeezing hiring and driving up inflation by raising employer national insurance contributions (NICs) by £25bn a year.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThis time round, Reeves had inflation squarely in her sights, and opted for more immediate intervention to tackle the cost of living for cash-strapped households.Major forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund, expect inflation to be higher in the UK this year and next than any other G7 country.Expenditure graphicThe OBR calculated that by freezing train fares and prescription costs, and shifting green levies off utility bills, budget policies could knock 0.4 percentage points off the headline inflation rate.And this is the heart of Reeves’s economic plan. By bringing the cost of living down and restoring the public finances, doubling the headroom against her fiscal rules to £21.7bn, she hopes to calm fractious bond markets, reducing the government’s interest bill. Weaker-than-expected inflation should also open the way to more Bank of England rate cuts, starting on 18 December, that would ripple out across the economy.On the most optimistic reading, Reeves’s second budget could reassure consumers and businesses, rekindle the feelgood factor, boost real wages, and kickstart economic growth. Perhaps, in this rosy world, she might not need to implement all of the tax increases pencilled in for a few years’ time, as growth bails her out.Step one – placating bond investors – appeared to have worked as of Wednesday evening, with the yields on 10-year gilts down 0.06 percentage points, at 4.42%.Yet her tax-raising statement is crash-landing on an economy thateked out growth of only 0.1% in the third quarter. Public trust in the government is at rock bottom; businesses have been fretting about the costs of hiring, since last year’s shock increase in employer NICs.The zigzag route from last July’s “black hole” statement, in which the winter fuel allowance was slashed, through the phantom disability cuts, to Wednesday’s assertion that everyone is making a contribution, hardly helps the mood. And the OBR forecasts suggest growth will remain stodgy, and the outlook for living standards bleak.The bond vigilantes,who were one crucial audiencefor Wednesday’s statement, appeared to be reassured. But it will be some months before it will become clear whether the households and businesses, whose confidence is crucial to rekindling economic growth, will be, too.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesTax and spendingBudgetLabourOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomic policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

There’s your 200-pager,” said Will Marsters, a sales trader at Saxo UK, a trading platform that hosted the Guardian for the announcement. The leak triggered a race across trading desks in the City ofLondonto understand the implications of the leaked forecasts – and laughter at the hapless forecaster.View image in fullscreenTraders at Saxo UK gathered for the budget announcement.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianIt was a chaotic start to the budget, but more important for financial investors and the Treasury was the reaction on currency and bond markets. The Labour government wasdesperate to avoid a repeatof the Liz Truss “mini-budget” debacle, when borrowing costs surged, eventually bringing about the downfall of the Conservative government.The reaction on Wednesday was choppy, but not dramatic by the standards of the Truss government. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt – a measure of the cost of government borrowing – dropped quickly from 4.5% to about 4.42%. A few minutes later it was back up above 4.52%.By the late afternoon yields had fallen back once more, to 4.4%. The declining borrowing cost over the day will likely be a relief for Reeves – and a sign that markets do not think lending money to the UK has become more risky.“The tempered growth didn’t seem too optimistic, which eroded some of the risk premium,” said Marsters.Graph showing dip in cost of borrowing over the dayNeil Wilson, an investor strategist at Saxo UK, said: “There’s no great stinging surprise that has upset markets. That has allowed it to be a bit of a relief.”However, he wondered about the credibility of the forecasts: governments often promise to tighten budgets in later years in order to make the sums add up. With elections expected around the same time, he said the prospect of welfare cuts or tax rises in four years’ time was remote.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will ensure taxes on working people are kept as low as possible.“Labour will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not increase national insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income tax, or VAT.”What did Reeves do last year?Reeves increased public spending significantly atlast year’s budget, funded by £40bn worth of tax rises, the biggest of which was a 1.2p rise in the rate of employers’ national insurance contributions.That move is predicted to raise an additional £25bn a year to the government coffers by 2028-29.What did she do this year?The chancellorhad been consideringraising income tax rates, which would have been a straightforward and undeniable breach of manifesto commitments. Sheeven arguedtwo weeks before the budget: “It would, of course, be possible to stick with the manifesto commitments, but that would require things like deep cuts in capital spending.”In the end, she junked that plan and chose instead to freeze tax thresholds for three years longer than previously planned. This means that, as wages rise, more people will have to start paying income tax – including some people whose only income is the state pension.The Office for Budget Responsibility says the move will raise £8bn a year by 2029-30.What are the arguments that she has broken her manifesto commitments?The wording of Labour’s manifesto promise was that the party would not “increase national insurance, the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, or VAT”. Raising employers’ national insurance contributions last year appears a fairly straightforward breach of that promise.Freezing income tax thresholds would not breach that part of the manifesto. However, given Reeves has previously described exactly such a move as a tax on working people, it arguably breaks the pledge to keep taxes on working people “as low as possible”.What are the arguments that she has not?Last year Reeves argued that her original promise did not apply to employers’ national insurance contributions, only to those made by employees. Officials pointed to the words “working people”, saying this showed she did not intend the promise to apply to employer contributions, only employee ones.This year, her argument is simpler – she promised in the manifesto not to change income tax rates, not thresholds. Although that is complicated slightly by her comments at the last budget that “extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people”.Although it was not a direct promise, Labour’s manifesto noted that the Conservatives had raised taxes to a 70-year high. The Office for Budget Responsibility said on Wednesday that Reeves’ decisions would push them higher than ever recorded.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025LabourRachel ReevesKemi BadenochexplainersShareReuse this content"

Most budgets have a tendency to be moderately well received on the day, only to fall apart when the economist wonks have had a chance to go through the small print 24 hours later. Rachel has tried a rather different approach. The budget of dialectics. Her mission has been to get her budget to fall apart in the weeks and months before she delivered it. Own goal after own goal. It was a thing of Hegelian beauty. All in the hope that everything would be all right on the day and in the weeks after. She is keeping her fingers firmly crossed. Desperate measures for desperate times.You certainly can’t fault Reeves for effort. A pre-budget shambles on this scale doesn’t happen of its own accord. It takes a lot of hard work to create this much chaos. Imagine going to the trouble of calling an early morning press conference to signal you were planning to increase income tax by 2p, only to decide against it the following week. You’ve shown you can’t be entirely trusted to keep your word while getting none of the fiscal benefits. A headless chicken is more sentient than that.The mayhem continued right up to the wire. Just as Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves entered the chamber for prime minister’s questions, it was revealed that the Office for Budget Responsibility – AKA the Office for Budget Irresponsibility – hadaccidentally posted the entire budgeton its website. Somewhere in the OBR, some bored junior had just pressed “Send” before skipping off to an early lunch. No one had told him it was time-sensitive. What’s 90 minutes between friends?Budget 2025: key points at a glanceRead moreRachel looked ashen – as if she was being filmed for a hostage video – and reached for her phone. Texting “Help” to Torsten Bell, the junior Treasury minister who was seated behind her. Torsten likes to think he is the go-to man for any crisis. No one rates Torsten higher than Torsten. He answers only to the name “Genius”.Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Torsten dashed off some advice, which Reeves wrote down, and she could smile again. Nervously. She needn’t have worried. Gilt yields feed on the news. The markets weren’t spooked, everything was as expected. Borrowing costs were falling.Public speaking isn’t Rachel’s natural forte. She stumbles over her words and her delivery is flat. So a one-hour statement is an ordeal for her. And for her audience. But needs must. At least she only has to do it once a year. First came the non mea culpa. The leak of the OBR report was all the fault of the OBR. Nothing to do with her. She was as appalled as the next person. Though possibly not as appalled asKemi Badenoch. There is nothing that doesn’t appal the Tory leader.Still, the OBR leak turned out to be just about the only leak for which Rachel wasn’t responsible. Because the rest of her statement seemed to be a word-for-word rehash of policy announcements and leaks to the media that the country had been drip-fed over the past month. Not even one mini surprise. No rabbit to be pulled out of the hat near the end to make us all forgive and forget. No wonder the Labour backbenchers looked a bit weary half-way through.It is possibly true, as Reeves suggests, that no one has a plan that’s any better. Though you could also call it a low bar. No one is exactly waiting on Mel Stride’s every word. His credibility rating is substantially less than zero. The shadow chancellor who wants to cut the welfare benefits that he increased to record levels as work and pensions minister. And he doesn’t even see the irony. Or realise that the country still is a long way off forgiveness for the mess they created in the past 14 years. It’s going to take a lot longer than 18 months with no apology to wipe the Tory slate clean.It was to the Tories Rachel turned next. Austerity, Brexit, Liz Truss. They were the reason she had had to break the promise she made last year on freezing tax thresholds. Which might have been more convincing if they hadn’t also been the reason she had raised £40bn in tax the year before. So they could hardly have come as a surprise. But successive governments – the Tories included – have always considered fiscal drag a matter of semantics. A promise that no one had ever had any intention of keeping.View image in fullscreen‘Don’t pretend you’re not interested in what I’m saying,’ says Kemi Badenoch in reply to the chancellor’s budget speech.Photograph: House of Commons/House of Commons/PAReplying to the budget speech always used to be one of the more thankless tasks for a leader of the opposition. This time, Kemi had three distinct advantages. Reeves had already briefed its entire contents. Thanks to the OBR she had full knowledge of the growth and inflation forecasts. And, lastly, she had free licence because no one was very interested in what she had to say. The verdict from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and other economics thinktanks were the ones that counted. The budget would stand or fall on their response.So the dice were loaded in Kemi’s favour and it looked as if she could hardly fail. Though she did her best. There is no situation she can’t misjudge. She is a woman with no personal affect. No warmth. A better politician would allow for nuance.Kemi just has one note. There is no room for reflection. Otherwise she would not have insisted Reeves resign and then unresign so that she could then resign again. A 20-minute speech leaves everyone feeling exhausted. She accused Rachel of self-delusion: something that could equally be levelled at her. You could sense her disappointment that Labour hadn’t broken the promise not to raise income tax. She even suggested that a £2m house was just an ordinary family home.“Don’t pretend you’re not interested in what I’m saying.” she snapped near the end. Only no one was interested in what she was saying. The Lib Dem MP Steve Darling’s dog was getting all the attention. Jennie was sitting up to beg and then rolling on her back, demanding to have her tummy rubbed. She was nothing less than adorable. Kemi could learn a thing or two in people skills from her.Rachel got up to leave. It had gone about as well as expected. A solid five out of 10. Her backbenchers had waved their order papers performatively. Largely because they had got their own way. Her budget had survived initial contact with reality. She would keep her fingers crossed it stayed that way tomorrow.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025The politics sketchRachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityBudgetKemi BadenochcommentShareReuse this content"

The complex is made up of eight 31-storey towers containing about 2,000 flats, which house about 4,800 people.Authorities said early on Thursday that three men aged between 52 and 68 had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire.The city’s leader, John Lee, said in the early hours of Thursday morning that the fire was “coming under control”.Authorities declared the incident a five-alarm fire, the highest emergency rating, and at least 128 fire engines and almost 800 firefighters were dispatched to the scene. Roads including major highways near the towers have been closed.Slow zoom out of one of the towers on fire during day“The priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the residents who are trapped,” Lee said. “The second is to support the injured. The third is to support and recover. Then, we’ll launch a thorough investigation.”Shortly after the fire broke out, Derek Armstrong Chan, the deputy director of Hong Kong’s fire services operations, said: “The temperature inside the buildings concerned is very high. It’s difficult for us to enter the building and go upstairs to conduct firefighting and rescue operations.”At least one firefighter, named as Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among the dead.Videos from the scene show flames spread across the towers and visible on every floor, flaring out of windows.Night scene shows fire engulfing many of the towersDozens of shocked residents, many sobbing, watched from nearby pavements as smoke funnelled up from the complex.“There’s nothing that can be done about the property. We can only hope that everyone, no matter old or young, can return safely,” a Tai Po resident who gave their surname as So told Agence France-Presse near the scene of the fire. “It’s heartbreaking. We’re worried there are people trapped inside.”Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block 2 in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise about 2.45pm (6.45am UK time) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. “I immediately went back to pack up my things,” he told Reuters. “I don’t even know how I feel right now. I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight because I probably won’t be able to go back home.”0:57Several trapped as fire engulfs high-rise residential complex in Hong Kong – videoA resident who gave his surname as Wong, 71, broke down in tears, saying his wife was trapped inside one of the buildings.The Wang Fuk Court towers are among the tallest in Tai Po, which, like much of Hong Kong, is among the most densely populated areas in the world. Many residents are elderly, according to 2021 census data reported by CNN.The Hong Kong government said all departments were coordinating to assist the response effort and affected residents.China’s leader, Xi Jinping, expressed his condolences for the victims, China’s state broadcaster said late on Wednesday.Map of Hong Kong.Officials were reported as saying the fire had started in some of theexternal bamboo and mesh scaffolding that encased the towersbefore spreading inside them, but the exact cause is unknown.Building standards in Hong Kong are relatively high and vastly improved in recent decades, but the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, a local advocacy group, expressed deep concern about fires associated with scaffolding, noting similar incidents in April, May and October.Hong Kong’s high property prices have long been a source of social discontent in the city and the fire could stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.View image in fullscreenFirefighters tackle the blaze.Photograph: Kobe Li/Nexpher/Zuma Press/ShutterstockBamboo scaffolding is a ubiquitous sight across Hong Kong’s construction and renovation sites, though the government has said it was being phased out for safety reasons.The Tai Po district authorities have opened shelters in local community halls, at least one of which local media reported was full by Wednesday night, and police have set up acasualty hotline.Several forums and campaign events related to the 7 December elections that had been scheduled for the coming days have been cancelled.The fire is the most deadly in Hong Kong in years. In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a level five fire that lasted for about 20 hours.View image in fullscreenThe fire broke out on Wednesday afternoon.Photograph: Yan Zhao/AFP/Getty ImagesExplore more on these topicsHong KongAsia PacificHong Kong apartment firesnewsShareReuse this content"

While most can control their asthma with inhalers to treat immediate symptoms and preventive ones to reduce inflammation, those with the most severe asthma often take daily doses of oral corticosteroids as well.But long-term use is associated with serious health conditions, including osteoporosis, diabetes and increased vulnerability to infections.Now aninternational clinical trialhas found that participants who received injections oftezepelumabevery four weeks were able to reduce or even stop taking their steroids entirely with no ill effects.Tezepelumab, also known as Tezspire and made by AstraZeneca, binds to and blocks a protein associated with airway inflammation.Antibiotic resistance: how a pioneering trial is using old drugs to save babies from sepsisRead moreThe National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence approved the drug in 2023 as an additional maintenance treatment for patients over 12 whose usual medication does not control their asthma well.The Wayfinder trial, led by Kings College London, involved just under 300 adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were taking 5mg-40mg of steroid tablets daily.The patients, from 11 countries including the UK, US, France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, were given tezepelumab every month.After one year of treatment, more than half of the participants had stopped taking their steroid medication altogether without their asthma flaring up, while nearly 90% had reduced their steroid use to a low dose. A third had stopped taking steroids after six months.Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness. Up to 10% of asthmatics have severe disease and, in the most extreme cases, it can be fatal.The trial findings, published in the the Lancet Respiratory Medicine and presented at the British Thoracic Society winter meeting, also showed that tezepelumab significantly improved asthma symptoms, lung function and overall quality of life. During the study, two-thirds of patients did not have any asthma attacks.The lead author of the study, prof David Jackson, who is a respiratory medicine expert at King’s College London and asthma services clinical lead at Guy’s and Royal Brompton hospitals, said: “As tezepelumab also suppresses allergy-related symptoms and improves chronic rhinosinusitis as well, the results are particularly exciting for patients with severe asthma who suffer with both upper and lower airway symptoms.”Responding to the findings, Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation atAsthma+ Lung UK, said: “This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma.“It’s vital that research into new types of treatment continues, but we know current funding for lung health research is on life support, despite lung conditions remaining the third biggest cause of death in the UK. Studies like this show the positive impact that research can make on providing potentially life-changing treatment for people with asthma and other lung conditions.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Any new interventions that may help patients manage their symptoms more easily and in a safe and effective way would be welcome.“The prospect of a monthly injection, rather than daily tablets, may also be a more manageable treatment option for some patients.“As with any emerging research, it’s important the findings are carefully assessed and considered as clinical guidelines, which GPs use in their daily practice, are developed and updated, based on the latest evidence to ensure safety and benefit for patients.”Explore more on these topicsAsthmaMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The report concluded that Palestine Action was “a risk to UK businesses and legitimate enterprises nationwide” and engaged as a whole in “non-violent direct action”.Another report from the centre in December last year said incidents in which violence had been used were “not the norm for PA (Palestine Action) action, and any harm or injuries historically are assessed to be the result of unintentional or misjudged action through trying to evade capture”.Husain told the court: “The decision to proscribe PA is an unprecedented and disproportionate interference with articles 9, 10 and 11 [freedom of thought, expression and protest].“D [the defendant] has imposed extreme measures on a protest group (which enjoyed widespread popularity among the British public) seeking to expose, protest and prevent serious violations of international law by Israel, and the complicity of the UK government and companies in the UK therewith, including by seeking to obstruct the continuing supply of weapons and components to Israel.“D has deployed this most repressive of regimes against PA, notwithstanding that, on her own evidence, only four out of hundreds of its actions are even capable of meeting the definition of serious property damage.”The case is likely to determine whether more than 2,000 people arrested for alleged support of Palestine Action – mostly for holding placards stating: “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action” – will face criminal trial. At least five people holding such signs were taken away by officers outside the court on Wednesday.Sir James Eadie KC, representing the home secretary, said in written submissions that proscription had had the intended effect of “disrupting PA’s pattern of escalatory conduct” and had “not prevented people from protesting in favour of the Palestinian people or against Israel’s actions in Gaza”.He added: “Even if the proscription of PA did interfere with individuals’ article 9, 10 and 11 rights, the proscription of PA was and remains proportionate.”Eadie said some of the group’s actions fell within the statutory definition of terrorism, adding: “It is no answer to assert that other action by PA may have been lawful; or that some of its members or supporters were not involved in any such action. PA engaged in terrorism, as the SSHD [secretary of state for the home department] was advised and concluded.“The objective of proscription was to deal with the organisation on that basis; and to do so in precisely the manner authorised by parliament.”The hearing is expected to conclude next week, with judgment on whether to quash the proscription order coming at a later date.On Tuesday, one of six prisoners affiliated to Palestine Action who are on hunger strike, demanding among other things the lifting of the ban, was taken to hospital.Kamran Ahmed, who has been held at HMP Pentonville in London for over a year and is due to stand trial next year, joinedthe rolling hunger strikeon 10 November. Prisoners for Palestine said he had lost 6kg (13lbs) and had been suffering from dizziness, breathing difficulties and chest pains, as well as low blood sugar and dangerously high ketone levels.His sister, Shamina Amal, said: “I am disgusted that the government has chosen to ignore the hunger strikers with no care or consideration to their sanctity of their health and lives.”More than 100 medical doctors have signed a letter to NHS England’s health and justice team urging it to intervene on the prisoners’ behalf.Explore more on these topicsPalestine ActionProtestUK criminal justiceUK security and counter-terrorismLondonnewsShareReuse this content"

In mitigation it said the ward was not equipped to deal with vulnerable mental health patients but that the trust had accepted Ellame amid a national shortage of mental health beds for children and adolescents.Judge Szagun said: “Any organisation entrusted with the care of amongst the most vulnerable in society … should be alert to and proactive to changes in advice and guidance.“That should have covered the recognition of the increased pressures and demands being placed on such wards by the need for them to accommodate the more risky and needy patients such as Ellame.”Ellame’s parents expressed fury at trust’s failure to prevent their daughter’s death. In a statement read outside the court, her father, Ken, said: “There is no greater heartbreak than losing a child, but to lose a child you believed was being kept safe creates a pain beyond measure, and a deep, searing anger.”He urged the government to use the fine to improve children’s mental health provision. “No financial penalty could ever feel proportionate to the destruction that has been caused. We would take some comfort were the secretary for health to direct the funds toward strengthening children’s mental health services, an area in such urgent need of support.”The family is pursuing a separate claim for damages against the trust. Ellame’s mother added: “We do not want to say more at this stage as we do not want to risk jeopardising the ongoing legal proceedings. This prosecution is an important step in highlighting just one of the many failings in Ellame’s care and brings a first taste of justice on behalf of our darling girl.”Jodie Anderson, a senior caseworker at the charity Inquest, which has been supporting the family, said: “We need urgent action to ensure further failures and harms by mental health services are prevented, and to ensure every child and young person in distress receives the care and support they need.”At last month’s hearing the trust pleaded guilty to a failure to provide safe care and treatment, resulting in avoidable harm. Eleanor Sanderson, the counsel for UHSussex, told the hearing: “The trust accepts the core failing was the 2019 missing patient policy. It wasn’t clear about what to do when a patient absconds.”An inquest into Ellame’s death opened last year. It was adjourned pending the outcome of the prosecution.In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

First studying painting and printed textiles at the Glasgow School of Art, she moved to London to study at the Royal College of Art. It was here, as part of the club scene, that she began designing proper: initially making notice-me outfits to guarantee her entry into Steve Strange’s Blitz club, then moving to the catwalk in 1981. By 1989, i-D magazine called her “the most consistently inventive British fashion designer (alongside Vivienne Westwood)”. Hogg, it wrote, “has been described as ‘100% party girl’ and has designed the clothes to match”. Other party girls wore her clothes: Paula Yates, Debbie Harry and Siouxsie Sioux.View image in fullscreenPam Hogg at the Mary Quant exhibition private view at the V&A Museum in 2019.Photograph: Anthony Harvey/ShutterstockShe became a personality in her own right, with her shock of blond hair, quiff, red lipstick and winged eyeliner her trademark look. She appeared on the front of i-D in 1989, and on the Wogan Show in 1990 – the day after her birthday party. “I was off my head,”she told the Guardian in 2018. “I was wearing my black PVC leggings and Terry Wogan remarked that they looked uncomfortable. So my immediate reaction was: ‘Are they?’ and I sat on his lap.”Hogg’s rock’n’roll spirit lent itself to her next move – as fashion moved to a more minimal look in the 1990s, she swapped the catwalk for the stage, as the lead singer in the band Doll. Opening for the likes of Blondie and the Raincoats, she continued to design with suitably extrovert costumes, and she retained her A-list circle. Remembering this era withthe Gentlewomanmagazine in 2017, Hogg described an outfit with a Ziggy Stardust flash she had made. “Last year I took it to Kate Moss’s for her Bowie-themed birthday party at her Cotswolds home,” she said. “When I got there, she immediately tore off the amazing couture dress she was wearing and put it on. That was kind of gratifying.”View image in fullscreenThe Pam Hogg show at London fashion week spring/summer 2019 in September 2018.Photograph: Richard Young/ShutterstockHogg came back to fashion in the 2000s, designing outfits for musicians including Rihanna, Björk and Kylie Minogue, and returning to the catwalk in 2009, showcasing tight, brightly coloured catsuits and more. “I knew that one day I would return to fashion,”she told Vogue in 2021. “I still sew every single catwalk piece myself. I make it all to fit me, except that everything is four inches longer for the models.”Hogg remained fond of nightlife, with her trademark hair – by now lemon yellow – aviator sunglasses, teddy boy-style jackets and catsuits spotted at parties during fashion week and beyond in London for decades. She continued to show collections until recently, and designed bespoke pieces including a semi-sheer wedding dress for Lady Mary Charteris in 2012, a design that is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I never, ever, ever would have said or done anything like that directly to a human being. Absolutely not.”Analysis:Ettedgui is actually one of several contemporaries from minority ethnic backgrounds to claim Farage abused them when they were at school.Ettedgui, a Jewish student, has said: “[Farage] would sidle up to me and growl, ‘Hitler was right’ or ‘gas them’, sometimes adding a long hiss to simulate the sound of the gas showers.”Cyrus Oshidar has said Farage repeatedly called him a “Paki”.Another former pupil told the Guardian he was also directly targeted by Farage.“[Farage] walked up to a pupil, flanked by two similarly tall mates, and spoke to anyone looking ‘different’. That included me on three occasions; asking me where I was from, and pointing away, saying, ‘That’s the way back’ to wherever you replied you were from.”The claim:Farage suggested the allegation he abused Ettedgui had only come from Ettedgui himself.Analysis:This is wrong.Seven other contemporaries have come forward to say they saw Farage abusing Ettedgui with antisemitic language.Stefan Benarroch said: “[Ettedgui] was such a gentle soul and Farage – Farage made his life a fucking nightmare … They could only identify us, because we had to go to this stupid Jewish service in the science labs school. I mean, none of us were remotely religious. They would hang out there. Farage would hang out with his minions. And then they would taunt us as we would leave.”Rickard Berg said: “He definitely had a go at Peter and there were a couple of others he would also have a go at … He was nasty, there was no question. [The song] Gas ’em all, I heard him singing it to Ettedgui. I didn’t get it at the time, because Peter didn’t react. Back in the day, you thought it was for him to react.”Anthony Butler said: “I clearly recall him relentlessly hectoring and bullying Ettedgui with shouts of ‘stupid yid’ in the playground.” Butler offered an apology to Ettedgui.Jean-Pierre Lihou said: “[Farage] used to say things like, you know, ‘Jude’, to Peter, which is the German for Jew, in the way it was said in the 1930s, a long ‘u’ in a menacing way, you know? It’s pretty awful.”Bob Jope, a former teacher, said: “I think he [Farage] said ‘Shut up you Jew’ to Peter Ettedgui.”Martin Rosell said: “[Farage] certainly made comments to the Jewish guy in that class, Peter Ettedgui … Comments like, under his breath, sort of ‘Jew’ … and comments about how they ‘missed you’, that sort of thing.”Quick GuideContact Henry Dyer about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

None of them say, I directly attack them or abuse them,” Farage said. “What they do say, they do say, very clearly, is they have different political views to me.”Analysis:The overwhelming majority of the contemporaries that the Guardian has spoken to are not active in party politics.Some disagree with him, and dislike Reform, but they say they came forward because of his denials about his past behaviour – and their expectation that he should show some contrition.One of those who spoke out, Martin Rosell, is the chair of the Liberal Democrats in Salisbury. Farage was told this by the Guardian prior to publication. His account is supported by others.Farage has cited the example of Roger Gough, a former Conservative leader of Kent county council.But Gough was not among the individuals who claimed they had either been victims of, or witnesses to, racist and antisemitic behaviour by Farage.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKexplainersShareReuse this content"

Three of them speak out hereAngelique Chrisafisin ParisWed 26 Nov 2025 08.49 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 13.57 ESTShareWhen Sylvie Delezenne, a marketing expert from Lille, was job-hunting in 2015, she was delighted to be contacted on LinkedIn by a human resources manager at the French culture ministry, inviting her to Paris for an interview.“It was my dream to work at the culture ministry,” she said.But instead of finding a job, Delezenne, 45, is now one of more than 240 women at the centre of a criminal investigation into the alleged drugging of women without their knowledge in a place they never expected to be targeted: a job interview.An investigating judge is examining allegations that, over a nine-year period, dozens of women interviewed for jobs by a senior civil servant, Christian Nègre, were offered coffees or teas by him that had been mixed with a powerful and illegal diuretic, which he knew would make them need to urinate.Nègre often suggested continuing the interviews outside, on lengthy strolls far from toilets, the women say. Many of the women recall struggling with the need to go to the toilet and feeling increasingly ill. Some, in desperation, say they urinated in public, or didn’t reach a bathroom in time, wetting their clothes. Some felt a sense of shame and failure that has had an impact on their lives, they say.“At the time, I didn’t even know this type of attack existed,” Delezenne said.The alleged assaults came to light in 2018, after a colleague reported Nègre allegedly attempting to photograph the legs of a senior official, prompting police to open an investigation. Officers found a computer spreadsheet titled “Experiments”, where he had allegedly noted the times of druggings and the women’s reactions.View image in fullscreenThe case is the latest in France to cast a spotlight on allegations of drug-facilitated abuse, known in the country as ‘chemical submission’.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianIn 2019, removed from the ministry and the civil service, Nègre was placed under formal investigation on several charges ranging from drugging to sexual assault. His lawyer, Vanessa Stein, said he would not comment while the investigation continues. Awaiting trial, Nègre has been able to continue working in the private sector.Louise Beriot, a lawyer for several of the women, said of the alleged druggings: “Under the pretext of a sexual fantasy, this is about power and domination over women’s bodies … through humiliation and control.”Six years on, the case is the latest in France to cast a spotlight on drug-facilitated abuse, known in the country as “chemical submission”. The term became prominent last year whenGisèle Pelicotwaived her anonymity in thetrial of dozens of menwho were found guilty of raping her after she had been drugged unconscious by her ex-husband.But several women in the job interview drugging investigation said their case was taking too many years to come to trial, only increasing their trauma. “Six years later, we’re still waiting for a trial, which is mind-blowing,” said one of the women, known by the pseudonym Émilie. “It’s taking too long. The justice process is bringing more trauma than healing. That’s not what justice is supposed to be about.”My hands were trembling, my heart was palpitating. I said I needed a break. But he kept on walking.Sylvie DelezenneDelezenne was 35 when she was invited to the prestigious culture ministry building near Paris’s Louvre museum and was shown by Nègre to a meeting room. Out of politeness, she said, she accepted a coffee. “In an interview situation, I’d never say no,” she said.The vending machine was in a busy corridor, and Delezenne said she pressed the button herself for a lightly sweetened coffee. She said Nègre had picked up her cup, turned to greet a colleague, then moved across the corridor, before returning and handing her the drink. He allegedly suggested going outside to view some monuments, adding: “The weather’s marvellous; shall we keep walking?”Delezenne said she was led around the Tuileries gardens answering questions for a long time, with the entire interview process lasting several hours. She focused on her need for a job, having left her previous position for health reasons and knowing that her savings were dwindling.“But I felt an increasing need to urinate,” she said. “My hands were trembling, my heart was palpitating, beads of sweat ran down my forehead and I was turning red. I said: ‘I’m going to need a technical break.’ But he kept on walking.”View image in fullscreen‘I had nightmares, angry outbursts. I didn’t look for work; I thought I was useless,’ Delezenne said.Photograph: Ed Alcock/The GuardianEventually, she couldn’t hold on: “I wasn’t well; I thought what can I do?” She had to crouch down at the side of a tunnel leading to a footbridge across the Seine. She said: “He approached, took off his jacket and said: ‘I’ll shield you.’ I thought that was strange.”She was devastated. “I thought: ‘I’ve wrecked my interview.’” On the way home she was abnormally thirsty, quickly downing litres of water. “My feet were so swollen they were bleeding from rubbing my shoes.”In the months and years that followed, Delezenne blamed herself for “messing up”. She avoided going to Paris and stopped applying for jobs. “I had nightmares, angry outbursts. I didn’t look for work; I thought I was useless,” she said.Four years later, in 2019, police contacted her. She said she discovered her details had been entered into a spreadsheet, along with photographs of her lower legs. She has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. “The time this is taking to come to trial is weighing on me,” she said. “The anger is not going away.”Another woman to have been contacted by police is Anaïs de Vos, who was 28 when she applied for a job as a managerial assistant at the culture ministry in 2011. She doesn’t habitually drink coffee. “But in an interview when someone offers coffee, especially the manager, you say yes,” she said. Nègre went to a corner of the meeting room to prepare it himself, she said.He looked me in the eye and said: 'Do you need a wee?' I found it bizarre.Anaïs de VosHe suggested they walk outside, but de Vos started to need the toilet, and asked to head back because she was cold. Instead, she said, he crossed the road in the other direction, to the banks of the Seine.She said: “He looked me in the eye and said: ‘Do you need a wee?’ It was like an adult talking to a child. I found it bizarre, so I replied quite coldly.” He gestured to a storage unit under a bridge as a place to urinate, but she refused. “I had a warning light in my head telling me there was something wrong.”Nègre suggested going towards the Louvre. But the toilet that de Vos found cost €1 and Nègre had told her to leave her bag behind at the ministry. She had no money, and he said he had none to lend her.Eventually, unable to cope, she entered a cafe. The toilet was upstairs, and as soon as she saw the door, she began to wet her clothes, but managed to dry herself. On the train home later, she said she had felt “really ill and as if I was about to faint”.She wasn’t surprised to be contacted by police in 2019. “I always thought something was strange,” she said. “The justice system has taken too long … For us, it feels like we’re being victimised a second time.”Émilie, whose lawyer advised she use a pseudonym because the investigation is ongoing, was 29 and established in the arts world when she began looking for a new job in 2017. She was contacted by Nègre on LinkedIn and invited to the regional culture office in Strasbourg, where he then worked. He offered her tea and left the room to make it himself, before continuing the interview on a river walk and cathedral visit, which lasted two hours, she said.She said: “I wanted to go to the bathroom, but he said: ‘There are no toilets here. Let’s just carry on.’ He was walking very, very slowly, stopping to ask questions. I was feeling dizzy; I thought I might pass out.” She made it back, and he showed her straight to a private toilet directly adjoining his office. “It felt really weird,” she said.Two years later, she heard about a media report on an investigation into alleged drugging with diuretics by an unnamed figure at the culture ministry. “Suddenly everything made sense, but it was an immense shock,” she said. She filed a complaint with police. She left her Strasbourg job, and later leftFrance.Beriot said the case was on an “extraordinary scale” and the unusually long investigation amounted in legal terms to “secondary victimisation” of the women by the justice system. She said: “The Pelicot trial was a very important first step and chemical submission remains a vast issue.”Some women have won compensation in a civil case against the state, where the culture ministry itself was not found to be at fault. A culture ministry official said it was committed to preventing harassment and sexual violence and providing support to survivors.The CGT culture trade union said: “We want the ministry to recognise its responsibility as an employer – there is a systemic problem, which enabled a senior civil servant to act like this for a decade.” The union said other staff had previously made allegations against him, accusing him of taking pictures of women’s legs in meetings.Delezenne, who now works in marketing for a hairdresser in Lille, said: “My priority is that this never happens to anyone else again.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

This powerful film lays out the effects of the toxic H2O – and their long struggle for justiceHannah J DaviesWed 26 Nov 2025 17.20 ESTShareIt is becoming a cliche to liken issues-based TV dramas and documentaries to Mr Bates vs the Post Office. Nevertheless, you get the sense that Poison Water is hoping to do for communities affected by the shocking inaction of the water industry what ITV’s hit did for the subpostmasters wrongly criminalised because of a software glitch. A damning one-off, it tells the story of Britain’s biggest mass poisoning and the apparent greed and incompetence that has meant it has loomed large in victims’ lives ever since. There are also parallels with the recent dramaToxic Town, and the continued fight for those affected by poisonous waste in Corby in Northamptonshire.We open in the summer of 1988, when residents in several towns and villages in north Cornwall noticed something strange about the water coming out of their taps. It was blue in some cases, black in others, and could be gelatinous or sticky. It was also accompanied by a rapid outbreak of ill health, from vomiting and diarrhoea to rashes, blisters and severe headaches. For some, the effects were temporary, but many people went on to have long-term health problems, and there were even premature deaths that families are convinced were caused by the water they drank and bathed in that summer. Water that – because of an error at a treatment facility – had been laced with toxic amounts of aluminium sulphate. It would take more than two weeks for those in power to admit there was a problem. In the meantime, residents were told the water was perfectly safe, and to mix it with orange squash to improve the taste.Carole Wyatt, a resident of the sleepy village of St Minver, says she didn’t want to speak about the poisoning again. Thank goodness she changed her mind, as she quickly becomes one of the programme’s most outspoken interviewees. There’s blooper-ish humour as Wyatt urges the programme-makers not to edit her down like they did on an episode of the BBC’s Horizon at the time, and to keep in the “good bits”. Things quickly become less droll, as she explains what she wants them to preserve. “Miscarriage of justice, I want that in … before I die I want this truth to come out.” As we learn, justice has indeed been scant – bar a government apology – with calls for a public inquiry unanswered in the intervening years.View image in fullscreen‘Before I die, I want this truth to come out’ … Carole Wyatt.Photograph: BBC/Keo Films & Button Down/Mei WilliamsPoisonWaterrelies heavily on that Horizon episode and other archive material, and there is a risk that the final product could feel more like a repackaging than an original piece. Naturally, though, taking a four-decade step back from events casts them in a different light. And there are enough new interviews here – with residents, experts and politicians – to bring the whole thing startlingly, discomfitingly into the present. Among those interviewed is Michael Howard, then minister for water and planning under Margaret Thatcher. He is shown a letter obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, in which an employee of the water inspectorate had urged the government to go easy on the whole thing, lest prosecutions “render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City” (this was at a time when the government was preparing for the privatisation of the water industry). Howard says he isn’t sure he ever saw the letter. “I hope you’ll emphasise that it was a long time ago and I can’t remember,” he adds. He strongly denies any suggestion of a cover-up or collusion, describing it as “a terrible mistake which should never have happened”.There are many people, though, who remember that time very well, and whose lives were permanently changed by it. As well as Wyatt – who has had a number of health problems since – we meet Doug Cross, a scientist who was well placed to understand what was unfolding in his town, Camelford, and who tried from the beginning to hold the authorities to account. His wife, Carole, died in 2004 when she was 59, after experiencing a sudden onset of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Postmortem tests showed that she had severely elevated levels of aluminium in her brain. As a scientist, Cross is aware that there is no definitive proof that the incident caused his wife’s dementia. But there has also been no effort to try to find out whether it might have, or how it truly affected the 20,000 people whose water supply was contaminated.Leslie Nicks, then head of operations at the South West Water authority, says he couldn’t stand the thought of the programme airing without someone who knew what was happening speaking out. Now, he says, he “just wants the truth known”. You can only hope that those in power are finally listening.Poison Water aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewWater industryWaterreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Cornish scenery was picturesque, the topographical detail exact and the subject matter covered not only violent crime, but the fishing industry and new age travellers.In all this work, Shepherd was a model of low-key naturalism and intense concentration. You really could never see the joins in his acting; his inflections and changes of gear always perfectly judged, in a light tenor voice (though he sang as a baritone). Socially, too, he was low-key and resolutely non-partisan; his passion lay in the acting.He was born inLeeds, the only child of Thomas Shepherd, a cabinetmaker, and his wife Violet (nee Hodgson), a teacher at an infant school. Jack was educated at Roundhay school in Leeds and King’s College, Newcastle (now Newcastle University), where he studied fine arts.On graduating, he realised he wanted to be an actor and enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, before leaving with a breakaway group of teachers and students to form the more radical Drama Centre. He survived on money earned designing the sets for student productions.His professional debut came at the Royal Court in the 1966 season, where he appeared in John Arden’s Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance, inArnold Wesker’s underrated Their Very Own and Golden City (with Ian McKellen) and, as a grotesque Mère Ubu opposite Max Wall’s Père Ubu, in Alfred Jarry’s surreal Ubu Roi, designed by David Hockney.For the next five years Shepherd was a core member of the Court’s company, playing Solyony in Three Sisters (withGlenda JacksonandMarianne Faithfull), Malvolio in Twelfth Night, and key roles in two ofEdward Bond’s best plays, The Narrow Road to the Deep North and Early Morning. He won a most promising actor award from the critics for the titular role inDavid Storey’s The Restoration of Arnold Middleton.View image in fullscreenJack Shepherd in his own play Chasing the Moment at the Arcola theatre, London, in 2007.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianShepherd returned to the Court in 1974 in David Hare’s Teeth ’n’ Smiles, about the implosion of a rock group at a Cambridge May Ball, opposite Helen Mirren. In the same year, he played in Hare’s revival of Griffiths’ The Party at the National – a superb analysis of fall-out and factionalism on the left – only a year after its premiere there with Laurence Olivier in his last stage role; Shepherd played, urgently and superbly, the part first taken byFrank Finlay.In between he had been a founder member of the touring Actors’ Company formed by McKellen and Edward Petherbridge, playing Vasques in the Jacobean shocker ’Tis Pity She’s a Whore and a police inspector in a French farce, Ruling the Roost, in 1972; this was seen at the Edinburgh festival, where he returned in 1973 as Dracula in a play of that title that he co-wrote and took down south to the Bush.A mark of Shepherd’s career was that he appeared – on stage and television – in the work of so many fine contemporary writers. Like Bill Nighy, he was not really an Elizabethan hose and ruff sort of performer.On television with Griffiths he explored the dichotomy of political principle and compromise in Bill Brand, and All Good Men (1974); and in a stage play, Occupations (1971, televised in 1974), which anatomised the 1920 Fiat factory occupation refracted through the playwright’s response to the political climate after the 1968 protests in France.At the National, as a linchpin member of Bryden’s company, he played in bristling American plays by David Mamet, notably the world premiere of Glengarry Glen Ross (1983), the best play about estate agents, for which Shepherd won a best actor Olivier (back then, a Society of West End Theatre, ie SWET, award) and, of course, the magnificent Mystery Plays trilogy byTony Harrison.The Mysteries started with The Nativity in 1977, followed by The Passion in 1980 and finally Doomsday, performed with the other two in 1985. The whole NT shebang was generously revived under Trevor Nunn in 1999, and Shepherd reprised his compelling, incisive portrayals of Lucifer, Judas and Satan.On the way, he featured in a Peter Flannery mini-series (co-devised by Helena Kennedy) about the work of radical barristers, Blind Justice (1988), and later maintained his radical momentum in Peter Kosminsky’s Shoot to Kill (1990), which dramatised the events leading up to theStalkerinquiry concerning the killing of suspected terrorists by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary; and in Paula Milne’sThe Politician’s Husband(2013), in which he was an agitated politics professor father of David Tennant’s senior cabinet minister snared in a tangled marriage with Emily Watson.View image in fullscreenJack Shepherd (Serebryakov) and Amanda Hale (Sonya) in Uncle Vanya by Anton Chekhov at the St James’s theatre, London, 2014.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianHe never broke through as a leading film actor, but he appeared in some good material, starting in 1969 as an underwater vicar in Richard Lester’s apocalyptic black comedy The Bed Sitting Room (based on a Spike Milligan play) and inLeslie Thomas’s The Virgin Soldiers, produced byNed Sherrin.He was in two notable Michael Winterbottom films –Wonderland(1999), a clever, striking, even (opined the New York Times) Chekhovian study, of three London sisters over a five-day period and the rather brilliant, bizarreA Cock and Bull Story(2005), based on Tristram Shandy, with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon.His plays included In Lambeth (at the Donmar in 1989), a riveting conversation about revolution between William Blake and Thomas Paine, with Blake’s wife holding the ring, and the ambitiousHolding Fire!(at Shakespeare’s Globe, 2007) set against the rise and fall of the 19th-century Chartist movement.Shepherd lived in later years with his second wife, Ann Scott, the television and film producer, in London and East Sussex, where he produced community stagings of Dorian Gray and Thomas Hardy’s Under the Greenwood Tree.He was first married in 1965 to Judith Harland (they divorced in 1971), with whom he had two children, Jan and Jake, who survive him, as do Ann, whom he married in 1975, and their three children, twins Victoria and Catherine, and Ben. He is also survived by four grandchildren, Kit, Nora, Rose and Esme.Jack (John) Shepherd, actor, playwright and director, born 29 October 1940; died 24 November 2025Explore more on these topicsTelevisionLeedsNational TheatreCornwallTheatreRoyal Court theatreobituariesShareReuse this content"

How can you relax and build community without a communal area?Leah HarperWed 26 Nov 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 12.39 ESTShare‘Without a living room, your world becomes quite small,” says Georgie, a 27-year-old climbing and outdoor instructor. When she moved into a house-share with four strangers in 2023, she wasn’t worried about the lack of a living room. “I kind of thought it would be fine – I didn’t have that many options, and the house was by far the cheapest.”The property she rented was in Leeds, and what had once been a lounge had gradually been turned into an inaccessible storage space. To make things worse, the kitchen was tiny: “By the time you put a table against the wall, you couldn’t sit or stand without getting in the way of the sink or the oven.”As a result, Georgie and her housemates tended to cook separately, taking meals back to their respective bedrooms to eat – but the lack of a living room left her feeling isolated. “You miss shared experiences,” she says. “It was hard to invite people over because not everyone wants to sit in a bedroom – there wasn’t space for a proper chair – and your bedroom becomes less relaxing, and more stressful.” She would go to friends’ houses for dinner, but they rarely came to hers. “I felt really bad because they were always hosting me and I couldn’t return the favour. Eating, sleeping, socialising and working in a bedroom can lead you to feel trapped.” She lived there until buying her own place – with a living room – in February this year. “I love it,” she says, “and I’m way happier.”View image in fullscreenA third of those living in a shared property said they would willingly forgo a living room in return for cheaper rent.Photograph: Posed by models; Caia Image/Getty Images/Collection Mix: Subjects RFLiving rooms have long been commonplace within western homes and something many of us take for granted, but according to recent research from SpareRoom, a growing number of rentals advertised on the house-sharing website come without living room access. Between January and June this year, 29.8% of rooms listed in the UK were in properties without a living room, rising to 41.2% in London. Almost half (49%) of all renters surveyed reported that the living room in their home is now being used as a bedroom.The term “living room”, as opposed to “drawing room” or “parlour”, is widely credited to Edward Bok, the former editor of the Ladies’ Home Journal, who popularised the term around the late 19th to early 20th century. Social formalities had begun to relax, and communal spaces were starting to be used more casually, having also become more attainable among the middle classes.Bok believed it “foolish”to have an expensively furnished room that was used only on special occasions, and hoped that renaming it would encourage daily use.View image in fullscreenA 1930s family enjoying a cosy moment.Photograph: H Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStockArguably, he succeeded: these days, the living room is often a place to slump on the sofa, eat a TV dinner and scroll on your phone to your heart’s content. But could we do without it? Or does shared space still hold value within the home?Opinions are divided. According toSpareRoom’s research, 44% believe not having a living room may have affected their mental health. Even so, as the cost of living crisis continues, more than a third (36%) of those living in a shared property said they would willingly forgo a living room in return for cheaper rent.For Louis Platman, the curator and research manager at the Museum of the Home in London, getting rid of the living room is a recipe for disaster. “Just from personal experience, going into friends’ flatshares where there isn’t any living room, it’s really hard to build that sense of community and friendship without a place to gather,” he says. “Asfewer and fewer people are owning their own homes, and most people can’t afford to rent a whole house, landlords will seek to convert whatever space is available into a bedroom for another £1,000 a month in rent. It’s going to become increasingly difficult [to save the living room] without a wider recognition, or potentially a legal recognition, of the right to a shared leisure space, and its importance to our wellbeing, as well as our sense of home.”But this is not the first time that the end of the living room has been mooted. “For centuries, the communal area in the home would have been around the fire – even in one-room houses,” says Platman. But when central heating and electric heating became more commonplace in the 1930s and 1940s, this began to change. “Bedrooms could become ‘living rooms’, and more time was spent in these rooms now that they could be heated easily for the first time. There was a lot of commentary announcing ‘the death of the family’ as there was no longer any necessity to gather in one place; people likeGeorge Orwell were deploring the demise of the hearth as the family hub.”View image in fullscreenIn many properties, bedrooms are doubling up as living rooms.Photograph: Posed by models; Patricio Nahuelhual/Getty ImagesThe concept of shared leisure space was restored with the invention of the television: initially, most homes would only have been able to afford one TV set, so everyone would gather around it. But the way in which we watch TV has also changed hugely, especially in recent years: in 2024, it was reported thatless than half of 16- to 24-year-olds are now watching traditional TV(live and catchup programming on a television set at home) each week, compared with 76% just five years before. Only the over-75s slightly increased their traditional TV viewing compared with the previous year, and then only by 1%. When viewers do tune in, streaming via separate screens has become the norm – eliminating the need for a communal space once again.Sometimes we would hang out in the stairwell and upstairs landing, or in one of the bigger bedrooms“That’s been happening since the 80s, when second TV sets became pretty cheap and you’d get people watching in their bedrooms, or even having a small set in the bathroom,” says Platman. “It’s becoming more atomised – and now, with entertainment on demand, we’re losing both the time and the place that was connecting people in this way.”Not everyone sees this as a loss. When Imogen, who is 34 and works in the culture sector, first moved to London in 2011, she lived with two housemates in a two-bed flat. “With the landlord’s permission, we turned the sitting room into a third bedroom and split the rent three ways,” she says. “We were all forging careers in the arts while working hospitality and front-of-house jobs … It was the money-saving mechanism we all needed to build [our] careers.”Without a lounge, their small kitchen became a social hub. “We cooked, ate, socialised, gamed, entertained and crafted together, and forged relationships we wouldn’t have if we were spread across multiple rooms. It was the least comfortable and most social five years of my life.” While Imogen does now own a house with a sitting room, she says she finds herself saving it for “best” and sitting in the kitchen instead, “because that’s where life really happens”.Repurposing living spaces is not always as straightforward as it initially seems. When 25-year-old Salli, from Essex,first moved into a shared student house in her fourth year of university, it appeared that they would have a good amount of space, even without a designated living room. “The house was a typical student house: once built for a family, then transformed to fit the maximum amount of bedrooms in order to maximise rent,” she says. “Although we were six [occupants] and six bedrooms, practically there were eight or nine there most days with everyone’s partners.” Still, they had a bathroom, as well as two shower rooms, a kitchen, and a conservatory that could fit two sofas and an armchair – it seemed like plenty of space for socialising.View image in fullscreenBy the Heath, by Robert Barnes, 1840–95.Photograph: Sepia Times/Universal Images Group/Getty Images“However, as nights got colder and spiders found their way in, we soon realised why an indoor living room is nice to have,” says Salli. “We would sometimes bring a TV down to the conservatory and play games there, but lighting, temperature and plug sockets were an issue. Sometimes we would hang out in the stairwell and upstairs landing, or in one of the bigger bedrooms, but eventually the owner of the room would naturally want to use it. It would have been nice to sometimes drink beer or celebrate birthdays indoors, and not where you could see your own breath.”Most architects and interior designers I speak to are hesitant to recommend ditching the living room – although admittedly, most of their clients tend not to be short on space. “Having lived without a lounge, I think it’s a pretty horrible idea to be honest,” says Peter Markos, the architect/director atMarkos Design Workshop. He was renting in London in 2020 when the landlord suggested changing the living room into another bedroom so they could pay less rent. “Once the living room was converted, there were six of us living there: the only place to talk is the kitchen, the only place to eat is the kitchen, so everyone’s on top of each other. It’s really not the nicest experience. There’s nowhere to just watch TV or read a book.”In the end, not having a sitting room was a decisive factor in Markos moving back to Birmingham, where his budget allowed for more space. “The quality of life was so much better,” he says. “I could see that, in terms of my own mental health and personal satisfaction, if I stuck around in London, the best I could afford was a house with a kitchen that does everything. I always tell clients to make the most of the space available. Clever, smart interventions – how you use storage, how you use the space – can make the world of difference. But there is a tipping point with that, where you get to the other extreme and say, ‘Oh well, we’re not going to have a lounge.’”A built-in banquette can double as a lounge area; a large dining table can transition from workspace to dinner party settingRegan Billingsley, the principal at Regan Billingsley Interiors and founder of lifestyle brandRB Curated, is open to the idea of rooms evolving, based on how they are used. “It really depends on how you live,” she says. “Every home should reflect the rhythm of the people in it. A living room today should flex with your life: a space for connection, relaxation and creativity.”For those without the option of a traditional lounge, however, she stresses there are solutions. “From a design perspective, open-plan kitchens, dining areas and even wide hallways can be layered with texture, lighting and furniture placement to create natural gathering points,” Billingsley says. “A built-in banquette can double as a lounge area; a large dining table can transition from workspace to dinner party setting.”But like many of those who have experienced homes without a lounge, Platman remains unconvinced. “I think having a living room is essential to a healthy home life, whether that’s a traditional family set-up, or flatsharing, or an intergenerational home, which is becoming increasingly common now.” It’s crucial, he says, to have a room that belongs to everyone; a space that can foster conversation and “just lets people relax”.Explore more on these topicsHomesInteriorsRenting propertyArchitecturePropertyHousingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Our panel respondsPolly Toynbee,Julia Davies,Abi O'Connor,Jason Okundaye,John Redwood,Sarah NankivellandAndy SummersAfter a tumultuous run-up to a make-or-break moment for the government, has the chancellor struck the right balance?Wed 26 Nov 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 13.37 ESTShareThis was a Labour budget – it reminds us there can be a better BritainPolly ToynbeeGuardian columnistThis budget will be remembered for finally abolishing the monstrous two-child benefit cap. That’s what Labour budgets do, boosting the low-paid, taking from the well-off. Children always come first, as 450,000 will bereleased from poverty, more than in any budget before. The chancellor reeled off Labour’s too often ignored child-first priorities: universal nurseries from nine months, breakfast clubs, more free school meals, school libraries, a youth guarantee. No, not back to 2010, but it’s progress. This doesn’t totally restore Sure Start, but in Best Start we see the beginnings ofits rebirth.After four months of tortured U-turns, dithering and leaking that spooked markets and paralysed spending, here is a far better budget than doomster predictions. But there should have been a political rolling out of the red carpet in advance to announce a redder budget than expected. Those with least got most: £900 more per year for 2.4 million peopleon the minimum wage. Prescriptions and fuel duty are frozen, frozen rail fares will save commutersaround £300a year. Energy bills are eased by taking the green levies back to the Treasury. It was high time to restore a little justice by taxing properties worth more than £2m. But, yes, the freezing of income tax thresholds amounts to the income tax rise that was pledged against. May all other future chancellors learn from Rachel Reeves’s original great sin, binding herself in iron fiscal chains. Never again.Labour’s enemies will of course ferociously tear all this apart. How the opposite benches howled down abolishing the benefit cap. Alas, this dissent is backed by a majority of the public, who think scroungers have babies-on-benefits. Not so – all evidence shows it hasminimal effecton birth rate. But this is a country mainly nurtured through the years on mean-minded Toryism. A Labour government now and then, with Labour budgets, reminds us that there is a better Britain that can do good. Not enough, not brave or radical enough. I don’t know if this will help reverse Labour’s desperate political misfortunes, but it should at least remind people who have lost trust what Labour governments are for.I’ll say it: this budget didn’t hit the rich hard enoughJulia DaviesMillionaire investor, lawyer and a member of Patriotic MillionairesFirst and foremost, it is wrong to ask working people to contribute more throughfreezing income tax thresholds, while the wealthiest in society are broadly left untouched. In a country with such extraordinary levels of wealthat the very top, the government should be looking to those most able to contribute more, not turning to those who are already doing their part.The additional council tax surcharge on homes worth more than £2m and higher rates on investment income show a limited willingness to move in the right direction. These steps are far too small to make any real impact on thelevels of inequalitywe are expected to tolerate. This lack of ambition on taxing the super-rich does not meet the needs of the moment. Instead, it shifts yet more pressure on to everyone else.If the government chooses to reverse course on today’s decisions, there is still time to create a tax system that works for everyone. What our country needs is determination, will and clarity of purpose from our political leaders to deliver an economy that works for all of us, not just people like me.The members of Patriotic Millionaires and I will continue to push our government for ambitious economic reform. The UK cannot afford any further piecemeal approach to the economy. While an annual wealth tax is not a panacea, it signals the kind of change required to put people first and address deep-rooted inequality. There is still time in this parliament to achieve this.A ‘mansion tax’ sounds good, but it’s not the reform we needAbi O'ConnorUrban sociologist and honorary fellow at the University of LiverpoolOur housing system is a key driver of the gap between rich and poor in society. This is becausecouncil tax bandshave not been recalibrated since 1991. Retaining this system reinforces regional inequality and ensures the most expensive homes are chronically undertaxed.While increasing council tax on homes worth more than £2m is a small step in the right direction from this government, it lacks the ambition the country was promised. Genuine reform could be achieved bysimply implementingproportional property tax, in which every home’s tax rate is set annually in line with its actual market value.It is right that the wealthiest pay more, and it is right that unearned wealth via assets such as property is taxed appropriately, yet this watered-down “mansion tax” alone will raise only a tiny sum (£400m), and not before 2028. We need a wholesale re-evaluation of how all property is taxed. This will be foundational to rebalancing the housing system and raising public money, therefore today’s announcement is a deflection from the fundamental issue: our inherently regressive council tax system.If this is a tax-raising budget guided by Labour values, why has it shied away from a widely accepted reform that would raise significant finance and address a key driver of inequality?Unfortunately, this budget is emblematic of Labour’s parliament thus far: mired with missed opportunities. This government is clutching at straws because it lacks the courage to tax the wealthiest adequately, and the conviction to properly support the millions struggling to pay their rent and bills.Where’s the offer for young people?Jason OkundayeAssistant newsletter editor and writer at the GuardianFor years now, young people have said they feel overlooked by the government’s spending priorities, and this budget is no exception. Announcements of an above-inflation 4.8% increase in the state pension have been paired with a £2,000 per year cap on national insurance-free salary sacrifice schemes for those saving for a pension. This is particularly unfair for middle-income young people, as their prudent financial planning is turned into another opportunity for a tax raid – and with fears that we are unlikely to see the same state pension as boomers when we retire, we will be even more dependent on these private pots. A freeze on tax thresholds becomes a tax-by-stealth. Even minimum wage increases for 18– to 20-year-olds are portended by the Resolution Foundation asdriving unemployment, at a time whennearly a millionyoung people are economically inactive.Further,reforms to the Isa allowancefor under-65s, with £8,000 of the £20,000 now designated for special stocks-and-shares Isa options, will surely restrict savings for the future. It is right to address the low rates of retail investment and encourage engagement with the stock market, but with young people having grown up under the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis and Covid, and with the threat of the AI bubble bursting, they should be able to commit the full amount to fixed-rate, low-risk accounts if they wish.These may feel like only the concerns of a high-income fraction, but in the absence of packaged offers for young people, the narrative that emerges is one of a broken social contract. Highly educated middle-earners and Henrys (high earners, not rich yet) ask where the promised reward of stability is after pursuing competitive degrees and intense jobs, while growing resentful at others they believe are getting a free ride (see the popular “Nicolas, 30 ans” meme). And if this golden ticket of education and work is false, then why not forgo it and try to get rich quick with crypto?I believe in progressive taxation, and as a childless gen Z I am happy for my taxes to go to breakfast clubs and lifting the two-child benefit cap. But the lack of concessions for young workers is invariably driving some others to the right, who direct their angst towards recipients of welfare, social housing occupants, migrants and pensioners.Pensioner povertyis a real issue, yet the image of cruise-taking over-65s funded by the young dominates.The UK has plenty of taxes – what are we getting for all this new spending?John RedwoodConservative MP for Wokingham from 1987 to 2024The budget is bad for industry, bad for jobs, bad for young people trying to get a start in life and find an affordable home, bad for savings and investment and bad for growth. Allowing a two-month run-in with scare stories about every kind of tax rise hit confidence. It stopped some businesses offering new jobs and committing to new investments. The shadow of the first disastrousbudgetloomed over the country as we saw for ourselves unemploymentrise, job vacanciesfall, inflation go up and growth stumble to nothing as the budget measures hit home.This time the chancellor was ready with her excuses. She has latched on to the misleading Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of a4% hit to UK GDPfrom Brexit, meant to occur over a 15-year period. We know this was wrong as UK GDP growthoutperformedmajor EU countries such as France and Germany in many of the post-referendum years. Reeves seeks to assist a PM who thinks we should spend large sums on joining EU projects, including a preposterous £5bn to allow companies to bid for defence contracts, contrary to world trade rules. Why not spend the money on buying UK weapons for our own military?The UK is not short of taxes. The government plans to spend £185bn more next year than in the last full year under the Conservatives. What will we get for all that cash? How much of it is going on more illegal migrants and low pay, or no-pay legal migrants and their hotel and housing needs? How much on the huge losses of the Bank of England? How much on needlessly giving away theChagos islands?More taxes will do us harm and encourage even more talented and wealthy people to leave. Some of the tax rises will cost us dear as those who could pay decide not to, avoiding taxes by leaving or by spending and investing less. The biggest losers are young people less likely to get a job or be able to afford a home of their own.Taking green policy costs off household bills is a good first stepSarah NankivellDeputy director of Common WealthLabour entered government suggesting that action on the climate would take care of the cost of living,almost automatically. It has rightly responded to rising anxieties around the latter by prioritising immediaterelief to bills, while resisting the equally simplistic notion that net zero will cost households more. But room still remains to reduce the tension and maximise the complementarity.Successive governments’ resistance to tax rises has made electricity bills the vessel forgreen policy leviesthat could be funded through progressive general taxation. Moving these levies off bills is an important landmark – these policies have driven up electricity costs since the pandemic and made electricity structurally more expensive than gas. This precedent must be built upon.The budget’s announcements reaffirm the assumption that lower bills in the short term are only achievable by shifting costs from households to government while leaving the source of those costs unchanged. In particular, the energy companies, whose “renewables obligation” subsidies will now be majority-funded by government, have been enjoying handsome windfalls. In the meantime, the public are told to wait for new renewables to gradually reduce market prices.Another green levy removed from bills is theenergy company obligationthat funded part of the warm homes plan to reduce future demand. The plan is intended to help people with energy efficiency and insulation upgrades, so much will depend on how this is rolled out and whether it is adequately resourced.Ultimately the transition demands a scale of investment beyond existing commitments. Surging military spending redirects scarce manufacturing capacity away from technologies needed for the energy transition. The choice to sign up to Nato’s arbitrary 5% target – which Stockholm International Peace Research Institute suggests would mean finding an extra £136bn per year by 2035–shows that fiscal rules can be bent and bond markets resisted when government decides.On tax, Reeves chose ad hoc revenue grabs over big changesAndy SummersDirector of the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation and associate professor at London School of Economics and Political Science Law SchoolThis may feel like a “big budget” of tax reforms, but that’s only because successive governments have done so little in the way of serious reform that we’ve forgotten what it looks like. Overall, the tax changes announced today are unlikely to move the needle on growth much one way or the other.There is still no sense that the government has a vision for a good tax system, let alone a strategy for getting there. In this climate, the risk is that even moves in the right direction – such as on council tax – still come across as ad hoc revenue-grabs rather than principled efforts to make the tax system fairer and more efficient.For a government that’s supposedly obsessed with growth, we seem no closer to the realisation that our broken tax system is part of the UK’s growth problem, and that major structural reforms – not just rate-changes or more bolt-ons – are needed to fix it.A strategy for pro-growth tax reforms is already out there and ready to be picked up. Recently,authors from CenTax and eight other thinktanksfrom across the political spectrum declared agreement on the way ahead. It’s regrettable that this budget contains barely a hint of progress against any of the seven reform packages we proposed.For instance, reforming capital gains tax to provide a pro-growth investment allowance, alongside equalising the rate with income tax. And abolition of stamp duty alongside a full reform of council tax.Outside government, the need for serious tax reform is universally accepted and there is remarkable agreement over how to do it. We must turn our attention to the reasons why successive governments have failed to deliver, despite this consensus. It would be wise to start thinking about this now, because 10 weeks out from the next budget will be too late.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025The panelTax and spendingEconomic policyEconomicsTaxEconomic growth (GDP)commentShareReuse this content"

Poll ratings are down the U-bend; backbenchers are mutinous and colleagues are circling around the prime minister, readying themselves to land the fatal blow. You have a budget, which may be your last chance to avert the inevitable. What do you do?If you’re Rachel Reeves, youuse it to buy time. Time for Keir Starmer and you to carry on in office for a while longer, so perhaps your luck will change. Extra time for this unfortunate, empty, placeholder of a PM costs more than olive oil, but the chancellor still splashed out. This afternoon, she delivered a budget that was a £26bn attempt to buy her government some time.That £26bn will be paid not by businesses but by you and me, as taxes are pushed up to an all-time high. She will spend the cash to placate bond investors and calm down angry backbenchers by increasing the “headroom” to meet her own fiscal rules, and on measures such as scrapping thetwo-child benefit cap. And it will work, for a while. But even while many of those moves are good, they are small. Bundle up all the spending and tax policies and the budget is huge, but look at the measures one by one and they are mainly loose change. You can say the same about the likely impact of this budget.A little breather, yes – enough for this historically unpopular pair to stay in Downing Street a while longer. But a gamechanger? No. When the public judge Starmer and Reeves as worse than the calamity couple ofLiz TrussandKwasi Kwarteng, then however unfair the situation, it’s beyond saving.Such desperation has marked this budget from the start, through all the leaks and bungling. A “circus” is how the Bank of England’s former chief economist Andy Haldanedescribes it– and that was before some poor sod at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)had an off-day. Except circuses are meant to be fun. All this speculation has achieved has been to put businesses off investing and crushed growth, as even the Bank murmurs discreetly in itslatest monetary policy report.Governments use budgets to set an agenda, tell a story, pick a side. Remember Gordon Brown and his crusade to end child poverty, which he very nearly won. Think of George Osborne and his drive to squeeze public services and social security. Years before he brought in the loathsome child-benefit cap, David Cameron was arguing for it. Then look at our first female chancellor, obviously gifted andLabourto her fingertips, but unable to show us why. Why she’s in No 11, what she wants to do with power, or even with this budget.The brutal truth, as theJoseph Rowntree Foundation observes, is that the vast majority of the taxes raised today will go on padding out the margin to meet her fiscal rules. Another slug will be spent on paying for all those U-turns forced on Reeves and Starmer. Only 20% will go on new measures “actually making people better off”.What a way to waste a landslide majority. Small measures to improve voters’ lives – cutting energy bills, freezing train fares and prescription charges – will barely be noticed against a backdrop of rising bills (especially for food) and flat wages. Almost a million workers will be dragged into the 40% higher tax band by the end of this year, even while public services continue to struggle. For all the extra billions that have gone to Wes Streeting, it’s not enough to make up the lag at the NHS: 22% of patients wait more than six weeks for diagnostic tests,MPs reported recently. The standard is meant to be 1%. The MPs expressed “significant concerns” that the shake-up of NHS England “has been announced without either delivery plans or funding in place”.If you are already worrying about the prospect of 2029 bringing Nigel Farage into No 10, then look at the finding from the OBR on how household take-home pay will rise over the rest of this decade. Because it will barely rise at all: just 0.25% a year every year until the general election. That is what a cost of living crisis looks like – but it’s also how a political breakdown takes hold. It’s well down even on the 2010s, the rage-filled decade that gave us Brexit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To gee up the Labour base, she promised an end to austerity. To win over Tories, she pledged that none of the big three taxes would go up. And to make peace with financial markets, she tied herself up with fiscal rules that are simply too tight. As I and a few others argued at the time, these three goals are incompatible. To deliver capital-C change you need to raise revenue or borrow. Most of all, you need to level with voters and tell them that without this money, their kids’ classrooms will continue to leak and their parents will wait for ever to get their cataracts done. Labour never came clean. It blustered about growth, then broke its manifesto promise by hitting employers with a rise in national insurance. Wednesday’s big stealth rise in taxes breaks its promises again.And for what? To save its skin. The very regime adopted by Reeves to ensure stability – relying on the OBR despite poor forecasts and productivity downgrades, tying herself into tight fiscal rules – is a large part of why this government is so unstable. And Westminster turbulence will roil financial markets. Asset managers are already sending out slide decks giving their views on which of the possible replacements for Starmer in No 10 will be best for gilt investors. Andy Burnham, who warned of a government “in hock” to bond markets, is not viewed too highly, you won’t be surprised to learn. Rather more sobering is the implication that financial markets, while paying no party subs and wielding no votes, will have a say in choosing this country’s next prime minister.But all that is not a question for this week – and for that Starmer should thank Reeves, who has probably done enough to stave off an imminent collapse. For now.You can call this budget The One Where Rachel Buys Time but, as the old song goes, it’s always later than you think. I’ll be around for years and years, Reeves told Labour MPs this week.

On one hand, it said no new licences “to explore new fields” would be granted. On the other, it said existing fields would be managed “for the entirety of their lifespan” in a way “that does not jeopardise jobs”.The formulation raised many questions. Where, exactly, would the line be drawn between a new field and an existing field? What would be the approach to protecting workers when, as now, North Sea jobs are estimated to be going at a rate of 1,000 a month according to analysis by Robert Gordon University?The thinking is only slightly easier to understand now. The clear part is that Ed Miliband’s energy security and net zero departmentwill create “transitional energy certificates”for “limited” oil and gas drilling in areas that are part of an existing field or adjacent to a licensed field. The idea is to keep those sites economically viable for longer by using existing rigs and pipelines.The approach sounds sensibly practical. The UK’s current reliance on imported oil and gas is doing little to reduce emissions (shipments of liquefied gas from the US and Qatarare far more polluting than domestic production) or protect jobs in a supply chain that will be needed to build renewables infrastructure.North Sea plan allows drilling while enabling Labour to keep ‘no new licences’ pledgeRead moreThe risk in not allowing “tiebacks” is that decline in the North Sea accelerates even faster at a time when oil and gas still provides three-quarters of the UK’s energy needs and imports are running at 40%. Miliband has proved to be more pragmatic on licensing than his industry critics made out. And, yes, his policy reads as manifesto-compliant.But here’s the rub: the chancellor didn’t budge an inch on the windfall tax, the energy profits levy (EPL) introduced during the price spikes of 2022. The Treasury intends to keep the EPL in place until its scheduled end in 2030.Oil and gas companiessay the levy is the real reason they’re cutting investment: the UK is simply uncompetitive when the marginal rate of tax in the North Sea is 78% and 2022’s sky-high prices for oil and gas have reversed.“If the levy stays in place beyond 2026, projects will stall and jobs will vanish, no matter how pragmatic licensing policy becomes,” argued the trade lobby group Offshore Energies UK.One could take the view that the industry is exaggerating and that producers in practice will leap at the chance to get their hands on tieback licences, perhaps in the expectation that the EPL will disappear early anyway when oil and gas prices fall far enough to trigger automatic cut-offs (the oil price is there already, but both have to happen for six months). Well, maybe – but that prospect is obviously highly uncertain.The position therefore is a muddle of a different type. The energy department’s looser licensing regime and the Treasury’s tight tax policy are pulling in opposite directions. It makes it hard to understand what the government is trying to achieve. Certainly, nobody is talking about actual production targets for the North Sea, which you’d think would be a basic requirement of a“fair, managed and prosperous” strategy for transition. The thinking does not look joined-up.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I Love LA, theHBO comedyset among wannabe gen Z influencers, is only halfway through its eight-episode run, but it is already comfortably the best show of the year. And more importantly, it has triggered all the signifiers of event TV: obsessive repeat viewings, line-by-line coverage,big platform profilesof its stars andweekly recapson Vulture, New York magazine’s website. Within days of each episode airing, people havetranscribed and uploadedthe entire script, which – with the best will in the world – no one’s doing forRiot Women.The surprising thing about this is not the fact that it’s the first show by Rachel Sennott, the show’s 30-year-old creator and star, or that the action takes place in a tiny world in east LA, but that content about influencers can be watchable at all. To date, millennial and older writers have tended to use social media as a lumbering plot device – oh my God, something’s gone “viral!” – or as a stand-in for the collapse of all known standards. You probably haven’t watched these because nobody did, but take your pick from: HBO’s one-season disasterThe Girls on the Bus, in which an old-media reporter covers a US election race only to find that influencers – those pesky kids! – have stolen her patch. Or the equally horrific Netflix flopGirlboss, loosely based on the memoirs of Sophia Amoruso, the early influencer, and which not even a cameo by Cole Escola could save. Or Flack, the deathly Anna Paquin-fronted show about publicists trying to manage their clients’ social media, and an early red flag for which was the use of the word “maven” in the show’s publicity.Sennott’s elevator pitch for I Love LA was “Entourage for internet girls”, and unlike those other shows, she’s writing from inside the house: the series is based on her move from New York to LA in 2020 and her years of being young, broke and striving in a lonely and competitive city.View image in fullscreenRachel Sennott in I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/SKY ComedyAs such, I Love LA is as current as Girls was in 2012 and tells the story of Maia, a new-hire entertainment manager trying to wrangle her old pal and only client, Tallulah, into taking off as an influencer, while hanging out with Charlie, an uber-gay stylist, and the nepo baby Alani, played deliciously by real nepo baby True Whitaker (daughter of Forest). The success of the show isn’t only about youth. At the risk of sounding likeTina Brown’s Substack, while there is definite buzz around the age of the show’s creator and actors and the fact that it feels like the first really authentic gen Z comedy, the show is as much about sensibility. I would say I Love LA has more in common with Platonic, thehit show about middle ageon Apple TV+, than with much younger pieces. (There’s a great joke about Cara Delevingne in the Platonic pilot that could easily sit in the new HBO show.)And I Love LA has almost certainly benefited from the sheer amount of garbage on TV at the moment. That one with Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys, in which her chin wobble carries most of the drama and both their managers should’ve had a word about lighting (Rhys looks like the waxwork of a deposed dictator.) Or the new one withDavid Duchovny– if you got further than 10 minutes in, I commend you. Reviews for I Love LA haven’t been universally good; plenty of people point out that it takes a minute to find its footing. But it is so fresh and real that it makes even recent hits like Hacks look stagey and sitcom.Ultimately, it’s a question of confidence, and the show assumes you will catch the references to Diddy, understand whyKramer vs Kramer is funny, field the drive-by on the LA fires, and appreciate the comedic truth of, “What am I supposed to do, wait in line like an assistant at UTA?” The show occupies a world that the creators also live in and don’t feel inclined to explain. If youdon’t get the line“I just wasted $612 on a straight fire victim queer-baiter,” then I Love LA invites you, politely, to return to the tepid pleasures of shows about women who hate their husbands and wonder if they’re living the wrong life (almost certainly, yes).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not me. But what to say when asked by a teenager about a career in the media? With tens of thousands of media, journalism and other graduates crowding into the market every year, the chances of finding steady work, let alone stardom, are more remote than ever. There’s no advice I feel comfortable giving. Too often, I suck my teeth and tell them how hard it is, which surely invites them to wonder exactly how hard it can be if I’ve managed to pull it off. Fair point. But what’s the point encouraging them to chase something that probably isn’t there? Dispiriting.Dispiriting too, when you encounter the opposite of a teenage dreamer: the teenage realist. A few years ago, I was being shown around a secondary school in the Black Country with various worthies. A venerable member of the Cadbury family was in our group. Tremendously tall, stooping to hear what was said, he was kind and attentive, but not of a breed recognisable to any of the kids around us. Undaunted, the head boy led our group with some aplomb. He was but 16 – the school didn’t have a sixth form. He talked to us about the school in a mature, intelligent manner, but without a trace of precocity. In his own quiet way, he was quite something. This young man will go far, I thought. With this in mind, I asked him what he wanted to go on to study. He said he was looking at doing drama at a local college.“Oh, do you want to be an actor?”“No, I’d like to be a drama teacher.”I thought this was magnificent. A thousand other potential drama students of his age would have nothing short of stardom on their minds. But a sadness about it niggled away at me too. As someone in the group pointed out, if you can’t dream at the age of 16, then when can you dream?I interviewed Michael Sheen last Saturday. It turns out that when he was 12 years old his talent for football was spotted. A tap on the shoulder from a football scout was something I yearned for at that age but, I’m sorry to report, no scout ever gave me a second look. It was Arsenal, no less, who were keen to recruit the young, football-obsessed Michael. The club wanted him, perhaps the whole family, to leave Port Talbot in Wales for London. This they didn’t want to do, which is something he was later grateful for, reasoning that his chance of making it would have been so slim. And so it was that instead he ended up shooting for success in that famously accessible and secure line of work – acting.I must ask a bookmaker some time to give me the odds on a teenager making it in the fields of a) football b) acting and c) television presenting. Those odds will be long indeed, absurdly long. So long, in fact, that any young person making that bet on themselves is plainly mad and to be discouraged. But, talking to Michael, I had a couple of thoughts, not least that if I’d been at his school, with him excelling at football and acting and probably more besides, he’d have got right on my wick.But it also struck me that our cultural lives would be nothing without those who were once teenage dreamers. When it comes down to it, the athletes, musicians, writers and actors we so admire are all people who once made absurdly speculative long-shot bets on themselves to succeed, ignoring any and all sensible advice to wise up, get real and look for proper jobs instead. So let us salute the dreamers, the deluded shooters for the stars. For without them, the world would be a bare place indeed.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleOpinionYoung peopleCareerscommentShareReuse this content"

Despite their highly publicised separation from the royal family, Harry and Meghan remain extraordinarily loyal to their fancy titles. They have been asked before why they cling to their aristocratic honorifics and shrugged off the question. “What difference would that make?” Harry toldAnderson Cooper in 2023, when asked why the couple didn’t renounce the titles.The difference, Mr Duke, is that people might stop wondering why you and Megs are so keen on reminding everyone that you’re royals, while living in a country that famously has no monarchy. And this question isn’t going away. It keeps popping up and it’s back in the news now thanks to aHarper’s Bazaarcover story on Meghan.“After years of being subsumed by other people’s narratives, the Duchess of Sussex is ready to author her own next chapter,” the profile proclaims. And then a little detail that has taken the internet by storm. The magazine writer enters the luxury New York home of one of Meghan’s friends and notes: “The house manager announces, ‘Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,’ even though we appear to be the only other two people in the house.” The woman so keen on authoring her own next chapter apparently continues to insist on being called by a title she received via marriage from an institution she seems to disdain.Before all the Meghan fans come rushing in ready to fight: yes, the duchess was given a terrible time by the royals and the British press. But two things can be true at once: one can acknowledge that Meghan was treated poorly while also noting that she and Harry seem awfully keen to enjoy all the privileges of royalty, without many of the responsibilities.This seems to be a theme with the Sussexes. The Harper’s Bazaar profile explains the reason Meghan was at her friend’s New York pad for that interview was that she and Harry were in the city to receive theHumanitarians of the Yearaward from a mental health not-for-profit organisation. Have the pair done good work raising awareness about important issues? Sure. Do they deserve to be known as “humanitarians of the year” when there are large numbers of underpaid and underappreciated humanitarian workers risking their lives in war zones? No, they don’t. And this is why so many people have a problem with the Sussexes. Because they seem obsessed with titles and accolades without putting in the grunt work that normally goes along with them. I can think of a few words for people like that – and it’s not “duchess” or “duke”.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It was what I can only describe as a kind of corporeal attack, an existential clutch followed by days of such powerful anxiety my body was taken in bouts of uncontrollable shaking. A sense of not mattering, a virulent dread and dissolving into an all-encompassing nothingness impossible to shake. How many times as a child, after being abused by my father, had I experienced this sense of erasure and disappearance?Feeling that no matter what I did, what I accomplished, how hard I tried to lift my head above the parapet I would be cast out forever. This attack lasted days. Perhaps it was Virginia’s story, parts of which felt much like my own. Raped as a child by her father, then raped by her father’s good friend, then raped when she ran away, then the years of being raped byGhislaine MaxwellandJeffrey Epstein, then being sexually trafficked to powerful and sadistic men to be raped again.Perhaps it was knowing that after years of working, educating the public about the impact of sexual abuse, the world refused to understand the depth of its consequences. That once you are raped, once your body is taken against your will, once you are invaded and dominated your body ceases to be your own. You become a thing, what Virginia called a toy, to be used and abused and tossed and discarded.Then the press, repeating infuriating, ignorant questions and notions: “Why didn’t she leave? No one was forcing her to stay. She could have walked away at any time. She was 16. She wasn’t eight. She clearly stayed for the money.” Still not understanding or perhaps refusing to understand that once you have been raped, self-love and self-agency or even the belief that you and your body are worth saving, have been decimated. That because you were forced to separate from your own body at the moment of invasion, you have essentially become a dehumanized object no longer worthy of protection. You are lost, a walking ghost in a permanent fog with no real ability to fight for yourself.And once you have been raped you have an aura, a stamp of brokenness that until you have begun to heal, constantly attracts more abusers who can smell your vulnerability and do their best to exploit it. It is clear in all the reports coming out that Epstein and Maxwell conducted interviews with each young woman to assess the degree of this brokenness and exploitability. Or maybe the attack was brought on by living in America, a country currently led by a president, anadjudicated rapist, a man who openly hates women, living in a zone caught in a childhood sexual abuse seizure.Months, even years of survivors bravely telling their stories, pressing charges, in hopes of getting accountability and justice and instead being gaslit, degraded, threatened and disbelieved. A zone devoted for years to protecting an international ring of the powerful men, all of them either rapists or pedophiles or willing to associate with them without concern or outrage.The attack on my body was still shocking. Here, at 72, some 66 years after my own abuse, after years of work attempting to heal through every kind of therapy trying to transform my being from a colonized entity, an invaded landscape a field of rubble. All those years of dedicated work and still this rape lives in my cells, lived in the cells of Virginia, in the collective cells of millions, actually a billion women survivors who attempt to live every day, struggling their way out of darkness.Rape is betrayal, invasion and theft. It murders the life force of the victim. Like plutonium it lodges itself forever in the chemistry of the bodyWe have names for it, sure – PTSD, recurring trauma or some diagnosis that often renders survivors insane. But the truth is survivors can read the room. They can surmise from the lack of care, accountability and justice that their anxiety is based in reality, a landscape where not only is there no safety or protection but where underground rings of sex trafficking emerge each day.So let me try for the millionth time to explain. Maybe you will open your hearts. Maybe you will dig deep into yourself to try to have empathy and understanding, Rape is betrayal, invasion and theft. It murders the life force of the victim. Like plutonium it lodges itself forever in the chemistry of the body. It robs us of sleep, trust, our ability to be intimate. It destroys self-esteem. It distorts our desire.For almost 60 years I have tried to understand what pleasure, what satisfaction any man or woman could take in ripping apart a child or a woman’s body against her will.Where does such hate come from, such disregard? There are many theories – men’s rage at their mothers for their dependency, the jealous need to destroy life force, innocence and beauty, the simple unchecked trajectory of men’s need for conquest and dominance.Whatever the causes, what matters now is how we stop this rampant insane abuse. Sex trafficking is a $200bn international industry. We are living in a world, as Manon Garcia describes in her new masterpiece about the Pelicot trials, Living with Men, constructed by “a scaffolding of rape”.Jeffrey Epstein’s emails reveal a disdain for morality among the elite | Moira DoneganRead moreVirginia says near the end of her book:“I’m learning to accept that sometimes I will simply not be okay. That is the process of serious trauma. It lays you low and sometimes makes you your own worst enemy. My goal is to prevent the emotional time bomb that lives inside me – my toxic memories and devastating visualizations of myself being hurt – from every detonating again.” Tragically the last explosion took her life.But there is another timebomb about to explode and it will if there is no accountability or justice for the Epstein victims. This time it will be directed outward. It will be the alchemized rage of millions of survivors, who have had enough, who cannot and will not live a day longer with this torturous injustice.V (formerly Eve Ensler) is a playwright and activist and the founder of V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women and girlsInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Nicolas Guillou cannot shop online. When he used Expedia to book a hotel in his own country, the reservation was cancelled within hours. He is “blacklisted by much of the world’s banking system”, unable to use most bank cards.Guillou, you see, has been sanctioned by the United States, putting him on a15,000-strong listalongside al-Qaida terrorists, drug cartels and Vladimir Putin. Why? Because alongside two other judges of the international criminal court pre-trial chamber I, he approved arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and Mohammed Deif, the former commander of Hamas’s military wing. Guillou and his colleagues had “actively engaged in the ICC’s illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel”,the US claimedwhen imposing the sanctions in June. All are now barred from entering the US – but that is the least of the consequences.The rationale is brutally clear. The rule of law does not apply to the world’s hegemon or its closest allies. This was bluntly spelled out by Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who told the ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan – himself sanctioned –that the ICCwas “made for Africa and thugs like Putin, not democracies like Israel”. The US refused to sign up to the court, clearly fearing that its propensity to commit war crimes in foreign lands would lead to prosecutions. That put Washington in the same bracket as human rights abusers like China, Russia and indeed Israel. Only because Palestine acceded to the court a decade ago does the ICC now have jurisdiction over crimes committed on its territory or by its citizens.Guillou and his colleagues issued their warrants after a lengthy, cautious legal process. The case against the Israeli politicians focused on the use of starvation, which Israeli leaders routinely confessed to. Gallant had announced “a complete siege on the Gaza Strip” on the grounds Israel was fighting “human animals”, whileNetanyahu declared: “We will not allow humanitarian assistance in the form of food and medicines from our territory to the Gaza Strip.”In spring 2024, two US government agencies concluded that Israel was deliberately blocking humanitarian aid – an assessment that, according to US legislation, required halting all arms transfers. The US government disregarded its own law.The obliteration of Gaza, the indiscriminate killing of its people, the systematic targeting of civilian infrastructure – we could go on – has led to a consensus among genocide scholars that Israel is committing genocide. But for the US and its allies, maintaining Israel’s impunity matters more than preserving any semblance of an international order. Nearly four decades ago, the then senatorJoe Biden told Congressthat Israel was “the best $3bn investment we make”, claiming that “were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interest in the region”. The US regards Israel as an indispensable strategic asset, which is why it is the biggest ever recipient ofUS foreign aid, including military assistance. Washington will keep supplying the weapons that enable Israeli war crimes – and then threaten anyone who tries to hold the perpetrators to account.Other western countries have followed the US lead. Italy is an ICC member state, butdecided to undermine the courtby reassuring Netanyahu he would not face arrest if he visited.So did France, and it has since failed to stand up for one of its own citizens for fulfilling his legal responsibilities, while serving an international institution France helped to found.

Whatever remained of that political tradition lies buried in Gaza’s pulverised landscape. Much of the world has witnessed Israel’s daily atrocities against the Palestinian people – including in the US itself,where half the populationthink genocide was committed, with only a little over a third denying it. Who will ever again accept western lectures on human rights or the “rules-based order”?Time and again, western disdain for international law has rebounded as a strategic disaster. After the Soviet Union collapsed, US elites persuaded themselves that American military power was unchallengeable. That belief helped unleash the illegal invasion of Iraq, which destroyed Washington’s aura of unbeatable strength and shredded the west’s supposed moral authority. The contempt for international law displayed in Iraq helpedclear the pathfor Putin’s later aggression against Ukraine. In Afghanistan,the war crimescommitted by US-led forces stoked resentment which resuscitated the Taliban, ending in shattering military and strategic humiliation.The international legal system was always tilted in the west’s favour. That South Africa dared to accuse a key western ally of genocide at the international court of justice tells its own story, as does the support it received from much of the global south and European states such as Spain. The same logic applies to the ICC, which many western states assumed would be used only against their enemies or powerless nations. That this assumption no longer holds is itself a measure of western decline. Waging a campaign against judges who apply the law consistently will not arrest that fall. It will accelerate it. The west’s own hubris sent its power into freefall in the 21st century. There is still a long way down.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Scrapping thetwo‑child benefit cap, putting upgambling taxes, freezing rail fares and implementing a mansion tax are not just sensible moves – they are long overdue. As is a “managed transition” for the North Sea that supports workers while pivoting to clean energy, without abruptly ditching oil and gas. The country will be a better, fairer place for these measures. They should also assuage backbench anger over self-inflicted damage by thechancellor’s proposed welfare cutsand secure Ms Reeves’s position – for now.The dilemma at the heart of Ms Reeves’s fiscal strategy is that while individual policies may be progressive, the economic framework they sit inside is not. This is exposed by theOffice for Budget Responsibility.Behind the signature policies lies a deeply conservative macro strategy. The budget will see£26bn in tax risesborne heavily by workers, falling investment, stagnant growth, flat wages and a fiscal debt rule met on a coin toss. The OBR warns that under Ms Reeves’s spending plans, unprotected services – councils, courts and police – will face Osborne-style cuts of 3.3% a year from 2029 to 2031 unless the Treasury finds £21bn extra. Her fiscal rule makes those cuts inevitable.This is at odds with the rosy picture painted by theTreasury, which reckons cuts bring growth. Having declared growth its “central mission” it then admits GDP will inch forward at just 1.5% a year. All of this is made worse by the drag from Brexit, which continues to depress trade and investment. The glaring gap between the OBR’s pessimism and the Treasury’s optimism cannot be ignored. So in the name of “policy certainty”, Ms Reeves will cutOBR scrutiny in halfby reducing checks to one a year. Nothing says stability like fewer people checking the maths.In this budget Labour MPs get their headlines. The Treasury gets its cuts. And the public gets more stagnation. The lesson should be to change course. Both theJoseph Rowntree Foundationand theNew Economics Foundationfocus on fairer fiscal policies, with the latter arguing for Ms Reeves to raise capital gains tax to the same rate as income tax. If Labour wants fairness, it must properly tax wealth, not just work. Frozen fuel duty is an idea well past its sell-by date. The OBR isblunt: cut the prices the state controls, like energy bills, and inflation falls – undermining the Treasury’s story.None of this negates the real gains for children and struggling families. These interventions matter: lifting the two-child cap will see 350,000 children pulled out of poverty. Transforming the life chances of the poorest should be the reason for aLabourgovernment. It is welcome that ministers have recognised that rescuing public services and easing the cost of living is necessary. Whoever is chancellor in two years can accelerate this shift.The OBR has already given the game away: Ms Reeves’s numbers implypolitically impossible cuts, and Labour will inevitably spend more cash at the next spending review. The system is now engineered so that the Treasury can “find” the money by revising up growth – conveniently without the OBR around to question the sleight of hand. But perhaps this reveals what Westminster often ignores: thatmoney is political. Thestate can create fiscal spacewhenever it chooses, and the economy will revive when it spends. Stagnation ends when the government stops starving the system.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionRachel ReevesLabourBenefitsMansion taxOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomic policyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

One plausible merit of an appointed chamber is that specialists might be recruited to apply non-political expertise in legislative scrutiny. Appointees are certainly not supposed to use their privileged position to advance the interests of paying clients.After aGuardian investigation, two peers were disciplined this week for breakinglobbying rules. Lord Dannatt, a former head of the British army who served as a crossbencher, and Lord Evans of Watford, a businessman and Labour peer, have been suspended for four and five months respectively. Both men were recorded by undercover Guardian reporters posing as property developers, discussing ways in which their Westminster contacts might be useful to advance potential clients’ access.The code of conduct for peers forbids the provision of parliamentary services for “payment or reward”. In a subsequent investigation, the Lords standards commissioner identified breaches by both men. Lord Dannatt had corresponded with ministers and officials about companies in which he held a financial interest. Lord Evans had sponsored events in parliament for a company owned by his son in which he had shares.These are unlikely to be exceptional cases. The upper chamber is overpopulated, poorly scrutinised and full of seasoned political operators, including party donors. It isculturally predisposedto scandals of this nature. It has more than 800 members. They are not salaried but claim a tax-free daily allowance of £371, plus expenses, payable regardless of how meaningfully they participate in the legislative process.In the 2019-24 parliament, 10% of peers accounted for more than half of contributions to the chamber. Multiple outside interests are normal.Too many peers treat the Palace of Westminster as little more than an exclusive members’ club, enjoying the status for its own sake or for the networking opportunities. Monetising the latter is easy, as this newspaper’s investigations have shown.Lobbying scandals are not confined to the Lords. Anyone with credible access to corridors of power is a potential target for businesses and other interests hoping to short-circuit formal channels of consultation. It is not illegal for a company to want to get a point of view across to a minister, nor is it necessarily unethical for former politicians to apply their experience as consultants. But the loyalty of serving parliamentarians is meant to be to the public. Even just a perception of conflicts of interest corrodes confidence in the political process.Some of these issues can be addressed with tougher regulation and greater transparency. In the Commons, rules around MPs taking paid consultancy work weretightened last year, although second jobs are still permitted. The essentially absurd character of the Lords will always be a problem. Reform was promised in Labour’s manifesto last year, although the ambition has shrunk as the government has been bogged down in other business. A bill to remove the remaining hereditary peers – a preposterous archaism – is, predictably, meeting resistance in the upper house.Any merit in outside experts sitting in the legislature is poor compensation for the lack of accountability in a system that packs the upper chamber with political appointees. Every scandal featuring peers is a reminder that British democracy is incomplete as long as the Lords is unreformed.Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsOpinionLobbyingRichard DannattLaboureditorialsShareReuse this content"

But peers are not playing games with the assisted dying bill; they are finally providing the independentscrutiny it has so far lacked. And the carefully crafted campaign sloganscollapse under examination.Rather than addressing suffering, the bill makes no mention of it – let alone requiring, as most assisted dying laws do, that a person be experiencing suffering that cannot otherwise be relieved. And, rather than respecting autonomy, as the Swiss do, under this bill the state – not the individual – decides the circumstances in which ending your life is acceptable, and makes doctors the agents of that judgment.I’m a doctor who is not opposed to legalising assisted dying. But I cannot support a proposal that would require me to treat a patient saying they want to end their life in a radically different way just because of their life expectancy: more than six months, suicide prevention; six months or less, assessment for a lethal prescription.The real democratic failure lies not in the Lords’ scrutiny but in the private members bill process, which has allowed a single MP – effectively fronting amultimillion‑pound lobbying group and its century‑old model of assisted dying– to advance that anachronistic approach as if it were the only option, blocking consideration ofsafer, more ethically coherent alternatives.Dr Lucy ThomasPalliative caredoctorSimon Jenkins seems to misunderstand the role of theHouse of Lords. It is not there to pat the Commons on the back and wave through their legislation; its role is to scrutinise bills using the knowledge and expertise of the Lords and provide a second layer of analysis. Surely this is extremely important when we are talking about actual life and death?The crossbench peer Tanni Grey-Thompson, who herself has tabled amendments,said on X: “The role of the House of Lords is to debate a bill line by line. The Commons by comparison have amendments and votes selected so sometimes chunks of a bill are not debated.”She and other peers are discussing evidence from the disabled groups, psychiatrists, eating disorder specialists and others whose views were either not selected to be heard in the Commons – where the majority of the committee held pro-assisted dying views – or ignored.Mr Jenkins may lambast the Lords, but many of us say thank goodness for them.Penelope JenkinsKenilworth, WarwickshireI often disagree with Simon Jenkins, but not this time. Seven lords a-leaping do indeed appear to be blocking, not scrutinising, the assisted dying bill. I am one of very many in favour of being granted the right to choose my death at the end of life.It seems that some in the Lords are trying to argue that until palliative care is available to all, assisted dying should not be an option. This is absurd.Assisted dyingand palliative care are not in opposition. Both are necessary and desirable. What is on offer in the bill is actually very limited.The real fear is that access to assisted dying will be so hedged about with permissions from doctors and judges that it will be available only to a few better-off and well-connected members of the middle and upper classes.Margaret PellingOxfordHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I was also in the combined cadet force. The sorts of racist behaviour described in your article were normal (‘Deeply shocking’: Nigel Farage faces fresh claims of racism and antisemitism at school, 18 November).As the child of a refugee from the Nazis, I chose not only to ignore but even to join in with some of the antisemitism, much to my shame these days. It is striking that, with the exception ofChloe Deakin, teachers at the time seem to have viewed Farage’s behaviour as more like “high spirits” or “naughtiness”. Striking, but unsurprising: the private schools which were built to train young Englishmen for empire-building were deeply racist even in the 1980s. Mine had a quota for the maximum number of Jewish pupils. My German teacher routinely, and publicly, humiliated the one Muslim boy in my class.I say this not to defend Farage, but to point out that he – and many others from a similar background – were schooled in an environment that condoned or even encouraged blatant racism, while also equipping the pupils with the swagger, charm and polish to make others feel inferior and admiring of them. To see him in isolation is to miss the nature of the sorts of institutions that educated him, and the damage they do. I’m sure the schools will say they have changed, and I hope they have, but while they continue to educate their pupils to believe they are better than others, there will be plenty more where Farage came from.Name and address suppliedAccusations of racism againstNigel Faragewhile he was a teenager should surprise few people who went to public school in the 1970s. At this time, I attended one of the country’s top public schools, and I constantly witnessed racism. If you were of Jewish, Indian/Pakistani or African origin, you were subject to a daily barrage of abuse. People would shout the Y-word to Jewish pupils, and use the N-word for any person with darker skin. Being an American, I was merely thought of as stupid.We had a mock school election in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister, and the National Front won. Patrick Moore and Enoch Powell were some of the speakers who were welcomed to the school and received much applause for their bile.Richard Gordon HartleySalvador,BrazilHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I am OK with my position. It is not the first time I’ve been in a difficult position but it is about time that we turned it around.”Asked to elaborate on his conversations with the Liverpool hierarchy, the head coach said: “We talk a lot. They are helpful to the team and to me and we have those conversations but they don’t call me every single minute of the day to say they trust me. In the normal conversations we have I feel the trust. But I haven’t spoken to them after this game yet so let’s see.”Slot lamented familiar failings from his Liverpool side in their Champions League defeat, namely missed opportunities and conceding too easily, but the midfielder Curtis Jones was more forthright in his assessment of the club’s predicament.Jones said: “I don’t have the answers. Honestly, I don’t. I’m saying that to everybody. It’s just unacceptable. I don’t even have to wait to think about it. I’m past being angry inside. I’m at the point now where I just don’t have the words. It’s hard because I’m playing for the team I support. I’m a fan, and I’ve seen this club all my life. In a long, long time, I haven’t experienced a Liverpool team going through a period like this with results like these.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An absorbing game that ebbed and flowed throughout had Bayern Munich’s rising teenager Lennart Karl cancel out Jurrien Timber’s opening goal from a corner before substitutes Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli sealed a deserved win for the home side. It maintains their 100% record in theChampions Leagueand sends them top of the table.Harry Kane let it slip in the buildup that scoring against Arsenal gives him “a bit more joy” than any other club. But the England striker with 27 goals for his club to his name this season barely had a sniff as aBayern Munichside that had also won their first four matches in the Champions League group stage and had been unbeaten in 21 previous games this season were taught a lesson. A place in the knockout stages now seems a mere formality.Arsenal 3-1 Bayern Munich: Champions League – live reactionRead moreWhile it was a night to forget for Myles Lewis-Skelly on a rare start as he was given a severe test by 17-year-old Karl and Leandro Trossard limped off injured before half-time, the return of captain Martin Ødegaard from a knee injury that has kept him out for a month was another reason for Mikel Arteta to be cheerful.With every week that passes,Arsenallook more like a winning team and perhaps their manager’s pre-game remark that they remain “in a different universe” to the six-time European champions Bayern, having yet to win this competition, could be consigned to history if they can keep this up.A Premier League showdown with second-placed Chelsea on Sunday will be a further test of their credentials, but at the moment they are passing every test.“We’ve certainly been very, very consistent in the competition. But it’s just the beginning,” said Arteta. “The energy we created in the stadium, what the team transmits, the energy that we bring, the quality we play with. It’s incredible and we have to maintain that because it’s still very early.”Bayern’s gameplan seemed to try to take the sting out of a boisterous home crowd still on a high fromSunday’s evisceration of Tottenham. They dominated possession in the opening 20 minutes as Arsenal were restricted to two attempts from set-pieces that were both flagged offside. There was to be no such reprieve when Timber leaped highest at the near post to head in Bukayo Saka’s corner.Kane admitted grudgingly beforehand that Arsenal have capitalised on the recent proliferation of goals from set-pieces, but Bayern’s defenders were incredibly slow to react as the Dutchman creeped in front of Manuel Neuer to apply the finishing touch.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Jurriën Timber heads home to open the scoring against Bayern.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe goal galvanised Arsenal as the outstanding Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi began to take control in midfield. Bayern were pushed back deeper and one stray pass from Kane was met with hearty jeers.But after Eberechi Eze could not quite get his shot away after exchanging passes with Mikel Merino, Bayern responded with a sucker punch. A raking ball from the back by Joshua Kimmich picked out the run of Serge Gnabry and his touch was perfect for the diminutive Karl – who became Bayern’s youngest goalscorer in this competition last month and has been tipped for a call-up for Germany’s World Cup squad by the former captain Lothar Matthaus –to fire into the net first time.Arsenal seemed shellshocked and they could have found themselves behind had Josip Stanisic not dragged his shot wide when Lewis-Skelly was again caught out of position.There was more bad news for Arsenal when Trossard had to limp off just before the break after receiving treatment. The Belgium forward headed straight down the tunnel and was replaced by Madueke. “He said he felt something, we didn’t want to take any risk,” said Arteta.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We get to show how we react now.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke (centre) scored Arsenal’s second goal from Riccardo Calafiori’s excellent cross.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMerino was inches wide of the target with another header from a corner before Kompany was shown a yellow card for protesting when Dayot Upamecano took out Madueke. The pressure was building.Somehow Saka did not react quickly enough when Neuer saved with his foot to deny a rampaging Rice and an open goal went begging. It took an error from Upamecano to finally restore their lead as he gave the ball straight to Rice and Riccardo Calafiori’s first involvement after coming off the bench was to set up his fellow substitute Madueke for a tap-in.Bayern pressed forward in search of an equaliser. Eze’s long ball caught out Neuer on the halfway line and a clever touch from Martinelli with his thigh to take the ball away from the Bayern goalkeeper set up a simple finish and underline that Arsenal definitely means business this time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalBayern Munichmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There were measures of encouragement for the crucial Premier League home game against Fulham on Saturday, most notably in the shape of Randal Kolo Muani, the striker who is on loan fromParis Saint-Germain.Kolo Muani set up Richarlison for 1-0 and scored with a stinging volley for 2-1. There would be another for him before this wildChampions Leaguetie was over. They were his first in Spurs colours, a reminder to his parent club about his quality. After his move to PSG from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023 for an initial €75m, he endured a difficult 18 months.Arsenal go top as Martinelli puts finishing touch to win against Bayern MunichRead moreThere was nevertheless frustration for Thomas Frank and his Spurs players, namely in how they allowed the initiative to slip, silly errors proving their undoing. Well, that and a guy called Vitinha. PSG’s ludicrously talented midfield controller was the star, finishing with a hat-trick.Vitinha produced a pair of equalisers with long-range shots, the first a real jaw-dropper just before half-time, and it was him that set the seal on it all from the penalty spot. It added up to a fourth win out of five in the competition for the holders, even if there was an unwanted footnote in the shape of a stoppage-time red card for the substitute, Theo Hernández. He cleaned out the former PSG player, Xavi Simons, with an elbow. Simons had come on as a replacement.Spurs competed, as Frank had demanded. They grew into the game as an attacking force, which was positive. It was just an irritation that they could not keep the back door bolted. Some of their defending was loose, to say the least, as they fell to a first defeat of the Champions League campaign.All eyes had been on how Spurs lined up. Would Frank stick with a back five, one of the moves that had played so badly against Arsenal? The answer was no. He loaded his starting XI with four central midfielders and arranged them in a diamond at the outset, Archie Gray at the tip behind Kolo Muani and Richarlison.It was another new setup from Frank, although flexibility was the watchword, Gray dropping deep out of possession, Lucas Bergvall pushing up when he could on the left. It felt significant that Frank’s No 1 midfielder, João Palhinha, started among the substitutes. Ditto the No 1 attacker, Mohammed Kudus. Did Frank have one eye on Fulham?Vitinha was in the mood, wowing with the sharpness of his turns, the range of his passing. There was a deftness to his floated ball on 21 minutes that picked out the run of Warren Zaïre-Emery in behind the Spurs backline. The finish was confused.Moments earlier, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had banged past the far post from distance but Spurs were comfortable in the first half. Frank’s midfielders brought the energy, the hard running and there was evidence that Spurs wanted to get up the pitch.The breakthrough was such a tonic for Spurs – just as Vitinha’s equaliser was a sickener, especially in terms of the timing. It was Bergvall who ignited the move for 1-0 with a lovely flick for Gray, allowing him to cross from the left. Up went Kolo Muani, unmarked beyond the far post, and his header gave Richarlison the relatively simple task of nodding home his sixth of the season from close range. Kolo Muani was unaffected by having to wear a mask to protect his broken jaw.Vitinha’s first was a beauty, yet another illustration of his technical brilliance. When PSG worked a corner short, the 18-year-old striker, Quentin Ndjantou – on his full Champions League debut – rolled square along the edge of the box. It was inviting. Vitinha unloaded first time with his right foot, the ball crashing in off the underside of the crossbar.Spurs went back in front at the start of the second half, Kolo Muani returning a dramatic goalline clearance from Willian Pacho with interest, the connection on the volley so pure. The chance had been created when Richarlison headed Pedro ­Porro’s deep corner back inside for Gray to hook goalwards. Pacho thought he had saved the day. He had not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inevitably, it was Vitinha, who cut on to his left foot to shape a curler into the far corner. Luis Enrique would get his fit again Ballon d’Or winner, Ousmane Dembélé, on as a substitute towards the end. Frank said Vitinha would win the next Ballon d’Or.Spurs cracked. The concessions for numbers three and four were grisly, self-inflicted wounds to the fore. Pape Sarr was robbed by Hernández after Spurs had tried to play out from the back, Cristian Romero putting his teammate into trouble. Seconds later, Fabián Ruiz had swept home. And how did Spurs not clear the corner for No 4? Sarr looked as though he had to do so but he could not. Pacho made him pay.Kolo Muani’s goal for 4-3 was another clean finish after Rodrigo Bentancur had done the unthinkable and dispossessed Vitinha.Frank was happy, saying he saw character and aggression in his team; a soul. But it was fitting that Vitinha completed the scoring. Romero leapt in to block a shot from him, doing so with a hand.

The England player’s last game came inthe World Cup finalin September when the Red Roses defeated Canada 33-13 in front of a world‑record crowd of 81,885 at Twickenham. Alongside the World Cup in her 59‑cap international career, the 28-year-old Dow won seven Six Nations titles and two WXV 1 trophies.English rugby unveils plan to build on women’s glory: ‘The stakes have never been higher’Read moreThe announcement is not a complete surprise as the wing left her club, Trailfinders, in June and had not signed for another side before the Premiership Women’s Rugby season, which began on 24 October.“I never realised when I picked up a rugby ball at the age of five that I was at the start of a 23-year sporting career,” Dow said. “Rugby has been central to my life and has shaped me into who I am today. However I feel the pull of my other passion, engineering, so I have decided to hang up my boots and try my luck in a different world.“The rugby family has given much more that I could ever give back. I would like to thank my coaches, family, friends, and most importantly the fans. They have enabled me to participate in something truly wonderful. I feel very privileged and humble.”Dow played for Wasps, Harlequins and then Trailfinders, winning her first cap in 2017 against Canada. She was a part of the first group of England women’s players to receive full-time contracts in 2019. She scored 50 tries in her Red Roses career, the last of those coming in this year’sWorld Cup quarter‑final against Scotland.Off the pitch she gained a masters degree in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London.View image in fullscreenAbby Dow’s final appearance for England came in the World Cup final victory over Canada at Twickenham.Mitchell said: “Abby is an awesome individual and a fierce competitor who lifts those around her. She is intelligent, insightful and inquisitive – attributes that have defined the brilliant Red Rose she has been across her 59 caps.“Abby has been part of an era for the Red Roses in which the game has grown exponentially and, throughher love of crochet, her interaction with supporters and her undoubted rugby ability, she has helped drive the women’s game to unprecedented heights.“I personally believe that we are losing arguably the best right winger in world rugby at the peak of her powers, but we fully respect her decision to move on to a new chapter. We will miss having her in our environment, and we look forward to seeing her succeed – as we know she will – in whatever she chooses to do next.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the landmark case has highlighted the risks to footballers of environmental exposure to banned substances and opened up the possibility of further controversies emerging around the thousands of synthetic pitches across Europe.The spectre of a doping violation had not been on anyone’s minds when Vålerenga faced LSK Kvinner at LSK-Hall in Lillestrøm, near Oslo, on 22 April. But a routine drug test found four players from each side had returned samples containing the prohibited substance 1,3-dimethylbutylamine (DMBA). One of the samples, belonging to the Vålerenga player in question, exceeded the Wada reporting threshold of 50 ng/ml.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It triggered an investigation that baffled officials from both clubs and Adno, which found no common denominators in food, drink or other supplements consumed by the athletes involved. The affected player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, told the Guardian of the anxiety brought on by learning she was accused of a violation. “It was a terrible moment,” she said. “It was a very upsetting experience and I couldn’t really understand what was going on.”The player was allowed to continue her career while the inquiry continued. She believes the shadow it cast may have affected some of her performances and was deeply relieved when an environmental investigation, which concluded in July, finally discovered the unusual cause.It determined, after testing water samples and substances from multiple sites within the hall, that the shredded tyre granulate – known popularly as rubber crumb – on the pitch had contained the DMBA, which had been transferred to the players during the game. DMBA is a synthetic substance that stimulates the central nervous system and is sometimes used in dietary supplements, although it is banned in Norway and the European Union. It was known, through peer-reviewed scientific studies, to be a product that can occur through breakdown of the rubber-type granulate and there is a degree of frustration that this was not picked up on during the investigation.The player was found to have borne no fault or negligence in the first known case in elite sport where environmental exposure has been responsible for a perceived violation. “I’ve always known I did nothing wrong and I’m grateful to Adno for tracing the source to LSK-Hallen,” she said.“Still, the process and outcome feel somewhat arbitrary. If Adno had not been able to identify the granulate as the source, my situation would have been much more difficult. When you’re extremely careful, follow all the rules and still end up being drawn into a case like this, it shows how vulnerable you are as an athlete.”The surfaces are not deemed to pose a health risk to athletes but concerns have been raised in the past about their role in microplastics pollution. From 2031, rubber crumb infill will be barred from sale in the EU. After the Vålerenga case emerged, the Norwegian Football Federation recommended that indoor competitive matches be moved outdoors. There are about 1,800 such synthetic pitches in Norway and they are also prevalent in the UK, particularly at grassroots level. No international standard exists to ensure turf materials are free of substances banned in sport.Vålerenga want the rules to be bolstered to acknowledge a positive doping test is not always traceable to an athlete’s action, advertent or otherwise. Global rules are based on “strict liability”. Those are expanded upon in article 2.1 of Wada’s anti-doping code, which reads: “It is not necessary that intent, fault, negligence or knowing use on the athlete’s part be demonstrated in order to establish an anti-doping violation.”Harriet Rudd, the Vålerenga CEO, told the Guardian: “Environmental factors really need to be high on the radar moving forward. It’s about having a holistic overview of what in the environment you risk finding in a doping test. Anti-doping work has to develop and issues like this have to become a much larger part of the things you take into consideration.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was initially launched in response to a Treasury proposal to “harmonise” the duty paid on betting and gaming at a single rate.Online betting firms to pay billions more in UK tax, Reeves confirmsRead moreInstead, the chancellor opted for a new regime on gambling duty with a focus on online games of chance, which are associated with significantly higher rates of gambling-related harm than single-event betting. Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), the tax paid on profits from online slots and casino games, will almost double, from 21% to 40%. While the tax rate for online betting on sports other than racing will rise from 15% to 25%, there is no change to the rate on machine gaming or sports betting in high-street shops.“I would like to commend the chancellor and the government for listening to the concerns of British racing and offering their clear support for our sport,” Lord Allen said , “[and] thank everyone who has played their part across the sport, standing as one to communicate our message.“The government has rightly recognised that we are not only a vital part of the fabric of the British way of life, but we are also a global leader and one of the country’s most important soft power levers. We want to maintain Britain’s place on the world stage.”Martin Cruddace, the chief executive of Arena Racing Company (Arc) and a key figure in the “Axe The Racing Tax” campaign, said the sport had “been clear throughout that harmonisation of tax rates of British racing and other betting and gaming products would gravely impact our industry”.He added: “As a sport and industry, we continue to offer a real contribution to this country, supporting communities and culture. I am so glad the government has recognised that fact and helped put our sport on a path to growth.”The new gambling duty regime is closely aligned to proposals put forward by the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank in July. It also follows an intervention in the debate in August by the former prime minister Gordon Brown, calling fora significant rise in online gaming duty.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves announced in Wednesday’s budget that the rate of duty for betting on horse racing will remain unchanged at 15%.Photograph: House of Commons“This decision mirrors the proposals made in our recent SMF report on gambling tax,” said Dr James Noyes, one of the authors of the report. “We are pleased the government has decided to differentiate between different types of gambling product – increasing the duty on more harmful remote casino content while protecting horse racing from the planned rise in betting duty.“For too long, the online gambling industry has been undertaxed. This decision by the chancellor will ensure that operators pay their fair share and brings the UK into line with international best practice.”Gambling operators’ profits on racing bets are subject to an additional 10% deduction to fund the Levy. The decision to increase the rate of duty on non-racing bets, effectively aligning these with racing bets at a total deduction of 25%, will be expected to increase the sport’s attractiveness as a product for online operators.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Thursday tipsShowUttoxeter:12.25 Merry Monty 12.55 Khrisma 1.30 Double Click 2.05 Holokea 2.40 Fortune Dancer 3.15 Soldier’s Leap.Taunton:12.35 Miss Altea Blue 1.05 Iris Des Issards 1.40 Maximum Offers 2.15 Ellerton 2.50 Bashful Boy 3.22 Begin The Luck 3.52 No Risk Today.Lingfield:12.40 Malago Rose 1.15 Moor End 1.50 Broomfield Aderra 2.25 Noble Park 3.00 Mondo Man 3.33 Defi Nonantais.Newcastle:3.28 Jez Bomb 4.05 Leonetto 4.40 Mythical Bay 5.15 Unassuming 5.45 Henery Hawk 6.15 Uniting 6.45 Secret Guest 7.15 Bungle Bay.Chelmsford:4.30 Accommodation 5.00 Snow Light 5.30 Diamond Ali 6.00 An Bradan Feasa 6.30 Madrigal Moment 7.00 Calafrio (nap) 7.30 Parlando (nb) 8.00 Eliza Bennet 8.30 Stratoc.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The budget statement allocated an additional £26m for the Gambling Commission to combat a possible increase in unlicensed gambling, which has been repeatedly raised by the Betting and Gaming Council, the industry’s main lobbying group, as a potential result of tax rises.“We want to collaborate with our betting operator partners to grow the sport,” Brant Dunshea, the BHA’s acting chief executive, said, “and I’m absolutely convinced that betting operators and racing have a shared interest in doing that and are committed to doing so.“Our sport is often criticised for being fragmented and not joined up.

Onlookers had tried to remove him from the vehicle moments before the collisions.More than 50 people needed hospital treatment, including a number of children, as his car struck more than 100 fans in just seven minutes.The youngest victims were two babies aged six months and seven months at the time. The oldest victim, a 77-year-old woman, suffered multiple fractures after being trapped under Doyle’s vehicle with an 11-year-old boy and two others.Doyle originally denied 31 offences against 21 adults and eight children. These included 17 counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm and nine of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.But on Wednesday, on what was due to be the first day of a four-week trial, the father of three sobbed in the dock before changing his pleas to guilty.The judge, Andrew Menary KC, told Doyle he could sit down as the defendant struggled to compose himself. Doyle then sat with his head in his hands after entering all 31 pleas, a process that took eight minutes.Menary told him it was “inevitable that there will be a custodial sentence of some length” when he is sentenced on 15 and 16 December. He is understood to be facing a jail term of more than 10 years.DCI John Fitzgerald of Merseyside police, said it was only “sheer luck” that no one was killed by Doyle’s “reckless actions”. He added: “It is hard to forget the shocking scenes from that day. What should have been a day of celebration for the city turned into a distressing and frightening experience, which we know continues to have a physical and psychological impact on many people.”The courtroom at Liverpool crown court was packed with relatives of the injured as well as members of the defendant’s family.Doyle claimed he had panicked and was afraid for his life after some in the crowd attempted to stop his two-tonne vehicle as it hit fans. That explanation was rejected by prosecutors, who believed he had lost his temper and driven in rage in an attempt to break through the crowd.The Guardian understands that Doyle told police he saw one onlooker with a knife and feared he would be stabbed – an explanation not accepted by detectives. He also claimed to have been struck by a bottle or glass, causing alcohol to get in his eyes. This was later disproved.The seven-minute assault was brought to a halt when a passerby managed to get in the rear of Doyle’s vehicle as it stopped briefly beside him. When Doyle tried to accelerate, the man grabbed the gear stick and held it in park before the driver was pulled from the vehicle and arrested.Footage posted immediately online showed an act of violence so shocking and seemingly indiscriminate that onlookers initially feared it was a terrorist attack. On social media, the speculation was instant: Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, the far-right agitator known as Tommy Robinson, told his 1.7 million followers on X that it was a “suspected terrorist attack”.Conversely, one stunned senior official told the Guardian in the hours following the incident: “It was road rage – a moment of madness.”Though he was arrested initially on suspicion of drug driving, tests showed Doyle was sober. He had driven into Liverpool from his home six miles (10km) away in Croxteth to pick up his friend’s family.Rob Darke, who suffered life-changing injuries, said he thought it was a terror attack when he heard screaming and shouting and “people coming flying towards me”.He told Sky News: “I thought it was terrorists. That’s the first thing that came into my head. Who else would do a thing like that? There was people lying about all over the place. It was like a bomb had gone off … It was carnage everywhere … people crying and screaming.”Darke, who used a wheelchair for three months and is now undergoing counselling for post-traumatic stress disorder, said he could hear “thumps from the car as people were being run over”, adding: “It was horrific.”Neighbours described Doyle as a respectable family man. He served in the Royal Marines in the early 1990s before leaving the military to work in IT and cybersecurity.He is said to have previously worked for an NHS trust and a large UK wealth management firm and run two now-dissolved companies – one of which involved headwear inspired by the actor Vin Diesel.The social media accounts he followed included those of Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, and Andrew Tate, the self-styled “misogynist influencer”.Sarah Hammond, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Doyle’s actions had caused “unimaginable harm” and “brought chaos upon a community”.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Kjoller is being represented by a public defender and the non-profit Civil Rights Corps.The appeals court denied the sanction request without explanation. Then, Kjoller’s lawyers identified similar errors in a filing by the prosecutors’ office in another case. The defense filed another appeal, which was denied when Kjoller was convicted in his criminal case.Kjoller’s lawyers then filed a petition with the California supreme court, identifying three cases they say contain errors typical of generative AI. The court has not yet issued a decision on whether it will take up the case.“Prosecutors’ reliance on inaccurate legal authority can violate ethical rules, and represents an existential threat to the due process rights of criminal defendants and the legitimacy of the courts,” Kjoller’s attorneys wrote. Their filing included examples of instances where the prosecutor’s brief cited nonexistent quotations or misinterpreted court rulings – errors common for artificial intelligence.On Friday, a group of 22 scholars, lawyers and criminal justice advocates filed a brief in support of Kjoller’s case with the California supreme court.In a statement tothe Sacramento Bee, the Nevada county district attorney’s office admitted to using artificial intelligence in one of its filings, but not in Kjoller’s case. District attorney Wilson said other mistakes were due to human error.“Prosecutors work diligently and in good faith under heavy caseloads and time constraints,” Wilson said. “It cannot now be assumed that every citation error stems from the use of artificial intelligence.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although lawyers fromCanada,Australia, theUnited Kingdomand theUnited Stateshave been fined for their use of artificial intelligence, those cases have not generally involved the prosecution.

He claimed it was part of a standard physical and would not reveal what body part the test had analyzed.On Tuesday, theTimes wrotethat Trump was exhibiting “signs of fatigue” as he “faces realities of aging in office”.Trump, now the oldest person ever to hold the presidency, was said to have appeared drowsy at a 6 November Oval Office event, where his “eyelids drooped until his eyes were almost closed, and he appeared to doze on and off for several seconds”.Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesperson for the paper,defended its journalists.“The Times’s reporting is accurate and built on first hand reporting of the facts. Name-calling and personal insults don’t change that, nor will our journalists hesitate to cover this administration in the face of intimidation tactics like this,” he said in a statement.“Expert and thorough reporters like Katie Rogers exemplify how an independent and free press helps the American people better understand their government and its leaders,” it reads.Trump, who has a history of making extremely personal attacks on female journalists, referred to a Bloomberg News correspondent as a “piggy” during aclash onboardAir Force One less than two weeks ago.When Catherine Lucey, Bloomberg’s White House correspondent, started to ask why Trump was behaving the way he was regarding the Epstein files “if there’s nothing incriminating in the files”, Trump pointed at her and said: “Quiet. Quiet, piggy.”Last week, after facing questioning from Mary Bruce, an ABC News White House correspondent about the murder ofJamal Khashoggiand the Epstein scandal, Trump responded “It’s not the question that I mind. It’s your attitude. I think you are a terrible reporter – it’s the way you ask these questions,” adding “You’re a terrible person and a terrible reporter.”Trump has a long history of reserving his harshest criticisms for women,callingfemale journalists“nasty”and referencing menstruationto dismiss questionsfrom Megyn Kelly.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNew York TimesUS press and publishingNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesnewsShareReuse this content"

Our response to these allegations includes difficult facts about Adam’s mental health and life circumstances.“The original complaint included selective portions of his chats that require more context, which we have provided in our response. We have limited the amount of sensitive evidence that we’ve publicly cited in this filing, and submitted the chat transcripts themselves to the court under seal.”The family’s lawyer, Jay Edelson, called OpenAI’s response “disturbing” and said the company “tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, by arguing that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act”.Earlier this month, OpenAI washit by seven further lawsuitsin California courts relating to ChatGPT, including an allegation it acted as a “suicide coach”.A spokesperson for the company said at the time: “This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we’re reviewing the filings to understand the details. We train ChatGPT to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”In August, Open AI said it wasstrengthening the safeguardsin ChatGPT when people engage in long conversations because experience had shown that parts of the model’s safety training might degrade in these situations.“For example, ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards,” it said. “This is exactly the kind of breakdown we are working to prevent.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

These are called “tiebacks” and will enable a small amount of new fossil fuel extraction. The government argues that this will help ensure they remain economically viable and are managed for the entirety of their lifespan.Environmental campaigners say this will result in a relatively low amount of fossil fuel extraction. Tessa Khan, the executive director of the environmental nonprofit Uplift, said: “This government is right to end the fiction of endless drilling. The North Sea is an ageing basin, with most of the gas already burned, and new licensing will do nothing to stem the decline in jobs.“We now need this government to be bolder – to make sure the jobs and wealth generated from the shift to clean energy reach UK workers and communities, and to ensure we maintain a livable climate. That means a proper plan for workers and an end to all new fields, including the huge Rosebank oilfield.”Analysis from Uplift, based on NSTA (North Sea Transition Authority) and Rystad data, shows that new discoveries within a 30-mile (50km) radius of existing production sites contain just 25m barrels of oil and another 20m barrels’ worth of oil equivalent in gas. For context, the Rosebank oilfield – a decision on which is due imminently – would involve the extraction of nearly 500m barrels of oil and gas-equivalent over the course of its lifetime.In the budget, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced that fuel duty had been frozen until next September after a campaign from the Sun newspaper and rightwing MPs. The tax was designed to increase by 1p plus the rate of inflation annually, to incentivise drivers to use greener forms of transport. However, since 2010, every chancellor has kept rates frozen which, according to theSocial Market Foundation(SMF), has meant the real value of fuel duty has tumbled and the equivalent of 81p in 2010 terms is now worth 53p today. The 15-year freeze has cost the exchequermore than £130bn, it is estimated.ExxonMobil to shut chemicals plant in Fife with loss of up to 450 jobsRead moreResearch from the SMF has found the freeze saves the richest households, who tend to drive larger cars, considerably more than it does the poorest, who are far less likely to own a car. It also fails to incentivise switching to electric vehicles or public transport. This needs to happen if the UK is to meet net zero goals; domestic transport is themost emitting sector, accounting for 28% of total domestic emissions in the UK.The government will also introduce a tax on EVs and plug-in hybrids. The rate will be 3p per mile and increase annually with inflation. The average EV driver doing 8,500 miles a year will face an extra £255 in the first year, according toestimatesfrom the Office for Budget Responsibility.Colin Walker, the head of transport at theEnergyand Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “Having already increased the vehicle excise duty on EVs, and given in to industry lobbying by weakening its EV sales targets, the government risks sending mixed signals and undermining consumer confidence by trying to encourage drivers into EVs with one policy and possibly putting them off with another. The net result could be to keep people stuck in dirtier and more expensive petrol cars for longer.”Reeves will be moving green levies from bills to general taxation. This will remove about £2.3bn a year from bills from April for three years, which will save the average household about £150 a year. Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, Ami McCarthy, said: “Shifting most green levies into general taxation is great news for bill payers and will fund long-term bill-saving schemes far more fairly.”It will be paid for by scrapping the ECO (energy company obligation) scheme, which paid for energy efficiency upgrades for the poorest households, although it has beencriticisedfor being poorly executed and Reeves said it had cost some households more than they had saved.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Thelarge costs to upgrade the electricity grid, to ensure new renewables can be connected, as well as the rising costs of building renewables, has meant this has been impossible to do without removing levies from bills. These pay for things such as insulation for poorer households and the warm homes discount for those who find it hard to pay bills.Andy Hackett, a senior policy adviser at the Centre for Net Zero, said: “Cutting levies on electricity is welcome and overdue, but it can’t come at the cost of cutting the very investments in homes that help make bills fall for good – especially for those in fuel poverty.“The knock-on impact on Labour’s warm homes plan could leave them spending less on home upgrades than the previous government, despite repeatedly blaming them for a record of underinvestment. You can’t build a modern, clean energy superpower on old housing stock. The government should not backtrack on its warm homes plan, especially for fuel-poor households.”While oil and gas companies lobbied hard for the government to remove the windfall tax introduced by the Conservatives in 2022, Reeves resisted this. She said the energy profits levy will remain until 2030, and will raise £2.7bn in 2025-26. In a sign of the slow demise of the North Sea basin, this is 40% less than will be raised in 2024-25. McCarthy said: “Holding firm on the oil and gas windfall tax, despite fierce industry lobbying, will also continue to support the transition to clean energy.”Mike Childs, the head of policy at Friends of the Earth, commenting on the absence of polluter-pays taxes, said: “The government has missed a golden opportunity to make the biggest polluters pay for the damage they cause – a move that would curb pollution and help fund real solutions. They should have introduced progressive measures like a frequent-flyer levy and used the money raised to boost much depleted bus services.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryBudget 2025Oil (Environment)Gas (Environment)EnergyFossil fuelsGas (Business)analysisShareReuse this content"

A small boat cuts through the water, propelled by a bamboo pole scraping the muddy bottom of the canal.Bashir Ahmed manoeuvres his frail craft with agility. His slender boat is more than just a means of transport. It is the legacy of a people who live to the rhythm of water: the Mohana. They have lived for generations on the waters of Lake Manchar in Sindh province, a vast freshwater mirror covering nearly 250 sq km. The lake, once the largest inPakistan, was long an oasis of life. Now, it is dying.View image in fullscreenBashir Ahmed in his boat on the lake, next to simple huts built on top of the right bank outfall drainOn the opposite shore, Bashir’s father, Mohamed, the head of this community of about 50 people, waits for him. The two men settle in the shade. “We were the lords of the lake,” Mohamed says. “This water was full of fish. Our boats were our homes. We thought they would never sink. But look now … the lake has turned to poison.”For us, leaving the lake was like asking the birds to stop flyingAli KasgharThat poison has flowed through a specific channel: the right bank outfall drain, or RBOD. Built in the 1990s, the canal was meant to make the salty soils of western Sindh fit for cultivation. In reality, it rerouted agricultural wastewater laden with fertilisers and pesticides, along with industrial effluent and sewage from several cities, directly into Lake Manchar. In just a few decades, the lake’s salinity has soared, oxygen has dropped, algae have proliferated, and the lake’s fragile ecosystem has collapsed. Climate breakdown has only hastened the disaster. A decrease in rainfall, combined with the construction of two upstream dams on the River Indus, has significantly reduced the flow of fresh water.View image in fullscreenA Mohana hunter holds a thin branch with a living bird tethered to the end, which he uses as a decoy to trap wild birdsThere was a time when Lake Manchar teemed with life. In the 1930s, more than 200 species of fish were recorded in its waters. By 1998,only 32 remained. Since then, abouta dozen more have vanished. The Sindh Fisheries Department estimates that average catcheshave droppedfrom more than 3,000 tonnes in 1950 to 300 tonnes in 1994 and to less than 100 tonnes today. Many of the commercially viable species have disappeared, and what remains are often low-value fish, sold cheaply for chicken feed rather than human consumption.While he now lives on dry land, Bashir was born on the water. He grew up on board a houseboat, part of a floating village that no longer exists. Twenty years ago, they were forced to leave and settle along the shores when fishing no longer brought in enough to maintain their boats.“For us, leaving the lake was like asking the birds to stop flying,” says Ali Kasghar, who still captures birds on the lake. “The birds taught us so much. Like them, we lived on the water. Like them, we drank from the lake. And like them, we fed ourselves on the fish it gave.”View image in fullscreenChildren create a slide on the steep slope of the right bank outfall drainView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenThe water by the drain is used for bathing, washing cooking utensils and doing laundry. In the 1930s more than 200 species of fish were recorded in the waters, by 1998, only 32 remainedOnce, more than 20,000 Mohana lived in floating homes. Today, only about 40 such homes remain, housing fewer than 500 people. Their numbers continue to dwindle as the water grows more toxic.Those who remain cling to their traditions – including the way they hunt birds.View image in fullscreenOnly about 40 floating homes such as these are still in use on the lake’s watersView image in fullscreenMohana children make rafts out of discarded polystyrene and use them to visit relatives or play togetherKasghar is one of the last masters of this ancient technique. He glides slowly across the lake’s surface, led by a live bird tethered to the end of a slender branch. This feathered companion allows him to approach other birds without alarming them until the final moment, when he grabs them with lightning speed.Others use an even more surprising method: submerged up to the neck, they fix a stuffed bird to their heads as camouflage. Fooled by the decoy, other birds come close.The captured birds are sold at markets in nearby towns or used to feed the family. A few are kept and raised, becoming pets or hunting decoys in their turn.View image in fullscreenKasghar uses the lake’s birds to help him huntBut the birds, too, are vanishing. Lake Manchar was once a key stopover on the Indus flyway, hosting tens of thousands of migratory visitors from Siberia and central Asia. According to the Sindh Wildlife Department’s 2024-25 waterfowl count, numbers across the province have fallen by more than half in just two years: migratory bird numbers plunged from 1.2 million in 2023 to 603,900 in 2024 and just 545,000 this year.

A group of about 50 people from the Munduruku, an Indigenous people in the Amazon basin, had blocked the entrance to theCop30venue in protest, causing long lines of delegates to snake down access roads, simmering in the morning heat.The Munduruku, unhappy about the ruination of their forest and rivers by industry and their lack of voice at Cop30, demanded to speak to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s president. Instead, they got André Corrêa do Lago, the president of the talks.With a scrum of onlookers and reporters jostling, Corrêa do Lago appeared and seemed to recognise the visual power of the moment. He was handed a baby cradled by one of the women in the group and held the child for some time, the angular diplomat in his open-necked shirt and suit puffing his cheeks out and smiling at a baby with body paint and a garland of bright petals.A veteran diplomat, Corrêa do Lago’s role was to listen, nodding along to the protestations from the Indigenous representatives. He then led the Munduruku, with their spears, bows and arrows, young and old alike, through the crowd to a gated building for a further conversation, which lasted for more than three hours.OM‘Nothing about us without us’View image in fullscreenIndigenous Munduruku people take part in a protest to call for climate justice and territorial protection at Cop30 on 15 November.Photograph: Adriano Machado/ReutersCop negotiations can feel sterile and removed from the real world. Saturday’s protest was a reminder of the stakes of the climate crisis. Demonstrators travelled from across the Brazilian Amazon and around the world to demand the protection of forests, the phasing out of fossil fuels, and the prioritisation of climate justice.It was the first major protest at a Cop in four years, after consecutive conferences in the repressive regimes of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan. Some marchers dressed in black staged a funeral for coal, oil and gas. Others held a 40-foot tall globe. Many called for marginalised people to have seat at the table in climate talks. Among the chants: “Nothing about us without us.”DNDemand for a just transitionView image in fullscreenIrene Vélez Torres, Colombia’s environment minister, during the launch of the Belém declaration coordinated with the Netherlands to transition away from fossil fuels.Photograph: Bianca Otero/Zuma Press Wire/ShutterstockColombia led a group of several dozen nations that ensured a just transition from fossil fuels was debated more often and more loudly than ever before at Cop30, even if the final agreement at Belém omitted all mention of oil, gas or coal. At a raucous press conference, the South American nation and the Netherlands announced they will hold a first international conference on the transition away from fossil fuels in Colombia next year.Clearly frustrated by the slow pace of UN talks, 24 countries signed up to the creation of a separate but complementary process for high-ambition nations.A contingent of top scientists in Belém warnedofclimate “tipping points”and other dire consequences without a rapid transition.It was the central topic of a press conference by theFossil Fuel Non-Profileration Treaty initiativeand then raised again when82 countries from across the globecame together to back a roadmap. Brazil has promised to support a roadmap for the rest of its year-long presidency of Cop30. They will meet strong resistance from major oil producing nations. But, as Colombia’s environment minister, Irene Vélez Torres, said: “The fight will go on.”JWPanic at the talks – and then disaster avertedView image in fullscreenAndré Corrêa do Lago with Simon Stiell, the UN climate chief, during a plenary session.Photograph: André Penner/APSoon after the “mutirão” text – the core agreement at Cop30, which contained an oblique rather than direct reference to the need to phase out fossil fuels – was gavelled on Saturday afternoon, there was a sudden hiatus in the closing plenary session. Colombia raised an objection, and said it had not been heard. The Cop rulebook had to be consulted on whether another part of the complex agreement could be in effect “ungavelled” and reopened. And if it was, would that invalidate the previous gavelling of themutirãotext?After more than an hour of consultation it was decided that the gavelling still stood, and the other disagreements were smoothed over. Disaster averted.Cops are subject to heart-stopping moments at the gavelling stage. Last year India forced a halt in what would have been the closing minutes, when it disagreed with the deal. It was allowed through anyway – decisions can only be made by consensus but that does not mean unanimity.Even at Paris, those of us in the plenary hall expecting an imminent gavelling on Saturday evening were kept waiting nearly two hours – close examination of the text had found a “shall” where countries had only agreed a “should” and it had to be amended.A deal on the substantive issues was concluded by ministers from the 17 regional and interest groups at Cop30 at about 7.15am. Somehow, it still took until nearly 9pm to finish the Cop. In part, that is down to procedural issues. But it also reflects how hard it is to push through a deal with 194 countries by consensus.FH‘I had dreamed of bigger results’: Marina SilvaView image in fullscreenAn emotional Marina Silva during the closing plenary on 22 November.Photograph: Kiara worth/© IISD/ENB - Kiara WorthOne of the most touching moments of Cop30 was the demonstration of tearful humility, then inspiring defiance, by Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, at the closing plenary.Given a rapturous standing ovation for her ultimately unsuccessful efforts to create a roadmap away from fossil fuels and deforestation – the two most crucial issues in tackling global heating – Silva initially hung her head and sobbed, evidently overwhelmed by emotion. “I had dreamed of bigger results,” she had admitted shortly before.But the applause continued and Silva lifted her head, then her arms, clasping her hands together in thanks, then raising a fist to demonstrate the fight would go on. Nobody tried harder than this daughter of the Amazon rainforest to lift the ambition of the Belém conference. She persuaded Lula to put the roadmaps on the Cop30 agenda as she urged him to take strong action to reduce deforestation, which is why Brazil has shown more progress than any other country to cut emissions over the past year.Silva has also been a driving force behind the Tropical Forest Forever Facility, which was drawn up in consultation with Indigenous and other traditional peoples, and for the first time promises direct payments to the communities who do the most to maintain standing forests.That the global south emerged from Cop30 with a great deal more credit than the global north is largely thanks to her endeavours.JWExplore more on these topicsCop30Climate crisisBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

What does that mean? ‘Didn’t engage in racism with intent.’ I have no doubt that if a young Jewish student was hissed at to mimic the sound of a gas chamber, they would find it upsetting.“He may want to forget that. They won’t. He clearly remembers some of what happened. He should seek those people out and go and apologise to them.”Aides to Farage had initially told the Guardian: “The suggestion that Mr Farage ever engaged in, condoned, or led racist or antisemitic behaviour is categorically denied.” But in abroadcast interview on Monday night, Farage broke his silence over the allegations and denied any “intent” to inflict hurt on people due to their race or religion.In a further statement on Tuesday, he appeared to change his stance again. “I can tell you categorically that I did not say the things that have been published in the Guardian aged 13, nearly 50 years ago,” he said.Farage told GB News on Tuesday: “I absolutely deny the charges that are made by this one individual.”At a press conference on Wednesday after the budget, he said: “One person says they were hurt, and if they feel they were hurt, then I’m genuinely sorry.” He followed this with another emphatic denial: “But I never, ever, ever would have said or done anything like that directly to a human being. Absolutely not.”He also said at the press conference that Ettedgui’s “recollections are simply wrong”. However, six other peoplesay they recall the targeted abuse of Ettedgui, now an Emmy- and Bafta-winning director.Ettedgui told the Guardian on Wednesday: “I hugely appreciate the prime minister’s supportive words, as I am sure will the many others who suffered racist abuse from Farage at school.“While that abuse remains fresh in the memory over four decades later, I’m really not sure which is the more offensive: the schoolboy Farage’s approving references to Jews going to the gas chambers, or the adult Farage gaslighting those of us who have chosen to speak up with his bizarre denials and total lack of contrition.”Writing earlierin the Guardian, Ettedgui responded to Farage’s denials, saying: “Farage suggeststhat he has never ‘directly’ abused anyone, or at least he did not do so with any intention to hurt. He has said that those who have claimed otherwise are not telling the truth. Well, he did directly target me and I can tell you that it did hurt. How did he think it would make me feel? How does he think those who were called Pakis or told to ‘go home’ felt?“His aides have said it is ‘one person’s word against another’.

The aim of the scheme is to deter asylum seekers from crossing the Channel in small boats.Two of those already removed to France have since returned to the UK on small boats: an Iranian man who was then forcibly returned to France for a second time; and an Eritrean man, who is in a detention centre and is due to be removed to France on Thursday.One hunger striker told the Guardian: “I am exhausted by this situation and find it deeply unfair and unjust. I arrived on a boat with 83 other people, and only 12 of us were moved to a detention centre.“The rest are being processed through the asylum system normally and are now in hotels. Meanwhile, we are being held here alongside people who may have criminal convictions.“I repeatedly approached the office here to ask for answers and waited for hours every day, but I was never given any information. Each time I was sent back to my room. Feeling hopeless, I decided to join the others in starting a hunger strike.“I need this message to reach the Home Office and for the public to understand that we do not deserve this treatment. We have done nothing wrong to be treated this way.”Another said: “Life has completely stopped for me since I was detained. It feels like living in limbo, with the constant fear of being sent back to places that are unsafe for me, such as France or my home country.”A third person taking part in the protest said: “We decided to go on hunger strike because we have been treated like criminals.“We have a reason why we came to this country: to be protected. We have not done anything against society or to anyone … We are normal people, and we would like to be free and to have our human rights, and protection.”Charlotte Buckley, the director ofBail for Immigration Detainees, a charity supporting some of the hunger strikers, said: “We join those on hunger strike in calling for their right to claim asylum in the UK, which is protected under the 1951 Refugee Convention.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While numbers fluctuated year by year, the 2023-24 period saw the steepest rise.Leroy Logan, a former Met superintendent, told the Guardian that he had been contacted by a number of serving officers who feel they are facing increased disciplinary action.He suggested that the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) was targeting Black staff to help generate the dismissal figures underpinning the Met’s public drive against misconduct.“It’s quite clear from the data that, since the commissioner has had this real war on sexist, misogynist and other criminally minded officers, he’s allowed the [DPS] to ride roughshod throughout the organisation,” he said.“They’re not being as objective as they should be. Consequently, Black officers – African, Caribbean and Asian officers – are being more focused on than white officers.”College of Policing data shows the Met dismissed 183 officers in the year to 31 March 2025, out of 735 dismissals recorded across UK forces.Met police’s culture makes racial harm ‘inevitable’, internal review findsRead moreAccording to the FoI response, only a small number of those who challenged their dismissal were successful across the last five years. Most cases ended in withdrawals, settlements, strike-outs or judgments in favour of the Met. The force noted that tribunal cases can take months or years to conclude.The rise in claims follows sustained scrutiny of the Met’s internal culture, including the Casey review and investigations into racism, discrimination and misconduct. It also comes after the 30 Patterns of Harm review, commissioned by the Met, which concluded that anti-Black racism is “baked into institutional design”.In October, the Guardianrevealed the report’s existenceand that the force had delayed its publication for months. It was released in November after pressure from Black staff. The review is understood to be the first internal inquiry commissioned by the Met specifically examining anti-Black racism within its structures.The Met said it was working to improve internal culture, recruitment and promotion processes, highlighting steps taken since the Casey review, including the publication of new organisational values. It said rebuilding culture in an organisation of its size “takes time” and was ongoing.When approached about the rise in tribunal claims, a Met spokesperson said: “We have been clear we have much more to do to tackle the systemic, cultural, leadership and regulatory failings that have allowed racism to put down deep roots in the Met.“We want to be an anti-racist and actively inclusive organisation, creating a workplace that is accessible to all and where everyone can thrive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Last month, he described his efforts as “the biggest corruption clear-out in British policing history”, claiming that 11 officers or staff were being forced out each week.Rowley’s comments followeda BBC Panorama investigationinto racism, misogyny and officers boasting about the use of force at Charing Cross police station.Up until that point, the Met had repeatedly promised change after the murder of Sarah Everardby a serving officer, stating that about 1,400 officers had been dismissed or had resigned under its strengthened misconduct process. The Panorama investigation suggested that a toxic culture persisted inside the force and that discriminatory attitudes had not been eradicated but pushed “underground”.The Met denied allegations of targeting Black staff while protecting white colleagues. A spokesperson said: “There is no deliberate targeting of Black colleagues or others from a diverse background, nor any protection for white officers and staff. However, we know there is disproportionality in misconduct processes and that is a concern for the Met, our staff and wider communities.“We have been working hard to understand and mitigate this, putting in place a number of measures to safeguard our processes, but there is more to do to meet our commitment to tackle all forms of discrimination in our organisation”.Responding to the FoI data, Diane Vincent, chair of the Metropolitan BlackPoliceAssociation, said: “The result from the FoI request, 30 Patterns of Harm, BBC Panorama, Casey, are all evidence to support what we have been saying for a very long time.“The fact that new reports on structural racism continue to emerge suggests that past recommendations have not sufficiently addressed the structural and cultural problems. The signal these reports send is strong, and their criticisms are deep, pointing to systemic issues rather than one-off problems.“If we [are to] build trust and confidence, if we are to represent the community we serve, if we are to retain our Black, African, Caribbean and Asian workforce, then we need to do better than this.”Explore more on these topicsMetropolitan policeRaceEmployment tribunalsPoliceLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

His memo, outlining his concerns about reporting over Donald Trump, Gaza and trans issues, was leaked to the Daily Telegraph.Mark Damazer, a former deputy director of BBC News who has been touted as a figure who could help the corporation through the current crisis, pointed to a toxic culture of distrust at the top of the broadcaster.Damazer said he did not believe there had been any malign intent on behalf of Robbie Gibb, the BBC board member and Theresa May’s former communications chief in Downing Street, who has been accused of pushing concerns of liberal bias.However, he said there had been a lack of self-reflection on the part of some board members about how to conduct their role overseeing the BBC.“There have always been political appointments and people have more or less been able to leave their ideology on the peg outside,” he said, addressing the Voice of the Listener and Viewer conference in London.Reith lecturer accuses BBC of cowardice for censoring his remarks on TrumpRead more“Have recent appointments changed that into what I think is a culture of over-assertion, lack of self consciousness, insufficient reflection on what their job is? … I think that there’s enough evidence to presuppose that something is not right in that equation.“You’ve got toxic mix of, in my view, a lack of a benign corporate culture and benign sense of reflection and self consciousness, with a management that feels embattled – and there you have the coordinates for trouble.”Pressure is increasing on Samir Shah, the BBC’s chair, after accusations he exacerbated the crisis by delaying the BBC’s response to the bias claims and failing to keep the board united. One board member has resigned, saying the BBC’s responsehas given encouragement to its enemies.Damazer did not blame the BBC’s chair, saying Shah had inherited its structures and personnel.However, he suggested Gibb should have recused himself from judging the BBC output in relation to the Middle East, given that for four years, he was the beneficial owner of the Jewish Chronicle.It was during Gibb’s time at the publication that it appointed an editor criticised for using it as a“partisan, ideological instrument”.Damazer said that, given Gibb’s support for impartiality, he found it surprising he did not recuse himself from judging BBC journalism on Middle East issues when they came before the BBC’s educational guidance and standards committee (EGSC). Gibb is one of a handful of the committee’s members.Damazer said an issue of such “ferocious intensity and velocity is bound to lead to, at the very least, and I mean at the very least, severe questions of perception … the only plausible thing to do would be to step back”.Gibbtold MPs on the culture, media and sport committeeon Monday that he had “no editorial role whatsoever” on the Jewish Chronicle. He also made clear that he had broken ties with the publication before a group of columnists walked out over its political stance.However, Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, pointed to testimony that questioned that account.He cited claims by Lee Harpin, a former reporter on the Jewish Chronicle, who stated Gibb held interviews for the post of deputy editor.Harpin also recountshow Gibb “made a habit of calling into the office on print days early after the new owners took control to check up on what stories were topping the news list, and offering a view”.Gibb was approached for comment. The BBC said Gibb was one of 13 members of the BBC board and that the EGSC was not involved in day-to-day output, only reviewing post-broadcast issues and complaints.Explore more on these topicsBBCTim DavienewsShareReuse this content"

If today we legitimise and formalise the undermining of borders, we open the doors for more wars tomorrow, and we cannot let this happen.”The US continues to push for an end to the conflict. Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff – who wasexposed for coaching the Kremlinon the best way to win the US leader’s favour – is expected to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow early next week, while the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, will meet the Ukrainian side.View image in fullscreenVon der Leyen said so far we have seen ‘no signs of true willingness to end the conflict’.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAVon der Leyen welcomed Trump’s efforts to find peace, describing them as “a starting point”, but made clear that Europe had many concerns about the details outlined in the original 28-point US-Russian plan. Some of the maximalistRussia-friendly demands have since been removed, Ukraine has said, and the US president has rowed back on his Thursday deadline tied to the US holiday of Thanksgiving amidlittle sign of progress on key sticking points.Describing the situation as volatile and dangerous, von der Leyen said she saw “an opportunity here to make real progress”, adding: “So far we have seen no signs fromRussiaof true willingness to end this conflict. So we have to keep up the pressure on Russia.”In a hastily arranged video call on Wednesday, EU foreign ministers “reaffirmed our shared principles”, according to Europe’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, referring to sovereignty, independence, territorial independence and “Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence”.View image in fullscreenKaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said there was ‘zero indication’ that Russia was ready for a ceasefire.Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAKallas, a former prime minister of Estonia, said everyone welcomed the US push for peace, before setting out an analysis of the conflict that vastly differed from the worldview informing the 28-point plan.“Right now we see zero indication that Russia is ready for a ceasefire,” she said. “We still need to get from a situation where Russia pretends to negotiate to a situation where they need to negotiate. We are getting there.”Kallas referred to the “failed” Russian summer offensive and the impact of western sanctions on Russia’s economy. “The notion that Ukraine is losing is also flat out false. If Russia could conquer Ukraine militarily, it would have already done so by now. Putin cannot achieve its goals on the battlefield, so he will try to negotiate his way there.”She said that in the last century Russia had attacked more than 19 countries, some three or four times. “So in any peace agreement, we have to put the focus on how to get concessions from the Russian side that they stop the aggression for good and do not try to change borders by force.”EU officials also argue against limits on Ukraine’s armed forces. Such a restriction would “leave the country vulnerable to future attacks”, von der Leyen said, adding that Ukraine also needed “robust, credible and long-term security guarantees”.In a leaked recording, Witkoff told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk and potentially a separate territorial exchange. The original 28-point plan called on Ukraine to cede the entire Donetsk region to Russia, including areas under Ukrainian control.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and Steve Witkoff in August. The pair are expected to meet again next week.Photograph: Gavriil Grigorov/ReutersAccording to a Reuters report citing three sources, the US 28-point plan was drawn from a Russian report submitted to the White House in October. A senior Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, told state TV that Moscow had seen the latest version of the US plan, saying: “Some aspects can be viewed positively, but many require special discussions among experts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

EU leadersfailed to endorse the idealast month because of legal doubts from Belgium, which hosts about €183bn of assets, most of Russia’s sovereign wealth in the EU and two-thirds of the worldwide total.Trump’s proposal for the US to take 50% profits on a US-led venture to “rebuild and invest in Ukraine” based on $100bn from the Russian frozen assets is adding to pressure on European leaders to resolve the issue. The US also wants Europe to contribute $100bn to the reconstruction investment fund.Von der Leyen reiterated her support for the frozen assets plan – an EU loan to Ukraine secured on the assets and the idea that Russia would pay reparations to Kyiv – saying: “I cannot see any scenario in which the European taxpayers alone will pay the bill.”EU leaders will discuss the frozen assets question next month as they try to nail down a 2026-27 funding deal for Kyiv, which is expected to run out of money next spring.Von der Leyen said another European priority was the return of Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia. She said: “There are tens of thousands of boys and girls whose fate is unknown, trapped in Russia by Russia. We will not forget them.”Ukraine’s government hasidentified nearly 20,000 childrenwho have been unlawfully deported or forcibly transferred to Russia since the full-scale invasion in 2022. A Ukrainian organisation working on the issue, Bring Kids Back, has said 1,835 children have returned from deportation, forced transfers and occupied Ukraine.Putin is wanted for alleged war crimes by the international criminal court over the abductions. The original 28-point plan proposed a full amnesty for the actions of all parties involved in the conflict.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUrsula von der LeyenRussiaEuropean UnionEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

They said they had formed “the high military command for the restoration of order”, which would rule the country until further notice.Earlier on Wednesday, shots were heard near the election commission headquarters, presidential palace and interior ministry, although it was not clear who was responsible.The military takeover is the latest in a string of coups and attempted coups in Guinea-Bissau since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974. The average yearly income in the country of 2.2 million people was just $963 (£728) in 2024, according to theWorld Bank.The UNlabelled Guinea-Bissau a “narco state”in 2008 because of its role as ahub for the global cocaine trade.

Both he and his main rival, Fernando Dias, claimed they won in the first round of elections, held on Sunday.Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Embaló claimed the shots were being fired by gunmen affiliated to Dias. But a Dias ally blamed Embaló for trying to simulate a coup attempt so that he could declare an emergency and retain power. Neither provided any evidence for their claims.The election commission was due to announce provisional results in the presidential and parliamentary elections on Thursday.There have been at least nine coups in Guinea-Bissau between independence and Embaló taking office in 2020, according to Reuters.

The Israeli militarysaid it had killed six Hamas militantswho “most likely” had emerged from a tunnel near Rafah, the city in the south of the devastated Palestinian territory.There was no independent confirmation of the claim, but there have been a series of clashes in recent days in the half of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces involving militants trapped in tunnels.On Tuesday, Hamas handed over the remains of Dror Or, an Israeli hostage killed with his wife when their home was stormed by attackers from the Islamist organisation during thesurprise raidinto Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict in Gaza. The remains of two hostages – one Israeli, one Thai – remain in Gaza. Israel has agreed to release 15 Palestinian bodies for each hostage returned.In total, militants fromHamasand allied factions killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 to Gaza during the attack. Almost 70,000 Palestinians were killed and 170,863 injured in the ensuring Israeli offensive, including hundreds since the fragile ceasefire came into effect last month.The next phases of Donald Trump’s20-point planto end the conflict in Gaza, include developing an international body to govern Gaza and oversee reconstruction under a two-year renewable UN mandate. An armed international stabilisation force is to keep security and ensure the disarming of Hamas, a key demand of Israel. The implementation of almost every part of the plan faces massive challenges.Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has spiked since October 2023 and has continued after the ceasefire.According to theUN, Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. UN officials attributed most of these fatalities to “the systematic and excessive use of lethal force by Israeli forces, often involving live fire, airstrikes and shoulder-fired missiles in densely populated areas, resulting in numerous civilian deaths, including children”.At least 44 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military operations in the West Bank,according to the UN.Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch said in a report that the Israeli government’s forced displacement of the populations of West Bank refugee camps in January and February 2025 amounted to war crimes andcrimes against humanity.The32,000 peoplereportedly displaced from the camps have not been permitted to return to their homes, many of which Israel forces have deliberately demolished, the international campaign group said.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

He ultimately lost to the Socialist party’s François Hollande.In a 2021 trial, the state prosecutor had highlighted Sarkozy’s “couldn’t care less” attitude in demanding one rally a day in the form of vast “American-style shows” and allowing costs to rise substantially above the legal limit for a presidential election campaign.The prosecution said accountants had warned Sarkozy he was about to pass the official €22.5m spending cap but that he insisted on holding more events to fend off Hollande, who was gaining ground as a “Mr Normal” seeking to crack down on the world of finance.In the end, Sarkozy’s campaign spending came to at least €42.8m, nearly double the legal limit, prosecutors said.Sarkozy, who denied all wrongdoing, lodged an appeal process that took several years.France’s highest court, the Cour de Cassation, which focuses on whether the law has been applied correctly rather than on the facts of the case, has now upheld an earlier ruling, making Sarkozy’s conviction final.Sarkozy, who was released from prison earlier this month in connection with a separate conviction, will now have to serve his sentence. He had been sentenced on appeal to a one-year prison term, half of which was suspended. That six-month prison term can be served through means such as wearing an electronic tag, without going to jail.Sarkozy has faced a series of legal challenges since leaving office. He is appealing against his conviction forcriminal conspiracyover a scheme to obtain election campaign funds for his 2007 presidential attempt from the regime of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.That is the conviction that in October resulted in himgoing to in La Santé prison in Paris, where he spent 20 days, an experience he described as “gruelling” and a “nightmare”.

Fuel duty in effect costs about 6p a mile on average for cars.The Office forBudgetResponsibility (OBR) said the continued freeze of fuel duty until September and the staggered reversal of the 5p over late 2025-26 would cost the Treasury an extra £2.4bn next year and £900m a year thereafter, but it would bear down on the UK’s CPI inflation by 0.1 percentage points compared with its officially forecast rise in duty.Reeves told the Commons: “Because all cars contribute to the wear and tear on our roads, I will ensure that drivers are taxed according to how much they drive and not just by the type of car they own.”The additional electric vehicle excise duty (VED) will be payable with existing VED or road tax at 3p a mile for fully electric cars or 1.5p for plug-in hybrids. Reeves said it would help “double road maintenance funding in England over the course of this parliament”.She pledged to accelerate the rollout of public EV charging and exemptions from business rates, but disappointed some by not lowering VAT on public charging to meet the domestic rates for electricity.The new EV pay-per-mile charge is expected to raise £1.1bn in 2028-29, rising to £1.9bn in 2030-31. Electric vans, buses and HGVs will not be liable.WithEV advocates alarmed about the potential impacton the transition from fossil fuel to greener vehicles, Reeves said she was “providing support to boost our British car industry”, increasing the threshold for the “luxury car tax” to £50,000 for EVs and providing another £1.3bn in funding for the electric car grant, extending it to 2030.Nonetheless, the OBR forecast that the pay-per-mile charge and counterbalancing measures would reduce EV sales on average by a net 24,000 vehicles a year over the next five years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Reeves said she would “improve competition in our taxi industry by ending ride-hailing companies’ use of a discount scheme intended for coach tours”.The move has been described by some as a “taxi tax” but was backed by Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, as “a landmark moment for fairness and integrity in our industry”.Explore more on these topicsFuel dutyElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsAutomotive industryBudget 2025Petrol pricesMotoringTaxnewsShareReuse this content"

The industry’s lobby group – the Betting & Gaming Council (BGC) – lamented a “devastating hammer blow” for the sector.The most eye-catching change is a near doubling of remote gaming duty (RGD), levied on online casinos, rising from 21% to 40% next April. The rise is higher than many investors and industry sources had expected.UK gambling firms make extra £1bn from punters amid calls for tax risesRead moreMeg Hillier, the chair of the Treasury select committee, said Reeves had rightly refused to bow toindustry “scaremongering”, something her committee had accused lobbyists of in a report earlier this month.“Some parts of the gambling industry, such as racecourses and bingo halls, make a cultural contribution to our country,” she said. “This is not the case, though, for online slots and other remote gaming, which can quickly drain the bank balances of vulnerable people after just a few clicks of a button on a phone.“It’s reassuring to see that the chancellor agrees with us on this and I look forward to discussing it further with her when she appears in front of us in December.”General betting duty, levied on sports bets, will rise from 15% to 25% for wagers placed online from April 2027, but there will be no change for bets placed in high street bookmakers.Bets on horse racing – a sport that relies heavily on income from gambling firms – will beexempted from the increase. Bingo duty of 10% will be abolished from April.Reeves said she was targeting online gambling because it was “associated with the highest levels of harm”.However, she did not increase machine gaming duty, charged on income from high-street slot machines, which are also linked to high rates of addiction.Leading figures from the gambling industry, including company chief executives and lobbyists, claim that an increase on the scale announced by the chancellor will cost jobs and ultimately damage the economy.Grainne Hurst, the chief executive of the BGC, said the increases were a “devastating hammer blow to tens of thousands of people working in the industry”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Entain expects underlying profit to fall by £100m next year and £150m the year after, although it expects to gain market share. Evoke, which owns William Hill and 888, predicted extra duty costs of £135m, while Rank forecast a £40m hit to operating profit.The OBR said it expected the changes to raise an extra £1.1bn a year for the Treasury by 2029-30. The figure would be higher, at £1.8bn, but the government expects some customers to bet less and admits that others are likely to switch to the illicit market, as the extra duty is passed on to consumers in the form of less attractive odds and bonuses.Reeves explicitly linked the increase to the government’s decision to lift the two-child cap on child benefit, listing the duty rise among the measures that funded the latter decision.The former prime minister and chancellor Gordon Brown previouslycalled for a larger increase in duties, raising about £3bn, to pay for lifting children out of poverty.Explore more on these topicsGamblingBudget 2025Sport bettingTax and spendingTaxRachel ReevesGordon BrownnewsShareReuse this content"

Thanks to a combination of outbursts and indiscriminate legal threats, the powerful figures at the centre of a rapidly consolidating industry find themselves with little option but to bend to the president’s every demand. Unfortunately, what he’s demanding is Rush Hour 4.Just a few days ago, this seemed like a weird overreach, like when Trump used a keynote speech at a McDonald’s todemand more tartare sauceon Filet-O-Fish sandwiches. But in this case it really happened. Trump told majority Paramount Skydance shareholder Larry Ellison that he wished someone would make Rush Hour 4, and nowRush Hour 4 is being made.Rush Hour 4 in the works at Paramount after reports of Trump interveningRead moreSo now we find ourselves in a situation where the president of the United States is dictating the sort of films that should be made. The problem with this, of course, is that Trump has famously awfultaste in movies.You know this already. What sort of figure can look out across the entire spectrum of cinema and decide that the thing that most deserves to be made is the third sequel to Rush Hour, starring a septuagenarianJackie Chan? Was there even a third Rush Hour film? Who knows.View image in fullscreenBolo Yeung and Jean-Claude Van Damme in Bloodsport.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyBut other signs were there. Famously, one of Trump’s most beloved films is the 1988 Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts movie Bloodsport. Even more famously, his favoured way to enjoy it involvesforcing one of his sons to fast-forwardthrough the exposition so that he can just watch the bits where people get kicked in the face. Then there’s also his critique of Citizen Kane to consider, in which he forgets all the stuff about the isolation of wealth andsuggeststhat Charles Foster Kane should “get a different woman”.Trump wants to revive the Rush Hour franchise. Is he eyeing a return to Hollywood?Read moreAgain, at the time this all just seemed like a bit of silliness. This is a man who appears to have filled the Oval Office with spray-painted home decor moldings, so of course his taste in film is bad. But now it’s completely evident that what Trump wants, Trump gets. In other words, brace yourself for the second coming of gormless action flicks.Trump’s approval of the Rush Hour series is already an indication that he only likes the bad Jackie Chan films. Not for him the hyper-kinetic ballet of Police Story or Armour of God; he much prefers the ones where Chan has to deliberately dumb himself down for western audiences who chew popcorn with their mouths open.And that means that, now that Trump has Chan right where he wants him, it is only a matter of time before he demands a sequel to Shanghai Noon, the western comedy he made 25 years ago with Owen Wilson. And, sure, technically there already was a sequel to that – the London-set Shanghai Knights – but that was too fancy. Forget it was ever made and do another kung-fu cowboy film, by presidential decree.And surely Trump’s love of Bloodsport means that a Van Dammeissance is due. Let’s have a Timecop 2. Let’s have a second Double Impact where the Van Damme twins discover a secret triplet. Let’s have a fourth Cyborg. Let’s have a fifth Universal Soldier. I realise that the original was a Steven Seagal film, but let’s make a sequel to 2002’s Half Past Dead starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Let’s call it Quarter to Dead. This is what the American people deserve.You’re really spoiling us: Trump miscasts Gibson, Stallone and Voight by making them mere ambassadorsRead moreOf course, this would only be the starter for something that Trump has been slowly piecing together for a while now. Remember back in January, when Trumpmade Sylvester Stallone a special ambassadorto Hollywood? Do you think he did this because he truly thinks that Stallone has enough heft to encourage more US-based film production? Or, as I suspect, did he do it because he is desperate to see Tango & Cash 2 rushed into production?It has to be the latter. You could set a million quantum computers to work for a decade, and they would all agree that, whichever way you look at it, Tango & Cash is Trump’s favourite Stallone film. It’s not Rambo, because that series started with too much liberal hand-wringing. It’s not Rocky, because that series started with the hero losing. No, it has to be Tango & Cash.Like Trump, Tango & Cash is from the 80s. Like Trump, it has a funny name. Like Trump, it was hated by the critics but loved by enough of a bewilderingly large percentage of the population to turn a profit. Tango & Cash is everything that Trump wants in a film. It’s dumb. It’s violent. It barely makes sense. Nobody has ever clamoured for a sequel to Tango & Cash but, mark my words, we will have one by the time Trump leaves office.Explore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsDonald TrumpJackie ChanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But they were dancing together – two beings in the afternoon sunlight, having their own conversation’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 26 Nov 2025 09.54 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 12.13 ESTShareIam an only child. My father was killed in a car accident when I was 14 and my mother was 47. We were really tightly bonded after that. She worked at a university and was an artist: she painted and carved birds. She was a wonderful person, who lit up a room and was someone everyone wanted to be around. She was very giving.Later in life, she developed dementia. I left my teaching position to stay home and look after her. She was very active – she would go outside and rip up bulbs, put the horses in the wrong stalls. It was very stressful to come home – I would enter the driveway and think: “Oh my word!”I didn’t have any previous experience of dementia, and I was thinking it wouldn’t be for long – but of course it was. The first year was slow. She would say she was losing her mind, and it made her sad. I got depressed too and stopped making pictures. To photograph my mother felt like sacrilege. I thought it would be voyeuristic. Then a friend, Joni, who also knew her, set me a challenge to take my mother’s picture. I turned to my mother on the couch and said: “We’re going to make a picture for Joni.” Then she did a remarkable thing: she turned to face the window and fluffed up her hair. That shocked me. She said: “Why not – what else are we doing?” That changed everything.I got up in the night and she had moved the fridge, stacked the chairs on the couch, and was walking around nudeShe used to love being outside and we would go out whenever possible to make pictures. This image is of our dog – whom my mother wasn’t very fond of – a jack russell. Skipper loved the hose. My mother came out and they were dancing together, two beings in the sunlight of the afternoon, having their own conversation. Beautiful things like that just kept unfolding. It made the sadness and depression lessen for me.As the dementia developed, my mother would say she wanted to die, and ask me to take her there, as though it was a place we could travel to. We had a surreal life together for a few years. I couldn’t think about losing her; it never occurred to her she was also losing me. I remember her dancing to a Dolly Parton song, swaying her hips, and she was so beautiful it stopped me in my tracks. I was crying, watching and remembering her as my mother. She came over and gave me a big hug and said: “What are you crying about?”If I feel sadness, I feel there’s an equal amount of love – that’s been a helpful form of self-preservation. I couldn’t make pictures of the stained bedsheets and dark closets. This, with sunlight and happiness, is a very curated point of view – a lot has been omitted deliberately. The title of the book, Calling the Birds Home, comes from a day when I felt I couldn’t take on another thing: I got up in the middle of the night and she had moved the refrigerator to the middle of the room and stacked the chairs on the couch, and was walking around nude. I was so overwhelmed, I had to just throw my hands up, acknowledge our place within the universe and ask for support.Once she passed, five years ago, I discovered how much I missed nurturing and taking care of someone. The mother-daughter roles had been reversed. She was such a great mother, she made our life together as beautiful as possible throughout my childhood and beyond.When I started to share the pictures, it shifted to a universal experience – yes, it’s dire, but what I did with her was a new way to have a conversation when we were losing our ability to express our love. It helped us through a dark time. The pictures were secondary to that. She blossomed all the time for these pictures, she was up for it – that was part of her nature, and it didn’t change with dementia. I wish we could look at hard topics and also think about how to get through them. I hope this work helps motivate someone to break through the sadness and go and do something with someone they love.Calling the Birds Home is published by L’ArtiereView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cheryle St OngeCheryle St Onge’s CVBorn:Worcester, MassachusettsHigh point:“The day I bought my first 8x10 view camera.

For me, Sirāt is the most overpraised movie of the year – exasperating and bizarre in ways that become less and less interesting and more and more ridiculous as the film wears on.There is a moment of tragic horror halfway through the action that is not absorbed or clarified and whose (presumed) emotional and spiritual consequences are not conveyed. It simply looks coercive and even slightly farcical. The later explosions in the desert are, frankly, Pythonesque. And yet, as withLaxe’s earlier film Mimosasthere are some wonderful visual moments and stylish shots of the Moroccan desert landscape. Veteran Spanish actor Sergi López gives Sirāt some ballast.Sirātis the Arabic word for the narrow, perilous path that takes you to paradise, and there is something interestingly ambiguous about the teeming crowds of people we initially see at a rave in the Moroccan desert. It’s a bravura setpiece. They look both like Dionysian ravers and lost souls writhing in hell.Two outsiders show up: middle-aged Luis (López) and his young son Esteban (Bruno Núñez Arjona) with their dog Pipa. (Esteban’s mother is not mentioned.) Luis pleadingly hands out leaflets with a photo to all the people there, asking desperately if they have seen his teen daughter, Mar, who vanished months before and was perhaps at a rave like this. They blearily shake their heads, some appearing faintly hostile to these interlopers, perhaps suspecting some sort of accusation, but some at least show a wary sympathy: Bigui (Richard “Bigui” Bellamy), Jade (Jade Oukid), Steff (Stefania Gadda) and Tonin (played by street-performer Tonin Janvier who has one leg, and later good-naturedly performs a song).Watch a trailer for SirātWhen the army arrives to break up the party, requisitioning the desert for military purposes, and attempts to shepherd everyone’s trucks away on an approved route, Bigui et al defiantly swerve out and drive away, heading for a second party somewhere in the remote vastness. Luis follows them in his car, sensing that the answer to Mar’s disappearance might lie in this direction. But should Luis be searching for Mar? She is an adult and may not want to be found.Well, the dual narrative possibilities and consequences fade away into nothingness as the story disappears into the sand, as does the question of whether the hippies and Luis could conceivably learn from each other. In their shock and despair after the tumultuous events that follow, they take psychoactive substances and dance to electronic music thumping out of their speakers. The film’s doors of perception remain closed. Sirāt is a path to nowhere, an improvised spectacle in the Sahara; it is very impressive in the opening 10 minutes but valueless as it proceeds, and a pointless mirage of unearned emotion.Sirāt is out now in the US, on 12 February in Australia and on 27 February in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDance musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Daniel Craig returns as private detective Benoit Blanc, in a slightly more serious mode than before, with not as many droll suth’n phrases and quirky faux-naif mannerisms, but rocking a longer hairstyle and handsomely tailored three-piece suit.Blanc arrives at a Catholic church in upstate New York to investigate the sensational murder of its presiding priest, Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, a ferocious clerical alpha male played by Josh Brolin, thundering his reactionary views from the pulpit. (That“Monsignor” titlecan only be bestowed by the pope incidentally: presumably Benedict XVI or John Paul II, not milksop liberals like Francis or Leo XIV.) And prime suspect is the sweet-natured, thoughtful junior priest Father Jud Duplenticy, amusingly played by Josh O’Connor, who was upset by the Monsignor’s heartless attitudes and was caught on video threatening to cut him out of the church like a cancer. Atheist Blanc faces off with the young priest, a worldview culture-clash which leads to an extraordinary encounter with the Resurrection itself.The situation is complicated by the fact that Mgr Wicks was adored by a close-knit group of cranky and troubled parishioners, a hilariously cartoony lineup with a few resemblances to personae from the first Knives Out film. Wheelchair-using cellist Simone Vivane (Cailee Spaeny) is stricken with illness like Jacqueline du Pré; failing sci-fi novelist Lee Ross (Andrew Scott) is trying to convert his interminable Substack into a masterpiece; Vera Draven (Kerry Washington) is a lawyer whose stepson Cy Draven (Daryl McCormack) is a Trumpian influencer; Nat Sharp (Jeremy Renner) is a doctor losing his battle with the bottle; and church housekeeper Martha Delacroix (Glenn Close) is fiercely loyal to the Monsignor and is in turn adored by the groundskeeper Samson Holt (Thomas Haden Church). By the end, there’s a motive for each.It is an absolutely sparkling array of acting talent, with everyone at the top of their game, and Johnson teases us with references to many “locked room” detective mysteries, including those by John Dickson Carr, Dorothy L Sayers and Agatha Christie; classic texts whose playful purpose here is probably to divert and mislead. As with the previous two Knives Out films, the enjoyment is, for me, most intense before the actual murder itself, when we see the characters joust and spark unencumbered by murder and suspicion. There are hilarious scenes when Mgr Wicks insists that poor Jud hears his confession, which turns out to be a upsettingly detailed litany of masturbation episodes. Jud’s own confession is a stunningly effective counterblast.Then we get the murder, and then … well, it’s still thoroughly enjoyable, but should probably be considered more of a deadpan-absurdist ensemble comedy than a whodunnit. It is not really a question of twist and counter-twist, with the finger of suspicion moving from one person to another; it just gets more and more bizarrely convoluted. As with the previous Knives Out films, the characters are not, in fact, equally important and equally capable of murder. An inner core of suspects emerges and their guilt discloses itself incrementally at the end, as opposed to being withheld for a final reveal. What a treat though, with cracking turns from one and all and O’Connor the first among equals.

It manages to be unsubtle without being powerful. His subject isChristy Salters Martin, who under the grinning tutelage of Don King became the world’s most successful female boxing champion in the 90s and 00s but faced a misogynist nightmare outside the ring.Boxing legend Christy Martin: ‘My husband told me for 20 years he would kill me’Read moreThe film fails to deliver the power of the traditional boxing movie, or the real importance of a story about domestic abuse and coercive control, or the sensory detail of true crime. It relies on the simple fact of a woman pioneeringly taking on what had once been solely a man’s sport and relapses into cliche. Christy, with her frizzy hair and brown contact lenses, doesn’t seem to plausibly develop as a character throughout the film, and it sometimes seems as if Michôd is slightly more engaged with her gargoyle of a husband-slash-manager Jim Martin, played byBen Fosterwith a standard-issue combover and paunch.The creepy Martin discovers Christy when she is nothing more than a high-school basketball enthusiast in the 1980s but with an amazing untrained gift for boxing. Christy’s reactionary homophobic mom Joyce is a cartoonish role on which Merritt Wever is wasted; she is intensely suspicious of Christy’s emotional relationships with young women and is delighted when Christy is bullied into accepting a marriage proposal from the overbearing and psychopathically jealous Martin. She effectively becomes complicit in Martin’s horrendous abuse, which involves Christy’s macabre forced participation in private sex bouts with men and porn videos. The growing nightmare of her marital situation runs alongside her increasing dominance of women’s boxing, especially once she is taken up by the shock-haired supremo himself Don King in a scene-stealing cameo from Chad Coleman.The film glides along initially with an unbroken string of euphoric victories for Christy which after a while become tiresome; the record shows that Christy did in fact lose occasionally and losses are how boxers learn and become better at their craft – and it’s also how boxing movies become interesting. It apparently wants to contrast Christy doing well in the ring but taking the punches, literal and otherwise, outside it, and can only just about bring itself to concede that she lost to Laila Ali, daughter of Muhammad Ali. But even here it flinches from actually showing the moment of loss itself.Sweeney has already shown what a superb and detailed performer she is inthe FBI interrogation movie Reality, but this is far inferior: a stodgy, lifeless piece of work.● Christy is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 November and in Australian cinemas on 8 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSydney SweeneyDomestic violenceBen FosterBoxingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Many complaints were made (“Our daughter’s hair has turned green and it’s sticking like glue,” says one phone recording) but the authorities – some speak here, including South West Water authority’s former head of operations – insisted the water was safe.

Electropop boasts Charlie XCX; statecraft, the Patels: Priti the shadow foreign secretary, Kash the FBI boss. And while the ones who go into politics have tended to be conservative, we now have a counterexample in Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who clinched the New York mayoralty at the beginning of this month.The anomaly is best explained by the politics of his father, Mahmood Mamdani. The apple, it seems, did not roll especially far down the postcolonial hillside. Mahmood, professor of government and anthropology at Columbia University, has long styled himself as the left’s answer to VS Naipaul. Where the Nobel-winning curmudgeon surveyed postcolonialAfricawith disdain, revelling in the wreckage of independence, Mamdani presents a more forgiving view: pathos instead of pity, paradox instead of despair. If independence didn’t live up to the promise, he argues, it was because the colonised had been dealt a losing hand.Mamdani’s own life, as this combined history and memoir suggests, has been a minor epic of exile and return. Raised in Kampala, he grew up in the insulated world of Uganda’s Indian community, living above society rather than in it. His was a landscape of Indian schools, Indian mosques and Indian cricket pitches. Interracial marriage was rare to the point of nonexistent.A scholarship to Pittsburgh was meant to lead to a career as an engineer, but he was waylaid by political science and a Harvard doctorate followed. When he returned home in 1972 to set himself up as a Ugandan academic, the country’s new dictator, Idi Amin, had other plans: all 80,000 south Asians were to be gone within 90 days. Amin, who as a child had been nursed by an Indian woman, came to despise the community as an empire within. Indians were the visible face of colonialism, running plantations and corner shops while the British themselves remained discreetly out of sight. It’s not surprising the expulsion was popular.Mamdani urges us to discard “media-driven preconceptions” and instead see Amin as an anti-colonial moderniserThere is, then, a touch of Stockholm syndrome in Mamdani’s attempt here to rehabilitate Amin. He tells us that the expulsions were aimed at the British, not Indians: “he did everything in his power to spare Asian lives”. That was little comfort, of course, to those expelled. One suspects that many Ugandan Indians, Priti Patel among them, turned permanently hostile to state power and identity politics as a result.At the outset, Mamdani urges us to discard “media-driven preconceptions” – the lurid dispatches of Observercorrespondents and the gothic tales of Amin’s supposed cannibalism – and instead see Amin as an anti-colonial moderniser. Amin, in this telling, destroyed landlord power, made black rule “meaningful” and even “outwitted Israel and Britain” – feats that earn him a place in Mamdani’s pantheon of liberation heroes. The corrective is bracing, but Mamdani over-eggs it. Amin was incontrovertibly a military despot under whose rule hundreds of thousands perished. His expulsion of Indians left Uganda short of milk, meat and medics; irony supplied the remedy when expatriates from India were imported to fill the gaps. True, Amin broke with Britain and Israel, who had manoeuvred him into power, though only to ally with Gaddafi and turn the region into a graveyard through military adventurism.There is, in Slow Poison, a neat inversion of heroes. Mamdani’s second target is the “preconception” that Yoweri Museveni rescued Uganda from Amin’s wreckage. Where Amin, he claims, united Ugandans, Museveni revived tribal politics, carving the country into ever smaller ethnic fiefdoms. Amin was the patriot who spurned western tutelage; Museveni, the technocrat who kowtowed to neoliberalism and the IMF.But is Mamdani tilting at windmills here? Museveni’s mixed-economy pragmatism may have multiplied Uganda’s output tenfold, but western commentators haven’t exactly turned a blind eye to hisanti-gay death warrants, constitutional chicanery, vote-rigging and dynastic succession by stealth.Slow Poison has its longueurs and meandering paraphrases. Whether you endure or enjoy it will depend largely on your politics. Mamdani hails Amin’s absurd antics – styling himself the King of Scotland; staging a mock fundraiser to save a bankrupt Britain; being borne aloft by white men in a sedan chair – as radical performance art. Perhaps. To me, it is simply tragic that, given the chance to build a nation, Amin chose instead to troll it.Slow Poison: Idi Amin, Yoweri Museveni, and the Making of the Ugandan State by Mahmood Mamdani is published by Harvard (£27.95).

Embittered, rude, apathetic, resentful of the success and happiness of others and intellectually snobbish, he’s a 48-year-old aspiring writer who makes ends meet, just about, working in an independent bookshop in a gentrifying part of LA.He worries about turning 50 having made nothing of his life. He notes, lugubriously, that he barely seems to get any writing done and that – having no gift for plot, characterisation or prose – the novel he claims to be trying to produce will be lousy anyway. He keeps bumping into old friends whose books are being published by hip independent presses or who have acquired nice girlfriends, or both. His teeth are in bad shape.He rails against the gentrification of the neighbourhood by large corporations and sheeplike hipsters. And he rages, above all, against the customers in the bookshop, who ask him stupid questions, buy copies of trendy books he considers bad, ask for directions to the toilets, insist on paying by credit card, block up the aisles talking noisily on their phones or, worse, attempt to engage him in friendly conversation. He is very rude to all of them, especially the ones with beards, and they complain about him on Yelp, and his boss in turn tells him off, which increases his bitterness.He keeps bumping into old friends whose books are being published or who have acquired nice girlfriends, or bothThat, for more than 300 pages, is about it. The book is a long, very repetitive monologue (we meet versions of the same riff on the annoyingness of addiction memoirs at least three times) which knowingly enacts the tedious stasis of which its narrator complains. It’s not without its moments. I liked, for instance, the sour footnote in which he says: “Rather than me wasting my time inserting the word ‘unfortunately’ into every statement, from now on the reader should just assume it is there.” (Shades of Martin Amis’s “Unless I specifically inform you otherwise, I’m always smoking another cigarette.”)But it doesn’t have the wacky charm ofBlack Booksor the volcanic wit of A Confederacy of Dunces, and I can’t help thinking that its contemporary digs – we meet Ben Lerner,Miranda July,Kim Gordonand Michelle Tea as “Len Berner”, “Samantha August”, “Gordon Kim” and “Michelle Coffee” – will date fast. Plus, that the annoying customers are effectively interchangeable – I lost count of how many asked the way to the loo – is baked into the text. Another footnote says: “I can’t spend hours coming up with a name for a character, especially one that isn’t going to appear again in this book. Bill will have to do.”Yet for all the show of insouciance, Tottenham’s prose is effortful. You get sentences such as: “Most of my contemporaries had moved on and were now established in their professional, creative and familial lives, whereas I had turned a corner and hit a wall, with the contrary values of youth hammered into place: a callow negativism matured to a dubious vintage, with a voluptuous bouquet of regret and a lingering aftertaste of self-disgust.” Parklife!The book that Sean is writing, incidentally, is the book that we are reading. A colleague who works in the coffee shop – called only “the Boy” – persuades our hero to show him the manuscript, and then slightly seems to regret it. I don’t know if Tottenham – an LA-dwelling Brit who has published poetry and exhibited as an artist – has worked in a bookshop, so can’t say if the reflexivity goes a layer deeper still.At one point, Sean discusses giving his narrator a name and says: “I was considering using Sean for his first name but a lot of people seem to dislike that name and it’s too phonetically close to my own name.” Sean may be “phonetically close” to John, but it’s phonetically identical to Sean, which is indeed what Sean is called in the book. This could be a postmodern masterstroke, or it could simply be another “can’t be bothered” shrug.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The Xbox 360 arrived on 22 November 2005 in the US and 2 December in the UK, about three months after I got my first job as a junior staff writer on GamesTM magazine. My memories of the night are hazy because a) it was a worryingly long time ago and b) there was a free bar, but I do remember that DJ Yoda played to a tragically deserted dancefloor, and everything was very green. My memories of the console itself, however, and the games I played on it, are still as clear as anXbox Crystal. It is up there withthe greatest consolesever.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In 2001, the first Xbox had muscled in on a scene dominated byJapanese consoles, upsetting the established order (it outsold Nintendo’s GameCube by a couple of million) and dragging console gaming into the online era with Xbox Live, an online multiplayer service that was leagues ahead of what the PlayStation 2 was doing. Nonetheless, the PS2 ended up selling over 150m to the original Xbox’s 25m. The Xbox 360, on the other hand, would sell over 80m, neck and neck with the PlayStation 3 for most of its eight-year life cycle (and well ahead in the US). It turned Xbox from an upstart into a market leader.In a very un-Microsoft way, the Xbox 360 was cool. Its design was interesting, an inwards double curve described by its designers as an “inhale”, with a swappable front faceplate. It had a memorably Y2K startup animation and clean, futuristic menus that brought messaging, friends lists and music. I remember finding Microsoft’s marketing powerfully cringe at the time – witness thisdeveloper video, featuring former Microsoft entertainment boss J Allard and his infamous earring, in which a guy juggles while saying the words “Three symmetric cores”. But, despite that, the machine they built felt modern and exciting. The controller, too, white with its pops of colour, was such a tremendous improvement on the uncomfortably gigantic original Xbox controller that it’s become a design standard. I know people who will still only use wired Xbox 360 pads to play PC games.Powerfully cringe … Microsoft’s Xbox 360 promo video.As the first properly, seamlessly connected console, it brought a lot of things together to form a sense of gamer identity: playing different games online under one unified gamertag; messages and social features, as well as the inspired idea of achievements, which created a personal gaming history via the little challenges you completed in everything you played. (Sony would soon copy this with trophies.) Attaching a number to this, the gamerscore, was devilish genius, encouraging players to compete for ultimately meaningless clout, and creating a powerful incentive for people to stick with the console rather than buying games elsewhere. TheXbox360 was the first console to understand that people stay where their friends are. If you had the choice between buying a game on PS3 or 360, you’d choose 360 because that’s where everyone else was playing.By late 2006, when a complacent Sony released an overpriced and awkward-looking follow-up to the PlayStation 2, the Xbox 360 had already had a year to convert people to its vision for high-definition gaming. People had already built up a collection of games and an online identity that was tied to Xbox. The big third-party game publishers, who found the PS3’s proprietary technology awkward to develop for, had started to prioritise Xbox for multi-platform games. The 360 never cracked Japan, but in the rest of the world it became the default console, an extraordinary thing for Microsoft to achieve considering how comprehensively Sony had dominated the previous two generations with the PlayStation.View image in fullscreenThe weird, monochrome realm of Limbo.Photograph: TriplePointXbox Live Arcade also helped to usher in the modern era of indie games. Between the 90s and the late 00s, publishers and bricks-and-mortar retailers largely controlled which games did and didn’t make it into players’ hands, especially on consoles. In 2008, Xbox Live Arcade started letting people download smaller, cheaper games direct to their consoles – no shop or publisher required. It did for console gaming what Steam would later do on PC, getting players comfortable with the idea of digital distribution. Games released via the arcade includedGeometry Wars, Braid, Limbo, Bastion and, just as importantly, the best-ever digital version of Uno. I remember sinking many, many hours into Oblivion, Mass Effect and BioShock in my late teens, but I also eagerly awaited each new batch of Xbox Live Arcade games.Looking back, the architects of the Xbox 360 really understood how and why people played games, and what they wanted from a next-generation console at the time. They understood how the internet could transform not just multiplayer gaming, but the social experience around games, and the way people found and bought them. This knowledge was apparently lost in a few short years, because when Microsoft announced the Xbox One in 2013, it was an absolute shitshow. By then, Microsoft apparently thought that people wanted to play games while watching sports picture-in-picture, as a mandatory connected camera watched your every move.Microsoft has never again come close to market leadership in video games. A resurgent Sony took all the best lessons from the Xbox 360 and packaged them into the PlayStation 4, and then the Nintendo Switch arrived in 2018 and blew everything else out of the water. With Xbox now in distant third place in the waning console wars, it seems to see its future as aquasi-monopolistic video game subscription service, rather than a hardware maker. Series that defined the 360 era, such as Halo and Gears of War, are now playable on PC and PlayStation. Others, such as Fable, have been languishing for over a decade.The 360 era was an exciting time in games, a period of great change and competition brought about by online gaming. The console market was a lot smaller back then, but also less predictable. There was still room for those “interesting, 7/10” B-games that sometimes proved even more memorable than the blockbusters when free-to-play games were not yet a thing – games were yet to consolidate into the five established mega-franchises that now dominate everything. And, in bringing indie games to console players, it genuinely changed the trajectory of my gaming taste.What to playView image in fullscreenBath your grain … Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.Photograph: Bizarre Creations/SteamWriting about Xbox Live Arcade had me hankering forGeometry Wars: Retro Evolved, the spectacularly compulsive Xbox Live Arcadetop-down shooterthat looks like fireworks and feels like a sensory bath for your brain.

As Nintendo’s moustachioed plumber lords it up from his gilded go-kart, everyone from Crash Bandicoot to Sonic and Garfield has tried – and failed – to skid their way on to the podium. Now with no one left to challenge its karting dominance,Nintendois attempting to beat itself at its own game.The unexpected sequel to a critically panned 2003 GameCube game, Kirby Air Riders has the pink squishball and friends hanging on for dear life to floating race machines. With no Grand Prix to compete in, in the game’s titular mode you choose a track and compete to be the first of six players to cross the finish line, spin-attacking each other and unleashing weapons and special abilities to create cutesy, colourful chaos.You accelerate automatically at all times, commanding the analogue stick to boost around corners, aiming the direction of your drift with a well-timed flick. Air Riders has a surprisingly steep learning curve: ittook me an hour to stop hurtling into walls. But once you’ve learned to let go (of the stick) and start drifting like a pro, it reveals a satisfyingly zen, minimalist approach to competitive racing.Where Sonic’s 2025 kart outing saw him recruit Minecraft’s Steve, VTuber Hatsune Miku and Yakuza’s Kiryu to its ranks, Air Riders has you competing against such legendary characters as a sentient rock, a slime with googly eyes and someone called Chef Kawasaki. Remember Lolo and Lala? … No? Well, they’re here! But where the roster is lacking, the machines give Air Riders surprising variety and depth, letting you swap between enemy-destroying tanks and glide-happy paper aeroplanes.Each track has personality and spectacle, and there’s a strong sense of visual cohesion that was sorely lacking in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds earlier this year. The art style really shines in Air Riders’ story mode, Road Trip. It’s the best single player mode that director Masahiro Sakurai (who also leads Smash Bros) has ever concocted, packed with surreal boss fights, cleverly modified races and oddly high-budget cutscenes, like a dream you might have after gobbling some too much cheese before bedtime.The big multiplayer mode, City Trials, however, is a let-down. A chaotic collision of Battle Royale-esque resource gathering followed by a Mario party-esque mini game showdown, it feels bafflingly pointless: you spend five minutes powering up for a mini game that ends in seconds. The final mode – Top Ride – offers up a simplified version of the main event, in which you race from a bird’s eye view in a Micro Machines-inspired melee. It’s fun, if shallow.What Air Riders lacks in modes, it makes up for in charm. There are a heap of customisation options, allowing you to pimp your ride with unlockable stickers and alternative colour schemes – you can even hang a plushie from your machine like a Kirby-branded Labubu.This is a tightly focused game that reminds me of Nintendo’s fun-first NES-era game design – for better and for worse. It has a sprinkling of Sakurai magic and oodles of visual panache, but at full price it is – like Kirby – a little puffed-up.Kirby Air Riders is out now; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesRacing gamesNintendoNintendo Switch 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

They talk about manipulating their audience – and correcting historyFlorence HallettWed 26 Nov 2025 09.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 11.52 ESTShareSomerset House in London used to be known as the “national beehive”, says artist and film-makerOnyeka Igwe, as she leads the way through corridors and down stone steps to her studio in the building’s inner reaches. As the former home of the Inland Revenue, and the General Register Office responsible for recording births, deaths and marriages, Somerset House once held all the information necessary to tax and manage the population. “There were so many workers here,” Igwe says.Archives are the prosaic raw materials of her films – stories of resistance, dispossession and the power of communal activism for which she and fellow London-born and -based artist, writerand musicianMorgan Quaintancehave been made joint recipients of the2025 Film London Jarman award.Like Igwe, Quaintance is fascinated by history, which surfaces and recedes in his films in the random, apparently illogical way that it does in our individual and collective consciousness. InRepetitions, one of two films commended by the jury of art and film world experts, Quaintance gathers the flotsam and jetsam of 30 years of personal history – a scan of his injured knee, feet on a staircase, a crouching boy – mixing them with footage of Black feminist activists from a century ago, and the voice of a campaigner for workers’ rights during the Covid pandemic.View image in fullscreenSpeculative past … a still from A Radical Duet (2023) by Onyeka Igwe.Photograph: Onyeka IgweInA Radical Duet, Igwe finds the gaps in the history of the burgeoning anticolonial movement in 1940s London, to imagine the meeting of two Black female activists who might have crossed paths. In the spaces left blank by archives, books and blue plaques, Igwe places a speculative past, in a film that draws the threads of history through to the here and now.When we meet, a few days before the announcement, neither Igwe nor Quaintance knows that they have won, but as they have been previously shortlisted, the pair maintain the cool demeanour of old hands.Presented annually, and inspired by the lateDerek Jarman, the award, which includes a £10,000 cash prize, recognises and supports artists working with moving images. This is the first time since its inception in 2008 that the award has been presented jointly, with the prize money split between the two winners.Both artists work across different media, but are equally convinced of the unique power of film: “It’s thriving, it’s vibrant, and some of the best work is happening in this country,” says Quaintance. Igwe, whose current Tate Britain exhibition,Our Generous Mother, includes sculpture, film and projected slides, enjoys film’s capacity to accommodate different forms, but says: “It’s important to know why something is a film, as opposed to an article or a poem.”View image in fullscreen‘Some of the best work is happening in this country’ …  Jarman prize winners  Onyeka Igwe and Morgan Quaintance.While for Igwe, history is an anchor in the present, for Quaintance, it’s a point of friction on which an individual is snagged and forced into an encounter with a much bigger picture. “There’s this new idea that you have to be collectively conscious. You have to be thinking, ‘Where do I stand in relation to world events?’” he says. “We’re all supposed to be on a world vigil, you know? I’m not lamenting it, I’m just fascinated by it. It’s a contemporary condition.”As a medium that perhaps more than any other commands the full and unmediated attention of an audience, and at a time when viewers are more visually sophisticated than ever, film is the ideal way to assess our ability to affect others beyond our immediate circle.Repetitions, a film that stutters and loops like a VHS held on pause, is a testing experience for viewers presented with a deconstructed film in which sound, time and image are separated and distorted. “From a formal perspective, I was interested in how far you can loop something, and what that does to a viewer,” Quaintance says. “Maybe I can push you into a hypnotic state. I can frustrate you, or make you have a sense of expectation, or push you towards boredom. These are all things that are going to actively manipulate you as you’re watching something.”Asked about future plans that might be brought into being with the prize money, Quaintance points to his exhibition Available Light, at Chelsea Space in London, in which a film serves as the central point of a bigger touring project about the difficulties of modern urban living. For Igwe, an adaptation of a Doris Lessing novel, and the next chapter of A Radical Duet are calling her.But it’s their interest in grassroots activism that’s at the root of their shared passion for the English civil war. For Igwe, it began at school, when she realised that “people had these proto-communist ideas, they were thinking about alternative, radical ways of living that people are still thinking about today. That sparked an interest in thinking about the present through history.”“I would love to direct a drama on the English civil war,” says Quaintance. “I’d like to do something like Steve McQueen’s Small Axe tracking from the civil war to today.” It might be the ideal way to invest their shared winnings.Onyeka Igwe: Our Generous Motheris at Tate Britain, London, until 17 May.Morgan Quaintance: Available Lightis at Chelsea Space, London, until 12 December.The work of all the shortlisted nominees can be seen at Whitechapel Gallery, London, until 14 December.Explore more on these topicsArtJarman awardDerek JarmanAwards and prizesTate BritainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Instead, there’s an ailing pot plant and a bucket to catch the drips. It’s the understudies’ lair in a West End production ofJulius Caesar. Some big name plays Caesar (consensus is he’s a bit of a dick), while our guys cover the chief assassins. They don’t even get their own names here – just Understudy Brutus and Understudy Cassius.Night after night they skulk, waiting for the call that never comes, the show Tannoy an implacable reminder of the parade passing them by. For the show’s 100th performance, they celebrate with party hats, microwave popcorn and a run-through of the play they may never deliver for real.View image in fullscreenWaiting for the call that never comes … Adam Goodbody and John Chisham.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhy should only stars get to shine? The production itself, huff the understudies, isn’t up to much. They might save it, if they only had the chance. They quietly wish that someone would really break a leg – what if they’re not just killing time but, possibly, also one of the leads?Actor Adam Goodbody founded Buzz Studios in memory of his auntBuzz, pioneering director of “studio Shakespeare”, who died 50 years ago. In the company’s debut show, his Understudy Cassius is over-prepared, line-sharp; John Chisham’s slouching colleague spikes his tea with whisky. They zip through the script with varying degrees of intensity, paraphrase and chatty commentary.The pair, who devised the play with director Júlia Levai, smartly identify how comradeship turns competitive in Shakespeare – the assassination marks the moment when Brutus and Cassius are closest and yet when their bond starts to shred. In Levai’s inventive production, the drab room (design by Tomás Palmer) cracks open to phantasms and hideous dreams, and the captioning goes wild.Although bold in form, Petty Men feels like a narrow reading of the play, circling around personal ambition rather than political conviction. Julius Caesar is a play for our No Kings era. Murder to save the state is one thing; but however highly charged the bubble of a theatre production seems, it can’t matter as much as the fate of actual Rome.AtArcola theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatreJulius CaesarreviewsShareReuse this content"

Three actors perform this zesty bildungsroman about a Victorian boy’s travails through misfortune, adventure – and a formative trip to Yarmouth.Adapted and directed by Abigail Pickard Price, who was behind last year’sthree-person Pride and Prejudice, this is so much more than a parlour game. Produced by the Guildford Shakespeare Company, it is performed by Luke Barton (from Pride and Prejudice), Louise Beresford and Eddy Payne, and bears the quick-witted theatricality of the old Reduced Shakespeare Company. Like them, it retains the essence of the original, whittled down, with delightful dollops of mischief and invention.Scene changes are fleet, evoked by a swivel of suitcases, from which props are lifted, but which also gesture at David’s travels into adulthood. Yarmouth, where he meets Emily, Ham and Co, is conjured with waves unwound from the folds of Emily’s turquoise dress. David’s stepfather, Edward Murdstone, is represented by a hat and coat puppet; this facelessness renders him convincingly imposing as he inflicts his violent “firmness” on his stepson.View image in fullscreenComic eccentricity … (from left) Louise Beresford, Luke Barton and Eddy Payne in David Copperfield at Jermyn Street theatre, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThere are some plot omissions and minor characters missing, while David’s attraction to Emily isn’t given time to take hold emotionally. But it is remarkable how much of Dickens’ densely plotted story and great sprawl of characters three actors manage to juggle, and so charmingly.David is played by Payne, who has both the bearing of a boy and man. Barton brings excellent physical comedy to his transformations – from the matronly Peggotty to Micawber, Spenlow and more. Beresford is bewitching as she shuttles between David’s “child-wife” Dora to his rakish school-friend Steerforth, among others.Sometimes they change costumes on stage, sometimes switch between characters by donning different hats. Only on a few occasions does it feel too frenetic. In its comic eccentricity, it isreminiscent of Armando Iannucci’s film. The tragic notes of the story are struck too, in the fates of Emily, Ham and David’s various losses.Never mind the ghost of Christmas past. David Copperfield brings the Dickens magic here.AtJermyn Street theatre, London, until 20 December.Explore more on these topicsTheatreCharles DickensJermyn Street TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

The Polish pianist and composer’s erudite yet accessible work often defies genres, appealing to classical, jazz and electronic aficionados alike. This concert comprised two 40-minute premieres and fell pretty firmly into the classical category, yet the lively audience skewed significantly younger than the Brahms and Beethoven crowd. Stylishly performed by the envelope-pushing Manchester Collective, it felt like quite the happening.Shining occupied the first half, a piece devised for the kind of 12-piece band favoured by Steve Reich and Philip Glass. It’s based on a short story by Jon Fosse; a stream of consciousness tale of a man lost in the woods at night. Opening with sinister discords on bass clarinet, bassoon and horn, its motifs shifted and spun. A pall of smoke and half-lit players conjured images of a ghost story told around a campfire at midnight.Later, motoric rhythms kicked in, with instruments poking their heads above water only to be submerged again in the undertow. At one point bows bounced off strings like twigs tapping on a windowpane. As with the best minimalist music, Shining draws you in, heightening the senses to each and every rhythmic or harmonic shift.View image in fullscreenAbsorbing … Hania Rani at Barbican Hall, London.Photograph: Sian O’ConnorNon Fiction, Rani’s five-years-in-the-making piano concerto, was inspired by the sketchbooks of Josima Feldschuh, a young pianist forced into the Warsaw ghetto in 1940. The music – frequently ethereal, occasionally sombre and incorporating aleatoric passages – channels human resilience in the face of oppression. In her eloquent program note, the composer speaks of its contemporary resonances.On paper it’s as absorbing a work as Shining. The soloist – Rani herself – juggled upright and grand pianos, all the while pitted against a multihued 47-piece orchestra including mournful soprano saxophone, busy harp, bass and alto flutes, celesta and electronic tape. At its haunting best, its unrooted harmonies framed sepia-tinted snapshots emerging from the distorting mists of time. In practice, however, balance issues scuppered any feeling of a concerto, the piano drowned in the lavish orchestration. A shame, because otherwise this rather beautiful music had a great deal to say.Repeated on 26 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanPolandreviewsShareReuse this content"

As the vivid, extraordinary works they triggered go on show, the playwright looks backClaire ArmitsteadWed 26 Nov 2025 11.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 12.12 ESTShareIn the summer of 2004, Paula Rego wrote to Martin McDonagh asking for permission to name some pictures after his playThe Pillowman. His shocking investigation into the relationship between art and life featured two brothers under interrogation for the torture and murder of children. One is a writer whose stories are summarised by an investigator as: “A hundred and one ways to skewer a fucking five-year-old.”Rego, then a 69-year-old grandmother as well as a world famous artist, had been taken to see the play at the NationalTheatrein London by one of her daughters, who knew it would resonate with her. “The brutality and beauty and humour rang very true and like something I had known all my life,” she wrote to McDonagh. “I am actually Portuguese, although I have lived in London for 50 years, and our stories are brusque and cruel like yours.”‘She was drawn to the idea that your foibles could feed off you like parasites’The Pillowman is set in a totalitarian state in which people’s imagination is ruthlessly policed. When Rego was growing up, Portugal was under the dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar, who controlled a deeply conservative society for more than three decades with the help of his secret police. Her identification with the play was so strong that she had gone so far as to make her own “pillowman”, a life-size doll made of cushions stuffed into old tights, as the model for the central panel of a triptych that was to beexhibited at Tate Britainthat autumn.View image in fullscreenCushions stuffed into tights ... the life-size Pillowman that Rego made in the studio that is now her archive.Photograph: Nick Willing/© Estate of Paula Rego. Courtesy Ostrich Arts Ltd and Cristea Roberts GallerySo began an excitable, almost childlike correspondence that culminated in McDonagh ransacking his bottom drawer for more stories she could use, while floating the idea of a more formal collaboration on a picture book in the future. “Finally,” he wrote in February 2005, “I’m sending you some stories. Now listen, they were written quite a few years ago and some are very young and silly and none of them are well written. But some of them have interesting images, maybe, so if anything takes your fancy let me know.” He wouldn’t be able to do anything for a while, he added, because he was off to New York to restage The Pillowman on Broadway.Rego’s pillowman, his bulgy hippopotamus head flopping on his chest above white wellington boots, still lounges on a grubby sofa in the north London studio that has become her archive since her death in 2022. Under the spell of a place where so much great work was made, it feels as if he’s keeping watch while the artworks inspired by McDonagh’s stories are bundled up for exhibition at London’s Cristea Roberts Gallery.The show focuses on a three-year period of Rego’s output, from 2005 to 2007, when she developed a practice of drawing and painting from scenarios that she assembled in her studio with the help of her assistant,Lila Nunes, who also posed for many of them. Though Rego didn’t consider these constructions to be art in their own right, neither did she discard them when their work was done. Some of the puppets involved, which she calledbonecos– the Portuguese word for dolls – will be on display for the first time.View image in fullscreenDisturbing … Adam Godley and David Tennant in The Pillowman.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyAt the heart of this output was the “McDonagh series”, based on the stories that McDonagh himself explains were written in his 20s, more as the outlines of a potential short film series than as publishable pieces of work. The only time they had previously seen the light of day was when he showed a few of them to the Pillowman cast as examples of the sorts of stories under investigation in the play.The imaginative connection between the mature artist and the young playwright and film-maker – whose work has since gone on to sweep up awards on both sides of the Atlantic – is startlingly powerful, and ranges from a typewriting monkey to a man with turtles for hands. It doesn’t follow straight lines. But of the four stories that Rego chose from the dozens she was sent, one in particular drove straight to the heart of one of her own enduring obsessions.The story involved a forest full of babies calling piteously out to the conscience of the mother who had aborted them. “It is a very perverse story, against what I stand for, so I don’t know why I did it,” she wrote at the time. There is no forest in the paintings she made in response. In one, a woman is slumped in a bathroom with fancy floral wallpaper, a foetus in her lap. In another, a young mother cradling a baby sits on a toilet with the bloody remnants of an abortion in a bowl at her feet.View image in fullscreen‘I’m sending you some stories. Some are very silly and none of them are well written’ … Martin McDonagh.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianAs an art student at London’s Slade in the early 1950s, Rego had several backstreet abortions herself, before returning to her family home in Portugal to give birth to her first daughter, in a society hellbent on outlawing young women like her. She felt no guilt, she recalled; merely anger about the unnecessary pain, misery and danger inflicted. It was a subject to which she would return time and again, in artworks that would play a part in galvanising the Portuguese people to overthrow their country’s ban on abortion.In a film,Secrets & Stories, made by her son Nick Willing towards the end of her life, Rego talked about her outrage after the decriminalisation of abortion was rejected in a 1998 referendum. When a second referendum was scheduled for 2007, she printed up eight etchings for distribution to the national and local press. The Portuguese president at the time, Jorge Sampaio, is among those who testify in the film to the works’ role in changing public opinion.Although Rego rarely made appearances in her own paintings, the autobiographical content is there for those who know what to look for, according to Willing – whose responsibilities for his mother’s legacy include caring for an archive of several thousand works, overseeing 23 exhibitions around the world this year, and looking after a museum, theCasa das Histórias Paula Rego, which was founded in 2009 near her old family home.View image in fullscreenPersonal traumas … Rego in her London studio in 2004.Photograph: Independent/AlamyFor all its apparent grotesquery, Pillowman personifies Rego’s affection for her industrialist father, who brought his family up on aquinta– country estate – on the Portuguese riviera, where their neighbours included celebrities and royalty. The triptych contains references toSaint-Exupéry’s Little Prince, and to the exiled king of Italy, who was known to pick up young male sex workers on the beach.After her father’s death, the family’s electronics business went bust and thequintahad to be sold – a traumatic series of events that is dramatised in another picture from the McDonagh series. The story it is based on tells of a piglet’s futile prayers to be saved from slaughter by a scarecrow it had earlier rescued from a wildfire. Rego represents the scarecrow as a crucified woman with a cow’s skull, who towers above a decapitated pig’s head, next to a sleeping girl. In the background the sky is burning. As a child, says Willing, Rego was traumatised by the slaughter of a pig she had come to love. The sleeping girl represents her guilt at allowing her whole inheritance to go up in flames, although the fault wasn’t in fact hers but her husband’s. Victor Willing, who had been a star student at the Slade when they met, disastrously thought he could run the family business himself. Its failure forced Rego to beg for grants to keep their young family afloat.View image in fullscreenMysterious works … Rego’s Camouflaged Hands, 2006.Photograph: © Estate of Paula Rego. Courtesy Ostrich Arts Ltd and Cristea Roberts GalleryThe most mysterious picture to emerge from the McDonagh collaboration is the one with a man who has turtles in place of hands. Willing is reluctant to overexplain it, because Rego never explained it to him. But he believes it has something to do with the lifelong depression from which she suffered, as her beloved father had before her. “I think she was very drawn to the idea that the things that weigh you down – like depression or all your foibles and idiosyncrasies – they’re part of you, but they’re also living creatures that feed off you, like parasites. They are a curse but also a privilege and, in getting rid of them, you perish,” he says.Flying mermaids and moonlit dancers – Paula Rego: a life in picturesRead moreThe three years on which the exhibition focuses were among the most productive of Rego’s life, says Willing, resulting in an enormous number of pastels and prints. “She had a particularly purple patch with theMartin McDonaghstories, and he gets a lot of credit for exciting in my mother perhaps her most accomplished work.”The picture book sadly never materialised. “It would’ve been a dream, though I think that dream was mostly in my head,” says McDonagh. “But to be a tiny part of the art of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century is mind-blowing to me. I still can’t really believe it.”Paula Rego: Drawing from Life is atCristea Roberts Gallery, London, from 27 November to 17 January.

The painter and I are in his studio in a village outside Oxford, surrounded by nude portraits of his wife, the novelistKiran Millwood Hargrave. “I wanted to ask, ‘What does it mean as a male artist to be looking at the female figure? And where does the agency sit?’”We have been talking aboutTitian’s Poesie series, how those paintings – commissioned by the most powerful man in the world at the time, King Philip II of Spain – fetishise the naked female body. “Obviously there’s other things going on in them … I think Titian’s often prodding at morality and power,” De Freston says.Titian’s works are a central inspiration for works on display as part of Poíēsis, De Freston’s first major exhibition at London’s Varvara Roza Galleries. He has lifted some of Titian’s figures on to his own canvases, playing with the idea of the male gaze.View image in fullscreenOn the Edge of the Forest.Photograph: Tom de Freston/Peter Mallet PhotographyThese large-scale paintings are alongside those of Millwood Hargrave at various stages of pregnancy, created as the couple endured seven pregnancy losses before the birth of their daughter, Coral, in 2023. De Freston wrote about the miscarriages – and Titian – in his acclaimed book Strange Bodies, but these paintings were initially not intended to be exhibited, but were rather just a way of processing his own grief. “It was like the studio was my space to work through stuff that was beyond language, without burdening Kiran with it.”It was also an act of empathy. Over the years, De Freston has painted Millwood Hargrave in a range of mythological guises, but it is the story of Eurydice and Orpheus that resonated the most: her unreachability, his need to look to her, questions about the distances between men and women and of course the feeling of being on the threshold of an underworld of grief and loss, hoping for a pregnancy resulting in a live birth.You can’t deny the male gaze in these works: it’s there. “You’re trying to get to this figure, or to their unseen internal world. And even though you’re intimately connected to them, you can’t,” he explains. The subject’s unreachability, in other words, is the whole point.Despite efforts to reframe it, the dynamic between a male artist and his female muse still holds powerful sway in many people’s minds, but De Freston and Millwood Hargrave’s relationship is not one of “active artist and passive subject”. Rather, she is a collaborator. “Her voice is hugely present in the work,” says De Freston.“These aren’t posed,” agrees Millwood Hargrave, when we speak by phone a few days later. “They are all from photographs that he took in the domestic space throughout my pregnancies.” I ask her if such intimacy being made public feels exposing in any way. “When he first talked to me about using these photographs, I was just excited, because this body of work is the most beautiful I’ve ever seen Tom create,” she says. “They’re not sexualised. They’re worshipful and considered and you can feel the love in them.”View image in fullscreenBoth of Us Sorting Shadows, 2024.Photograph: Tom de Freston/Peter Mallet PhotographyExplorations of pregnancy and especially of miscarriage still feel quite rare in visual art. De Freston has made a bold attempt at empathy and succeeded in capturing that mix of grief and hope. Furthermore, they record a time that is precious. “They do feel like elegies,” says Millwood Hargrave. “I think any painting feels like an act of mourning anyway, because you’re trying to capture something that is gone.

Instead, he was flooded with a sense of wonder and connection. “There was a sudden shattering of the lie of the individual,” he says. “You have this sense of you as this artist, with the importance of your vision of the world. And obviously, having a child, you become so intimately aware of the interconnectedness of everything.”The work he made before parenthood was, by his own admission, very heavy. These paintings are far more hopeful. A lot of magical thinking goes on in pregnancy, especially when you’ve had losses. De Freston agrees: “I think of them as ritualistic, like spells. And in a kind of secular way, like prayers.”Tom de Freston: Poíēsiswill be at Varvara Roza Galleries, London, from 30 November to 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtExhibitionsPregnancyMiscarriageFamilyHealth & wellbeinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

French drama The Hunt was due to be released on 3 December, but it has been hit by allegations of similarity to a 1976 film adaptation of a novel, Shoot.The Hunt stars Cannes and three-time César award winner Benoît Magimel and two-time César winner Mélanie Laurent, who has featured in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds. But press releases about The Hunt, as well as its official trailers, have now been removed from Apple’s site.“The broadcast of our series The Hunt has been temporarily postponed,” said production company Gaumont in a statement. “We are currently conducting a thorough review to address any questions related to our production. We take intellectual property matters very seriously.”According to a press release sent out by Apple, The Hunt (known in French as À l’Ombre des Forêts) follows Franck (Magimel) and his longtime friends, who spend weekends hunting – until they find themselves targeted by another group of hunters, who are seemingly stalking them even after they return from their trip.Shoot, the work which The Hunt has been accused of bearing similarities to, was a thriller written by Douglas Fairbairn in 1973, and was turned into a US/Canadian movie starring Cliff Robertson and Ernest Borgnine. The synopsis of the plot on Goodreads is as follows:Rex is an uber-macho hunter who, together with four equally testosterone-addled buddies, embarks on a hunting trip in the Canadian wilderness. But their weekend is cut short by a rival band of hunters they encounter in the forest, one of whom inexplicably takes a potshot at Rex’s party and grazes the head of one of his buddies. Another of Rex’s friends returns fire, killing the shooter. From there Rex and company scurry off and head back to civilisation. Rex, however, becomes convinced that the dead man’s companions are going to come after him and his friends.According toAppleInsider, which reported the news on Tuesday, the allegations were first reported by French media expert Clément Garin.The Hunt is not the first Apple TV show to have been pulled from launch at short notice this year. Jessica Chastain’s series The Savant waspostponedthree days before its September air date, followingthe shooting of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. The Savant stars Chastain as a top-secret investigator who traces white supremacists and other hate groups online to prevent violent attacks.Its delay prompted Chastain to release an Instagram post stating that she and Apple were “not aligned on the decision to pause the release of The Savant”.“I’ve never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn’t so relevant, unfortunately it is,” she said. “The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honouring their courage feels more urgent than ever.” The show is still without a release date.Apple TV and Gaumont have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionApple TV+newsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Our favourite brands and retailers have been selling their 2025 calendars since the late summer. That might seem early, but many sold out long before the festive season started. In fact, theSpace NK beauty Advent calendar, which was my top recommendation, sold out at the end of September. Since then, my second-place pick fromCult Beautyhas also sold out. But don’t worry, there are still plenty of options to choose from below.Offering a selection of high-end cosmetics for less than their usual price, beauty Advent calendars have become a holy grail for the beauty obsessed. There are dozens to choose from at wildly different prices, some focusing on specific product types, and some filled with a mixture of bestsellers.To help with choice paralysis, I’ve been trawling the shelves for calendars filled with cult favourites suitable for various skin types and preferences, narrowing down the 10 best beauty Advent calendars of the 2025 season.While these Advent calendars can’t exactly be seen as a net positive for the environment, I also looked at their recyclability and for calendars with the broadest possible appeal, to avoid any wasted products.Current discountsThis W7 beauty Advent calendar is reduced by £3.£16.95 at AmazonThe Boots 24BeautyStars premium Advent calendar is reduced by £22.50.£127.50 at BootsThe Next 25 days of beauty Advent calendar is reduced by £10.£85 at NextThe Rituals Classic Advent calendar is reduced by £20.60.£82.40 at LookfantasticAt a glanceBest beauty Advent calendar overall:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendar£127.50 at BootsBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendar£205 at LushBest for product range:Next 25 days of beauty Advent calendar£85 at NextBest entry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendar£16.95 at AmazonBest skincare Advent calendar:Elemis Wonders Advent calendar£225 at ElemisWhy you should trust meI make a living testing health and beauty products, fromhair masksandhairdryerstobody moisturisersand concealers. That means I’m more familiar with the best formulations than many beauty fanatics.Testing hundreds of products means I’ve become an expert in all things skincare, hair care and makeup – the main contents of beauty Advent calendars. I also have a certification in cosmetic science, so I know how to identify the best products for specific skin and hair needs. As someone with sensitive skin, I also know which ingredients are likely to irritate, so I’ve only selected calendars where products are suitable for most people – so that nothing goes to waste.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianI judged each beauty Advent calendar on its product range, the broad usefulness of those products to most people, and the quality and sustainability of its packaging. I longlisted 27 of the most popular calendars from department stores and brands, narrowing down my options based on the contents of each calendar. I then shortlisted the 17 calendars with the best product range and value for money to test at home.Getting hands on with each calendar gave me a better idea of how it is packaged and delivered, its quality and feel, and the merits and size of the products inside. From a sustainability perspective, I made sure every calendar in this roundup was made from, and delivered in, domestically recyclable or reusable packaging.The goodies inside the calendars generally came in packaging that can be recycled at home, but all can otherwise be taken to one of many cosmetic recycling schemes, where pumps, sprays and bottles can be recycled properly. These include Space NK’s collaboration withHandle, and theRecycle at Boots scheme, which gets you extra points on your Advantage card for every empty you return.Most Advent calendars are designed to have broad appeal, but I also assessed how useful each selection of products would be. For makeup, that meant looking for neutral, wearable shades, rather than wild fluorescent colours. For hair care, I looked for formulas that help condition and improve all hair, rather than a specific hair type. I also liked to see gentler skin care products that help with common skin concerns, such as dullness, hydration levels and barrier health, although I didn’t mind an occasional anti-ageing product or spot treatment as these also have a wide appeal.Testing so many Advent calendars left me with more cosmetics and products than I could ever feasibly use. In instances where I wouldn’t or couldn’t use something from inside the calendars, I donated samples to theRedbridge Reach Outdomestic abuse service, where they could be given to women and young people seeking refuge. If you end up with products you won’t use, it’s always worth looking for a local beauty bank that will take donations or give items to friends and family.Here are the 13 beauty Advent calendars that came out on top in my tests.The best beauty Advent calendars in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianBest beauty Advent calendar overall:Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£127.50 at BootsWith my original top picks from Space NK and Cult Beauty out of stock, the eye-catching Boots Advent calendar is my next pick. It has a good range of full-size products from big-name brands, such as Drunk Elephant, Nars and Estée Lauder. It may not seem cheap at £127.50, but it’s filled with buzzy skincare products and makeup most beauty fanatics will want to try. The products inside are worth £612.50.Why we love itIt really looks the part, with a circus-themed chest design that opens to reveal individually wrapped goodies for every day until Christmas Eve. Despite its substantial design, it’s still fully recyclable.Highlights include a full-size viral Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide cream and an Estée Lauder cleansing gel. There’s also a mini-size Elemis cleansing balm – used together, these three make an effective, gentle evening skincare routine most people will love. You’ll also find crowd-pleaser fragrances from Sol de Janeiro and Floral Street.But it’s the makeup that really makes this calendar standout. There are seven full-size makeup products inside: an Iconic London face powder palette, a Fenty liquid lipstick, a Too Faced shimmery lip oil, a Mac lip liner, a Laneige lip balm, Nars light reflecting hydrating primer and a MilkMakeupmini highlighter (the latter of which stretches the meaning of “full size” a little). There are also minis of the Benefit Hoola bronzer, Mac Velvet Teddy lipstick and Laura Mercier loose-setting powder. All staples that will make great additions to any makeup bag.It’s a shame that …there are only two hair care products, so if this is what you’re after, opt for a different calendar.Number of products:25 (17 full size, 8 mini)Overall value:£612.50Packaging:domestically recyclableBlack Friday discountThe Boots 24 Beauty Stars premium Advent calendar is reduced by £22.50.£127.50 at BootsBest for bath lovers:Lush refillable Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£205 at LushIf your favourite part of the day is bath time, or you’re hoping to buy an Advent calendar the whole family can enjoy, this colourful option from Lush is my pick. Lush releases a few calendars each year, but this refillable chest is my recommendation: it’s perfect for storing your Lush products, and can be refilled for less money (and packaging) when the brand releases its 2026 calendar next year.Why we love itLush is most known for its fun, freshly made bath bombs – this calendar comes with bombs and bubble bars. Some have sweet scents, others are spiced; all of them are vegan and cruelty-free. If you’re a Lush lover, you’ll have no trouble working your way through this haul.You’ll also get four festive shower gels, two body lotions – including my longtime favourite festive Lush scent, Yog Nog – two soaps, a perfume and a lip scrub. For cosy festive evenings, there are also Lush socks and a Christmas Eve scented candle – no prizes for guessing which door that is hiding behind.This year’s refillable calendar was designed in partnership with Artbox London, a charity that runs workshops for people with learning disabilities and neurodivergent artists. Artist Shruti Gadhvi, who designed this year’s box, took inspiration from the practice of meditation, positive affirmations and the flowers and colours she sees on her travels.It’s a shame that …it’s quite expensive and it’s difficult to calculate the overall value since 10 items are exclusive.Number of products:25Overall value:not statedPackaging:refillable or domestically recyclable (bar the ribbon, which can be reused)Best for product range:Next 25 days of beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£85 at NextIn a world where many beauty Advent calendars cost hundreds of pounds, this more affordable calendar from Next is a breath of fresh air. Filled with 27 products, including hair care, skincare, nail care and makeup, it has a healthy dose of everything you need to upgrade your beauty routine.Why we love itRather than filling its doors with basic cleansers and moisturisers, this calendar features targeted skincare, such as a This Works brightening vitamin C serum, a Hello Sunday dark spot oil serum and BeautyPro’s retinol eye masks. Perfect if you already have your skincare basics nailed down.For makeup, the calendar offers a mini Benefit mascara, a full-sized Iconic London eyeshadow palette, a Pixi lip balm and a Delilah lip gloss. All of these are in neutral shades, so they should work with any skin tone and makeup collection.I also love that this calendar doesn’t forget about your nails. Inside, you’ll get an Opi nail lacquer in Bubble Bath and a Nails Inc repairing cuticle oil. The Nuxe multi-purpose dry oil is a particular highlight for me, adding a healthy glow to skin and hair. Throw in a body scrub, candle, perfume and more, and you’ve got a pretty perfect offering for the price.It’s a shame that …some of the skincare will be too niche. For example, if you don’t have dark spots, you’ll have little use for the dark spot oil serum. But the calendar has so much else to offer, it’s still a great buy.Number of products:27 (12 full size, 15 mini)Overall value:£385Packaging:domestically recyclableBlack Friday discountThe Next 25 days of beauty Advent calendar is reduced by £10.£85 at NextBest entry-level calendar:W7 Beauty Blast Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£19.95 at W7£16.95 at AmazonThis Advent calendar from W7 is staggeringly cheap compared with the others here. Inside, you’ll find 24 boxes, each filled with bestsellers from the W7 range, including seven full-size products and 19 minis.Why we love itGood beauty Advent calendars are generally pricey, but the products included in the W7 Advent calendar can rival some of the best in the business.All in, the product selection here is pretty useful for most people – I can’t see any makeup lovers struggling to include these in their routine. I particularly love the brand’s lip liners – you’ll get two in this calendar – and its H2O loose powder sets makeup without causing dryness. Also included is a mini Honolulu Sun Rays bronzer, famously similar to the Benefit Hoola bronzer. Another highlight is the Edgy mascara, which has a curved wand to help lift and curl the lashes as well as biotin, castor oil and vitamin B5 to condition the lashes.The travel-size eyeshadows, primers, lip balms, eye creams and liquid blushes are perfect if you’re just starting out with makeup and want to try new formulations and styles without remortgaging your home. For the cost, this calendar is perfect for those hoping to try out new, budget-friendly products.It’s a shame that …it’s mainly filled with travel minis, though this is perhaps expected given the price.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

But the brand’s annual Advent calendar is stocked full of 26 of its bestsellers, so you can try the range before adding something to your routine.Why we love itThe selection in this calendar is a skincare fanatic’s dream, with a full-size Pro-Collagen Future Restore Serum worth £115alone, and a Pro-Collagen Marine Cream worth £98. In these two products, the calendar almost pays for itself.The Pro-Collagen collection is widely regarded as one of the best anti-ageing skincare lines out there. Its marine algae complex helps smooth fine lines and improve skin’s firmness and elasticity to reduce the appearance of the signs of ageing caused by declining levels of collagen. Alongside the two full-size products, the calendar also contains 13 minis from the Pro-collagen range.These include various products from Elemis’s other lines, such as the Superfood Glow Priming moisturiser and Dynamic resurfacing facial wash. There are also a few body care products to use, such as a shower cream and a body balm. You could either use these yourself or sacrifice them to sticky-fingered members of your family to keep them away from the precious skincare.It’s a shame that …there are only two full-size products included. The rest are travel size, so while this is perfect for testing new products, it doesn’t feel like as much of a saving as other calendars. Many of the products are focused on anti-ageing, which makes them unsuitable for teenagers and young adults.Number of products:26 2 full size, 24 mini)Overall value:£698Packaging:domestically recyclableThe best of the restView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianAldi Lacura beauty Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£19.99 at Aldi (in store only)Best for:a small daily pick-me-upAldi is known for offering own-brand “dupes” of popular products at a dramatically lower price. There are more clever copycats inside the Lacura 12-day Advent calendar, even if they don’t quite rivalthe infamy of Cuthbert the Caterpillar.Most notably, you’ll get a 25ml Lacura honey-extract-infused hair oil, which is the spitting image of the Gisou honey hair oil. I’m a big fan of the name-brand product and was pretty impressed by the Lacura oil’s smell and texture – it would fool me if I didn’t know any better.For skincare, the calendar has a scalp and body sugar scrub. You may think this would be impossible to wash from your scalp, but the sugar base of the scrub dissolves in warm water, making it surprisingly easy. The calendar also features minis, including a rosy pink blush, highlighter and a tinted lip oil. Then, there’s a full-size black eyeliner and mascara. The moisturising primer and illuminating setting spray ensure makeup applies smoothly and stays put all day.For the price, it’s an easy way to treat yourself for the 12 days of Christmas. You’ll just have to fight your way into Aldi from 26 October to pick one up before they sell out.It didn’t make the final cut because …most of its products are minis, and it’s not as good value as the W7 calendar listed above. Furthermore, some of the doors are far less fun than others – I’d be less excited to receive a hair tie than a hair oil, for example. However, for the price, it’s hard to complain too much, as long as you can find one in store.Number of products:12;overall value:not stated;packaging:mainly card, with recyclable plastic insertsRituals Classic Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£82.40 at Lookfantastic£87.55 at SephoraBest for:body and hair careRituals is best known for its luxury scented body care, with a huge range of creams, scrubs, balms and oils. This calendar is designed to give you a taste of the best the brand has to offer. Inside, you’ll find 22 mini products, with a full-size hand balm and an exfoliating glove.I particularly recommend the body lotion mousse, which sunk in fast and gave a brilliant dose of hydration in my recentbody moisturisertests. If that’s too lightweight for you, I also recommend the Ritual of Jing whipped body cream. The two 50ml foaming shower gels are also fantastic to use, and the hydrating shampoo and conditioner are perfect for travel. Thankfully, the mousse, shower gels and hair care products are all at least 50ml, so there’s a reasonable amount of product to try.In the smaller minis, you’ll find a shimmery body oil, relaxing pillow spray and four votive-sized candles. There’s even a fabric softener in the bestselling Ritual of Sakura scent. That may sound strange, but I tried it in a recent load of laundry and was impressed by how well the scent stuck around. If you’re a fan of Rituals, you’ll be a fan of this.It didn’t make the final cut because …its overall value isn’t a huge amount more than the calendar costs, and most of the products are minis. Its packaging also includes a big plastic insert, which protects the products but isn’t great for the environment.Number of products:24 (2 full size, 22 mini);overall value:£164.50;packaging:domestically recyclable, with a plastic insertBlack Friday discountThe Rituals Classic Advent calendar is reduced by £20.60.£82.40 at LookfantasticSentier Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£99 at SentierBest for:fragrance loversThis 12-day calendar (designed for the 12 days of Christmas, so not strictly Advent) from Sentier comes with a range of perfumes and candles to see you through the festive season. It’s beautifully designed and surprisingly well priced considering how long-lasting and potent the scents are.Sentier describes the box it comes in as “meticulously crafted”. It’s certainly the most distinctive calendar of the lot, with doors and drawers opening in unexpected directions to reveal what’s inside.In the box, you’ll get six 10ml alcohol-free scents in pretty glass bottles. In my experience, each scent was distinct, wearable and versatile enough to layer, making them perfect for popping in a handbag. You’ll also get six scented candles, each 60ml in size. I found that these wafted scent around my flat beautifully.It didn’t make the final cut because …there’s a soft foam included in the bottom of each drawer, to keep the candle safe. This isn’t recyclable, despite the box being mainly made from card.Number of products:12;overall value:£516;packaging:not fully recyclableBamford ultimate Advent calendarView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The Guardian£300 at BamfordBest for:self-care and wellbeingIf you’re into baths and self-care rituals but have more refined taste (and a higher budget) than Lush, this celestial-themed Advent calendar from Bamford is a more indulgent option. It comes with a whole host of Bamford favourites, including 13 full-size products and 11 minis to help you wind down during the hectic festive period.In the full-size collection, you’ll find the brand’s bestselling perfume mist, two candles, body oil, bath oil and relaxing bath salts. In mini-size, you’ll find a range of body washes, lotions and hair care – less environmentally friendly perhaps, but handy to take on your travels over Christmas.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s very expensive. And its ratio of full-size to mini products could be better, considering the price.Number of products:24 (13 full size, 11 mini);overall value:about £600;packaging:domestically recyclableWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianAre beauty Advent calendars worth it?This depends. If your beauty routine is in need of a refresh and you want to try lots of new products, beauty Advent calendars allow you to do that for a reduced price.Case in point: the Boots Advent calendar listed above has 25 products with a total value of £612.50. It costs £127.50, so in theory it saves you £485.However, if you have a set beauty routine that works, then the mixed calendars might not be worth it. In this case, a scent-based or body-care Advent calendar may be more suitable as the products are less specific; a series of treats to enjoy rather than a whole new routine.How much should you expect to spend?Beauty Advent calendars can cost anything from £20 to £500 (or more), so there’s something to suit every budget. At the lower end of the scale, you can expect to find calendars from high-street brands, often with mini-size products inside. The packaging on these calendars is likely to be flimsier.Move up to the £100-£200 price range, and you can dip your toes into high-end brand calendars, or the department store Advent calendars, which contain a mix of bestselling products from a range of brands. The latter might work best if you’re buying a calendar as a gift, especially if you don’t know which brands the recipient likes best.At the top end of the scale, you’ll find beauty Advent calendars from exclusive high-end brands, usually containing mostly full-size products. Packaging for these calendars is typically more sculptural and eye-catching, but they also come with a high price tag of more than £200.Why are beauty Advent calendars released so early?Planning, organising and launching an Advent calendar takes a long time. Think about how many products are included in the major beauty retailers’ calendars. Then think about how much organisation it takes to coordinate with each brand on products to fit in each Advent calendar window. Add on to that marketing materials and imagery, and you’ve got a project that starts production almost as soon as the new year hits.Typically, brands release their calendars so early because it allows them to anticipate how much stock they need to order. As I’m writing this piece in August, many have already opened their waitlists, which helps them gauge how much interest there is in the calendar before it drops. When calendars go on sale in the autumn, it’s usually the case that when stock sells out, it’s gone for good.Sarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who can’t quite believe she gets to spend her days reviewing beauty products.

Even with some lighter furnishing removed, these robot vacuums had their work cut out.I used a smartphone sound meter to measure noise levels, and a plug-in power meter to see how much energy the docks or chargers used while idle and when charging. I also spilled flour and crunched cereal on to a barrier mat to check the suction and cleaning power of each model, treading in the crumbled shredded wheat to up the challenge. I used the apps to check the vacuums’ mapping and scheduling capabilities and to add rooms, zones and no-go areas.After testing, the cleaners were either returned to their sources or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best robot vacuums for 2025View image in fullscreen‘The absolute master of mopping’: the Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianBest robot vacuum cleaner overall:Eufy X10 Pro OmniEufyX10 Pro Omnifrom£499£699 at Eufy£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperb, hassle-free vacuuming and moppingWhat we don’t loveBig and noisy, especially when mop cleaningThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£699 at Eufy£499 at AmazonThe X10 Pro Omni is not a bad price for a self-emptying, self-cleaning robot mop and vacuum. The base station washes and dries the heads between uses, refilling the internal water tank and emptying the dust collector. It uses a front-facing camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors, spotting and identifying items, such as socks or cables, that it can then avoid. It’s powerful, with 8,000Pa of suction force, and its twin rotating mop heads can apply 1kg of downwards pressure, to give your hard floors a serious scrubbing when they need it.Why we love itThis Eufy machine does almost everything for you, as long as you periodically empty the base station’s dust bag and dirty-water tank and refill the clean-water tank. Like the Samsung, reviewed further down, it’s great at mapping out your home and dodging potential obstacles, but it’s also better than the Samsung at cleaning on the first pass. The side brush and vacuum can shift dust and hair in seconds, while the mop left my hard floors sparkling, even dealing with dried-on spots of juice.The Eufy X10 Pro Omni takes on the mess, before (left) and right (right).Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianThe app gives you plenty of control, allowing you to set up cleaning scenarios to focus on different areas. You can also tweak cleaning options such as suction power if, say, you’ve got a deep pile carpet to clean and you don’t think it’s really making an impact. The brush and roller seem particularly resistant to getting clogged with hair.It’s a shame that …mopping isn’t so effective on the low water setting – switching up to medium will get you better results. It’s also bigger and louder than rivals, struggling to fit under low furniture and hitting 68dB on max power. Cleaning and drying the mop can be a long and noisy process.Suction power:8,000PaRobotdimensions:327 x 353 x 114mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:365 x 480 x 360mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:3hrsPower consumption (charging):26.4WEufyX10 Pro Omnifrom£499£699 at Eufy£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperb, hassle-free vacuuming and moppingWhat we don’t loveBig and noisy, especially when mop cleaningBest robot vacuum for power cleaning:Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+SamsungBespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+from£1169.10£1299 at Samsung£1169.10 at AmazonWhat we loveBrilliant at navigation; strong and speedy cleaningWhat we don’t loveHuge base station; struggles with rugs£1,299 at Samsung£1,169.10 at AmazonIt’s hard to miss Samsung’s robot mop and vacuum cleaner, not least because its white base station is more of a mansion than a house, standing over half a metre tall. It’s also unnervingly speedy and has a habit of playing jingles when it starts or finishes, or on any event in between.It uses a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner and two 3D cameras to navigate your home, and it features twin rotating mop heads, which attach magnetically to the bottom of the unit. These are steam-cleaned and dried when the robot returns home.Why we love itIt’s a strong all-rounder. It doesn’t have as much suction as the mighty Dyson, reviewed below, but makes up for it by hunting hair, dust and debris relentlessly until it’s gone. The rotating mop heads do a fantastic job of removing marks and stains from kitchen floors, and they lift up when not in use to avoid rubbing on the carpet.Before (right) and after (left) the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ tackled flour and crunched up cereal on a mat.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianIt’s also great at navigation, picking up and even identifying potential obstacles, before carefully manoeuvring around them. Even my troublesome egg chair didn’t cause this machine any issues. With the dock’s integrated dust bin and water tanks, it’s also no great effort to maintain.It’s a shame that …the base station is enormous, and this model is among the most expensive on test. It also struggles with rugs more than the other top vacuums, regularly pulling up the edges and creating a rumpled mess that it subsequently had trouble traversing.Suction power:6,000PaRobotdimensions:359 x 364 x 100mm (WDH)Dockdimensions:444 x 510 x 547mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:3hrsPower consumption (charging):45.8WSamsungBespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+from£1169.10£1299 at Samsung£1169.10 at AmazonWhat we loveBrilliant at navigation; strong and speedy cleaningWhat we don’t loveHuge base station; struggles with rugsBest robot vacuum cleaner for small homes and small budgets:Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmartBekoVRR61414VB RoboSmartfrom£156.40£184 at Currys£156.40 at AmazonWhat we loveCheap, compact and effectiveWhat we don’t loveBefuddled by long hair; needs regular emptying£184 at Currys£156.40 at AmazonShort of space? Beko’s compact cleaner doesn’t need much: it’s just 34cm across and 8cm high, with a small, simple dock for charging. There’s no mop and not a huge amount of suction power, but it uses laser tech to map out and make its way around your rooms, automatically detecting rugs and carpets then boosting up the suction power. It’ll also get into nooks and under low furniture that halts bigger robot vacuums in their tracks.Why we love itIt’s relatively tiny and inexpensive, but don’t dismiss the Beko as a toy. Thanks to chunky wheels and ingenious suspension, it’ll make its way over tricky rugs and thresholds without any worries, and its rotating side brush has enough oomph to compensate for a meagre 2,000Pa of suction.While it’s not the best vacuum for deep cleaning, it’s great at heading out daily to keep dust under control. Battery life isn’t epic, but two hours should be more than enough for the two floors of the average home, and it can always head back to its dock and start again later. It’s also quiet, putting out 60-61dB even at maximum power.The mat before (left) and after (right) the Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart did its thing.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …long hair can bind itself around the side brush and roller, and it struggled to shift all the flour in the spot-cleaning test.

As well as the dust collector and tanks for clean and dirty water, it packs in three different sets of mop heads and reservoirs for three different detergents. The idea is that it can tell wooden floors from kitchen floors or bathroom floors and apply the right combo of mops and detergents for the job. Plus, when it encounters deep pile carpets, it can leave all the mops behind and focus on its vacuuming.Why we love itDreame’s robot vacuum is the absolute master of mopping. Parquet floors get the light touch; tiles and vinyl get a serious scrubbing; and every hard surface is left gleaming, without soggy rugs and puddles everywhere you look. It’s also a dab hand at vacuuming, with one brush on an articulated arm to sweep hair and debris from the edges of the room into the Dreame’s hungry rollers. There’s enough suction power here to deal with long hair or pet hair, even when it’s worked its way into your carpet.The before (left) and after demonstrate the Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra’s power in our tests.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianYou’ll need to keep the clean water tank topped up and the dirty tank emptied, but the Matrix 10 Ultra otherwise takes care of itself. It empties the internal dust box into a waiting bag when it returns to base for charging, where it will also clean and switch mop heads when it needs to. The heat treatment seems extremely effective at keeping everything grime- and odour-free.Dreame’s app is also extremely comprehensive, giving you plenty of control over its maps, so you can separate them into zones and apply different rules for cleaning. It’s also pretty nimble when it comes to rugs, thresholds and minor changes of elevation, though it still can’t handle proper steps.It’s a shame that …it’s better at navigating single-floor, open-plan spaces than multiple floors. You can move it to a different floor and set it to work, but it often needs to return to the base station for emptying or cleaning, and it can get confused and do nothing if it can’t locate its home. While it’s thorough, it also struggled to work its way around the low or awkward furniture in my living room.Suction power:30,000PaRobotdimensions:351 x 350 x 89mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:457 x 416 x 589mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:70dBABattery life:4hrs 20minsPower consumption (charging):38WDreameMatrix 10 Ultrafrom£999£999 at Very£999 at AmazonWhat we loveAwesome mopping, self-emptying and cleaningWhat we don’t lovePrefers open-plan layouts, hates awkward furnitureThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘One of the most compact base stations for charging and emptying we’ve seen’: the Eureka E20 Plus.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianDyson 360 Vis NavDyson360 Vis Navfrom£599£649.99 at Argos£599 at AmazonWhat we loveSuper-powered vacuuming; smart suction controlWhat we don’t loveExpensive and not thorough enough£649.99 at Argos£599 at AmazonBest for:powerDyson’s robot vac is the most powerful I’ve tested, dragging dirt and long hair out of carpet more effectively than any other model.

The app gives you plenty of control over areas and cleaning, with the ability to set up virtual walls or no-go zones. It’s also smart enough to do some ad hoc cleaning if you drop it in a room it hasn’t seen before.It didn’t make the final cut because…while we loved the bagless convenience – and it did almost make the cut – vacuuming was patchy in places, and its mopping capabilities are basic. Some of our floors got quite a soaking without shifting all the stains and marks. It’s great value and good for homes with moulting mogs and dogs, but not quite up there with our robot vacuum heroes.Suction power:8,000Pa;robotdimensions:350 x 350 x 97mm (WDH);dock dimensions:251 x 180 x 443mm (WDH);maximum noise level:83dBA;battery life:3hrs;power consumption (charging):55WEurekaE20 Plusfrom£371.13£499 at AO£371.13 at AmazonWhat we loveBagless dust collector; good for pet hairWhat we don’t lovePatchy vacuuming and soggy moppingWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenMost robot vacuums will easily make it around one floor of an average-sized home without a recharge.Photograph: diego_cervo/Getty ImagesRobot vacuums fit into two categories: those that just vacuum, and those that mop as well. My advice would be to focus on the vacuum part, and on the ability to suck up dirt and grime. The mopping is good enough to remove surface spills and superficial marks, but it won’t replace yoursteam cleaneror manual mop. What’s more, some of the less flexible mop mechanisms can leave you with a soggy carpet as the robot vacuum makes its way around your floor.Cleaning powerSuction power counts, and most manufacturers will specify the maximum suction force for each cleaner in Pascals (Pa) – or air watts (AW) in Dyson’s case. However, it’s not the whole story. Different cleaners will use different combinations of rollers and rotating brushes to whisk dirt and dust off the ground and into the vacuum intake.Some are also noticeably better than others at cleaning near the edges of a room and adjusting their suction power to match the levels of dust with which they have to deal. Most robot vacuums can do multiple passes if they need to, but this obviously adds to the cleaning time.Navigation and emptyingThe second key factor is navigation. Robot vacuums use a mix of optical and laser sensors and physical bumpers to make their way around the room, moving past obstacles and making sure they cover every area. More advanced models feature 3D cameras that map the room, giving them a clearer idea of the geography and their exact position within it. Either way, navigation skills vary dramatically, with some cleaners prone to getting lost or confused under your furniture.Vertical navigation skills are just as important, as robot vacuums will probably have to make their way over rugs and low-lying thresholds. Some of the more limber models can push, flip and clamber their way over impediments, while others just get tangled up.Robot vacuums don’t have much space onboard for their dust collector, so they need more regular emptying than the average cordless vacuum. The pricier models work around this by having a larger dust collector or bag in the base station or dock, so that when your robot vacuum puts itself to bed for a recharge, the dock will automatically empty the dust collector and, where necessary, clean the mop head and refill the water tank.Battery life and appsBattery life isn’t a huge deal with modern robot vacuums. Most will easily make it around one floor or more of an average-sized home without a recharge, and they automatically return to base if they’re caught short. However, a larger battery and a more efficient motor can be helpful if you have a bigger space to keep in shape.Onboard controls can be useful when you just want to clean an area quickly, but you’ll spend most of your time managing your robot vacuum from a smartphone app. At the very least, these should have features to customise any room maps, adding zones that need more thorough cleaning and no-go areas where you don’t want the robot vacuum to get stuck.Scheduling features are also very welcome, allowing you to set times when you want your plucky robot to put itself to work. And accessible controls, to change the settings or run quieter at night, can make your new friend even easier to live with.Can robot vacuums clean multiple rooms at a time?They can, though the way this works can vary from model to model. Most robot vacuums navigate and map a whole floor at a time. Once that’s done, you can use the app to label different rooms and then send your robot to a given location.Many let you map multiple floors, and you don’t usually need to move the charging station between floors – just carry the unit upstairs or downstairs. If you have any steps between rooms (like I do in my living room), this often needs to be mapped as a separate floor.Even where mapping isn’t supported, you can usually work around it by carrying the robot vacuum into the other space and setting it to clean. It may not clean as efficiently or effectively, but it will navigate the space and get the job done.How do robot vacuums compare to regular vacuum cleaners?As with cordless vacuums, robot vacuums come with a trade-off between size, battery life and suction force. Because they have to trundle around under their own steam for long enough to cover a decent-sized area, this inevitably limits the power of the vacuum motor.Even powerful robot vacuums top out at 65AW (or 6,000 to 8,000Pa), and that’s often in their battery-draining turbo modes. By comparison, some cordless cleaners offer suction levels up to 250AW, and mains-powered vacuums can go even higher.Confusingly, most manufacturers don’t offer the same suction power across their whole range. Irrespective of which model you buy, though, you may still need a manual vacuum cleaner to purge your carpets of pet hair and really stubborn grime.Stuart Andrews is ajournalistwithmore than three decades of experience in computing and consumer tech.

Illustration: Jamie WignallIllustration: Jamie Wignall/The GuardianMoney hacksConsumer affairsCoupling up: how to avoid money worries in your relationshipFrom joint bank accounts and pooled savings to mortgages and tax allowances, talk about money for a happy financial future togetherRupert JonesWed 26 Nov 2025 02.00 ESTShareStart – and keep – talkingThere’s no one-size-fits-all answer for whether you should manage your finances jointly, separately or somewhere in the middle.The most important thing is to have conversations about money – things such as spending, budgeting, debt and saving – early on in your relationship to prevent misunderstandings and arguments later.According to the counselling serviceRelate, worries around finance are the biggest strain on couples across the UK, yet, it says, surveys have shown that “a large proportion of us feel unable to actually talk about money with our partners”.If you are struggling to get a conversation going, you could draw up a written plan. You could suggest you each separately write down how you think you should manage your finances as a couple, and then talk about it. You may have to compromise on some things.Any arrangements you make should be reviewed every now and again, particularly if one person’s circumstances change – for example, if they get a pay rise.Think about billsMoving in together is a big deal and will mean sorting out who’s going to pay for what.The good news is that some bills should come down. If you were each paying for Netflix, Amazon Prime or other subscriptions, in many cases you will be able to halve those costs. Other costs can be cut, too – for example, some gym chains, such as David Lloyd, offer a discount if you sign up as a couple.Use smart tech, turn heat down, service boilers: how to save money on energy billsRead moreWhen it comes to gas, electricity and other utility bills, you could split these 50:50 or proportionally based on each person’s income.Some utility companies will let couples put both people’s names on the bills. This can mean that both people, as opposed to just one, are liable for any unpaid bills and debts.Consider teaming up …One big decision is whether to have a joint current account. Relate says setting one up “is an act of serious trust”.“Having a joint account means your partner has the right to spend whatever’s in it, no questions asked,” says Andy Webb, ofBe Clever With Your Cash. “If your partner goes on a spree and the account ends up overdrawn, you’ll both be responsible for clearing the debt.”You should think very carefully if your partner has debts or a bad credit score, as joint account holders’ credit files are financially linked. When you apply for credit, the lender could choose to view the credit file of the person you are linked to, as well as yours, and this could affect your ability to borrow.If you set up a joint account you need to decide what it is for. You could opt to combine all your income in one place and have all spending – from big bills to small things like takeaway coffees – come out of that account.“You’ll both have control over the money, and you’ll both be able to see what the other person is spending,” says the government-backedMoneyHelperwebsite.Meanwhile, you can’t get a joint credit card, but you can often request a supplementary card for a partner. The “primary” cardholder will be responsible for any spending by the supplementary cardholder, so bear this in mind before you apply.View image in fullscreenHave conversations about money early in your relationship to discuss things such as household bills, budgeting and saving.Photograph: OJO Images Ltd/Alamy…or a halfway houseAnother option is to open a joint current account for things such as household bills and emergencies, but for each partner to have their own bank account for personal spending.Think about how much each partner will pay into the joint account each month. It could be an equal contribution or related to each person’s income.Webb says having only a joint current account, without individual accounts, can be risky. “You might not feel the need to have separate funds – but relationships can go wrong, from breakups to financial abuse, so it makes sense to have access to your own money should you need it,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘A large proportion of us feel unable to actually talk about money with our partners,’ says Relate.Photograph: Hinterhaus Productions/Getty ImagesPool savingsThe digital bank Revolut recently launched a range of joint savings accounts so couples can “save side by side” and earn up to 4.5% interest.This may suit those saving towards a shared goal such as a big holiday.Webb says that while a joint savings account will not affect your credit report, “you still need to be confident that the other person isn’t going to empty the account without your permission”.A couple who open a joint account currently get up to £170,000 of their cash protected – double the standard £85,000-a-person protection under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). The latter figure will rise to £120,000 from 1 December, so for a couple, the protection will be up to £240,000.Any interest earned will typically be split 50:50 for income tax purposes.Max your mortgage borrowingHigh house prices mean many couples have little choice but to apply for a mortgage jointly in order to maximise their borrowing power.As a rough rule of thumb, HSBC would let someone earning £50,000 a year borrow up to £275,000 to buy their first home. But if they applied jointly with a partner who earned £40,000 a year, they could borrow up to £495,000.The lender will look at both credit records when assessing affordability.View image in fullscreenApplying for a mortgage together can maximise your borrowing power.Photograph: Morsa Images/Getty ImagesGet cheaper car insuranceAdding your partner to your car insurance policy can result in you paying a lot less. Insurers see those who are in a couple as lower risk than people who are single.Earlier this year,data from the price comparison site Confused.comshowed the average annual cost of car insurance for a woman who was the only driver on a policy was £809. When one additional named driver who was not their spouse was added, the cost was £704, when a spouse was added it went down to £544 on average. It was the same story for men, although the premiums were different.It’s not just car cover: joint life insurance is usually cheaper than two separate individual policies. Insurers say this is because statistics suggest married and cohabiting couples generally live longer than single people.Grab the couples’ tax perkThemarriage allowanceis a tax break for couples where one earns less than the personal allowance: normally £12,570 a year. To benefit, you have to be married or in a civil partnership.The lower earner can transfer up to £1,260 of their personal allowance to their husband, wife or civil partner who is earning more than £12,570 a year. It applies if the higher earner is a basic-rate taxpayer, except in Scotland, where they must pay the starter, basic or intermediate rate.

If you are not married and you breach the inheritance tax threshold – £325,000 for an individual, or £500,000 if you leave your home to your children or grandchildren – there could be tax to pay.Also, any unused threshold can be added to the surviving spouse or civil partner’s threshold when the first person dies.You can pass a home to your husband, wife or civil partner when you die. There’s no inheritance tax to pay if you do this.Meanwhile, most pensions will pay out to a spouse when the first person dies. If you are not married, fill in a “nomination of beneficiaries” form to ask for anything to pass to your partner. Your pension provider will be able to send you a form or will have one you can download.Explore more on these topicsConsumer affairsMoney hacksSaving moneyHousehold billsMortgagesRelationshipsBanks and building societiesSavingsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was the start of a new relationship with nature, and a reminder of my childhood joie de vivreMel BradmanWed 26 Nov 2025 01.55 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 08.03 ESTShareAs hookup sites go, it was in another league. I was looking for a different kind of soulmate and I was spoilt for choice. Would it be Floyd, “a stylish poser and a winner of hearts”? Or Bobby, “who loves cuddling and is a bit of a showoff”? Or could it be the “beautiful and incredibly sweet Morris with a gentle nature”? One stood out. Not only was he “very affectionate” but he was also “a bit of a troublemaker – always exploring and often found sitting on the rocks”. Just what I was looking for; I swiped right. That’s how I met Jarrah. My koala.A month before, in 2020, I’d seen a newsflash about the bushfires in Australia. The effect on the continent’s wildlife was devastating. An estimated61,000 koalas had been killed or injuredamong 143 million other native mammals. There were two things I felt I could do from the UK: one was to make koala mittens to protect their burnt paws (following a pattern I found online); and two, I could adopt a koala and send monthly donations to protect them in the wild. So I joined the Australian Koala Foundation, which is dedicated to the marsupials’ survival.I was sent an adoption certificate featuring Jarrah, which I stuck on my kitchen wall. For the next two years, I followed his progress – he was one of a handful of koalas kept in a wildlife sanctuary near Perth. In January 2023, during a trip to Western Australia, I finally met him. The park rangers, who told me I was one of the few “koala mums” to have visited, seemed excited to see me. Jarrah not so much. My first view of him was asleep on his perch – not surprising, as koalas are flat out for up to 21 hours a day. He was a lot bigger than I’d expected; definitely not soft-toy size, but quite bear-like.Koala “experiences” – a meet and greet – are strictly regulated, as the animals get easily stressed. Even so, I didn’t quite get the welcome I’d been hoping for. After Jarrah was lifted from his perch, still half-asleep, he bit me. It was a reminder that although koalas look cute, they are wild animals and not pets (these are symbolic adoptions). But it was just a small nip, and a minute later all was forgotten when Jarrah allowed me to stroke him. I was told I could pat him gently, though not on the top of his head. He particularly liked being rubbed between his shoulders. I followed him when he crawled around on all four paws in a surprisingly nimble fashion. I also witnessed some playground politics when another koala, Kai, who was put out that Jarrah was getting all the attention, tried to shove him off his perch.View image in fullscreen‘Very affectionate’ but also ‘a bit of a troublemaker’: Jarrah.Photograph: Courtesy of Mel BradmanIt was at this moment, while I was standing between the two of them, that I remembered something I had forgotten had existed. As a child, I was besotted with koalas after being given a cuddly version on my fifth birthday. I preferred it to any of my other toys (and there was some tough competition). I remember thinking then what a great adventure it would be to be stuck up a tree with him. Now, when I think of Jarrah, I am instantly connected to my first “happy place” – cynicism and discontent go out the window. It doesn’t quite send me dancing into the sunset, but it reminds me how a bit of childhood joie de vivre can put a spring in your step, even as an adult.During my time with Jarrah (named after a native tree), I learned a lot about these extraordinary two-thumbed creatures, which are believed to have evolved more than 25m years ago. “Koala” is an aboriginal word for “no water” – they get just about all the moisture they need from eucalyptus leaves. And the reason they sleep so much? Because it takes all their energy to digest and detoxify the leaves. Plus, they are fussy eaters and can only eat a few of the hundred species of eucalyptus that grow in Australia, so their habitats are very limited.I found out how vulnerable koalas are; not just from climate crisis and disease, but from the excessive land clearing and development that bulldozes their trees, leaving them homeless. Despite being made a protected species in 1937, after millions were shot for the fur trade, there is still no law to protect their habitat and they are now listed as endangered.View image in fullscreenKai (left) tries to shove Jarrah off his perch.Photograph: Courtesy of Mel BradmanI have always cared about animal welfare, but the time I spent with Jarrah took it to the next level. Of course, koalas aren’t the only endangered species, and though I can’t help them all, I wanted to do more. So I signed up to other animal charities and volunteered in their shops, clocking up 80 miles for an RSPCA-sponsored run, and extending my menagerie by adopting more creatures – some exotic, others closer to home. I now have a gorilla, a donkey, farm animals, a pangolin, two guide dogs and another koala (Colt, in Queensland – “an endearing little sweetheart, gifted at enjoying the simple pleasures of life”). If friends want cat-sitting, dog-walking or need a pet taken to the vet, I’m there on speed-dial.Even though it was a fleeting encounter, and Jarrah never wrote, never called and remained enigmatic, I have much to thank him for. He opened my eyes, not only to something important I’d forgotten about myself, but to a much bigger picture.Explore more on these topicsWildlifeA moment that changed meDeforestationTrees and forestsConservationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Originally introduced by Danish immigrants in the late 19th century, they’re essentially a big ring of flaky Viennese pastry filled with fruit or nuts, then iced and served in little slices. Even bad kringles are pretty delicious, and when out-of-towners try them for the first time, their reaction is usually: ”Where has this been all my life?”We eat kringles year-round, but I mainly associate them with fall, perhaps because of their common autumnal fillings such as apple or cranberry, or perhaps because of the sense ofhyggethey provide. I also associate kringles with Thanksgiving – and with uncles. And I don’t think it’s just me; Racine’s biggest kringle baker,O&H Danish Bakery, operates a cafe/shop called “Danish Uncle”. But I also think of Thanksgiving as the most uncle-y American holiday, geared towards watching football and snoozing on the couch.On Thanksgiving, you get together with your uncles (who all have strong, reliable uncle names such as Steve, Bob and Mike), and you talk about kringles, because you can’t talk about feelings or politics. Kringles are naturally convivial and conversational; Racinians will never eat kringle without debating the merits of various local bakeries (for the record: I’m aBendtsen’sman until I die). Maybe the conversation never gets that deep with your uncles; maybe you can’t tell them that you love them, or even give them a hug that isn’t unnatural and awkward. But that’s OK, you can give them kringle instead.Cherry marzipan kringleServes8-10220g lukewarm milk25g caster sugar7g sachet dried yeast1 tsp salt200g strong white bread flour160g plain flour40g plain wholemeal flour200g cold unsalted butter230g marzipan100g sour cherry jam or compoteBeaten egg,to glazeIcing sugarIn a large bowl, combine the lukewarm milk, caster sugar, dried yeast, and a teaspoon of salt, then whisk to dissolve the ingredients into the milk.In a second bowl, mix the flours. Tip the flours into the milk mix, then stir with a spatula until everything comes together into a dough. Knead in the bowl until the dough has an even texture, without any dry or sticky patches, then cover loosely and leave to prove for one hour.Make a butter block by cutting the cold butter into 12 slices, then tiling them into a rectangle along a length of baking paper, two by six slices of butter across. Fold the paper over the top of the butter like an envelope, then use a rolling pin to flatten the butter and press the edges of each slice together, to make a thin, solid block about 14cm x 32cm. Keep the butter wrapped in the paper, and transfer to the fridge.Roll the risen dough into a large roughly 16cm x 70cm rectangle. Peel the paper off the butter block, then putthebutter block in the centre of the dough. Fold the sides of the pastry up over the top and press down on the edges to enclose the butter. Fold the dough in by thirds (like you would a letter) to make three layers of butter, then put in a container and chill for 30 minutes.Rotate the dough into a landscape position, then roll it into a 30cm x 20cm rectangle. Fold into thirds again, then return to the fridge for another 30 minutes. Repeat this process once more, chilling again for 30 minutes.Cut the marzipan into thin slices about 2mm thick. Cut the dough lengthways into two long rectangles, then roll each piece to 16cm x 70cm. Spoon the cherry jam or compote in a line down the centre of the dough, then lay half of the marzipan in a single layer on top of the jam. Fold the far edge of dough towards you and over the filling, and then fold the near edge of dough over the top of that, and pinch to seal. Curl the line of dough round to make a ring, tucking one end into the other. Repeat the process to make a second kringle.Carefully transfer the rings to two trays lined with baking paper, brush the surface of each with beaten egg, then bake at 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ for 22 minutes, until well browned. Leave to cool, then flatten each kringle by laying another tray on to the surface and pressing down firmly. Drizzle with thick icing made with icing sugar and water, and leave to set before slicing and serving.Tim Anderson is the author of the 24 Hour Pancake People newsletter and Hokkaido: Recipes from the Seas, Fields and Farmlands of Northern Japan, published by Hardie Grant at £28.

Especially when you finish roasting them in a glaze made with butter (or, even better, saved chicken, pork, beef or goose fat) and the last scrapings from aMarmitejar.Marmite roast potatoesI’ve always been fanatical about Marmite, so much so that I refuse to waste a single scoop. I used to wrestle with a butter knife, scraping endlessly at the jar’s sticky bottom, until I learned that there’s a reason the rounded pot has a small flat spot on each side. When you get close to the end of the jar, store the pot on its side, so the last of that black gold inside pools neatly into the side for easy removal. Those stubborn dregs work brilliantly in this recipe, and transform your roast spuds into the most flavour-packed ones you’ll ever eat. But go easy: Marmite is potent stuff, and even the last few scrapings will go a long way.Serves44 tbsp olive oil800g potatoesAbout 2 tbsp Marmite– top up the last scrapings of a jar as required25g butter, or saved meat fat (chicken, pork, beef or goose fat)Sea salt, to tasteChives, finely chopped, to finishSouredcream(optional)Put the oil into a roasting tray, then put it in a 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ oven to heat up. Cut the potatoes into 5cm-7½cm chunks, leaving them unpeeled. Put the spuds in a large pan, cover with cold water, add a good pinch of sea salt and bring to a boil, covered, ideally, to save energy. Simmer for about eight minutes, until fork-tender, then drain and leave to steam in the colander for a few minutes.Toss the potatoes to rough up their edges, then carefully tip into the hot oil and toss again to coat. Squash each potato slightly with the back of a spoon, but only just enough so they split open, then return the tray to the oven and roast for about 45 minutes, until the potatoes turn golden and start to crisp up.Meanwhile, stand a nearly empty Marmite jar in a saucepan filled with a little hot water and simmer gently to loosen the contents of the jar (you’ll need about two tablespoons in total, so top up if need be). Add the butter (or saved fat) to the jar, leave to melt, then scrape down the insides of the jar and stir to combine the Marmite with the butter or fat.Once completely melted and loose, drizzle the Marmite glaze all over the potatoes, toss gently, then return to the oven for a final 10-15 minutes, until deeply crisp and caramelised. Finish with optional finely chopped chives and serve with soured cream, if you like.Explore more on these topicsPotatoesWaste notFoodFood wasteSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the second day of a wintry weekend in Croyde, north-west Devon; I’m stiff from an hour in the sea the previous afternoon, and the upper part of the super-thick wetsuit won’t budge past my elbows. Together, my husband, Mark, and I jiggle and pull and yank it over my limbs. Finally, five minutes later, I am in a silver-blue sea, entirely empty, save for us. White-crested waves roll in, broiling and foaming, rocketing us forward towards the empty swathe of sand. For once there are no other boarders to dodge, no surfers whisking past: it’s exhilarating, extraordinary and … really rather cold.Map of north-west DevonCroyde has long been a family favourite, but visiting in November does feel a bit of a gamble. It has a reputation as something of a ghost town in the off-season, with a large number of second homes and rentals that stay dark from October to April. But when an unexpected email landed from Endless Summer Beach House offering a 20% discount on winter stays, it seemed the ideal 30th birthday treat for my nephew, Ben. So, together with his girlfriend, Tasha, best mate, Rob, and my sister Caroline, we decided to take the plunge and find out what off-season Croyde is actually like.When Mark and I arrive, the sky is unexpectedly blue, and we pull on our wetsuits and head straight for the sea. One of the joys of Croyde is that it doesn’t really change: the dunes that separate the beach from the village are strictly protected, saving both from the development that has scarred nearby resorts such as Westward Ho! and Woolacombe. Instead, the fields that flank the dunes are alive with rabbits grazing quietly, scampering away in white-tailed flashes as we pass.View image in fullscreenAnnabelle and her husband, Mark, on Croyde beach.Photograph: Annabelle ThorpeAt first, it feels strange to find the beach so deserted, but seeing it free of windbreaks, ballgames and pop-up tents renders its raw, natural beauty even more dramatic. It’s no wonder the place gets overrun in the summer months, when the sea froths with hundreds of bodyboarders and surfers, red and yellow lifeguard flags billowing in the breeze. Today there is nothing but sky and sea: a jagged patch of blue above the long curve of Hartland Point, a curtain of misty rain slowly dissipating Lundy island into the flint-grey wash of the ocean.The people we pass are smiley and friendly – a shared delight at having Croyde’s gorgeous dunes and coastline pretty much to ourselvesLater, when I nip into the village to pick up some bread, the narrow main street is almost as deserted as the beach. TheSaltrocksurfwear shop is open, as isThe Hub, beloved by Ben for its lemon crunch ice-cream (and all of us for the pasties). The Post Office shows distinct signs of life, as doesThe Thatchpub, but otherwise most places are closed until spring. As I stroll back, I think about how it takes 15 minutes to queue for an ice-cream in summer, with the Post Office out of anything fresh by about 9.30am.View image in fullscreenWalking on Baggy Point, from left: Rob, Mark, Annabelle, Caroline, Tasha and Ben.Photograph: Annabelle ThorpeNot everything is shrouded in silence. When we head to The Thatch for dinner on Friday night, the place is packed and buzzy (I had feared it might just be us), although I suspect almost everyone else is local. As ever, the food is fantastic: crisp salt and pepper squid and a Balinese seafood curry, tangy with lemongrass and galangal, served with a heap of coconut sambal that adds up to the best dish I’ve eaten out all year. The boys find room for banoffee pie and apple tart.There are plenty of other signs of life, too. On Saturday, we head to Braunton (15 minutes’ drive) for the annual firework display, heading down pretty lanes we didn’t even know existed – we never usually get much further than the car park and the Co-op. It’s lovely to get a sense of the place as itreallyis, with all the flummery and frenetic pace of summer stripped away. On the walk to the beach, the few people we pass are smiley and friendly – a shared delight at having Croyde’s gorgeous dunes and coastline pretty much to ourselves.Coming away out of season has other benefits too: we don’t expect good weather, so a sunny Saturday is an absolute boon. When it rains all day Sunday, we pull on wet weather gear and stride out aroundBaggy Point, where the sea – now a palette of steel, platinum and foaming white – is just as spectacular as under blue skies. Once it’s dark, we play board-games, watch old films, eat hearty curries and bolognese – with no squabbling over why the barbecue won’t light and whether the sausages are cooked through.View image in fullscreenThe Thatch pub.Photograph: Richard Naude/AlamyThe problem with tagging places such as Croyde as “ghost towns” in the off-season is that it deters people from visiting – the very thing our seaside resorts need most. The village was quiet, but far from dead – and, frankly, if you go with a group, you make your own atmosphere anyway. By the time we were packing the cars on Monday lunchtime (another off-season bonus is that accommodation owners are often more flexible about arrival and departure times), we were already talking about booking a return visit next November. Some might call Croyde a ghost town, but it had all the spirit we needed for an early winter break.Endless Summer Beach House, sleeps 10, from£920 for a three-night break.

Bar stools are a bonafide torture deviceReadmore petty gripesEleanor BurnardWed 26 Nov 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 16.59 ESTShareBeing short comes with sizeable challenges. My view at concerts is almost always blocked. I own more pinchy heels than comfy flats. Finding jeans that fit properly is a headache. But most importantly: bar stools. They are inescapable.I was reminded of this deep-seated hatred during this year’s Melbourne fashion week. I arrived unfashionably late and had to sit behind the front row – which didn’t upset me, I was truly happy to just be there! But what did annoy me was the only chair choice available: a bar stool that came up to my waist.I was wearing platforms and a short dress, leaving me with two equally humiliating outcomes. I could either flash my undies to those behind me, or twist my ankle attempting to leap on to the seat. Unsatisfied with either option, I ended up leaning against it and hoped that I came across as nonchalant and cool rather than pathetic.So now I say, on behalf of all short people everywhere: enough is enough!My petty gripe: my toddler’s a night owl. Where are all the 5pm kids’ activities?Read moreMust I be forced to dangle my feet off the ground like some child, all because I wanted to sit down and drink a chai latte? Have we not suffered enough, what with those condescending monikers like “fun-sized” we’ve been dealing with for years?I learned pretty quickly that the world isn’t built with us shorties in mind. Not when you’re a Shetland pony in a paddock made for thoroughbreds. But aren’t bar stools a scourge on us all in society, regardless of height?Because throw a lack of back support into the mix and you’ve got a bona fide torture device, specialising entirely in humiliation and pain. They force us to contort our spines until we resemble that of an overcooked prawn; hunched over and completely undignified.I don’t understand why we, as a collective species, have not rid ourselves of this agonising apparatus. Who the hell wants this? I want to sit down at a table when I eat. I shouldn’t have to do a high jump or flow through a yoga sequence to scoff down an overpriced burger.After all, stool is just another word for shit. And I don’t care if I’m being petty; it’s simply impossible for me to be the bigger person.Explore more on these topicsLife and stylePetty gripesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Guardian readers share their experiences on why they left – or are thinking of moving out of New Zealand.I found a job in Australia in a weekI was searching for employment for seven months back home. I have experience in my field, and was only getting bites here and there from hiring panels who were genuinely more overwhelmed than I was.

But as vivid as those memories are, you can’t build a life on scenery alone.AdamNew Zealand not the utopian idealWe are considering leaving for financial reasons and a failing healthcare system. It’s not the utopian ideal that The Hobbit and AirNew Zealandsells to the rest of the world. Fifteen to 20 years ago it offered opportunity – a relaxed and balanced work/life (compared to the UK) – now it’s caught up and overtaken the UK in terms of failing social welfare, healthcare and a lack of infrastructure investment. Young people have no future here and only the wealthy … can afford to stay.AntI wish I could have achieved this in New ZealandI’ve already left for higher level study and now work. I have a stable and well-paying job and stable housing, transport, food costs and other amenities. I could not attain this in New Zealand, nor would I be as successful in my career as I am now. [I feel] very sad. I wish I could have achieved this in New Zealand.CelineThe scientific landscape feels uncertainI’m considering leaving – I think it’s quite likely that I’ll leave next year. Between the changes in government research funding, the ongoing amalgamation of the crown research institutes, and the current government’s apathy towards environmental restoration and climate action, the scientific landscape in New Zealand feels a bit uncertain at the moment. I’m worried about my prospects of finding a well-funded research position here and concerned about the cost of living.I love Aotearoa. I would miss my family and friends, the landscapes, and the sound of tui waking me up in the morning. Ultimately, though, I think a move overseas would be the best option for me, both in terms of career progression and my own personal growth.AnonymousView image in fullscreenMilford Sound, New Zealand.Photograph: mariusz_prusaczyk/Getty Images/iStockphotoIt doesn’t feel like home[I’m] considering leaving, no hope for buying a house for the family, the cost of living is very high and housing prices are still insane, even after a slight drop. Too difficult to compete with all the investors who speculate with family homes.Moving is always difficult. But hope for the future is worth it. We are looking for rational house-to-income ratios. [It’s] sad, but the country has changed so much that it doesn’t feel like home.AnonymousI got a 30% pay rise in Australia[I] left NZ two years ago for significantly cheaper IVF treatment – about one-fifth of NZ – and significantly higher teacher salaries. I got a 30% pay rise by moving [to Australia].A bit sad, but ultimately there aren’t enough good reasons to go back compared to what we’ve got here. The countries just seem to be going in opposite directions.AnonymousNew Zealand gets too much grief nowI am in the process of leaving for a graduate position in Australia next year. Even without the graduate position, I was already planning my move. I was actually volunteering overseas in 2024, and came back to NZ in early 2025. There were simply just no jobs that would take me. I have a master’s degree, experience with the UN, and found it difficult to even get a part-time job. In Australia, the opportunities are infinite compared to NZ. I can also at least attempt to begin saving for retirement with the superannuation scheme, and even owning some type of property seems more within reach.Ancient preserved heads give up their secrets as Māori tattoos see resurgenceRead more[I feel] quite sad. I don’t have any friends in the city I’ll be moving to, and most of my friends from NZ I have known since childhood. My parents moved to NZ when I was young, hoping to raise us in a nice, safe country. It still is honestly, and I think NZ is getting too much grief right now. I obtained NZ citizenship, as well as others in my family, in the hopes of really making roots here. So leaving feels like another punch in the gut, in that I feel as though I’m abandoning the country that raised me.IanBuying a house feels impossibleI was previously trained in software development, however, AI destroyed most entry-level jobs and was further exacerbated with the downturn in the economy, so I decided to pivot and train again as a school teacher. I’m considering leaving New Zealand primarily because of wages. It’s well understood one can make a third more in income generally. I know that after my teaching training I could get a lot more over there in income, which is a shame because I would love to stay in New Zealand, however, getting ahead, wanting a family and especially getting on the housing ladder feels near impossible here.I feel sad. I love my country. I don’t want to leave. I hope that things will change and will become easier for young people to get ahead, otherwise New Zealand will sink to an island of the haves and have-nots.AnonymousView image in fullscreenAuckland, New Zealand. Many readers told the Guardian they were leaving NZ for economic reasons.Photograph: Chameleons Eye/REX/ShutterstockThe mood here is bleakMy partner and I have decided to move to Germany next June. Mostly, we just want an adventure; the “big OE” is pretty ingrained in the Kiwi cultural psyche and is basically a rite of passage for a lot of young people – although lately the vibe has definitely shifted where more people are leaving the country out of necessity, not choice. I love Aotearoa, but it’s a very physically isolating place to be from, and I want to experience life in a bigger, more well-connected place (the concept of a country with land borders is mind-bogglingly cool). New Zealand currently feels like it’s at a dead end; our heartless government has gutted our public sector, welfare system, indigenous rights and more, the cost of living is so expensive, and there just aren’t a lot of opportunities in general. While I’m pretty optimistic we’ll have a change of government at next year’s election, our problems won’t be solved overnight, and the overall mood here is a bleak one. I’m not being driven out of the country, but there’s also nothing keeping me here, either.I’m excited to leave; I’ve always wanted to live overseas … The world at large is in a precarious place, and Germany has its own set of problems; but I don’t think I’m any better off staying where I am.This government is failing us, and leaving feels like my own personal “fuck you”. The fact that there’s thousands of others just like me is enough of a statement itself.AnonymousExplore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificPopulationSocial trendsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The sea wall was removed in 2015 to make water flow on to the island for the first time in 400 years.The charity then constructed islands, some of them from the Elizabeth line soil, and created lagoons and salt marshes. The wetland area now protects residents against flooding by absorbing storm waters.Wallasea was once bereft of birds but now its visitors include 800 avocets, more than 10,000 knot waders, nearly 3,000 grey plovers and a similar number of bar-tailed godwits. It has reached a record of 39,000 birds overwintering on the site.Rachael Fancy, the site manager, said: “When I first started working at Wallasea it looked an awful lot like a construction site – because that’s what it was. But just 10 years on, there’s no evidence of the diggers or trucks. There’s just thousands and thousands of birds who now use it as a refuge, shelter and nursery for their chicks. It’s an almost unbelievable transformation.”Project managers said successful use of soil from the Elizabeth line showed that construction and nature restoration could go hand in hand.Milo Sumner, coastal programmes manager at RSPB England, said: “Wallasea shows what’s possible when business has an ethos of working with, and alongside, nature. The creation of the Elizabeth line was one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in decades, and by collaborating we were able to create a win for nature and people from what would otherwise have been a huge pile of wasted soil.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I liked the idea of driving for a living, but not the solitude. Driving a bus seemed perfect: you have a certain level of autonomy, without a boss breathing down your neck.You have to have the right kind of personality to excel at bus driving. You need to be a very good driver, but you need to be able to command order at the same time.I like that I can influence how my day goes; I’m in charge of the atmosphere on my bus. Some drivers are very strict, but I think that makes for a miserable day, so I try to spread a bit of happiness. If I see someone running for the bus as I’m about to pull away, I’ll always stop and wait – even though sometimes they run straight past me.One elderly chap gets on my bus every week, and he always slips me a KitKat without saying a word. It feels a bit like a surreptitious drug deal, but it’s very much appreciated.I’ve wanted to win bus driver of the year for years, but it’s highly competitive. You need to have an exemplary record, good feedback from customers, no prangs on the bus and excellent timekeeping. About 100 drivers from across the country make the grand final in Blackpool. There’s a theory test and practical exam, where you’re asked to park a bus exactly one metre from the pavement and line up a lamp-post to the middle of the hubcap. It’s very tense, but luckily, I managed to be very accurate.To be told I’d won really was a dream come true. I take a lot of pride in my job, so it’s nice to be recognised.I was excited to learn I’d won £4,100 prize money, too. I celebrated with a cup of tea with my wife.‘I get immense satisfaction from seeing the toilets clean and sparkling’View image in fullscreen‘I’ve seen some sights’ … Margaret Rutter, who works as a washroom attendant at Annandale Distillery, Annan, Scotland.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianMargaret Rutter,73, fromAnnandale,Dumfries and Galloway, was namedwashroomtechnician of theyearfor Scotlandat theLoo of theYear awardsI’ve always enjoyed being a cleaner. I’m a clean and tidy person and I get immense satisfaction from seeing the toilets clean and sparkling. Some people probably think mine is not a very important job – I’m “only” the toilet cleaner – but the way I see it, everyone needs to go to the toilet, and everyone wants the facilities to be a pleasure to visit.I work six days a week, starting at 6.30am, and clean for three hours. I like to get down on my hands and knees and really give the whole bowl a scrub, including the pipes and behind the U-bend.I look after all seven toilets at the Annandale distillery. They are for staff and visitors, so they get quite a lot of heavy usage.There’s no need to go over the top, though; I don’t fold the toilet paper into a point and try to show off. A good toilet cleaner knows that cleanliness and hygiene are what’s important, not trying to impress people. There’s no point doing origami with the toilet roll if the soap dispensers are empty or the seat is rife with germs.I’m 73, but I don’t have plans to retire – there are a lot more toilets for me to cleanI got my first toilet cleaning job in 1999, and I’ve probably cleaned somewhere in the region of 150,000 toilets. In that time, I’ve seen some sights. It’s shocking how some people feel it’s acceptable to leave a toilet cubicle. But I just roll up my sleeves, put on my gloves and get on with it. I sometimes have to try hard not to think too much about what I’m actually cleaning.I’m quite critical when using public toilets myself. I won’t use them if they’re not clean, and even if they are, I find myself checking how much spare loo roll is available.When I get home, the last thing I usually want to do is clean my own toilet. I do, though, of course.Winning the award was such a special moment for me. The judges make an anonymous visit to the toilets, and I’m glad I didn’t know they were coming, as I’d have been too nervous.I was thrilled to have won, and my son and daughter were delighted for me. For the first time, I felt people had some understanding of what I do every day and maybe appreciated it a little bit more. It’s nice to feel I’m making a difference. I’m 73, but I don’t have plans to retire – there are a lot more toilets for me to clean.‘We make every customer feel as if they are being welcomed into our home’View image in fullscreen‘You couldn’t do this job if you didn’t love people’ … Hiten and Kinnari Patel at their shopKinnari Pateland her husband,Hiten,were namedconveniencestore of theyear –independentby theFederation of Independent RetailersHiten and I took over Honey’s of the High, a convenience store in the centre of Oxford, 13 years ago. We both had stressful jobs in London, and we wanted to have our own business.When Honey’s came up for sale, we jumped at the chance to buy it. However, our children, then two and eight, didn’t want to move. We decided to stay in London but commute seven days a week to Oxford. It’s worth it to come to work in such a beautiful location.Hiten and I work alternate days at the shop. We leave the house at 4.30am, start the paper round an hour later, and close the shop at 7pm, to be home by 9.30pm.We last had a family holiday in 2018, for six days over Christmas. The shop was closed, but my brother ran the paper deliveries for us. We called him every single day.We try to make every customer feel as though they are being welcomed into our home. It’s a world away from my previous job in logistics. This feels much more important. You couldn’t do this job if you didn’t love people.Society in general lacks an element of connection these days. So many people do their shopping by the click of a button, but with a corner shop, you have that connection and interaction with others.We reassure the parents of new students after they drop them off at university, and let them know we’ll look out for their children.When the shop is quiet, I call up the care home we deliver papers to for a chat with anyone who is lonely. We started doing that in Covid, but we’ve carried it on.We were told we had been nominated for the award, and when they read out our names as the winners, we were just gobsmacked. It means we’ve really made a difference to people, and all the years of hard work and sacrifice have meant something to someone besides us.‘Everyone gets a high-five or fist bump when they cross the road’View image in fullscreen‘It’s the best job I’ve ever done’ … Gerald Gleeson, pictured with Luke CliffGerald Gleeson, fromCounty Cork, was namedlollipopperson of theyear byTonstix, makers ofchildren’s lollipop lozengesI became a lollipop man 10 years ago. I was widowed in 2014, and then retired after 30 years as a retained firefighter. I felt a bit lost. Spending time with my five grandchildren kept me going, but during term time I missed them so much.I saw an advert for a job as a lollipop person at my local school and thought I’d give it a go, just to get me out of the house. It’s the best job I’ve ever done, but it’s not for everyone. I’m up and out early every morning, come rain or shine, and I have to have a smile on my face. If you don’t have a sunny disposition, you won’t get on well in this job.People seem to think it’s an easy job, and can belittle it, but there’s an incredible responsibility that comes with it. Getting the children safely across a busy road is difficult, as every parent knows, and I try to make sure that they’re going in to school with a smile on their face, too. I make sure everyone gets a high-five or fist-bump when they cross if they want one. Some mums have told me it helps get their children in to school when they’re having a tough time, and I’m really proud to make a difference to their day.Some parents told me they’d nominated me for lollipop man of the year, and I couldn’t believe it. When the school told me I’d won, I was so shocked. There was a tremendous buzz about the crossing that afternoon; all the children wanted extra fist-bumps. It’s really lovely to know I’m making a difference – the award meant more to me than most people realised.‘I’m 65 and I love conkers. If that makes me an anorak, I’m OK with it’View image in fullscreen‘It’s one of the least dull things that’s ever happened to me’ … St John Burkett.Photograph: David HodsonSt John Burkettwas namedanorak of theyearby theDull Men’s ClubI’ve been a member of the Dull Men’s Club for more than 20 years, in my capacity as one of the coordinators of the World Conker Championships. I’ve featured in its annual calendar before, but I was shocked – and immensely happy – to find out I’d won the title of anorak of the year. Ironically, it’s one of the least dull things that’s ever happened to me.I was more excited to find out that I’d won than I would have been if they’d said I was getting an MBE. It’s such an honour, and I feel it shows I’m not taking life too seriously.My wife, Claire, was less impressed. When I told her, she raised one eyebrow and walked off. My adult children were more excited.They’ve put up with me going on about conkers for years. I’ve played since I was a little boy; I’m now 65 and still love the game. I’ll talk to anyone about them. If that makes me an anorak, I’m OK with that. I’m joining a long list of worthy winners.This year, I managed to help avert a near-disaster when the warm weather meant that the conkers were ready too soon and the competition, held in mid-October, was at risk because of a shortage of playable conkers.I spoke out in the press about the shortage, and we were inundated with donations from very kind people – including a box that weresent from the PR team at Windsor Castle. We assume they were picked by one of the residents. Maybe that helped me clinch the title.‘I can eat 25 bratwurst in five minutes’View image in fullscreen‘I eat sensibly most of the time’ … Max Stanford.Photograph: undefined/Courtesy of Max StanfordMax Stanfordis theBritish Eating League’schampion competitive eaterI sort of fell into competitive eating. I’d been trying to bulk up at the gym and someone suggested I should try out a Man v Food-style eating challenge. I realised I had a bit of a knack for it.I’m quite a competitive person – mostly with myself – and I was curious to see how far I could go.Five years on, I have a huge social media following that sees me competing in food challenges set by the British Eating League. It’s not my day job; I just compete for fun.There are about 10 individual competitions throughout the year, and whoever wins the most is given that year’s title. I’ve won before, three times, so it was a matter of pride for me to try to take the title again.Some of my favourite rounds in this year’s competition were a pie-eating contest (18 in five minutes), bratwurst-eating (25 in five minutes) and pretzel-eating (17 in five minutes – the second-placed competitor managed only three).I’m hesitant to call competitive eating a sport, but you do need to train and practise as though you were training for a marathon. I do a trial run a few times before an event, and the night before I stretch my stomach with lots of water and salad.I eat sensibly most of the time, and I run and hit the gym pretty hard too, which keeps me in shape.There’s no cash prize for winning competitive eater of the year, although some individual competitions do offer prizes of a few hundred pounds. It’s just for the glory, and a lovely trophy. I’m good friends with a lot of other competitors, but we all want to win. I find it weirdly satisfying to know that I can eat more chicken nuggets in five minutes than anyone else in the country.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She spent the first months of the invasion helping as a volunteer, then moved into drone work as more men from her region were killed or mobilised. “It wasn’t about whether I was ready,” she says. “It was about the fact that there were fewer people left.”Her motivation, she insists, is simple. Her two children now live inEurope, and she wants them to return to a safe Ukraine. Her father, 89, survived the second world war. The weight of that history stays with her. “I don’t want my children to become the next generation of war children. That’s all the motivation I need.”View image in fullscreenDasha preparing a Baba Yaga drone for flightShe now leads a mixed-gender unit operating a few kilometres from the eastern frontline. The atmosphere is one of exhaustion rather than heroism. “This isn’t about women proving anything,” she says. “It’s about necessity. Everyone is stretched. Everyone is adapting.”Elisabeth, 30: first-person-view drone pilotView image in fullscreenElisabeth’s first experience of the war was the sound. Her town came under repeated bombardment in 2022, and she spent weeks sleeping in stairwells and basements. “After a while you stop asking what you can do,” she says. “You ask what is still possible.”Wives, mothers, fighters, activists: the millennial women keeping Ukraine goingRead moreHer FPV training coincided with a period of heavy losses in her region, and several members of her team were injured within months of deployment. The dynamic inside the units shifted quickly. “People stopped caring who was a woman or who wasn’t,” she says. “They cared who could fly.”What she struggles with most is the psychological weight: the long hours, the constant threat of detection by Russian drones and the knowledge that every mission might involve killing, or losing someone she knows. “It doesn’t get easier,” she says. “You just get used to carrying it.”Ilona, 24: trainee at a drone school near KyivView image in fullscreenIlona enrolled at a civilian-accessible drone school after months of watching Russian aerial attacks intensify around her home. She had no military experience and little confidence she would fit in. “I thought drones were for professionals,” she says. “People who grew up with technology. Not me.”View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Ilona and other trainees during a class on how to repair and build drones; Right: Students learn how to operate the dronesThe training centre keeps a low profile, changing locations after being targeted several times. Trainees accept this as part of the routine. “You understand very quickly that drone operators are hunted,” she says. “You feel it from the first day.”What stands out most to her is not the danger, but the demand. Hundreds of people – many of them civilians – join the waiting lists for training each month. “So many men my age are already gone,” she says. “Someone has to take their place.”View image in fullscreenDasha says she wants her children, who are currently living in Europe, to return to a safe UkraineExplore more on these topicsUkraine in depthDrones (military)UkraineWomen's rights and gender equalityEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

They said they had formed “the high military command for the restoration of order”, which would rule the country until further notice.Earlier on Wednesday, shots were heard near the election commission headquarters, presidential palace and interior ministry, although it was not clear who was responsible.The military takeover is the latest in a string of coups and attempted coups in Guinea-Bissau since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974. The average yearly income in the country of 2.2 million people was just $963 (£728) in 2024, according to theWorld Bank.The UNlabelled Guinea-Bissau a “narco state”in 2008 because of its role as ahub for the global cocaine trade. Situated between Senegal and Guinea, its coastlinefeaturesnumerous river deltas and the 88 islands of the Bijagós archipelago, which experts said had provided the natural, discrete drop-off points used by Colombian drug cartels.The incumbent president, Umaro Sissoco Embaló, had been vying to become the first president to win a second term in power in three decades. Both he and his main rival, Fernando Dias, claimed they won in the first round of elections, held on Sunday.Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesperson for Embaló claimed the shots were being fired by gunmen affiliated to Dias. But a Dias ally blamed Embaló for trying to simulate a coup attempt so that he could declare an emergency and retain power. Neither provided any evidence for their claims.The election commission was due to announce provisional results in the presidential and parliamentary elections on Thursday.There have been at least nine coups in Guinea-Bissau between independence and Embaló taking office in 2020, according to Reuters. Embaló claimed to have survived three coup attempts during his first term in office, the most recent in October.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That statement comes despite worsening instability from gang violence in Haiti and political turmoil that has forced more than arecord 1.4 million peoplefrom their homes this year.Despite acknowledging that “certain conditions inHaitiremain concerning”, including mass displacement and gang violence, and that the country’s turmoil has “spillover effects … [that] threaten not only Haiti but the stability of the wider Caribbean and the western hemisphere”. The notice nonetheless argues that allowing Haitians to remain in the United States is “contrary to the US national interest”.The notice continued: “As is widely known, Haiti lacks a central authority with sufficient availability and dissemination of law enforcement information necessary to ensure its nationals do not undermine the national security of the United States.”It added: “Our immigration policy must align with our foreign policy vision of a secure, sovereign, and self-reliant Haiti and not a country that Haitian citizens continue to leave in large numbers to seek opportunities in the United States.”The latest move from the DHS, which followsUnicef estimatesin October that more than 6 million Haitians, including 3.3 million children, require urgent humanitarian assistance, comes as Trump continues hiswidespread crackdownon immigration including temporary protections for nationals of certain countries.In July, a federal judgehaltedthe Trump administration’s effort to end TPS and work permits for about 521,000 Haitian migrants ahead of schedule. Earlier this year, the DHS had reversed Joe Biden’s 2024 extension of TPS for Haitians – shortening their status to end on 2 September instead of 3 February of next year.However, US district judge Brian Cogan ruled that Noem had failed to follow the congressionally mandated process for reviewing Haiti’s TPS designation.Throughout his presidential campaign, Trumpclaimed baselesslythat Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio were eating cats and dogs – misinformation that was quickly picked up andspreadby other prominent Republicans including JD Vance and Ted Cruz, resulting inmultiple bomb threatsacross the city last year.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationHaitiAmericasTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Washington has accused Maduro of leading one narco “cartel” – the “Cartel of the Suns”, which was this week designateda foreign terrorist organization– although many experts say the group does not actually exist.“I’m not going to tell you what the goal is. You should probably know what the goal is,” Trump said of his crusade, indicating he “might” talk to Maduro.“If we can save lives, if we can do things the easy way, that’s fine. And if we have to do it the hard way, that’s fine too,” the US president told reporters.Trump’s future plans for South America’s sixth-largest country – and the nation with the world’s largest proven oil reserves – remain shrouded in mystery.“Maduro and most of his cohorts view the US military threats as a bluff,” a source with regular contact with top Venezuela officialstold the Wall Street Journalthis week.3:34'War on drugs' or political agitation? Assessing Trump's actions in Venezuela – video explainer“Maduro believes that the only way the US can oust him is by sending troops to Caracas,” that person added.Given Trump’s reluctance to send US troops into combat overseas, that looks highly unlikely. But many observers suspect that, after conducting more than 10 deadly airstrikes targeting supposed drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea, Trump’s next step will be US strikes on Venezuelan soil.“I think that we’re going to start blowing things up. I think we have to do something because there’s too big a force there [in the Caribbean] to not do something,” said Douglas Farah, a national security consultant and Latin America expert who advised the US government on Venezuela during Trump’s first term.Farah said his biggest fear was that – even if the US did launch some kind of attack, perhaps targeting a major Caribbean port out of which cocaine was smuggled – that would fail to topple Maduro, just as Trump failed to topple him in 2019.“[If that happens] Maduro will feel empowered. He’ll say: ‘Yeah, I defeated the United States,’” Farah said. And any chance of the Venezuelan dictator leaving power “in some sort of orderly fashion will be gone again for another 10 years”.Explore more on these topicsNicolás MaduroVenezuelaDonald TrumpAmericasUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

The complex is made up of eight 31-storey towers containing about 2,000 flats, which house about 4,800 people.Authorities said early on Thursday that three men aged between 52 and 68 had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire.The city’s leader, John Lee, said in the early hours of Thursday morning that the fire was “coming under control”.Authorities declared the incident a five-alarm fire, the highest emergency rating, and at least 128 fire engines and almost 800 firefighters were dispatched to the scene. Roads including major highways near the towers have been closed.Slow zoom out of one of the towers on fire during day“The priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the residents who are trapped,” Lee said. “The second is to support the injured. The third is to support and recover. Then, we’ll launch a thorough investigation.”Shortly after the fire broke out, Derek Armstrong Chan, the deputy director of Hong Kong’s fire services operations, said: “The temperature inside the buildings concerned is very high. It’s difficult for us to enter the building and go upstairs to conduct firefighting and rescue operations.”At least one firefighter, named as Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among the dead.Videos from the scene show flames spread across the towers and visible on every floor, flaring out of windows.Night scene shows fire engulfing many of the towersDozens of shocked residents, many sobbing, watched from nearby pavements as smoke funnelled up from the complex.“There’s nothing that can be done about the property. We can only hope that everyone, no matter old or young, can return safely,” a Tai Po resident who gave their surname as So told Agence France-Presse near the scene of the fire. “It’s heartbreaking. We’re worried there are people trapped inside.”Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block 2 in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise about 2.45pm (6.45am UK time) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block. “I immediately went back to pack up my things,” he told Reuters. “I don’t even know how I feel right now. I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight because I probably won’t be able to go back home.”0:57Several trapped as fire engulfs high-rise residential complex in Hong Kong – videoA resident who gave his surname as Wong, 71, broke down in tears, saying his wife was trapped inside one of the buildings.The Wang Fuk Court towers are among the tallest in Tai Po, which, like much of Hong Kong, is among the most densely populated areas in the world. Many residents are elderly, according to 2021 census data reported by CNN.The Hong Kong government said all departments were coordinating to assist the response effort and affected residents.China’s leader, Xi Jinping, expressed his condolences for the victims, China’s state broadcaster said late on Wednesday.Map of Hong Kong.Officials were reported as saying the fire had started in some of theexternal bamboo and mesh scaffolding that encased the towersbefore spreading inside them, but the exact cause is unknown.Building standards in Hong Kong are relatively high and vastly improved in recent decades, but the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims, a local advocacy group, expressed deep concern about fires associated with scaffolding, noting similar incidents in April, May and October.Hong Kong’s high property prices have long been a source of social discontent in the city and the fire could stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.View image in fullscreenFirefighters tackle the blaze.Photograph: Kobe Li/Nexpher/Zuma Press/ShutterstockBamboo scaffolding is a ubiquitous sight across Hong Kong’s construction and renovation sites, though the government has said it was being phased out for safety reasons.The Tai Po district authorities have opened shelters in local community halls, at least one of which local media reported was full by Wednesday night, and police have set up acasualty hotline.Several forums and campaign events related to the 7 December elections that had been scheduled for the coming days have been cancelled.The fire is the most deadly in Hong Kong in years.

The blaze tore through the Wang Fuk Court residential complex in Tai Po, in the northern New Territories. The complex is made up of eight 31-storey towers containing about 2,000 flats that house about 4,800 people.The exact cause of the fire is unknown but the bamboo scaffolding and green construction mesh may have helped it to spread quickly across the apartments.Hong Kong is one of the last places in the world where bamboo is widely used for construction. The intricate lattices of poles bound together by zip ties and wrapped around gleaming sky-scrapers are a ubiquitous sight across the city.1:26Three arrested as Hong Kong tower fire leaves dozens dead - videoBamboo is valued for being lighter and cheaper than metal alternatives. Its use in construction is also seen as an art form in its own right, with bamboo towers being depicted in Han dynasty scroll paintings from 2,000 years ago. The plant is abundant in southernChina, although most building sites in the mainland now use metal scaffolds as standard.In March the government said it would start phasing out the use of bamboo in favour of fire-resistant steel because of safety concerns. It said 50% of public construction works would be required to use metal frames. As well as being fire-resistant, metal withstands Hong Kong’s humid weather better than bamboo.Industrial accidents involving bamboo scaffolds have killed 23 people since 2018, according to official figures.But the Hong Kong and Kowloon Bamboo Scaffolding Workers Unionhas previously said it opposes the retirement of bamboo. The natural variation in the size and shape of the poles means that binding them together into a scaffold requires the skilled eye of bamboo masters, who fear their livelihoods may be at risk if Hong Kong transitions to steel frames.Explore more on these topicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificHong Kong apartment firesnewsShareReuse this content"

China launched a swathe of economic retaliations in response. It has also been further angered by Japanese plans to install a missile on Yonaguni Island,Japan’s closest territory to Taiwan, just 110km off its east coast.Tokyo’s defence minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, visited Yonaguni on Saturday, telling press that preparations were “progressing steadily” for the installation of a medium-range, surface-to-air missile deployment.China’s government accusedJapanof deliberately stoking regional tensions.“Japan’s deployment of offensive weapons in areas adjacent to China’s Taiwan region is extremely dangerous, deliberately creating regional tensions and provoking military confrontation,” said Peng on Wednesday.“We have a firm will, strong determination and a strong ability to defend our national sovereignty and territorial integrity… We will crush all foreign interference.”Lillian Yang and agencies contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsTaiwanChinaJapanAsia PacificDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

If today we legitimise and formalise the undermining of borders, we open the doors for more wars tomorrow, and we cannot let this happen.”The US continues to push for an end to the conflict. Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff – who wasexposed for coaching the Kremlinon the best way to win the US leader’s favour – is expected to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow early next week, while the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, will meet the Ukrainian side.View image in fullscreenVon der Leyen said so far we have seen ‘no signs of true willingness to end the conflict’.Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPAVon der Leyen welcomed Trump’s efforts to find peace, describing them as “a starting point”, but made clear that Europe had many concerns about the details outlined in the original 28-point US-Russian plan. Some of the maximalistRussia-friendly demands have since been removed, Ukraine has said, and the US president has rowed back on his Thursday deadline tied to the US holiday of Thanksgiving amidlittle sign of progress on key sticking points.Describing the situation as volatile and dangerous, von der Leyen said she saw “an opportunity here to make real progress”, adding: “So far we have seen no signs fromRussiaof true willingness to end this conflict. So we have to keep up the pressure on Russia.”In a hastily arranged video call on Wednesday, EU foreign ministers “reaffirmed our shared principles”, according to Europe’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, referring to sovereignty, independence, territorial independence and “Ukraine’s inherent right to self-defence”.View image in fullscreenKaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, said there was ‘zero indication’ that Russia was ready for a ceasefire.Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPAKallas, a former prime minister of Estonia, said everyone welcomed the US push for peace, before setting out an analysis of the conflict that vastly differed from the worldview informing the 28-point plan.“Right now we see zero indication that Russia is ready for a ceasefire,” she said. “We still need to get from a situation where Russia pretends to negotiate to a situation where they need to negotiate. We are getting there.”Kallas referred to the “failed” Russian summer offensive and the impact of western sanctions on Russia’s economy. “The notion that Ukraine is losing is also flat out false. If Russia could conquer Ukraine militarily, it would have already done so by now. Putin cannot achieve its goals on the battlefield, so he will try to negotiate his way there.”She said that in the last century Russia had attacked more than 19 countries, some three or four times. “So in any peace agreement, we have to put the focus on how to get concessions from the Russian side that they stop the aggression for good and do not try to change borders by force.”EU officials also argue against limits on Ukraine’s armed forces. Such a restriction would “leave the country vulnerable to future attacks”, von der Leyen said, adding that Ukraine also needed “robust, credible and long-term security guarantees”.In a leaked recording, Witkoff told a senior Kremlin official last month that achieving peace in Ukraine would require Russia gaining control of Donetsk and potentially a separate territorial exchange. The original 28-point plan called on Ukraine to cede the entire Donetsk region to Russia, including areas under Ukrainian control.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin and Steve Witkoff in August.

A senior Kremlin aide, Yuri Ushakov, told state TV that Moscow had seen the latest version of the US plan, saying: “Some aspects can be viewed positively, but many require special discussions among experts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

EU leadersfailed to endorse the idealast month because of legal doubts from Belgium, which hosts about €183bn of assets, most of Russia’s sovereign wealth in the EU and two-thirds of the worldwide total.Trump’s proposal for the US to take 50% profits on a US-led venture to “rebuild and invest in Ukraine” based on $100bn from the Russian frozen assets is adding to pressure on European leaders to resolve the issue. The US also wants Europe to contribute $100bn to the reconstruction investment fund.Von der Leyen reiterated her support for the frozen assets plan – an EU loan to Ukraine secured on the assets and the idea that Russia would pay reparations to Kyiv – saying: “I cannot see any scenario in which the European taxpayers alone will pay the bill.”EU leaders will discuss the frozen assets question next month as they try to nail down a 2026-27 funding deal for Kyiv, which is expected to run out of money next spring.Von der Leyen said another European priority was the return of Ukrainian children forcibly deported to Russia. She said: “There are tens of thousands of boys and girls whose fate is unknown, trapped in Russia by Russia. We will not forget them.”Ukraine’s government hasidentified nearly 20,000 childrenwho have been unlawfully deported or forcibly transferred to Russia since the full-scale invasion in 2022. A Ukrainian organisation working on the issue, Bring Kids Back, has said 1,835 children have returned from deportation, forced transfers and occupied Ukraine.Putin is wanted for alleged war crimes by the international criminal court over the abductions.

Although not legally binding, it raises pressure for European legislation amid growing alarm about themental healthrisks to children of unfettered internet access.The European Commission, which is responsible for initiating EU law, is already studying Australia’sworld-first social-media banfor under-16s, which is due to take effect next month.In a speech in September, the commission’s president,Ursula von der Leyen, said she would watch the implementation of Australia’s policy. She spoke out against “algorithms that prey on children’s vulnerabilities with the explicit purpose of creating addictions” and said parents felt powerless against “the tsunami of big tech flooding their homes”.Von der Leyen promised a panel of experts would be set up by the end of the year to advise on the best approach to protecting children.Interest is growing in restricting children’s social media and smartphone access. An expert report commissioned last year by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said children should not be allowed to use smartphonesuntil the age of 13and social media, such as TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat, until they were 18.Christel Schaldemose, the Danish Social Democrat MEP who drafted the resolution, told reporters that politicians needed to act to protect children: “It is not just parents. Society also needs to step up and make sure that platforms are a safe place for minors to be, but only if they are above a certain age.”Her report called for the default disabling of addictive features on internet platforms when used by minors, such as infinite scrolling (endless content as the user scrolls down), videos that automatically play, excessive push notifications and rewards for repeated use of a site.The resolution noted that “addictive design features are often inherent to the business model of platforms, notably social media”. An earlier draft of the Schaldemose report citeda studystating that one in four children and young people displayed “problematic” or “dysfunctional” smartphone use – behavioural patterns mirroring addiction. The resolution said children should be 16 before they could access social media, although parents could give consent from the age of 13.The White House is urging the EU to roll back its digital laws and some supporters of a social media ban explicitly framed the vote in this context. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said EU rules on tech companies needed to be more “balanced” in exchange for lower US steel and aluminium tariffs.Referring to Lutnick’s visit, Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, a French MEP from Macron’s party, said Europe was not “a regulatory colony”. In a statement after the vote, she added: “Our digital laws are not for sale. We will not back down on children’s protections because a foreign billionaire or big tech tells us to.”The EU already seeks to protect internet users from online harms, such as disinformation, cyberbullying and illegal content, via its Digital Services Act. But the resolution said this law had gaps and could do more to protect children from addictive design features and online exploitation, such as financial incentives to become influencers.Schaldemose said the act, which she co-authored, was strong “but we could go further, especially in areas of addictive design features and harmful dark pattern practices where we are not so specific, not so precise”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Meanwhile, Washington has made it clear that it expects its EU allies to take care of much more of their own defence.Graph of EU armed forces personnelBut if the issue of defence industry investment is chiefly economic, the question of how to significantly expand the number of full-time armed services members is also very much societal – and is leading to heated debates across several countries.Fabien Mandon, France’s top general and chief of staff of the armed forces, prompted media and political uproar last week by saying the country must be ready “to lose its children” since Russia was “preparing for a confrontation with our countries by 2030”.View image in fullscreenFabien Mandon, France’s chief of staff of the armed forces, said last week that the country must be ready to ‘lose its children’.Photograph: Julien de Rosa/EPAThe International Institute for Strategic Studies thinktankwrote in a recent report: “Most European armies struggle to meet their recruitment targets and retain trained personnel, as well as to generate a sufficient reserve.”Sophia Besch, a defence specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said “growing military personnel shortfalls” were forcing more and more western European countries to explore various kinds of conscription models.“Training cycles will also need to be intensified for reservists, which some countries need to reactivate in large numbers,”Besch wrote in a report this summer. “For countries without a tradition of military preparedness, all this poses a politically and socially sensitive challenge.”Several EU countries have some form of conscription, led by the Nordics and Baltics where “total defence” underpins military thinking and draft intakes are widening. Finland has one of the world’s largest reserves, based on universal male conscription.Sweden reintroduced selective conscription – with mandatory registration for men and women, but a strict selection process that takes into account several factors including physical fitness and youths’ “willingness to serve” – in 2018.Denmark’s conscription systemwas extended to women and lengthenedto 11 months from four in June. Estonia has universal male conscription, while Latvia and Lithuania, like Denmark, select conscripts by lottery if there are not enough volunteers.View image in fullscreenMembers of the Lithuanian army march during a military parade ceremony. Lithuania, Latvia and Denmark select conscripts by lottery if there are not enough volunteers.Photograph: Mindaugas Kulbis/APElsewhere, Croatia, which abolished mandatory military service 18 years ago, recently restored conscription, while Poland is working on a plan to prepare large-scale military training for every adult male in an effort to double the size of its army.Whilerecent pollshave found that majorities in several European countries, including Germany, France and Poland, support some form of mandatory military service, other countries have so far steered clear of conscription.Germany’s government this monthdecided against a system of compulsory military service after a bitter debate, opting for a voluntary model instead – but if that fails to find the numbers, it will reconsider a compulsory nationwide call-up.France’s proposed scheme is unlikely to include reintroducing the mandatory military service abolished in 1997. Several countries offer perks such as cash bonuses, preferential access to public sector jobs and higher education places to military service volunteers.Army leaders generally say that volunteers are more professional and motivated than conscripts, but volunteer armies are expensive. Conscripts not only make up the numbers of active service personnel, but provide a large pool of potential reservists.Compulsory military service, however, is no panacea and can be counterproductive. “In countries where there is domestic resistance, mandatory conscription could even undermine public resolve to shore up the national defences,”Besch argued.“Most successful European conscription models now rely on a strong degree of volunteerism – but instilling a willingness to serve in a population that does not have a recent history of military service takes time and sustained domestic debate.”Explore more on these topicsEuropeFranceEuropean UnionRussiaEmmanuel MacronnewsShareReuse this content"

Is it ready to defend Kyiv against the imposition of a lopsided “peace” that rewardsVladimir Putinand undermines the entire continent’s security?Not for the first time, European governments were left in the dark about secret US-backed proposals to end Russia’s war. Leaked to the media last week, the latest incendiary 28-point plan was so slanted in Russia’s favour thatthere are suspicionsit was partly drafted in the Kremlin (complete withclunkily translatedRussian syntax).The terms of this shockingly punitive plan would freeze battle lines but require Kyiv to cede swathes of territory that it still controls; drastically curb the size of its army; accept amnesty for Russian atrocities and war crimes; and stay out of Nato for good. No wonderPresident Zelenskyy told his compatriotsthat it left them facing one of the most difficult moments of their history.Nonetheless, in a hurry to claim credit for peace – seemingly at any price – Donald Trump gave Ukraine an ultimatum: sign off on Russia’s shopping list by Thanksgiving or, it was implied, risk losing US intelligence and military aid: anot-so festive deadline.The days since have felt like a repetition of August, when Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin in Alaska and left sidelined European leaders dashing to the White House en masse, flanking Zelenskyy, to limit the damage.This time, despite Trump upbraiding the Ukraine president for “zero gratitude”, emergency talks in Geneva have reportedlytweaked the planto “uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty”. Trump hassoftened his language(and deadline), claiming that negotiations with Ukraine are bearing fruit and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will soon be back in Moscow.If a more palatable deal is in the offing, it may be becauseFrance, Germany and the UK have helped Ukraineto push back. It is not only about solidarity: these countries may be required to put “boots on the ground” to uphold an eventual deal.Foot in the doorView image in fullscreen‘Europeans have agency’ … Steve Witkoff, left, seen here in April, is expected to return to Moscow.Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/APThere is, however, no reason to believe that Moscow will buy into any plan that doesn’t involve Kyiv’s capitulation – or even thatRussiaseeks to end the war. “Putin sees no problem with continuing the war,” Tatiana Stanovaya, of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told the Guardian’s Russian affairs reporter, Pjotr Sauer.At such a perilous moment then, the onus is more than ever on Europe to demand thatUkrainegets a just peace – both morally and out of self-interest for the security of Ukraine’s European neighbours.But how can Europe prevent a US stitch-up, particularly if Moscow maintains its most unreasonable territorial demands and Trump loses patience with Zelenskyy? Getting ahead of any Trump/Putin summit is key, say analysts. Ukraine’s European backers need be clearer with Trump thatUkraine’s security is Europe’s security.“Europeans complain about not being at the table, but they have agency,” Jana Kobzova, a Ukraine expert with the European Council for Foreign Relations,said on the thinktank’s podcast. “They can put their foot in the door and say these are the things that we are not going to tolerate.”Europe is already shouldering most of the cost of Ukraine’s resistance, even if it has been too hesitant, divided, or complacent to give Kyiv the negotiating cards it needs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The confiscated assets (mostly held in a repository in Belgium) could transform Ukraine’snear-bankrupt statusand help it win the war. But the proposal also stipulated using $100bn of these Russian assets for investment, with the US keeping 50% of the profits. Now the EU must urgently decide if it wants to move on the assets first, or dig deep to find alternative cash.Brussels suspects that Russia’s economy is in a worse state than it will acknowledge, thanks to such measures asa new EU banon Russian gas imports. “They [Moscow] want us to believe they can continue this war for ever. This is not true,” Kaja Kallas, the EU high representative and former Estonian PM, told the BBC.The stakes are perilous for Europe if Moscow gets away with changing borders by force. “If Ukraine capitulates as per Russia’s plan, war in the rest of Europe is one step closer, and Europeans understand this. So it’s not out of the goodness of their heart that they would stick with Ukraine, but because they understand that their own security is at stake,” Nathalie Tocci, director of the Italian Institute for International Affairs and a Guardian Europe contributor, told me.For Tocci, the most likely medium-term scenario is not Ukrainian surrender, but one in which the US and Russia (egged on by US hawks, including JD Vance) reach a bilateral deal, leaving Europe to stick with Ukraine.“In this scenario, Europeans should stop deluding themselves that they can work with Trump on Ukraine. They should warmly thank the US president and persuade him to step aside and place his bets on another conflict to get his Nobel peace prize. Either way, the war goes on for now”.To receive the complete version of This Is Europe in your inbox every Wednesday,please subscribe here.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsThis is EuropeEuropeUkraineRussiaVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropean UnionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

The Israeli militarysaid it had killed six Hamas militantswho “most likely” had emerged from a tunnel near Rafah, the city in the south of the devastated Palestinian territory.There was no independent confirmation of the claim, but there have been a series of clashes in recent days in the half of Gaza controlled by Israeli forces involving militants trapped in tunnels.On Tuesday, Hamas handed over the remains of Dror Or, an Israeli hostage killed with his wife when their home was stormed by attackers from the Islamist organisation during thesurprise raidinto Israel in October 2023 that triggered the conflict in Gaza. The remains of two hostages – one Israeli, one Thai – remain in Gaza. Israel has agreed to release 15 Palestinian bodies for each hostage returned.In total, militants fromHamasand allied factions killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 to Gaza during the attack. Almost 70,000 Palestinians were killed and 170,863 injured in the ensuring Israeli offensive, including hundreds since the fragile ceasefire came into effect last month.The next phases of Donald Trump’s20-point planto end the conflict in Gaza, include developing an international body to govern Gaza and oversee reconstruction under a two-year renewable UN mandate. An armed international stabilisation force is to keep security and ensure the disarming of Hamas, a key demand of Israel. The implementation of almost every part of the plan faces massive challenges.Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has spiked since October 2023 and has continued after the ceasefire.According to theUN, Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza. UN officials attributed most of these fatalities to “the systematic and excessive use of lethal force by Israeli forces, often involving live fire, airstrikes and shoulder-fired missiles in densely populated areas, resulting in numerous civilian deaths, including children”.At least 44 Israelis, including soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or during Israeli military operations in the West Bank,according to the UN.Earlier this week, Human Rights Watch said in a report that the Israeli government’s forced displacement of the populations of West Bank refugee camps in January and February 2025 amounted to war crimes andcrimes against humanity.The32,000 peoplereportedly displaced from the camps have not been permitted to return to their homes, many of which Israel forces have deliberately demolished, the international campaign group said.Explore more on these topicsWest BankIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestineMiddle East and north AfricaHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

The court of appeal in October last year upheld a high court ruling that the State Immunity Act 1978 does not give Bahrain sovereign immunity against their claims.Section 5 of the act provides that a state does not have immunity from claims for personal injury caused by an act or omission that happened in the UK. The ruling will also provide clarity in relation to other spyware claims being brought on behalf of clients by the international team at the law firm Leigh Day.Shehabi and Mohammed allege that their laptops were infected at some point in September 2011 with malicious surveillance software. They believe the infection was carried out, directed, authorised or caused by the Bahraini government or its agents.In a statement, Leigh Day claimed that “FinSpy software can collect vast amounts of data from the devices it infects, including recording every keystroke, voice calls, messages, emails, calendar records, instant messaging, contacts lists, browsing history, photos, databases, documents and videos. It allows recording of live audio from the device’s microphone and camera.”The court of appeal found that the remote manipulation, from abroad, of a computer located in the UK constituted an act within the UK. Even if the hacking occurred abroad, the effect was that the territorial sovereignty of the UK had suffered interference.A foreign state does not have immunity for personal injury caused by an act in the UK, even if some of the acts take place abroad. The court also ruled that “personal injury” as defined in the state immunity act included standalone psychiatric injury.The appeal court ruling stated Bahrain denied the claimants’ allegations of infecting the dissident’s computers with spyware, but the high court judge “found, on the basis of expert evidence, that the claimants had discharged the burden upon them of proving on the balance of probabilities that their computers were infected by spyware by Bahrain’s servants or agents”. The validity of this finding could be challenged at a full trial of the allegations, if the supreme court rules Bahrain does not have immunity.Shehabi, a founder of the dissident party al-Wefaq. welcomed the supreme court hearing, saying: “I am pleased with the outcome so far of the court case in regards to the hacking of my computer. It sends a clear message to foreign governments who pursue their peaceful political opponents with various means including intruding into their private lives and equipment.”Mohammed, who fled Bahrain in 2006 after facing frequent detention inside the country, said: “Our journey has now reached the highest court in the land. I have a duty to expose what I endured when I believe Bahrain hacked my computer. The impact has been devastating – especially for those who placed their trust in me, and for my friends and family.“Abusive foreign states like Bahrain must be held accountable for wrecking our lives. They cannot be allowed to hide behind diplomatic immunity to advance their transnational repression on British soil.”Both men have had their Bahraini citizenship revoked.Ida Aduwa, a senior associate solicitor at l Leigh Day, said: “This case raises fundamental questions about accountability for the use of intrusive surveillance technology against political activists and members of civil society. Our clients, and many others we represent, have waited a long time for clarity on these issues.”Explore more on these topicsBahrainSurveillanceEspionageHackingMalwareMiddle East and north AfricaUK supreme courtnewsShareReuse this content"

While most can control their asthma with inhalers to treat immediate symptoms and preventive ones to reduce inflammation, those with the most severe asthma often take daily doses of oral corticosteroids as well.But long-term use is associated with serious health conditions, including osteoporosis, diabetes and increased vulnerability to infections.Now aninternational clinical trialhas found that participants who received injections oftezepelumabevery four weeks were able to reduce or even stop taking their steroids entirely with no ill effects.Tezepelumab, also known as Tezspire and made by AstraZeneca, binds to and blocks a protein associated with airway inflammation.Antibiotic resistance: how a pioneering trial is using old drugs to save babies from sepsisRead moreThe National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence approved the drug in 2023 as an additional maintenance treatment for patients over 12 whose usual medication does not control their asthma well.The Wayfinder trial, led by Kings College London, involved just under 300 adults with severe, uncontrolled asthma, who were taking 5mg-40mg of steroid tablets daily.The patients, from 11 countries including the UK, US, France, Germany, Mexico and Spain, were given tezepelumab every month.After one year of treatment, more than half of the participants had stopped taking their steroid medication altogether without their asthma flaring up, while nearly 90% had reduced their steroid use to a low dose. A third had stopped taking steroids after six months.Symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, breathlessness and chest tightness. Up to 10% of asthmatics have severe disease and, in the most extreme cases, it can be fatal.The trial findings, published in the the Lancet Respiratory Medicine and presented at the British Thoracic Society winter meeting, also showed that tezepelumab significantly improved asthma symptoms, lung function and overall quality of life. During the study, two-thirds of patients did not have any asthma attacks.The lead author of the study, prof David Jackson, who is a respiratory medicine expert at King’s College London and asthma services clinical lead at Guy’s and Royal Brompton hospitals, said: “As tezepelumab also suppresses allergy-related symptoms and improves chronic rhinosinusitis as well, the results are particularly exciting for patients with severe asthma who suffer with both upper and lower airway symptoms.”Responding to the findings, Dr Samantha Walker, the director of research and innovation atAsthma+ Lung UK, said: “This is an incredibly encouraging development for the future of asthma care that could transform the lives of people with severe asthma.“It’s vital that research into new types of treatment continues, but we know current funding for lung health research is on life support, despite lung conditions remaining the third biggest cause of death in the UK. Studies like this show the positive impact that research can make on providing potentially life-changing treatment for people with asthma and other lung conditions.”Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “Any new interventions that may help patients manage their symptoms more easily and in a safe and effective way would be welcome.“The prospect of a monthly injection, rather than daily tablets, may also be a more manageable treatment option for some patients.“As with any emerging research, it’s important the findings are carefully assessed and considered as clinical guidelines, which GPs use in their daily practice, are developed and updated, based on the latest evidence to ensure safety and benefit for patients.”Explore more on these topicsAsthmaMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The OBR said the threshold freeze would bring an additional 780,000 people into paying the basic rate of income tax; 920,000 into paying the higher rate; and another 4,000 would pay the additional rate.Budget 2025: key points at a glanceRead moreIn a series of well-trailed measures, the chancellor targeted the rich via a new council tax surcharge for properties worth more than £2m and announced a 2p tax increase on income from dividends, savings and property. Contributions to “salary sacrifice” pension schemes, on which employers pay no national insurance, will be capped at £2,000 from 2029 – bringing in a significant £4.7bn a year.Reeves later told journalists that she did not believe she had broken the Labour manifesto with the threshold freeze. “If you read the manifesto, we are very clear, we say ‘the rates of income tax, NI and VAT’, but if you are asking does this have a cost for working people, I acknowledge it does,” she said.The OBR said the tax squeeze would hit living standards, with real disposable household income scheduled to rise by just 0.25% a year over the forecast period – weaker than it expected in March..Financial markets responded positively as Reeves more than doubled the financial buffer she has left against her fiscal rules to £21.7bn, from less than £10bn in her spring statement.Yields on 10-year government bonds, or gilts, which move in the opposite direction to prices, were down 0.07 percentage points at 4.41% by late on Wednesday, lowering the cost of government borrowing..Labour MPs hailed the chancellor’s decision to spend £3bn a year on scrapping the controversial two-child benefit limit in full, a move the government said would lift 450,000 children out of poverty.“I don’t intend to preside over a status quo that punishes children for the circumstances of their birth,” the chancellor said to cheers from the Labour backbenches.Reeves also promised to bear down on inflation with a package of cost-of-living measures, including removing green subsidies from household energy bills and freezing rail fares.Levies on energy bills will now be paid out of general taxation, which the Treasury said could reduce bills by an average of £150 a year from next April.Labour MPs and ministers praised the budget as a shift leftwards – saying it had bought Keir Starmer and Reeves time from a much-rumoured leadership challenge.“This shows we are a full-blooded Labour government. In an ideal world we would have wanted welfare to come first but we are where we are. People want us to make an argument – so this is one. Wealthiest pay more and we protect those with greatest need,” one senior strategist said.But several others said the OBR showed the fundamental weakness in the economy remained – and that the deep reservations about Starmer’s leadership would not be calmed by this budget. “This does nothing to move the fundamentals,” one minister said. “Yet again there was an opportunity for boldness which has led to nothing much.”Another minister said: “This buys them a few months with backbenches and bond markets and it further cements hatred with my voters. But it delays the now inevitable reckoning.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was responding to weaker economic forecasts from the OBR, which now expects average GDP growth of 1.5% over the next five years – 0.3% slower than previously expected..Alongside the threshold freeze and the mansion tax, other revenue raisers announced by Reeves included a £1.1bn increase in tax on online gambling and a 3p-a-mile levy on electric vehicles. Rishi Sunak’s 5p cut to fuel duty was extended to next summer, but it will start to rise from next September.Gilt yields began falling even before Reeves stood up in the House of Commons, as traders digested the OBR’s budget document, mistakenly published on the watchdog’s website about 40 minutes before she was due to begin speaking.Jonas Goltermann, the deputy chief markets economist at CapitalEconomics, said: “The gilt market is breathing a sigh of relief after the much-anticipated UK budget announcement today delivered less bad news than feared and the chancellor appears to have, so far, come out of a fraught fiscal process a bit stronger.”Some analysts highlightedthe heavily backloaded natureof Reeves’s plans, however, with borrowing set to be higher over the next three years, and the bulk of the tax rises scheduled for the end of the parliament, to ensure she can meet her fiscal rule of covering day-to-day spending with taxes..“To bear down on borrowing in later years and deliver that increase in ‘headroom’, the chancellor is relying heavily on tax rises towards the back end of the parliament,” said Helen Miller, the director of theInstitute for Fiscal Studies(IFS). “More borrowing for the next few years, then a sharp adjustment. Spend now, pay later.“It’s one thing to promise a reduction in borrowing, and another to actually deliver it.”Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, welcomed the moves on cutting the cost of living but echoed the IFS’s caution. “This budget leaves much of the fiscal repair job to 2028 and beyond. Economic winds could change dramatically between now and then. The chancellor has taken the sensible step to increase her wiggle room at the start of the parliament but the effects will be felt at the end,” she said.Reeves addressed MPs in parliament on Wednesday night warning them that they would see a negative response on the newspaper front pages – but telling them it was up to them to sell the budget to voters.“Now, we’ve got to win the argument, and we’ve got to win the argument every single day. We have to win the argument for the budget. We’ve got to campaign on the budget – and that is what we must now do,” she said.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, dismissed Reeves’ statement as a “Benefits Street budget,” accusing her of “making ordinary people pay for her incompetence and her inability to face down Labour’s tax-hungry leftwing backbenchers”.Soft-left MPs said it was a victory for those who had spent time since the welfare rebellion pushing the party leftwards. The revived Tribune group of MPs, likely to be a vehicle for any future leadership battle for a leftwing candidate, praised the chancellor, calling it a “Labour budget, demonstrating Labour values”.But in a warning shot it said the budget should be “the start of a wider programme of modernisation. Future tax reforms must aim for simplicity, sustainability, and fairness – ensuring that hard work is rewarded, unearned income and wealth are taxed more consistently, and those with the broadest shoulders should continue to contribute proportionately to national renewal.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityBenefitsEnergy billsPublic financeUS Government borrowingnewsShareReuse this content"

But I never, ever, ever would have said or done anything like that directly to a human being. Absolutely not.”Analysis:Ettedgui is actually one of several contemporaries from minority ethnic backgrounds to claim Farage abused them when they were at school.Ettedgui, a Jewish student, has said: “[Farage] would sidle up to me and growl, ‘Hitler was right’ or ‘gas them’, sometimes adding a long hiss to simulate the sound of the gas showers.”Cyrus Oshidar has said Farage repeatedly called him a “Paki”.Another former pupil told the Guardian he was also directly targeted by Farage.“[Farage] walked up to a pupil, flanked by two similarly tall mates, and spoke to anyone looking ‘different’. That included me on three occasions; asking me where I was from, and pointing away, saying, ‘That’s the way back’ to wherever you replied you were from.”The claim:Farage suggested the allegation he abused Ettedgui had only come from Ettedgui himself.Analysis:This is wrong.Seven other contemporaries have come forward to say they saw Farage abusing Ettedgui with antisemitic language.Stefan Benarroch said: “[Ettedgui] was such a gentle soul and Farage – Farage made his life a fucking nightmare … They could only identify us, because we had to go to this stupid Jewish service in the science labs school. I mean, none of us were remotely religious. They would hang out there. Farage would hang out with his minions. And then they would taunt us as we would leave.”Rickard Berg said: “He definitely had a go at Peter and there were a couple of others he would also have a go at … He was nasty, there was no question. [The song] Gas ’em all, I heard him singing it to Ettedgui. I didn’t get it at the time, because Peter didn’t react. Back in the day, you thought it was for him to react.”Anthony Butler said: “I clearly recall him relentlessly hectoring and bullying Ettedgui with shouts of ‘stupid yid’ in the playground.” Butler offered an apology to Ettedgui.Jean-Pierre Lihou said: “[Farage] used to say things like, you know, ‘Jude’, to Peter, which is the German for Jew, in the way it was said in the 1930s, a long ‘u’ in a menacing way, you know? It’s pretty awful.”Bob Jope, a former teacher, said: “I think he [Farage] said ‘Shut up you Jew’ to Peter Ettedgui.”Martin Rosell said: “[Farage] certainly made comments to the Jewish guy in that class, Peter Ettedgui … Comments like, under his breath, sort of ‘Jew’ … and comments about how they ‘missed you’, that sort of thing.”Quick GuideContact Henry Dyer about this storyShowIf you have something to share about  this story, you can contact Henry using one of the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

None of them say, I directly attack them or abuse them,” Farage said. “What they do say, they do say, very clearly, is they have different political views to me.”Analysis:The overwhelming majority of the contemporaries that the Guardian has spoken to are not active in party politics.Some disagree with him, and dislike Reform, but they say they came forward because of his denials about his past behaviour – and their expectation that he should show some contrition.One of those who spoke out, Martin Rosell, is the chair of the Liberal Democrats in Salisbury. Farage was told this by the Guardian prior to publication. His account is supported by others.Farage has cited the example of Roger Gough, a former Conservative leader of Kent county council.But Gough was not among the individuals who claimed they had either been victims of, or witnesses to, racist and antisemitic behaviour by Farage.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageReform UKexplainersShareReuse this content"

The first district has been represented by Black members of Congress continuously for more than 30 years.The three-judge panel denied the preliminary injunction requests after a hearing in Winston-Salem in mid-November. The day after the hearing, the same judges separately upheld several other redrawn US House districts that GOP state lawmakers initially enacted in 2023. They were first used in the 2024 elections, contributing to Republicans gaining three more congressional seats.North Carolina is one of several states this year in which Trump has broken with more than a century of political tradition in directing the GOP to redraw maps in the middle of the decade – without courts requiring it – to avoid losing control of Congress in next year’s midterms.Democrats need to gain just three seats to win control of the House and impede Trump’s agenda. Besides North Carolina, Republican-led legislatures or commissions in Texas, Missouri, and Ohio all have adopted new districts designed to boost Republicans’ chances in next year’s elections.In California, voters have countered by adopting new districts drawn to improve Democrats’ chances of winning more seats. And the Democratic-led Virginia general assembly also has taken a step toward redistricting with a proposed constitutional amendment.Thus far, many lower courts have blocked Trump’s initiatives, only for the conservative majority on the US supreme court to put those rulings on hold. That includes a recent ruling in Texas, where a redrawn US House map is engineered to give Republicans five additional House seats.North Carolina’s Republican-controlled general assembly gave final approval on 22 October to changes that could help preserve a slim Republican majority in the US House Democratic governor Josh Stein’s approval was not needed.In a statement, North Carolina Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said the decision “thwarts the radical left’s latest attempt to circumvent the will of the people” in a state that voted for Trump in 2016, 2020 and 2024.“As Democrat-run states like California do everything in their power to undermine President Trump’s administration and agenda, North Carolina Republicans went to work to protect the America First agenda,” Berger said.The ruling covers two lawsuits.In one filed by the state NAACP, Common Cause and voters, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction on First Amendment grounds. They say Republican lawmakers unconstitutionally targeted North Carolina’s “Black belt” instead of Democratic-voting areas with higher white populations because in 2024 they organized and voted for their preferred candidates and had sued over the 2023 configuration of the district.In the second lawsuit, filed by voters, the case for a preliminary injunction rested in part on an argument that the use of five-year-old census data due to the mid-decade redrawing of districts violates the constitution, including the 14th amendment’s one-person, one-vote guarantee. Additionally, it says lawmakers relied on race in mapmaking in violation of the first and 14th amendments.Republicans now hold 10 of the state’s 14 House seats — thanks to the 2023 map – and they hope to flip an 11th under the latest redistricting changes to the first district and the adjoining 3rd District. This effort happened in a state where Trump got 51% of the popular vote in 2024 and statewide elections are often close. Candidate filing in these and scores of other 2026 North Carolina races has been slated to begin 1 December.Explore more on these topicsUS politicsNorth CarolinaHouse of RepresentativesUS CongressDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

As he has sought redress for what he has considered to be unfair reporting about him and his administration, Trump has suggested at least 28 times over the last eight years that a television network should lose its license, according to analysis by the Guardian.But while the FCC does not actually license national networks, it does license the local television stations they own or strike affiliate deals with.What happened at Fox News after the 2020 election? Documents reveal new detailsRead moreAnna M Gomez, the lone Democrat on the FCC, said after a commission meeting last week that Trump’s threats were hollow. “Aside from the ability to make things difficult for those we retaliate, this FCC is powerless to truly retaliate against a news network,” she said, noting that no local station licenses were up for renewal “any time soon”.Here is the full history of Trump’s threats:201711 October 2017Tweet from Trump“Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked. Not fair to public!”11 October 2017Tweet from Trump“With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!”20184 September 2018Tweet from Trump“NBC FAKE NEWS, which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story, is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct. I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?”202018 September 2020Campaign rally in Minnesota“You know, in the old days, when you used public airwaves free, you had to get a license. I keep saying if they’re reporting fake news, how come they can keep getting a license? Whether it’s ABC, whether it’s NBC, CBS, or of course CNN, which is, I mean, it’s one of the great jokes of all time: CNN or MSDNC.”202416 January 2024Campaign rally in New Hampshire“Last night, NBC and CNN refused to air my victory speech. Think of it, because they are crooked, they’re dishonest, and frankly, they should have their licenses or whatever they have taken away.”11 September 2024Interview with Fox & Friends“I think ABC took a big hit last night. I mean, to be honest, they’re a news organization. They have to be licensed to do it. They ought to take away their license for the way they did that.”12 September 2024Truth Social post“… I felt that also, but no Politician should ever do a Debate with ABC News. They have proven NOT WORTHY, and hopefully an investigation will be done as to whether or not they gave the Debate questions to Comrade Kamala, whose best friend is a top ABC Executive. If she did give the questions to Kamala, ABC’s license should be TERMINATED. Remember, Donna Brazile works for ABC, and she gave the questions to Hillary Clinton!”10 October 2024Truth Social post“60 Minutes is a major part of the News Organization of CBS, which has just created the Greatest Fraud in Broadcast History. CBS should lose its license, and it should be bid out to the Highest Bidder, as should all other Broadcast Licenses, because they are just as corrupt as CBS – and maybe even WORSE!”10 October 2024Truth Social post“A giant Fake News Scam by CBS & 60 Minutes. Her REAL ANSWER WAS CRAZY, OR DUMB, so they actually REPLACED it with another answer in order to save her or, at least, make her look better. A FAKE NEWS SCAM, which is totally illegal. TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE. …”10 October 2024Truth Social post“CBS should lose their license. You know they have a license – they have a license which is worth billions of dollars, and they pay nothing. All of these networks are all crooked as hell. You saw that with ABC.”11 October 2024Campaign rally in Nevada“60 Minutes should be taken off the air for what they’ve done. You know what else? They should lose their license. They have licenses, these networks. They’re worth billions of dollars, but the one thing is it says you have to be honest. That’s election interference. They’re interfering with the election. Am I right? They should lose their license, and 60 Minutes should be taken off the air.”12 October 2024Interview with Newsmax host Chris Salcedo“They pay nothing.

They pay nothing. They’re public airways, they pay nothing.

We’ll see … They should lose their license, which is worth billions of dollars.”1 November 2024Campaign rally in Wisconsin“What 60 Minutes did and CBS, I think the license should be taken away from CBS. And I think that 60 Minutes should be forced to either close or take a very extended stay.”2 November 2024Interview with Fox & Friends Weekend“On behalf of the people, we sued 60 Minutes and CBS. And we think their license should be taken away. I think it’s the greatest breach. I think it’s the greatest insult to the American citizens.”20256 February 2025Truth Social post“… CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable ‘NEWS’ show should be immediately terminated …”13 April 2025Truth Social post“… I am so honored to be suing 60 Minutes, CBS Fake News, and Paramount, over their fraudulent, beyond recognition, reporting. They did everything possible to illegally elect Kamala, including completely and corruptly changing major answers to Interview questions, but it just didn’t work for them. They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing. They should lose their license! Hopefully, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as headed by its Highly Respected Chairman, Brendan Carr, will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior. CBS is out of control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”24 August 2025Truth Social post“Why is it that ABC and NBC FAKE NEWS, two of the absolute worst and most biased networks anywhere in the World, aren’t paying Millions of Dollars a year in LICENSE FEES. They should lose their Licenses for their unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives, but at a minimum, they should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime!!! Crooked ‘journalism’ should not be rewarded, it should be terminated!!!”18 September 2025During comments to reporters on Air Force One“I read someplace that the networks were 97% against me. I get 97% negative, and yet I won it easily. I won all seven swing states, popular vote, I won everything. And they’re 97% against, they give me only bad publicity. I mean, they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It would be up to Brendan Carr.”5 October 2025Truth Social post“… This is just one of the many reasons that the Federal Communications Commission should look into the license of NBC, which shows almost exclusively positive Democrat content. Likewise, ABC Fake News – About the same thing, 97 percent negative to Republicans!”18 November 2025During bilateral meeting with Mohammed bin Salman“I think the license should be taken away from ABC because your news is so fake and it’s so wrong. And we have a great commissioner, the chairman, who should look at that because I think when you come in and when you’re 97% negative to Trump, and then Trump wins the election in a landslide, that means obviously your news is not credible and you’re not credible as a reporter.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS televisionUS television industryTelevision industryABCtimelinesShareReuse this content"

The OBR said the threshold freeze would bring an additional 780,000 people into paying the basic rate of income tax; 920,000 into paying the higher rate; and another 4,000 would pay the additional rate.Budget 2025: key points at a glanceRead moreIn a series of well-trailed measures, the chancellor targeted the rich via a new council tax surcharge for properties worth more than £2m and announced a 2p tax increase on income from dividends, savings and property. Contributions to “salary sacrifice” pension schemes, on which employers pay no national insurance, will be capped at £2,000 from 2029 – bringing in a significant £4.7bn a year.Reeves later told journalists that she did not believe she had broken the Labour manifesto with the threshold freeze. “If you read the manifesto, we are very clear, we say ‘the rates of income tax, NI and VAT’, but if you are asking does this have a cost for working people, I acknowledge it does,” she said.The OBR said the tax squeeze would hit living standards, with real disposable household income scheduled to rise by just 0.25% a year over the forecast period – weaker than it expected in March..Financial markets responded positively as Reeves more than doubled the financial buffer she has left against her fiscal rules to £21.7bn, from less than £10bn in her spring statement.Yields on 10-year government bonds, or gilts, which move in the opposite direction to prices, were down 0.07 percentage points at 4.41% by late on Wednesday, lowering the cost of government borrowing..Labour MPs hailed the chancellor’s decision to spend £3bn a year on scrapping the controversial two-child benefit limit in full, a move the government said would lift 450,000 children out of poverty.“I don’t intend to preside over a status quo that punishes children for the circumstances of their birth,” the chancellor said to cheers from the Labour backbenches.Reeves also promised to bear down on inflation with a package of cost-of-living measures, including removing green subsidies from household energy bills and freezing rail fares.Levies on energy bills will now be paid out of general taxation, which the Treasury said could reduce bills by an average of £150 a year from next April.Labour MPs and ministers praised the budget as a shift leftwards – saying it had bought Keir Starmer and Reeves time from a much-rumoured leadership challenge.“This shows we are a full-blooded Labour government. In an ideal world we would have wanted welfare to come first but we are where we are. People want us to make an argument – so this is one. Wealthiest pay more and we protect those with greatest need,” one senior strategist said.But several others said the OBR showed the fundamental weakness in the economy remained – and that the deep reservations about Starmer’s leadership would not be calmed by this budget. “This does nothing to move the fundamentals,” one minister said. “Yet again there was an opportunity for boldness which has led to nothing much.”Another minister said: “This buys them a few months with backbenches and bond markets and it further cements hatred with my voters. But it delays the now inevitable reckoning.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was responding to weaker economic forecasts from the OBR, which now expects average GDP growth of 1.5% over the next five years – 0.3% slower than previously expected..Alongside the threshold freeze and the mansion tax, other revenue raisers announced by Reeves included a £1.1bn increase in tax on online gambling and a 3p-a-mile levy on electric vehicles. Rishi Sunak’s 5p cut to fuel duty was extended to next summer, but it will start to rise from next September.Gilt yields began falling even before Reeves stood up in the House of Commons, as traders digested the OBR’s budget document, mistakenly published on the watchdog’s website about 40 minutes before she was due to begin speaking.Jonas Goltermann, the deputy chief markets economist at CapitalEconomics, said: “The gilt market is breathing a sigh of relief after the much-anticipated UK budget announcement today delivered less bad news than feared and the chancellor appears to have, so far, come out of a fraught fiscal process a bit stronger.”Some analysts highlightedthe heavily backloaded natureof Reeves’s plans, however, with borrowing set to be higher over the next three years, and the bulk of the tax rises scheduled for the end of the parliament, to ensure she can meet her fiscal rule of covering day-to-day spending with taxes..“To bear down on borrowing in later years and deliver that increase in ‘headroom’, the chancellor is relying heavily on tax rises towards the back end of the parliament,” said Helen Miller, the director of theInstitute for Fiscal Studies(IFS). “More borrowing for the next few years, then a sharp adjustment. Spend now, pay later.“It’s one thing to promise a reduction in borrowing, and another to actually deliver it.”Ruth Curtice, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, welcomed the moves on cutting the cost of living but echoed the IFS’s caution. “This budget leaves much of the fiscal repair job to 2028 and beyond. Economic winds could change dramatically between now and then. The chancellor has taken the sensible step to increase her wiggle room at the start of the parliament but the effects will be felt at the end,” she said.Reeves addressed MPs in parliament on Wednesday night warning them that they would see a negative response on the newspaper front pages – but telling them it was up to them to sell the budget to voters.“Now, we’ve got to win the argument, and we’ve got to win the argument every single day. We have to win the argument for the budget. We’ve got to campaign on the budget – and that is what we must now do,” she said.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, dismissed Reeves’ statement as a “Benefits Street budget,” accusing her of “making ordinary people pay for her incompetence and her inability to face down Labour’s tax-hungry leftwing backbenchers”.Soft-left MPs said it was a victory for those who had spent time since the welfare rebellion pushing the party leftwards. The revived Tribune group of MPs, likely to be a vehicle for any future leadership battle for a leftwing candidate, praised the chancellor, calling it a “Labour budget, demonstrating Labour values”.But in a warning shot it said the budget should be “the start of a wider programme of modernisation. Future tax reforms must aim for simplicity, sustainability, and fairness – ensuring that hard work is rewarded, unearned income and wealth are taxed more consistently, and those with the broadest shoulders should continue to contribute proportionately to national renewal.”Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025Rachel ReevesOffice for Budget ResponsibilityBenefitsEnergy billsPublic financeUS Government borrowingnewsShareReuse this content"

It has about 56,000 employees.“As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,” said the California company’s chief executive, Enrique Lores.He said teams working on product development, internal operations and customer support would be affected by the job cuts. He added that this would lead to $1bn (£749m) savings a year by 2028, although the cuts would cost an estimated $650m.News of the job cuts came as a leading educational research charity warned thatup to 3m low-skilled jobs could disappear in the UKby 2035 because of automation and AI. The jobs most at risk are those in occupations such as trades, machine operations and administrative roles, the National Foundation for Educational Research said.In the US, about 40% of jobs could be replaced by AI, in sectors ranging from education and healthcare to business and legal, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute released this week.AI agents and robots could automate more than half of US work hours using technology that is available today, the US consultancy’s analysis found. It estimated that $2.9tn of economic value could be unlocked in the US by 2030.Most roles at risk are in legal and administrative services, with tasks such as data entry, financial processing and drafting documents likely to be handled by AI systems, although people will still be needed to design, supervise and verify. Dangerous, physical jobs such as machine operation could be replaced by robots.HP had already cut between 1,000 and 2,000 staff in February as part of a restructuring plan.It is the latest in a run of companies to cite AI when announcing cuts to workforce numbers. Last week the law firm Clifford Chance revealed it wasreducingbusiness services staff at its London base by 10% – about 50 roles – attributing the change partly to the adoption of the new technology.The head of PwC also publicly cut back on plans to hire 100,000 people between 2021 and 2026, saying “the world is different” and AI had changed its hiring needs.Klarna said last week that AI-related savings had helped the buy now, pay later companyalmost halve its workforce over the past three yearsthrough natural attrition, with departing staff replaced by technology rather than by new staff members, hinting at further role reductions to come.Several US technology companies have announced job reductions in recent months as consumer spending cooled amid higher prices and a government shutdown.Executives across industries are hoping to use AI to speed up software development and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build advanced AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to an increase in memory costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Demand for AI-enabled PCs continues to increase, and they made up more than 30% of HP’s shipments in the fourth quarter to 31 October.However, it forecast between $2.90 and $3.20 in adjusted net earnings per share for the coming year, below analysts’ forecasts of $3.33. It said the outlook reflected added costs from US trade tariffs.HP shares fell as much as 6% after announcing the job cuts.Explore more on these topicsHewlett-PackardTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

The worst run in 71 years. By a team that coasted to the Premier League title last season and were then supposedly upgraded to the tune of almost £450m. Unbelievable, as Arne Slot would say. HisLiverpoolare stuck in reverse and his position could be under serious threat unless a way out is found soon.PSV Eindhoven were the latest beneficiaries of woeful Liverpool defending and aimless attacking play as the Dutch side inflicted a comprehensive defeat on Slot’s team.Arne Slot’s woes deepen as awful Liverpool are thrashed by PSV at AnfieldRead moreLiverpool have endured three consecutive losses by a three-goal margin (or more) for the first time since December 1953. These nine defeats in a dozen games represent the club’s worst run since that 1953‑54 season, when Liverpool were last relegated, and the latest was the club’s joint‑heaviest home loss in Europe.But it is not only statistics that condemn Slot and his players following the defeat by a composed and clinical PSV side. It was the despondent body language that followed Couhaib Driouech’s late brace for the Eredivisie champions, PSV’s third and fourth goals of the night, and the sight of fans heading for the exits – for a second game in succession – long before the final whistle. Jürgen Klopp spoke of turning doubters into believers on his first day as Liverpool manager. Believers are becoming doubters again, with Slot unable to find solutions to the freefall. There were songs of support around Anfield after the final whistle but also audible boos. The man who won the title in his debut season in English football only seven months ago is losing the confidence of the Kop.Virgil van Dijk and Slot had demanded a reaction from the side’s alarming 3-0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest on Saturday. It appeared fitfully. Not conceding first must have been on Slot’s list of corrections for Liverpool’s sorry run of results, but that is precisely what happened as his captain gifted PSV an early breakthrough.Peter Bosz’s assured visitors made a confident start. From their second corner in quick succession, delivered by Joey Veerman, Van Dijk handled high above his head to concede a clear penalty. The Spanish referee, Alejandro Hernández, was unmoved by Van Dijk’s claims that he had been pushed in the back by his Netherlands defensive colleague Jerdy Schouten. So, too, was the video assistant referee. The veteran Croatian midfielder Ivan Perisic sent the penalty the opposite way to the Liverpool goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who was deputising for the ill Alisson. It was the worst possible start for a side under pressure. And it meant Slot’s team had conceded first in 10 of their past 12 outings. Ridiculous.View image in fullscreenArne Slot has seen his team lose their past three matches by three-goal margins.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAUnlike Forest, however, when Van Dijk admitted that panic kicked in, Liverpool did respond positively to falling behind. As they should; there were only six minutes on the clock after all. Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo combined to create an equaliser 10 minutes later. Gakpo, receiving the midfielder’s pass on the left, cut across Sergino Dest and forced Matej Kovar into a low save. The PSV keeper could only push the ball back into the danger zone where Dominik Szoboszlai slotted into an unguarded net.The PSV defender Yarek Gasiorowski had a goal disallowed for offside shortly afterwards following a wild foul by Van Dijk on Ismael Saibari. The Liverpool defender was possibly still fuming over the penalty decision. His mood was not helped when he headed a Mohamed Salah corner against the PSV crossbar.Liverpool ended the first half strongly but PSV rediscovered their composure after the restart, much to the annoyance of the home crowd who saw their team outplayed for long periods. Liverpool’s defending also added to Anfield’s sense of unease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Guus Til read the delivery perfectly and, arriving ahead of Milos Kerkez, beat the Liverpool keeper with a first‑time shot from close range. Slot’s woes deepened when Hugo Ekitiké hobbled off injured and was replaced by Alexander Isak.Konaté’s performance had been an improvement on the low bar of Saturday but a dreadful error from the Liverpool centre-half invited PSV to extend their advantage. The France international completely missed what should have been a routine clearance to allow Ricardo Pepi, on as a substitute, to advance through on goal. Pepi cut inside Van Dijk and squeezed a low shot against the base of a post. Couhaib Driouech, also on as a substitute, followed in to beat Mamardashvili from the rebound.Konaté was soon replaced for a striker, as he was against Forest, with Slot having to take more risks to chase the game. The end result was the same with Liverpool exposed and Driouech finding the bottom corner following an incisive PSV counter attack in stoppage time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueLiverpoolPSV Eindhovenmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

An absorbing game that ebbed and flowed throughout had Bayern Munich’s rising teenager Lennart Karl cancel out Jurrien Timber’s opening goal from a corner before substitutes Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli sealed a deserved win for the home side. It maintains their 100% record in theChampions Leagueand sends them top of the table.Harry Kane let it slip in the buildup that scoring against Arsenal gives him “a bit more joy” than any other club. But the England striker with 27 goals for his club to his name this season barely had a sniff as aBayern Munichside that had also won their first four matches in the Champions League group stage and had been unbeaten in 21 previous games this season were taught a lesson. A place in the knockout stages now seems a mere formality.Arsenal 3-1 Bayern Munich: Champions League – live reactionRead moreWhile it was a night to forget for Myles Lewis-Skelly on a rare start as he was given a severe test by 17-year-old Karl and Leandro Trossard limped off injured before half-time, the return of captain Martin Ødegaard from a knee injury that has kept him out for a month was another reason for Mikel Arteta to be cheerful.With every week that passes,Arsenallook more like a winning team and perhaps their manager’s pre-game remark that they remain “in a different universe” to the six-time European champions Bayern, having yet to win this competition, could be consigned to history if they can keep this up.A Premier League showdown with second-placed Chelsea on Sunday will be a further test of their credentials, but at the moment they are passing every test.“We’ve certainly been very, very consistent in the competition. But it’s just the beginning,” said Arteta. “The energy we created in the stadium, what the team transmits, the energy that we bring, the quality we play with. It’s incredible and we have to maintain that because it’s still very early.”Bayern’s gameplan seemed to try to take the sting out of a boisterous home crowd still on a high fromSunday’s evisceration of Tottenham. They dominated possession in the opening 20 minutes as Arsenal were restricted to two attempts from set-pieces that were both flagged offside. There was to be no such reprieve when Timber leaped highest at the near post to head in Bukayo Saka’s corner.Kane admitted grudgingly beforehand that Arsenal have capitalised on the recent proliferation of goals from set-pieces, but Bayern’s defenders were incredibly slow to react as the Dutchman creeped in front of Manuel Neuer to apply the finishing touch.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Jurriën Timber heads home to open the scoring against Bayern.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe goal galvanised Arsenal as the outstanding Declan Rice and Martin Zubimendi began to take control in midfield. Bayern were pushed back deeper and one stray pass from Kane was met with hearty jeers.But after Eberechi Eze could not quite get his shot away after exchanging passes with Mikel Merino, Bayern responded with a sucker punch. A raking ball from the back by Joshua Kimmich picked out the run of Serge Gnabry and his touch was perfect for the diminutive Karl – who became Bayern’s youngest goalscorer in this competition last month and has been tipped for a call-up for Germany’s World Cup squad by the former captain Lothar Matthaus –to fire into the net first time.Arsenal seemed shellshocked and they could have found themselves behind had Josip Stanisic not dragged his shot wide when Lewis-Skelly was again caught out of position.There was more bad news for Arsenal when Trossard had to limp off just before the break after receiving treatment. The Belgium forward headed straight down the tunnel and was replaced by Madueke. “He said he felt something, we didn’t want to take any risk,” said Arteta.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We get to show how we react now.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke (centre) scored Arsenal’s second goal from Riccardo Calafiori’s excellent cross.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianMerino was inches wide of the target with another header from a corner before Kompany was shown a yellow card for protesting when Dayot Upamecano took out Madueke. The pressure was building.Somehow Saka did not react quickly enough when Neuer saved with his foot to deny a rampaging Rice and an open goal went begging. It took an error from Upamecano to finally restore their lead as he gave the ball straight to Rice and Riccardo Calafiori’s first involvement after coming off the bench was to set up his fellow substitute Madueke for a tap-in.Bayern pressed forward in search of an equaliser. Eze’s long ball caught out Neuer on the halfway line and a clever touch from Martinelli with his thigh to take the ball away from the Bayern goalkeeper set up a simple finish and underline that Arsenal definitely means business this time.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueArsenalBayern Munichmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There were measures of encouragement for the crucial Premier League home game against Fulham on Saturday, most notably in the shape of Randal Kolo Muani, the striker who is on loan fromParis Saint-Germain.Kolo Muani set up Richarlison for 1-0 and scored with a stinging volley for 2-1. There would be another for him before this wildChampions Leaguetie was over. They were his first in Spurs colours, a reminder to his parent club about his quality. After his move to PSG from Eintracht Frankfurt in 2023 for an initial €75m, he endured a difficult 18 months.Arsenal go top as Martinelli puts finishing touch to win against Bayern MunichRead moreThere was nevertheless frustration for Thomas Frank and his Spurs players, namely in how they allowed the initiative to slip, silly errors proving their undoing. Well, that and a guy called Vitinha. PSG’s ludicrously talented midfield controller was the star, finishing with a hat-trick.Vitinha produced a pair of equalisers with long-range shots, the first a real jaw-dropper just before half-time, and it was him that set the seal on it all from the penalty spot. It added up to a fourth win out of five in the competition for the holders, even if there was an unwanted footnote in the shape of a stoppage-time red card for the substitute, Theo Hernández. He cleaned out the former PSG player, Xavi Simons, with an elbow. Simons had come on as a replacement.Spurs competed, as Frank had demanded. They grew into the game as an attacking force, which was positive. It was just an irritation that they could not keep the back door bolted. Some of their defending was loose, to say the least, as they fell to a first defeat of the Champions League campaign.All eyes had been on how Spurs lined up. Would Frank stick with a back five, one of the moves that had played so badly against Arsenal? The answer was no. He loaded his starting XI with four central midfielders and arranged them in a diamond at the outset, Archie Gray at the tip behind Kolo Muani and Richarlison.It was another new setup from Frank, although flexibility was the watchword, Gray dropping deep out of possession, Lucas Bergvall pushing up when he could on the left. It felt significant that Frank’s No 1 midfielder, João Palhinha, started among the substitutes. Ditto the No 1 attacker, Mohammed Kudus. Did Frank have one eye on Fulham?Vitinha was in the mood, wowing with the sharpness of his turns, the range of his passing. There was a deftness to his floated ball on 21 minutes that picked out the run of Warren Zaïre-Emery in behind the Spurs backline. The finish was confused.Moments earlier, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia had banged past the far post from distance but Spurs were comfortable in the first half. Frank’s midfielders brought the energy, the hard running and there was evidence that Spurs wanted to get up the pitch.The breakthrough was such a tonic for Spurs – just as Vitinha’s equaliser was a sickener, especially in terms of the timing. It was Bergvall who ignited the move for 1-0 with a lovely flick for Gray, allowing him to cross from the left. Up went Kolo Muani, unmarked beyond the far post, and his header gave Richarlison the relatively simple task of nodding home his sixth of the season from close range. Kolo Muani was unaffected by having to wear a mask to protect his broken jaw.Vitinha’s first was a beauty, yet another illustration of his technical brilliance. When PSG worked a corner short, the 18-year-old striker, Quentin Ndjantou – on his full Champions League debut – rolled square along the edge of the box. It was inviting. Vitinha unloaded first time with his right foot, the ball crashing in off the underside of the crossbar.Spurs went back in front at the start of the second half, Kolo Muani returning a dramatic goalline clearance from Willian Pacho with interest, the connection on the volley so pure. The chance had been created when Richarlison headed Pedro ­Porro’s deep corner back inside for Gray to hook goalwards. Pacho thought he had saved the day. He had not.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Inevitably, it was Vitinha, who cut on to his left foot to shape a curler into the far corner. Luis Enrique would get his fit again Ballon d’Or winner, Ousmane Dembélé, on as a substitute towards the end. Frank said Vitinha would win the next Ballon d’Or.Spurs cracked. The concessions for numbers three and four were grisly, self-inflicted wounds to the fore. Pape Sarr was robbed by Hernández after Spurs had tried to play out from the back, Cristian Romero putting his teammate into trouble. Seconds later, Fabián Ruiz had swept home. And how did Spurs not clear the corner for No 4? Sarr looked as though he had to do so but he could not. Pacho made him pay.Kolo Muani’s goal for 4-3 was another clean finish after Rodrigo Bentancur had done the unthinkable and dispossessed Vitinha.Frank was happy, saying he saw character and aggression in his team; a soul. But it was fitting that Vitinha completed the scoring. Romero leapt in to block a shot from him, doing so with a hand.

Instead it inspired a fashion revolutionRead moreThe Lakers’ fifth consecutive victory got heated late in the fourth quarter when Dunn knocked Dončić to the court with a check to the back. Dončić got up and confronted Dunn, who shoved the ball into his chest. Hayes responded with a two-handed shove of Dunn, who attempted to retaliate with a swat at Hayes’s head while officials and teammates separated them. Hayes will get a fine for his technical foul, but it won’t cost him any money.“I got him,” Dončić said. “I told him right away, thanks for having my back. This is what I love about this team. Everybody has got each other’s back.”Dončić and Dunn have skirmished several times in the recent past.They were given technical fouls for a vocal run-in when Dončić’s Dallas Mavericks faced Dunn’s Utah Jazz in December 2023. Dončić stared Dunn off the court when Dunn was ejected from a Clippers-Mavericks game in December 2024, and Dunn appeared to injure Dončić with a trip from behind when the Lakers faced the Clippers last March. The latest confrontation ended with Dunn’s ejection for two technical fouls.“I was waiting for a rebound, and I got a shot in my back,” Dončić said. “I’m not going to just stand it. I ain’t afraid of nobody. I’m not going to just stand there and let it go ... That’s what the game is about. Sometimes it’s going to get physical. There’s a lot of trash-talking. I live for that, so I love it.”The game was played on the Lakers’ yellow version of the special courts deployed across the league forNBA Cupgames – but Dončić didn’t feel safe.“Adjust the courts, please,” Dončić said after praising the format of the tournament, now in its third year. “It’s just slippery. It’s dangerous ... I slipped a lot of times. You could see a lot of players slipped. That’s dangerous, man.”The game was the Lakers’ first Cup game at home this season after starting group play with two road games. Dončić said he couldn’t remember whether the courts in New Orleans and Memphis were more slippery than normal.“I think they’re just new courts, so it’s kind of tough,” Dončić said. “It needs ... playing some games.”Complaints about the special courts are not new. Boston star Jaylen Brown said he injured his groin while playing on the Toronto Raptors’NBACup court in 2023, and other players have weighed in on the dangers of playing on unworn hardwood.LeBron James said he saw “a couple of guys” struggling on the court Tuesday, but didn’t personally find it dangerous.The Lakers clinched their group and earned a spot in the NBA Cup quarter-finals with their victory. That’s exciting to Dončić, who understands the concept of Cup competitions in a way his North American teammates often do not.“I think I never got past the group stage, so it’s something new for me,” Dončić said. “I played it in Spain, something like this, so I like it.”When told he had earned at least $53,000 with the Lakers’ group win, Donçić, who has $198m in career earnings, grinned.“Obviously, I’ll accept money,” Dončić laughed.Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićNBALos Angeles LakersLos Angeles ClippersBasketballUS sportsNBA CupnewsShareReuse this content"

Described by the Milano-Cortina 2026 chief executive, Andrea Varnier, as “the symbol of our Paralympic Games”, he admits the conversion has also been considered as an act of “blasphemy” by some traditionalists.The Paralympics are coming to LA. But has the US done enough to guarantee success?Read more“The decision to stage the opening ceremony in the Arena di Verona is not just an aesthetic one although, of course, we like to showcase such a beauty,” Varnier said. “But it was also an idea, to make the arena accessible and not only the arena itself but the entire route from the railway station to the venue.“Now they’re going to build an elevator, which for the purists of classic monuments, this is a blasphemy to build an elevator in a Roman amphitheatre. But now that will be there. And we think it’s part of things that change. It’s also a very strong message.”Varnier said the refurbishment of the arena, which has cost €20m (£17.5m), will form a central plank of the Games’ legacy alongside an expansion of accessible public transport, and funding for education and training of winter para‑sports. He hopes these actions will help to facilitate the growth of winter para‑sports in what he admitted is a “challenging” environment.In another initiative, one that will apply to both the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games, Varnier has pledged that the “critical” process of artificial snow manufacturing will be conducted without the use of chemicals. “We know that with climate change, snowmaking becomes critical,” he said. “But a new system we have put in place means we can use water without harming the local ecosystem and the new machinery for snowmaking uses only water. No chemicals are added in any of our snowmaking technologies. So it’s real snow, even if it’s artificially made.”View image in fullscreenThe Olympic and Paralympic signs in Cortina d'Ampezzo.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockThe Winter Paralympics will feature athletes from 50 countries competing in six para-events: alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, ice hockey, snowboard and wheelchair curling. Varnier would not disclose the number of tickets sold for the Games but admitted there was work to be done.“[Spectators] are now focused on the Winter Olympic Games and this is a bit unfortunate because we would love to see [ticket sales] going really in parallel,” he said. “Unfortunately, it’s always like this and we were not able to disrupt this pattern. So we still need to trigger the ticket sales but again we are very confident because we are exactly in the same position as our colleagues were in Paris, so it’s normal.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSport in FocusFree weekly newsletterOur picture editors select their favourite sporting images from the past week, from the spectacular to the powerful, and with a little bit of fun thrown inEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He argued that the Games should be viewed as layering another “small brick” in the growth of the Paralympic movement.“To grow winter sports is more challenging and we know that,” he said. “We know that the complex environment makes it more challenging.

Today, Graham Ruthven endeavors to answer three of themGraham RuthvenWed 26 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 06.09 ESTShareCould Arne Slot’s job be at risk?This time last season,Liverpoolhad just registered their 10th win in 12 games to go nine points clear at the top of the Premier League. It was around this time the narrative around Slot’s team shifted from questioning if they could win the title in their first season post-Jürgen Klopp to predicting just how far ahead of the chasing pack they would finish. A year on, the narrative has shifted tremendously.Saturday’s 3-0 loss to Nottingham Forest was Liverpool’s sixth in their last seven league games. Now 11 points behind Arsenal and top spot, their title defence is already as good as over with Champions League qualification also looking a long way out of reach. Only a few months back, Liverpool were widely judged to have ‘won’ the summer transfer window. That seems a very long time ago.On paper, Liverpool’s team is still the strongest in the Premier League. They have last season’s top scorer (Mohamed Salah). And one of the best goalkeepers in the world (Alisson). And arguably the best centre-back of the Premier League era (Virgil van Dijk). Oh, and they added Germany’s most talented playmaker in a generation (Florian Wirtz), as well as a striker (Alexander Isak) so good he has beencompared to Thierry Henry. They all played against Forest, and Liverpool lost handily.In the absence of a clear explanation, the finger of blame is starting to bend towards Slot. The Dutchman was wise not to overhaul the winning team he inherited from his predecessor last season. Now, though, he is struggling badly to impose his own ideas and identity on a team that has lost the muscle memory from the Klopp era.Fenway Sports Group are known for their calculated approach to most things. Nothing that’s happening right now, however, was planned for. Liverpool are probably still a long way from seriously considering Slot’s position, but the longer their slide continues, the greater their desperation will grow.How would Trinity Rodman’s NWSL exit change women’s soccer in the US?IfSunday’s NWSL finalwas Trinity Rodman’s final match in the league, she could have done more to leave a lasting impression. Limited to a cameo appearance off the bench as she ramps up from an injury-hit season, the US international was powerless to stop the Washington Spirit suffering a 1-0 loss to Gotham FC. Rodman was quiet. By her own admission, she “definitely underperformed.”View image in fullscreenTrinity Rodman is set to be out of contract and will be in-demand.Photograph: Justine Willard/APRodman could be forgiven for not being entirely focused. The 23-year-old is the subject of intense speculation about her future with several European clubs reportedly interested. There’s also an offer on the table from DC Power of the Gainbridge Super League that is “significantly larger” than the Spirit’s offer, according to the Athletic.A move to the USL’s Division 1 would completely reshape the hierarchy of women’s soccer in the United States. It would be a David Beckham or Lionel Messi-esque moment for the new disruptor league. Even if Rodman leaves for Europe, as many other American stars have in recent times, questions will be asked of theNWSLand its standing at the top of the women’s game.Is the NWSL’s salary cap model sustainable in the face of increased competition for the biggest names? Rodman is at the forefront of a new American generation. There’s a Women’s World Cup in 2027, which the US will be expected to win. Rodman may well be the face of that tournament. Could the NWSL alter its structure, doing away with its salary cap or raising it considerably, to keep her and other stars of her ilk? The Rodman Rule, to follow MLS’s Beckham Rule that gave way to Designated Players? The league’s future could hinge on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s onthe President of the United States’ social media accounts.

It will seat 62,000 fans, feature 12 chimney-like towers inspired by the city’s industrial heritage and be named The Powerhouse. The only thing missing is a giant sign reading ‘“by order of the Peaky Blinders.”No other stadium in the world will look like this one, and that should be applauded. It’s refreshing to see a club want something other than a soulless glass bowl to call home. If The Powerhouse looks anything like the renderings that were released it will be instantly recognisable to fans everywhere.It will also be tacky. The world’s first AI stadium in real life. A theme park attraction disguised as a soccer stadium. Wagner insists the finished article will look like the cartoonish images released last week, quipping “we’re spending a lot of time and money on a stadium that will never be built.” They must have saved a fortune using ChatGPT instead of an architect to design it.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolUSA women's football teamUS sportsBirmingham CityNWSLWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Cowell will take on a new role as chief strategy officer.View image in fullscreenFernando Alonso’s Aston Martin before the Las Vegas Grand Prix.Photograph: Daniel Cole/ReutersNewey said: “Over the last nine months, I have seen great individual talent within our team. I’m looking forward to taking on this additional role as we put ourselves in the best possible position to compete in 2026, where we will face an entirely new position with Aston Martin now a works team combined with the considerable challenge faced by the new regulations.“Andy’s new role, focusing on the integration of the new PU with our three key partners, will be pivotal in this journey.”Newey has played a significant role in 13 drivers’ world championships and a dozen constructors’ titles with three different teams but has never previously held the role of team principal. He ended a near two-decade association with Red Bull before committing to Aston Martin – where he is also a shareholder – in a major coup for the billionaire owner Lawrence Stroll.Aston Martin stand a disappointing eighth of 10 teams in the constructors’ standings with two races to go but Stroll believes these changes will put them in the best place before next season’s substantial regulation changes.Stroll added: “Andy Cowell has been a great leader this year. He’s focused on building a world-class team and getting them to work well together, as well as fostering a culture that puts the race car back at the heart of what we do.“I’m also pleased that Adrian Newey will step into the team principal role, which will enable him to make full use of his creative and technical expertise.

Sodden and frozen, he trudges off a pitch at Manchester United’s Carrington training base, gesticulating and muttering a goalkeeper-eyed analysis of the game his team have just lost. “We got pumped,” he says loudly, his annoyance clear.Sometimes the obvious question must be asked: even on days such as this, does Heaton still enjoy it? “I love it,” is his response, his near‑permanent grin reappearing.Everton brush off bizarre Gueye red card to beat lethargic Manchester UnitedRead moreThat short assessment makes sense of everything: why a goalkeeper would grind despite minimal chance of game time; why a man with three England caps, who turns 40 in April, still does what he does, day in, day out; and why the trope of the third-choice keeper being a lazy freeloader is so wrong.Heaton’s last league appearance came for Aston Villa on 1 January 2020. He injured knee ligaments that day, rejoined United in July 2021 and has since played 202 minutes. His last competitive first-team outing came 1,029 days ago. Yet starting games is still at the forefront of his mind.“The feeling doesn’t leave you,” he says. “I’m still trying to get that shirt, so in that sense game days can be difficult sat up in the stands, doing the warm-ups with the lads and then getting changed again to play that supporting role.”Heaton surely knew what he signed up for in returning to the club he joined as an 11-year-old. He had left United in 2010 without making an appearance and came back when David de Gea was first choice and Dean Henderson a regular in England squads.“My outlook can sometimes be bordering on deluded,” he says with a smile. “I understand the optics of it, but I thought: ‘I’m going to take that on.’ The logical side of my brain knew that coming back here at 35 was probably more to fill this role. But I have zero regrets. I’ve loved being here.”Heaton no longer has expectations of his name appearing when the team is announced. Is there disappointment? “There has been at times but it wouldn’t be right to say that at the moment.”View image in fullscreenTom Heaton moves the ball during a training session at Carrington.Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesThere have also been times when moves have been mooted. Luton were a possibility, and he spent the day with Rob Edwards before the club’s Premier League season in 2023-24. United turned down the bid. Last summer, before he re-signed at United, Wrexham, where Heaton started his youth career, were another possibility.Discussions with a sports psychologist bring some “closure” and he quotes the Chinese proverb “chop wood and carry water”. But his real comfort comes from “closer to home”. Every day of his career, Heaton has spoken to his dad before and after training. “It sounds a bit heavy but it has always been my everyday protocol. He was a PE teacher, like my mum, and also did a bit of psychometric testing so he’s relatively good with psychology … I don’t think he’ll mind me saying that!”Returning to United was also an opportunity to close the circle. “There is so much of my personal history tied up in it,” he says, adding that his two young sons are part of United’s emerging talent squad. Heaton is often back at Carrington with them in the evening, using the opportunity to do extra recovery sessions. “The chance to come back, be part of it, and try to get the club back to being a success was too good to turn down.”Heaton’s United debut finally came as a substitute in December 2021 in the Champions League against Young Boys at the age of 35. In his first spell he shadowed goalkeepers such as Edwin van der Sar and was in the travelling party forthe 2008 Champions League final victory against Chelsea. Having to watch that from the stands after warming up was the moment he knew he needed to leave, albeit it was two further seasons before he departed for Cardiff when his contract expired.View image in fullscreenTom Heaton in the thick of the action against Charlton in January 2023. His most recent senior appearance came the following month.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images“It was the right decision for me,” he says, before breaking off to wave at a passerby. Almost everyone at Carrington gets a similar greeting. “Sir Alex [Ferguson] was forceful with me when I first said it to him but I’ll never forget that a few weeks later he had me back in the office to say that he understood the decision, respected it and would always be there for me.”Heaton is one of few remaining in Carrington’s shiny new buildings who experienced the Ferguson era. He is, in a sense, a touchstone of the club’s not-too-distant glory years, someone who understands United’s culture and values. Take the day’s training, for example. It is an international break so a gaggle of youngsters are brought in to work with the first team. Heaton knows each by name. In part, it is because he is details-oriented, but it is more because “if you’re training with the Manchester United first team, it’s right that everyone knows your name … we’re going to have expectations of you but at the same time we should be valuing everyone”. He says “the behaviours, the mentalities, the attitudes” he learned from Ferguson and others at United “stick with you through life”.Heaton’s day begins at home with a 20-minute stint in the garden with his younger son. By 9am he and Harry Maguire are regularly setting the world to rights over breakfast. As swiftly as one can gobble up an egg-white omelette with peppers, they solved, at least in their own heads, several global pharmaceutical issues.Once strapped up, Heaton heads to the gym. Ruben Amorim’s goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, is an innovator, and Heaton completes several unusual exercises. One involves catching while wearing glasses designed to impair vision, another standing facing a white wall, one hand over an eye, with Craig Mawson, also a goalkeeper coach, feeding tennis balls over his shoulder.To his left is the Batak reaction wall, with the club believing Heaton to be an unofficial world record-holder. “He set it about a decade ago and no one saw it,” Dermot Mee, the fourth goalkeeper in United’s setup, chips in. There is, apparently, video evidence.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The club believe he is an unofficial world record-holder.Photograph: MUFCOutside, as the warm-up continues, there are light moments punctuating intense drills. Suddenly a whistle shrieks. The goalkeepers are needed with the outfield players and from that point Heaton is on. Properly on.“The desire to win in training was something to behold,” he says of his first spell at United, namechecking Roy Keane, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes. “I really have tried to take that with me wherever I’ve gone.”The consensus is that Heaton represents technical perfection, but he has his quirks. He tries to keep his finger weights regime under wraps and “could see the gaffer looking at me very strangely yesterday during a break in training when I was diving towards the top corner to save an imaginary ball. I’m a believer in doing anything that I think has some benefit to it. It comes from being secure in yourself and I’m OK with it.”Heaton, who has made 301 appearances in the top two flights of English football, helps to coach the 18-year-old academy keeper Cameron Byrne-Hughes through the day’s session and is enjoying workingwith Senne Lammens. “He’s assured in what he is and who he is,” he says.Heaton, naturally, has half an eye on what comes next. He has his A and B licence outfield coaching badges and the Uefa certificate in football management. This year he obtained a distinction in a sporting director course and he has studied executive leadership at Oxford University.View image in fullscreenReflecting on standards during the Ferguson era, Tom Heaton says: ‘The desire to win in training was something to behold.’Photograph: Ash Donelon/Manchester United/Getty ImagesAmorim has made him part of United’s leadership group and he had a similar role under Erik ten Hag. Amorim held a “pivotal” pre-season meeting where he explained the concept to the players and gave the group licence to assert themselves. “That was important as you can set these things up but they need to have that influence,” Heaton says.The group meets regularly to discuss individuals, situations unfolding, any required interventions and praiseworthy actions. “When you’re in a competitive, alpha-male environment, it doesn’t matter if you’re 15 or 40, you’re fighting for respect,” Heaton says. “That’s easier when you are performing and delivering. I’ve only made a few appearances so those opportunities have been limited. But it was a nice challenge for me – how am I going to put myself in a position where I’ve got enough credit and respect to exert some influence?“That was about building good relationships, but also doing things properly … if you do things properly, people respect it.”Eight years after Roy Hodgson took Heaton to Euro 2016, Gareth Southgate had enough respect for the playerto want him as a 27th man at Euro 2024. Heaton was a quasi-training player and a coach, bridging the gap between staff and squad. “The only downside is that I made the error of coming back after five weeks away from my wife and boys, and called it the best five weeks of my life. That went down like a lead balloon as you might imagine. Playing has always been the biggest driver for me, but that was probably a real eye-opener – I thoroughly enjoyed that trip.”This article was updated on Wednesday 26 November to amend an erroneous reference to Gareth Southgate having been England manager at Euro 2016Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedinterviewsShareReuse this content"

I am OK with my position. It is not the first time I’ve been in a difficult position but it is about time that we turned it around.”Asked to elaborate on his conversations with the Liverpool hierarchy, the head coach said: “We talk a lot. They are helpful to the team and to me and we have those conversations but they don’t call me every single minute of the day to say they trust me. In the normal conversations we have I feel the trust. But I haven’t spoken to them after this game yet so let’s see.”Slot lamented familiar failings from his Liverpool side in their Champions League defeat, namely missed opportunities and conceding too easily, but the midfielder Curtis Jones was more forthright in his assessment of the club’s predicament.Jones said: “I don’t have the answers. Honestly, I don’t. I’m saying that to everybody. It’s just unacceptable. I don’t even have to wait to think about it. I’m past being angry inside. I’m at the point now where I just don’t have the words. It’s hard because I’m playing for the team I support. I’m a fan, and I’ve seen this club all my life. In a long, long time, I haven’t experienced a Liverpool team going through a period like this with results like these.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the landmark case has highlighted the risks to footballers of environmental exposure to banned substances and opened up the possibility of further controversies emerging around the thousands of synthetic pitches across Europe.The spectre of a doping violation had not been on anyone’s minds when Vålerenga faced LSK Kvinner at LSK-Hall in Lillestrøm, near Oslo, on 22 April. But a routine drug test found four players from each side had returned samples containing the prohibited substance 1,3-dimethylbutylamine (DMBA). One of the samples, belonging to the Vålerenga player in question, exceeded the Wada reporting threshold of 50 ng/ml.Quick GuideHow do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?ShowDownload the Guardian app from the iOS App Store on iPhone or the Google Play store on Android by searching for 'The Guardian'.If you already have the Guardian app, make sure you’re on the most recent version.In the Guardian app, tap the Profile settings button at the top right, then select Notifications.Turn on sport notifications.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It triggered an investigation that baffled officials from both clubs and Adno, which found no common denominators in food, drink or other supplements consumed by the athletes involved. The affected player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, told the Guardian of the anxiety brought on by learning she was accused of a violation. “It was a terrible moment,” she said. “It was a very upsetting experience and I couldn’t really understand what was going on.”The player was allowed to continue her career while the inquiry continued. She believes the shadow it cast may have affected some of her performances and was deeply relieved when an environmental investigation, which concluded in July, finally discovered the unusual cause.It determined, after testing water samples and substances from multiple sites within the hall, that the shredded tyre granulate – known popularly as rubber crumb – on the pitch had contained the DMBA, which had been transferred to the players during the game. DMBA is a synthetic substance that stimulates the central nervous system and is sometimes used in dietary supplements, although it is banned in Norway and the European Union. It was known, through peer-reviewed scientific studies, to be a product that can occur through breakdown of the rubber-type granulate and there is a degree of frustration that this was not picked up on during the investigation.The player was found to have borne no fault or negligence in the first known case in elite sport where environmental exposure has been responsible for a perceived violation. “I’ve always known I did nothing wrong and I’m grateful to Adno for tracing the source to LSK-Hallen,” she said.“Still, the process and outcome feel somewhat arbitrary. If Adno had not been able to identify the granulate as the source, my situation would have been much more difficult. When you’re extremely careful, follow all the rules and still end up being drawn into a case like this, it shows how vulnerable you are as an athlete.”The surfaces are not deemed to pose a health risk to athletes but concerns have been raised in the past about their role in microplastics pollution. From 2031, rubber crumb infill will be barred from sale in the EU. After the Vålerenga case emerged, the Norwegian Football Federation recommended that indoor competitive matches be moved outdoors. There are about 1,800 such synthetic pitches in Norway and they are also prevalent in the UK, particularly at grassroots level. No international standard exists to ensure turf materials are free of substances banned in sport.Vålerenga want the rules to be bolstered to acknowledge a positive doping test is not always traceable to an athlete’s action, advertent or otherwise. Global rules are based on “strict liability”. Those are expanded upon in article 2.1 of Wada’s anti-doping code, which reads: “It is not necessary that intent, fault, negligence or knowing use on the athlete’s part be demonstrated in order to establish an anti-doping violation.”Harriet Rudd, the Vålerenga CEO, told the Guardian: “Environmental factors really need to be high on the radar moving forward. It’s about having a holistic overview of what in the environment you risk finding in a doping test. Anti-doping work has to develop and issues like this have to become a much larger part of the things you take into consideration.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 23-year-old has trained with the squad this week and may be ready to play some part against Arsenal.It is unlikely that Enzo Maresca would throw Palmer in from the start against the Premier League leaders. Chelsea have coped well during the England international’s absence, recording 10 wins from 13 games. The jibe that Chelsea, who are second but six points behindArsenal, are Cole Palmer FC no longer sticks.Estêvão’s delight at ‘perfect night’ after Chelsea teenager helps see off BarcelonaRead moreChelsea added quality to their squad last summer and have ensured that Maresca has a range of options in attack. The head coach has responded well and produced another tactical masterclass against Barça. Chelsea were inspired by Maresca’s decision to start Estêvão Willian on the right-wing. The 18-year-oldBrazil winger stole the showwith a majestic solo goal.The focus has been on keeping expectations realistic after the win. Chelsea do not want players or staff to get carried away. They are aware that it will betougher against Arsenal, who will present Maresca’s talented young side with a much harder physical test.Belief will rise if Palmer is in the matchday squad. The former Manchester City player has had a frustrating season. His groin has troubled him for a while but there is hope that a period of rest has resolved the issue. Palmer will be looking to make up for lost time, especially as he is keen to ensure that he is in contention for a place in England’s World Cup squad.Explore more on these topicsChelseaArsenalnewsShareReuse this content"

Uefa had hoped to sell one package of first-pick games to a global streaming company, yet that did not materialise.Instead, Amazon Prime retained its first-pick packages in the UK, Germany and Italy – via separate auctions – and Canal+ and Movistar got all the matches in France and Spain respectively. “The global deal is the dog that didn’t bark,” François Godard, a senior media analyst for Enders Analysis, says. “The big tech firms clearly weren’t that interested. Sport is not going global.”Sources involved in the process say the global tender launched in October attracted significant interest from Netflix, Apple TV and Dazn, but that the traditional model of selling rights to individual markets proved more lucrative.The combined value of the UK deal (which includes Sky Sports’ return to European football by buying every Europa League and Conference League game) increased from £1.2bn to £2.2bn, albeit over four years rather than three. Germany’s rights rose by 40% a year, Italy’s by 30% (both fuelled by Paramount’s emergence) and Spain’s by 14%, with only France of Europe’s big five TV markets failing to increase. Canal+ retained the rights on similar terms, although given thecollapse in the value of Ligue 1 rightsthat was not a terrible result for Uefa.Godard says it points to other rights holders continuing with a market-by-market sales approach. Recent trends are mixed, with Fifa selling global rights to Dazn for the Club World Cup this year but Apple TV and Major League Soccer agreeing this month to terminate their 10-year global deal three years early.The Premier League’s plan to open an in-house media company next season has led to speculation it could launch a PremFlix channel for its next rights cycle beginning in 2029. The main lesson of the Uefa auction, however, appears to be thatdemand for global or even pan-European deals has been overstated.View image in fullscreenThere has been speculation that the Premier League could launch a PremFlix channel for its next rights cycle.Photograph: Daniela Porcelli/SPP/Shutterstock“I don’t know if Uefa received any global bids, but if they did there was clearly more value in selling market by market,” Godard says. “It’s pure mathematics. The indications are that we will continue with the current model for some time, selling rights market by market, and cycle by cycle. The Uefa rights cycles aren’t even aligned, with Europe starting new contracts in 2027 and the US locked in until 2030.”Had one streaming partner bought all the first-pick rights it would have had to show the same match across its markets. Amazon, having won three auctions, has the option to select different games for the UK, Germany and Italy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s also little evidence of fans wanting to watch teams from outside their own countries, until the quarter-finals at least.“The simultaneous European auction increased values. After Paramount won in the UK, other broadcasters appear to have raised their bids in the other four markets, which all went to a second round.”In the UK the biggest winner, beyond Paramount, appears to have been Sky Sports: its key domestic rival, TNT, was significantly weakened and Sky picked up 342 European matches relatively cheaply. The Europa League increasingly features big English clubs with a good chance of reaching the latter stages. Manchester United and Tottenhamcontested last year’s final, whileChelsea won the Conference League. It also helps that Celtic and Rangers regularly feature.Sky will also benefit from Paramount’s emergence, Godard says, because it will be forced to make the Champions League available on the Sky platform. Paramount+ is available free to Sky Cinema subscribers, and further bundling appears inevitable. “Paramount is already a slave to Sky,” Godard says. “Without bundling there will be an even greater loss of viewers to piracy. TNT had the Champions League for 12 years [initially as BT Sport] and were just about breaking even, so it’s very tough for new entrants to the market. And the more fragmentation the better for Sky, as the other channels need to be on their platform.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueUefaSports rightsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The 29-year-old former Harlequin has 26 England caps and has signed a long-term deal from 2026-27 and will now be eligible again for international duty.At the launch of the 2025-26 Champions Cup, Tuilagi was asked about potential involvement in the World Cup afterSamoa emerged victorious from the qualifyingtournament in Dubai earlier this month.Tuilagi’s most recent cap came at the end of last year’s Six Nations, shortly before his switch from Sale to Bayonne, a move that in effect ended his England career. He would be available for selection by Samoa, should he choose to play, three years after his final England appearance.“When Samoa qualified it was all over social media,” Tuilagi said of the speculation. “It’s still a long way away and I don’t know if I’ll be able to make it.”Asked if he would be interested, Tuilagi said: “It’s different between being interested and being able to compete. It’s a World Cup, not a club competition. If you want to go, you’ve go to make sure you go there to compete, not just for the craic.”Pressed further, he added: “For me interest is one thing, being realistic in how you perform is a different thing. We’ll see.”After signing for Sale on Wednesday, Marchant said: “When I spoke to [Sale director of rugby] Alex Sanderson he explained the direction he wants to take the club and the ambition he has. It’s a club that wants to win trophies and I’d love to be a part of that.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was initially launched in response to a Treasury proposal to “harmonise” the duty paid on betting and gaming at a single rate.Online betting firms to pay billions more in UK tax, Reeves confirmsRead moreInstead, the chancellor opted for a new regime on gambling duty with a focus on online games of chance, which are associated with significantly higher rates of gambling-related harm than single-event betting. Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), the tax paid on profits from online slots and casino games, will almost double, from 21% to 40%. While the tax rate for online betting on sports other than racing will rise from 15% to 25%, there is no change to the rate on machine gaming or sports betting in high-street shops.“I would like to commend the chancellor and the government for listening to the concerns of British racing and offering their clear support for our sport,” Lord Allen said , “[and] thank everyone who has played their part across the sport, standing as one to communicate our message.“The government has rightly recognised that we are not only a vital part of the fabric of the British way of life, but we are also a global leader and one of the country’s most important soft power levers. We want to maintain Britain’s place on the world stage.”Martin Cruddace, the chief executive of Arena Racing Company (Arc) and a key figure in the “Axe The Racing Tax” campaign, said the sport had “been clear throughout that harmonisation of tax rates of British racing and other betting and gaming products would gravely impact our industry”.He added: “As a sport and industry, we continue to offer a real contribution to this country, supporting communities and culture. I am so glad the government has recognised that fact and helped put our sport on a path to growth.”The new gambling duty regime is closely aligned to proposals put forward by the Social Market Foundation (SMF) thinktank in July. It also follows an intervention in the debate in August by the former prime minister Gordon Brown, calling fora significant rise in online gaming duty.View image in fullscreenRachel Reeves announced in Wednesday’s budget that the rate of duty for betting on horse racing will remain unchanged at 15%.Photograph: House of Commons“This decision mirrors the proposals made in our recent SMF report on gambling tax,” said Dr James Noyes, one of the authors of the report. “We are pleased the government has decided to differentiate between different types of gambling product – increasing the duty on more harmful remote casino content while protecting horse racing from the planned rise in betting duty.“For too long, the online gambling industry has been undertaxed. This decision by the chancellor will ensure that operators pay their fair share and brings the UK into line with international best practice.”Gambling operators’ profits on racing bets are subject to an additional 10% deduction to fund the Levy. The decision to increase the rate of duty on non-racing bets, effectively aligning these with racing bets at a total deduction of 25%, will be expected to increase the sport’s attractiveness as a product for online operators.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Thursday tipsShowUttoxeter:12.25 Merry Monty 12.55 Khrisma 1.30 Double Click 2.05 Holokea 2.40 Fortune Dancer 3.15 Soldier’s Leap.Taunton:12.35 Miss Altea Blue 1.05 Iris Des Issards 1.40 Maximum Offers 2.15 Ellerton 2.50 Bashful Boy 3.22 Begin The Luck 3.52 No Risk Today.Lingfield:12.40 Malago Rose 1.15 Moor End 1.50 Broomfield Aderra 2.25 Noble Park 3.00 Mondo Man 3.33 Defi Nonantais.Newcastle:3.28 Jez Bomb 4.05 Leonetto 4.40 Mythical Bay 5.15 Unassuming 5.45 Henery Hawk 6.15 Uniting 6.45 Secret Guest 7.15 Bungle Bay.Chelmsford:4.30 Accommodation 5.00 Snow Light 5.30 Diamond Ali 6.00 An Bradan Feasa 6.30 Madrigal Moment 7.00 Calafrio (nap) 7.30 Parlando (nb) 8.00 Eliza Bennet 8.30 Stratoc.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The budget statement allocated an additional £26m for the Gambling Commission to combat a possible increase in unlicensed gambling, which has been repeatedly raised by the Betting and Gaming Council, the industry’s main lobbying group, as a potential result of tax rises.“We want to collaborate with our betting operator partners to grow the sport,” Brant Dunshea, the BHA’s acting chief executive, said, “and I’m absolutely convinced that betting operators and racing have a shared interest in doing that and are committed to doing so.“Our sport is often criticised for being fragmented and not joined up.

Our response to these allegations includes difficult facts about Adam’s mental health and life circumstances.“The original complaint included selective portions of his chats that require more context, which we have provided in our response. We have limited the amount of sensitive evidence that we’ve publicly cited in this filing, and submitted the chat transcripts themselves to the court under seal.”The family’s lawyer, Jay Edelson, called OpenAI’s response “disturbing” and said the company “tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, by arguing that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act”.Earlier this month, OpenAI washit by seven further lawsuitsin California courts relating to ChatGPT, including an allegation it acted as a “suicide coach”.A spokesperson for the company said at the time: “This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we’re reviewing the filings to understand the details. We train ChatGPT to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”In August, Open AI said it wasstrengthening the safeguardsin ChatGPT when people engage in long conversations because experience had shown that parts of the model’s safety training might degrade in these situations.“For example, ChatGPT may correctly point to a suicide hotline when someone first mentions intent, but after many messages over a long period of time, it might eventually offer an answer that goes against our safeguards,” it said. “This is exactly the kind of breakdown we are working to prevent.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Although not legally binding, it raises pressure for European legislation amid growing alarm about themental healthrisks to children of unfettered internet access.The European Commission, which is responsible for initiating EU law, is already studying Australia’sworld-first social-media banfor under-16s, which is due to take effect next month.In a speech in September, the commission’s president,Ursula von der Leyen, said she would watch the implementation of Australia’s policy. She spoke out against “algorithms that prey on children’s vulnerabilities with the explicit purpose of creating addictions” and said parents felt powerless against “the tsunami of big tech flooding their homes”.Von der Leyen promised a panel of experts would be set up by the end of the year to advise on the best approach to protecting children.Interest is growing in restricting children’s social media and smartphone access. An expert report commissioned last year by France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said children should not be allowed to use smartphonesuntil the age of 13and social media, such as TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat, until they were 18.Christel Schaldemose, the Danish Social Democrat MEP who drafted the resolution, told reporters that politicians needed to act to protect children: “It is not just parents. Society also needs to step up and make sure that platforms are a safe place for minors to be, but only if they are above a certain age.”Her report called for the default disabling of addictive features on internet platforms when used by minors, such as infinite scrolling (endless content as the user scrolls down), videos that automatically play, excessive push notifications and rewards for repeated use of a site.The resolution noted that “addictive design features are often inherent to the business model of platforms, notably social media”. An earlier draft of the Schaldemose report citeda studystating that one in four children and young people displayed “problematic” or “dysfunctional” smartphone use – behavioural patterns mirroring addiction. The resolution said children should be 16 before they could access social media, although parents could give consent from the age of 13.The White House is urging the EU to roll back its digital laws and some supporters of a social media ban explicitly framed the vote in this context. At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, Howard Lutnick, the US commerce secretary, said EU rules on tech companies needed to be more “balanced” in exchange for lower US steel and aluminium tariffs.Referring to Lutnick’s visit, Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, a French MEP from Macron’s party, said Europe was not “a regulatory colony”. In a statement after the vote, she added: “Our digital laws are not for sale. We will not back down on children’s protections because a foreign billionaire or big tech tells us to.”The EU already seeks to protect internet users from online harms, such as disinformation, cyberbullying and illegal content, via its Digital Services Act. But the resolution said this law had gaps and could do more to protect children from addictive design features and online exploitation, such as financial incentives to become influencers.Schaldemose said the act, which she co-authored, was strong “but we could go further, especially in areas of addictive design features and harmful dark pattern practices where we are not so specific, not so precise”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The councils shut down several computerised systems as a precaution to limit further possible damage.The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham had also reported an attack. Together the three authorities provide services for more than half a million Londoners.RBKC said it had established the cause of the cyber incident on Wednesday but declined to give further details, citing the involvement of the NCA and National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of GCHQ.In 2020 a ransomware attack on Hackney council accessed and encrypted 440,000 files, resulting in a reprimand from the ICO.Engineers at RBKC worked through the night on Monday, when the incident occurred, and Tuesday. Services including checking council tax bills and paying parking fines are likely to be limited at RBKC, which said its website would probably go up and down during Wednesday as security fixes progressed.In astatement, the council said: “We don’t have all the answers yet, as the management of this incident is still ongoing. But we know people will have concerns, so we will be updating residents and partners further over the coming days. At this stage it is too early to say who did this, and why, but we are investigating to see if any data has been compromised – which is standard practice.”It said it and Westminster had been working with specialist cyber-incident experts and the NCSC, “with the focus on protecting systems and data, restoring systems, and maintaining critical services to the public”.The boroughs also share some IT systems with the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. It was not immediately clear to what extent that borough had been affected.RBKC said it had “invoked business continuity and emergency plans to ensure we are still delivering critical services to residents, focusing on supporting the most vulnerable”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We will continue working with our cyber specialists and the NCSC to restore all systems as quickly as possible, and we will be in touch with more information as it becomes available. If there are any further changes to services, we endeavour to keep everyone updated.”The incident, which was spotted on Monday morning, led to concern at other councils. Hackney in east London, which was not affected but saw land searches, housing and planning services affected in 2020, told staff it had “received intelligence that multiple London councils have been targeted by cyber-attacks within the last 24-48 hours, with potential disruption to systems and services”.Rob Miller, a former IT director at Hackney council and now a senior director at the consultancy Public Digital, said: “If you want to impact on people’s lives, councils are a good target.

It has about 56,000 employees.“As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,” said the California company’s chief executive, Enrique Lores.He said teams working on product development, internal operations and customer support would be affected by the job cuts. He added that this would lead to $1bn (£749m) savings a year by 2028, although the cuts would cost an estimated $650m.News of the job cuts came as a leading educational research charity warned thatup to 3m low-skilled jobs could disappear in the UKby 2035 because of automation and AI. The jobs most at risk are those in occupations such as trades, machine operations and administrative roles, the National Foundation for Educational Research said.In the US, about 40% of jobs could be replaced by AI, in sectors ranging from education and healthcare to business and legal, according to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute released this week.AI agents and robots could automate more than half of US work hours using technology that is available today, the US consultancy’s analysis found. It estimated that $2.9tn of economic value could be unlocked in the US by 2030.Most roles at risk are in legal and administrative services, with tasks such as data entry, financial processing and drafting documents likely to be handled by AI systems, although people will still be needed to design, supervise and verify. Dangerous, physical jobs such as machine operation could be replaced by robots.HP had already cut between 1,000 and 2,000 staff in February as part of a restructuring plan.It is the latest in a run of companies to cite AI when announcing cuts to workforce numbers. Last week the law firm Clifford Chance revealed it wasreducingbusiness services staff at its London base by 10% – about 50 roles – attributing the change partly to the adoption of the new technology.The head of PwC also publicly cut back on plans to hire 100,000 people between 2021 and 2026, saying “the world is different” and AI had changed its hiring needs.Klarna said last week that AI-related savings had helped the buy now, pay later companyalmost halve its workforce over the past three yearsthrough natural attrition, with departing staff replaced by technology rather than by new staff members, hinting at further role reductions to come.Several US technology companies have announced job reductions in recent months as consumer spending cooled amid higher prices and a government shutdown.Executives across industries are hoping to use AI to speed up software development and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build advanced AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to an increase in memory costs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Demand for AI-enabled PCs continues to increase, and they made up more than 30% of HP’s shipments in the fourth quarter to 31 October.However, it forecast between $2.90 and $3.20 in adjusted net earnings per share for the coming year, below analysts’ forecasts of $3.33. It said the outlook reflected added costs from US trade tariffs.HP shares fell as much as 6% after announcing the job cuts.Explore more on these topicsHewlett-PackardTechnology sectorArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

Universal remains in litigation with Suno while Sony Music is suing both Suno and Udio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No more tiresome weekly stints of vacuuming, and no more last-minute panic sessions when you have visitors on the way. Instead, your compact robot chum regularly trundles out from its dock, sucking up dust, hair and debris to leave your floors looking spick and span.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Over the past few years, robot vacuums have become much more affordable, with basic units starting at about £150. They’re also doing more than they used to, mopping areas of hard flooring and charging in sophisticated cleaning stations that empty their dust collectors and clean their mop pads for you.In fact, the biggest effort required by you is deciding which one to buy. That’s where I can help. I’ve tested nine of the most popular models to help you find the best robot vacuum for your space.The best cordless vacuum cleaners for a spotless home: 10 tried and tested favouritesRead moreAt a glanceBestrobot vacuum cleaner overall:Eufy X10 Pro Omni£699 at EufyBest robot vacuum for power cleaning:Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+£1,169.10 at AmazonBest robot vacuum cleaner for small homes and small budgets:Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart£156.40 at AmazonBest for hard floors and open-plan homes:Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra£999 at AmazonWhy you should trust meI’ve spent almost three decades reviewing technology, home and garden products, covering everything from PCs, printers and tablets to lawnmowers, coffee machines,steam cleanersand fans. I’ve tested a wide range of smart-home appliances and devices, and I know the features that make them more effective and easier to use – and those that don’t bring any real value.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I spilled flour and crunched cereal on a mat to up the challenge for the robot vacuum cleaners’: the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ takes on the mess.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianOur team scoured the stores and spoke to manufacturers to pull in the leading robot vacuum cleaners. I then gave our test subjects the workout of their little robot lives in my three-bedroom, two-floor home. Over three weeks I had them cleaning every room, switching vacuums and docks around to give each a shot at the upstairs and downstairs spaces.The house has a mix of wooden and composite hard flooring, rugs and carpets, with various awkward, dusty corners as well as two cats shedding inconceivable quantities of hair. What’s more, the living room is a fiendish obstacle course, with two sofas, a packed TV cabinet, an Ikea Poäng armchair and a vintage suspended egg chair to navigate. Even with some lighter furnishing removed, these robot vacuums had their work cut out.I used a smartphone sound meter to measure noise levels, and a plug-in power meter to see how much energy the docks or chargers used while idle and when charging. I also spilled flour and crunched cereal on to a barrier mat to check the suction and cleaning power of each model, treading in the crumbled shredded wheat to up the challenge. I used the apps to check the vacuums’ mapping and scheduling capabilities and to add rooms, zones and no-go areas.After testing, the cleaners were either returned to their sources or donated to the British Heart Foundation.The best robot vacuums for 2025View image in fullscreen‘The absolute master of mopping’: the Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianBest robot vacuum cleaner overall:Eufy X10 Pro OmniEufyX10 Pro Omnifrom£499£699 at Eufy£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperb, hassle-free vacuuming and moppingWhat we don’t loveBig and noisy, especially when mop cleaningThe prices below reflect current Black Friday offers£699 at Eufy£499 at AmazonThe X10 Pro Omni is not a bad price for a self-emptying, self-cleaning robot mop and vacuum. The base station washes and dries the heads between uses, refilling the internal water tank and emptying the dust collector. It uses a front-facing camera and laser technology to sense its way around your floors, spotting and identifying items, such as socks or cables, that it can then avoid. It’s powerful, with 8,000Pa of suction force, and its twin rotating mop heads can apply 1kg of downwards pressure, to give your hard floors a serious scrubbing when they need it.Why we love itThis Eufy machine does almost everything for you, as long as you periodically empty the base station’s dust bag and dirty-water tank and refill the clean-water tank. Like the Samsung, reviewed further down, it’s great at mapping out your home and dodging potential obstacles, but it’s also better than the Samsung at cleaning on the first pass. The side brush and vacuum can shift dust and hair in seconds, while the mop left my hard floors sparkling, even dealing with dried-on spots of juice.The Eufy X10 Pro Omni takes on the mess, before (left) and right (right).Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianThe app gives you plenty of control, allowing you to set up cleaning scenarios to focus on different areas. You can also tweak cleaning options such as suction power if, say, you’ve got a deep pile carpet to clean and you don’t think it’s really making an impact. The brush and roller seem particularly resistant to getting clogged with hair.It’s a shame that …mopping isn’t so effective on the low water setting – switching up to medium will get you better results. It’s also bigger and louder than rivals, struggling to fit under low furniture and hitting 68dB on max power. Cleaning and drying the mop can be a long and noisy process.Suction power:8,000PaRobotdimensions:327 x 353 x 114mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:365 x 480 x 360mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:3hrsPower consumption (charging):26.4WEufyX10 Pro Omnifrom£499£699 at Eufy£499 at AmazonWhat we loveSuperb, hassle-free vacuuming and moppingWhat we don’t loveBig and noisy, especially when mop cleaningBest robot vacuum for power cleaning:Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+SamsungBespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+from£1169.10£1299 at Samsung£1169.10 at AmazonWhat we loveBrilliant at navigation; strong and speedy cleaningWhat we don’t loveHuge base station; struggles with rugs£1,299 at Samsung£1,169.10 at AmazonIt’s hard to miss Samsung’s robot mop and vacuum cleaner, not least because its white base station is more of a mansion than a house, standing over half a metre tall. It’s also unnervingly speedy and has a habit of playing jingles when it starts or finishes, or on any event in between.It uses a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner and two 3D cameras to navigate your home, and it features twin rotating mop heads, which attach magnetically to the bottom of the unit. These are steam-cleaned and dried when the robot returns home.Why we love itIt’s a strong all-rounder. It doesn’t have as much suction as the mighty Dyson, reviewed below, but makes up for it by hunting hair, dust and debris relentlessly until it’s gone. The rotating mop heads do a fantastic job of removing marks and stains from kitchen floors, and they lift up when not in use to avoid rubbing on the carpet.Before (right) and after (left) the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ tackled flour and crunched up cereal on a mat.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianIt’s also great at navigation, picking up and even identifying potential obstacles, before carefully manoeuvring around them. Even my troublesome egg chair didn’t cause this machine any issues. With the dock’s integrated dust bin and water tanks, it’s also no great effort to maintain.It’s a shame that …the base station is enormous, and this model is among the most expensive on test. It also struggles with rugs more than the other top vacuums, regularly pulling up the edges and creating a rumpled mess that it subsequently had trouble traversing.Suction power:6,000PaRobotdimensions:359 x 364 x 100mm (WDH)Dockdimensions:444 x 510 x 547mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:68dBABattery life:3hrsPower consumption (charging):45.8WSamsungBespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+from£1169.10£1299 at Samsung£1169.10 at AmazonWhat we loveBrilliant at navigation; strong and speedy cleaningWhat we don’t loveHuge base station; struggles with rugsBest robot vacuum cleaner for small homes and small budgets:Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmartBekoVRR61414VB RoboSmartfrom£156.40£184 at Currys£156.40 at AmazonWhat we loveCheap, compact and effectiveWhat we don’t loveBefuddled by long hair; needs regular emptying£184 at Currys£156.40 at AmazonShort of space? Beko’s compact cleaner doesn’t need much: it’s just 34cm across and 8cm high, with a small, simple dock for charging. There’s no mop and not a huge amount of suction power, but it uses laser tech to map out and make its way around your rooms, automatically detecting rugs and carpets then boosting up the suction power. It’ll also get into nooks and under low furniture that halts bigger robot vacuums in their tracks.Why we love itIt’s relatively tiny and inexpensive, but don’t dismiss the Beko as a toy. Thanks to chunky wheels and ingenious suspension, it’ll make its way over tricky rugs and thresholds without any worries, and its rotating side brush has enough oomph to compensate for a meagre 2,000Pa of suction.While it’s not the best vacuum for deep cleaning, it’s great at heading out daily to keep dust under control. Battery life isn’t epic, but two hours should be more than enough for the two floors of the average home, and it can always head back to its dock and start again later. It’s also quiet, putting out 60-61dB even at maximum power.The mat before (left) and after (right) the Beko VRR61414VB RoboSmart did its thing.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianIt’s a shame that …long hair can bind itself around the side brush and roller, and it struggled to shift all the flour in the spot-cleaning test. You’ll also need to empty the internal dust collector yourself – although it has a large capacity, the vacuum works better if you do so after every session.Suction power:2,000PaRobotdimensions:342 x 342 x 800mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:154 x 146 x 90mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:61dBABattery life:2hrs 10minsPower consumption (charging):13.2WBekoVRR61414VB RoboSmartfrom£156.40£184 at Currys£156.40 at AmazonWhat we loveCheap, compact and effectiveWhat we don’t loveBefuddled by long hair; needs regular emptyingBest for hard floors and open-plan homes:Dreame Matrix 10 UltraDreameMatrix 10 Ultrafrom£999£999 at Very£999 at AmazonWhat we loveAwesome mopping, self-emptying and cleaningWhat we don’t lovePrefers open-plan layouts, hates awkward furniture£999 at Very£999 at AmazonThe Matrix 10 Ultra rivals the Samsung for the skyscraper size of its base station, but in this case the bulk serves a purpose. As well as the dust collector and tanks for clean and dirty water, it packs in three different sets of mop heads and reservoirs for three different detergents. The idea is that it can tell wooden floors from kitchen floors or bathroom floors and apply the right combo of mops and detergents for the job. Plus, when it encounters deep pile carpets, it can leave all the mops behind and focus on its vacuuming.Why we love itDreame’s robot vacuum is the absolute master of mopping. Parquet floors get the light touch; tiles and vinyl get a serious scrubbing; and every hard surface is left gleaming, without soggy rugs and puddles everywhere you look. It’s also a dab hand at vacuuming, with one brush on an articulated arm to sweep hair and debris from the edges of the room into the Dreame’s hungry rollers. There’s enough suction power here to deal with long hair or pet hair, even when it’s worked its way into your carpet.The before (left) and after demonstrate the Dreame Matrix 10 Ultra’s power in our tests.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianYou’ll need to keep the clean water tank topped up and the dirty tank emptied, but the Matrix 10 Ultra otherwise takes care of itself. It empties the internal dust box into a waiting bag when it returns to base for charging, where it will also clean and switch mop heads when it needs to. The heat treatment seems extremely effective at keeping everything grime- and odour-free.Dreame’s app is also extremely comprehensive, giving you plenty of control over its maps, so you can separate them into zones and apply different rules for cleaning. It’s also pretty nimble when it comes to rugs, thresholds and minor changes of elevation, though it still can’t handle proper steps.It’s a shame that …it’s better at navigating single-floor, open-plan spaces than multiple floors. You can move it to a different floor and set it to work, but it often needs to return to the base station for emptying or cleaning, and it can get confused and do nothing if it can’t locate its home. While it’s thorough, it also struggled to work its way around the low or awkward furniture in my living room.Suction power:30,000PaRobotdimensions:351 x 350 x 89mm (WDH)Dock dimensions:457 x 416 x 589mm (WDH)Maximum noise level:70dBABattery life:4hrs 20minsPower consumption (charging):38WDreameMatrix 10 Ultrafrom£999£999 at Very£999 at AmazonWhat we loveAwesome mopping, self-emptying and cleaningWhat we don’t lovePrefers open-plan layouts, hates awkward furnitureThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘One of the most compact base stations for charging and emptying we’ve seen’: the Eureka E20 Plus.Photograph: Stuart Andrews/The GuardianDyson 360 Vis NavDyson360 Vis Navfrom£599£649.99 at Argos£599 at AmazonWhat we loveSuper-powered vacuuming; smart suction controlWhat we don’t loveExpensive and not thorough enough£649.99 at Argos£599 at AmazonBest for:powerDyson’s robot vac is the most powerful I’ve tested, dragging dirt and long hair out of carpet more effectively than any other model.

The app gives you plenty of control over areas and cleaning, with the ability to set up virtual walls or no-go zones. It’s also smart enough to do some ad hoc cleaning if you drop it in a room it hasn’t seen before.It didn’t make the final cut because…while we loved the bagless convenience – and it did almost make the cut – vacuuming was patchy in places, and its mopping capabilities are basic. Some of our floors got quite a soaking without shifting all the stains and marks. It’s great value and good for homes with moulting mogs and dogs, but not quite up there with our robot vacuum heroes.Suction power:8,000Pa;robotdimensions:350 x 350 x 97mm (WDH);dock dimensions:251 x 180 x 443mm (WDH);maximum noise level:83dBA;battery life:3hrs;power consumption (charging):55WEurekaE20 Plusfrom£371.13£499 at AO£371.13 at AmazonWhat we loveBagless dust collector; good for pet hairWhat we don’t lovePatchy vacuuming and soggy moppingWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreenMost robot vacuums will easily make it around one floor of an average-sized home without a recharge.Photograph: diego_cervo/Getty ImagesRobot vacuums fit into two categories: those that just vacuum, and those that mop as well. My advice would be to focus on the vacuum part, and on the ability to suck up dirt and grime. The mopping is good enough to remove surface spills and superficial marks, but it won’t replace yoursteam cleaneror manual mop. What’s more, some of the less flexible mop mechanisms can leave you with a soggy carpet as the robot vacuum makes its way around your floor.Cleaning powerSuction power counts, and most manufacturers will specify the maximum suction force for each cleaner in Pascals (Pa) – or air watts (AW) in Dyson’s case. However, it’s not the whole story. Different cleaners will use different combinations of rollers and rotating brushes to whisk dirt and dust off the ground and into the vacuum intake.Some are also noticeably better than others at cleaning near the edges of a room and adjusting their suction power to match the levels of dust with which they have to deal. Most robot vacuums can do multiple passes if they need to, but this obviously adds to the cleaning time.Navigation and emptyingThe second key factor is navigation. Robot vacuums use a mix of optical and laser sensors and physical bumpers to make their way around the room, moving past obstacles and making sure they cover every area. More advanced models feature 3D cameras that map the room, giving them a clearer idea of the geography and their exact position within it. Either way, navigation skills vary dramatically, with some cleaners prone to getting lost or confused under your furniture.Vertical navigation skills are just as important, as robot vacuums will probably have to make their way over rugs and low-lying thresholds. Some of the more limber models can push, flip and clamber their way over impediments, while others just get tangled up.Robot vacuums don’t have much space onboard for their dust collector, so they need more regular emptying than the average cordless vacuum. The pricier models work around this by having a larger dust collector or bag in the base station or dock, so that when your robot vacuum puts itself to bed for a recharge, the dock will automatically empty the dust collector and, where necessary, clean the mop head and refill the water tank.Battery life and appsBattery life isn’t a huge deal with modern robot vacuums. Most will easily make it around one floor or more of an average-sized home without a recharge, and they automatically return to base if they’re caught short. However, a larger battery and a more efficient motor can be helpful if you have a bigger space to keep in shape.Onboard controls can be useful when you just want to clean an area quickly, but you’ll spend most of your time managing your robot vacuum from a smartphone app. At the very least, these should have features to customise any room maps, adding zones that need more thorough cleaning and no-go areas where you don’t want the robot vacuum to get stuck.Scheduling features are also very welcome, allowing you to set times when you want your plucky robot to put itself to work. And accessible controls, to change the settings or run quieter at night, can make your new friend even easier to live with.Can robot vacuums clean multiple rooms at a time?They can, though the way this works can vary from model to model. Most robot vacuums navigate and map a whole floor at a time. Once that’s done, you can use the app to label different rooms and then send your robot to a given location.Many let you map multiple floors, and you don’t usually need to move the charging station between floors – just carry the unit upstairs or downstairs. If you have any steps between rooms (like I do in my living room), this often needs to be mapped as a separate floor.Even where mapping isn’t supported, you can usually work around it by carrying the robot vacuum into the other space and setting it to clean. It may not clean as efficiently or effectively, but it will navigate the space and get the job done.How do robot vacuums compare to regular vacuum cleaners?As with cordless vacuums, robot vacuums come with a trade-off between size, battery life and suction force. Because they have to trundle around under their own steam for long enough to cover a decent-sized area, this inevitably limits the power of the vacuum motor.Even powerful robot vacuums top out at 65AW (or 6,000 to 8,000Pa), and that’s often in their battery-draining turbo modes. By comparison, some cordless cleaners offer suction levels up to 250AW, and mains-powered vacuums can go even higher.Confusingly, most manufacturers don’t offer the same suction power across their whole range. Irrespective of which model you buy, though, you may still need a manual vacuum cleaner to purge your carpets of pet hair and really stubborn grime.Stuart Andrews is ajournalistwithmore than three decades of experience in computing and consumer tech.

The Xbox 360 arrived on 22 November 2005 in the US and 2 December in the UK, about three months after I got my first job as a junior staff writer on GamesTM magazine. My memories of the night are hazy because a) it was a worryingly long time ago and b) there was a free bar, but I do remember that DJ Yoda played to a tragically deserted dancefloor, and everything was very green. My memories of the console itself, however, and the games I played on it, are still as clear as anXbox Crystal. It is up there withthe greatest consolesever.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In 2001, the first Xbox had muscled in on a scene dominated byJapanese consoles, upsetting the established order (it outsold Nintendo’s GameCube by a couple of million) and dragging console gaming into the online era with Xbox Live, an online multiplayer service that was leagues ahead of what the PlayStation 2 was doing. Nonetheless, the PS2 ended up selling over 150m to the original Xbox’s 25m. The Xbox 360, on the other hand, would sell over 80m, neck and neck with the PlayStation 3 for most of its eight-year life cycle (and well ahead in the US). It turned Xbox from an upstart into a market leader.In a very un-Microsoft way, the Xbox 360 was cool. Its design was interesting, an inwards double curve described by its designers as an “inhale”, with a swappable front faceplate. It had a memorably Y2K startup animation and clean, futuristic menus that brought messaging, friends lists and music. I remember finding Microsoft’s marketing powerfully cringe at the time – witness thisdeveloper video, featuring former Microsoft entertainment boss J Allard and his infamous earring, in which a guy juggles while saying the words “Three symmetric cores”. But, despite that, the machine they built felt modern and exciting. The controller, too, white with its pops of colour, was such a tremendous improvement on the uncomfortably gigantic original Xbox controller that it’s become a design standard. I know people who will still only use wired Xbox 360 pads to play PC games.Powerfully cringe … Microsoft’s Xbox 360 promo video.As the first properly, seamlessly connected console, it brought a lot of things together to form a sense of gamer identity: playing different games online under one unified gamertag; messages and social features, as well as the inspired idea of achievements, which created a personal gaming history via the little challenges you completed in everything you played. (Sony would soon copy this with trophies.) Attaching a number to this, the gamerscore, was devilish genius, encouraging players to compete for ultimately meaningless clout, and creating a powerful incentive for people to stick with the console rather than buying games elsewhere. TheXbox360 was the first console to understand that people stay where their friends are. If you had the choice between buying a game on PS3 or 360, you’d choose 360 because that’s where everyone else was playing.By late 2006, when a complacent Sony released an overpriced and awkward-looking follow-up to the PlayStation 2, the Xbox 360 had already had a year to convert people to its vision for high-definition gaming. People had already built up a collection of games and an online identity that was tied to Xbox. The big third-party game publishers, who found the PS3’s proprietary technology awkward to develop for, had started to prioritise Xbox for multi-platform games. The 360 never cracked Japan, but in the rest of the world it became the default console, an extraordinary thing for Microsoft to achieve considering how comprehensively Sony had dominated the previous two generations with the PlayStation.View image in fullscreenThe weird, monochrome realm of Limbo.Photograph: TriplePointXbox Live Arcade also helped to usher in the modern era of indie games. Between the 90s and the late 00s, publishers and bricks-and-mortar retailers largely controlled which games did and didn’t make it into players’ hands, especially on consoles. In 2008, Xbox Live Arcade started letting people download smaller, cheaper games direct to their consoles – no shop or publisher required. It did for console gaming what Steam would later do on PC, getting players comfortable with the idea of digital distribution. Games released via the arcade includedGeometry Wars, Braid, Limbo, Bastion and, just as importantly, the best-ever digital version of Uno. I remember sinking many, many hours into Oblivion, Mass Effect and BioShock in my late teens, but I also eagerly awaited each new batch of Xbox Live Arcade games.Looking back, the architects of the Xbox 360 really understood how and why people played games, and what they wanted from a next-generation console at the time. They understood how the internet could transform not just multiplayer gaming, but the social experience around games, and the way people found and bought them. This knowledge was apparently lost in a few short years, because when Microsoft announced the Xbox One in 2013, it was an absolute shitshow. By then, Microsoft apparently thought that people wanted to play games while watching sports picture-in-picture, as a mandatory connected camera watched your every move.Microsoft has never again come close to market leadership in video games. A resurgent Sony took all the best lessons from the Xbox 360 and packaged them into the PlayStation 4, and then the Nintendo Switch arrived in 2018 and blew everything else out of the water. With Xbox now in distant third place in the waning console wars, it seems to see its future as aquasi-monopolistic video game subscription service, rather than a hardware maker. Series that defined the 360 era, such as Halo and Gears of War, are now playable on PC and PlayStation. Others, such as Fable, have been languishing for over a decade.The 360 era was an exciting time in games, a period of great change and competition brought about by online gaming. The console market was a lot smaller back then, but also less predictable. There was still room for those “interesting, 7/10” B-games that sometimes proved even more memorable than the blockbusters when free-to-play games were not yet a thing – games were yet to consolidate into the five established mega-franchises that now dominate everything. And, in bringing indie games to console players, it genuinely changed the trajectory of my gaming taste.What to playView image in fullscreenBath your grain … Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.Photograph: Bizarre Creations/SteamWriting about Xbox Live Arcade had me hankering forGeometry Wars: Retro Evolved, the spectacularly compulsive Xbox Live Arcadetop-down shooterthat looks like fireworks and feels like a sensory bath for your brain.

As Nintendo’s moustachioed plumber lords it up from his gilded go-kart, everyone from Crash Bandicoot to Sonic and Garfield has tried – and failed – to skid their way on to the podium. Now with no one left to challenge its karting dominance,Nintendois attempting to beat itself at its own game.The unexpected sequel to a critically panned 2003 GameCube game, Kirby Air Riders has the pink squishball and friends hanging on for dear life to floating race machines. With no Grand Prix to compete in, in the game’s titular mode you choose a track and compete to be the first of six players to cross the finish line, spin-attacking each other and unleashing weapons and special abilities to create cutesy, colourful chaos.You accelerate automatically at all times, commanding the analogue stick to boost around corners, aiming the direction of your drift with a well-timed flick. Air Riders has a surprisingly steep learning curve: ittook me an hour to stop hurtling into walls. But once you’ve learned to let go (of the stick) and start drifting like a pro, it reveals a satisfyingly zen, minimalist approach to competitive racing.Where Sonic’s 2025 kart outing saw him recruit Minecraft’s Steve, VTuber Hatsune Miku and Yakuza’s Kiryu to its ranks, Air Riders has you competing against such legendary characters as a sentient rock, a slime with googly eyes and someone called Chef Kawasaki. Remember Lolo and Lala? … No? Well, they’re here! But where the roster is lacking, the machines give Air Riders surprising variety and depth, letting you swap between enemy-destroying tanks and glide-happy paper aeroplanes.Each track has personality and spectacle, and there’s a strong sense of visual cohesion that was sorely lacking in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds earlier this year. The art style really shines in Air Riders’ story mode, Road Trip. It’s the best single player mode that director Masahiro Sakurai (who also leads Smash Bros) has ever concocted, packed with surreal boss fights, cleverly modified races and oddly high-budget cutscenes, like a dream you might have after gobbling some too much cheese before bedtime.The big multiplayer mode, City Trials, however, is a let-down. A chaotic collision of Battle Royale-esque resource gathering followed by a Mario party-esque mini game showdown, it feels bafflingly pointless: you spend five minutes powering up for a mini game that ends in seconds. The final mode – Top Ride – offers up a simplified version of the main event, in which you race from a bird’s eye view in a Micro Machines-inspired melee. It’s fun, if shallow.What Air Riders lacks in modes, it makes up for in charm. There are a heap of customisation options, allowing you to pimp your ride with unlockable stickers and alternative colour schemes – you can even hang a plushie from your machine like a Kirby-branded Labubu.This is a tightly focused game that reminds me of Nintendo’s fun-first NES-era game design – for better and for worse. It has a sprinkling of Sakurai magic and oodles of visual panache, but at full price it is – like Kirby – a little puffed-up.Kirby Air Riders is out now; £59.99Explore more on these topicsGamesRacing gamesNintendoNintendo Switch 2reviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s time to change thatWed 26 Nov 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 09.21 ESTShareAs the extraordinary Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump andZohran Mamdanishows, there’s a new bellwether in American politics.For years, Ohio played that role. In every election from 1964 to 2016, the state voted for the winning presidential candidate, and every four years journalists would travel there to interview voters in Columbus and Cincinnati, Dayton and Youngstown. But in 2020 Biden won without carrying the state, and today Ohio is deeply red, costing it its bellwether status. Several other states once considered battlegrounds – Iowa, Missouri, and Florida – have also turned firmly Republican.But now a new bellwether has emerged: Queens. This humbleNew Yorkborough contains multitudes. With a population of 2.3 million, it would be the nation’s fifth largest city if it stood alone. And in diversity it is without peer. Nearly half of Queens residents are foreign born. It is about a quarter white, a quarter Latino, nearly a quarter Asian and 17% Black, and 140 languages are spoken there. It’s home to Citi Field and the USTA Tennis Center, LaGuardia and John F Kennedy airports, MoMA PS1 and Aqueduct Racetrack, Archie Bunker of All in the Family and Awkwafina of Nora from Queens.Flushing is home to so many Asians that its downtown is known as the Chinese Times Square. Astoria has one of the largest Greek populations outside of Greece; Jackson Heights is known as “Little Colombia”; Woodside has a “Little Manila”. Jamaica is home to large African American, Caribbean and Central American populations, while Long Island City has become a magnet for the hip and arty. Queens also has New York’s largest Muslim population as well as 150,000 Jews. Overall, it is thoroughly middle and working class – a swath of heartland America set down in pulsating, cosmopolitan New York.Like all other New York boroughs except Staten Island, Queens reliably votes Democratic, but in November 2024 it moved decisively toward Trump. Where Joe Biden in 2020 won Queens by 72% to 27% – a 45-point margin – Kamala Harris in 2024 won it by only 24 points. Trump’s gains were especially large in heavily Latino, Chinese and south Asian neighborhoods.Many of those voting for him were propelled by the rise in disorder that had occurred in the wake of the pandemic and then exacerbated by the sudden influx of migrants. The placement of the migrants in makeshift shelters in residential neighborhoods without adequate support services led to a wave of complaints about crime and loitering as well as resentment over the diversion of resources from longtime residents. As in many other districts, the rise in rents and the cost of groceries contributed to a sense among many that the path to the middle class was becoming increasingly narrow. A political realignment seemed under way.Yet even as Trump was making such inroads, the democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was winning 69% of the vote in her congressional district, which straddles northern Queens and the South Bronx. And, as dissatisfaction with the status quo surged and concerns over affordability mounted, support grew for another young insurgent – Zohran Mamdani.A state assemblyman whose district includes parts of Astoria and Long Island City, Mamdani in the 24 June Democratic primary won support from a mixed salad of leftish young professionals, working-class Latinos, and recently arrived south Asians – all drawn to his bread-and-butter platform of universal childcare, free buses and a rent freeze. Groups like Drum Beats (Desis Rising Up & Moving) canvassed tens of thousands of residents, including a Bangladeshi population that has tripled over the last decade.In the general election, Mamdani got 47.3% of the votes in Queens. “Some of the areas that have been trending towards Trump went for Mamdani,” observed John Mollenkopf, a professor of political science at the Cuny Graduate Center.Trump concurred. “A lot of my voters voted for him,” the president said during his 21 November meeting with Mamdani. The session seemed to seal Queens’s political arrival. For Trump, too, is a product of the borough. He grew up in Jamaica Estates, a leafy upper-middle-class section located about 10 miles from Mamdani’s Astoria home. Both are anti-establishment figures with a knack for understanding and addressing the needs of those with “fingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor, palms calloused from delivery by handlebars, [and] knuckles scarred with kitchen burns”, as Mamdani put it in his victory speech.With Ocasio-Cortez contemplating a run for higher office, Queens is proving an important seedbed for national politics, and New York-based journalists – rather than have to book flights to the midwest – can now hop on the 7 train to Jackson Heights or Flushing.Yet national news organizations have treated the borough like flyover country. The New York Times in particular has been a step behind. Back in the 90s, the paper had a sizable metro section that thoroughly covered the outer boroughs and the tristate region. But as the Times mushroomed into a global paper – it now has more readers in California than in New York – it has shortchanged the city’s blue-collar precincts. Today, driverless cars in San Francisco get as much coverage in the paper as taxi drivers in Corona.As a result, the Times, during the mayoral race, failed to grasp the groundswell developing behind Mamdani. And, when his strength did become evident, it was strangely dismissive and even hostile toward him, sniffing in an editorial that because of his lack of experience and concern about the disorder in the city, “we do not believe that Mr. Mamdani deserves a spot on New Yorkers’ ballots.”It followed with an “exposé” about how as a high school senior Mamdani (who was born in Uganda) had checked multiple boxes on his college application to Columbia about his race, purportedly to gain an advantage. Mamdani explained that he considered himself “an American who was born in Africa” and that his answers were an attempt to represent his complex background given the limited choices before him. The piece fed the perception that the Times was “on a crusade against Mamdani”, as Margaret Sullivan put it in the Guardian.After his victory, the paper, noting his ascension and Ocasio-Cortez’s continuing strength, ran a piece about how Queens “is having its moment”. With the borough claiming three of the top four spots in a survey of city-neighborhoods-to-watch in 2025; with Astoria emerging as a favorite among young professionals; and with the Rockaways becoming a summer staple, the Times observed, “Could Queens become the new Brooklyn?”It already is the new Ohio.Michael Massing is an American writer based in New York City.

It was what I can only describe as a kind of corporeal attack, an existential clutch followed by days of such powerful anxiety my body was taken in bouts of uncontrollable shaking. A sense of not mattering, a virulent dread and dissolving into an all-encompassing nothingness impossible to shake. How many times as a child, after being abused by my father, had I experienced this sense of erasure and disappearance?Feeling that no matter what I did, what I accomplished, how hard I tried to lift my head above the parapet I would be cast out forever. This attack lasted days. Perhaps it was Virginia’s story, parts of which felt much like my own. Raped as a child by her father, then raped by her father’s good friend, then raped when she ran away, then the years of being raped byGhislaine MaxwellandJeffrey Epstein, then being sexually trafficked to powerful and sadistic men to be raped again.Perhaps it was knowing that after years of working, educating the public about the impact of sexual abuse, the world refused to understand the depth of its consequences. That once you are raped, once your body is taken against your will, once you are invaded and dominated your body ceases to be your own. You become a thing, what Virginia called a toy, to be used and abused and tossed and discarded.Then the press, repeating infuriating, ignorant questions and notions: “Why didn’t she leave? No one was forcing her to stay. She could have walked away at any time. She was 16. She wasn’t eight. She clearly stayed for the money.” Still not understanding or perhaps refusing to understand that once you have been raped, self-love and self-agency or even the belief that you and your body are worth saving, have been decimated. That because you were forced to separate from your own body at the moment of invasion, you have essentially become a dehumanized object no longer worthy of protection. You are lost, a walking ghost in a permanent fog with no real ability to fight for yourself.And once you have been raped you have an aura, a stamp of brokenness that until you have begun to heal, constantly attracts more abusers who can smell your vulnerability and do their best to exploit it. It is clear in all the reports coming out that Epstein and Maxwell conducted interviews with each young woman to assess the degree of this brokenness and exploitability. Or maybe the attack was brought on by living in America, a country currently led by a president, anadjudicated rapist, a man who openly hates women, living in a zone caught in a childhood sexual abuse seizure.Months, even years of survivors bravely telling their stories, pressing charges, in hopes of getting accountability and justice and instead being gaslit, degraded, threatened and disbelieved. A zone devoted for years to protecting an international ring of the powerful men, all of them either rapists or pedophiles or willing to associate with them without concern or outrage.The attack on my body was still shocking. Here, at 72, some 66 years after my own abuse, after years of work attempting to heal through every kind of therapy trying to transform my being from a colonized entity, an invaded landscape a field of rubble. All those years of dedicated work and still this rape lives in my cells, lived in the cells of Virginia, in the collective cells of millions, actually a billion women survivors who attempt to live every day, struggling their way out of darkness.Rape is betrayal, invasion and theft. It murders the life force of the victim. Like plutonium it lodges itself forever in the chemistry of the bodyWe have names for it, sure – PTSD, recurring trauma or some diagnosis that often renders survivors insane. But the truth is survivors can read the room. They can surmise from the lack of care, accountability and justice that their anxiety is based in reality, a landscape where not only is there no safety or protection but where underground rings of sex trafficking emerge each day.So let me try for the millionth time to explain. Maybe you will open your hearts. Maybe you will dig deep into yourself to try to have empathy and understanding, Rape is betrayal, invasion and theft. It murders the life force of the victim. Like plutonium it lodges itself forever in the chemistry of the body. It robs us of sleep, trust, our ability to be intimate. It destroys self-esteem. It distorts our desire.For almost 60 years I have tried to understand what pleasure, what satisfaction any man or woman could take in ripping apart a child or a woman’s body against her will.Where does such hate come from, such disregard? There are many theories – men’s rage at their mothers for their dependency, the jealous need to destroy life force, innocence and beauty, the simple unchecked trajectory of men’s need for conquest and dominance.Whatever the causes, what matters now is how we stop this rampant insane abuse. Sex trafficking is a $200bn international industry. We are living in a world, as Manon Garcia describes in her new masterpiece about the Pelicot trials, Living with Men, constructed by “a scaffolding of rape”.Jeffrey Epstein’s emails reveal a disdain for morality among the elite | Moira DoneganRead moreVirginia says near the end of her book:“I’m learning to accept that sometimes I will simply not be okay. That is the process of serious trauma. It lays you low and sometimes makes you your own worst enemy. My goal is to prevent the emotional time bomb that lives inside me – my toxic memories and devastating visualizations of myself being hurt – from every detonating again.” Tragically the last explosion took her life.But there is another timebomb about to explode and it will if there is no accountability or justice for the Epstein victims. This time it will be directed outward. It will be the alchemized rage of millions of survivors, who have had enough, who cannot and will not live a day longer with this torturous injustice.V (formerly Eve Ensler) is a playwright and activist and the founder of V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women and girlsInformation and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Nicolas Guillou cannot shop online. When he used Expedia to book a hotel in his own country, the reservation was cancelled within hours. He is “blacklisted by much of the world’s banking system”, unable to use most bank cards.Guillou, you see, has been sanctioned by the United States, putting him on a15,000-strong listalongside al-Qaida terrorists, drug cartels and Vladimir Putin. Why? Because alongside two other judges of the international criminal court pre-trial chamber I, he approved arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and Mohammed Deif, the former commander of Hamas’s military wing. Guillou and his colleagues had “actively engaged in the ICC’s illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel”,the US claimedwhen imposing the sanctions in June. All are now barred from entering the US – but that is the least of the consequences.The rationale is brutally clear. The rule of law does not apply to the world’s hegemon or its closest allies. This was bluntly spelled out by Republican senator Lindsey Graham, who told the ICC chief prosecutor, Karim Khan – himself sanctioned –that the ICCwas “made for Africa and thugs like Putin, not democracies like Israel”. The US refused to sign up to the court, clearly fearing that its propensity to commit war crimes in foreign lands would lead to prosecutions. That put Washington in the same bracket as human rights abusers like China, Russia and indeed Israel. Only because Palestine acceded to the court a decade ago does the ICC now have jurisdiction over crimes committed on its territory or by its citizens.Guillou and his colleagues issued their warrants after a lengthy, cautious legal process. The case against the Israeli politicians focused on the use of starvation, which Israeli leaders routinely confessed to. Gallant had announced “a complete siege on the Gaza Strip” on the grounds Israel was fighting “human animals”, whileNetanyahu declared: “We will not allow humanitarian assistance in the form of food and medicines from our territory to the Gaza Strip.”In spring 2024, two US government agencies concluded that Israel was deliberately blocking humanitarian aid – an assessment that, according to US legislation, required halting all arms transfers. The US government disregarded its own law.The obliteration of Gaza, the indiscriminate killing of its people, the systematic targeting of civilian infrastructure – we could go on – has led to a consensus among genocide scholars that Israel is committing genocide. But for the US and its allies, maintaining Israel’s impunity matters more than preserving any semblance of an international order. Nearly four decades ago, the then senatorJoe Biden told Congressthat Israel was “the best $3bn investment we make”, claiming that “were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interest in the region”. The US regards Israel as an indispensable strategic asset, which is why it is the biggest ever recipient ofUS foreign aid, including military assistance. Washington will keep supplying the weapons that enable Israeli war crimes – and then threaten anyone who tries to hold the perpetrators to account.Other western countries have followed the US lead. Italy is an ICC member state, butdecided to undermine the courtby reassuring Netanyahu he would not face arrest if he visited.So did France, and it has since failed to stand up for one of its own citizens for fulfilling his legal responsibilities, while serving an international institution France helped to found.

Whatever remained of that political tradition lies buried in Gaza’s pulverised landscape. Much of the world has witnessed Israel’s daily atrocities against the Palestinian people – including in the US itself,where half the populationthink genocide was committed, with only a little over a third denying it. Who will ever again accept western lectures on human rights or the “rules-based order”?Time and again, western disdain for international law has rebounded as a strategic disaster. After the Soviet Union collapsed, US elites persuaded themselves that American military power was unchallengeable. That belief helped unleash the illegal invasion of Iraq, which destroyed Washington’s aura of unbeatable strength and shredded the west’s supposed moral authority. The contempt for international law displayed in Iraq helpedclear the pathfor Putin’s later aggression against Ukraine. In Afghanistan,the war crimescommitted by US-led forces stoked resentment which resuscitated the Taliban, ending in shattering military and strategic humiliation.The international legal system was always tilted in the west’s favour. That South Africa dared to accuse a key western ally of genocide at the international court of justice tells its own story, as does the support it received from much of the global south and European states such as Spain. The same logic applies to the ICC, which many western states assumed would be used only against their enemies or powerless nations. That this assumption no longer holds is itself a measure of western decline. Waging a campaign against judges who apply the law consistently will not arrest that fall. It will accelerate it. The west’s own hubris sent its power into freefall in the 21st century. There is still a long way down.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The vast majority will be spent meeting Labour’s fiscal rules and paying for U-turnsWed 26 Nov 2025 13.43 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 15.24 ESTShareImagine it: you are the chancellor of a government in mortal peril. Poll ratings are down the U-bend; backbenchers are mutinous and colleagues are circling around the prime minister, readying themselves to land the fatal blow. You have a budget, which may be your last chance to avert the inevitable. What do you do?If you’re Rachel Reeves, youuse it to buy time. Time for Keir Starmer and you to carry on in office for a while longer, so perhaps your luck will change. Extra time for this unfortunate, empty, placeholder of a PM costs more than olive oil, but the chancellor still splashed out. This afternoon, she delivered a budget that was a £26bn attempt to buy her government some time.That £26bn will be paid not by businesses but by you and me, as taxes are pushed up to an all-time high. She will spend the cash to placate bond investors and calm down angry backbenchers by increasing the “headroom” to meet her own fiscal rules, and on measures such as scrapping thetwo-child benefit cap. And it will work, for a while. But even while many of those moves are good, they are small. Bundle up all the spending and tax policies and the budget is huge, but look at the measures one by one and they are mainly loose change. You can say the same about the likely impact of this budget.A little breather, yes – enough for this historically unpopular pair to stay in Downing Street a while longer. But a gamechanger? No. When the public judge Starmer and Reeves as worse than the calamity couple ofLiz TrussandKwasi Kwarteng, then however unfair the situation, it’s beyond saving.Such desperation has marked this budget from the start, through all the leaks and bungling. A “circus” is how the Bank of England’s former chief economist Andy Haldanedescribes it– and that was before some poor sod at the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)had an off-day. Except circuses are meant to be fun. All this speculation has achieved has been to put businesses off investing and crushed growth, as even the Bank murmurs discreetly in itslatest monetary policy report.Governments use budgets to set an agenda, tell a story, pick a side. Remember Gordon Brown and his crusade to end child poverty, which he very nearly won. Think of George Osborne and his drive to squeeze public services and social security. Years before he brought in the loathsome child-benefit cap, David Cameron was arguing for it. Then look at our first female chancellor, obviously gifted andLabourto her fingertips, but unable to show us why. Why she’s in No 11, what she wants to do with power, or even with this budget.The brutal truth, as theJoseph Rowntree Foundation observes, is that the vast majority of the taxes raised today will go on padding out the margin to meet her fiscal rules. Another slug will be spent on paying for all those U-turns forced on Reeves and Starmer. Only 20% will go on new measures “actually making people better off”.What a way to waste a landslide majority. Small measures to improve voters’ lives – cutting energy bills, freezing train fares and prescription charges – will barely be noticed against a backdrop of rising bills (especially for food) and flat wages. Almost a million workers will be dragged into the 40% higher tax band by the end of this year, even while public services continue to struggle. For all the extra billions that have gone to Wes Streeting, it’s not enough to make up the lag at the NHS: 22% of patients wait more than six weeks for diagnostic tests,MPs reported recently. The standard is meant to be 1%. The MPs expressed “significant concerns” that the shake-up of NHS England “has been announced without either delivery plans or funding in place”.If you are already worrying about the prospect of 2029 bringing Nigel Farage into No 10, then look at the finding from the OBR on how household take-home pay will rise over the rest of this decade. Because it will barely rise at all: just 0.25% a year every year until the general election. That is what a cost of living crisis looks like – but it’s also how a political breakdown takes hold. It’s well down even on the 2010s, the rage-filled decade that gave us Brexit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To gee up the Labour base, she promised an end to austerity. To win over Tories, she pledged that none of the big three taxes would go up. And to make peace with financial markets, she tied herself up with fiscal rules that are simply too tight. As I and a few others argued at the time, these three goals are incompatible. To deliver capital-C change you need to raise revenue or borrow. Most of all, you need to level with voters and tell them that without this money, their kids’ classrooms will continue to leak and their parents will wait for ever to get their cataracts done. Labour never came clean. It blustered about growth, then broke its manifesto promise by hitting employers with a rise in national insurance. Wednesday’s big stealth rise in taxes breaks its promises again.And for what? To save its skin. The very regime adopted by Reeves to ensure stability – relying on the OBR despite poor forecasts and productivity downgrades, tying herself into tight fiscal rules – is a large part of why this government is so unstable. And Westminster turbulence will roil financial markets. Asset managers are already sending out slide decks giving their views on which of the possible replacements for Starmer in No 10 will be best for gilt investors. Andy Burnham, who warned of a government “in hock” to bond markets, is not viewed too highly, you won’t be surprised to learn. Rather more sobering is the implication that financial markets, while paying no party subs and wielding no votes, will have a say in choosing this country’s next prime minister.But all that is not a question for this week – and for that Starmer should thank Reeves, who has probably done enough to stave off an imminent collapse. For now.You can call this budget The One Where Rachel Buys Time but, as the old song goes, it’s always later than you think. I’ll be around for years and years, Reeves told Labour MPs this week. But she knows they’re measuring out the rest of her term, and that of her boss next door, in weeks and months.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I Love LA, theHBO comedyset among wannabe gen Z influencers, is only halfway through its eight-episode run, but it is already comfortably the best show of the year. And more importantly, it has triggered all the signifiers of event TV: obsessive repeat viewings, line-by-line coverage,big platform profilesof its stars andweekly recapson Vulture, New York magazine’s website. Within days of each episode airing, people havetranscribed and uploadedthe entire script, which – with the best will in the world – no one’s doing forRiot Women.The surprising thing about this is not the fact that it’s the first show by Rachel Sennott, the show’s 30-year-old creator and star, or that the action takes place in a tiny world in east LA, but that content about influencers can be watchable at all. To date, millennial and older writers have tended to use social media as a lumbering plot device – oh my God, something’s gone “viral!” – or as a stand-in for the collapse of all known standards. You probably haven’t watched these because nobody did, but take your pick from: HBO’s one-season disasterThe Girls on the Bus, in which an old-media reporter covers a US election race only to find that influencers – those pesky kids! – have stolen her patch. Or the equally horrific Netflix flopGirlboss, loosely based on the memoirs of Sophia Amoruso, the early influencer, and which not even a cameo by Cole Escola could save. Or Flack, the deathly Anna Paquin-fronted show about publicists trying to manage their clients’ social media, and an early red flag for which was the use of the word “maven” in the show’s publicity.Sennott’s elevator pitch for I Love LA was “Entourage for internet girls”, and unlike those other shows, she’s writing from inside the house: the series is based on her move from New York to LA in 2020 and her years of being young, broke and striving in a lonely and competitive city.View image in fullscreenRachel Sennott in I Love LA.Photograph: HBO/SKY ComedyAs such, I Love LA is as current as Girls was in 2012 and tells the story of Maia, a new-hire entertainment manager trying to wrangle her old pal and only client, Tallulah, into taking off as an influencer, while hanging out with Charlie, an uber-gay stylist, and the nepo baby Alani, played deliciously by real nepo baby True Whitaker (daughter of Forest). The success of the show isn’t only about youth. At the risk of sounding likeTina Brown’s Substack, while there is definite buzz around the age of the show’s creator and actors and the fact that it feels like the first really authentic gen Z comedy, the show is as much about sensibility. I would say I Love LA has more in common with Platonic, thehit show about middle ageon Apple TV+, than with much younger pieces. (There’s a great joke about Cara Delevingne in the Platonic pilot that could easily sit in the new HBO show.)And I Love LA has almost certainly benefited from the sheer amount of garbage on TV at the moment. That one with Claire Danes and Matthew Rhys, in which her chin wobble carries most of the drama and both their managers should’ve had a word about lighting (Rhys looks like the waxwork of a deposed dictator.) Or the new one withDavid Duchovny– if you got further than 10 minutes in, I commend you. Reviews for I Love LA haven’t been universally good; plenty of people point out that it takes a minute to find its footing. But it is so fresh and real that it makes even recent hits like Hacks look stagey and sitcom.Ultimately, it’s a question of confidence, and the show assumes you will catch the references to Diddy, understand whyKramer vs Kramer is funny, field the drive-by on the LA fires, and appreciate the comedic truth of, “What am I supposed to do, wait in line like an assistant at UTA?” The show occupies a world that the creators also live in and don’t feel inclined to explain. If youdon’t get the line“I just wasted $612 on a straight fire victim queer-baiter,” then I Love LA invites you, politely, to return to the tepid pleasures of shows about women who hate their husbands and wonder if they’re living the wrong life (almost certainly, yes).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s what Labour budgets do, boosting the low-paid, taking from the well-off. Children always come first, as 450,000 will bereleased from poverty, more than in any budget before. The chancellor reeled off Labour’s too often ignored child-first priorities: universal nurseries from nine months, breakfast clubs, more free school meals, school libraries, a youth guarantee. No, not back to 2010, but it’s progress. This doesn’t totally restore Sure Start, but in Best Start we see the beginnings ofits rebirth.After four months of tortured U-turns, dithering and leaking that spooked markets and paralysed spending, here is a far better budget than doomster predictions. But there should have been a political rolling out of the red carpet in advance to announce a redder budget than expected. Those with least got most: £900 more per year for 2.4 million peopleon the minimum wage. Prescriptions and fuel duty are frozen, frozen rail fares will save commutersaround £300a year. Energy bills are eased by taking the green levies back to the Treasury. It was high time to restore a little justice by taxing properties worth more than £2m. But, yes, the freezing of income tax thresholds amounts to the income tax rise that was pledged against. May all other future chancellors learn from Rachel Reeves’s original great sin, binding herself in iron fiscal chains. Never again.Labour’s enemies will of course ferociously tear all this apart. How the opposite benches howled down abolishing the benefit cap. Alas, this dissent is backed by a majority of the public, who think scroungers have babies-on-benefits. Not so – all evidence shows it hasminimal effecton birth rate. But this is a country mainly nurtured through the years on mean-minded Toryism. A Labour government now and then, with Labour budgets, reminds us that there is a better Britain that can do good. Not enough, not brave or radical enough. I don’t know if this will help reverse Labour’s desperate political misfortunes, but it should at least remind people who have lost trust what Labour governments are for.I’ll say it: this budget didn’t hit the rich hard enoughJulia DaviesMillionaire investor, lawyer and a member of Patriotic MillionairesFirst and foremost, it is wrong to ask working people to contribute more throughfreezing income tax thresholds, while the wealthiest in society are broadly left untouched. In a country with such extraordinary levels of wealthat the very top, the government should be looking to those most able to contribute more, not turning to those who are already doing their part.The additional council tax surcharge on homes worth more than £2m and higher rates on investment income show a limited willingness to move in the right direction. These steps are far too small to make any real impact on thelevels of inequalitywe are expected to tolerate. This lack of ambition on taxing the super-rich does not meet the needs of the moment. Instead, it shifts yet more pressure on to everyone else.If the government chooses to reverse course on today’s decisions, there is still time to create a tax system that works for everyone. What our country needs is determination, will and clarity of purpose from our political leaders to deliver an economy that works for all of us, not just people like me.The members of Patriotic Millionaires and I will continue to push our government for ambitious economic reform. The UK cannot afford any further piecemeal approach to the economy. While an annual wealth tax is not a panacea, it signals the kind of change required to put people first and address deep-rooted inequality. There is still time in this parliament to achieve this.A ‘mansion tax’ sounds good, but it’s not the reform we needAbi O'ConnorUrban sociologist and honorary fellow at the University of LiverpoolOur housing system is a key driver of the gap between rich and poor in society. This is becausecouncil tax bandshave not been recalibrated since 1991. Retaining this system reinforces regional inequality and ensures the most expensive homes are chronically undertaxed.While increasing council tax on homes worth more than £2m is a small step in the right direction from this government, it lacks the ambition the country was promised. Genuine reform could be achieved bysimply implementingproportional property tax, in which every home’s tax rate is set annually in line with its actual market value.It is right that the wealthiest pay more, and it is right that unearned wealth via assets such as property is taxed appropriately, yet this watered-down “mansion tax” alone will raise only a tiny sum (£400m), and not before 2028. We need a wholesale re-evaluation of how all property is taxed. This will be foundational to rebalancing the housing system and raising public money, therefore today’s announcement is a deflection from the fundamental issue: our inherently regressive council tax system.If this is a tax-raising budget guided by Labour values, why has it shied away from a widely accepted reform that would raise significant finance and address a key driver of inequality?Unfortunately, this budget is emblematic of Labour’s parliament thus far: mired with missed opportunities. This government is clutching at straws because it lacks the courage to tax the wealthiest adequately, and the conviction to properly support the millions struggling to pay their rent and bills.Where’s the offer for young people?Jason OkundayeAssistant newsletter editor and writer at the GuardianFor years now, young people have said they feel overlooked by the government’s spending priorities, and this budget is no exception. Announcements of an above-inflation 4.8% increase in the state pension have been paired with a £2,000 per year cap on national insurance-free salary sacrifice schemes for those saving for a pension. This is particularly unfair for middle-income young people, as their prudent financial planning is turned into another opportunity for a tax raid – and with fears that we are unlikely to see the same state pension as boomers when we retire, we will be even more dependent on these private pots. A freeze on tax thresholds becomes a tax-by-stealth. Even minimum wage increases for 18– to 20-year-olds are portended by the Resolution Foundation asdriving unemployment, at a time whennearly a millionyoung people are economically inactive.Further,reforms to the Isa allowancefor under-65s, with £8,000 of the £20,000 now designated for special stocks-and-shares Isa options, will surely restrict savings for the future. It is right to address the low rates of retail investment and encourage engagement with the stock market, but with young people having grown up under the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis and Covid, and with the threat of the AI bubble bursting, they should be able to commit the full amount to fixed-rate, low-risk accounts if they wish.These may feel like only the concerns of a high-income fraction, but in the absence of packaged offers for young people, the narrative that emerges is one of a broken social contract. Highly educated middle-earners and Henrys (high earners, not rich yet) ask where the promised reward of stability is after pursuing competitive degrees and intense jobs, while growing resentful at others they believe are getting a free ride (see the popular “Nicolas, 30 ans” meme). And if this golden ticket of education and work is false, then why not forgo it and try to get rich quick with crypto?I believe in progressive taxation, and as a childless gen Z I am happy for my taxes to go to breakfast clubs and lifting the two-child benefit cap. But the lack of concessions for young workers is invariably driving some others to the right, who direct their angst towards recipients of welfare, social housing occupants, migrants and pensioners.Pensioner povertyis a real issue, yet the image of cruise-taking over-65s funded by the young dominates.The UK has plenty of taxes – what are we getting for all this new spending?John RedwoodConservative MP for Wokingham from 1987 to 2024The budget is bad for industry, bad for jobs, bad for young people trying to get a start in life and find an affordable home, bad for savings and investment and bad for growth. Allowing a two-month run-in with scare stories about every kind of tax rise hit confidence. It stopped some businesses offering new jobs and committing to new investments. The shadow of the first disastrousbudgetloomed over the country as we saw for ourselves unemploymentrise, job vacanciesfall, inflation go up and growth stumble to nothing as the budget measures hit home.This time the chancellor was ready with her excuses. She has latched on to the misleading Office for Budget Responsibility forecast of a4% hit to UK GDPfrom Brexit, meant to occur over a 15-year period. We know this was wrong as UK GDP growthoutperformedmajor EU countries such as France and Germany in many of the post-referendum years. Reeves seeks to assist a PM who thinks we should spend large sums on joining EU projects, including a preposterous £5bn to allow companies to bid for defence contracts, contrary to world trade rules. Why not spend the money on buying UK weapons for our own military?The UK is not short of taxes. The government plans to spend £185bn more next year than in the last full year under the Conservatives. What will we get for all that cash? How much of it is going on more illegal migrants and low pay, or no-pay legal migrants and their hotel and housing needs? How much on the huge losses of the Bank of England? How much on needlessly giving away theChagos islands?More taxes will do us harm and encourage even more talented and wealthy people to leave. Some of the tax rises will cost us dear as those who could pay decide not to, avoiding taxes by leaving or by spending and investing less. The biggest losers are young people less likely to get a job or be able to afford a home of their own.Taking green policy costs off household bills is a good first stepSarah NankivellDeputy director of Common WealthLabour entered government suggesting that action on the climate would take care of the cost of living,almost automatically. It has rightly responded to rising anxieties around the latter by prioritising immediaterelief to bills, while resisting the equally simplistic notion that net zero will cost households more. But room still remains to reduce the tension and maximise the complementarity.Successive governments’ resistance to tax rises has made electricity bills the vessel forgreen policy leviesthat could be funded through progressive general taxation. Moving these levies off bills is an important landmark – these policies have driven up electricity costs since the pandemic and made electricity structurally more expensive than gas. This precedent must be built upon.The budget’s announcements reaffirm the assumption that lower bills in the short term are only achievable by shifting costs from households to government while leaving the source of those costs unchanged. In particular, the energy companies, whose “renewables obligation” subsidies will now be majority-funded by government, have been enjoying handsome windfalls. In the meantime, the public are told to wait for new renewables to gradually reduce market prices.Another green levy removed from bills is theenergy company obligationthat funded part of the warm homes plan to reduce future demand. The plan is intended to help people with energy efficiency and insulation upgrades, so much will depend on how this is rolled out and whether it is adequately resourced.Ultimately the transition demands a scale of investment beyond existing commitments. Surging military spending redirects scarce manufacturing capacity away from technologies needed for the energy transition. The choice to sign up to Nato’s arbitrary 5% target – which Stockholm International Peace Research Institute suggests would mean finding an extra £136bn per year by 2035–shows that fiscal rules can be bent and bond markets resisted when government decides.On tax, Reeves chose ad hoc revenue grabs over big changesAndy SummersDirector of the Centre for the Analysis of Taxation and associate professor at London School of Economics and Political Science Law SchoolThis may feel like a “big budget” of tax reforms, but that’s only because successive governments have done so little in the way of serious reform that we’ve forgotten what it looks like. Overall, the tax changes announced today are unlikely to move the needle on growth much one way or the other.There is still no sense that the government has a vision for a good tax system, let alone a strategy for getting there. In this climate, the risk is that even moves in the right direction – such as on council tax – still come across as ad hoc revenue-grabs rather than principled efforts to make the tax system fairer and more efficient.For a government that’s supposedly obsessed with growth, we seem no closer to the realisation that our broken tax system is part of the UK’s growth problem, and that major structural reforms – not just rate-changes or more bolt-ons – are needed to fix it.A strategy for pro-growth tax reforms is already out there and ready to be picked up. Recently,authors from CenTax and eight other thinktanksfrom across the political spectrum declared agreement on the way ahead. It’s regrettable that this budget contains barely a hint of progress against any of the seven reform packages we proposed.For instance, reforming capital gains tax to provide a pro-growth investment allowance, alongside equalising the rate with income tax. And abolition of stamp duty alongside a full reform of council tax.Outside government, the need for serious tax reform is universally accepted and there is remarkable agreement over how to do it. We must turn our attention to the reasons why successive governments have failed to deliver, despite this consensus. It would be wise to start thinking about this now, because 10 weeks out from the next budget will be too late.Explore more on these topicsBudget 2025The panelTax and spendingEconomic policyEconomicsTaxEconomic growth (GDP)commentShareReuse this content"

But they also indicate just how much our economy is caught up in the ramifications of Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine, which sent gas prices higher – and with it our electricity prices.The October consumer price index figures were a turning point for data in Australia. It marks the change of the official CPI figures going from quarterly to monthly. This is pretty much the biggest data shift since the labour force figures back in 1978 did the same switch from quarterly to monthly.The move is a good one, given most nations in the OECD measure prices monthly. It gives the Reserve Bank and the government more regular information.For a number of years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics had been testing measuring inflation monthly, but it left out a few things while it worked out how to count everything. As a result, the latest figures are slightly different from the old monthly figures:If the graph does not display click hereOn the old measure, inflation was slightly lower than the new official measure.This is also reflected with the “trimmed mean” measure of underlying inflation. While the old monthly figures suggested underlying inflation was below 3%, the new official figures have it at 3.3%If the graph does not display click hereThe underlying inflation measure will probably take on more importance now that the official measure has moved to a monthly survey. The overall CPI figures will now be rather more noisy than they were when they involved an average of three months.You can see how this affects things when you look at the monthly growth since April 2024 (which is how far back the official monthly data goes). Rather oddly, despite the annual inflation figure rising in October, in October itself inflation did not rise at all:If the graph does not display click hereThis weirdness is even more stark when we look at the biggest drivers of inflation:If the graph does not display click hereElectricity was the biggest driver of inflation over the past year, but in October electricity prices fell 10.2%.This confusion is due to the interaction of electricity rebates and inflation.In July 2023, the Albanese government introduced rebates to protect against the increase in prices due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In July 2024, the states began to get involved as well. And October last year saw the largest impact of the federal and state government rebates on electricity prices:If the graph does not display click hereBut these rebates did not last, and over the past 12 months they have begun to be unwound – and so prices began to rise. Then in August they were extended across a number of areas – and so electricity prices fell again.But they remain well above where they were in October last year.Importantly, inflation is the growth of prices from one month to the next, and from one month to the same month the following year. So purely because last October was the month where the energy rebates had the biggest impact, the annual growth in electricity prices since then looks massive.The days of 4% pay rises are behind us – wages are now barely growing faster than inflation | Greg JerichoRead moreWere the government rebates not put in place, electricity costs would be about 31% higher now, but the growth (or inflation) of electricity costs would be lower.But then the question is: why were these rebates needed, and what the heck does it have to do with Putin invading Ukraine?The problem for Australia is that since the opening of the Gladstone LNG terminal, gas prices on the eastern seaboard have been linked with the world price of gas. Because Russia is a major producer of gas, its invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions of Russian gas and other trade sent world gas prices soaring – doubling from January 2022 to September that year.Gas is a significant generator of Australia’s electricity, but it is also among the most expensive. However, the way the national energy market operates is that the most expensive source for electricity determines the price at any point in time.When renewables are able to supply 100% of our electricity, they will determine the cost and prices will be much lower. But because gas often sets the prices (because gas-generated electricity is needed to meet demand), that means there is a very strong link between gas prices and electricity:If the graph does not display click hereWithout the energy rebates, electricity prices would have followed gas prices up, and the hit to households would have been much greater.On the other side of the coin, the boom in gas prices has led to gas companies making out like bandits.The value of gas exports from Australia is nearly four times what it was a decade ago. Alas this massive windfall gain for gas companies has not led to a windfall in revenue of the government in the form of the petroleum resource rent tax – if anything, revenue has fallen:If the graph does not display click hereThese latest inflation figures will give few people any joy – not the RBA, nor the government, nor any of us looking at our bills. But they will continue to give comfort to energy and gas producers who know their windfall profits will remain largely untouched by Australia’s tax system.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsAustralian economyGrogonomicsInflationEnergyGascommentShareReuse this content"

Some, like my current canine companion, have been both adoring and adorable, but others have been less successful. I’m thinking of the hamster who scarfed down her babies, the cockerel who karate-kicked the kids and our current cat, who is so aloof that she says “meh” instead of “miaow”.So it was with interest that I learned that urban raccoons in North America areshowing signs of domestication. A study in Frontiers in Zoologysuggests that the animals are evolving to be – as the mainstream media puts it – “cuter” and “more pet-like”. Jump ahead three thought bubbles and I’m picturing me, holding paws with my new pet, skipping through the daisies to the tune of Daydream Believer. But could this really be?According to prevailing wisdom, humans have been domesticating wild things for at least30,000 years. Dogs were first, followed by chickens, sheep, pigs and more. As food became easier to source, people put down roots. The hunter-gatherer way of life gave way to settlements, cities and complex societies. Clever old us, working it all out.Only it didn’t quite happen that way. In its earliest stages, domestication isn’t about humanschoosingto do anything. It’s more about animals choosing us, or more precisely, the places where we live.When raccoons first tiptoed into our towns, they noticed two things: a lack of large predators and an abundance of bins. The wary backed away but the least skittish took advantage. With their stomachs full ofburgers,thesewere the animals most likely to survive and pass on their “not so skittish” genes to the next generation. Over time, the city-dwelling raccoons became bolder. This is natural selection at its finest. So humans didn’t decide to start domesticating the raccoon – the so-calledtrash pandasstarted domesticating themselves.To those who live near raccoons, this should come as no surprise. These are super-smart animals with a can-do attitude. They ridethe subway, camouflage themselves aslampshade pendantsand organise Mission Impossible-style heists. In one incident a raccoon descended from the ceiling of a Toronto bakery tosteal an orange doughnut.To the brazen belong the spoils, but that’s not all. The study, from researchers at the University of Arkansas, found that the snouts of urban-dwelling raccoons are 3.5% shorter than those of their rural counterparts. This, they say, is the key sign that domestication is taking place.Scour the range of domesticated animals, from goats to guinea pigs, and you’ll notice a collection of common features that crop up again and again. These include decreased brain and body size, shorter snouts, floppy ears, curly tails and patchy markings. Collectively these features are referred to asdomestication syndrome, and the idea is that as animals become tamer over time, these other features often hitch along for the ride.Evidence for this comes from the work of the late Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyaev, who started breeding silver foxes (a colour variant of the red fox) in 1959. Each generation he chose the calmest, least fearful animals and let them produce offspring together.Ten generations later,the animals were becoming friendlier and starting to acquire piebald markings, droopy ears and curly tails. This was followed by changes to their skeleton, including shorter snouts and legs. Belyaev didn’t set out to make flatter-faced, waggy-tailed foxes, but that’s exactly what he got.There is a theory that says this quirk occurs because the process of domestication, and the many small genetic changes that underpin it, affect the behaviour of a group of cells called theneural crest. During embryonic development, neural crest cells disperse through the body, where they help to make certain cells (including pigment cells), organs (such as the adrenal gland, which controls the stress response) and structures (such as the ears, snout and tail). Once animals begin being selected for “tameness”, or more docile behaviour, influenced by the adrenal glands, all the other features affected by neural crest cells start changing too.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So if you think raccoons are cute now, just wait till this happens!But don’t expect to preorder your pet raccoon just yet. The raccoons of North America remain in the very earliest stages of domestication. We know from the evolutionary history of dogs that if full domestication is ever to happen, humans will need to step in and deliberately start selectively breeding them. This “artificial selection” is what has created the many thousands of domestic breeds we have today.In the meantime, close your windows and lock up your leftovers, because for as long as we continue to leave food around, the trash pandas willcontinue to find it. And to the people of North America, I say this: you can choose to love or hate them, but please love them. Raccoons are living embodiment of theWombles, making good use of the things that they find, things that the everyday folks leave behind.Helen Pilcher is a science writer and the author ofBring Back the King: The New Science of De-ExtinctionExplore more on these topicsAnimalsOpinionWildlifeMammalsPetscommentShareReuse this content"

But will it dare tell the whole truth about Britain’s predicament?Wed 26 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 07.49 ESTShareRachel Reeves has approached this week’s budget like a reluctant swimmer inching into freezing water, trying to ease the unpleasantness by incremental exposure. The chancellor started paddling delicately around the problem of insufficient revenue at the end of the summer. First, she refused tostand by former insistencethat tax rises in last year’s budget would be the last. “The world has changed,” she said.Then, earlier this month, she took a bigger stride into the icy waves. There was a speech promising to “do what is necessary” to fund public services and keep borrowing costs down. Downing Streetdid not discourage speculationthat this meant reneging on Labour’s2024 manifesto promisenot to raise income tax. Too deep! Within 10 days the Treasury had retracted the hint. The manifesto commitment still stood after all. As any cold-water swimmer knows, this aborted plunge and shivering retreat is the worst of all techniques. Nothing prolongs the pain like indecision.It is hard to be decisive when choosing between degrees of self-inflicted harm. Breaking an unambiguous campaign pledge would have simplified Reeves’s fiscal challenge but shredded her remaining political authority. The alternative route, chosen after some vacillation, is to carry on raising many small taxes instead of one big one. The political cost might be the same, but it is spread out over a longer period, during which the chancellor can hope that something – a productivity and growth miracle – will turn up.Hope has not been a great strategy for this government. At the core of Keir Starmer’s general election campaign was the vain hope of somehow satisfying voters’ demand for improved public services without reversing billions of pounds of Tory tax cuts. Once the revenue shortfall could no longer be denied, the Treasury hoped that well-off pensioners would surrender their winter fuel payments and that employers would swallow a national insurance hike without too much fuss. When forecasts of fiscal headroom came in low once again, Downing Street hoped Labour MPs would vote to make up the difference with welfare cuts.At no point has either Starmer or Reeves successfully communicated a sense of national purpose to justify all this pain. Partly that is a problem of charisma. The prime minister and the chancellor are uncannily alike in their communicative deficiency, stilted and reticent in a way that pushes audiences away instead of drawing them in.But their failure to imbue hard political choices with a sense of underlying moral mission has a deeper cause. It expresses the contradiction inherent in an election strategy that promised change through continuity. Alongside collusion in Conservative fiscal fantasies that meant alsoacquiescence to Boris Johnson’s Brexit settlement. The twin fears were that swing voters would freak out if they thought Reeves was a tax-and-spend fiend or Starmer might smuggle remainer convictions into Downing Street.Just as political pressure to invest in public services has forced the Treasury to admit that taxes must rise, the economic imperative of boosting growth makes it ever harder to ignore the cost of detachment from the European single market.And so begins another timorous creep down to the waterfront. The government spent a year splashing in the shallow end of realignment with the EU: proposals to end customs checks on agricultural goods;a youth mobility scheme. Ambition went a bit deeper on energy,defence and security cooperation, but nothing of substance has yet been signed.In the absence of clear direction and impetus from No 10, talks are bogged down. The European Commission says single-market privileges are unlocked withcontributions to the EU budget. UK ministers know that’s the deal. That doesn’t make them eager for a public row and Nigel Farage howling treason over whatever price ends up being paid.There was once a lobby in Brussels for strategic generosity to Britain. Officials and some national leaders argued that the long-term cause of bolstering continental solidarity, given the military threat from Russia and the unreliability of Donald Trump’s US, justified exceptional concessions to a pro-European government in London. That case is weakened by fear that Starmer’s approach is just an interlude before Farage restores the old antagonism to No 10.Economic reality has provoked some change in Labour’s tone on the European question. Reeves has started namingBrexitalongside the Covid pandemic as a cause of economic damage that the Treasury is toiling to repair. Other ministers have followed suit, although they carefully attribute the fault to “a bad Brexit deal” or “the way we left the EU”, never just “Brexit”. The problem is couched as negligent negotiation, not strategic miscalculation.The difference matters. A bad deal might be replaced with a better one, which the prime minister can claim to be working on. What he never does is explainwhyJohnson’s deal was so bad; that its biggest flaws are the very things that its author called virtues; that it satisfied every demand of the radical leavers, making its failure a refutation of the whole edifice of Eurosceptic argument that had been assembled over decades.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The legacy of Brexit can’t be measured only in declining trade volumes when so many of the politicians who campaigned for it gleefully align themselves with a US administration that despises the rule of law and is busy blowing up the foundations of the US’s constitutional republic.The problem of Britain’s future relationship with the EU can’t be reduced to technical adjustments and border mechanisms when the whole geopolitical order is in tumultuous flux. Given everything that has happened since 2016, the year of the referendum and Trump’s first election victory, it feels legitimate still to be asking the big question: were Britain’s interests served by leaving the EU? And it is reasonable to note how theforeign state that saw the greatest benefitto itself in fracturing Europe’s democratic alliances, and that continues to machinate against western unity, is Vladimir Putin’s Russia.These are cold, uncomfortable facts about Britain’s predicament in choppy international waters. It is not surprising that the prime minister and the chancellor flinch from the challenge. It would take them way out of their depth, into currents that they dare not swim against. So instead they continue nervously pacing the shore, hoping that maybe soon the tide will turn.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsBudget 2025OpinionRachel ReevesKeir StarmerLabourTax and spendingEconomic policyBrexitcommentShareReuse this content"

And what does it take to save it? Those were the big questions being asked in Barcelona recentlyWed 26 Nov 2025 00.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 07.13 ESTShareThere’s an Irish saying,tír gan teanga, tír gan anam: a country without a language is a country without a soul. Representatives of some of Europe’s estimated 60 minority languages – or minoritised, as they define them – met in Barcelona recently to discuss what it means to lose a language, and what it takes to save it.Language diversity is akin to biodiversity, an indicator of social wellbeing, but some of Europe’s languages are falling into disuse. Breton, for example, is dying out because its speakers are dying, and keeping languages alive among young people is challenging in an increasingly monolingual digital world.Catalan, which is spoken by about 10 million people, is the poster child of successful minoritised languages. Thanks to decades of linguistic immersion in public education, from nursery to university, about93.4% of the populationcan speak or understand Catalan, in addition to Spanish. Both are co-official languages in Catalonia, and the result is a culture that is almost completely and unselfconsciously bilingual.However, the latest figures show that only32.6% of adultssay Catalan is the language they habitually use, and the numbers are falling, especially among younger people. Not without reason, many Catalans view the language as being in constant danger of being engulfed by Spanish (and, increasingly, by English too). One consequence of this concern is a tendency to treat Catalan more as a sacred, unalterable cultural artefact than a living language.In addition to regular subeditors, Catalan media employ “correctors” – effectively a language police, who stamp out any perceived impurities, word play or neologisms from broadcast or published output. The result is that the language can seem stiff and uncool, which partly accounts for its declining use among young people.“I speak a Valencian dialect of Catalan and it annoys me that people correct me, as though we all have to speak some perfect version of the language,” said Blanca Trull Armengol of the European Language Equality Network (ELEN), who organised theBarcelona conference. “It’s a living language, and just because we introduce words from other languages it shouldn’t be seen as some form of contamination.”Frisian is the mother tongue of Mirjam Vellinga, along with about 500,000 people in the northern Netherlands. She is a firm advocate of letting people indulge their creativity with the language, rather than bowing to a purist doctrine. “If it means introducing some Dutch or English, that’s fine,” she told me. “We don’t want to put it in a museum. When we lose a language, we lose a way of being and the connection with our ancestry. When people’s language is suppressed you see more depression and ill health because you’ve been robbed of part of your identity.”In a world increasingly dominated by identity politics, Vellinga added, some young people see speaking Frisian as a marker of cool. “There are rock bands that sing in Frisian, but we don’t have aKneecapunfortunately. We’re a bit jealous of Kneecap.”Rappers Kneecap are a key part of why Irish is riding the crest of a wave, with a big increase in people choosing to study the language at all levels of education. “Kneecap are rooted in the reality of young people,” says Conchúr Ó Muadaigh of Irish language association Conradh na Gaeilge. “Kneecap reflect the life and diversity of young people through the medium of Irish. But it’s not an academic language. Young people in their thousands are gravitating to them because of their authenticity.”In the Republic, about 1.9 million peoplecan speak Irish; it is in daily use by about 624,000. The language received an unexpected boost during the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Republican prisoners took to learning it, in what became known as the Jailtacht, a play on Gaeltacht, the Irish-speaking regions of Ireland.When the prisoners were released under the Good Friday agreement in 1998, many went into education and community activism and Irish began to flourish north of the border, where before it had been virtually extinct. In the Gaeltacht in the west of Ireland, however, thelanguage is in decline, partly as a result of the huge rise in the demand for holiday homes forcing young people to leave.This view is echoed by ELEN’s president, Elin Haf Gruffydd Jones, who says depopulation in rural areas is leading to a decline in the Welsh language in some parts of the country. “If you don’t have proper investment, you’re going to have depopulation, young people moving away, and if other people with more capital are buying second homes, you have a complete mismatch,” Jones says. “What we see is that wealth inequality equates with lack of language equality.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s what my tiny language can teach you | Ana SchnablRead moreOne success story has been the rise of the Basque language, Euskera, which, like Catalan, was suppressed under the Franco dictatorship. In Spain’s Basque region, parents can choose between three educational models: 100% Spanish, 50% Spanish and Euskera or 100% Euskera. Close to 90% of the population opt for the full Euskera model.Euskera is an ancient tongue, unrelated to any of the 100 or so Indo-European languages, and linguists continue to puzzle over its origins. However, to Manex Mantxola Urrate of the Euskera language association Kontseilua, that’s not the point.“To us, the mystery isn’t where it came from or when, but how it managed to get to where it is today, despite the hegemonic French and Spanish states, and the answer is because of an enduring sense of community,” he says. “What we need to protect is ourselves, it’s we who are in danger. We don’t have to save the language, the language is what will save us.”Clearly languages that are spoken by as many as 10 million people are very much alive, and a Eurobarometer survey last year showed that84% of Europeanssupport the EU’s minority languages. However, their limited presence on digital and social media threatens to increase their marginalisation. If they are to continue to evolve, the Kneecap effect suggests that the gatekeepers dedicated to maintaining their purity need to loosen their grip, and let these languages live a little.Stephen Burgen is a freelance writer who reports on SpainDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hannah had been taken to hospital in a critical state.As I heard the details of the gruesome murder of three children, with their mother fighting for her life after the attack from her estranged husband, I wondered about everyone being on the scene now – police, ambulance and reporters were all there. The feed was live, showing the charred car’s last fumes. But where was everyone one hour before? One day before?How come everybody was there so quickly but nobody was around to stop it happening?Statistically, there’s a reliable way to predict a domestic violence homicide like Hannah Clarke’sRead moreSince that day I have thought a lot about Hannah Clarke and her children. I have followed the implementation of coercive control laws and kept up with the news about domestic violence prevention strategies that followed these abhorrent murders. I was pleased to see the recognition of forms of coercive control being criminalised as a domestic violence offence. I understood these laws would have somehow helped Hannah and the children by giving the police grounds to charge and arrest Rowan Baxter at any point in the lead-up to the murders. My understanding of these deaths and the law reform was that of an outsider.Then one day a colleague passed on an inquiry from a whistleblower alleging misconduct in theQueenslandcoronial system and the Queensland police. I work in the Whistleblower Project at the Human Rights Law Centre, where we help whistleblowers speak up and fight for better laws to create more transparency and accountability.From our first phone call, it was clear this was not a one-off advice.This whistleblower we are calling Elsie(not her real name) made a number of allegations of police failings at the service delivery stage and at the coronial investigation stage after Hannah and her three children died. As Guardian Australia has reported in itsBroken trust investigation, Elsie alleges thatpolice failed to document on their QPrime systemthe non-lethal strangulation, stalking and suspected child grooming Hannah reported to her domestic violence liaison officer. Non-lethal strangulation is a crime and indicates that a person is seven times more likely to die at the hands of their partner. Police officers at the coronial death review stage also acted as officers in the service delivery stage to Hannah and the children and effectively investigated themselves. Police investigating the murders were also investigating the“veracity and motive”of Hannah’s reports of domestic violence.I say to my clients that my job isn’t to understand what they are blowing the whistle about, because it is impossible to become a subject matter expert and assess whether wrongdoing has occurred. They are the expert in their role and if they believe there has been wrongdoing, my job is to help them navigate safe disclosure pathways to help inform regulators or complaints bodies of wrongdoing. When those bodies fail to take action, whistleblowers can consider protected pathways with media or parliamentarians.Pregnant and frightened, Kardell Lomas begged for help. Police found her body in the boot of a carRead moreWith Elsie it was different. From our first call I immediately understood the significance of what she was saying and the weight of her allegations. It made me feel sick. I remembered the murders and the questions I had asked myself at the time. And now this whistleblower told me that there were opportunities that may have saved Hannah and her children – but police had allegedly failed each time.Since the Guardian has published its Broken trust series I have seen thousands of online shares, media articles and comments from readers saying, “Keep Going @guardianaustralia”, because they want to know the truth. This is what was going through my head every time I had a call with Elsie. When she was exhausted, I would think, “Keep going, people need to hear this, even though I know you aren’t sleeping.” When she was in tears, I thought that if she could just keep going it would be worth it, because I knew women and children deserve better and that, when people learned what had taken place, they would demand accountability.Instead, I assured her that she could stop at any time. My job isn’t to push a client into speaking up, it’s to assist when and iftheywant to. She kept going. Despite her struggles and our broken whistleblowing laws – which make whistleblowers think speaking up is a crime – she kept going.I cannot overstate the personal toll this whistleblowing journey took on Elsie. She told me that she has carried this aching heaviness around for years, and her demands for accountability were often dismissed by managers or department heads as her inability to cope with the distressing subject matter.When she escalated her complaints and went to the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) in Queensland, it refused to investigate her allegations because they related to “police misconduct” rather than “corrupt conduct” and were not serious enough to result in criminal charges or sacking.Every “decision to not investigate” is a blow that knocks a whistleblower to the ground. The risk is so enormous every time they speak up – they shouldn’t have to do it time and time again.So, as I reflect on the impact of the Broken trust series, I’m asking: where was everyone? How come only Elsie, the police whistleblower Kate Pausina, the reporter Ben Smee and the Guardian stood up and demanded more from our police, support agencies and coronial systems? The burden of our institutions’ integrity and women’s safety cannot solely rest on the shoulders of whistleblowers and journalists.Yet, were it not for them, the public would not know what really happened in the case of Hannah Clarke and her children. There would be no outrage over how police failed to protectGail Karranwhen they didn’t alert her they were releasing her husband drunk from the watch house on the night she sustained 105 blows. There would be no heart-wrenching revelation that the police and government agencies failed to take seriously the 24 attempts and the noteKardell Lomaspassed to support services pleading for safety. Pleas which may have saved her, before she was murdered at six months pregnant and discarded in the boot of a car.Kardell Lomas’s heartbreaking apology to police is a moment that should shame all Australians | Amy McQuireRead moreIt makes you wonder what other wrongdoing may be occurring, with organisations closing ranks and entrenched cultures of acceptance. It makes you wonder what truth is lost when whistleblowers can’t keep going and are worn out from the fight.It has been a hugely emotional week for me reading the public’s responses to the Guardian’s reporting. The responses seem to fall in two camps: well-placed fury and deep sadness. I knew this information was coming out and yet to see it out in the world, to see everything my client and others fought for, has been overwhelming. I cannot imagine how it feels to be Elsie – to have been gaslit then vindicated in this way. I have carried around this information, secondhand, for only a fraction of th time she did, and it has affected me deeply.Working on this case has been one of the greatest privileges of my career because I bore witness to the staunch fearlessness of Elsie. She went up against managers, police, courts and oversight agencies to demand better for the women and children we have lost. I only hope the next whistleblower is believed and doesn’t go through what she did.To other whistleblowers,keep going.Regina Featherstone is a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre’s Whistleblower Project, Australia’s first specialist legal service for whistleblowersIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis on 13 11 14 and the nationalfamily violence counselling serviceis on 1800 737 732.

Taking the reins with the authority of a nation that is serious about its global impact would only heighten his capacity to drive global ambition and champion our neighbours’ interests.An even bigger challenge for those of us seeking more decisive climate action could be the increasing competition among the phalanx of existential risks – pandemic, nuclear warfare, sentient AI and unparalleled inequality.Kemp argues that these are not standalone challenges. They create a poly-crisis where each feeds the other; climate collapse drives displacement, AI guzzles energy while powering inequality, 10,000 nuclear warheads are stockpiled as the temperature rises.“These threats are not unavoidable,” he writes, “they are consciously created by powerful groups who profit handsomely from the endeavour. Global catastrophic risk is the product of the worldwide system of extraction: the Global Goliath.”A final poll question illustrates how the climate crisis has been subsumed by this maelstrom of interconnected disasters; not so much ignored but now one of many things to doomscroll about.How concerned are you about the following existential threats?It is only the possibility of a meteor strike, arguably the sole act of God on the list, where people’s concern levels are under control. When it comes to Goliath-induced catastrophes, we are on high alert.Amid all this doom, Kemp’s study of fallen empires concludes that Goliaths contain the seeds of their own demise, cursed by the very qualities that give them power; the unsustainability of their domination and the destruction of the resources they plunder.How can Australia convince the world to give up fossil fuels if Anthony Albanese is contradicting himself on gas expansion? | Bill HareRead moreProjecting the trajectory of existential risk beyond the life of current horizons, say 100 years, one of two things must happen: the Goliathsself-terminateor we find a way to work together and slay the giant.Kemp’s prognosis is that we recognise that governments have been captured by the Goliaths and organise ourselves into an army of Davids, redistributing power through open democracy and citizen juries.While this seems like a massive leap from our moment of powerlessness, there are green shoots appearing. Last weekI releaseda paper in collaboration with some terrific academics under the auspices of theAustralian Resilience Democracy Network, looking at efforts to use technology to give citizens a greater say in decisions that affect our futures.Our research shows how there are nascent attempts to embed citizens into decision making by re-plumbing democracy, flattening hierarchies and constructing more dynamic feedback loops that have real consequence.Whether it’s the rollout of renewables, the diffusion of AI, the provision of services or the future of the planet, we need to wrest back control before we all give up hope. Because when there are no more Davids, then Goliath has really won.Peter Lewis is the executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that undertook research for Labor in the last election and conducts qualitative research for Guardian Australia.

His shocking investigation into the relationship between art and life featured two brothers under interrogation for the torture and murder of children. One is a writer whose stories are summarised by an investigator as: “A hundred and one ways to skewer a fucking five-year-old.”Rego, then a 69-year-old grandmother as well as a world famous artist, had been taken to see the play at the NationalTheatrein London by one of her daughters, who knew it would resonate with her. “The brutality and beauty and humour rang very true and like something I had known all my life,” she wrote to McDonagh. “I am actually Portuguese, although I have lived in London for 50 years, and our stories are brusque and cruel like yours.”‘She was drawn to the idea that your foibles could feed off you like parasites’The Pillowman is set in a totalitarian state in which people’s imagination is ruthlessly policed. When Rego was growing up, Portugal was under the dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar, who controlled a deeply conservative society for more than three decades with the help of his secret police. Her identification with the play was so strong that she had gone so far as to make her own “pillowman”, a life-size doll made of cushions stuffed into old tights, as the model for the central panel of a triptych that was to beexhibited at Tate Britainthat autumn.View image in fullscreenCushions stuffed into tights ... the life-size Pillowman that Rego made in the studio that is now her archive.Photograph: Nick Willing/© Estate of Paula Rego. Courtesy Ostrich Arts Ltd and Cristea Roberts GallerySo began an excitable, almost childlike correspondence that culminated in McDonagh ransacking his bottom drawer for more stories she could use, while floating the idea of a more formal collaboration on a picture book in the future. “Finally,” he wrote in February 2005, “I’m sending you some stories. Now listen, they were written quite a few years ago and some are very young and silly and none of them are well written. But some of them have interesting images, maybe, so if anything takes your fancy let me know.” He wouldn’t be able to do anything for a while, he added, because he was off to New York to restage The Pillowman on Broadway.Rego’s pillowman, his bulgy hippopotamus head flopping on his chest above white wellington boots, still lounges on a grubby sofa in the north London studio that has become her archive since her death in 2022. Under the spell of a place where so much great work was made, it feels as if he’s keeping watch while the artworks inspired by McDonagh’s stories are bundled up for exhibition at London’s Cristea Roberts Gallery.The show focuses on a three-year period of Rego’s output, from 2005 to 2007, when she developed a practice of drawing and painting from scenarios that she assembled in her studio with the help of her assistant,Lila Nunes, who also posed for many of them. Though Rego didn’t consider these constructions to be art in their own right, neither did she discard them when their work was done. Some of the puppets involved, which she calledbonecos– the Portuguese word for dolls – will be on display for the first time.View image in fullscreenDisturbing … Adam Godley and David Tennant in The Pillowman.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyAt the heart of this output was the “McDonagh series”, based on the stories that McDonagh himself explains were written in his 20s, more as the outlines of a potential short film series than as publishable pieces of work. The only time they had previously seen the light of day was when he showed a few of them to the Pillowman cast as examples of the sorts of stories under investigation in the play.The imaginative connection between the mature artist and the young playwright and film-maker – whose work has since gone on to sweep up awards on both sides of the Atlantic – is startlingly powerful, and ranges from a typewriting monkey to a man with turtles for hands. It doesn’t follow straight lines. But of the four stories that Rego chose from the dozens she was sent, one in particular drove straight to the heart of one of her own enduring obsessions.The story involved a forest full of babies calling piteously out to the conscience of the mother who had aborted them. “It is a very perverse story, against what I stand for, so I don’t know why I did it,” she wrote at the time. There is no forest in the paintings she made in response. In one, a woman is slumped in a bathroom with fancy floral wallpaper, a foetus in her lap. In another, a young mother cradling a baby sits on a toilet with the bloody remnants of an abortion in a bowl at her feet.View image in fullscreen‘I’m sending you some stories. Some are very silly and none of them are well written’ … Martin McDonagh.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The GuardianAs an art student at London’s Slade in the early 1950s, Rego had several backstreet abortions herself, before returning to her family home in Portugal to give birth to her first daughter, in a society hellbent on outlawing young women like her. She felt no guilt, she recalled; merely anger about the unnecessary pain, misery and danger inflicted. It was a subject to which she would return time and again, in artworks that would play a part in galvanising the Portuguese people to overthrow their country’s ban on abortion.In a film,Secrets & Stories, made by her son Nick Willing towards the end of her life, Rego talked about her outrage after the decriminalisation of abortion was rejected in a 1998 referendum. When a second referendum was scheduled for 2007, she printed up eight etchings for distribution to the national and local press. The Portuguese president at the time, Jorge Sampaio, is among those who testify in the film to the works’ role in changing public opinion.Although Rego rarely made appearances in her own paintings, the autobiographical content is there for those who know what to look for, according to Willing – whose responsibilities for his mother’s legacy include caring for an archive of several thousand works, overseeing 23 exhibitions around the world this year, and looking after a museum, theCasa das Histórias Paula Rego, which was founded in 2009 near her old family home.View image in fullscreenPersonal traumas … Rego in her London studio in 2004.Photograph: Independent/AlamyFor all its apparent grotesquery, Pillowman personifies Rego’s affection for her industrialist father, who brought his family up on aquinta– country estate – on the Portuguese riviera, where their neighbours included celebrities and royalty. The triptych contains references toSaint-Exupéry’s Little Prince, and to the exiled king of Italy, who was known to pick up young male sex workers on the beach.After her father’s death, the family’s electronics business went bust and thequintahad to be sold – a traumatic series of events that is dramatised in another picture from the McDonagh series. The story it is based on tells of a piglet’s futile prayers to be saved from slaughter by a scarecrow it had earlier rescued from a wildfire. Rego represents the scarecrow as a crucified woman with a cow’s skull, who towers above a decapitated pig’s head, next to a sleeping girl. In the background the sky is burning. As a child, says Willing, Rego was traumatised by the slaughter of a pig she had come to love. The sleeping girl represents her guilt at allowing her whole inheritance to go up in flames, although the fault wasn’t in fact hers but her husband’s. Victor Willing, who had been a star student at the Slade when they met, disastrously thought he could run the family business himself. Its failure forced Rego to beg for grants to keep their young family afloat.View image in fullscreenMysterious works … Rego’s Camouflaged Hands, 2006.Photograph: © Estate of Paula Rego. Courtesy Ostrich Arts Ltd and Cristea Roberts GalleryThe most mysterious picture to emerge from the McDonagh collaboration is the one with a man who has turtles in place of hands. Willing is reluctant to overexplain it, because Rego never explained it to him. But he believes it has something to do with the lifelong depression from which she suffered, as her beloved father had before her. “I think she was very drawn to the idea that the things that weigh you down – like depression or all your foibles and idiosyncrasies – they’re part of you, but they’re also living creatures that feed off you, like parasites. They are a curse but also a privilege and, in getting rid of them, you perish,” he says.Flying mermaids and moonlit dancers – Paula Rego: a life in picturesRead moreThe three years on which the exhibition focuses were among the most productive of Rego’s life, says Willing, resulting in an enormous number of pastels and prints. “She had a particularly purple patch with theMartin McDonaghstories, and he gets a lot of credit for exciting in my mother perhaps her most accomplished work.”The picture book sadly never materialised. “It would’ve been a dream, though I think that dream was mostly in my head,” says McDonagh. “But to be a tiny part of the art of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century is mind-blowing to me. I still can’t really believe it.”Paula Rego: Drawing from Life is atCristea Roberts Gallery, London, from 27 November to 17 January.

But they were dancing together – two beings in the afternoon sunlight, having their own conversation’Interview byCharlotte JansenWed 26 Nov 2025 09.54 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 12.13 ESTShareIam an only child. My father was killed in a car accident when I was 14 and my mother was 47. We were really tightly bonded after that. She worked at a university and was an artist: she painted and carved birds. She was a wonderful person, who lit up a room and was someone everyone wanted to be around. She was very giving.Later in life, she developed dementia. I left my teaching position to stay home and look after her. She was very active – she would go outside and rip up bulbs, put the horses in the wrong stalls. It was very stressful to come home – I would enter the driveway and think: “Oh my word!”I didn’t have any previous experience of dementia, and I was thinking it wouldn’t be for long – but of course it was. The first year was slow. She would say she was losing her mind, and it made her sad. I got depressed too and stopped making pictures. To photograph my mother felt like sacrilege. I thought it would be voyeuristic. Then a friend, Joni, who also knew her, set me a challenge to take my mother’s picture. I turned to my mother on the couch and said: “We’re going to make a picture for Joni.” Then she did a remarkable thing: she turned to face the window and fluffed up her hair. That shocked me. She said: “Why not – what else are we doing?” That changed everything.I got up in the night and she had moved the fridge, stacked the chairs on the couch, and was walking around nudeShe used to love being outside and we would go out whenever possible to make pictures. This image is of our dog – whom my mother wasn’t very fond of – a jack russell. Skipper loved the hose. My mother came out and they were dancing together, two beings in the sunlight of the afternoon, having their own conversation. Beautiful things like that just kept unfolding. It made the sadness and depression lessen for me.As the dementia developed, my mother would say she wanted to die, and ask me to take her there, as though it was a place we could travel to. We had a surreal life together for a few years. I couldn’t think about losing her; it never occurred to her she was also losing me. I remember her dancing to a Dolly Parton song, swaying her hips, and she was so beautiful it stopped me in my tracks. I was crying, watching and remembering her as my mother. She came over and gave me a big hug and said: “What are you crying about?”If I feel sadness, I feel there’s an equal amount of love – that’s been a helpful form of self-preservation. I couldn’t make pictures of the stained bedsheets and dark closets. This, with sunlight and happiness, is a very curated point of view – a lot has been omitted deliberately. The title of the book, Calling the Birds Home, comes from a day when I felt I couldn’t take on another thing: I got up in the middle of the night and she had moved the refrigerator to the middle of the room and stacked the chairs on the couch, and was walking around nude. I was so overwhelmed, I had to just throw my hands up, acknowledge our place within the universe and ask for support.Once she passed, five years ago, I discovered how much I missed nurturing and taking care of someone. The mother-daughter roles had been reversed. She was such a great mother, she made our life together as beautiful as possible throughout my childhood and beyond.When I started to share the pictures, it shifted to a universal experience – yes, it’s dire, but what I did with her was a new way to have a conversation when we were losing our ability to express our love. It helped us through a dark time. The pictures were secondary to that. She blossomed all the time for these pictures, she was up for it – that was part of her nature, and it didn’t change with dementia. I wish we could look at hard topics and also think about how to get through them. I hope this work helps motivate someone to break through the sadness and go and do something with someone they love.Calling the Birds Home is published by L’ArtiereView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Cheryle St OngeCheryle St Onge’s CVBorn:Worcester, MassachusettsHigh point:“The day I bought my first 8x10 view camera.

But once I started to work with this old Deardorff, the process forced me to slow down, I allowed myself time to think and imagine – my work shifted and I never looked back.”Top tip:“Be organised, keep a sketch book, find a posse of fellow artists to share and discuss work.

The TV series was broadcast at prime time on both sides of the Atlantic, and ABC in the US even changed its name to ABeatlesC in its honour. The three accompanying albums (the first time the Beatles had allowed outtakes from their recording sessions to be officially released) sold in their millions. Its success helped kickstart the latterday Beatles industry, a steady stream of officially sanctioned documentaries, reissues, remixes, compilations and expanded editions, predicated on two ideas: that the Beatles’ archive contains fathomless bounty; and that the band’s story is so rich there’s no limit to the number of times it can fruitfully be retold in fresh light.For a while, those ideas seemed to hold true, but recently, it’s been hard not to think the Beatles’ Apple Corps might be trying to feed an insatiable appetite for content from an increasingly bare cupboard. You can marvel at the highlights of Peter Jackson’s TV series Get Back and still wonder whether the director wasn’t stretching his material a little thin; whether nearly eight hours of it – plus a separate Imax film of the Beatles’ final live performance on the roof of Apple’s London HQ,anda reissue ofthe original 1970 Let It Bedocumentary – might have been rather too much of a good thing.Last year’sMartin Scorsese-produced Beatles ’64, meanwhile, just re-edited familiar footage – much of it from the Maysles Brothers’ 1964 documentary, What’s Happening! The Beatles in the USA, reissued in 1991 as The First US Visit, then again by Apple in 2004 – and spliced it with new interviews that suggested everything that needed to be said about the events of 1964 had already been said, and the two surviving Beatles had run out of new angles on a subject they had been answering questions about for 60 years.A similar sense of pointlessness attends the new version of Anthology. It arrives with a fourth album of outtakes, but 23 of its 36 tracks have been previously released, which means vinyl buyers are being asked to cough up nearly 70 quid for 50 minutes of “new” music, most of which is pretty inconsequential to all but the most banzai Fabs devotee. There’sno sign of Carnival of Light, the near-mythic Stockhausen-influenced experiment the band recorded during the Sgt Pepper sessions, nor the fabled 27-minute version of Helter Skelter. Instead, you have to make do with a wobbly first take of their cover of Carl Perkins’ Matchbox.View image in fullscreenRock aristocracy … George Martin, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and George Harrison in The Beatles Anthology.Photograph: PRThere’s also an “all-new” episode of the TV series, concentrating on the making of the original Anthology documentary and Free as a Bird and Real Love, the twoJohn Lennondemos the surviving members worked up into songs in the mid-90s. These events are now as far in the past as Beatlemania was when the Anthology series was produced: bizarrely, the footage from 30 years ago – a riot of ponytails, mullets, leather waistcoats and stonewashed denim – looks more dated than that from the 60s, the clothes sported by 90s rock aristocrats having yet to pass into the realm of classic style.The problem is, the new episode isn’t all-new at all. It’s essentially the bonus material from the 2003 DVD edition of Anthology padded out to 50 minutes: the three surviving Beatles being interviewed together at George Harrison’s home and at Abbey Road, loosely jamming old rock’n’roll songs – and an early McCartney effort, Thinking of Linking – on acoustic guitars and ukuleles; working on the new tracks at Paul McCartney’s home studio with producer Jeff Lynne; and sitting at a mixing desk while George Martin plays them multitrack recordings from the 60s.Some of the footage is sweet – there’s a lovely moment where Ringo addresses his bandmates with a plaintive “I like hanging out with you guys” – and some of it is oddly telling: you could divine a lot from George Harrison’s visible exasperation as the sessions for Free as a Bird and Real Love drag on. (Off camera, he famously refused to work on a third Lennon demo, Now and Then, deeming it “fucking rubbish”. McCartney and Starr eventually finished the track in 2023, 22 years after Harrison’s death.)McCartney has a funny story about getting Abbey Road’s recalcitrant engineers to keep working on Beatles sessions past their allotted hours by covertly dosing the studio’s tea urn with amphetamines. It’s nice to see them together and more or less happy, although you can’t miss a certain tension between Harrison and McCartney. When Martin plays the multitrack of the latter’s You Never Give Me Your Money, Harrison suggests it sounds “a bit cheesy”. McCartney is noticeably unamused.None of it is essential or particularly insightful. Like the Anthology 4 album, it’s been flammed together to suggest added value, that there’s something new to say about a subject that may well have been exhausted.The Beatles Anthology is on Disney+ now.

They talk about manipulating their audience – and correcting historyFlorence HallettWed 26 Nov 2025 09.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 11.52 ESTShareSomerset House in London used to be known as the “national beehive”, says artist and film-makerOnyeka Igwe, as she leads the way through corridors and down stone steps to her studio in the building’s inner reaches. As the former home of the Inland Revenue, and the General Register Office responsible for recording births, deaths and marriages, Somerset House once held all the information necessary to tax and manage the population. “There were so many workers here,” Igwe says.Archives are the prosaic raw materials of her films – stories of resistance, dispossession and the power of communal activism for which she and fellow London-born and -based artist, writerand musicianMorgan Quaintancehave been made joint recipients of the2025 Film London Jarman award.Like Igwe, Quaintance is fascinated by history, which surfaces and recedes in his films in the random, apparently illogical way that it does in our individual and collective consciousness. InRepetitions, one of two films commended by the jury of art and film world experts, Quaintance gathers the flotsam and jetsam of 30 years of personal history – a scan of his injured knee, feet on a staircase, a crouching boy – mixing them with footage of Black feminist activists from a century ago, and the voice of a campaigner for workers’ rights during the Covid pandemic.View image in fullscreenSpeculative past … a still from A Radical Duet (2023) by Onyeka Igwe.Photograph: Onyeka IgweInA Radical Duet, Igwe finds the gaps in the history of the burgeoning anticolonial movement in 1940s London, to imagine the meeting of two Black female activists who might have crossed paths. In the spaces left blank by archives, books and blue plaques, Igwe places a speculative past, in a film that draws the threads of history through to the here and now.When we meet, a few days before the announcement, neither Igwe nor Quaintance knows that they have won, but as they have been previously shortlisted, the pair maintain the cool demeanour of old hands.Presented annually, and inspired by the lateDerek Jarman, the award, which includes a £10,000 cash prize, recognises and supports artists working with moving images. This is the first time since its inception in 2008 that the award has been presented jointly, with the prize money split between the two winners.Both artists work across different media, but are equally convinced of the unique power of film: “It’s thriving, it’s vibrant, and some of the best work is happening in this country,” says Quaintance. Igwe, whose current Tate Britain exhibition,Our Generous Mother, includes sculpture, film and projected slides, enjoys film’s capacity to accommodate different forms, but says: “It’s important to know why something is a film, as opposed to an article or a poem.”View image in fullscreen‘Some of the best work is happening in this country’ …  Jarman prize winners  Onyeka Igwe and Morgan Quaintance.While for Igwe, history is an anchor in the present, for Quaintance, it’s a point of friction on which an individual is snagged and forced into an encounter with a much bigger picture. “There’s this new idea that you have to be collectively conscious. You have to be thinking, ‘Where do I stand in relation to world events?’” he says. “We’re all supposed to be on a world vigil, you know? I’m not lamenting it, I’m just fascinated by it. It’s a contemporary condition.”As a medium that perhaps more than any other commands the full and unmediated attention of an audience, and at a time when viewers are more visually sophisticated than ever, film is the ideal way to assess our ability to affect others beyond our immediate circle.Repetitions, a film that stutters and loops like a VHS held on pause, is a testing experience for viewers presented with a deconstructed film in which sound, time and image are separated and distorted. “From a formal perspective, I was interested in how far you can loop something, and what that does to a viewer,” Quaintance says. “Maybe I can push you into a hypnotic state. I can frustrate you, or make you have a sense of expectation, or push you towards boredom. These are all things that are going to actively manipulate you as you’re watching something.”Asked about future plans that might be brought into being with the prize money, Quaintance points to his exhibition Available Light, at Chelsea Space in London, in which a film serves as the central point of a bigger touring project about the difficulties of modern urban living. For Igwe, an adaptation of a Doris Lessing novel, and the next chapter of A Radical Duet are calling her.But it’s their interest in grassroots activism that’s at the root of their shared passion for the English civil war. For Igwe, it began at school, when she realised that “people had these proto-communist ideas, they were thinking about alternative, radical ways of living that people are still thinking about today. That sparked an interest in thinking about the present through history.”“I would love to direct a drama on the English civil war,” says Quaintance. “I’d like to do something like Steve McQueen’s Small Axe tracking from the civil war to today.” It might be the ideal way to invest their shared winnings.Onyeka Igwe: Our Generous Motheris at Tate Britain, London, until 17 May.Morgan Quaintance: Available Lightis at Chelsea Space, London, until 12 December.The work of all the shortlisted nominees can be seen at Whitechapel Gallery, London, until 14 December.Explore more on these topicsArtJarman awardDerek JarmanAwards and prizesTate BritainfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Almost 20 years ago (on 1 December 2005, to be precise), I was at my very first video game console launch party somewhere around London’s Leicester Square. The Xbox 360 arrived on 22 November 2005 in the US and 2 December in the UK, about three months after I got my first job as a junior staff writer on GamesTM magazine. My memories of the night are hazy because a) it was a worryingly long time ago and b) there was a free bar, but I do remember that DJ Yoda played to a tragically deserted dancefloor, and everything was very green. My memories of the console itself, however, and the games I played on it, are still as clear as anXbox Crystal. It is up there withthe greatest consolesever.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In 2001, the first Xbox had muscled in on a scene dominated byJapanese consoles, upsetting the established order (it outsold Nintendo’s GameCube by a couple of million) and dragging console gaming into the online era with Xbox Live, an online multiplayer service that was leagues ahead of what the PlayStation 2 was doing. Nonetheless, the PS2 ended up selling over 150m to the original Xbox’s 25m. The Xbox 360, on the other hand, would sell over 80m, neck and neck with the PlayStation 3 for most of its eight-year life cycle (and well ahead in the US). It turned Xbox from an upstart into a market leader.In a very un-Microsoft way, the Xbox 360 was cool. Its design was interesting, an inwards double curve described by its designers as an “inhale”, with a swappable front faceplate. It had a memorably Y2K startup animation and clean, futuristic menus that brought messaging, friends lists and music. I remember finding Microsoft’s marketing powerfully cringe at the time – witness thisdeveloper video, featuring former Microsoft entertainment boss J Allard and his infamous earring, in which a guy juggles while saying the words “Three symmetric cores”. But, despite that, the machine they built felt modern and exciting. The controller, too, white with its pops of colour, was such a tremendous improvement on the uncomfortably gigantic original Xbox controller that it’s become a design standard. I know people who will still only use wired Xbox 360 pads to play PC games.Powerfully cringe … Microsoft’s Xbox 360 promo video.As the first properly, seamlessly connected console, it brought a lot of things together to form a sense of gamer identity: playing different games online under one unified gamertag; messages and social features, as well as the inspired idea of achievements, which created a personal gaming history via the little challenges you completed in everything you played. (Sony would soon copy this with trophies.) Attaching a number to this, the gamerscore, was devilish genius, encouraging players to compete for ultimately meaningless clout, and creating a powerful incentive for people to stick with the console rather than buying games elsewhere. TheXbox360 was the first console to understand that people stay where their friends are. If you had the choice between buying a game on PS3 or 360, you’d choose 360 because that’s where everyone else was playing.By late 2006, when a complacent Sony released an overpriced and awkward-looking follow-up to the PlayStation 2, the Xbox 360 had already had a year to convert people to its vision for high-definition gaming. People had already built up a collection of games and an online identity that was tied to Xbox. The big third-party game publishers, who found the PS3’s proprietary technology awkward to develop for, had started to prioritise Xbox for multi-platform games. The 360 never cracked Japan, but in the rest of the world it became the default console, an extraordinary thing for Microsoft to achieve considering how comprehensively Sony had dominated the previous two generations with the PlayStation.View image in fullscreenThe weird, monochrome realm of Limbo.Photograph: TriplePointXbox Live Arcade also helped to usher in the modern era of indie games. Between the 90s and the late 00s, publishers and bricks-and-mortar retailers largely controlled which games did and didn’t make it into players’ hands, especially on consoles. In 2008, Xbox Live Arcade started letting people download smaller, cheaper games direct to their consoles – no shop or publisher required. It did for console gaming what Steam would later do on PC, getting players comfortable with the idea of digital distribution. Games released via the arcade includedGeometry Wars, Braid, Limbo, Bastion and, just as importantly, the best-ever digital version of Uno. I remember sinking many, many hours into Oblivion, Mass Effect and BioShock in my late teens, but I also eagerly awaited each new batch of Xbox Live Arcade games.Looking back, the architects of the Xbox 360 really understood how and why people played games, and what they wanted from a next-generation console at the time. They understood how the internet could transform not just multiplayer gaming, but the social experience around games, and the way people found and bought them. This knowledge was apparently lost in a few short years, because when Microsoft announced the Xbox One in 2013, it was an absolute shitshow. By then, Microsoft apparently thought that people wanted to play games while watching sports picture-in-picture, as a mandatory connected camera watched your every move.Microsoft has never again come close to market leadership in video games. A resurgent Sony took all the best lessons from the Xbox 360 and packaged them into the PlayStation 4, and then the Nintendo Switch arrived in 2018 and blew everything else out of the water. With Xbox now in distant third place in the waning console wars, it seems to see its future as aquasi-monopolistic video game subscription service, rather than a hardware maker. Series that defined the 360 era, such as Halo and Gears of War, are now playable on PC and PlayStation. Others, such as Fable, have been languishing for over a decade.The 360 era was an exciting time in games, a period of great change and competition brought about by online gaming. The console market was a lot smaller back then, but also less predictable. There was still room for those “interesting, 7/10” B-games that sometimes proved even more memorable than the blockbusters when free-to-play games were not yet a thing – games were yet to consolidate into the five established mega-franchises that now dominate everything. And, in bringing indie games to console players, it genuinely changed the trajectory of my gaming taste.What to playView image in fullscreenBath your grain … Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved.Photograph: Bizarre Creations/SteamWriting about Xbox Live Arcade had me hankering forGeometry Wars: Retro Evolved, the spectacularly compulsive Xbox Live Arcadetop-down shooterthat looks like fireworks and feels like a sensory bath for your brain.

Maybe there’s more to come …Stuart HeritageWed 26 Nov 2025 09.56 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 13.42 ESTShareSo far,Donald Trump’scontrolof themediahas involved a lot more stick than carrot. Thanks to a combination of outbursts and indiscriminate legal threats, the powerful figures at the centre of a rapidly consolidating industry find themselves with little option but to bend to the president’s every demand. Unfortunately, what he’s demanding is Rush Hour 4.Just a few days ago, this seemed like a weird overreach, like when Trump used a keynote speech at a McDonald’s todemand more tartare sauceon Filet-O-Fish sandwiches. But in this case it really happened. Trump told majority Paramount Skydance shareholder Larry Ellison that he wished someone would make Rush Hour 4, and nowRush Hour 4 is being made.Rush Hour 4 in the works at Paramount after reports of Trump interveningRead moreSo now we find ourselves in a situation where the president of the United States is dictating the sort of films that should be made. The problem with this, of course, is that Trump has famously awfultaste in movies.You know this already. What sort of figure can look out across the entire spectrum of cinema and decide that the thing that most deserves to be made is the third sequel to Rush Hour, starring a septuagenarianJackie Chan? Was there even a third Rush Hour film? Who knows.View image in fullscreenBolo Yeung and Jean-Claude Van Damme in Bloodsport.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyBut other signs were there. Famously, one of Trump’s most beloved films is the 1988 Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts movie Bloodsport. Even more famously, his favoured way to enjoy it involvesforcing one of his sons to fast-forwardthrough the exposition so that he can just watch the bits where people get kicked in the face. Then there’s also his critique of Citizen Kane to consider, in which he forgets all the stuff about the isolation of wealth andsuggeststhat Charles Foster Kane should “get a different woman”.Trump wants to revive the Rush Hour franchise. Is he eyeing a return to Hollywood?Read moreAgain, at the time this all just seemed like a bit of silliness. This is a man who appears to have filled the Oval Office with spray-painted home decor moldings, so of course his taste in film is bad. But now it’s completely evident that what Trump wants, Trump gets. In other words, brace yourself for the second coming of gormless action flicks.Trump’s approval of the Rush Hour series is already an indication that he only likes the bad Jackie Chan films. Not for him the hyper-kinetic ballet of Police Story or Armour of God; he much prefers the ones where Chan has to deliberately dumb himself down for western audiences who chew popcorn with their mouths open.And that means that, now that Trump has Chan right where he wants him, it is only a matter of time before he demands a sequel to Shanghai Noon, the western comedy he made 25 years ago with Owen Wilson. And, sure, technically there already was a sequel to that – the London-set Shanghai Knights – but that was too fancy. Forget it was ever made and do another kung-fu cowboy film, by presidential decree.And surely Trump’s love of Bloodsport means that a Van Dammeissance is due. Let’s have a Timecop 2. Let’s have a second Double Impact where the Van Damme twins discover a secret triplet. Let’s have a fourth Cyborg. Let’s have a fifth Universal Soldier. I realise that the original was a Steven Seagal film, but let’s make a sequel to 2002’s Half Past Dead starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Let’s call it Quarter to Dead. This is what the American people deserve.You’re really spoiling us: Trump miscasts Gibson, Stallone and Voight by making them mere ambassadorsRead moreOf course, this would only be the starter for something that Trump has been slowly piecing together for a while now. Remember back in January, when Trumpmade Sylvester Stallone a special ambassadorto Hollywood? Do you think he did this because he truly thinks that Stallone has enough heft to encourage more US-based film production? Or, as I suspect, did he do it because he is desperate to see Tango & Cash 2 rushed into production?It has to be the latter. You could set a million quantum computers to work for a decade, and they would all agree that, whichever way you look at it, Tango & Cash is Trump’s favourite Stallone film. It’s not Rambo, because that series started with too much liberal hand-wringing. It’s not Rocky, because that series started with the hero losing. No, it has to be Tango & Cash.Like Trump, Tango & Cash is from the 80s. Like Trump, it has a funny name. Like Trump, it was hated by the critics but loved by enough of a bewilderingly large percentage of the population to turn a profit. Tango & Cash is everything that Trump wants in a film. It’s dumb. It’s violent. It barely makes sense. Nobody has ever clamoured for a sequel to Tango & Cash but, mark my words, we will have one by the time Trump leaves office.Explore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsDonald TrumpJackie ChanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We did Elephant Stone and they were lovely. Then as Manchester turned into Madchester I got to know them really well. I went to the great gig they did in Blackpool; I went to Spike Island. It was a fantastic time to be together and the Haçienda was the glue. There was no VIP area in the club, so punters would walk around and think: “There’s Mani!”View image in fullscreenPeter Hook.Photograph: Bass Guitar Magazine/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesI had the Roses in my Suite 16 studio doing demos for what was going to be the second album, until they scrapped it. I got to know Mani and his wife, Imelda. We had a wild period. Then after our various bands stopped playing live we startedFreebass, with three bass players: myself, Mani and Andy Rourke, who’d been in the Smiths. The band was ill-fated – too many chefs – and eventually we fell out badly after a row over a gig.Mani slagged me offbut God bless him, the very next day he phoned me up andapologised. That was Mani. Once we were no longer working together, we became friends and after that every day spent with him was a total pleasure.When people say Mani could be a clown or joker, it isn’t the right word. Yes, he was very entertaining. He was a man of the people, very funny and very irreverent. But he also had an intensity and didn’t suffer fools gladly. He was very passionate about things he believed in, whether Man United or standing up for his mates. If he felt something was wrong, or there was some sort of injustice, he was very tenacious. Once you had Mani on your side, you were rocking. He was a fighter and never gave an inch but he was everybody’s friend and nobody had a bad word about him.When the Roses reformed, he was desperate for it to be like it was at the start – it broke his heart when it wasn’tWhen he was on form, he was a wonderful soul. He’d been too young to be a mod so always had a thing about scooters. One day he came to my house with one of those “human cannonball” crash helmets on and looked like Crazy Frog. An hour later I heard this strange noise and it was Mani, kicking his flooded scooter, because it was a wet day and the moisture had got in the engine. He must have kicked that scooter for an hour and a half but then, incredibly, it started. That’s the magic of the man: he never let anything beat him.From a bass-playing point of view, he was the best. Everybody wanted to be him. Mani joining the Stone Roses made the difference. He was a groove artist and into groovy music. I recently watched him playing Fool’s Gold on Instagram and thought: “How is he playing that?” Like Andy Rourke, Mani played very melodically – which I do, but Mani was much subtler. I always tried to compete with the guitar but Mani wove around it. That’s a great skill, but I didn’t care what he played. He could have banged the thing on the floor for all I care: he was Mani.He was in two of the coolest bands of all time: the Stone Roses andPrimal Scream. I actually auditioned for the Primals and they said I was too much like New Order, so when Mani got the job he was straight on the phone to me. “Hey No 2” – he always called me No 2 – “it’s No 1 here.” Rourkey was “No 3”: the level of banter between the three of us was amazing.View image in fullscreen‘The music he DJ’d reflected his bass playing’ … Mani DJing in 2003.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesAll Mani wanted to do was play and most of all he loved playing to people. When the Roses reformed, he was desperate for it to be like it was at the start and it broke his heart when it wasn’t. But it was nice after all they’d been through, financially and otherwise, that they got that final payday that enabled him and Imelda to have a lovely life. Once they got their boys, they were absolutely made up. They were a great little family.Mani’s writhing, relentless bass was the Stone Roses’ secret sauce – it taught indie kids how to dance | Alexis PetridisRead moreWhen he was no longer playing, he started DJing and the music he played reflected his bass playing: funk and soul. He never stopped working and was so looking forward to the speaking tour he’d just announced. It’s heartbreaking that he’s gone before it started and my heart breaks for those two boys, losing both their parents so soon after each other.The outpouring of grief and sadness when Mani died has been really quite remarkable. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it, for a pop star, certainly not for a long time. At the moment every Manchester legend is asking themselves “Will I get that when I die?” But I can safely say that Mani will never be forgotten.As told to Dave SimpsonExplore more on these topicsMusicStone RosesPrimal ScreamPeter HookfeaturesShareReuse this content"

French drama The Hunt was due to be released on 3 December, but it has been hit by allegations of similarity to a 1976 film adaptation of a novel, Shoot.The Hunt stars Cannes and three-time César award winner Benoît Magimel and two-time César winner Mélanie Laurent, who has featured in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds. But press releases about The Hunt, as well as its official trailers, have now been removed from Apple’s site.“The broadcast of our series The Hunt has been temporarily postponed,” said production company Gaumont in a statement. “We are currently conducting a thorough review to address any questions related to our production. We take intellectual property matters very seriously.”According to a press release sent out by Apple, The Hunt (known in French as À l’Ombre des Forêts) follows Franck (Magimel) and his longtime friends, who spend weekends hunting – until they find themselves targeted by another group of hunters, who are seemingly stalking them even after they return from their trip.Shoot, the work which The Hunt has been accused of bearing similarities to, was a thriller written by Douglas Fairbairn in 1973, and was turned into a US/Canadian movie starring Cliff Robertson and Ernest Borgnine. The synopsis of the plot on Goodreads is as follows:Rex is an uber-macho hunter who, together with four equally testosterone-addled buddies, embarks on a hunting trip in the Canadian wilderness. But their weekend is cut short by a rival band of hunters they encounter in the forest, one of whom inexplicably takes a potshot at Rex’s party and grazes the head of one of his buddies. Another of Rex’s friends returns fire, killing the shooter. From there Rex and company scurry off and head back to civilisation. Rex, however, becomes convinced that the dead man’s companions are going to come after him and his friends.According toAppleInsider, which reported the news on Tuesday, the allegations were first reported by French media expert Clément Garin.The Hunt is not the first Apple TV show to have been pulled from launch at short notice this year. Jessica Chastain’s series The Savant waspostponedthree days before its September air date, followingthe shooting of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. The Savant stars Chastain as a top-secret investigator who traces white supremacists and other hate groups online to prevent violent attacks.Its delay prompted Chastain to release an Instagram post stating that she and Apple were “not aligned on the decision to pause the release of The Savant”.“I’ve never shied away from difficult subjects, and while I wish this show wasn’t so relevant, unfortunately it is,” she said. “The Savant is about the heroes who work every day to stop violence before it happens, and honouring their courage feels more urgent than ever.” The show is still without a release date.Apple TV and Gaumont have been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionApple TV+newsShareReuse this content"

She recalls her water being the colour of loo cleaner. Many complaints were made (“Our daughter’s hair has turned green and it’s sticking like glue,” says one phone recording) but the authorities – some speak here, including South West Water authority’s former head of operations – insisted the water was safe.

Embittered, rude, apathetic, resentful of the success and happiness of others and intellectually snobbish, he’s a 48-year-old aspiring writer who makes ends meet, just about, working in an independent bookshop in a gentrifying part of LA.He worries about turning 50 having made nothing of his life. He notes, lugubriously, that he barely seems to get any writing done and that – having no gift for plot, characterisation or prose – the novel he claims to be trying to produce will be lousy anyway. He keeps bumping into old friends whose books are being published by hip independent presses or who have acquired nice girlfriends, or both. His teeth are in bad shape.He rails against the gentrification of the neighbourhood by large corporations and sheeplike hipsters. And he rages, above all, against the customers in the bookshop, who ask him stupid questions, buy copies of trendy books he considers bad, ask for directions to the toilets, insist on paying by credit card, block up the aisles talking noisily on their phones or, worse, attempt to engage him in friendly conversation. He is very rude to all of them, especially the ones with beards, and they complain about him on Yelp, and his boss in turn tells him off, which increases his bitterness.He keeps bumping into old friends whose books are being published or who have acquired nice girlfriends, or bothThat, for more than 300 pages, is about it. The book is a long, very repetitive monologue (we meet versions of the same riff on the annoyingness of addiction memoirs at least three times) which knowingly enacts the tedious stasis of which its narrator complains. It’s not without its moments. I liked, for instance, the sour footnote in which he says: “Rather than me wasting my time inserting the word ‘unfortunately’ into every statement, from now on the reader should just assume it is there.” (Shades of Martin Amis’s “Unless I specifically inform you otherwise, I’m always smoking another cigarette.”)But it doesn’t have the wacky charm ofBlack Booksor the volcanic wit of A Confederacy of Dunces, and I can’t help thinking that its contemporary digs – we meet Ben Lerner,Miranda July,Kim Gordonand Michelle Tea as “Len Berner”, “Samantha August”, “Gordon Kim” and “Michelle Coffee” – will date fast. Plus, that the annoying customers are effectively interchangeable – I lost count of how many asked the way to the loo – is baked into the text. Another footnote says: “I can’t spend hours coming up with a name for a character, especially one that isn’t going to appear again in this book. Bill will have to do.”Yet for all the show of insouciance, Tottenham’s prose is effortful. You get sentences such as: “Most of my contemporaries had moved on and were now established in their professional, creative and familial lives, whereas I had turned a corner and hit a wall, with the contrary values of youth hammered into place: a callow negativism matured to a dubious vintage, with a voluptuous bouquet of regret and a lingering aftertaste of self-disgust.” Parklife!The book that Sean is writing, incidentally, is the book that we are reading. A colleague who works in the coffee shop – called only “the Boy” – persuades our hero to show him the manuscript, and then slightly seems to regret it. I don’t know if Tottenham – an LA-dwelling Brit who has published poetry and exhibited as an artist – has worked in a bookshop, so can’t say if the reflexivity goes a layer deeper still.At one point, Sean discusses giving his narrator a name and says: “I was considering using Sean for his first name but a lot of people seem to dislike that name and it’s too phonetically close to my own name.” Sean may be “phonetically close” to John, but it’s phonetically identical to Sean, which is indeed what Sean is called in the book. This could be a postmodern masterstroke, or it could simply be another “can’t be bothered” shrug.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It manages to be unsubtle without being powerful. His subject isChristy Salters Martin, who under the grinning tutelage of Don King became the world’s most successful female boxing champion in the 90s and 00s but faced a misogynist nightmare outside the ring.Boxing legend Christy Martin: ‘My husband told me for 20 years he would kill me’Read moreThe film fails to deliver the power of the traditional boxing movie, or the real importance of a story about domestic abuse and coercive control, or the sensory detail of true crime. It relies on the simple fact of a woman pioneeringly taking on what had once been solely a man’s sport and relapses into cliche. Christy, with her frizzy hair and brown contact lenses, doesn’t seem to plausibly develop as a character throughout the film, and it sometimes seems as if Michôd is slightly more engaged with her gargoyle of a husband-slash-manager Jim Martin, played byBen Fosterwith a standard-issue combover and paunch.The creepy Martin discovers Christy when she is nothing more than a high-school basketball enthusiast in the 1980s but with an amazing untrained gift for boxing. Christy’s reactionary homophobic mom Joyce is a cartoonish role on which Merritt Wever is wasted; she is intensely suspicious of Christy’s emotional relationships with young women and is delighted when Christy is bullied into accepting a marriage proposal from the overbearing and psychopathically jealous Martin. She effectively becomes complicit in Martin’s horrendous abuse, which involves Christy’s macabre forced participation in private sex bouts with men and porn videos. The growing nightmare of her marital situation runs alongside her increasing dominance of women’s boxing, especially once she is taken up by the shock-haired supremo himself Don King in a scene-stealing cameo from Chad Coleman.The film glides along initially with an unbroken string of euphoric victories for Christy which after a while become tiresome; the record shows that Christy did in fact lose occasionally and losses are how boxers learn and become better at their craft – and it’s also how boxing movies become interesting. It apparently wants to contrast Christy doing well in the ring but taking the punches, literal and otherwise, outside it, and can only just about bring itself to concede that she lost to Laila Ali, daughter of Muhammad Ali. But even here it flinches from actually showing the moment of loss itself.Sweeney has already shown what a superb and detailed performer she is inthe FBI interrogation movie Reality, but this is far inferior: a stodgy, lifeless piece of work.● Christy is in UK and Irish cinemas from 28 November and in Australian cinemas on 8 January.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsSydney SweeneyDomestic violenceBen FosterBoxingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Daniel Craig returns as private detective Benoit Blanc, in a slightly more serious mode than before, with not as many droll suth’n phrases and quirky faux-naif mannerisms, but rocking a longer hairstyle and handsomely tailored three-piece suit.Blanc arrives at a Catholic church in upstate New York to investigate the sensational murder of its presiding priest, Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, a ferocious clerical alpha male played by Josh Brolin, thundering his reactionary views from the pulpit. (That“Monsignor” titlecan only be bestowed by the pope incidentally: presumably Benedict XVI or John Paul II, not milksop liberals like Francis or Leo XIV.) And prime suspect is the sweet-natured, thoughtful junior priest Father Jud Duplenticy, amusingly played by Josh O’Connor, who was upset by the Monsignor’s heartless attitudes and was caught on video threatening to cut him out of the church like a cancer. Atheist Blanc faces off with the young priest, a worldview culture-clash which leads to an extraordinary encounter with the Resurrection itself.The situation is complicated by the fact that Mgr Wicks was adored by a close-knit group of cranky and troubled parishioners, a hilariously cartoony lineup with a few resemblances to personae from the first Knives Out film. Wheelchair-using cellist Simone Vivane (Cailee Spaeny) is stricken with illness like Jacqueline du Pré; failing sci-fi novelist Lee Ross (Andrew Scott) is trying to convert his interminable Substack into a masterpiece; Vera Draven (Kerry Washington) is a lawyer whose stepson Cy Draven (Daryl McCormack) is a Trumpian influencer; Nat Sharp (Jeremy Renner) is a doctor losing his battle with the bottle; and church housekeeper Martha Delacroix (Glenn Close) is fiercely loyal to the Monsignor and is in turn adored by the groundskeeper Samson Holt (Thomas Haden Church). By the end, there’s a motive for each.It is an absolutely sparkling array of acting talent, with everyone at the top of their game, and Johnson teases us with references to many “locked room” detective mysteries, including those by John Dickson Carr, Dorothy L Sayers and Agatha Christie; classic texts whose playful purpose here is probably to divert and mislead. As with the previous two Knives Out films, the enjoyment is, for me, most intense before the actual murder itself, when we see the characters joust and spark unencumbered by murder and suspicion. There are hilarious scenes when Mgr Wicks insists that poor Jud hears his confession, which turns out to be a upsettingly detailed litany of masturbation episodes. Jud’s own confession is a stunningly effective counterblast.Then we get the murder, and then … well, it’s still thoroughly enjoyable, but should probably be considered more of a deadpan-absurdist ensemble comedy than a whodunnit. It is not really a question of twist and counter-twist, with the finger of suspicion moving from one person to another; it just gets more and more bizarrely convoluted. As with the previous Knives Out films, the characters are not, in fact, equally important and equally capable of murder. An inner core of suspects emerges and their guilt discloses itself incrementally at the end, as opposed to being withheld for a final reveal. What a treat though, with cracking turns from one and all and O’Connor the first among equals. Could he be the male star of the decade?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For me, Sirāt is the most overpraised movie of the year – exasperating and bizarre in ways that become less and less interesting and more and more ridiculous as the film wears on.There is a moment of tragic horror halfway through the action that is not absorbed or clarified and whose (presumed) emotional and spiritual consequences are not conveyed. It simply looks coercive and even slightly farcical. The later explosions in the desert are, frankly, Pythonesque. And yet, as withLaxe’s earlier film Mimosasthere are some wonderful visual moments and stylish shots of the Moroccan desert landscape. Veteran Spanish actor Sergi López gives Sirāt some ballast.Sirātis the Arabic word for the narrow, perilous path that takes you to paradise, and there is something interestingly ambiguous about the teeming crowds of people we initially see at a rave in the Moroccan desert. It’s a bravura setpiece. They look both like Dionysian ravers and lost souls writhing in hell.Two outsiders show up: middle-aged Luis (López) and his young son Esteban (Bruno Núñez Arjona) with their dog Pipa. (Esteban’s mother is not mentioned.) Luis pleadingly hands out leaflets with a photo to all the people there, asking desperately if they have seen his teen daughter, Mar, who vanished months before and was perhaps at a rave like this. They blearily shake their heads, some appearing faintly hostile to these interlopers, perhaps suspecting some sort of accusation, but some at least show a wary sympathy: Bigui (Richard “Bigui” Bellamy), Jade (Jade Oukid), Steff (Stefania Gadda) and Tonin (played by street-performer Tonin Janvier who has one leg, and later good-naturedly performs a song).Watch a trailer for SirātWhen the army arrives to break up the party, requisitioning the desert for military purposes, and attempts to shepherd everyone’s trucks away on an approved route, Bigui et al defiantly swerve out and drive away, heading for a second party somewhere in the remote vastness. Luis follows them in his car, sensing that the answer to Mar’s disappearance might lie in this direction. But should Luis be searching for Mar? She is an adult and may not want to be found.Well, the dual narrative possibilities and consequences fade away into nothingness as the story disappears into the sand, as does the question of whether the hippies and Luis could conceivably learn from each other. In their shock and despair after the tumultuous events that follow, they take psychoactive substances and dance to electronic music thumping out of their speakers. The film’s doors of perception remain closed. Sirāt is a path to nowhere, an improvised spectacle in the Sahara; it is very impressive in the opening 10 minutes but valueless as it proceeds, and a pointless mirage of unearned emotion.Sirāt is out now in the US, on 12 February in Australia and on 27 February in the UK.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsDance musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here is something different from Scrooge and his ghosts, though just as bracing a warm-up to the season of goodwill. Three actors perform this zesty bildungsroman about a Victorian boy’s travails through misfortune, adventure – and a formative trip to Yarmouth.Adapted and directed by Abigail Pickard Price, who was behind last year’sthree-person Pride and Prejudice, this is so much more than a parlour game. Produced by the Guildford Shakespeare Company, it is performed by Luke Barton (from Pride and Prejudice), Louise Beresford and Eddy Payne, and bears the quick-witted theatricality of the old Reduced Shakespeare Company. Like them, it retains the essence of the original, whittled down, with delightful dollops of mischief and invention.Scene changes are fleet, evoked by a swivel of suitcases, from which props are lifted, but which also gesture at David’s travels into adulthood. Yarmouth, where he meets Emily, Ham and Co, is conjured with waves unwound from the folds of Emily’s turquoise dress. David’s stepfather, Edward Murdstone, is represented by a hat and coat puppet; this facelessness renders him convincingly imposing as he inflicts his violent “firmness” on his stepson.View image in fullscreenComic eccentricity … (from left) Louise Beresford, Luke Barton and Eddy Payne in David Copperfield at Jermyn Street theatre, London.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThere are some plot omissions and minor characters missing, while David’s attraction to Emily isn’t given time to take hold emotionally. But it is remarkable how much of Dickens’ densely plotted story and great sprawl of characters three actors manage to juggle, and so charmingly.David is played by Payne, who has both the bearing of a boy and man. Barton brings excellent physical comedy to his transformations – from the matronly Peggotty to Micawber, Spenlow and more. Beresford is bewitching as she shuttles between David’s “child-wife” Dora to his rakish school-friend Steerforth, among others.Sometimes they change costumes on stage, sometimes switch between characters by donning different hats. Only on a few occasions does it feel too frenetic. In its comic eccentricity, it isreminiscent of Armando Iannucci’s film. The tragic notes of the story are struck too, in the fates of Emily, Ham and David’s various losses.Never mind the ghost of Christmas past. David Copperfield brings the Dickens magic here.AtJermyn Street theatre, London, until 20 December.Explore more on these topicsTheatreCharles DickensJermyn Street TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Instead, there’s an ailing pot plant and a bucket to catch the drips. It’s the understudies’ lair in a West End production ofJulius Caesar. Some big name plays Caesar (consensus is he’s a bit of a dick), while our guys cover the chief assassins. They don’t even get their own names here – just Understudy Brutus and Understudy Cassius.Night after night they skulk, waiting for the call that never comes, the show Tannoy an implacable reminder of the parade passing them by. For the show’s 100th performance, they celebrate with party hats, microwave popcorn and a run-through of the play they may never deliver for real.View image in fullscreenWaiting for the call that never comes … Adam Goodbody and John Chisham.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhy should only stars get to shine? The production itself, huff the understudies, isn’t up to much. They might save it, if they only had the chance. They quietly wish that someone would really break a leg – what if they’re not just killing time but, possibly, also one of the leads?Actor Adam Goodbody founded Buzz Studios in memory of his auntBuzz, pioneering director of “studio Shakespeare”, who died 50 years ago. In the company’s debut show, his Understudy Cassius is over-prepared, line-sharp; John Chisham’s slouching colleague spikes his tea with whisky. They zip through the script with varying degrees of intensity, paraphrase and chatty commentary.The pair, who devised the play with director Júlia Levai, smartly identify how comradeship turns competitive in Shakespeare – the assassination marks the moment when Brutus and Cassius are closest and yet when their bond starts to shred. In Levai’s inventive production, the drab room (design by Tomás Palmer) cracks open to phantasms and hideous dreams, and the captioning goes wild.Although bold in form, Petty Men feels like a narrow reading of the play, circling around personal ambition rather than political conviction. Julius Caesar is a play for our No Kings era. Murder to save the state is one thing; but however highly charged the bubble of a theatre production seems, it can’t matter as much as the fate of actual Rome.AtArcola theatre, London, until 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreArcola theatreJulius CaesarreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Polish pianist and composer’s erudite yet accessible work often defies genres, appealing to classical, jazz and electronic aficionados alike. This concert comprised two 40-minute premieres and fell pretty firmly into the classical category, yet the lively audience skewed significantly younger than the Brahms and Beethoven crowd. Stylishly performed by the envelope-pushing Manchester Collective, it felt like quite the happening.Shining occupied the first half, a piece devised for the kind of 12-piece band favoured by Steve Reich and Philip Glass. It’s based on a short story by Jon Fosse; a stream of consciousness tale of a man lost in the woods at night. Opening with sinister discords on bass clarinet, bassoon and horn, its motifs shifted and spun. A pall of smoke and half-lit players conjured images of a ghost story told around a campfire at midnight.Later, motoric rhythms kicked in, with instruments poking their heads above water only to be submerged again in the undertow. At one point bows bounced off strings like twigs tapping on a windowpane. As with the best minimalist music, Shining draws you in, heightening the senses to each and every rhythmic or harmonic shift.View image in fullscreenAbsorbing … Hania Rani at Barbican Hall, London.Photograph: Sian O’ConnorNon Fiction, Rani’s five-years-in-the-making piano concerto, was inspired by the sketchbooks of Josima Feldschuh, a young pianist forced into the Warsaw ghetto in 1940. The music – frequently ethereal, occasionally sombre and incorporating aleatoric passages – channels human resilience in the face of oppression. In her eloquent program note, the composer speaks of its contemporary resonances.On paper it’s as absorbing a work as Shining. The soloist – Rani herself – juggled upright and grand pianos, all the while pitted against a multihued 47-piece orchestra including mournful soprano saxophone, busy harp, bass and alto flutes, celesta and electronic tape. At its haunting best, its unrooted harmonies framed sepia-tinted snapshots emerging from the distorting mists of time. In practice, however, balance issues scuppered any feeling of a concerto, the piano drowned in the lavish orchestration. A shame, because otherwise this rather beautiful music had a great deal to say.Repeated on 26 November.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBarbicanPolandreviewsShareReuse this content"

This is the way of modern pop stardom: spectacle, not music, is what gets phones in the air, with footage that then gets picked apart on TikTok and Instagram.Doja Cat has been singing about this inanity for years – “You follow me, but you don’t really care about the music,” she spat out on her 2023 track Attention – and in Auckland, she was having none of it. “I’m not your fucking costume monkey, I move at my own pace and break my fucking back out there every night so you can keep your bullshit opinion to yourself,” she wrote on X after the show. “You are not the artist, you are the watcher.”Doja Cat’s unapologetic prickliness makes for good headlines –the BBC covered the pouting in Auckland, while seemingly every Australian tabloid has blastedher 15-minute appearance at a Melbourne club earlier this week,which abruptly ended after three songs (to be fair, she was supposed to be on vocal rest for a sore throat). All of this could paint a picture of a pop star who hates her fans, which simply isn’t true; Doja Cat just loves fighting on the internet more. As sheonce put it to Variety, “It’s fun for me. I’m a very messy bitch.”And she really does break her back out there. On Tuesday night at Melbourne’s Rod Laver arena, she stalks, twerks and writhes around the stage for close to two hours. She is a rare performer who can sing as well as she can rap live, and is able to switch from dreamy love song to demonic screech on a dime.View image in fullscreenHer latest album Vie is hugely 80s inflected and you can not only hear but also see the era’s inspiration.Photograph: Duncan BarnesThere might be no costume changes but there are fireworks, hellish flames and one very bold outfit: a messy pink wig, a very high cut leopard print bodysuit, and half a face of dramatic makeup, like a clown who has had to rush off to a Duran Duran concert.Her latest album Vieis hugely 80s inflected and from the concert opener Cards, you can not only hear but also see the era’s inspirations – the playful theatricality of Madonna and Prince, the provocative sexiness of Janet Jackson and, when she pulls her most demonic faces, licks the mic stand and bites off one of her fake nails to throw into the crowd, even a shadow of Ozzy Osbourne. (She’d front a great metal band.)Much like her hero Nicki Minaj, Doja Cat is a witty and dedicated performer: after a triumphant and jazzy rendition of Paint the Town Red, she turns away and picks her bodysuit out of her bum with a cheeky flick of her leg. Occasionally some syllables get lost in the wall of sound, but whether that is her throat, the mic, the arena’s speakers or the crowd drowning her out, who knows – and it doesn’t have too much impact when everyone is singing along.Vie sounds even better live, with a fantastically tight band that is heavy on brass, throbbing bass and even keytar; Gorgeous, which could have been a Madonna song 40 years ago or a George Michael song in another life, is a standout with its sax solo. The band really helps the newer songs stand out – One More Time, Take Me Dancing, Aaahh Men! and the closer Jealous Type, the song of summer 2025 – though all the older hits (Wet Vagina, Ain’t Shit, Boss Bitch) benefit from funkier arrangements too.For almost two hours, every song is screamed back at Doja Cat word for word, and she wraps up with a sweet thank you, laughing in clear delight. Anyone who would complain after a show like this needs to get more than their eyes and ears checked.Doja Cat’s Ma Vie world tour continues in Brisbane on 29 November and Sydney 1-2 December, before heading around the world.Explore more on these topicsDoja CatMelbournereviewsShareReuse this content"

They explain how his nude paintings of her helped them process their grief – and eventual joyWed 26 Nov 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 26 Nov 2025 06.18 ESTShare‘The subject comes with huge baggage and I like that,” says Tom de Freston. The painter and I are in his studio in a village outside Oxford, surrounded by nude portraits of his wife, the novelistKiran Millwood Hargrave. “I wanted to ask, ‘What does it mean as a male artist to be looking at the female figure? And where does the agency sit?’”We have been talking aboutTitian’s Poesie series, how those paintings – commissioned by the most powerful man in the world at the time, King Philip II of Spain – fetishise the naked female body. “Obviously there’s other things going on in them … I think Titian’s often prodding at morality and power,” De Freston says.Titian’s works are a central inspiration for works on display as part of Poíēsis, De Freston’s first major exhibition at London’s Varvara Roza Galleries. He has lifted some of Titian’s figures on to his own canvases, playing with the idea of the male gaze.View image in fullscreenOn the Edge of the Forest.Photograph: Tom de Freston/Peter Mallet PhotographyThese large-scale paintings are alongside those of Millwood Hargrave at various stages of pregnancy, created as the couple endured seven pregnancy losses before the birth of their daughter, Coral, in 2023. De Freston wrote about the miscarriages – and Titian – in his acclaimed book Strange Bodies, but these paintings were initially not intended to be exhibited, but were rather just a way of processing his own grief. “It was like the studio was my space to work through stuff that was beyond language, without burdening Kiran with it.”It was also an act of empathy. Over the years, De Freston has painted Millwood Hargrave in a range of mythological guises, but it is the story of Eurydice and Orpheus that resonated the most: her unreachability, his need to look to her, questions about the distances between men and women and of course the feeling of being on the threshold of an underworld of grief and loss, hoping for a pregnancy resulting in a live birth.You can’t deny the male gaze in these works: it’s there. “You’re trying to get to this figure, or to their unseen internal world. And even though you’re intimately connected to them, you can’t,” he explains. The subject’s unreachability, in other words, is the whole point.Despite efforts to reframe it, the dynamic between a male artist and his female muse still holds powerful sway in many people’s minds, but De Freston and Millwood Hargrave’s relationship is not one of “active artist and passive subject”. Rather, she is a collaborator. “Her voice is hugely present in the work,” says De Freston.“These aren’t posed,” agrees Millwood Hargrave, when we speak by phone a few days later. “They are all from photographs that he took in the domestic space throughout my pregnancies.” I ask her if such intimacy being made public feels exposing in any way. “When he first talked to me about using these photographs, I was just excited, because this body of work is the most beautiful I’ve ever seen Tom create,” she says. “They’re not sexualised. They’re worshipful and considered and you can feel the love in them.”View image in fullscreenBoth of Us Sorting Shadows, 2024.Photograph: Tom de Freston/Peter Mallet PhotographyExplorations of pregnancy and especially of miscarriage still feel quite rare in visual art. De Freston has made a bold attempt at empathy and succeeded in capturing that mix of grief and hope. Furthermore, they record a time that is precious. “They do feel like elegies,” says Millwood Hargrave. “I think any painting feels like an act of mourning anyway, because you’re trying to capture something that is gone. We were so ecstatic and scared in this [last] pregnancy.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, he was flooded with a sense of wonder and connection. “There was a sudden shattering of the lie of the individual,” he says. “You have this sense of you as this artist, with the importance of your vision of the world. And obviously, having a child, you become so intimately aware of the interconnectedness of everything.”The work he made before parenthood was, by his own admission, very heavy. These paintings are far more hopeful. A lot of magical thinking goes on in pregnancy, especially when you’ve had losses. De Freston agrees: “I think of them as ritualistic, like spells. And in a kind of secular way, like prayers.”Tom de Freston: Poíēsiswill be at Varvara Roza Galleries, London, from 30 November to 20 DecemberExplore more on these topicsPaintingArtExhibitionsPregnancyMiscarriageFamilyHealth & wellbeinginterviewsShareReuse this content"

I am standing on the first level of Fremantle’s former P&O hotel, and am immediately taken aback by its weathered, almost cinematic beauty: tall stained-glass windows, dark timber mouldings and an iron-framed balcony peering over High Street like some forgotten lookout.First built about 1870 and renovated during the gold-rush era, for almost a century this building was a magnet for wharfies and crewmen, with its 31 rooms and a raucous sailors’ bar known as the Cockpit. But despite being in the centre of Fremantle’s busiest street, this historical relic has largely remained empty and off-limits for decades.View image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLeft: Sculptural artist Abdul Rahman Abdullah’s work, In the name, draws on his childhood when the scarcity of halal meat brought animal slaughter and butchery into his family’s suburban back yard. Right: A chandelier forms part of his work Wednesday’s ChildBut on 29 and 30 November, the public are invited inside for Room Service, a maze of performances and installations that forms part of the Fremantle Biennale. For the past three weeks, more than 40 musicians, poets, painters and multimedia artists have occupied the upper floor, creating varied works in response to its chequered history.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning“I don’t think people realise how much latent creative output becomes possible when property owners have the will and vision to back a simple idea,” says musician Danielle Caruana AKA Mama Kin, who co-curated Room Service with Tom Mùller. “It activates our greatest asset of all, which is our ideas.”It was in the P&O hotel’s ground floor rooms that a group of local artists, including Caruana, meeting weekly under the name Culture Club, first began to wonder why a site of such character and centrality remained mostly inaccessible. They found themselves circling the same question: what could this place become if artists were allowed in?View image in fullscreenRoom Service’s artistic directors Tom Mùller and Danielle Caruana (aka Mama Kin)So when the building’s current owners, Nic Trimboli and Adrian Fini – behind Fremantle hospitality ventures such as Little Creatures and Bread in Common – offered the venue for use as part of the biennale, Caruana and her collaborators leapt at the opportunity. Trimboli and Fini plan to revive the P&O as a hotel, but for now its upstairs rooms belong to the artists.When I visit, composer Iain Grandage and cellist and vocalist Mel Robinson are setting up for a cello duet in one of the hotel’s bathrooms. Drawn to the building’s maritime past and the crew who lodged here – “often completely alone”, as Grandage says – the duo created a new interpretation of the 19th-century sailor song Little Fish.“If you strip it away, you get a gut-wrenching kind of loneliness,” Robinson says. “A sailor sings a love song to a fish.” A prerecorded soundtrack of waves and water sounds will play alongside their live performance, forming what Robinson calls “an oceanic kind of sound installation”.View image in fullscreenMusician and formerPerthfestival artistic director Iain Grandage and his partner Mel RobinsonFurther up the corridor, Whadjuk Balladong and Wilman Noongar artist Zali Morgan has lined a small room with recycled brown paper, awash with watercolours. Her starting point was the building’s location: a few minutes’ walk from the Round House, a former colonial prison where many Aboriginal men were held before being sent to a labour camp on Wadjemup (Rottnest Island) in the 19th century.View image in fullscreenWhadjuk Balladong and Wilman Noongar Artist Zali Morgan’s painting of the nearby Round House responds to ‘the heaviness of the site’. It was the Swan River Colony’s first prison, where Aboriginal prisoners were kept before being sent to Rottnest Island for forced labour“I couldn’t really make work without addressing that history of the site, and the colonial legacy that Fremantle is built on,” Morgan says. Her “gestural watercolour marks” respond, as she puts it, to “the heaviness of the site”, turning the room into a quiet, hand-painted reckoning with place.Another room is filled with a chorus of animated faces drawn from the hotel’s past: sailors, nurses, bellboys and a beloved 19th-century landlady. The work, by Ellen Broadhurst, features rotoscoped faces which she projected over a large papier-mache head. “This is the ghost of everyone who’s ever been in this room,” she says. “They’re all kind of in hell and heaven, in purgatory and in this room at once.”View image in fullscreenEllen Broadhurst with her work, The Golem of Room 15Artist Guy Louden has turned his room into a playable climate dystopia: Wet End, a jetski game set in a future Fremantle swallowed by rising seas. The game is deliberately “trashy, oversaturated … over-juiced and turbo,” he says. In it, a dolphin declares “we’re totally fucked” and a sea god replies “capitalism is cancer”. Wet End’s upbeat development-speak, borrowed from property boosterism, reflects what Louden calls our “split vision” – knowing catastrophe is coming while still pursuing growth. “It’s about complicity,” he says. “You’re not outside the problem, you’re racing in it.”This art is rubbish: why artists meticulously recreate our trash – so well they even confuse cleanersRead moreArchitect Nic Brunsdon has taken a different approach, stripping the room back to imagine what stood here long before the hotel – the trees, soil and coastal ecology that once shaped this part of Fremantle. Working with a natural-dye researcher, a scent artist, a sculptor and a furniture maker, he has created a quiet, sensory refuge of marri timber, hand-carved sandstone, bush aromas and vast rust-coloured curtains. The idea, he says, was to build “a meditative little pause space” that transports visitors to an imagined pre-colonial landscape.View image in fullscreenNic Brunsdon built a ‘meditative little pause space’ involving sculpture and scent to evoke precolonial FremantleAs we loop back around to the beginning, Caruana shows me the bathroom studio where she will be presenting a sound-led installation made with film-maker Luna Laure. The shower stall will be darkened, with a holographic figure flickering inside it, accompanied by a looping soundtrack Caruana composed around the ritual of release. “It’s this idea of like, rinse, reflect, repeat,” she says.Later, as we make our way down the staircase, Caruana reflects on what Room Service is really revealing. “Empty spaces are a vacuum,” she says. “They create these kind of gaps in continuity. They create gaps in an experience of connectivity.”She hopes more property owners recognise the opportunity in inviting artists and creators into these gaps. “There’s an abundance of people … being like, can we use your space?” And the shift, she adds, is remarkably simple. “It doesn’t take much to say yes.”Room Servicetakes place 29-30 November at P&O hotel, 25 High Street, Fremantle, as part of the Fremantle BiennaleExplore more on these topicsPerthArtGame cultureSound artGamesWestern AustraliafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s the second day of a wintry weekend in Croyde, north-west Devon; I’m stiff from an hour in the sea the previous afternoon, and the upper part of the super-thick wetsuit won’t budge past my elbows. Together, my husband, Mark, and I jiggle and pull and yank it over my limbs. Finally, five minutes later, I am in a silver-blue sea, entirely empty, save for us. White-crested waves roll in, broiling and foaming, rocketing us forward towards the empty swathe of sand. For once there are no other boarders to dodge, no surfers whisking past: it’s exhilarating, extraordinary and … really rather cold.Map of north-west DevonCroyde has long been a family favourite, but visiting in November does feel a bit of a gamble. It has a reputation as something of a ghost town in the off-season, with a large number of second homes and rentals that stay dark from October to April. But when an unexpected email landed from Endless Summer Beach House offering a 20% discount on winter stays, it seemed the ideal 30th birthday treat for my nephew, Ben. So, together with his girlfriend, Tasha, best mate, Rob, and my sister Caroline, we decided to take the plunge and find out what off-season Croyde is actually like.When Mark and I arrive, the sky is unexpectedly blue, and we pull on our wetsuits and head straight for the sea. One of the joys of Croyde is that it doesn’t really change: the dunes that separate the beach from the village are strictly protected, saving both from the development that has scarred nearby resorts such as Westward Ho! and Woolacombe. Instead, the fields that flank the dunes are alive with rabbits grazing quietly, scampering away in white-tailed flashes as we pass.View image in fullscreenAnnabelle and her husband, Mark, on Croyde beach.Photograph: Annabelle ThorpeAt first, it feels strange to find the beach so deserted, but seeing it free of windbreaks, ballgames and pop-up tents renders its raw, natural beauty even more dramatic. It’s no wonder the place gets overrun in the summer months, when the sea froths with hundreds of bodyboarders and surfers, red and yellow lifeguard flags billowing in the breeze. Today there is nothing but sky and sea: a jagged patch of blue above the long curve of Hartland Point, a curtain of misty rain slowly dissipating Lundy island into the flint-grey wash of the ocean.The people we pass are smiley and friendly – a shared delight at having Croyde’s gorgeous dunes and coastline pretty much to ourselvesLater, when I nip into the village to pick up some bread, the narrow main street is almost as deserted as the beach. TheSaltrocksurfwear shop is open, as isThe Hub, beloved by Ben for its lemon crunch ice-cream (and all of us for the pasties). The Post Office shows distinct signs of life, as doesThe Thatchpub, but otherwise most places are closed until spring. As I stroll back, I think about how it takes 15 minutes to queue for an ice-cream in summer, with the Post Office out of anything fresh by about 9.30am.View image in fullscreenWalking on Baggy Point, from left: Rob, Mark, Annabelle, Caroline, Tasha and Ben.Photograph: Annabelle ThorpeNot everything is shrouded in silence. When we head to The Thatch for dinner on Friday night, the place is packed and buzzy (I had feared it might just be us), although I suspect almost everyone else is local. As ever, the food is fantastic: crisp salt and pepper squid and a Balinese seafood curry, tangy with lemongrass and galangal, served with a heap of coconut sambal that adds up to the best dish I’ve eaten out all year. The boys find room for banoffee pie and apple tart.There are plenty of other signs of life, too. On Saturday, we head to Braunton (15 minutes’ drive) for the annual firework display, heading down pretty lanes we didn’t even know existed – we never usually get much further than the car park and the Co-op. It’s lovely to get a sense of the place as itreallyis, with all the flummery and frenetic pace of summer stripped away. On the walk to the beach, the few people we pass are smiley and friendly – a shared delight at having Croyde’s gorgeous dunes and coastline pretty much to ourselves.Coming away out of season has other benefits too: we don’t expect good weather, so a sunny Saturday is an absolute boon. When it rains all day Sunday, we pull on wet weather gear and stride out aroundBaggy Point, where the sea – now a palette of steel, platinum and foaming white – is just as spectacular as under blue skies. Once it’s dark, we play board-games, watch old films, eat hearty curries and bolognese – with no squabbling over why the barbecue won’t light and whether the sausages are cooked through.View image in fullscreenThe Thatch pub.Photograph: Richard Naude/AlamyThe problem with tagging places such as Croyde as “ghost towns” in the off-season is that it deters people from visiting – the very thing our seaside resorts need most. The village was quiet, but far from dead – and, frankly, if you go with a group, you make your own atmosphere anyway. By the time we were packing the cars on Monday lunchtime (another off-season bonus is that accommodation owners are often more flexible about arrival and departure times), we were already talking about booking a return visit next November. Some might call Croyde a ghost town, but it had all the spirit we needed for an early winter break.Endless Summer Beach House, sleeps 10, from£920 for a three-night break.

Originally introduced by Danish immigrants in the late 19th century, they’re essentially a big ring of flaky Viennese pastry filled with fruit or nuts, then iced and served in little slices. Even bad kringles are pretty delicious, and when out-of-towners try them for the first time, their reaction is usually: ”Where has this been all my life?”We eat kringles year-round, but I mainly associate them with fall, perhaps because of their common autumnal fillings such as apple or cranberry, or perhaps because of the sense ofhyggethey provide. I also associate kringles with Thanksgiving – and with uncles. And I don’t think it’s just me; Racine’s biggest kringle baker,O&H Danish Bakery, operates a cafe/shop called “Danish Uncle”. But I also think of Thanksgiving as the most uncle-y American holiday, geared towards watching football and snoozing on the couch.On Thanksgiving, you get together with your uncles (who all have strong, reliable uncle names such as Steve, Bob and Mike), and you talk about kringles, because you can’t talk about feelings or politics. Kringles are naturally convivial and conversational; Racinians will never eat kringle without debating the merits of various local bakeries (for the record: I’m aBendtsen’sman until I die). Maybe the conversation never gets that deep with your uncles; maybe you can’t tell them that you love them, or even give them a hug that isn’t unnatural and awkward. But that’s OK, you can give them kringle instead.Cherry marzipan kringleServes8-10220g lukewarm milk25g caster sugar7g sachet dried yeast1 tsp salt200g strong white bread flour160g plain flour40g plain wholemeal flour200g cold unsalted butter230g marzipan100g sour cherry jam or compoteBeaten egg,to glazeIcing sugarIn a large bowl, combine the lukewarm milk, caster sugar, dried yeast, and a teaspoon of salt, then whisk to dissolve the ingredients into the milk.In a second bowl, mix the flours. Tip the flours into the milk mix, then stir with a spatula until everything comes together into a dough. Knead in the bowl until the dough has an even texture, without any dry or sticky patches, then cover loosely and leave to prove for one hour.Make a butter block by cutting the cold butter into 12 slices, then tiling them into a rectangle along a length of baking paper, two by six slices of butter across. Fold the paper over the top of the butter like an envelope, then use a rolling pin to flatten the butter and press the edges of each slice together, to make a thin, solid block about 14cm x 32cm. Keep the butter wrapped in the paper, and transfer to the fridge.Roll the risen dough into a large roughly 16cm x 70cm rectangle. Peel the paper off the butter block, then putthebutter block in the centre of the dough. Fold the sides of the pastry up over the top and press down on the edges to enclose the butter. Fold the dough in by thirds (like you would a letter) to make three layers of butter, then put in a container and chill for 30 minutes.Rotate the dough into a landscape position, then roll it into a 30cm x 20cm rectangle. Fold into thirds again, then return to the fridge for another 30 minutes. Repeat this process once more, chilling again for 30 minutes.Cut the marzipan into thin slices about 2mm thick. Cut the dough lengthways into two long rectangles, then roll each piece to 16cm x 70cm. Spoon the cherry jam or compote in a line down the centre of the dough, then lay half of the marzipan in a single layer on top of the jam. Fold the far edge of dough towards you and over the filling, and then fold the near edge of dough over the top of that, and pinch to seal. Curl the line of dough round to make a ring, tucking one end into the other. Repeat the process to make a second kringle.Carefully transfer the rings to two trays lined with baking paper, brush the surface of each with beaten egg, then bake at 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ for 22 minutes, until well browned. Leave to cool, then flatten each kringle by laying another tray on to the surface and pressing down firmly. Drizzle with thick icing made with icing sugar and water, and leave to set before slicing and serving.Tim Anderson is the author of the 24 Hour Pancake People newsletter and Hokkaido: Recipes from the Seas, Fields and Farmlands of Northern Japan, published by Hardie Grant at £28.

Especially when you finish roasting them in a glaze made with butter (or, even better, saved chicken, pork, beef or goose fat) and the last scrapings from aMarmitejar.Marmite roast potatoesI’ve always been fanatical about Marmite, so much so that I refuse to waste a single scoop. I used to wrestle with a butter knife, scraping endlessly at the jar’s sticky bottom, until I learned that there’s a reason the rounded pot has a small flat spot on each side. When you get close to the end of the jar, store the pot on its side, so the last of that black gold inside pools neatly into the side for easy removal. Those stubborn dregs work brilliantly in this recipe, and transform your roast spuds into the most flavour-packed ones you’ll ever eat. But go easy: Marmite is potent stuff, and even the last few scrapings will go a long way.Serves44 tbsp olive oil800g potatoesAbout 2 tbsp Marmite– top up the last scrapings of a jar as required25g butter, or saved meat fat (chicken, pork, beef or goose fat)Sea salt, to tasteChives, finely chopped, to finishSouredcream(optional)Put the oil into a roasting tray, then put it in a 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½ oven to heat up. Cut the potatoes into 5cm-7½cm chunks, leaving them unpeeled. Put the spuds in a large pan, cover with cold water, add a good pinch of sea salt and bring to a boil, covered, ideally, to save energy. Simmer for about eight minutes, until fork-tender, then drain and leave to steam in the colander for a few minutes.Toss the potatoes to rough up their edges, then carefully tip into the hot oil and toss again to coat. Squash each potato slightly with the back of a spoon, but only just enough so they split open, then return the tray to the oven and roast for about 45 minutes, until the potatoes turn golden and start to crisp up.Meanwhile, stand a nearly empty Marmite jar in a saucepan filled with a little hot water and simmer gently to loosen the contents of the jar (you’ll need about two tablespoons in total, so top up if need be). Add the butter (or saved fat) to the jar, leave to melt, then scrape down the insides of the jar and stir to combine the Marmite with the butter or fat.Once completely melted and loose, drizzle the Marmite glaze all over the potatoes, toss gently, then return to the oven for a final 10-15 minutes, until deeply crisp and caramelised. Finish with optional finely chopped chives and serve with soured cream, if you like.Explore more on these topicsPotatoesWaste notFoodFood wasteSide dishesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
